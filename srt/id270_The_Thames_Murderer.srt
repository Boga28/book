CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,320
A Horrible Discovery

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,600
The sun was setting over London in red and orange flames
that made the rows of old buildings blush and glow.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,560
It had been another hot day in one of the longest heat waves
the city had seen in the last decade.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:27,200
Now the streets were busy with after-work traffic; the drivers were trying to make it home to their cool, shady
lawns as quickly as possible.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:36,280
The alleys were filled with pedestrians who were looking forward to a pleasant supper in one of London's many
restaurants, coffee shops or fast-food places.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,960
Others were walking their dogs along the River Thames, now
that the temperature had cooled down a little.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,400
Jennifer Clearwater walked along the riverbank, dreaming
about her trip to Bermuda.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,360
Was there anything she had forgotten to put on her list of
"Things To Put In The Suitcase"?

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:05,480
Jeans, T-shirts, shorts, sandals, Jeffrey's bathing trunks, her own bathing suit... oh yes, and that pretty little
bikini she had recently bought at "Gray's".

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,160
It had pink and white stripes.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:16,640
"You look like a candy cane - sweet enough to eat," Jeffrey had remarked dryly when she had shown off her new two-piece
bathing suit to him.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,280
She could hardly wait to get on that airplane with her husband, whom she still adored even after seven years of
happy marriage.

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,920
First she glanced at her watch, then she looked for Polly, their poodle, who had disappeared in the bushes by the water
five minutes ago.

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,880
"Polly," she called.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,400
"Polly, come on, we've got to go now!"

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,240
No sight nor sound of Polly.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,040
"Polly!" Jennifer called again.

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,440
"Polly, come back, will you? Where are you, POLLY?!"

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,400
Suddenly she heard a faint bark behind her.

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,720
It seemed to come from the river's edge.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,000
She stopped and turned round, walked back a few steps and
listened.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,080
Yes, that definitely was Polly's high-pitched bark.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,400
"Yap! Yap! Yap!" She sounded excited and upset.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,640
Jennifer pushed the twigs aside and ducked right through the hedges along the river, until she saw the water shimmering
in the last sun rays of the day.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
"Polly!" she cried.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,680
The poodle responded with a series of excited barks from
somewhere round the next bend.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,880
The young woman walked hastily round the bend and saw her dog growl at something that looked like a long white branch
floating in the water.

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,640
No, it had to be something like a thick white pole because blue fabric, maybe a flag or tent or something else, was
attached to it.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,600
This was what Polly was growling at - or rather pulling at.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,760
"Polly! Come here! Let go of it, will you? We've got to go!"

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,960
The dog let go of the blue fabric but did not move from her
spot.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,080
Instead she started on another series of barks.

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,960
"Polly! Leave that thing alone, will you? Come on, be a good
doggy! We've got to go home to Daddy!"

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Jennifer moved closer to put Polly on the lead and saw
something that looked like a mop of wet black hair.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Then she froze.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Oh my God, she thought.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
OH NO.

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
It can't be!

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
It couldn't... could it?

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,480
It was.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,320
It was another one of the Thames Murderer's victims.

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,440
It was the body of a dead woman whose hair had got tangled
in a bush.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
She was wearing a dress as blue as the sky.

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,400
Oh my God, Jennifer thought.

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,640
"Help!" she screamed.

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,800
"Help! Murder! HELP!"

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,760
Then she grabbed Polly and ran back to civilisation to
notify the police.

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,720
Shortly after six-thirty p.m.

50
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,400
Inspector Hudson put down the receiver with a sigh.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:56,840
He had been expecting that phone call - in fact, he had been wondering for the past month or so when they would give up
and assign him to the Thames Murder Case.

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,920
Now he had both of them.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,160
And he didn't like it.

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,560
No, sir, he didn't like it one bit.

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:13,280
Because he had secretly been following up on Scotland Yard's investigations and felt that the murders of two beautiful
young women, found drifting in the river, were tricky cases.

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,000
Nothing linked the victims to each other, as far as he knew.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,280
The murderer seemed to pick them randomly in lonely parks
after dark.

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,640
They seemed to have nothing in common, except that the second woman had been found exactly four weeks after the
first one.

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:38,320
About a week after the first murder, a note had been sent to Scotland Yard, mocking their failure to find the murderer
and signed "Jack the Skipper".

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,480
Along with the letter, he had also sent the belt that
belonged to the victim's dress.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,560
When the body was examined, it was found that the first
victim had been strangled with that very belt.

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,240
What a horrible case, James Hudson thought.

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,640
There was a knock on his door.

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,080
"Come in," he called.

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,880
His secretary entered with a thick folder.

66
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
"The Thames Murder Case, sir - they just brought it over."

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:16,080
"Thanks, I've been waiting for that." Eagerly he took the heavy folder from her and leafed through it until he found
the note the Yard had received one week after the first murder.

68
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
It was handwritten in capital letters.

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,960
"Will that be all, sir?" she asked.

70
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:32,080
"Because if you don't need me anymore, I would like to finish for the day. It's almost seven o'clock." "What? Oh -
yes, thank you," he answered without paying attention.

71
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,920
His thoughts were on the note.

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,840
The secretary shrugged and left, shutting the door behind
her.

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,040
"Still fumbling in the dark, aren't you?" the note read.

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:51,520
"You shouldn't be - it was bright enough when I strangled
the poor lamb with this pretty beige belt, haha!"

75
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,360
Despite his many years of experience a cold shiver ran down
his spine.

76
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:06,880
He sensed he was about to deal with a very smart and evil mind and wondered if "Jack the Skipper" would again send the
murder weapon together with another note.

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,200
On his way home Hudson could not stop thinking about the
mocking note.

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,280
His many years of dealing with all kinds of criminals told
him that there was a hidden meaning between the lines.

79
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,720
The note was too short for someone who wasted words.

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Why did the sender point out that it had been "bright" when
he had strangled the woman?

81
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,160
And what did he want to say with the name "Skipper"?

82
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,040
Was the man they were looking for a sailor?

83
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,720
The inspector was so caught up in his thoughts that he
almost over-looked an old woman crossing the street.

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:45,680
He frantically slammed on the brakes and smiled an apology to the little old lady who was furiously shaking her
umbrella at him.

85
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,880
"Get a grip on yourself, old man!" he told himself while
wiping the sweat off his forehead.

86
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,760
"Don't get too caught up in the case. You have to keep cool
to find the bastard!"

87
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:06,120
When James Hudson finally got home at nine o'clock, he found Miss Paddington - his loyal housekeeper, cook, budget
manager and drill sergeant - in the kitchen.

88
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,280
She was busy scraping something black and burned out of a
baking tray.

89
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,320
The whole house smelled as if it had been set on fire.

90
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,320
"Oh my," she said nervously when she saw the inspector.

91
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,560
"I'm afraid I burned our supper."

92
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,160
"What is it?" he wanted to know.

93
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
"Or rather - what WAS it?"

94
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,720
"Your favourite meal - my homemade pork pie," she mumbled
without looking at him, scraping away furiously.

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:43,480
"I'm so sorry but today just isn't my day! I didn't get any sleep last night. I tossed and turned and stayed awake all
night - and today I'm completely useless!"

96
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:54,840
"You're never useless," Hudson replied politely, even though his stomach was growling hungrily, and right now he would
have given anything for one of Miss Paddington's delicious pork pies.

97
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:14,200
"You're too kind, Inspector. But it's always the same when there is a full moon. I tried a cup of warm milk, and it
didn't work. Then I even tried this special meditation that is supposed to make you tired no matter what. Oh yes, it made me tired alright! But I still couldn't fall asleep. Now I'm just a tired wreck."

98
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,160
"What did you just say?" the inspector asked
absent-mindedly.

99
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,640
"I said I'm a tired wreck."

100
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:31,760
"No, I mean before that - did you say something about a 'full moon'?" "Oh yes, the full moon! We had a full moon
last night. Didn't you notice?"

101
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,800
Indeed Hudson, whose body did not care whether the moon was
full or not, hadn't noticed.

102
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
But now he remembered something.

103
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,200
"So last night was rather bright, wasn't it?" he inquired.

104
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,840
Miss Paddington looked at him as if she thought that his
question was not too bright.

105
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,000
"Yes, of course, Inspector. There were no clouds in the
sky."

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,920
Hudson forgot his hungry stomach when something dawned on
him.

107
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,240
"Why - of course!" he exclaimed.

108
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:08,120
"Last night we had a full moon! That's what he meant with
'bright'! Miss Paddington, you're simply brilliant!"

109
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,160
The housekeeper was not too sure whether her beloved boss
was still in his right mind or not.

110
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,000
Could it be that the hot sun had scrambled his brains?

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Or perhaps the full moon had gotten to him?

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Maybe it affected people differently, so that some could not sleep (like her), while others could not think straight
(like him)?

113
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Hudson took one look at her and explained hastily: "Today they assigned the Thames Murder Cases to me. That's why I
came home so late tonight. And as it turned out, the murderer seems to always strike during a full moon, because a second victim was found early this evening."

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,440
"Oh my God, how horrible!" Miss Paddington was so shocked
she dropped the cooking pot she had been scrubbing.

115
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,760
This was news to her.

116
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,640
The media had not been told yet, because Scotland Yard had to notify the victim's family before the sad news could be
made public.

117
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:13,160
"Yes, and I wouldn't even have noticed if it hadn't been for
your remark about the fall moon! Perhaps I should retire and let YOU handle the case!"

118
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,280
That was a very flattering compliment, and for a second Miss
Paddington smiled happily.

119
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,080
Then she remembered her blackened pork pie and frowned.

120
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:31,160
"But, sir - I can't even serve you a proper supper tonight! And there is not enough food in the house to prepare
something else. You must be starving by now!"

121
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,520
He really was starving, but he didn't want to make her feel
any worse than she already felt.

122
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,600
"Tell you what," he said.

123
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:48,000
"Let's go out for a meal. I'm paying for it. After all it was you who shed new light on the Thames Murder Cases, Dr
Watson!"

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,920
Early next morning Inspector Hudson found the autopsy report
on his desk.

125
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:02,240
The medical examiner had thrown in a late night shift because the second murder case would be reported in today's
newspapers and on the local TV stations.

126
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:12,560
The public was already starting to get hysterical about the Thames Murder Cases, and Scotland Yard had to come up with
quick results - or at least with some details for the London public.

127
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:21,720
He opened the report and read that this victim had also been strangled with a belt, or a similar object, as the
strangulation marks on her neck showed.

128
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,000
Then he looked at the photos of the victim.

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Her name was Sue Baker, and she had been a pretty young
woman.

130
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,960
The police had been able to identify her so quickly since
the officers had discovered her handbag under a bush nearby.

131
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Nothing seemed to have been taken from the bag; her passport, her key chain and even her purse with a few bills
and quite a lot of coins were all still there.

132
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,160
She had been a waitress at the "Old Lion's Pub" and had
taken home the tips received that evening.

133
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,200
Since she had lived by herself, no one but her cat had yet
noticed her absence.

134
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:12,560
When the police officers notified her old parents, who lived
in a village close to London, late last night, it was such a shock to her mother that she just kept asking over and over, "What about Lizzy? What about poor Lizzy?" Her husband explained that Lizzy was the name of Sue's cat.

135
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,160
The officers had to drive over to Sue's flat and fetch a
very scared and hungry cat.

136
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,040
After they had dropped the animal off at the parents' home,
Sue's mother seemed to calm down a bit.

137
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,160
These are the tragedies behind the breaking news of a
spectacular crime, Hudson thought.

138
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,480
The personal tragedies usually don't make the news.

139
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,560
However, they do make me care about my cases.

140
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:42,760
He silently vowed to himself that he would find the person who was responsible for the tragedy of Sue Baker's mother -
and Lizzy, the cat.

141
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,600
"Just a moment." The young officer disappeared between the long shelves on which the evidence was kept in sealed
plastic bags.

142
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,320
A minute later he returned with three labelled packages.

143
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,400
"Here you go, sir." He handed the plastic bags over to
Inspector Hudson.

144
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:06,920
Inside were the two dresses the victims had been wearing
last and the belt "Jack the Skipper" had sent with his note.

145
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,760
The beige dress of the first victim clearly matched the belt
the young woman had been strangled with.

146
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,840
The inspector looked at the label inside the dress.

147
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,520
It was a French designer he had never heard of.

148
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,800
Clearly the dress had been expensive.

149
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,080
He took a photograph of the label.

150
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,640
Curiously he turned to the second dress.

151
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,320
This one was of a deep blue.

152
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,400
"Did it come with a belt!" he asked the young officer.

153
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
The officer shook his head.

154
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
"No, sir, no belt came with that piece of evidence."

155
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,640
Hudson glanced at the label.

156
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,480
It was the same French designer.

157
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,080
He whistled through his teeth.

158
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:50,320
"The same type of dress as the first one? That's strange,"
James Hudson murmured in surprise.

159
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,800
"And a waitress in expensive French designer clothes? That's
even stranger..."

160
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,120
"Yes, sir, isn't it?" the young officer agreed.

161
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:10,680
"You'd think they don't earn enough money to make ends meet - and then go out and buy a French dress like that? Oh well,
you never know with women -" But Hudson was no longer listening.

162
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,400
He didn't know very much about women, but he DID know that
the similarity of those two dresses was no coincidence.

163
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
They were a lead.

164
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,840
An important new lead in the Thames Murder Cases.

165
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,960
They tied the two cases together.

166
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,680
They were the connection he had been looking for.

167
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,080
CHAPTER TWO

168
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,280
Two Dresses in a Desert

169
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:40,000
The next person on Hudson's list was Elvira Elliot, his
favourite insurance investigator.

170
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,160
She also happened to be his favourite person; but that was
something he would never admit to himself or anyone else.

171
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,120
"You're lucky," Elvira said as soon as he had identified
himself on the phone.

172
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,520
"I was just leaving my office."

173
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,920
"Then I am lucky indeed," James Hudson said, feeling stupid.

174
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,240
Why did she always make him feel like a clumsy schoolboy?

175
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,360
Perhaps Miss Paddington knew the answer to that question.

176
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,360
But then again - better not ask her.

177
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
She might think all the wrong things.

178
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,760
"Glad you see it that way, too," Elvira said in her sultry
voice.

179
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,480
She sounded amused.

180
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,440
Hudson noticed how hot it was in his office and wiped the
sweat off his forehead.

181
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,080
"Well, I just have a short question," he said a touch too
rudely.

182
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:36,920
"What is it, Inspector?" Whenever she called him by his
title and not by his first name, it put him in a bad mood.

183
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,560
He didn't know why and he didn't care to know why, either.

184
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,120
"Does the name 'Petit Fleur du Jardin' ring a bell?" he
asked.

185
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:59,840
'"Petit fleur du jardin'? Did you just call me Tittle flower of the garden', Inspector? How sweet of you! I didn't know
you could be romantic," Elvira said in that sultry voice of hers.

186
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,360
He just KNEW that she was being sarcastic.

187
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,800
"It's a French designer label," he explained, and again he
felt like a fool.

188
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,280
"Ah yes, now I remember," Elvira replied.

189
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:29,480
"Yes, that's a very expensive French dressmaker. You only get those dresses at 'Gray's'. I think they sell the whole
summer collection there. I simply MUST get myself one soon! Should I get one in peach or in navy blue - what do you think, James?"

190
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,960
"Don't ask me," he said.

191
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,360
Elvira would look good in any colour of the rainbow, he
thought.

192
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,440
At least this time she had not called him by his title...

193
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,120
"Thanks for your help," he said gruffly.

194
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,920
"Any time, sir," she replied and hung up.

195
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,800
When Mrs Baker opened the door to let the Scotland Yard
inspector in, she began to cry.

196
00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:02,760
"Poor Lizzy", she sobbed, "she hasn't been eating anything! It's not very nice of Sue to leave her cat alone for so
long, is it?"

197
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:10,800
"She's still not quite herself," Mr Baker explained to
Hudson, while he ushered the inspector into the living room.

198
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Hudson sat down on an overstuffed sofa.

199
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,440
Its cover was a mixed array of pink roses, white lilies and
green ferns.

200
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,680
Little flowers in a garden... it reminded him of the first
question he had to ask the grieving parents.

201
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,840
"I'm sorry to bother you," he said.

202
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,800
"But I need to ask you if Sue recently bought a blue French
designer dress."

203
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,360
Mr Baker shook his head, and his wife burst out in tears
again.

204
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,200
"A French dress? Aren't they expensive? I don't think so,"
the father said.

205
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
"We raised our girl to be modest."

206
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:58,480
"She always bought cat food with the tips she got from the
guests over at the pub," his wife sobbed.

207
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,360
"She took such good care of Lizzy. That's why I can't
understand why she hasn't come back for her cat yet..."

208
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,520
"Did Sue have a boyfriend? Was she seeing anyone?" the
inspector continued.

209
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,920
"No," her father replied.

210
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:29,480
"As far as we know, she only had a few girlfriends. Sometimes they would go out for a meal or a film. Sue didn't
have any time for a man - she had to work most evenings anyway."

211
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,760
"Could she have met a man at the 'Old Lion's Pub'?" Hudson
wanted to know.

212
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,080
"Someone who might have bought her a blue French designer
dress?"

213
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,520
Again Mr Baker shook his head.

214
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,720
"I think she would have told us," he said sadly.

215
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,760
"But she did not mention any special man in her life."

216
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,200
"She was such a pretty girl," his wife sobbed.

217
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:08,880
"And she loved pretty clothes. But she didn't have the money for expensive dresses. She was saving most of her money for
veterinary school. You see, she wanted to become a veterinarian because she loved animals so much."

218
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,480
Sue's father nodded proudly.

219
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:19,800
"Yes, my little girl would have made a fine veterinarian."
His voice broke.

220
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:31,680
Sue's mother shook her head and mumbled, "But now I'm no longer sure about that. Why did she leave her poor cat
alone? That's not very nice of her, is it?"

221
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,400
The inspector rose.

222
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,600
He did not want to bother the grieving parents any more for
the time being.

223
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,480
"Thank you so much," he said.

224
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,200
"I'll do everything to find the person who did this to your
daughter. I promise."

225
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,680
The first victim's name was Melanie Jordan.

226
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,120
She had been a 28-year-old secretary.

227
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,000
On the night she was murdered she had gone out with an old
school friend.

228
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,920
They had spent a pleasant but unspectacular evening in the city, and shortly after twelve she had said goodbye to her
friend.

229
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:13,080
The next morning a dock worker had found her on the banks of
the River Thames - strangled and wearing that beige dress.

230
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Of course Hudson's colleagues had already interviewed her
family, friends and co-workers.

231
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,920
But there was a new question they had not asked yet simply
because it had not come up before.

232
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,440
He made a few phone calls.

233
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,640
"Did Melanie recently buy a beige French designer dress?" he
asked one witness after another.

234
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,320
"Not that I know of," her best friend said.

235
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,760
"She couldn't afford expensive clothes," her mother said.

236
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,200
"She didn't wear a beige dress that night," her old school
friend said.

237
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:59,680
"Let me see - oh yes, she was dressed in jeans and a red cotton top. She had taken along a jacket, but she didn't put
it on because the evening was so mild."

238
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,080
Looks like the man who killed the two women is also the man
who bought those two dresses, Hudson thought.

239
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,080
The same man who sent us the belt and calls himself "Jack
the Skipper".

240
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,400
Again he wondered if there would be another note soon.

241
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,280
And another murder after that.

242
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,840
On the outside "Gray's" was an unspectacular building in one
of the narrow side streets found in West End.

243
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,800
It had a fresh white coat of paint.

244
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,960
The window frames and the beautiful old wooden door were
painted blue.

245
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:38,920
Only a small brass sign over the heavy door which read "Gray's Boutique" told the inspector that he was entering
the right shop.

246
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,120
He stepped into another world.

247
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,280
The high walls and the ceiling were as blue as the sky.

248
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,800
The far wall was decorated with some abstract paintings.

249
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,360
The floor was covered with white sand.

250
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,760
There were three tall potted palm-trees in different
corners.

251
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:03,520
Dresses, skirts, blouses, trousers and jackets were arranged on hangers that hung from thick white ropes along the other
three walls.

252
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,080
A sandy-coloured wooden booth in the form of a pyramid was
in the centre of the large sales room.

253
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,440
Its shelves were filled with jumpers, T-shirts and
accessories.

254
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,280
An old brass cash register was sitting on a small wooden
table in front of the pyramid.

255
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,600
Exotic music was coming from somewhere.

256
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,800
Hudson looked round but he could not see any speakers.

257
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,120
The music seemed to be coming from behind the potted palms.

258
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,680
A woman left the row of colourful blouses she had been
admiring.

259
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:43,320
"Don't you just love their desert theme?" she asked while
passing him to look at the next row of colourful blouses.

260
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,640
"What? Oh yes, certainly," he said.

261
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,760
"It's rather - creative!"

262
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,520
The only thing that's missing is a camel, he thought to
himself.

263
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,960
A young shop assistant dressed in white shorts, a white top
and white sandals came up to him.

264
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,640
"May I help you, sir?" she asked.

265
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,760
"Is there anything particular you're looking for?"

266
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,440
"No - I mean, yes - I'm looking for the manager." He showed
her his badge.

267
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,080
"Inspector James Hudson from Scotland Yard."

268
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,280
"Scotland Yard?" the young assistant asked shocked.

269
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,840
"Why - what's wrong?"

270
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,960
"Would you please just get the shop manager?" Hudson said
patiently.

271
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,880
"Oh yes, of course, sir." The flustered girl ran off.

272
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,560
The woman who had been inspecting her third row of blouses
turned round.

273
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,600
Still holding up a very pink blouse, she glanced at the
inspector.

274
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:50,480
"The Yard here at 'Gray's'? What are you looking for - an
illegally imported camel?"

275
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
"Not really." Hudson shook his head.

276
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,280
"But if I were you, I would stay away from that pink!"

277
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,680
Without so much as another glance she marched off to a row
of pastel ensembles.

278
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,200
Half a minute later the flustered shop assistant returned
with the flustered shop manager.

279
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,160
"Emily Gray," she introduced herself nervously.

280
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,640
"I'm the owner of the shop. How may I help you?"

281
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,800
"I need to ask you some questions in reference to an
investigation," Hudson explained.

282
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:32,800
"Is there a room where we could talk privately?" "Oh, of course! Please come along this way." Ms Gray led the
inspector into her office and offered him a seat.

283
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Then she sat down and brushed back her long black hair.

284
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,600
"So what brings you here?" she asked businesslike.

285
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,320
"Surely not our unique desert theme?"

286
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,080
The inspector studied her for a second.

287
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,160
She was a good-looking woman about forty, even though her
features were a bit hard.

288
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,520
But then it probably was hard work to keep a trendy boutique
like this one successful year after year.

289
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:11,640
Aloud he said, "No, of course not - although it certainly is impressive! But the reason for my stopping by are the two
murder victims we found on the banks of the Thames. I'm sure you've heard about them?"

290
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:20,720
"Oh yes, I read in 'The Times' that they found another poor woman yesterday, didn't they? How horrible!" She shook her
head in disbelief.

291
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,000
"Who would do something like that?"

292
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:36,720
"That's what I'm here to find out. You see, the dresses the two women were wearing when they were found both have the
label 'Petit Fleur du Jardin'. I understand you carry that label in your collection?"

293
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,360
"'Petit Fleur du Jardin'?" Emily Gray asked shocked.

294
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:53,120
"Are you sure? Yes, we carry that label in this year's summer collection. But what does that have to do with she
paused thoughtfully. "Oh my God, of course!

295
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,760
Now I understand. 'Gray's' is the only place in all of
London that sells 'Petit Fleur du Jardin' models!

296
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,080
That's why it's been so successful here.

297
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,520
But the fact that the victims purchased those dresses here
doesn't tell you anything about their murderer yet, does
it?"

298
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,280
Hudson shook his head.

299
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:26,520
"No, that's exactly the point. They did not buy the dresses! These garments are completely unknown to the victims'
families, friends or co-workers! It seems that the murderer has made them put on these dresses shortly before he killed them."

300
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,320
Ms Gray looked aghast.

301
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:46,760
"My dresses? He made them put on my dresses? My beautiful 'Petit Fleur du Jardin' dresses? What a beast! How did he
kill them? The papers didn't say anything about that." Inspector Hudson was not going to say anything about that, either.

302
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,440
The media had not been informed of the note by "Jack the
Skipper" and the enclosed belt.

303
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,720
This was information that only the police knew - and the
culprit himself.

304
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,280
"That's not important now, Ms Gray," he said.

305
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:27,840
"What's important is to know who bought those dresses at your shop. I need you to check your bookkeeping to make sure
that no dresses were stolen. And I will also need two dresses of the exact colours the victims were wearing." Ms Gray said uncertainly, "I'm not sure if my sales personnel will actually remember the customer who bought those dresses. But I certainly can help you out with the sample dresses. What colours are they?"

306
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:56,640
"One is beige, and the other one is a kind of a brilliant dark blue." "Oh yes, I know which ones you are talking
about. The unicoloured V-neck dresses with the ruffled skirt and the slim belt! Those sell really well - why, we must have sold at least ten of each. That's because they are very reasonably priced for one hundred percent of pure silk and such a flattering cut. Let me show you." She rose from her chair and walked to the door.

307
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,160
The inspector followed her back into the sales room, past
the cash register.

308
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,480
The woman who had been so interested in blouses was just
paying for her newest treasure.

309
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,680
Hudson noticed with a quick glance that she had not picked
the pink blouse but one in a greyish green.

310
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,760
She looked up and saw him look at her purchase.

311
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,120
"Very pretty," he nodded grinning.

312
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,680
"It's definitely you!"

313
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,840
"Have you found the camel yet, Inspector?" she replied.

314
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,560
"You may want to check out the dressing cabins!" Grabbing
her shopping bag, she walked out the door.

315
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:41,080
All four shop assistants were completely dressed in white to match the desert theme, but they could not remember a man
buying the dresses in question.

316
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,000
"One or two women were accompanied by their husband or
boyfriend," Mandy said.

317
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,800
"But I can't remember selling those dresses to any male
customer."

318
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:59,880
Jacqueline could not remember whom she had sold any of the dresses to, and Sandy could not even remember selling any
dresses to anyone.

319
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,480
But Bernadine remembered something.

320
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:15,680
"Oh yes, there was this chap who came in a few months ago at the beginning of the summer season. I remember that because
back then we still had these dresses in all colours. We had not sold very many yet."

321
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,680
"Yes, and?" the inspector asked impatiently.

322
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:27,160
"Did he buy one or more dresses? What did he say he wanted
them for? What did he look like?"

323
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Bernadine shook her head.

324
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:52,360
"No, he didn't buy any dress. But he kept going back to the blue ones. It's called Summer Sea. I showed him the dress in
all colours, but he seemed to be particularly interested in the blue one. He even took it outside and held it into the daylight. But then he put it back and said his wife had better try it on first, since she was very particular about colours."

325
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,360
"Did he look at the beige one as well?"

326
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,560
"You mean this one? Sahara Sand?" The girl frowned while she
was trying to remember.

327
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:11,760
"No. Actually he was only interested in the blue one and the green one. That one is called Cool Mint - but he was more
interested in the blue one."

328
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:24,120
"What did he look like? Was he tall or short? Blond or dark? How old would you say he was? Did he wear glasses? How was
he dressed?" the inspector wanted to know.

329
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,960
"He was - I don't know, normal, I guess. I mean he wasn't
particularly good-looking."

330
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,280
"She only notices the good-looking ones," Jacqueline
remarked.

331
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,440
Hudson rolled his eyes.

332
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,680
"Can you remember anything else about that man? Old or
young? Anything?" he asked.

333
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,160
Bernadine was thinking hard.

334
00:30:46,200 --> 00:31:00,800
"He must have been about thirty or thirty-five at the most. Oh yes - he wore glasses with golden frames! And he was kind
of dirty blond. He was neither tall nor short, kind of in between."

335
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,800
"Well, thank you, that's excellent," Hudson said.

336
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,400
"Specially since that chap wasn't good-looking, I mean."

337
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,280
Jacqueline grinned at him, but Bernadine had not noticed his
sarcasm.

338
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,280
She was smiling happily.

339
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,360
CHAPTER THREE

340
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,400
A Dead Rose and Two Artists

341
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,520
At noon the next day Ms Gray called Hudson.

342
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,160
She told him that she had personally checked her records of
the last months.

343
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,560
"Nothing, Inspector," she reported.

344
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,720
"The only thing that is unaccounted for is an old dummy we
don't use any more anyway."

345
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,840
"A dummy?" he asked.

346
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,200
"Who would steal a dummy?"

347
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:54,080
"I have no idea. It had been collecting dust in the storage room, and then one day it was gone. Perhaps it walked off by
itself."

348
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,880
"When did it disappear?" Hudson asked more out of habit than
interest.

349
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:07,520
"Oh, about the time I came down with the flu. Let me see -
that must have been round Easter," the shop owner stated.

350
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:17,960
"Now I compared all sales to our inventory of clothes. Nothing is missing, not one single item that might have been
stolen. All clothes were properly paid for."

351
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,440
"What about cheques and credit cards? How long do you keep
records of those?" Hudson asked.

352
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,800
"Forever," she said.

353
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:35,040
"They're still all there. But do you really think the murderer would have paid for those dresses with a cheque or
credit card?"

354
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,680
"No, I don't," he replied truthfully.

355
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,960
"But we have to investigate every possible lead, you know."

356
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,520
"Yes, I understand that," the boutique owner said.

357
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:55,040
"But this will be handled discreetly, won't it? I don't want the police to upset my customers - it might ruin the good
reputation of my shop!"

358
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,680
"Of course we will be discreet about it," the inspector
assured her.

359
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:12,200
"I will personally see to that. So could you keep all your records handy, so that one of my men can pick them up this
afternoon? You will get everything back as soon as we are finished with it - the two dresses as well."

360
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,120
She promised to have everything ready to be picked up in the
after-noon.

361
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:30,760
Just before she was about to hang up, the inspector said: "Oh, just one more question - who has keys to your shop and
the storage area?" "Only myself. I am always the first person to get there and the last one to leave."

362
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,400
"Sounds just like my job," Hudson remarked.

363
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,120
"Thank you so much. Goodbye."

364
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,760
"Goodbye, Inspector." She hung up.

365
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Well, this is one job I won't handle myself, Hudson thought.

366
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,360
Sorting through bookkeeping records and dealing with figures
is just not my cup of tea!

367
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,400
Let me see - who will be the lucky one to take care of
"Gray's" bookkeeping?

368
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,840
The heatwave had finally cooled off and was replaced by
rain.

369
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,560
The water was pouring down from the sky as if God Himself
was taking a long, refreshing shower.

370
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,680
Hudson drove out of the city centre and past the Updike
Shipyard by the river.

371
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:19,800
He took the shortcut through the industrial area and then some side roads that finally led to the wealthy part of town
where he lived.

372
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:28,560
His house was small but exquisite and surrounded by a large lawn and a rose garden, which was his housekeeper's great
passion.

373
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:36,080
"It's raining cats and dogs!" Miss Paddington said as a sort
of welcome when Hudson opened the front door.

374
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:43,400
"Who are you telling this? I feel like shaking myself like a
wet poodle." He had to sneeze.

375
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,560
Miss Paddington hurried off to the kitchen and returned with
a steaming cup of hot chocolate.

376
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,280
"Here you go. Just what the doctor ordered."

377
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,720
He gratefully drank a few sips.

378
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,600
His housekeeper always seemed to know what he needed at that
moment.

379
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,960
"Thank you," he said.

380
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:11,920
"That's delicious." "It's made with real cocoa and a touch of cinnamon. My Aunt Libby taught me how to make it when I
was a young girl."

381
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,320
"Well, God bless Aunt Libby's soul," the inspector said.

382
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,200
"May she spoil all the angels in heaven with her hot
chocolate!"

383
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,280
"Hope you don't catch a cold, Inspector. But to be honest -
I'm glad we finally get some rain after all that sun."

384
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:35,880
"You're right. I was starting to feel as if I'm in Florida
instead of in good old England!" Hudson said ironically.

385
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:52,120
"That's not what I mean. But the roses did not take very well to all that heat. And they are my first painting
project. I'm working on a still life - a perfect single rose blossom in a glass vase. I'll call it 'Rose in Glass'."

386
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,960
"How fitting," the inspector remarked dryly.

387
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,280
"Yes, isn't it?" she said proudly.

388
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,840
"But before I could finish, all the blossoms died on me
because of the hot weather."

389
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:12,720
"Then why don't you just call the painting 'Dead Rose in
Glass'? Or you could call it 'Rose Dying in Glass'."

390
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,000
Miss Paddington did not like it when the inspector made
jokes like that.

391
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,360
"That's not funny, Inspector. You've had too many death
investigations," she said curtly.

392
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:32,360
"And being all by yourself doesn't help either, you know. Have you seen that nice lady lately? What's her name -
Elvira?"

393
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:39,800
Having made her point, the housekeeper took his empty cup
and left him by himself to think about that nice lady,
Elvira.

394
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,400
Perhaps I should get a cat, he thought.

395
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,080
They are just as complicated as women.

396
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,200
And they have just as long claws.

397
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,840
But you don't have to impress them with compliments.

398
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,720
Inspector Hudson was no longer thinking about cats.

399
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,040
He was thinking about the stranger one of the shop
assistants had mentioned.

400
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,680
How to find the male customer who had shown such interest in
the blue dress?

401
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,880
Well, the only way to do that was through the media.

402
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,600
The shop owner would probably not be too thrilled about
that.

403
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,440
But then it might even boost her business if the dresses
were displayed attractively inside the store.

404
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,520
Oh, so what, he thought.

405
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,160
We will even mention that desert theme.

406
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,520
That should make her happy.

407
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:31,480
The young investigator who had to sort through "Gray's" bookkeeping records confirmed what the boutique owner had
already told Hudson.

408
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,440
Everything was totally correct.

409
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,880
No dress could be missing from the inventory.

410
00:37:35,880 --> 00:38:12,280
"We're still checking into the purchases that were made on credit card or by cheque, sir. So far the customers have
been able to show us what they bought at 'Gray's'. We're only waiting on three more customers who couldn't be reached yet. By the way", the young officer continued, "the woman who found the second victim - her name is Jennifer Clearwater - is among 'Gray's' customers. We are still waiting for the results there, because she and her husband are on holiday right now. But the amount she paid by credit card is less than the price they ask for one of those dresses. So it can't have been a dress she bought. The shop assistants think it was a bikini or something like that."

411
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,400
"So that's not a lead," the inspector said, shaking his
head.

412
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:29,000
"Actually, so far every lead has turned into a dead end. Well, get back to me as soon as you have talked to the
remaining customers. And thank you. You're doing a good job."

413
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,280
The young officer flushed with surprise.

414
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,000
"Why, thank you, sir!" he said and hurried off to do an even
better job.

415
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,480
Why is it so much easier to compliment a subordinate on a job well done than it is to pay a compliment to a beautiful
woman?

416
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,160
The inspector wondered.

417
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,840
"You always call when I'm in a hurry," Elvira said.

418
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,760
"How do you always know when I'm getting ready to leave?"

419
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,960
"I don't," Hudson replied lamely.

420
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:22,840
"Sorry to bother you again so soon. But we're not getting anywhere in the Thames Murder Cases. All we know is that the
murderer must have bought the dresses at Gray's - or somewhere far away in another big city. This 'Petit Fleur du Jardin' stuff is only sold in a few very exclusive shops, as we found out. Therefore I need your help."

421
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,680
He sighed.

422
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,600
He liked to call Elvira, but he hated to have to ask any
favours of her.

423
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,960
She seemed to have heard his sigh, because her voice
softened immediately.

424
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,880
"How can I help you out? I don't know any more about those
dresses than you already do."

425
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:59,120
"But you socialize with the kind of people who buy clothes like that. People who can afford those prices, I mean. We're
probably looking for someone with money - some clown who can go out and buy two very expensive dresses just for the thrill. And the kill, so to speak." "Nice wordplay, James," Elvira said.

426
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,360
"But a sad subject."

427
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,880
"That's how I feel, too. I have to find the bastard before
he strikes again!"

428
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
"What makes you think he will strike again?"

429
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,680
The inspector could not tell her about the pattern he was
beginning to see - the full moon and the same type of dress.

430
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,480
"Let's just call it an instinct. I have a feeling he will
kill again. And soon."

431
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:36,200
"Tell you what. I will see what I can find out. I will ask all my friends in high places a few discreet questions -
without mentioning you, of course. By the way, how did you like the paintings?"

432
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,640
"What paintings?" He had no idea what she was talking about.

433
00:40:41,640 --> 00:41:01,480
"The paintings in 'Gray's' boutique. O.U. Gray's paintings. Didn't you see them? Three of them are hanging on one of the
walls. They bear his artist's initials O.U.G." "O.U. Gray's paintings? Who is O.U. Gray? Ms Gray's husband?" he asked in confusion.

434
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:09,000
"But she said she was divorced." "O.U. Gray is her twin
brother," Elvira explained patiently.

435
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:24,320
"He is a very talented local artist, very 'in' at the moment. Does abstracts. He has developed his own soft,
flowing style. So his pictures always look as if they were taken under water. Some critics already call him a genius."

436
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,440
The inspector, who could not tell the difference between a rose in a glass from an abstract rose under water, was
surprised.

437
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,640
Ms Gray had not mentioned that she had a brother.

438
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,920
So there was another man around who could have somehow taken
those dresses!

439
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,600
"Elvira?"

440
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,400
"What, oh James?" she asked in her sultry voice that made
him want to call her more often.

441
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:57,240
"You know what? You just gave me an important new lead! O.U. Gray! I had no idea about the man! Thank you - thank you so
much!"

442
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,440
"You're quite welcome. But now I've got to run."

443
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,240
She wanted to hang up on him, but he stopped her just in
time.

444
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,600
"One more thing," he said.

445
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,400
"What is it?"

446
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,240
"Tha-that peachy dress you were thinking of buying? I saw it
in the shop," he stuttered.

447
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,320
"And you would look great in it."

448
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,440
"Are you sure now?" she sounded amused.

449
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:34,400
"No, I mean yes - I mean b-beautiful. I really wanted to say that you would look beautiful in that peach-coloured dress.
Like a beautiful peach!'

450
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,720
"You mean like a 'petit peche du jardin'?" she chuckled.

451
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,120
"Well, I didn't mean it as a joke," he said stiffly.

452
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,480
"James, that was the sweetest compliment I ever heard.

453
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,720
No one has ever called me a 'beautiful peach' Now I will
definitely have to buy it.

454
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,840
It's all your fault if I spend half of my monthly income on
that peachy dress!

455
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
Have a nice day!"

456
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,920
They rang off.

457
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,760
He had done it.

458
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,840
He had paid her the sweetest compliment she had ever heard.

459
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,120
James Hudson leaned back in his office chair, doing nothing
but savour the moment.

460
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:24,600
O.U. Gray had the same black hair, blue eyes and features as
his twin sister Emily, but his face was softer and he seemed younger than her.

461
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,800
He was dressed casually in jeans and a black jersey shirt.

462
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Now he is a man that young Bernadine probably considers good
looking, James Hudson thought.

463
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,160
But he doesn't look as if he could run a successful business
the way his sister does.

464
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,160
"Come on in, Inspector." Gray led Hudson into his living
room.

465
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,760
"Do you care for a cup of Orange Pekoe or a glass of
lemonade?" He pointed at a glass jug.

466
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,840
"No, thank you. I won't take up much of your time. I just
have a few questions."

467
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,360
Gray poured himself a glass of freshly made lemonade.

468
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,800
He took a sip of the pale yellow liquid.

469
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,360
"So what brings the famous Scotland Yard Inspector Hudson
here to my modest home?"

470
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:17,400
"I wouldn't exactly call it modest," Hudson replied, looking
round the huge room with the high ceiling.

471
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,120
The walls, the marble floor and the leather furniture were
all white.

472
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,160
A few white decorative vases were placed here and there.

473
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,520
Even the photo books on the coffee table had white covers.

474
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,520
The only splash of colour in the room was a great big rug in
the centre of the room.

475
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,400
All colours of the rainbow were woven into its beautiful
pattern.

476
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:48,000
Pointing at it, the inspector remarked, "That's a nice
piece. It looks like an Indian pattern." "It is," Gray
nodded.

477
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:57,760
"I bought it at an Indian reservation in Arizona. It is
handmade, and the colours are all natural. No chemicals at
all."

478
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,680
"Very beautiful," Hudson commented.

479
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:07,640
"But I don't see any paintings on the walls. I heard you're
an artist who has made quite a name of himself."

480
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,480
Gray put down his glass and smiled.

481
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:26,560
"Who told you that? That's a bit of an exaggeration, I'd say. I'm just using my own watercolour technique, that's
all. And I don't like to display my own art in my own living room. It's like bringing your work home if you know what I mean."

482
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:35,520
Either he really is too modest - or he thinks so highly of himself that he does not want anyone to know what he really
thinks of his own art, Hudson thought.

483
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,200
But the man seemed nice and easygoing enough.

484
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:48,520
"Well, I'm sure you didn't come here to discuss artwork, did
you? So what brought you here, Inspector?"

485
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,280
"I'm investigating into the Thames Murder Cases," Hudson
replied.

486
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:01,120
"I need to ask you what you did three nights ago - Sunday
night between eleven p.m. and three a.m. on Monday morning."

487
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,440
Gray looked genuinely shocked.

488
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:16,160
"That sounds as if - as if you suspect ME of killing those poor women! But that's totally absurd, Inspector! What did I
do to be suspected of such a horrible act?"

489
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,000
"I didn't say we suspect you or anyone else, for that
matter," the inspector said calmly.

490
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,280
"I just have to eliminate all persons who could have anything to do with the two crimes. So what did you do
during the time in question?"

491
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,440
Frowning, Gray stared at the white ceiling.

492
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,560
"Let me see," he said thoughtfully.

493
00:46:37,560 --> 00:47:07,840
"When did you say it was - Sunday night? What did I do that night? Oh yes - it was really hot that day, and so I spent
the whole day by the pool at my sister's house. After supper I went home. That was about ten o'clock. Then I worked a bit on a painting and watched a late film on television. An American film; it was called 'The Magic Touch'. After that I went to sleep. That was about 3:30 a.m."

494
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,720
"So you were by yourself? Or can anyone verify what you just
told me?"

495
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,240
Gray shook his head.

496
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:24,960
"No, I'm afraid not. I was by myself. But that's absurd, Inspector! I can tell you what happened in the film "That
won't do.

497
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,680
You could have taped it on a video recorder and watched it
later, you see?

498
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,320
That's not an alibi."

499
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,240
Gray jumped up and walked over to the window.

500
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,760
He was clearly irritated and upset.

501
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,280
"I have nothing to do with those horrible murders!" he
exclaimed.

502
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:53,800
"Had I known that some woman would get killed Sunday night and that I would be suspected, I would have made sure to get
myself a watertight alibi!" He stared out of the window and suddenly turned round.

503
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:17,240
"But wait - my neighbour! She may have seen me paint in my studio! Ask her if she saw me through the curtains. And I
always listen to pop music while I paint. Sunday night I put on some music. I kept the window open, because it was still so hot in the flat. I believe she also kept her window open, so she may have seen me paint and heard me sing along to the music."

504
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,880
The inspector got up.

505
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,360
"Yes, I'll do that. She may be your alibi. Say, do you have
any keys to your sister's boutique?"

506
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:40,680
"No, sir. Why should she give me a spare key? I have nothing to do with her business. Unfortunately I'm not good with
money and figures. I never developed the left side of my brain, I guess." He smiled and shrugged.

507
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:54,080
"My mother always wanted me to become a businessman. Now I paint abstract watercolours. Oh well, you can't please them
all, can you?" "No, you can't," the inspector said.

508
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,880
"Well, thank you so much for your time, Mr Gray. We'll see
what your neighbour has to say. What's her name?"

509
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:10,360
"Mrs Kennedy, I believe. I don't know her very well; we just
say hello when we meet downstairs. She is an old lady living by herself."

510
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,200
The old lady did remember seeing Gray through the white
cotton curtains of his window.

511
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:55,920
"Yes, sir, he was sitting there painting all right when I was watering my balcony flowers before going to bed at half
past eleven. In that heat you have to water them twice a day, you know? And the young gentleman over there was concentrating on his painting, singing. Mind you, he wasn't being loud, he has very good manners. You could barely hear him. He's really well-educated. And in addition, he is good-looking, too. I wonder why he hasn't married by now. Of course most young women have a job these days, but that isn't what they're really after, is it? I think they still want to get married, deep down in their hearts, I mean..."

512
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,480
Inspector Hudson hastily thanked her and fled the scene.

513
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:08,160
The final results of the check-up on "Gray's" customers who had paid by cheque or credit card did not offer any new
clues, either.

514
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,280
All the purchases of dresses, blouses, skirts and bikinis
matched up.

515
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,480
"I couldn't find anything that looks suspicious, sir," the
young investigator reported to Hudson.

516
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:35,880
"Only two women bought one of those blue dresses on credit card - and both still have their dress and the belt that
comes with it, as they showed me. One woman bought a beige dress and paid with a cheque. But she still has the complete garment as well, and she just bought it two weeks ago."

517
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,960
"Then that was after the first murder," the inspector
murmured and shook his head.

518
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,360
"This is leading us nowhere. But thank you anyhow."

519
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:57,400
Thursday morning the "London Times" ran a short article on the male customer who had shown such interest in the blue
"Petit Fleur du Jardin" dress a few months before.

520
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:04,880
The article only said that he may be an important witness to the two crimes and should report to Scotland Yard
immediately.

521
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,400
The paper also printed two pictures.

522
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:15,520
One displayed the blue dress on a hanger next to one of the potted palm-trees; the other one showed the sales room,
pyramid and all.

523
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:23,120
"The reporter even mentioned our desert theme," Ms Gray said
happily when she called the inspector in the afternoon.

524
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:36,240
"Our sales have doubled since this morning! Now everyone is keen on buying 'Petit Fleur du Jardin' dresses - specially
the blue ones. Thank you for making sure that the press presented 'Gray's' so nicely!"

525
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,040
But the man with the special interest in the "Summer Sea"
model did not step forward.

526
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,560
Perhaps he was on holiday.

527
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,880
Perhaps he did not read the papers.

528
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,640
Or perhaps he was the murderer.

529
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,880
CHAPTER FOUR

530
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,160
Inspector Hudson Receives a Letter

531
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:05,280
Then Sue Baker's father called to report that his wife had remembered something about a "secret admirer" their daughter
had mentioned to her.

532
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,360
"A secret admirer?" Hudson asked.

533
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:22,560
"Yes, sir. My wife is feeling a bit better - of course she isn't over the loss of our daughter yet. But at least she
can now accept the fact that Sue is gone," Mr Baker said.

534
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:29,920
"And she just remembered that Sue had said something about a
man showing a lot of interest in her."

535
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,280
The inspector was all ears.

536
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,400
"Did she say who he was? Did she give a name?"

537
00:52:36,400 --> 00:53:03,840
"No, she just said that he was in a difficult position and did not want her to talk about him. She shouldn't tell
anyone before he had sorted out his problems. My wife got the impression that he might be married. Sue only mentioned him because her mother found a pearl necklace in her room while cleaning it. So she asked Sue where she got those pearls, and after a bit of questioning Sue told her."

538
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:12,320
"Can your wife remember anything else Sue might have mentioned? Like where she met this man, how long she had
known him, things like that?"

539
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,280
Hudson heard Sue's father sigh sadly.

540
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:26,840
"No, Inspector. Believe me, I would tell you if I knew. The murderer of my daughter must be punished for what he did to
her!"

541
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,720
"Yes, sir," Hudson said with great respect for the grieving
father.

542
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,000
"I feel the same way."

543
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,920
None of Sue's girlfriends knew anything about a secret
admirer.

544
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,680
Neither did the two other waitresses at the "Old Lion's
Pub".

545
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:49,200
"A secret admirer who gave her real pearls? How thrilling!"
the waitress from Jamaica said.

546
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:58,920
"I wish I had a secret admirer like that, too! Then I'd quit
this place in no time! Would you like a glass of 'Pale Ale'? It's our special brand."

547
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,840
The inspector shook his head.

548
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,720
"Thank you, but I never drink alcohol while I'm working."

549
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,040
The pretty waitress glanced at Hudson.

550
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:12,440
"What about after you're done working?" she asked sweetly.

551
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,720
"It's on the house."

552
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,560
Smiling, Hudson had to decline her offer.

553
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,920
The other waitress, who was from Newcastle and had to work
on her day off to replace Sue, shrugged.

554
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:31,200
"If I were you, I'd ask Paul about that secret admirer
stuff," she said in a tired voice.

555
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:44,160
"He was keen on her, and he happens to be married. Aren't all secret admirers simply married chaps? Plus he's making a
lot of money from this place - not that we see a lot of it, though."

556
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,760
"So Paul is the owner of this pub?" James Hudson inquired.

557
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,640
He looked appraisingly at the noble wooden floor and wall
panelling.

558
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,760
It looked like real cherry wood.

559
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:01,400
"Yes, Inspector. You can find him in his office. It's right
back there, next to the kitchen."

560
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,200
The man who opened the door to his office looked distressed.

561
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,520
"Yes?" he asked.

562
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,680
Inspector Hudson introduced himself and flashed his badge.

563
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,960
"Are you the owner of this pub?" he asked.

564
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,400
"Yes, so what!"

565
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,200
"I understand Sue Baker worked here," Hudson said.

566
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,800
"Therefore I must ask you a few questions."

567
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,480
Paul Wynfield frowned.

568
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,960
He was about thirty-five and had blue eyes and thick brown
hair.

569
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,280
He had rough features and a tiger's head tattooed on his
upper arm.

570
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,200
Bernadine would probably have found him a "good-looking
boxer sort of chap", James thought.

571
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:57,600
"But your men were already here on Monday, asking all kinds of questions! So why are you snooping round here now as
well? Didn't I read in the papers about you? Aren't you the chap the Yard always puts in charge when a case is hopeless?"

572
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,320
"If you want to put it that way - then I'm the one," Hudson
replied calmly.

573
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:11,040
"So why aren't you out there finding the one who did that to
Sue?" Paul Wynfield asked outraged.

574
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,440
"That's exactly what I'm doing, sir," Hudson said.

575
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:29,120
"I need to ask you if you might have given her a pearl necklace. Some man she called her 'secret admirer ' gave her
said necklace, and it was more than likely a married man with a high income - like yourself."

576
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,880
Wynfield pushed his chair back and rose.

577
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:40,040
"What is this - an interrogation? Are you suspecting me of
having killed poor Sue? Me?!"

578
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:46,240
With a few quick strides he walked over to the small window
and turned his back on the inspector.

579
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:58,720
"Why on earth should I go and kill Sue? I liked her! Everyone liked her! She couldn't hurt a fly! Why would
anybody do something like this to her?"

580
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,080
His voice broke.

581
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,680
To the inspector's surprise the tall man with the broad
shoulders started to cry.

582
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:26,120
His back still turned on Hudson, he sobbed, "Sue and I - I mean, there was nothing between us - I have a wife and
children, you know. But I really liked her a lot - well, yes, I did give her those pearls. I would have liked to give her a lot more, but, oh well.

583
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:37,760
He got a hold on himself, wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and turned round. "Inspector", he said pleadingly,
"you must believe me!

584
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,160
I could never have killed her."

585
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,520
"I want to believe you," Hudson responded.

586
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:51,640
Even though the man had known Sue and might have had a motive to kill her, that still did not explain the murder of
the first victim.

587
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,080
Unless he happened to have known her, too.

588
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,840
But still Hudson had to check if Paul Wynfield had an alibi.

589
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,000
It was simple police procedure.

590
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:10,840
"Just tell me where you were last Sunday night between eleven and three o'clock the following morning. Just so we
can eliminate you as a possible suspect."

591
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,120
"At home. Ask my wife," the pub owner answered.

592
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:22,160
"I closed up here and left about eleven fifteen, as usual.
Then I drove straight home."

593
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,000
"When did you get home?"

594
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,200
"About half an hour later. Driving home takes about that
long."

595
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,840
"And your wife was home? Can she confirm that you arrived
home round quarter to twelve?"

596
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,480
Wynfield nodded.

597
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,360
"Of course she can confirm that. She was still awake when I
got home."

598
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,400
Not the best of alibis, the inspector thought.

599
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,440
A wife can confirm anything if she does not want to send her
husband off to prison.

600
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:55,520
Moreover, if the pub owner had been quick, he could have
given Sue a lift and strangled her inside his car.

601
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,720
Then he could have dressed and dumped her body by the river,
which was only a few minutes' drive away from the pub.

602
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,760
He would still have made it home without losing enough time
for anyone to notice.

603
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:14,600
"Can anyone else confirm your times? Did anyone see you
leave the pub or arrive home? Any neighbours?"

604
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,640
Wynfield frowned and shook his head.

605
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:23,000
"No, not that I remember." Hudson thanked him and left.

606
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,960
He was lost in thoughts.

607
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,960
The man did not have much of an alibi, but he also did not
have much of a motive.

608
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:37,000
Also, there did not seem to by any connection between him
and the first woman who had got killed over five weeks ago.

609
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:45,800
"So, Inspector - did you find the secret admirer you were looking for?" the waitress from Newcastle called after him
on his way out.

610
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:51,240
When he turned round, she was wiping down a table, smiling
knowingly at him.

611
00:59:51,360 --> 01:00:02,800
Of course Mrs Wynfield was able to confirm that her husband had come home about eleven forty-five on Sunday night and
had not left the house until the next morning at seven.

612
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,920
"What's all this about, anyhow?" she asked upset.

613
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,880
"Why should he have anything to do with the murder of one of
his waitresses?"

614
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,400
"Just a routine check, Madam," the inspector answered
discreetly.

615
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,720
After all he did not want to be responsible for the break-up
of a marriage.

616
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:28,400
Friday afternoon the mysterious stranger who had been so
interested in the blue dress rang up Scotland Yard.

617
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,440
The call was transferred over to Hudson's line.

618
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:43,280
After Hudson had taken down the caller's name and address, he asked the man, "So you are the male customer who was
looking at the blue dresses at 'Gray's Boutique' a few months ago?"

619
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,760
"Yes, I think so," the man, whose name was Mr Graham, said
nervously.

620
01:00:48,800 --> 01:01:12,920
"Even though I have no idea what this is all about. But I did go to 'Gray's' a few months ago to find something for my
wife's birthday. And I saw a blue dress I thought she might like. But she is very particular about colours, and so I ended up putting it back. I'm glad I did! She just bought herself an olive blouse at 'Gray's'. I never would have picked that colour for her, but that's my wife!"

621
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,640
"An olive blouse?" the inspector asked.

622
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:23,520
He dimly remembered the woman who had been looking at the rows of blouses when he had stopped by "Gray's" early this
week.

623
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:28,480
"Yes. She calls it olive, but I would say it's a sickly
greenish grey."

624
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,000
"I may have met your wife when I was at the boutique this
week," Hudson said astonished.

625
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:50,400
"That's possible, sir. Usually she ends up buying pink stuff, but when she came home from her last shopping tour,
she said one of those blokes from Scotland Yard had walked in. He had had nothing better to do than tell her not to buy that pink blouse she had picked out."

626
01:01:50,400 --> 01:02:02,200
Flustered, Hudson apologized, "I'm sorry if I have offended your wife, Mr Graham. I just thought that pink was a touch
too pink. But of course it was none of my business."

627
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,320
"Well, I'm glad you told her, Inspector!" Graham replied.

628
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:17,600
"She actually looks surprisingly good in that olive blouse and is very pleased with it. She said that inspector from
Scotland Yard may have been rude, but that he had a good eye for colours!"

629
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,760
The letter arrived on Saturday.

630
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,960
It was addressed to "Scotland Yard, London".

631
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,480
There was neither a street address nor a postal code on the
envelope.

632
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:35,320
Hudson's home phone rang the minute he was starting on the breakfast Miss Paddington had prepared for him after letting
him sleep in.

633
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,360
The Yard called him in to take a look at the package bearing
"Jack the Skipper's" handwriting.

634
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:50,360
He glanced at the tempting scrambled eggs with fried sausages and tomatoes, the steaming toast and the fresh
biscuits and sighed.

635
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,080
Then he hurried over to his office.

636
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,680
The envelope was already waiting for him on his desk.

637
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,720
The inspector took one look at the small package and knew
what was inside.

638
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,000
The printed letters and the incomplete address told him
enough.

639
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,720
"The arrogance," he murmured while opening it carefully.

640
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:35,480
"The arrogance of not bothering to even write a full address! He considers himself to be too important for that.
He knows we were waiting for his second letter and expects us to recognize it immediately cautiously he took out a folded sheet with the help of tweezers, and we do! We do exactly what he expects us to do."

641
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:48,720
Scotland Yard had indeed been waiting for a second note from "Jack the Skipper", and the secretary who handled all
incoming letters had been alerted to be on the lookout for an envelope just like this one.

642
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,880
So she had sent it on to Inspector Hudson before even
opening it.

643
01:03:52,920 --> 01:04:24,120
He unfolded the piece of paper and read the printed text: "Hello, Inspector Hudson! I heard they put you in charge of
my case. If you really are as competent as they say, then why haven't you knocked on my door yet? The second lamb choked on this blue belt (just check the marks on her pretty neck if you don't believe me!). The next little lamb won't die in colour - but rather in a bad mood... Love and Kisses, Jack the Skipper."

644
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,960
Sure enough the blue belt that matched the second victim's
dress was in the envelope as well.

645
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,200
The inspector did not touch it.

646
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,800
The crime scene experts had to examine it for traces first.

647
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:43,240
If they were lucky, they might get the murderer's fingerprint or some traces from the clothes he had been
wearing that night.

648
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,480
Hudson put down the letter and stared at it.

649
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,080
How did "Jack the Skipper" know who had been assigned to the
case?

650
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,600
That fact had not yet been made public.

651
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,280
The public did not know.

652
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,680
But the murderer did.

653
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,440
So what did that mean?

654
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:11,640
It could only mean one thing: "Jack the Skipper" was either one of the men Hudson had already interviewed, or he had
been told by someone that the famous inspector was going round, asking a lot of questions.

655
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,880
CHAPTER FIVE

656
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,680
Tomatoes and Other Clues

657
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:26,800
Unfortunately, like the first note and belt, the second note
and the blue belt offered no fingerprints.

658
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:35,920
Of course there was plenty of trace evidence on the belt - tiny bits of dirt, plants and sand, traces that matched
those found on the dresses.

659
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,760
This was to be expected, since the victim had been found
outside on the ground.

660
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,160
Two single hairs were found on the belt, but they only
matched the victim's own long dark hair.

661
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,640
The inspector was interested in a tiny fibre, however.

662
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,080
He whistled to himself.

663
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,960
It was a dark blue cotton-polyester blend and most likely
came from a T-shirt.

664
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,360
Identical fibres had been found on both dresses.

665
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,360
So the sender of the belt had to have been at both crime
scenes.

666
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,800
Well, that's a start, he thought.

667
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:12,560
If we find the T-shirt that matches that fibre, then we may
have a piece of evidence that will hold up in court.

668
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,840
But first he had to find the person who had been wearing
that blue T-shirt.

669
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:23,560
Inspector Hudson decided to take a closer look at the only
two possible suspects he had so far.

670
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:29,160
Both had an alibi, even though Wynfield's was shaky, yet it
still was an alibi.

671
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:38,920
But Hudson was pressed for time because "Jack the Skipper" had already mentioned a third victim who "won't die in
colour - but rather in a bad mood".

672
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,520
What on earth did he mean by that?

673
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,680
And why did he write "in colour"?

674
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,000
Did he mean the colour of the dresses he had made them wear?

675
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,480
Even though Mrs Graham thought Hudson to have an eye for
colours, he did not think of beige as being a real colour.

676
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,560
Monday morning Hudson would have his men check into O.U.

677
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,560
Gray's background, and into Paul Wynfield's as well.

678
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:06,200
If it was true that the murderer always struck during full
moon, then James

679
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,080
Hudson had three more weeks to find him.

680
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,280
But for now there wasn't much he could do over the weekend.

681
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,280
He wondered if Miss Paddington could warm up that delicious
breakfast he had abandoned over an hour ago.

682
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,160
"Of course I can," she said when he got home.

683
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:28,320
"I'll warm up the biscuits and scramble some fresh eggs for
you. But then I'll have to hurry off to my painting class."

684
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,160
The inspector followed her into the kitchen.

685
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,040
"Still the 'Rose in Glass'?" he asked.

686
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,160
"Or did you have to bury that project?"

687
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:54,400
Scrambling up two eggs, she said, "The poor rose died on me.
But it was too difficult for a first still life, anyhow. Now I'm painting tomatoes instead. They're red and round and rather easy to paint. I'll call the painting 'Tomatoes in Bowl'"

688
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,000
"Sounds tasty." the inspector commented dryly.

689
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,440
The background checks took several days.

690
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,520
The first piece of infor-mation about O.U.

691
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,960
Gray's background came unofficially - and from Elvira
Elliot.

692
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:17,760
"O.U. Gray is the grandson of James Updike, the founder of
the Updike Shipyard," she reported to Hudson.

693
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:41,640
"His full name is Oscar Updike Gray. That's because his mother's last name is his middle name. It is said in certain
circles that he was supposed to take over the Updike family business, but that he just couldn't manage that. Apparently that was a great disappointment to his grandfather and his mother. His mother doesn't think much of his art, but she is very proud of his twin sister's successful business."

694
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:48,880
"The Updike Shipyard, you said? That's very interesting,"
Hudson said, whistling through his teeth.

695
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:57,960
"And you found out all that in such short time? So when are you going to join us here at the Yard? We could use an
investigative talent like yours!"

696
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,280
"Never," Elvira answered.

697
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,880
But she was smiling.

698
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,440
He could hear her smile on the telephone right before she
rang off.

699
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,280
So O.U.

700
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,880
Gray was connected to a shipyard.

701
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,120
Could that be the meaning of "Skipper"?

702
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:17,960
But he had not become a skipper - to the great
disappointment of his grandfather and his mother.

703
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,880
Did killing make him feel like less of a disappointment?

704
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,800
Like a winner?

705
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,520
As if he was in control of his life?

706
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,280
As if he was the skipper his family had wanted him to
become?

707
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:33,880
James Hudson had to wait on the results of the two
background checks.

708
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:41,640
Two of his character features that made him such a valuable member of Scotland Yard were his thoroughness and his
impatience.

709
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,240
He simply did not like to sit and wait.

710
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,960
So he decided to find out more about the first victim's
past.

711
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,400
Could there be any connection between the two victims after
all?

712
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,000
He rang up Melinda Jordan's former colleagues and friends.

713
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,920
He asked a lot of questions about her habits, interests and
activities.

714
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,480
She had liked the cinema, musicals and reading books.

715
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:08,800
She had loved to travel - mostly to Italy and Spain for her
summer holidays.

716
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,200
She had enjoyed cooking pasta and dancing salsa.

717
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,480
Really nothing out of the ordinary.

718
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,800
But then he struck gold.

719
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:24,040
About six years ago Melanie Jordan had worked at the "Pale
Ale Brewery", a small brewery in the South of London.

720
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,640
She had been in charge of the customers' orders.

721
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,440
She had quit that job when a larger firm had made her a
better-paying job offer as a secretary.

722
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:39,080
But for two years Melanie had handled all orders - including
those of the "Old Lion's Pub".

723
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,480
When Paul Wynfield was shown photos of Melanie Jordan, he
denied having known her.

724
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:50,840
He said over and over again that he always ordered his
barrels of "Pale Ale" over the telephone.

725
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,480
But his waitress from Newcastle told a different story.

726
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:14,360
"That's not true, but don't tell him I said so, Inspector. I've been working here for ten years - too long, if you ask
me. And Paul used to go everywhere in person. Now he's getting lazy, but a few years ago he didn't believe in making phone calls. 'I get the best results if I deal with people directly,' he would always say."

727
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,040
Melanie's former colleagues confirmed what the waitress had
said.

728
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:26,200
It used to be Wynfield's habit to come into their office, chat a little with everyone - specially the ladies - and
order five or six barrels of ale.

729
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:34,640
"How well did he know Melanie Jordan?" Inspector Hudson asked the clerk who had had her desk right across from
Melanie's desk.

730
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,080
The woman shrugged.

731
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,040
"I couldn't tell you that," she said.

732
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:54,880
"I mean Melanie and I weren't close friends or anything like that. When Paul came over, he talked to me and flirted with
her. He always paid her a compliment on her dress or her hair or the way she smiled. But I don't know if they ever went out on a date."

733
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,720
The background check on Wynfield revealed that he had been
married for twelve years.

734
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,040
So he had already been married at the time Melanie Jordan
had been working for "Pale Ale".

735
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:17,440
But the inspector was more interested in another detail about the pub owner's past: Before Wynfield had opened his
pub, he had had several different jobs, including working as a cook on a ship.

736
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,000
"Uh oh - so he was a sailor," Hudson murmured, whistling
through his teeth.

737
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:28,520
"It doesn't look too good for you, Paul. Could you be our
'Skipper' after all?"

738
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:35,000
O.U. Gray's past, however, only revealed that he was
regularly suffering from bouts of depression.

739
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,960
There had been a few times when he had got so depressed that
he had had to be hospitalized for a few weeks.

740
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,840
Funny - the man seemed so relaxed and easygoing, Hudson
thought.

741
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,400
Could he be hiding a different personality behind his
friendly exterior?

742
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,400
The person who could answer that question best was Miss
Paddington.

743
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,920
You could not hide anything from her.

744
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,040
He decided to take her to "Gray's Boutique" soon to have a
look at O. U. G.'s paintings.

745
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:09,800
But a depression does not make a murderer yet, and Paul Wynfield had just become Suspect Number One on the
inspector's list.

746
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,440
Here was a former connection to a ship, and he had lied
about the fact that he had personally known the first
victim.

747
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:24,640
When the owner of the "Old Lion's Pub" was confronted with the statements made by Melanie's former colleague, he broke
down and confessed.

748
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,640
"Yes, yes, I did know her," he confessed.

749
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:35,600
"She used to work at the brewery some years ago. But that
doesn't mean that I killed her, does it, Inspector?"

750
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,640
"Then why did you lie to me?" Hudson asked.

751
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,760
"Now things look even worse for you."

752
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,000
Wynfield averted his eyes.

753
01:13:45,000 --> 01:14:00,920
"I don't know. I read about Melanie's murder in the papers and was shocked. Then - four weeks later - my own waitress
is strangled the same way Melanie was. It's a coincidence, but it makes me look as if I killed them both."

754
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:07,000
Wynfield gave the same alibi for the night Melanie Jordan
was killed - that he had been home with his wife.

755
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,800
Of course she confirmed his alibi again.

756
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,040
A search warrant of Wynfield's home did not shed any new
light on the matter.

757
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,040
No dark blue T-shirt was found that might have matched the
fibres on the victims' clothes.

758
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,080
No receipts from "Gray's" for any dresses bought there.

759
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:28,800
It could be a mere coincidence that Wynfield had known both
women personally and that he had been a sailor in the past.

760
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,400
It looked suspicious but it was not enough to charge him
with murder.

761
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:38,880
All Hudson could do was tell Paul Wynfield not to leave the
City of London.

762
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,720
And wait for the next murder to happen.

763
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:49,040
Miss Paddington liked the idea of being hired as a police
psychologist - even if it was just for a day.

764
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:54,120
"But of course I'll go there with you and take a look at the
paintings," she declared.

765
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:59,160
She was sitting on the terrace; her painting utensils were
scattered everywhere.

766
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,600
"Let me just clean up here first."

767
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,440
For the next five minutes she was busy putting away her
paints and brushes.

768
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:15,680
When she picked up a white canvas with nothing but two red dots on it, the inspector asked curiously, "Are those two
red dots the 'Tomatoes in Bowl'?''

769
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,680
"Well, I'm not finished yet.

770
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:25,720
I just started on my first still life", she said a bit
offended, adding, "and anyhow - they are not red.

771
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,400
That colour is called 'vermilion'."

772
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,120
"They look nice," James Hudson said hastily.

773
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,960
"They have a very pretty colour. Actually they look very
juicy."

774
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,280
"You think so?" the housekeeper asked happily.

775
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,640
"I'll put them into an ultramarine bowl. That's 'blue' for
laymen."

776
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:51,040
"Ultramarine? It sounds like the ocean," Hudson commented.

777
01:15:51,040 --> 01:16:05,080
"It is like the ocean - it is a brilliant sea blue. Look, this is the bowl I will paint." When Miss Paddington brought
him a bowl as blue as the dress the second victim had worn, something clicked in Hudson's mind.

778
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:10,720
"What other names do you professional painters have for
colours?" he wanted to know.

779
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,240
"Well, beige is 'ochre'"

780
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,360
Oh my God, Hudson thought.

781
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:26,120
"O" for ochre and for Oscar - "U" for ultramarine and Updike
- and the "bad mood" for - for Gray!

782
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,000
O.U. Gray.

783
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,120
The colours the victims wore stood for the murderer's
initials!

784
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,640
And he is planning to kill a third woman.

785
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:41,280
I bet she would have worn a grey dress, Hudson thought,
rushing to the phone.

786
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,160
O.U. Gray had played his evil game with Scotland Yard long
enough.

787
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:55,880
He had been laughing to himself, dressing his victims in colours that for him, the artist, spelled out his name and
his mood: a grey mood was a bout of depression.

788
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:03,800
He who had become a painter instead of a "skipper" wanted to
become immortal by killing three women as an "act of art".

789
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:16,200
"Yes, that is likely." Miss Paddington nodded when Hudson told her his theory of the murderer's motive, after he had
telephonically ordered that Gray's flat be searched for certain items.

790
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:23,760
"If he feels like a failure, he will compensate for that by
doing something the world will really notice."

791
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,200
But the inspector had already grabbed his car keys to rush
to his office.

792
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:43,080
In O.U. Gray's flat the officers found not only Gray himself, but also a painter's rag which used to be a dark
blue T-shirt, a tape recorder with his voice singing a pop song and a dummy, wearing a wig with short dark hair.

793
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:48,720
Through the white curtains it looked like the artist himself
was sitting on a chair, painting.

794
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:55,960
When asked, his sister admitted that her brother had managed
the shop for two days in spring, while she had been ill with the flu.

795
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:02,480
That was when he had taken three dresses and rang up the bill, putting the correct amount of money into the cash
register.

796
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,760
When Hudson called Elvira Elliot that evening to tell her
the good news, she was shocked.

797
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:27,200
"O.U. Gray is the Thames Murderer? I can't believe it! A murderer? Why would he go round and kill women? Why, his new
series of three paintings, the 'Moonshine Serenade', was just bought for a lot of money by a New York gallery!"

798
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,760
"The 'Moonshine Serenade'?" the inspector asked.

799
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:39,720
"Yes, the three pictures at 'Gray's Boutique'. That's the
title he gave them. Why do you ask?" Elvira wanted to know.

800
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,200
Now he could tell her.

801
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:50,440
"Because he killed the two women during a full moon. And he announced a third murder - he most likely planned it for the
night of the next full moon."

802
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,960
Elvira's shiver was almost audible.

803
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,720
"Now I don't think I will buy that peachy dress after all,"
she said.

804
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,600
"It would seem like a bad omen."

805
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,000
Hudson had to agree.

806
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,520
"Yes," he said and cleared his throat.

807
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:11,720
"It's a shame, though. I know you would have looked lovely
in that dress - but then you always do, anyway."

808
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:18,960
"Thank you, James," she said gracefully in that sultry voice
of hers.
