00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,720
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,960
A band on a guitar

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,360
Before I was born, my mum 
played music with four friends.  

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,240
There's a photograph of them in our living 
room. Evie, Grace, Angela, Kate and my mum.  

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
They were the Sweet Pepper Band, and they 
played South American music. Mum played guitar.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,440
Mum had long dark hair.  

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,560
In the photograph she's wearing a big hat, a 
red shire and yellow trousers. She looks South  

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,520
American, but she's not, she's English. She's 
smiling in the photograph. She looks beautiful.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,520
She's beautiful now too. But these days 
her hair is short and the dark brown  

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,400
colour comes from a bottle. Mum doesn't 
play her guitar very often any more.  

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
It sits in the corner of the living room waiting 
for Evie, Grace, Angela or Kate to visit.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,600
When I was a little girl, I liked to put my 
small hand on the front of Mums guitar while  

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,400
she played if. My hand moved a little because of 
the music. Mum said that was called vibration.  

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,840
She was happy that I could feel the vibration 
of her music when I put my hand on her guitar.  

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,440
And she wasn't angry when one day I had blue 
paint on my hand and I put it on the guitar.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,760
Mum liked me to feel the vibration of her 
music, you see. That's because I can't hear  

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:32,400
her music. My ears don't work. I'm deaf. 
I was born like that. Sometimes I think  

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
that's why Mum doesn't play music very 
often because she knows I can't hear it.  

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,760
And now that I'm eighteen years old, my hands are 
too big to put them on the front of the guitar.

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,040
I don't know if Mum was sad to have a deaf baby. 
She tells me I was beautiful when I was born.  

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,000
I had lots of blonde hair and blue eyes 
that went brown like hers after a few  

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,080
months. But I don't think Mums sad 
because she smiles all the time.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,440
Mum smiles more than anyone 
I know. She's always happy,  

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,040
that's one of the things everyone loves about 
her. The children at Busy Kids Day Nursery,  

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:16,400
where we both work, all love Mum. Busy Kids is 
Mum's business. She started it five years ago.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,040
Mum's really good with children. I remember when 
I was quite young - five or six years old - I  

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,640
was sad about something. I don't remember what I 
was sad about, but I do remember what Mum said.  

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
We sat in a chair together with her face 
close to mine and she put her arms around me.  

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,880
We stayed like that for a while, and then 
she sat back so she could talk to me.  

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,960
Mum and I use our hands and fingers to 
talk to each other. It's called signing.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,840
Anyway, Mum said that we can choose 
how to be in life - happy or sad.  

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,240
She said, 'Life's short, so choose to be 
happy. I try never to forger those words.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
I try to be like my mum because 
I think she's a wonderful person.  

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,720
I don't know much about my father 
because he left after I was born.  

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,280
All I know is that he played music too, and 
that he's French. He lives in Paris now.

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,440
Mum and my father met when he was 
working in Norwich for a year.  

37
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,320
They fell in love and soon got married. Dad 
moved into the house where Mum and I live now.  

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Norwich is a beautiful place, but it 
isn't as big and exciting as Paris.  

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,440
I think my father got bored. Or perhaps 
he was sad when I was born deaf.  

40
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,520
Because that's when he went away to live 
with his family in Paris. He never came back.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,440
Some of my friends don't talk 
to their parents very much.  

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,120
My friend Suzanne sometimes tells her mother she's 
with me when she's really with her boyfriend.  

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,760
She does this because her mum worries about her 
all the time. She worries about where she is and  

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
who she's with. But Mum and I are very close, and 
I couldn't tell her something that wasn't true.  

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,200
Anyway, she doesn't worry the way Suzanne's 
mum does, so I usually tell her everything.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,720
But I didn't tell her when I 
fell in love for the first time.

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,360
I don't know why. Perhaps it was because it 
felt so strange; because I felt so strange. It  

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,960
was almost like being on a boat on an angry 
sea. Sometimes I was afraid of how I felt.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,480
And there was another problem. I didn't know 
the name of the man I was in love with.
 
 
 

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
CHAPTER TWO

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,080
Shopping

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Just for a moment, try to think 
what it's like to live in my world.  

53
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,160
Stop what you're doing and 
put your hands over your ears.  

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,320
Are there no sounds at all? Or are the 
noises of the street just quieter than usual?

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,920
I know Mum loves listening to the sounds of birds 
singing in the countryside when we go walking.  

56
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,240
In my world there are no birds singing. 
There are no noisy men working on the roads.  

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,480
No people leaving bars late at night 
shouting at each other. No babies crying.

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,240
But the man I love doesn't live in my 
world. He lives in the hearing world.

59
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
The first time I saw him, he was standing in 
front of the shop across the road from our house.  

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
He was putting apples and oranges 
onto the table outside the shop  

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,880
and his black hair had blue 
lights in it from the sun.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,400
I watched him from my bedroom window, and I 
smiled at how carefully he was putting the  

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,280
fruit onto the table. He was like an artist, 
not a shop assistant. Then, as I watched,  

64
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,200
a big motorbike went up the street. The young man 
looked up and smiled as he watched it go past.  

65
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
I saw the motorbike go past, but 
he heard it first, then saw it.

66
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,200
After the motorbike was gone, he went back to his 
fruit. But then a small girl fell off her bicycle  

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,400
close to the shop and he ran to help her. He 
knew she wanted help because he heard her.

68
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
In only one minute, I already 
knew four things about him.

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
He had beautiful black hair.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
He liked motorbikes.

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,440
He was kind to apples, oranges and little girls.

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,920
And, of course, he could hear.

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
Until I first saw him, I didn't think very often 
about being deaf. It's all I've ever known,  

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,880
and I can't do anything to change it. And 
all my boyfriends have been deaf. But after  

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,160
I saw the young man, I wanted to be like most 
other people. I didn't want to be different.

76
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
I soon found out that he only 
worked at the shop on Saturdays.  

77
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,720
After that I went in there to buy something each 
Saturday. Every week I wanted to talk to him,  

78
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,000
but every week I just smiled and paid for 
my things. Things that I didn't really want.

79
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,080
Mum often looked at me strangely 
when I came back from the shop.  

80
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,920
'We didn't need any apples, 
Samantha,' she said once.  

81
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,240
'I bought some yesterday.' And another time, 
'We've already got biscuits in the cupboard.'

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
On Saturdays I always wanted to go to 
the shop, but I always felt afraid too.  

83
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
I never felt very comfortable 
as I walked across the road.  

84
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
I played with the money in my pocket 
like a child going to buy sweets.  

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,160
And then sometimes when I got to the shop I waited 
for a moment outside, reading the postcards in the  

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,360
window. People who want to sell things write 
about them on a postcard and the young man  

87
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,680
puts them in the window: 'Car, five years old. 
Cat needs good home, large fridge, nearly new.'

88
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
One Saturday I read all of the postcards 
twice before I went into the shop.  

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,960
Then, when I was inside, 
I didn't know what to buy.  

90
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,320
Mum and I always go to the supermarket on 
Fridays and I really didn't want anything.  

91
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
The young man was busy selling bread 
and cakes to a woman with two children.  

92
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
This gave me time to think, and in 
the end I decided to buy a newspaper.

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,200
The shop was often very busy on Saturdays. 
Usually the young man just had time to smile  

94
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,920
at me and take my money. But that morning it was 
different. After the woman and her children left,  

95
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,680
the shop was empty. There was 
only me and the young man.

96
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,560
When I took my newspaper to him to pay for it, 
he smiled. But when I tried to smile back at him,  

97
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,960
my mouth felt like wood. Then he said something to 
me. I watched his mouth closely. We had lessons at  

98
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,880
school to help us lip-read - to watch people's 
mouths to read their words when they talk.  

99
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,680
I can lip-read quite well. So I watched the young 
man's mouth and I thought he was talking about  

100
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:51,040
a fire. A big fire. Then I looked down at my 
newspaper and saw a picture of a house on fire.

101
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,000
It was a colour picture, and the fire was very 
big and red. I hoped nobody was in the house.

102
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,920
That's what I wanted to say to the young man: 'How 
terrible! I hope nobody was in the house.' But I  

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,200
didn't say it. I didn't say anything. I don't 
like speaking, you see. I don't like actually  

104
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,200
using my voice. When I was a child I often tried 
to talk and other children didn't understand me.  

105
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Sometimes they laughed. That's why 
I think my voice sounds strange.  

106
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
And I didn't want the young 
man to think I was strange.

107
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,480
When I looked up, the young man was speaking 
again. Then he wailed for me to answer him.  

108
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,120
But I didn't hear him, so I couldn't. So I just 
smiled and took my newspaper and left the shop.

109
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,520
But as I walked across the 
road to my house, I felt sad  

110
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,320
because I was sure he probably 
did think I was strange now.
 
 
 

111
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,240
CHAPTER THREE

112
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
My best friend

113
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,240
Mum looked at me when I went into the house 
with the newspaper. We signed to each other.

114
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,320
'Are you OK?' she asked, 
and I did my best to smile.

115
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,680
'Yes, I'm OK,' I said.

116
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,440
She looked at me for a moment as if she 
didn't quite believe me, and then she said,  

117
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
'Ron's here. He's in the living room.'

118
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,360
That made me happy again. 
Ron is my very best friend.  

119
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,680
We lived next door to each other when we 
were children. Now he's a student in London,  

120
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,720
and I don't get to see him very often. He's 
studying to be a teacher of deaf children.  

121
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,680
He wanted to become one because of me. Ron learnt 
to speak to me by signing when he was very young.

122
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,920
I went quickly into the living room. Ron 
was sitting on the sofa reading a magazine.  

123
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,280
When he saw me he put the magazine down. 
'Hi, Sam!' he signed to me and smiled.

124
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:00,080
'Hi, Ron.' I smiled back and kissed him. 
'How are you?' I was really happy to see him.  

125
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,240
I knew I could tell him about my problem with 
the man from the shop. Ron understood these  

126
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,240
things. I remember the first time he fell in 
love. It was with my friend Suzanne, actually.

127
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,720
Mum put her head round the door. I 
watched her mouth move as she asked  

128
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,280
Ron if he wanted a cup of tea. She likes 
Ron as much as I do. When we were children,  

129
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,840
she often took both of us to the sea for the day.

130
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Once I asked Ron what the 
sound of the sea was like.  

131
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,400
He said. The sea's loud when it gets to the 
beach. But it can be soft and quiet too.'

132
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
Usually I don't feel sad about 
being deaf, but I love the sea,  

133
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
and I would like to hear what 
it sounds like very much.

134
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I quickly told Ron about the man from the 
shop before Mum came back with the tea.

135
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,960
'Actually, I think I know him,' Ron said 
after a few moments. 'My brother's friend  

136
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,760
has a Saturday job at that shop. He's a student 
at the university. He lives in Pete's house'

137
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
Pete is Ron's brother. 'I couldn't believe it!  

138
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
My man lived in Pete's house! 
What's his name?' I asked.

139
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
'Jim, Ron told me.'

140
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,480
'Actually, Pete's having a 
party at his house tonight.  

141
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,720
Come with me. Jim will probably be there.'

142
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,720
Parties are difficult for me 
because I can't talk to people.  

143
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,400
It's different when I'm with my other deaf friends 
because we sign to each other and we laugh a lot.  

144
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,960
Going to a party with them is different 
to going to any other sort of party.  

145
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,880
We all speak the same language. When I'm 
at a party with them, I'm in the centre  

146
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,840
of things. At parties with hearing people, 
I'm on the outside. Or I feel as if I am.

147
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,160
Ron knew what I was thinking. 'Come to the 
party,' he signed. 'Please. I'd like you to come.'

148
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,240
'OK' I said at last, just as 
Mum came in with the tea.
 
 
 

149
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,240
CHAPTER FOUR

150
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,000
The party

151
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,720
Later I was looking at all my clothes when 
Mum came into my bedroom. I had a green dress  

152
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,880
in one hand and a short black skirt in the other 
hand. I wasn't happy with the dress or the skirt.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,560
Mum took a blue jumper from 
the bed and gave it to me.  

154
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,640
'The weather man on the television 
says that it will snow,' she said.  

155
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,840
Then she smiled and kissed me, and I 
felt bad that she didn't know about Jim.  

156
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
I decided to tell her as soon as there was 
anything to tell. If there was anything to tell.

157
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,320
It was almost spring, but it was still very 
cold. Ron and I stopped to buy some drinks on  

158
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,080
the way to the party and by the time we got 
to Pete's house it was beginning to snow.

159
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,480
Ron looked at me as we waited 
at the door. 'OK?' he asked.

160
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,840
I smiled at him. 'Yes,' I said. 'I'm OK.'

161
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,000
A girl opened the door and said hello to Ron. 
I didn't know her. She was very pretty and she  

162
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,840
was wearing a nice red dress. I smiled 
at her and followed Ron into the house.

163
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,560
Inside, we went into the kitchen. It 
was full of people. All the girls were  

164
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,760
wearing short dresses or skirts. I was 
the only one wearing a jumper and jeans.

165
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,440
Ron and I took our drinks into the living room. 
This room was full of people too. And it was  

166
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,240
hot - very hot -but I couldn't take my jumper 
off because I wasn't wearing a T-shirt under it.  

167
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,920
The jumper was a mistake, but 
I tried to forget about it.

168
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,200
'The music's very loud,' I said to Ron.

169
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,000
'How do you know that?' he asked and smiled.

170
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
'Because I can feel it in my 
legs,' I told him, and it was true.  

171
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,320
It was like my hand on Mum's guitar. The 
vibration of the music was travelling  

172
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,360
from the floor into my feet. Then it was 
going right up my legs and into my body.

173
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,120
A man came up to us. It was Pete. He said 
something to Ron, then looked right at me.  

174
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Pete knows I'm deaf of course. 
'Hello, Sam' I saw his mouth saying.

175
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,840
'Where's Jim?' I wanted to ask, but I 
didn't. I just said hello and smiled.  

176
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,080
Pete talked to us for a while, then he 
went to change the music. Ron talked to me.  

177
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,680
People in the room watched 
us talking with our hands.  

178
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,600
People often watch when I use sign language. 
It's interesting for them, I think.

179
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
Ron told me about the fun he was 
having with his new friends in London.  

180
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,360
He talked a lot about a girl called Mary.

181
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,800
'Is Mary your girlfriend?' I asked 
him, and his face went a bit red.

182
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,480
'At the moment she's just a friend,' he 
said. 'But I want her to be my girlfriend.'

183
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,960
I thought about Jim. Where was he? Why 
wasn't he here? The party was in his house!

184
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,400
Ron often knows what I'm thinking. 
'Hell come soon,' he told me.

185
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,840
Around ten o'clock, Ron was talking 
to some other friends across the room.  

186
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,960
I felt very hot in my jumper, so I decided 
to go into the garden for a short time.

187
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,200
Outside, everything was white. There was 
snow everywhere, and it was beautiful.  

188
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,320
The garden looked like a big white cake, 
and I was the first person to walk on it.

189
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,040
Or, I thought I was the first person to walk on 
it. But after a few moments I saw that I wasn't.  

190
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,440
I could see empty places in the snow made by 
shoes - footprints. But I couldn't see anyone.

191
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,880
But I knew someone was there 
because just then something  

192
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
very cold hit the side of my face. Snow!
 
 
 

193
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,160
CHAPTER FIVE

194
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,920
Snow fun

195
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,040
More snowballs flew past my face.  

196
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,200
Then I saw someone come out from behind a white 
tree. It was the man from the shop! It was Jim!

197
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,360
I laughed and quickly made a snowball. 
Then I sent it through the air.

198
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,400
But Jim moved so quickly to one side 
the snowball hit a tree behind him.  

199
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,000
So I started to make another snowball, but 
before it was ready, Jim threw a new one at me.

200
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,080
I laughed again. Then I ran behind a wall and 
made lots of snowballs. When they were ready,  

201
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,400
I came out from behind the wall. But Jim had made 
lots of snowballs too, and soon I was very wet.

202
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,720
After a few minutes I was 
laughing so much my stomach hurt,  

203
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,760
just the way it does when I'm laughing 
at parties with my deaf friends.

204
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
When I looked up at last, I saw that 
Jim was standing quite close to me.  

205
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
I also saw that something was 
wrong. He wasn't smiling now.  

206
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,560
He was looking at me. I remembered how he looked 
at me in the shop and I knew it was the same now.  

207
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,000
He was waiting for me to 
answer him. But I couldn't.

208
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,680
I looked into his face, waiting for him to 
speak again. After a while, he did, and this  

209
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,120
time I watched his mouth very carefully. There 
was an outside light on the side of the house.  

210
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
Anyway, the snow all around us 
made it almost as light as day.

211
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,040
'What's your name?' he asked. This time I knew 
it was very important for me say something.

212
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
'Sam,' I said carefully. 'My name's Sam.  

213
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,000
Samantha.' Then I told him: 'I 
can't hear what you say. I'm deaf.'

214
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
He looked at me for a very long time,  

215
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,960
and I wasn't sure if he understood. Then he 
smiled. 'Can you lip-read, Sam?' he asked.

216
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
I nodded. 'Yes,' I said. 'Usually.'

217
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,120
'Then lip-read this,' he said, moving his mouth 
carefully. 'The time for talking has finished.  

218
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,440
Get your snowballs ready!' Then he ran away and 
went back behind his tree. Before I could move,  

219
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
snowballs were coming through the air again.

220
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,400
I ran back behind my wall, laughing. 
My first snowball hit him in the face.  

221
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,880
But he sent one back which got me on my 
face. The snow was cold and wet in my eyes,  

222
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,680
but I didn't mind. I was happy. I knew Jim was 
throwing snowballs at me because he liked me.

223
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,480
Sometimes when people learn about me being deaf 
they're very careful with me. I feel like I'm a  

224
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
piece of expensive glass. It's difficult to 
be friends with a piece of expensive glass.  

225
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,680
Bui Jim wasn't careful with me and I liked that.

226
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,840
Soon I was very hoc. But I didn't want to stop. 
I wanted to throw snowballs at Jim all night.  

227
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,720
But after about five minutes, Jim stopped. When 
I looked over to see why, I saw his mouth was  

228
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,880
moving. But he wasn't looking at me, he was 
looking at someone behind me. I turned and  

229
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,760
saw a girl standing near the house. It was the 
girl in the red dress. The same girl who opened  

230
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,440
the door when Ron and I arrived at the party. 
She was saying something to Jim and she didn't  

231
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,800
look happy. She wasn't smiling and her eyes were 
cold. As cold as her legs in the short red dress.

232
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,680
Jim started to walk across the snowy grass. 
When he got near to me, he smiled and looked  

233
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,480
into my face. 'I'll win next time,' he 
said, then he went inside with the girl.

234
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,280
I stayed on in the garden for a few 
minutes more, but it wasn't much fun now.  

235
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
You can't really throw snowballs at yourself.

236
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
When I went back in the house 
I found Ron in the kitchen.

237
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,800
'Sam! You're still here,' he signed. 'I was 
looking for you.' He looked at my wet clothes.  

238
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
'What happened to your jumper?'

239
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Before I could answer I saw Jim on the other 
side of the kitchen. The girl in the red dress  

240
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,280
was talking to him, but he wasn't listening. He 
was watching me and Ron speaking with our hands.

241
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,240
Ron saw who I was looking at. 'Have 
you been outside with Jim?' he asked,  

242
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
and he smiled when my red face gave him my answer.

243
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,040
'I've been with Jim and about a hundred 
snowballs.' I smiled as I signed the words.

244
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,120
Ron laughed. More people came into 
the kitchen and he moved closer to me.  

245
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,920
There wasn't enough room for him to sign now, so 
he spoke carefully. 'It's very good to see you,  

246
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,560
Sam,' he said. I like London, but it's 
not so much fun without you there'.

247
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,840
Ron is like my brother. So when he kissed my face, 
I knew it was the kiss of a brother to his sister.

248
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,880
But I didn't know if Jim knew that.
 
 
 

249
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
CHAPTER SIX

250
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
Spring cleaning

251
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,520
The next Saturday was the first Saturday in 
Mareh. Mum always likes us to clean the house on  

252
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,560
the first Saturday in Mareh. She calls it spring 
cleaning. She was cleaning downstairs, and I was  

253
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,240
cleaning upstairs. I wanted to be upstairs because 
I could see the shop from my bedroom window.  

254
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,680
Downstairs there are always cars in the street 
outside and you can't see out very well.

255
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,640
I really wanted to see Jim again, and I looked out 
of the window often while I was cleaning. Once he  

256
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,120
came outside to put some fruit and flowers onto 
the cable, but he didn't look across the road.

257
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,960
The snowball fight was a week ago 
now. A week is a long time if you're  

258
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,640
in love. It was sunny and the snow 
was gone now. I was sorry about that.

259
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,480
'Haven't you finished this room, Sam?' 
Mum stood in front of me, signing.  

260
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,160
She couldn't understand why 
I was still cleaning my room.  

261
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,280
I'm usually quite quick ac cleaning. When I'm not 
looking out of windows and remembering snowballs.

262
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
'Sorry,' I answered, and she smiled.

263
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,720
'That's OK. Actually, can you go to the shop 
to get a bottle of window cleaner for me?  

264
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,040
I forgot to buy some.'

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,040
I couldn't believe it!  

266
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:39,680
She was sending me to the shop! 'Do you feel 
OK, Sam?' Mum asked me. 'You look hot.''

267
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,240
'Yes,' I answered. 'I feel fine.' 
But I knew my face was red.

268
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,080
'Are you sure?' she said. I'll 
go to the shop if you want.'

269
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,160
'No!' I signed. I'll go.' And I quickly 
went downstairs and left the house.

270
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,200
Jim was busy when I went into the shop. He was 
standing near the bottles of wine with a man.  

271
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
He was helping the man to 
decide which wine to buy.  

272
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,160
The man was quite short. Jim 
smiled at me over his head.

273
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,800
I smiled at him, and then I went over to the 
bottles of cleaner. Mum always buys the same  

274
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,640
window cleaner, but I stood in front of the 
different bottles as if I didn't know which  

275
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,840
one was best. I wanted the short man to choose his 
wine quickly and leave. I wanted Jim to myself.

276
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,360
At last the man left, carrying two 
bottles of wine, one-red, one white.  

277
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,440
I took my window cleaner over to Jim to 
pay for it. When I got there he was writing  

278
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,680
something on a piece of paper. Then he gave 
it to me. The writing was large and black.  

279
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,400
It was like an artist's writing. I read the 
words: 'I know more about snowballs than wine.'

280
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,080
I laughed.

281
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,720
'Did you enjoy our snowball fight? He wrote next.

282
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,360
I took the pen from him. 'Yes, 
I wrote, I did. Very much.'  

283
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,280
After he'd read my words, he looked 
at me. Then he started writing again.

284
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,040
'Is Ron your boyfriend?' I read.

285
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,320
This time I didn't write, I spoke. 'No,' I said. 
'He's my best friend. I haven't got a boyfriend.'

286
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,320
Jim understood me without any problem. Or I think 
he did, because he smiled. 'Do you want to meet  

287
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,920
me tomorrow night?' he said, and he moved his 
mouth carefully so I could lip-read his words.

288
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,760
'Yes,' I said. 'I'd like that.'

289
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,440
'How long does it take to 
buy window cleaner, Sam?'  

290
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,840
Mum asked me when I got back to 
the house, but I only smiled.

291
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,280
'Sorry, Mum' I signed and 
hurried quickly upstairs.

292
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
It wasn't until I started cleaning Mum's 
bedroom that I thought about the girl in  

293
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,840
the red dress again. Who was she? 
But I was afraid of the answer.  

294
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,080
I liked Jim too much and I didn't want to 
think about the girl in the red dress.
 
 
 

295
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,080
CHAPTER SEVEN

296
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,080
A new boyfriend

297
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,040
Next day, Mum and I went to Winterton for a 
walk. Winterton is one of my favourite places.  

298
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,840
It's cast of Norwich, by the sea. Winterton is 
where Mum took me and Ron when we were children.  

299
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,280
It takes about forty-five minutes to drive there.  

300
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
We put on our coats and made some coffee 
and some sandwiches to take with us.

301
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,040
On the beach it was cold but sunny.  

302
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,920
Some children were running by the sea with their 
dog. As we walked along, I told Mum about Jim.

303
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,160
When I was finished, my face was a bit red.  

304
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,040
'You really like him, don't 
you?' she said, looking at me.

305
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,160
It was windy by the sea. Mum's hair was all over 
her face, but I could see her smile through it.

306
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
'Yes,' I said, 'I do.'

307
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
Just for a moment, she looked a little sad.  

308
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,320
She walked ahead a short way, then she looked 
back at me. 'Love is wonderful,' she said,  

309
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,840
smiling again. 'Enjoy it while you 
can, Sam. Enjoy it while you can.'

310
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,400
I did enjoy myself that evening. Very much.

311
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,120
Jim and I went to a bar in the centre of 
Norwich. It was in the old area of town,  

312
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,880
close to the river. There was a pool 
table in the bar. I like playing pool.  

313
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,160
Ron taught me how to play, years 
ago. Now I'm better than him.

314
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Jim saw me looking at the pool table and 
the next moment he was putting some money  

315
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,120
into the side of it. We played and I 
won easily. It only took five minutes.

316
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,480
My last boyfriend got angry when he lost.  

317
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,760
But when I looked at Jim I saw 
that he was laughing. I liked that.

318
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,160
'Very good!' he said. 'But my 
snowballs are better than yours!  

319
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,320
Then he looked at me. 'Can you understand me?'

320
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:25,200
I smiled. 'Yes,' I said. 'I can understand 
if you speak slowly. Can you understand me?'

321
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,040
Jim smiled too. 'Yes,' he said, 
'I can understand you very well.'

322
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,840
We sat down together at a table and 
for the next two hours we talked.  

323
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,560
Most of the time we spoke to each other, 
and sometimes we wrote things down.  

324
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,400
I didn't think about how we were talking. I 
was too interested in what we were saying.

325
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,760
This was what I found out about Jim. He was 
twenty-one years old and he was studying English  

326
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,040
at university in Norwich. This was his last year 
as a student. His family lived in Derbyshire,  

327
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,960
in the middle of England. He had a brother of 
twenty-five, a sister of seventeen and a dog  

328
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,520
called Sky. He liked walking in the hills near 
his family home. He told me that in winter the  

329
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,160
hills were often white with snow. Winter was 
his favourite time. Then he told me the only  

330
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,240
two things he didn't like about Norfolk: there 
weren't many hills and it didn't snow very often!

331
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,640
Mum has told me that people who live in different 
places in England sound different when they speak.  

332
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,040
People from Derbyshire sound 
different to people from London,  

333
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,600
and people from London sound different to people 
from Norwich. They have different accents. So I  

334
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,600
knew that Jim probably had a different accent 
to the other people around us in the bar.

335
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Then Jim wanted to know about me, so 
I told him about my job at Busy Kids.  

336
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,640
I said that I spent a lot of my time playing, and 
that the children don't mind about me being deaf.  

337
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,400
I won't always work at Busy Kids, 'I finished,  

338
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,520
I like working there but I also like writing 
stories. One day I want to write a book.'

339
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,120
'I'm sure you will,' Jim said. 'You'll 
write a book and you'll be famous.'

340
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,040
'I just want to be happy,' I 
wrote on his piece of paper.  

341
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,760
But I was already happy. Happy being with Jim.

342
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,280
'What's it like to be deaf?' Jim asked 
then, and I thought for a moment.

343
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
'You don't mind me asking 
you that, do you?' Jim asked.

344
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,840
'No,' I wrote. 'I want to 
tell you. But it's difficult'

345
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,800
'I think it must be very peaceful,' Jim said. 
'I like noise, but sometimes I need to be quiet.  

346
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,680
That's when I go to the countryside for 
a walk.' He laughed. 'But actually the  

347
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,120
countryside can be a very noisy place! There 
are cars and animals and birds singing.'

348
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
'Mum likes listening to the 
birds sing,' I told him.

349
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,200
'Yes, I do too.' he said. And the 
sound of the wind in the trees.

350
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,080
'Sometimes my world is too quiet,' 
I said, and Jim touched my hand.

351
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,680
'Don't be sad,' he said, and I smiled.

352
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,000
'I'm not sad,' I said, and it was true. I was 
very happy, being with Jim. 'I think being deaf  

353
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,040
is a bit like swimming underwater,' I told 
him. 'You know, when you're swimming and you  

354
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,960
look up through the water. Everything looks 
different. The water changes everything.'

355
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,040
Jim moved his chair near to 
mine and took my hand in his.  

356
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,920
'Fish always live in the water,' 
he said. 'It's all they know.'

357
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,480
'Yes,' I said, and I knew he understood 
what I was trying to tell him.  

358
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,080
'Fish don't know that the water 
makes things look different.'

359
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,920
When the bar closed, Jim walked home with 
me. He had his bicycle with him. It was dark,  

360
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,880
so I couldn't read his lips, but I didn't 
mind. It was nice just to be with him.  

361
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,200
We lived in different worlds because I was 
deaf, and he wasn't. But it wasn't important.

362
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,360
Outside my house, we stopped under a 
street light. Jim looked into my eyes.  

363
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,080
'What's your mobile phone 
number? So I can text you.'

364
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,480
I told him my mobile phone number. Then I 
showed him how to say goodbye in sign language.  

365
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,080
He tried it a few times. Then, he showed 
me another way to say goodbye. With a kiss.

366
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,480
I liked that way best.
 
 
 

367
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,320
CHAPTER EIGHT

368
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,920
The girl in the red dress

369
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,160
That evening was the beginning of something 
wonderful, because Jim and I met often after that.  

370
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,480
Sometimes he went out with his 
friends or stayed at home to study.  

371
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,520
But we saw each other as often as we could.

372
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,280
We met in cafes or in bars, or we just went for 
walks. Sometimes we used pen and paper to talk,  

373
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,920
but usually I read his lips. I showed 
him some more sign language too.  

374
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,520
But often we didn't have to talk at all. We just 
liked being together. When we weren't together  

375
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,040
we sent each other text messages and emails. 
In this way we spoke to each other every day.  

376
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,720
Sometimes I felt I was living a dream, a very 
good dream. I was in love and I was very happy.

377
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,560
Until the day I met the girl in the red 
dress again. The girl from the party.

378
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,520
It was a Monday morning and I was on my way to 
work. Mum had left early to meet a new parent,  

379
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,840
so I was walking. It was a sunny 
day, and I was feeling good.  

380
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,440
I went to the shops to buy food for the 
children's lunches and then I walked  

381
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,040
through the park. I was probably thinking about 
Jim, because I was always thinking about Jim.

382
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,280
I didn't see the girl with the red 
dress until she stood in front of me.  

383
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,920
She wasn't wearing a red dress that 
day, of course, but I knew who she was.

384
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,440
'Hello,' I said, but she didn't say anything. 
She just stood there and looked at me. Then,  

385
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,760
when she started speaking, she 
talked really quickly. Too quickly.

386
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,320
'Please,' I said. 'Can you speak 
more slowly? I can't understand you.'

387
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,000
She looked cross. 'What?' I saw 
her say. 'I can't understand you!

388
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,240
My face went red, but I tried 
again, speaking carefully.  

389
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,360
'Please speak more slowly so I 
can read your lips. I'm deaf.'

390
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,040
When she spoke again, she spoke very slowly.  

391
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,040
Too slowly. I could understand every word. 'Jim 
was my boyfriend before he met you,' she said.  

392
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:59,760
'My boyfriend. We were very happy together. 
Very happy. I'm good for him in a way you  

393
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,520
can never be good for him. How can you be 
good for him? You can't hear his music!'

394
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,000
'His music?' I didn't understand what she meant.

395
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:18,480
She looked at me. 'Don't you know about 
his music?' she said. Jim plays in a band!  

396
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,440
I can't believe you don't know that! The 
band means everything to him. Everything.  

397
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,120
And he needs to be with someone who can hear his 
music. Jim writes songs. Didn't you know that?  

398
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,040
You really don't know Jim very well, 
do you? He writes songs and he plays  

399
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,440
them to me before he tries them with the 
band. He could never do that with you,  

400
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,760
could he? So stay away from him, understand? 
You'll never make him happy the way I do.'

401
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,920
She waited for a moment to see if I would say 
anything, but I was too hurt inside to speak.  

402
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,000
Hurt and afraid. So she said it one more 
time: 'Stay away from Jim.' Then she left.

403
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,480
There was a seat in the park under a tree. 
I sat down on it and watched her walk away.  

404
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,000
My head hurt. It was lull of her words. 
She was Jim's girlfriend until he met me.  

405
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,720
Was that true? Why didn't he tell me? And he 
played music in a band... Was that true as well?  

406
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,960
I thought I knew Jim, but now... I didn't know 
what to believe or to think I only knew that I  

407
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:41,120
was afraid. Very afraid. I knew why Jim never 
spoke to me about his music. Because I'm deaf.

408
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
Just then I felt my phone ring.  

409
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,520
I took it from my bag and looked at it. 
There was a text message from Jim.
 
 

410
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,520
Meet me tonight.

411
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,840
I love you, Jim
 
 

412
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,840
I didn't answer the message.

413
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:05,120
Mum looked at me when I arrived at Busy Kids. 'Are 
you all right, Sam?' she asked me. 'You look ill.'

414
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,720
'I'm OK,' I signed and I took the shopping into 
the kitchen where we make the children's lunches.  

415
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Mum followed me.

416
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,440
'Sam?' she said. 'What is it?'

417
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,360
I didn't want to talk about it. But Mum's 
face was very worried, so I told her.

418
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,320
'You must speak to Jim,' she said. 
'Do you want me to phone him?'

419
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,920
'No,' I said. 'No, thank you. I need to think.'

420
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,400
I was sad all day. No, I was worse than 
sad. My happy world was broken into pieces.

421
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
At four o'clock Mum told me to go home early.  

422
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,920
'I've got a friend coming for dinner, but I'm 
busy here,' she said. 'Can you cook something?'

423
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,640
I was happy to go home early, but I wasn't 
hungry. But I made a pizza for Mum and her friend.

424
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,560
Mum got home at six o'clock 
and went to have a shower.  

425
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,520
When somebody comes to the front door 
at our house, the lights go on and off.  

426
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,440
Then I know that someone's there. The lights 
in the kitchen went on and off while I was  

427
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,400
making a salad and Mum was in the shower. 
I went to the front door to see who it was.

428
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,040
I could see a man through the glass. It was Jim.

429
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,320
I opened the door. He was smiling, 
but I couldn't smile back.  

430
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,280
I was pleased to see him, but I was sad 
too, because of the meeting with the girl.

431
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:42,960
'Hi, Sam,' he said. 'These are for you.' Then 
I saw he had some flowers. Beautiful flowers.  

432
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,280
Red roses, lots of them. Flowers for 
a boyfriend to give to his girlfriend.  

433
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,360
But in my head I saw the girl 
from the party in her red dress.  

434
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,320
The roses were the same colour as her dress. Did 
Jim give her roses when he was her boyfriend?

435
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,880
'Thank you,' I took the flowers from 
him, and when I looked up again,  

436
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,040
Jim was saying something. Except of 
course I didn't know what it was.  

437
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,840
I don't think I have ever felt so sad 
about being deaf as at that moment.

438
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,040
Jim took the flowers back from me and put 
them down on a table inside the house.  

439
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,440
Then he put his arms around me. I knew he was 
trying to show me what he wanted to say to me.  

440
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,880
It was the same thing as his text message, 
the same thing as the roses: 'I love you.'

441
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,280
I was happy that Jim loved me. But I was still 
sad because I knew love wasn't enough.
 
 
 

442
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,200
CHAPTER NINE

443
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,840
Pizza and talking

444
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,960
When I was about fifteen years old, my 
favourite books and films were all love stories.

445
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,360
The stories were all the same. There was a 
man (the hero) and a woman (the heroine).  

446
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,440
They met. But there was always a problem which 
meant they could not be together at first.  

447
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,560
Perhaps the hero was hurt by love in the 
past and didn't want a girlfriend now.  

448
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,840
Or the heroine had an important job 
and didn't have time for a boyfriend.  

449
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,080
Anyway, these books or films always finish 
in the same way. The hero and the heroine  

450
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,920
know that they are in love, so the problems aren't 
important. The only important thing is their love.  

451
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,120
When we tell children stories we often 
finish, 'and they were happy ever after'.  

452
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,680
It's the same with love stories. The hero and 
the heroine are always 'happy ever after'.  

453
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,160
Happy together always, with no problems.

454
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,760
But real life is different to 
stories, and I'm not a heroine.  

455
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,400
Anyway, I read hundreds of 
those books when I was fifteen,  

456
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,000
and there was never a story about a deaf 
girl with a boyfriend who played music.

457
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,840
I moved away from Jim as Mum came down the stairs.  

458
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,800
Her hair was wet, but she was smiling at Jim. I 
soon saw that he was the friend coming to dinner.

459
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,000
'I don't want you to be sad,' she signed to 
me while Jim put the roses in some water,  

460
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,360
'so I phoned Jim and asked him to dinner. After 
we've eaten, you can tell him why you're sad.  

461
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
And until then, I can find out more about him.'

462
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,840
She was smiling like the children in 
the Busy Kids nursery smile sometimes.  

463
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,840
When they've done something a little bad. I 
don't usually feel angry with the children,  

464
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,520
and I couldn't feel angry with Mum.

465
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,120
While we are the pizza, Jim and Mum talked. 
Mum laughed a lot. I knew she liked Jim.  

466
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,480
Of course she liked Jim. Sometimes Mum signed to 
me to tell me what she and Jim were talking about:  

467
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,840
his studies at university, his family, her 
days as a musician with the Sweet Pepper Band.

468
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,960
'Jim's father plays guitar,' she told me.  

469
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,320
'He was quire famous when he was a 
young man. Isn't that interesting?'

470
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:04,320
Mum was like a young girl. She was having fun 
talking to Jim. But I sat quietly, watching  

471
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:12,560
them. I didn't eat very much. I wasn't hungry. I 
think Mum was asking Jim more questions about his  

472
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,240
family. But I just felt sad that I didn't already 
know about his father being a famous musician.

473
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,840
After two months of being Jim's girlfriend I 
didn't know his father was a famous musician.  

474
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
I didn't know about Jim playing in a band.  

475
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,360
And I didn't know that the girl from 
the party was his girlfriend before me.

476
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,520
What else didn't I know?

477
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,760
'I'm going out now,' Mum said to me after 
dinner. 'I'll wash the plates when I come home.  

478
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,400
You stay here and talk to Jim.'

479
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,400
I saw her say goodbye, and then she left.

480
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,560
I took Jim's plate. 'Do you 
want a coffee?' I asked him.

481
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,560
'No, thank you,' he said. He was looking at 
me, waiting, but I didn't know what to say  

482
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,680
or how to begin. I only knew that I wanted to 
sign to him what I was thinking and feeling.  

483
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,360
I wanted him to understand signing. 
Signing is my first language and I  

484
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,640
wanted to talk to him about the girl 
from the party in my first language.

485
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,560
Jim waited until I was looking at him. 
'Your mum told me what happened,' he said.  

486
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,960
'She told me about Lauren.'

487
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,560
So, I thought, that's what she's called. Lauren. 
I didn't like her and I didn't like her name.

488
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,760
'Sam,' Jim said, 'Lauren wasn't my 
girlfriend when you and I met at the party.  

489
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,000
We did go out together for a few 
months, but that was last year.  

490
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:45,440
We're just friends now. Or we were friends.' 
Oh, I'm so angry with her for hurting you!

491
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,960
I didn't think Jim would lie to me. But 
he didn't tell me about his music...

492
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,120
Jim knew what I was thinking. 'I'm sorry I 
didn't tell you about my music,' he said.

493
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,280
'You didn't tell me because it's a 
problem,' I said, but he didn't agree.

494
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,080
'No,' he said, 'that's not true.'

495
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,560
'Yes, it is,' I said.

496
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,080
I told him he loves music and I can't hear music.  

497
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,000
It's a big problem- I told him he doesn't want a 
deaf girlfriend, he wants a hearing girlfriend.

498
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,040
But now Jim couldn't understand me. I wasn't 
speaking very well because I was angry and sad.  

499
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,760
So I wrote it down for him: 'You want a girlfriend 
who can hear your music. I'm not good for you.'

500
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,480
Jim's face was very sad. 'Don't 
say that,' he said. 'It isn't true.  

501
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,760
I know what I want, and that's you. You are 
good for me, Sam. You're very good for me.'

502
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,840
When I didn't answer, Jim started to 
write again: 'I want to be with you, Sam.'

503
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,960
'I want to be with you too.'  

504
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,960
That's what I wanted to write. But I didn't, 
because I couldn't forget Lauren's words.

505
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,560
Maybe Jim did want me. Maybe Lauren just 
wanted to hurt me. But her words were true.  

506
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,120
I could never know Jim, the man who played 
music. So, could I ever really know Jim?
 
 
 

507
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,360
CHAPTER TEN

508
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,600
Jim's band

509
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,960
Jim went home after that. I told 
him to go because I needed to think.  

510
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,360
Before he went, he wrote something down 
and gave it to me. I read it after he left.

511
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,240
It said: 'I believe that sometimes it's 
more important to feel than to think.  

512
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,320
We love each other. Don't forget that.'

513
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:43,680
I didn't forget it. I thought about it all the 
time. But I also remembered Lauren's words.  

514
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,480
And Jim's music. It was the worst time of my life.

515
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:56,640
Mum knew I was sad. 'Take a holiday from work, 
Sam,' she told me. 'Visit Ron in London.'

516
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,360
I thought it was a good idea. I 
always had fun with Ron. So I went.

517
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,760
But it's difficult to have fun with 
anyone when your world is in pieces.  

518
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,840
I was in London, not Norwich, but I still was 
thinking about Jim; I wasn't having fun at all.  

519
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,760
And I soon saw that Ron and his friend Mary were 
boyfriend and girlfriend now, not just friends.

520
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,640
Ron felt bad about Jim and me. He tried not 
to be too happy about Mary when I was there.  

521
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,400
He didn't want me to feel worse. But 
every time he looked at her, he smiled.  

522
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,840
And I understood. Of course I understood! 
Until a week ago it was the same for me.  

523
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,200
I felt happy every time I looked 
at Jim. But not anymore...

524
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,040
A few days later, when it was time for me to 
catch the train home, Ron took me to the station.  

525
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,480
We stood together on the station platform with 
hundreds of people hurrying to work around us.

526
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,280
Ron signed to me, 'Sam, I don't think 
of you as my deaf friend,' he said.  

527
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,960
I think of you as my kind, funny 
friend. I'm sure it's the same for Jim.'

528
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,720
'I'm so lucky to have you 
as my friend,' I told him.

529
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,040
We kissed and said goodbye, and then I 
got on the train. I wanted to believe Ron,  

530
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,760
but Lauren's words were always in my head: 'Jim 
wants to be with someone who can hear his music.'

531
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,840
I knew it was true.

532
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,680
When I got home Mum looked at me. She saw 
in my face that nothing was different.  

533
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:38,880
'Send Jim a text message, Sam,' she said. 'Please. 
Speak to him. I hate to see you like this.'

534
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,760
'I can't,' I told her.

535
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,080
She looked at me for a long time. 
'Do you know what I think?' she said.  

536
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,360
'I don't think this is about Jim at 
all. I think it's about your father.'

537
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,720
I looked at her, but I didn't say 
anything. I wanted to know what she meant.

538
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,800
'I didn't want to tell you this,' 
she said, 'but now I think its best.'

539
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,240
Mum's face was sad, and I felt afraid.

540
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,520
'What is it?' I asked.

541
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,160
She closed her eyes for a moment. 'Your 
father left us because he met another woman:  

542
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,200
a woman who didn't have any children and who 
thought your father was wonderful. She didn't  

543
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:28,000
want to play guitar or have children. She only 
wanted to be with him. Sam, your father didn't  

544
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,320
leave because you were deaf. He left because 
he didn't want to be a father to any child.'

545
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,560
Mum was very sad now. She was 
crying and her face was wet.  

546
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,800
I wanted to put my arms around 
her, but she started signing again.

547
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,480
'You think Jim will leave you after a few months 
because you're deaf. But I think you're wrong. Jim  

548
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,720
isn't the same as your father. He doesn't 
just think about himself. He's a good man  

549
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,880
and he loves you.' She smiled at me. 
'Oh, Sam, I understand, I really do.  

550
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,720
When you love somebody you feel afraid. But it's 
better to feel afraid than to feel sad. Sometimes  

551
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,840
you have to fight for what you want.' She put 
her arms around me and soon we were both crying.  

552
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,640
Then, after a few minutes, she smiled at 
me. She looked happy now, like Mum again.

553
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:30,240
'Get your coat,' she told me. 'I know 
where Jim is. We can go to see him.'

554
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,120
I didn't ask any questions, I just did 
what she said. I wanted to see Jim.  

555
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,680
I wanted to see him very much.

556
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,080
Mum drove through the city centre. I didn't know 
where we were going or how she knew where Jim  

557
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,480
was- I was busy thinking about love stories 
and about the problem keeping me from Jim.

558
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,280
It wasn't that I was deaf and it wasn't 
because my dad left when I was born.  

559
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,280
It was me. I was making problems because 
was afraid. I was fighting against something  

560
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,200
I really wanted, and it was stupid. I could 
never kill my love for Jim; it was too strong.

561
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,840
After ten minutes the car stopped 
and I saw we were near a church.  

562
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,600
But Mum didn't go into the church, she went up 
to the building next to it, St Marks Church Hall.

563
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:26,320
Before she opened the door, I stopped her. 'How 
did you know where to find Jim?' I asked her.

564
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,120
Mum smiled. 'I came here while you were 
in London,' she said and smiled again.  

565
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,800
'Follow me. It's all right.'

566
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,480
Then she opened the door and went in. 
After a moment I went in after her.  

567
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,200
And there was Jim with four other men. They were 
playing music, and I knew this was Jim's band.

568
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:55,200
Jim was playing drums. There were four drums of 
different sizes. Jim was playing all of them.  

569
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,520
His hands were moving very quickly. Quicker 
than Mums hands when she's speaking to me.  

570
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,600
I watched him play for a few moments. At 
first he didn't see me, but I was happy  

571
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,760
just to look at him. It was very good to see 
him again. And now I was really seeing him.  

572
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,240
Because this was the Jim who played 
music: this was the real Jim.
 
 
 

573
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,240
CHAPTER ELEVEN

574
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,480
Happy ever after

575
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,960
I knew the music was loud because I 
fell the vibration of the sound in  

576
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,680
the floor under my feet- Mum 
put her hands over her ears.

577
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,640
When Jim saw me there was not as much vibration 
because he stopped playing his drums. He got up  

578
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,240
and walked over to me and his friends stopped 
playing too. I think everyone was looking at us,  

579
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,160
but I'm not sure. All I remember is Jims smile 
and the love in his eyes before he kissed me.

580
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,760
As I kissed him back, I forgot to be afraid.  

581
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,880
This was Jim and I loved him. 
There was nothing to be afraid of.

582
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,840
After a few moments he moved about a 
metre away and started to sign to me.  

583
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,960
He made some mistakes, but I understood.  

584
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:11,360
Just as he understood when I spoke to him. And 
I remembered his fast hands on the drums...

585
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,360
There was no problem.

586
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,000
This is what he signed to me:  

587
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,240
'Your mum taught me some sign language. Now 
I'll teach you to play drums. Come with me.'

588
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,800
Before I could answer, Jim took my hand in 
his. We moved to stand with his friends.  

589
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,520
Mum was smiling at me. Everyone was smiling.

590
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,960
Jim stood behind me and his hands were on 
my hands and then I was playing the drums.  

591
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,160
And the vibration travelled from the drums to my 
hands and up my arms to my head. It was wonderful.

592
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,600
As wonderful as my small hand on 
the front of Mum's guitar.
 
 
 
 

593
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,124
- THE END -
