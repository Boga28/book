00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,410
North Sea Eyes
Love is a dangerous emotion, let me tell you.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,871
And it always happens when you're least expecting
it.

3
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:16,299
It creeps up on you and jumps on you out of
the blue.

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:24,039
It grabs you by the throat, shakes you and
says, 'I'm here!

5
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,940
You'd better take notice of me!'

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,701
I mean, think about it.

7
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:30,701
One minute you're going along very nicely,
thank you.

8
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:34,660
You get up every morning for work and you
come home every evening.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,120
You make dinner.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,059
You watch your favourite TV program on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

11
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,620
You go out, you come in.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,129
You have a drink on Friday nights.

13
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:50,070
The highlight of your week is lunch out on
Sundays.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,570
That's life as you know it.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,699
At least you think you're alive, but then
real life comes along and does a little dance

16
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,160
in front of you and you realize that you've
been half dead.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,200
That's the way it was when I met Ria.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,900
One minute I was just going along like this,
bored but kind of OK.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,540
Well at least I was healthy.

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:22,070
Next thing I knew I was out late at night,
freezing to death, doing all kinds of strange

21
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,070
things.

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,680
And it seemed to me that I just had to do
them; somehow I didn't have any choice.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,950
Now I don't know about you, but there's a
certain pattern to my falling in love.

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,150
First of all, it always happens in winter,
so it's freezing cold.

25
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,491
October, November and December are the usual
months, and they're cold in Holland, really

26
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,491
cold.

27
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:56,110
And in The Hague the wind comes off the sea
and goes right through you like a knife.

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,190
Not the kind of weather for hanging around
on street corners or in telephone boxes, but

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,770
that's always what I end up doing.

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,120
One day I'm going to bed at nine thirty with
a good book, the next I'm out at one o'clock

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,409
in the morning, knowing that I'm going to
be exhausted the next day.

32
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,040
Exhausted, but excited.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,930
Then comes a cold, or even worse, flu.

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,840
I'd like to fall in love in summer, but it
never happens that way.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,269
Then there's the poetry.

36
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:39,719
Suddenly I start writing poetry; it just pours
out of me.

37
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:46,779
And it's all deep meaningful stuff that has
to be written in the early hours of the morning,

38
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:49,700
usually accompanied by lots of alcohol.

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:58,959
So the next day, on top of the cold I already
have, I have a hangover from the drink.

40
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,889
It's a miracle that my boss hasn't sacked
me.

41
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:08,969
And the worst bit is when I realise that there's
probably another man in her life.

42
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:15,200
And of course he's really good looking and
has a sports car and a big bank account.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,389
So everything followed more or less the usual
pattern with Ria.

44
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:24,989
First came the cold and the poems.

45
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,560
I hadn't seen the good-looking boyfriend yet,
but I had the feeling that it was just a matter

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,060
of time.

47
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,881
There was something about Ria that was different,
though.

48
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,180
She was different from other girls.

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,049
First of all there was her job.

50
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,110
She was a tram driver.

51
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,290
But let me tell you a little bit about myself,
because no doubt you're wondering what an

52
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,499
English guy is doing living in Holland, in
The Hague to be exact.

53
00:03:55,499 --> 00:04:02,379
Well, my name's Harry Brent, I'm twenty-nine
and I've been here for two years.

54
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:07,669
I work for an international import and export
company, JGD.

55
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:12,739
They're based in Manchester but have offices
all over Europe.

56
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,570
They sent me here to work in their Dutch office.

57
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,230
I'll probably be here for another two or three
years.

58
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,350
Import and export.

59
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,240
Sounds kind of boring, eh?

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,170
Well, it's OK really, and Holland is an interesting
country.

61
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,220
For one thing, you can more or less do what
you want here.

62
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,400
I mean, it's very liberal, very tolerant.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,470
And although I don't really do much that's
exciting, if you know what I mean, I like

64
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,470
it.

65
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,490
I like the atmosphere and just the thought
that if I wanted to take all my clothes off

66
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,100
in the middle of the street, no one would
care.

67
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
No.

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,570
No one would even notice.

69
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,420
So, like I say, I live in The Hague.

70
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,420
It's not as beautiful or as exciting as Amsterdam,
but it has its advantages.

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:18,290
The best thing about it is that it's near
a place called Scheveningen, which is almost

72
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,020
unpronounceable but lovely.

73
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,660
It has long soft sandy beaches, which are
wonderful for walks.

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,580
And the sea here, the North Sea, is just beautiful,
a soft blue-grey.

75
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,380
I go to the beach a lot.

76
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,550
The traffic in The Hague is pretty bad, but
it has good public transport.

77
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:50,140
The noisy red trams and their rails are a
familiar sight and that's how I get about.

78
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,560
Number one to work, number three to the city
centre.

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
And number eleven from my place down to the
beach.

80
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,310
I live alone in one of those typical tall
Dutch houses on a little street between the

81
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,210
city centre and the beach.

82
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:16,440
I often go down to the beach after work and
at weekends, to walk and relax and look at

83
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,780
the sea.

84
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,051
Which brings me back to Ria.

85
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:28,530
I first noticed Ria when I was going to the
beach on tram eleven one Sunday afternoon.

86
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,150
It was early October and a beautiful cold
bright day.

87
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,330
The tram suddenly stopped somewhere in the
middle of nowhere; something was stuck on

88
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,890
the rails.

89
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:46,830
It happens a lot, and I didn't take much notice
until I looked out of the window and saw the

90
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,110
tram driver removing a small piece of wood.

91
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,080
Now, you can get on a tram in Holland without
seeing the driver, and that's exactly what

92
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,390
I'd done.

93
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,970
But now I saw her, I couldn't take my eyes
off her.

94
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,990
I've never seen a tram driver wear a uniform
as well as Ria did.

95
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,920
She was tall and slim.

96
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,210
And even from a distance I could see that
she was beautiful, with long dark hair.

97
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,740
Really attractive.

98
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:28,340
She was wearing a skirt, unlike most female
tram drivers who usually wear trousers.

99
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,840
And she had legs that seemed to go on forever.

100
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,600
Yeah, she was different.

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:44,980
But the most amazing thing about Ria was her
eyes, which I noticed straight away, and which

102
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:51,330
were the exact colour of the North Sea, a
lovely soft blue-grey.

103
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:59,500
And those eyes kind of grabbed me, that's
the only way I can put it, so that I couldn't

104
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,560
think of anything else.

105
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,850
I'd been grabbed by the throat.

106
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,710
Well, she got back into the tram and we carried
on towards the beach.

107
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,340
I moved up the tram so that I could be nearer
to her.

108
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,990
And I just looked at her all the way to the
beach, though I tried not to let her see.

109
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,600
I was kind of dazed, as if I'd been hit on
the head.

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I was confused, I don't mind telling you.

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,620
Anyway, the number eleven stops at the beach,
on the south side of Scheveningen not too

112
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,230
far from the port; it's the end of the tramline.

113
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:47,029
It waits for ten or fifteen minutes, turns
round and goes back to the city.

114
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:55,390
I got out and just sort of hung around for
a while, looking at Ria but pretending I wasn't

115
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,870
looking.

116
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,510
The idea of going away was scary; I might
never see her again.

117
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,690
After a few minutes, Ria got out of the tram
and talked for a while to another tram driver.

118
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,830
That's when I discovered that she was called
Ria, because I heard him shout something to

119
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,830
her.

120
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,870
It looked like she was going to drive tram
eleven back to the city.

121
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:27,530
I had a little time so I went over to the
other side of the road and bought some chips

122
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:34,650
from a little shop near the beach, keeping
my eyes on the tram, and Ria, all the time.

123
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:42,550
Then I walked back slowly to the tram, eating
my chips and mayonnaise - I know it's a strange

124
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,200
combination, but I've got used to it.

125
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,190
I got back on the tram and went back to the
city with Ria.

126
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,370
So that was it really.

127
00:09:52,370 --> 00:10:00,340
For the next two weeks I spent all of my spare
time on trams, especially on tram eleven,

128
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,550
hoping that she would be the driver, and that
I'd get to see her.

129
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,390
I got to love that little red tram; it was
kind of comforting.

130
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:16,089
I also spent a lot of time waiting for trams,
which is when I got the cold.

131
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,600
I got to know her routine, and I managed to
see a lot of her one way or another.

132
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,460
And at nights I would go home to my house
and write poetry.

133
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:34,500
Anyway, one late afternoon I was waiting for
the tram on the platform.

134
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,980
It pulled up and, as luck would have it, Ria
was driving.

135
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,300
I was feeling kind of brave that particular
day, and I got on at the front, just so I

136
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,640
could really see her.

137
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:56,230
As I got on, she smiled at me and said, 'goede
middag,' which means, 'Good afternoon.'

138
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:02,720
Well, not so unusual you might think, but
I knew when she said it that she recognised

139
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
me.

140
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,030
It was the way her eyes met mine.

141
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,710
I don't remember much about that tram ride,
I can tell you!

142
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,200
I could feel my face burning red.

143
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,440
I was completely overcome with it all.

144
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,690
I kept reliving that moment when she had said
'goede middag for days afterwards.

145
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,780
Well, from then on we said hello to each other
quite often.

146
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:35,330
I was working towards asking her out, you
know, kind of trying to find the courage.

147
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,230
Finally, one Friday evening, I knew I had
to go for it.

148
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,330
For one thing, it was starting to look very
strange, you know, me following her around

149
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,390
like that.

150
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,810
I didn't want anyone to think I was some kind
of weird guy who follows women - you know,

151
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,950
a stalker or something.

152
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,720
So this particular Friday evening I left work
at six o'clock as usual.

153
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,200
What I needed was a drink, I thought.

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,150
Otherwise there was no way I could talk to
Ria, not really talk, I mean.

155
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:16,510
The office where I work is near the centre
of the city, on a street called Korte Voorhout,

156
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,090
so I decided to go to the Dudok.

157
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,270
It's a big new bar just a few minutes' walk
away.

158
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,060
A cool kind of place, if you know what I mean.

159
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,400
A fashionable place to be seen.

160
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,470
I sometimes went there for a quick drink after
work, just because it's near the office.

161
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:41,970
The Dudok was already crowded; it was a popular
spot for an early evening drink, what the

162
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,660
Dutch call a borrel.

163
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,290
Yeah, it was definitely borrel time.

164
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,680
I found a place at the bar and drank a couple
of beers quickly.

165
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,440
There was a new barman there, a friendly sort
of bloke who came over and started chatting.

166
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,300
'English, eh?' he asked.

167
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,649
Turned out his brother had gone to work in
London.

168
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,279
I didn't have the heart to tell him I'd never
been there.

169
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,690
I mean, just Heathrow airport.

170
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,270
So I just nodded when he mentioned Notting
Hill and Chiswick.

171
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,140
'Lovely part of London, Chiswick,' he said.

172
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,279
'Gorgeous,' I said.

173
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,860
'Another beer?'

174
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,810
'Er, I'd better not,' I said weakly.

175
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,810
'Come on,' he said.

176
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,029
'It's... how do you say it...?

177
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:33,850
On the house.'

178
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:40,970
Anyway, he was a friendly guy, like I said.

179
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,630
He kept coming over to talk to me from time
to time, and I kept drinking.

180
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,490
I was thinking about what I was going to say
to Ria, to be honest, and I wasn't getting

181
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,490
very far.

182
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:01,940
After about an hour, he asked me, 'So, what
are you doing all alone on a Friday evening,

183
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,230
Harry?'

184
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,459
By then we were on first-name terms.

185
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,610
His was Hans.

186
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:14,410
Well, I'd had a few beers by then, so I told
him about Ria.

187
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:21,350
I told him about tram eleven and the fact
that I'd decided to try to get to know her

188
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,140
and to ask her out.

189
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,480
Hans smiled at me with big round eyes.

190
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,339
'Oh, well, good luck, Harry,' he said.

191
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,200
'And I hope she doesn't disappoint you.

192
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,020
They say that Dutch women are really strong!

193
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,680
You take care of yourself.'

194
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,250
Funny thing to say, I thought.

195
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,790
Anyway, I had a few more beers, and before
I knew it was eleven o'clock!

196
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:57,390
I felt like I knew London like the back of
my hand, but that wasn't the point.

197
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,020
The point was to talk to Ria and ask her out,
I told myself.

198
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,839
It was time to get on tram eleven.

199
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,430
I wasn't totally drunk, though I must say
I'd had enough.

200
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:18,990
I said goodbye to the barman and ran off to
catch tram one so that I could get on tram

201
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,959
eleven at the Hollands Spoor Station.

202
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:28,839
On the platform I stood where the front of
the tram would stop to make sure that it was

203
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,100
Ria driving.

204
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,880
The first driver was a man, some big blond
guy with a moustache, so I waited for the

205
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,180
next.

206
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,420
Ah, there she was!

207
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,681
She looked as attractive as ever, with those
lovely North Sea eyes.

208
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:51,080
I got on at the back of the tram this time.

209
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
I didn't want her to see me before I was ready,
if you know what I mean.

210
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,529
I put my tram ticket in the little machine
and sat right at the back.

211
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,060
It was late October by now and it was really
cold and windy.

212
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,680
As a matter of fact, it's always windy in
The Hague.

213
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,600
But the moon was up and it was nice and clear.

214
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,160
I still wasn't sure how I was going to approach
her but, like I said, I had to try.

215
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:31,520
Well, I sat there and sat there and I couldn't
think of a way to talk to her - I mean, say

216
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,040
more than 'Good evening.'

217
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,060
What do you say?

218
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,010
'Do you come here often?'

219
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,700
I just couldn't imagine myself asking her,
if you know what I mean.

220
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,010
Truth is, I'm not very good with women, I
suppose.

221
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,920
So, before I knew it, we were at the beach
and everybody had to get off.

222
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,810
There were about ten people on the tram, mostly
people who lived up there, I reckoned, and

223
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,430
they all got off and walked away pretty quickly.

224
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,810
I got off quickly too so that Ria wouldn't
see me.

225
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:11,110
I went and stood behind the tram shelter,
where I could see her but she couldn't see

226
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,110
me.

227
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:17,230
It was obvious from the way that she collected
her stuff together that she was going off

228
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,230
duty.

229
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,740
I tried to think of a way of hanging around
for a while and kept my eye on her.

230
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,480
Then, she said something to another tram driver
who was going to take the tram back to the

231
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,470
city centre and then she set off walking quickly
in the direction of the port.

232
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:43,960
I didn't know what to do, to be honest, seeing
her go like that, so I followed her.

233
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,520
Oh, I know it looked like I was stalking her,
which is exactly what I said I didn't want

234
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
to do.

235
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,250
But it seemed like my only choice.

236
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,640
Like I said, love is a dangerous emotion.

237
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,630
Well, by now the wind was blowing up a storm
over the North Sea and the sky was full of

238
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,590
huge black clouds.

239
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,540
Dutch weather is like that old joke: 'If you
don't like it, just wait a while and it'll

240
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
change.'

241
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:23,980
The sky reminded me of one of those paintings
you see at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, painted

242
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,750
by Rembrandt or Vermeer or someone.

243
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,280
It wasn't raining yet, but it was only a matter
of time.

244
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,760
I kept quite far behind Ria.

245
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,300
Well, I didn't have much choice, to be honest.

246
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,740
She was a very fast walker!

247
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,410
She kept up a quick pace along the seafront,
trying to get home before the storm blew up,

248
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,679
I suppose.

249
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,400
I was almost running, just to keep her in
sight!

250
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,200
I suppose I was drunk too, to be honest, and
it's hard to move fast when you've drunk too

251
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
much.

252
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,360
There were a few people still around, coming
out of the bars and restaurants in Scheveningen

253
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,770
and walking to their cars, or just taking
the sea air.

254
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,910
I didn't look too strange.

255
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,650
It was about midnight by now.

256
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:20,384
I was thinking to myself 'this is stupid,'
and telling myself that I was a coward but,

257
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,500
like I say, I couldn't help it.

258
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,760
The beach front at Scheveningen is long, and
there's a kind of wide path that goes right

259
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,390
down towards the port.

260
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,230
That was obviously where Ria was heading,
so I was thinking that she had to live somewhere

261
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,960
near the port.

262
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,660
Part of the old fishing village, the original
Scheveningen, is down there.

263
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,380
So I carried on walking, following her.

264
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:53,340
The weather at the beach changes pretty quickly,
like I said, and, sure enough, before long

265
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,179
it started raining quite hard, that kind of
horizontal rain you get around here.

266
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:07,200
I didn't have an umbrella of course, so soon
I was completely soaked.

267
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,549
After about twenty minutes' walk, we got near
the port.

268
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:17,320
At the beginning of the port area, there are
a lot of fish restaurants and small bars.

269
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,320
But by now they were almost all closed, and
the place was nearly deserted.

270
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,810
Ria looked round at one point, but I was far
enough away that she couldn't recognize me.

271
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,750
Then we got into the port itself.

272
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,400
There were quite a few boats there: a few
local fishing boats, and some ships with the

273
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,060
names of English ports on them.

274
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:48,860
Around the harbour itself it was pretty dark,
and the only noise I could hear was the sound

275
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,130
of Ria's heels on the pavement.

276
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:58,130
Right in the corner of the harbour there's
a little bar called De Hoek.

277
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,250
It's a place where the fishermen go, and some
Scheveningen locals.

278
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,481
I'd never been in there myself, though I'd
heard people at the office talk about it.

279
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:13,480
It had a reputation as a wild kind of place.

280
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,290
It was still open; I could see a kind of dim
yellow light and there was music and voices

281
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,669
coming from inside.

282
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:24,640
I looked at my watch.

283
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,020
It was one o'clock!

284
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,500
It was late, but the bar was so far away from
any houses that it could probably stay open

285
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,960
as long as it liked, I thought.

286
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,830
Anyway, Ria walked over towards it, opened
the door and went right in.

287
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,610
Odd, I thought.

288
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,660
Did she live there, or was she just going
in for a quick drink before bed?

289
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,400
Hard to say.

290
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,090
By now the rain had died down a bit, so I
decided to wait a little longer.

291
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,270
Well, I was already wet through so it didn't
matter.

292
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,741
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but that's what
I told you.

293
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,520
You do strange things when you're in love.

294
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,679
So I waited quite a while.

295
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,560
My mind was working overtime, I can tell you.

296
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,690
Did she live here, or did her boyfriend live
here?

297
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,630
There had to be a boyfriend.

298
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,990
Perhaps he was a fisherman or sailor!

299
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,610
A good-looking sailor with a sports car and
a big bank account of course.

300
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,110
That would be just my luck.

301
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,082
So there I was, waiting.

302
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:40,880
And I thought, 'Hey, I haven't got anything
to lose.'

303
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,940
You know what I mean?

304
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,400
So what if she's got a boyfriend?

305
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,290
It can't be any worse than standing out here,
dripping wet and shivering.

306
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:57,670
By now I was like a dog that had just come
out of the sea.

307
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,330
And it looked like it was going to start raining
again.

308
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,460
So I walked over to the bar and opened the
old wooden door.

309
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,990
The only things I noticed at first were the
overpowering smell of cigars, and a fair amount

310
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,990
of smoke.

311
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,480
I could hear music playing too, sounded like
jazz.

312
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,559
I looked around, trying to see Ria.

313
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,910
'Are you sure you want to come in here?'

314
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,970
I looked up into the face of a huge Dutch
guy.

315
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:32,650
He was standing right next to me blowing smoke
in my face.

316
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,059
'Er, I'm not sure,' I answered.

317
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:41,090
'Well, decide,' he said.

318
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,610
The bar was full of people, men mainly, though
there were a couple of women too.

319
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,299
I looked around for Ria, but I couldn't see
her anywhere.

320
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:58,780
I moved away from the tall Dutchman and pushed
through the crowd towards the bar.

321
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:05,070
As I moved through the smoke I could see a
kind of stage on the other side of the room.

322
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,150
And on the stage someone was dancing to the
music.

323
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:16,610
After a minute or so, my eyes got used to
the smoke and the dim light, and I could see

324
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,610
the dancer.

325
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,549
It took me a little while to work out that
she was completely naked!

326
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:27,250
Well, I didn't know where to look, I can tell
you.

327
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:33,820
The big Dutch guy was looking at me, smiling
and watching for my reactions.

328
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,950
I sort of smiled back.

329
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,950
To be honest, I wanted to leave.

330
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,950
I felt kind of embarrassed.

331
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:48,210
But I didn't want to seem foolish or anything,
so I acted like it was the most natural thing

332
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,380
in the world.

333
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,660
I ordered a beer, though it was the last thing
I wanted, to tell you the truth.

334
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,700
I just wanted to run out of there, Ria or
no Ria.

335
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,360
Then the music stopped and everyone clapped.

336
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,270
'Oh good,' I thought, 'this is my chance to
get out of here.'

337
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:15,590
But the music started again almost immediately
and someone else came onto the stage.

338
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:20,130
'Look at this,' said the big Dutch guy, pushing
my elbow.

339
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,130
'You'll like this!'

340
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:34,520
I smiled kind of awkwardly, and looked over
to the little stage and at the face of the

341
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
new dancer.

342
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,240
She was wearing a bit more make-up than usual,
but there was no mistaking those eyes.

343
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,059
It was Ria!

344
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,090
Well, I was shocked, I can tell you!

345
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,090
But it got worse.

346
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,500
The music started and Ria started taking her
clothes off.

347
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,370
Everyone in the bar was shouting and whistling.

348
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:02,190
Part of me wanted to leave, but the other
part just made me stay there.

349
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,070
I couldn't move.

350
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:10,289
Little by little, Ria's clothes came off until
she was completely naked.

351
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:17,669
And then came the greatest shock of all, because
then I saw that there was something about

352
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:18,940
Ria that was different.

353
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,660
She was different from other girls.

354
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,650
And it wasn't only that she was a tram driver.

355
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,400
She was a man!

356
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
'Aaagh!'

357
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:46,700
I sort of screamed and moved quickly towards
the door.

358
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,230
'See what I mean?' said the big Dutch guy
behind me, laughing.

359
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,230
I ran outside.

360
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,230
The Dutch guy followed me, shouting, 'So,
you like our entertainment, do you, little

361
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,230
English boy?'

362
00:26:53,230 --> 00:27:00,175
A bit rude, I thought, calling me 'little',
but I thought I'd let it pass.

363
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:02,320
I ran as fast as I could.

364
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,610
I ran all the way back home.

365
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,930
I couldn't help thinking about what Hans had
said about 'strong women'.

366
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,820
He didn't know how right he was.

367
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
* * *

368
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,030
Yeah, there are times when life comes and
grabs you by the throat.

369
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,940
So, all that happened about six months ago.

370
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,409
Since then, things have, well, calmed down
a bit.

371
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:35,419
I get up every morning for work and I come
home every evening.

372
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:36,420
I make dinner.

373
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,520
I watch my favourite TV program on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

374
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,830
I go out, I come in.

375
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,220
I have a drink on a Friday night.

376
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,140
The highlight of my week is lunch out on Sundays.

377
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:57,159
OK, it's boring, but to tell the truth I kind
of like it.

378
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm happy.

379
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,870
But I'm really not looking forward to the
winter.

380
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,110
- THE END -
