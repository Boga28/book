1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,710
Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,480
ANTONIO

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,600
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,340
But how I caught it, found it, or came by
it,

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,090
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,980
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,980
SALARINO

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,080
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There, where your argosies with portly sail,

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,950
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,370
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,280
As they fly by them with their woven wings.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
SALANIO

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,539
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would

14
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,050
Be with my hopes abroad.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,969
I should be still
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the

16
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,180
wind,
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,240
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,780
Would make me sad.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
SALARINO

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,939
My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought

21
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,720
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,560
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
But I should think of shallows and of flats,

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,560
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,530
To kiss her burial.

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,079
Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,369
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,

27
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:49,050
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,270
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing?

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,850
Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,070
That such a thing bechanced would make me
sad?

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,409
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

32
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,409
ANTONIO

33
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:12,330
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,

34
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,269
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:

35
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,940
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,940
SALARINO

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,300
Why, then you are in love.

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
ANTONIO

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Fie, fie!

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
SALARINO

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,360
Not in love neither?

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Then let us say you are sad,
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,890
For you to laugh and leap and say you are
merry,

44
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,800
Because you are not sad.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,500
Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,350
time:
Some that will evermore peep through their

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,830
eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,900
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,349
smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

50
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,920
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
SALANIO

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,680
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano and Lorenzo.

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,160
Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
SALARINO

55
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,060
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
If worthier friends had not prevented me.

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
ANTONIO

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,510
Your worth is very dear in my regard.

58
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,689
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

59
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,689
SALARINO

60
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,500
Good morrow, my good lords.

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
BASSANIO

62
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,930
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?

63
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,099
say, when?

64
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,870
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

65
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
SALARINO

66
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,690
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

67
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,341
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio

68
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,629
LORENZO

69
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:54,950
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,

70
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,379
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

71
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,379
BASSANIO

72
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,379
I will not fail you.

73
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,379
GRATIANO

74
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:05,230
You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world:

75
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,670
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.

76
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,670
ANTONIO

77
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:18,030
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,

78
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,729
And mine a sad one.

79
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:20,729
GRATIANO

80
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,570
Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,

81
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,440
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.

82
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,050
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,199
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish?

84
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,510
I tell thee what, Antonio--
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,710
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,

86
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,880
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion

87
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,699
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,

88
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,770
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'

89
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,870
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise

90
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,790
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those

91
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,650
ears,
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers

92
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,650
fools.

93
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,749
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,

94
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:30,340
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.

95
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,990
Come, good Lorenzo.

96
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,010
Fare ye well awhile:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

97
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,010
LORENZO

98
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:44,120
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,

99
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,960
For Gratiano never lets me speak.

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
GRATIANO

101
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,560
Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own

102
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
tongue.

103
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
ANTONIO

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

105
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
GRATIANO

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,360
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,110
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO

108
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,110
ANTONIO

109
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,539
Is that any thing now?

110
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:09,539
BASSANIO

111
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,919
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,
more

112
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,539
than any man in all Venice.

113
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:21,439
His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff:

114
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,800
you
shall seek all day ere you find them, and

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,280
when you
have them, they are not worth the search.

116
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
ANTONIO

117
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,979
Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,

118
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,380
That you to-day promised to tell me of?

119
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
BASSANIO

120
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,330
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,

121
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:51,380
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:

122
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,520
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care

123
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal

124
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,930
Hath left me gaged.

125
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,190
To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,

126
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,930
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes

127
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,850
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

128
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
ANTONIO

129
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:28,150
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,

130
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,330
Within the eye of honour, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,

131
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,530
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

132
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,530
BASSANIO

133
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:45,110
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight

134
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,770
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring

135
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,990
both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,

136
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,310
Because what follows is pure innocence.

137
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:12,680
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please

138
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,560
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,319
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again

140
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

141
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
ANTONIO

142
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,640
You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,589
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost

144
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:47,089
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do

145
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:54,800
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

146
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
BASSANIO

147
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,250
In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,

148
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:12,160
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:

149
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,300
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:

150
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:26,560
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast

151
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,370
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;

152
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:41,019
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.

153
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:48,570
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,

154
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,050
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!

155
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,050
ANTONIO

156
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,779
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity

157
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:08,040
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,320
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.

159
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make

160
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,340
To have it of my trust or for my sake.

161
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
Exeunt

162
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
Scene 2

163
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Belmont.

164
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
A room in PORTIA'S house.

165
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,589
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA

166

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
SHYLOCK

340
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:03,780
Three thousand ducats for three months and
Antonio bound.

341
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,050
BASSANIO

342
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,610
Your answer to that.

343
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,610
SHYLOCK

344
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,360
Antonio is a good man.

345
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
BASSANIO

346
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,020
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

347
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
SHYLOCK

348
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,429
Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he
is a

349
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:28,720
good man is to have you understand me that
he is

350
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
sufficient.

351
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:40,100
Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another

352
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,890
to the
Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto,

353
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:54,090
he
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England,

354
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,370
and
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad.

355
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:07,870
But ships
are but boards, sailors but men: there be

356
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:16,590
land-rats
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves,

357
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:24,679
I
mean pirates, and then there is the peril

358
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:34,160
of waters,
winds and rocks.

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,450
The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient.

360
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,940
Three thousand ducats; I think I may
take his bond.

361
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
BASSANIO

362
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,850
Be assured you may.

363
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,850
SHYLOCK

364
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:52,960
I will be assured I may; and, that I may be
assured,

365
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,980
I will bethink me.

366
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,760
May I speak with Antonio?

367
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
BASSANIO

368
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,490
If it please you to dine with us.

369
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,940
SHYLOCK

370
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,610
Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation
which

371
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,440
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil
into.

372
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,929
I
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with

373
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,840
you,
walk with you, and so following, but I will

374
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,020
not eat
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.

375
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,750
What
news on the Rialto?

376
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,760
Who is he comes here?

377
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Enter ANTONIO

378
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
BASSANIO

379
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,830
This is Signior Antonio.

380
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,830
SHYLOCK

381
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,080
[Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!

382
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,590
I hate him for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity

383
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,670
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.

384
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,670
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear

385
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,710
him.

386
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:02,370
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,

387
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:09,299
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest.

388
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,150
Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!

389
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,150
BASSANIO

390
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,150
Shylock, do you hear?

391
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,150
SHYLOCK

392
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,520
I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,

393
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,419
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats.

394
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,260
What of that?

395
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,080
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me.

396
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,090
But soft!

397
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,840
how many months
Do you desire?

398
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
To ANTONIO

399
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,700
Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

400
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
ANTONIO

401
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,950
Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,

402
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,110
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom.

403
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,370
Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?

404
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,370
SHYLOCK

405
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,370
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

406
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,370
ANTONIO

407
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,370
And for three months.

408
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,370
SHYLOCK

409
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,809
I had forgot; three months; you told me so.

410
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:20,380
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but
hear you;

411
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,669
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.

412
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:25,669
ANTONIO

413
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:27,549
I do never use it.

414
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:28,549
SHYLOCK

415
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:35,450
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,

416
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,650
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--

417
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,650
ANTONIO

418
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,650
And what of him?

419
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,040
did he take interest?

420
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
SHYLOCK

421
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:53,909
No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.

422
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:59,759
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd

423
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,010
and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being

424
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,270
rank,
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,

425
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,850
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,

426
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:19,100
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,

427
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:26,590
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time

428
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,730
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were
Jacob's.

429
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,230
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

430
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,230
ANTONIO

431
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,430
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served
for;

432
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:46,620
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.

433
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,549
Was this inserted to make interest good?

434
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:52,460
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

435
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
SHYLOCK

436
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,799
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.

437
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,799
ANTONIO

438
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,299
Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.

439
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:11,419
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,

440
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:17,210
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

441
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,210
SHYLOCK

442
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,590
Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.

443
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,220
Three months from twelve; then, let me see;
the rate--

444
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
ANTONIO

445
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,750
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

446
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,750
SHYLOCK

447
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,380
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me

448
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,899
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,

449
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:42,090
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

450
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,170
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,

451
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,750
And all for use of that which is mine own.

452
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:59,201
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say

453
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:06,659
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard

454
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:12,539
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit

455
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,919
What should I say to you?

456
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,929
Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible

457
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:20,669
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?'

458
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,460
Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,

459
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,940
With bated breath and whispering humbleness,
Say this;

460
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:34,710
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time

461
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,070
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?

462
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,070
ANTONIO

463
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:47,080
I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.

464
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,159
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship

465
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,789
take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?

466
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:00,970
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face

467
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,110
Exact the penalty.

468
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,110
SHYLOCK

469
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,149
Why, look you, how you storm!

470
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,650
I would be friends with you and have your
love,

471
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,230
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me
with,

472
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,950
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear

473
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,679
me:
This is kind I offer.

474
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,679
BASSANIO

475
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,080
This were kindness.

476
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
SHYLOCK

477
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,440
This kindness will I show.

478
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,570
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,

479
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,799
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are

480
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,060
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound

481
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,650
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

482
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
ANTONIO

483
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:57,039
Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

484
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,039
BASSANIO

485
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,570
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

486
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,570
ANTONIO

487
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,799
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before

488
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,240
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

489
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
SHYLOCK

490
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,710
O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect

491
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,500
The thoughts of others!

492
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I

493
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,630
gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?

494
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:40,880
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,

495
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,690
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

496
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,160
I say,
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:

497
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:55,640
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

498
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
ANTONIO

499
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,940
Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

500
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
SHYLOCK

501
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,640
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,

502
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,960
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard

503
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,970
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I will be with you.

504
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,970
ANTONIO

505
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,470
Hie thee, gentle Jew.

506
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,470
Exit Shylock

507
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,500
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

508
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
BASSANIO

509
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,750
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

510
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,750
ANTONIO

511
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:49,360
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before 

512
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
the day.

513
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Exeunt

514
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
ACT 2

515
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Scene 1

516
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Belmont.

517
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,450
A room in PORTIA'S house.

518
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:08,159
Flourish of cornets.

519
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:17,980
Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train;
PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending

520
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,040
MOROCCO

521
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,240
Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,

522
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,559
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

523
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,500
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,

524
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,370
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.

525
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:46,250
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear

526
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,539
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too: I would not change this

527
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,850
hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

528
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,850
PORTIA

529
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:01,460
In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;

530
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,299
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:

531
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:10,410
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself

532
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,870
His wife who wins me by that means I told
you,

533
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:19,179
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
As any comer I have look'd on yet

534
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,330
For my affection.

535
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,330
MOROCCO

536
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:25,130
Even for that I thank you:
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets

537
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,789
To try my fortune.

538
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:30,409
By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince

539
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:37,289
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,

540
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:42,710
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,

541
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:48,460
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
To win thee, lady.

542
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,279
But, alas the while!

543
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,149
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man, the greater throw

544
00:30:55,149 --> 00:31:01,230
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;

545
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:08,240
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,

546
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,330
And die with grieving.

547
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,330
PORTIA

548
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,830
You must take your chance,
And either not attempt to choose at all

549
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,799
Or swear before you choose, if you choose
wrong

550
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,419
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.

551
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,419
MOROCCO

552
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:23,470
Nor will not.

553
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,690
Come, bring me unto my chance.

554
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,690
PORTIA

555
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,130
First, forward to the temple: after dinner
Your hazard shall be made.

556
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,130
MOROCCO

557
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,130
Good fortune then!

558
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,360
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.

559
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,910
Cornets, and exeunt

560
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,910
Scene 2

561
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,910
Venice.

562
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,910
A street.

563
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,910
Enter LAUNCELOT

564
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,910
LAUNCELOT

565
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,910
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run
from

566
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,320
this Jew my master.

567
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:55,370
The fiend is at mine elbow and
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo,

568
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,990
good
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot

569
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:07,779
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run
away.

570
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:12,730
My
conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;

571
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,500
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid,
'honest

572
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,990
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running
with thy

573
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,059
heels.'

574
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:35,460
Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says

575
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,570
the
fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave

576
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,090
mind,'
says the fiend, 'and run.'

577
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:52,630
Well, my conscience,
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very

578
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:58,049
wisely
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an

579
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:03,740
honest
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son;

580
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,490
for,
indeed, my father did something smack, something

581
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:20,080
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my
conscience

582
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,429
says 'Launcelot, budge not.'

583
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,950
'Budge,' says the
fiend.

584
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,110
'Budge not,' says my conscience.

585
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:41,720
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by

586
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,601
my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my

587
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:50,779
master,
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil;

588
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:55,179
and, to
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by

589
00:33:55,179 --> 00:34:02,820
the
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the

590
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,980
devil
himself.

591
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:13,429
Certainly the Jew is the very devil
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience

592
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,500
is
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to

593
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,909
counsel
me to stay with the Jew.

594
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:30,060
The fiend gives the more
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels

595
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,550
are
at your command; I will run.

596
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,550
Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket

597
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,609
GOBBO

598
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,659
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is
the way

599
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,430
to master Jew's?

600
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,430
LAUNCELOT

601
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:49,040
[Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten
father!

602
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,679
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel
blind,

603
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,350
knows me not: I will try confusions with him.

604
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,350
GOBBO

605
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,750
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which
is the way

606
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,869
to master Jew's?

607
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,869
LAUNCELOT

608
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:11,140
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning,
but,

609
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,820
at the next turning of all, on your left;
marry, at

610
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,600
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but
turn

611
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,270
down indirectly to the Jew's house.

612
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,270
GOBBO

613
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,310
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to
hit.

614
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,050
Can
you tell me whether one Launcelot,

615
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,349
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?

616
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:37,369
LAUNCELOT

617
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,840
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

618
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Aside

619
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,990
Mark me now; now will I raise the waters.

620
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,380
Talk you
of young Master Launcelot?

621
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,380
GOBBO

622
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,720
No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his
father,

623
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,790
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor
man

624
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,950
and, God be thanked, well to live.

625
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,950
LAUNCELOT

626
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,990
Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk
of

627
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,960
young Master Launcelot.

628
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
GOBBO

629
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,670
Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.

630
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,670
LAUNCELOT

631
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,640
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech
you,

632
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,720
talk you of young Master Launcelot?

633
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,740
GOBBO

634
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,030
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.

635
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,060
LAUNCELOT

636
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,170
Ergo, Master Launcelot.

637
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,849
Talk not of Master
Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,

638
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:42,740
according to Fates and Destinies and such
odd

639
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:49,020
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches
of

640
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,180
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would
say

641
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,670
in plain terms, gone to heaven.

642
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,670
GOBBO

643
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,460
Marry, God forbid!

644
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,150
the boy was the very staff of my
age, my very prop.

645
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,150
LAUNCELOT

646
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,550
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a
staff or

647
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,849
a prop?

648
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,880
Do you know me, father?

649
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
GOBBO

650
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,420
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest

651
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,630
his
soul, alive or dead?

652
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,630
LAUNCELOT

653
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,160
Do you not know me, father?

654
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
GOBBO

655
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,329
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.

656
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,329
LAUNCELOT

657
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,090
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might
fail of

658
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,780
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows
his

659
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,320
own child.

660
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:55,730
Well, old man, I will tell you news of
your son: give me your blessing: truth will

661
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,870
come
to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's

662
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,070
son
may, but at the length truth will out.

663
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
GOBBO

664
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,760
Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are
not

665
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,560
Launcelot, my boy.

666
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
LAUNCELOT

667
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,859
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about
it, but

668
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:20,060
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your
boy

669
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,511
that was, your son that is, your child that
shall

670
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,511
be.

671
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,511
GOBBO

672
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,770
I cannot think you are my son.

673
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,770
LAUNCELOT

674
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,220
I know not what I shall think of that: but
I am

675
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,400
Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery
your

676
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
wife is my mother.

677
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
GOBBO

678
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,829
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn,
if thou

679
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:47,849
be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and
blood.

680
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,740
Lord worshipped might he be!

681
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,310
what a beard hast thou
got!

682
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:58,250
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

683
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,250
LAUNCELOT

684
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:06,550
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
backward: I am sure he had more hair of his

685
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,650
tail
than I have of my face when I last saw him.

686
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,650
GOBBO

687
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,380
Lord, how art thou changed!

688
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,030
How dost thou and thy
master agree?

689
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,390
I have brought him a present.

690
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,520
How
'gree you now?

691
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
LAUNCELOT

692
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,290
Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have
set

693
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,830
up my rest to run away, so I will not rest
till I

694
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,470
have run some ground.

695
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:38,690
My master's a very Jew: give
him a present!

696
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:48,230
give him a halter: I am famished in
his service; you may tell every finger I have

697
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,460
with
my ribs.

698
00:39:49,460 --> 00:40:00,360
Father, I am glad you are come: give me
your present to one Master Bassanio, who,

699
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,920
indeed,
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him,

700
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,619
I
will run as far as God has any ground.

701
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,260
O rare
fortune!

702
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:21,150
here comes the man: to him, father; for I
am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.

703
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,200
Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers

704
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
BASSANIO

705
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that
supper

706
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,970
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.

707
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,550
See
these letters delivered; put the liveries

708
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,599
to making,
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

709
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,930
Exit a Servant

710
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,930
LAUNCELOT

711
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,930
To him, father.

712
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,930
GOBBO

713
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,930
God bless your worship!

714
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,930
BASSANIO

715
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,930
Gramercy!

716
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,930
wouldst thou aught with me?

717
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,930
GOBBO

718
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,550
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--

719
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,550
LAUNCELOT

720
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,060
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man;
that

721
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,490
would, sir, as my father shall specify--

722
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,490
GOBBO

723
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,770
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would
say, to serve--

724
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,770
LAUNCELOT

725
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,720
Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve
the Jew,

726
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,329
and have a desire, as my father shall specify--

727
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:16,380
GOBBO

728
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,569
His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
are scarce cater-cousins--

729
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:23,630
LAUNCELOT

730
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,900
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew,
having

731
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,150
done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father,
being, I

732
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,290
hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--

733
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,290
GOBBO

734
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,820
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow
upon

735
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,770
your worship, and my suit is--

736
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,770
LAUNCELOT

737
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:53,170
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to
myself, as

738
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,030
your worship shall know by this honest old
man; and,

739
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:03,650
though I say it, though old man, yet poor
man, my father.

740
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,119
BASSANIO

741
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,840
One speak for both.

742
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
What would you?

743
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
LAUNCELOT

744
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Serve you, sir.

745
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
GOBBO

746
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,630
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

747
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,630
BASSANIO

748
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:21,339
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,

749
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:26,700
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become

750
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,110
The follower of so poor a gentleman.

751
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,110
LAUNCELOT

752
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,270
The old proverb is very well parted between
my

753
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,510
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the
grace of

754
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,099
God, sir, and he hath enough.

755
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,099
BASSANIO

756
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,920
Thou speak'st it well.

757
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,400
Go, father, with thy son.

758
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,880
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out.

759
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,940
Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

760
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
LAUNCELOT

761
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,980
Father, in.

762
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:09,460
I cannot get a service, no; I have
ne'er a tongue in my head.

763
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,710
Well, if any man in
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer

764
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,260
to swear
upon a book, I shall have good fortune.

765
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:24,310
Go to,
here's a simple line of life: here's a small

766
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:29,660
trifle
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing!

767
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:37,960
eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in

768
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,950
for one
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and

769
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:50,080
to be
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;

770
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,300
here are simple scapes.

771
00:43:52,300 --> 00:44:00,310
Well, if Fortune be a
woman, she's a good wench for this gear.

772
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,700
Father,
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the

773
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,920
twinkling of an eye.

774
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,450
Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo

775
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,450
BASSANIO

776
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,780
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,

777
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:20,550
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

778
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,550
LEONARDO

779
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,579
My best endeavours shall be done herein.

780
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:27,730
Enter GRATIANO

781
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,730
GRATIANO

782
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,730
Where is your master?

783
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,730
LEONARDO

784
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,730
Yonder, sir, he walks.

785
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,730
Exit

786
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,730
GRATIANO

787
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,730
Signior Bassanio!

788
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,730
BASSANIO

789
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,730
Gratiano!

790
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,730
GRATIANO

791
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,730
I have a suit to you.

792
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,730
BASSANIO

793
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:40,730
You have obtain'd it.

794
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,730
GRATIANO

795
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,730
You must not deny me: I must go with you to
Belmont.

796
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,730
BASSANIO

797
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,290
Why then you must.

798
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:52,730
But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;

799
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:58,590
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;

800
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:03,341
But where thou art not known, why, there they
show

801
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:05,940
Something too liberal.

802
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,410
Pray thee, take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty

803
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,720
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild
behavior

804
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,300
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.

805
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,300
GRATIANO

806
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,349
Signior Bassanio, hear me:
If I do not put on a sober habit,

807
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:31,430
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,

808
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,970
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine
eyes

809
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:42,460
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
Use all the observance of civility,

810
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:48,350
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam, never trust me more.

811
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,350
BASSANIO

812
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,079
Well, we shall see your bearing.

813
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,079
GRATIANO

814
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,180
Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge
me

815
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,930
By what we do to-night.

816
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,930
BASSANIO

817
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,240
No, that were pity:
I would entreat you rather to put on

818
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:08,210
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment.

819
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,710
But fare you well:
I have some business.

820
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,710
GRATIANO

821
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,450
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
But we will visit you at supper-time.

822
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,450
Exeunt

823
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,640
Scene 3

824
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
The same.

825
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
A room in SHYLOCK'S house.

826
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT

827
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,640
JESSICA

828
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,530
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,

829
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,470
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.

830
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:34,559
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou

831
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,819
see
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:

832
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:43,600
Give him this letter; do it secretly;
And so farewell: I would not have my father

833
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,809
See me in talk with thee.

834
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:46,809
LAUNCELOT

835
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,809
Adieu!

836
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:50,300
tears exhibit my tongue.

837
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,650
Most beautiful
pagan, most sweet Jew!

838
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:00,640
if a Christian did not play
the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.

839
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:08,160
But,
adieu: these foolish drops do something drown

840
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,820
my
manly spirit: adieu.

841
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,820
JESSICA

842
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,020
Farewell, good Launcelot.

843
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,119
Exit Launcelot

844
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:22,650
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my father's child!

845
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:27,040
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners.

846
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,720
O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,

847
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,000
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.

848
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000

A street.

Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,

00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,010
All in an hour.

GRATIANO

SALARINO

859
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,550
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,550
SALANIO

861
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,890

Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter

865
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,220
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

LAUNCELOT

867
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:16,720
An it shall please you to break up
this, it shall seem to signify.

868

LORENZO

869
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,589
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on

870
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,620
Is the fair hand that writ.

GRATIANO

LAUNCELOT

00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,600

LAUNCELOT

Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the

Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her; speak it privately.

Go, gentlemen,

Exit Launcelot

Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?

I am provided of a torch-bearer.

SALANIO

SALANIO

889
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,020

LORENZO

898
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,150
I must needs tell thee all.

899
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,070
She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house,

900
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:29,450
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
What page's suit she hath in readiness.

901
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:36,670
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:

902
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:43,349
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
Unless she do it under this excuse,

903
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:47,520
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.

Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.

The same.

Before SHYLOCK'S house.

909

SHYLOCK

911
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:05,900
Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy
judge,

912
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:13,250
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,

913
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:22,150
As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--

914
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,980
Why, Jessica, I say!

00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,980
LAUNCELOT

SHYLOCK

00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,069
Who bids thee call?

919
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,280
I do not bid thee call.

920
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,280
LAUNCELOT

921
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,849
Your worship was wont to tell me that
I could do nothing without bidding.

922
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:37,849
Enter Jessica

923
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:38,849
JESSICA

00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:39,849
Call you?

925
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:40,849
what is your will?

926
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:41,849
SHYLOCK

927
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:45,360
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
There are my keys.

928
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
But wherefore should I go?

929
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:55,400
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon

930
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,809
The prodigal Christian.

931
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:02,339
Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house.

932
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:08,589
I am right loath to go:
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,

933
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:11,829
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

934
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:12,829
LAUNCELOT

935
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:18,200
I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth
expect

936
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,589
your reproach.

937
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:20,589
SHYLOCK

938
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:22,049
So do I his.

939
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:23,049
LAUNCELOT

940
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:27,880
An they have conspired together, I will not
say you

941
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,280
shall see a masque; but if you do, then it
was not

942
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:43,270
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,

943
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:47,910
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was
four

944
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,650
year, in the afternoon.

945
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,650
SHYLOCK

946
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,069
What, are there masques?

947
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:59,740
Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum

948
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:07,559
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
Clamber not you up to the casements then,

949
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:14,200
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd

950
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:21,640
faces,
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:

951
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,220
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house.

952
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:34,280
By Jacob's staff, I swear,
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:

953
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,390
But I will go.

954
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,559
Go you before me, sirrah;
Say I will come.

955
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:40,559
LAUNCELOT

956
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,040
I will go before, sir.

957
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,470
Mistress, look out at
window, for all this, There will come a Christian

958
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,930
boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

959
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,930
Exit

960
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:53,930
SHYLOCK

961
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,890
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring,
ha?

962
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,890
JESSICA

963
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,280
His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing
else.

964
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
SHYLOCK

965
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:08,799
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day

966
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:13,619
More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with
me;

967
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:19,200
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that would have him help to waste

968
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880
His borrow'd purse.

969
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,430
Well, Jessica, go in;
Perhaps I will return immediately:

970
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:34,699
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
Fast bind, fast find;

971
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:37,829
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

972
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:38,829
Exit

973
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:39,829
JESSICA

974
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:44,040
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

975
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Exit

976
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Scene 6

977
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
The same.

978
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,589
Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued

979
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:49,589
GRATIANO

980
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:52,660
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.

981
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,660
SALARINO

982
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,040
His hour is almost past.

983
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
GRATIANO

984
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,190
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.

985
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,190
SALARINO

986
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:08,250
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are

987
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,780
wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

988
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
GRATIANO

989
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:17,299
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?

990
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:22,280
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire

991
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,720
That he did pace them first?

992
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,859
All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.

993
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:33,140
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,

994
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,480
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!

995
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,619
How like the prodigal doth she return,
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,

996
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:45,820
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

997
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,380
SALARINO

998
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,420
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

999
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,420
Enter LORENZO

1000
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,420
LORENZO

1001
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:59,380
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:

1002
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,960
When you shall please to play the thieves
for wives,

1003
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,890
I'll watch as long for you then.

1004
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,030
Approach;
Here dwells my father Jew.

1005
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,030
Ho!

1006
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,030
who's within?

1007
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,359
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes

1008
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:15,359
JESSICA

1009
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,460
Who are you?

1010
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:22,200
Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

1011
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,200
LORENZO

1012
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,660
Lorenzo, and thy love.

1013
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,660
JESSICA

1014
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:30,109
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much?

1015
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:35,480
And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

1016
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
LORENZO

1017
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,770
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou
art.

1018
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,770
JESSICA

1019
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,820
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.

1020
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:48,850
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:

1021
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:54,160
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit;

1022
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,480
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

1023
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,480
LORENZO

1024
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,839
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

1025
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,839
JESSICA

1026
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,930
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?

1027
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,260
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too
light.

1028
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,060
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
And I should be obscured.

1029
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,060
LORENZO

1030
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:21,540
So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

1031
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,290
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,

1032
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,920
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

1033
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
JESSICA

1034
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,160
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

1035
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
Exit above

1036
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
GRATIANO

1037
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,030
Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

1038
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,030
LORENZO

1039
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:46,520
Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,

1040
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:52,920
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,

1041
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,829
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and
true,

1042
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:03,049
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

1043
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,539
Enter JESSICA, below

1044
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:07,089
What, art thou come?

1045
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,000
On, gentlemen; away!

1046
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,530
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

1047
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,250
Exit with Jessica and Salarino

1048
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,250
Enter ANTONIO

1049
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,250
ANTONIO

1050
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,299
Who's there?

1051
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,299
GRATIANO

1052
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:22,299
Signior Antonio!

1053
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:23,299
ANTONIO

1054
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:24,299
Fie, fie, Gratiano!

1055
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:25,299
where are all the rest?

1056
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:28,820
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for
you.

1057
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:34,960
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:

1058
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,400
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

1059
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
GRATIANO

1060
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,700
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

1061
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,700
Exeunt

1062
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,700
Scene 7

1063
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Belmont.

1064
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1065
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Flourish of cornets.

1066
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,079
Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO,
and their trains

1067
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,079
PORTIA

1068
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:53,630
Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.

1069
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,450
Now make your choice.

1070
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,450
MOROCCO

1071
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:02,440
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men

1072
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,300
desire;'
The second, silver, which this promise carries,

1073
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:15,150
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
This third, dull lead, with warning all as

1074
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,900
blunt,
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all

1075
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,609
he hath.'

1076
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:22,990
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

1077
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:23,990
PORTIA

1078
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:29,010
The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

1079
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,010
MOROCCO

1080
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,849
Some god direct my judgment!

1081
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:36,809
Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.

1082
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:38,500
What says this leaden casket?

1083
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:43,260
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all
he hath.'

1084
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,700
Must give: for what? for lead?

1085
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,580
hazard for lead?

1086
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,470
This casket threatens.

1087
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,390
Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:

1088
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:59,960
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.

1089
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,750
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

1090
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,859
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'

1091
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,260
As much as he deserves!

1092
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,359
Pause there, Morocco,
And weigh thy value with an even hand:

1093
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,780
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough

1094
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,250
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving

1095
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,289
Were but a weak disabling of myself.

1096
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:28,880
As much as I deserve!

1097
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,940
Why, that's the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

1098
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:40,339
In graces and in qualities of breeding;
But more than these, in love I do deserve.

1099
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:44,580
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?

1100
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,930
Let's see once more this saying graved in
gold

1101
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:50,430
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men
desire.'

1102
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:54,700
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires
her;

1103
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,349
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing

1104
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:03,630
saint:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds

1105
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:10,220
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:

1106
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,770
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar

1107
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:20,890
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.

1108
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,599
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.

1109
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,080
Is't like that lead contains her?

1110
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,990
'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross

1111
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,640
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.

1112
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:39,349
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?

1113
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,670
O sinful thought!

1114
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,530
Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold.

1115
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:48,240
They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel

1116
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,960
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed

1117
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,589
Lies all within.

1118
01:00:55,589 --> 01:01:01,720
Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

1119
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
PORTIA

1120
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,910
There, take it, prince; and if my form lie
there,

1121
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,910
Then I am yours.

1122
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,119
He unlocks the golden casket

1123
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:09,119
MOROCCO

1124
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,119
O hell!

1125
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:11,119
what have we here?

1126
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,100
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll!

1127
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,100
I'll read the writing.

1128
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,100
Reads

1129
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:22,470
All that glitters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:

1130
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,460
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:

1131
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,980
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

1132
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,630
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgment old,

1133
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:40,589
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
Fare you well; your suit is cold.

1134
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:47,070
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!

1135
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,250
Portia, adieu.

1136
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:55,029
I have too grieved a heart
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

1137
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,329
Exit with his train.

1138
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:58,430
Flourish of cornets

1139
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,430
PORTIA

1140
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,230
A gentle riddance.

1141
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,590
Draw the curtains, go.

1142
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,980
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

1143
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,980
Exeunt

1144
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,980
Scene 8

1145
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,980
Venice.

1146
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,980
A street.

1147
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,980
Enter SALARINO and SALANIO

1148
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,980
SALARINO

1149
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:15,690
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
With him is Gratiano gone along;

1150
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:19,130
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

1151
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,130
SALANIO

1152
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:25,430
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

1153
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,430
SALARINO

1154
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:31,720
He came too late, the ship was under sail:
But there the duke was given to understand

1155
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:38,099
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:

1156
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:43,930
Besides, Antonio certified the duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

1157
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:44,930
SALANIO

1158
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:49,950
I never heard a passion so confused,
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,

1159
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,270
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
'My daughter!

1160
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,430
O my ducats!

1161
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,119
O my daughter!

1162
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:57,119
Fled with a Christian!

1163
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,280
O my Christian ducats!

1164
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,280
Justice!

1165
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
the law!

1166
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,599
my ducats, and my daughter!

1167
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:09,490
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!

1168
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:13,529
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious
stones,

1169
01:03:13,529 --> 01:03:15,130
Stolen by my daughter!

1170
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,130
Justice!

1171
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,350
find the girl;
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

1172
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,350
SALARINO

1173
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:25,180
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his

1174
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,180
ducats.

1175
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,180
SALANIO

1176
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,030
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this.

1177
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,030
SALARINO

1178
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,250
Marry, well remember'd.

1179
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:38,270
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part

1180
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:43,180
The French and English, there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught:

1181
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:49,060
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

1182
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,060
SALANIO

1183
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:55,430
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

1184
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,430
SALARINO

1185
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,680
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.

1186
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:04,809
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed

1187
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:10,971
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio

1188
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:17,380
But stay the very riping of the time;
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,

1189
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:22,720
Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts

1190
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,890
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there:'

1191
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:36,410
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,

1192
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:42,680
And with affection wondrous sensible
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

1193
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,680
SALANIO

1194
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,799
I think he only loves the world for him.

1195
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:50,369
I pray thee, let us go and find him out
And quicken his embraced heaviness

1196
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,039
With some delight or other.

1197
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:53,039
SALARINO

1198
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,480
Do we so.

1199
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,480
Exeunt

1200
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,480
Scene 9

1201
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,480
Belmont.

1202
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,480
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1203
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Enter NERISSA with a Servitor

1204
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
NERISSA

1205
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,770
Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain
straight:

1206
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:06,010
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.

1207
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,349
Flourish of cornets.

1208
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:09,041
Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their
trains

1209
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,041
PORTIA

1210
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:19,680
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,

1211
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,220
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,

1212
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,119
You must be gone from hence immediately.

1213
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,119
ARRAGON

1214
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:34,549
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one

1215
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:41,880
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life

1216
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:48,140
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,

1217
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,520
Immediately to leave you and be gone.

1218
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,520
PORTIA

1219
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,799
To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

1220
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:56,799
ARRAGON

1221
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,710
And so have I address'd me.

1222
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,390
Fortune now
To my heart's hope!

1223
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,839
Gold; silver; and base lead.

1224
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:11,690
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all
he hath.'

1225
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,619
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.

1226
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,359
What says the golden chest?

1227
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:22,910
ha! let me see:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men

1228
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,650
desire.'

1229
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,990
What many men desire!

1230
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:32,240
that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,

1231
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,200
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior, but, like

1232
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,170
the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,

1233
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,150
Even in the force and road of casualty.

1234
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:50,170
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits

1235
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,360
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.

1236
01:06:52,360 --> 01:07:01,770
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:

1237
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:10,349
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about

1238
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:14,270
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit?

1239
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:18,700
Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.

1240
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:24,950
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear

1241
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:28,390
honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!

1242
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,600
How many then should cover that stand bare!

1243
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,760
How many be commanded that command!

1244
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,820
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honour! and how much

1245
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,349
honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times

1246
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:45,349
To be new-varnish'd!

1247
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:52,619
Well, but to my choice:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'

1248
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:54,809
I will assume desert.

1249
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:58,839
Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

1250
01:07:58,839 --> 01:07:59,839
He opens the silver casket

1251
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:00,839
PORTIA

1252
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:01,850
Too long a pause for that which you find there.

1253
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,850
ARRAGON

1254
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:03,850
What's here?

1255
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:08,140
the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule!

1256
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,160
I will read it.

1257
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,940
How much unlike art thou to Portia!

1258
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,150
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!

1259
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:20,560
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he
deserves.'

1260
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,540
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

1261
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,319
Is that my prize?

1262
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,140
are my deserts no better?

1263
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,140
PORTIA

1264
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,799
To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
And of opposed natures.

1265
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:32,799
ARRAGON

1266
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:33,799
What is here?

1267
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:34,799
Reads

1268
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:40,700
The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgment is,

1269
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,040
That did never choose amiss.

1270
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,390
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:

1271
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:55,580
There be fools alive, I wis,
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.

1272
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:59,540
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:

1273
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:03,450
So be gone: you are sped.

1274
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:07,390
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here

1275
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:11,560
With one fool's head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.

1276
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,310
Sweet, adieu.

1277
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:17,420
I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.

1278
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,580
Exeunt Arragon and train

1279
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,580
PORTIA

1280
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,440
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.

1281
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,000
O, these deliberate fools!

1282
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,640
when they do choose,
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

1283
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,640
NERISSA

1284
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:37,040
The ancient saying is no heresy,
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

1285
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,040
PORTIA

1286
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,609
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.

1287
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,609
Enter a Servant

1288
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:42,609
Servant

1289
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:43,609
Where is my lady?

1290
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:44,609
PORTIA

1291
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:45,609
Here: what would my lord?

1292
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:46,609
Servant

1293
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:48,270
Madam, there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian, one that comes before

1294
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:53,759
To signify the approaching of his lord;
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,

1295
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,280
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
Gifts of rich value.

1296
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,585
Yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love:

1297
01:09:59,585 --> 01:10:06,510
A day in April never came so sweet,
To show how costly summer was at hand,

1298
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,929
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

1299
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:09,929
PORTIA

1300
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:15,810
No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,

1301
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,800
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising
him.

1302
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:25,870
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

1303
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,870
NERISSA

1304
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:31,920
Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!

1305
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
Exeunt

1306
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:39,050
ACT 3

1307
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:45,990
Scene 1

1308
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,460
Venice.

1309
01:10:49,460 --> 01:11:04,489
A street.

1310
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:06,830
Enter SALANIO and SALARINO

1311
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:07,830
SALANIO

1312
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,210
Now, what news on the Rialto?

1313
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,210
SALARINO

1314
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:13,620
Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio
hath

1315
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,940
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow
seas;

1316
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,540
the Goodwins, I think they call the place;
a very

1317
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,000
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses
of many

1318
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,360
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my
gossip

1319
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,000
Report be an honest woman of her word.

1320
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
SALANIO

1321
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,580
I would she were as lying a gossip in that
as ever

1322
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,530
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe
she

1323
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:39,280
wept for the death of a third husband.

1324
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,970
But it is
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing

1325
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,380
the
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,

1326
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,570
the
honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good

1327
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,600
enough
to keep his name company!--

1328
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
SALARINO

1329
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,010
Come, the full stop.

1330
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,010
SALANIO

1331
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,010
Ha!

1332
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,010
what sayest thou?

1333
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,210
Why, the end is, he hath
lost a ship.

1334
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,210
SALARINO

1335
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,450
I would it might prove the end of his losses.

1336
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,450
SALANIO

1337
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,630
Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil
cross my

1338
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,540
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness
of a Jew.

1339
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,540
Enter SHYLOCK

1340
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,540
How now, Shylock!

1341
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,440
what news among the merchants?

1342
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,780
SHYLOCK

1343
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:19,000
You know, none so well, none so well as you,
of my

1344
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,010
daughter's flight.

1345
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,010
SALARINO

1346
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:25,940
That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
that made the wings she flew withal.

1347
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,940
SALANIO

1348
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,820
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird
was

1349
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,120
fledged; and then it is the complexion of
them all

1350
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,620
to leave the dam.

1351
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,620
SHYLOCK

1352
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,860
She is damned for it.

1353
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,860
SALANIO

1354
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,860
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.

1355
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,860
SHYLOCK

1356
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,650
My own flesh and blood to rebel!

1357
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,650
SALANIO

1358
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,060
Out upon it, old carrion!

1359
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,770
rebels it at these years?

1360
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,770
SHYLOCK

1361
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:54,199
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.

1362
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,199
SALARINO

1363
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,231
There is more difference between thy flesh
and hers

1364
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:01,730
than between jet and ivory; more between your
bloods

1365
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:05,130
than there is between red wine and rhenish.

1366
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,739
But
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have

1367
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:10,150
had any
loss at sea or no?

1368
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,150
SHYLOCK

1369
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:15,460
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt,
a

1370
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,620
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on
the

1371
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:26,020
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so
smug upon

1372
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:29,949
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to

1373
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:33,679
call me usurer; let him look to his bond:
he was

1374
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,650
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy;
let him

1375
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,460
look to his bond.

1376
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,460
SALARINO

1377
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,390
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not
take

1378
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:46,429
his flesh: what's that good for?

1379
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:47,429
SHYLOCK

1380
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:52,130
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing
else,

1381
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:55,590
it will feed my revenge.

1382
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:02,580
He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million; laughed at my

1383
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:09,199
losses,
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted

1384
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,650
my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine

1385
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,210
enemies; and what's his reason?

1386
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,250
I am a Jew.

1387
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:24,450
Hath
not a Jew eyes?

1388
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:34,400
hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions?

1389
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:40,340
fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons,

1390
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:46,770
subject
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,

1391
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:49,989
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer,
as

1392
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:53,540
a Christian is?

1393
01:14:53,540 --> 01:15:00,310
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh?

1394
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:05,870
if you poison
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall

1395
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,790
we not
revenge?

1396
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:13,520
If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that.

1397
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,380
If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility?

1398
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,380
Revenge.

1399
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:25,130
If a Christian
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be

1400
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,800
by
Christian example?

1401
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,469
Why, revenge.

1402
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:34,550
The villany you
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go

1403
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:38,530
hard but I
will better the instruction.

1404
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,239
Enter a Servant

1405
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,239
Servant

1406
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:44,330
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house
and

1407
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,590
desires to speak with you both.

1408
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:47,590
SALARINO

1409
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,150
We have been up and down to seek him.

1410
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,159
Enter TUBAL

1411
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:52,159
SALANIO

1412
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,870
Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot
be

1413
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,480
matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.

1414
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,200
Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant

1415
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,200
SHYLOCK

1416
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,670
How now, Tubal!

1417
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,670
what news from Genoa?

1418
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:05,199
hast thou
found my daughter?

1419
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,199
TUBAL

1420
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:09,800
I often came where I did hear of her, but
cannot find her.

1421
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
SHYLOCK

1422
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,810
Why, there, there, there, there!

1423
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,960
a diamond gone,
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort!

1424
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,620
The curse
never fell upon our nation till now; I never

1425
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:27,011
felt it
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and

1426
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:31,260
other
precious, precious jewels.

1427
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:35,060
I would my daughter
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her

1428
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,659
ear!
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the

1429
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:39,940
ducats in
her coffin!

1430
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,219
No news of them?

1431
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:45,949
Why, so: and I know
not what's spent in the search: why, thou

1432
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:47,760
loss upon
loss!

1433
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:55,380
the thief gone with so much, and so much to
find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:

1434
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:58,500
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on
my

1435
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:03,760
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no
tears

1436
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,170
but of my shedding.

1437
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,239
TUBAL

1438
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:11,300
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio,
as I

1439
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,640
heard in Genoa,--

1440
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,640
SHYLOCK

1441
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,719
What, what, what?

1442
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,800
ill luck, ill luck?

1443
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
TUBAL

1444
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,989
Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.

1445
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:21,989
SHYLOCK

1446
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:24,060
I thank God, I thank God.

1447
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,370
Is't true, is't true?

1448
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,370
TUBAL

1449
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,050
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped
the wreck.

1450
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,050
SHYLOCK

1451
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,320
I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good
news!

1452
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,610
ha, ha! where?

1453
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:35,610
in Genoa?

1454
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:36,610
TUBAL

1455
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,090
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard,
in one

1456
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:41,199
night fourscore ducats.

1457
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,199
SHYLOCK

1458
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:46,360
Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never
see my

1459
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,780
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!

1460
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,040
fourscore ducats!

1461
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,040
TUBAL

1462
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,360
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in
my

1463
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,400
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose
but break.

1464
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
SHYLOCK

1465
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,960
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll
torture

1466
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,790
him: I am glad of it.

1467
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,790
TUBAL

1468
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,920
One of them showed me a ring that he had of
your

1469
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,930
daughter for a monkey.

1470
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,930
SHYLOCK

1471
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:11,930
Out upon her!

1472
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:17,930
Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:

1473
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,940
I would not have given it for a wilderness
of monkeys.

1474
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,940
TUBAL

1475
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,260
But Antonio is certainly undone.

1476
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,260
SHYLOCK

1477
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,880
Nay, that's true, that's very true.

1478
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,510
Go, Tubal, fee
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before.

1479
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:36,620
I
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit;

1480
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,100
for, were
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise

1481
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,100
I
will.

1482
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:44,920
Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.

1483
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,920
Exeunt

1484
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,920
Scene 2

1485
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,920
Belmont.

1486
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,920
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1487
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,920
Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA,
and Attendants

1488
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,920
PORTIA

1489
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:58,490
I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,

1490
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,600
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.

1491
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,020
There's something tells me, but it is not
love,

1492
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:11,820
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.

1493
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:17,640
But lest you should not understand me well,--
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--

1494
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,790
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me.

1495
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:27,590
I could teach you
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;

1496
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:35,460
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,

1497
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,560
That I had been forsworn.

1498
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:42,199
Beshrew your eyes,
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;

1499
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:51,090
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,

1500
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,400
And so all yours.

1501
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:58,210
O, these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights!

1502
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,889
And so, though yours, not yours.

1503
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:04,650
Prove it so,
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.

1504
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:11,520
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,

1505
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,310
To stay you from election.

1506
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,310
BASSANIO

1507
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,010
Let me choose
For as I am, I live upon the rack.

1508
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,010
PORTIA

1509
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:20,710
Upon the rack, Bassanio!

1510
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:23,740
then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love.

1511
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,740
BASSANIO

1512
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:30,199
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:

1513
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:37,420
There may as well be amity and life
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

1514
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,420
PORTIA

1515
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,389
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
Where men enforced do speak anything.

1516
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:44,389
BASSANIO

1517
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,639
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

1518
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:47,639
PORTIA

1519
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,570
Well then, confess and live.

1520
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:50,570
BASSANIO

1521
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:55,930
'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession:

1522
01:20:55,930 --> 01:21:02,949
O happy torment, when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!

1523
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:06,199
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

1524
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:07,199
PORTIA

1525
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,200
Away, then!

1526
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:13,290
I am lock'd in one of them:
If you do love me, you will find me out.

1527
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,239
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.

1528
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:22,200
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,

1529
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:27,830
Fading in music: that the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the

1530
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:29,070
stream
And watery death-bed for him.

1531
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:32,860
He may win;
And what is music then?

1532
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:37,150
Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow

1533
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:42,810
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day

1534
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,950
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's
ear,

1535
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,360
And summon him to marriage.

1536
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,679
Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more

1537
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:53,989
love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem

1538
01:21:53,989 --> 01:22:00,410
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice

1539
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:06,159
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view

1540
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,650
The issue of the exploit.

1541
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:09,470
Go, Hercules!

1542
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:19,600
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the

1543
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,600
fray.

1544
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,929
Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets
to himself

1545
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:25,219
SONG.

1546
01:22:25,219 --> 01:22:31,360
Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?

1547
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,440
How begot, how nourished?

1548
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,480
Reply, reply.

1549
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:39,120
It is engender'd in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies

1550
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,550
In the cradle where it lies.

1551
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:46,980
Let us all ring fancy's knell
I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.

1552
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,980
ALL

1553
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,980
Ding, dong, bell.

1554
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:49,980
BASSANIO

1555
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:58,270
So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.

1556
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:06,050
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,

1557
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,560
Obscures the show of evil?

1558
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,130
In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow

1559
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:20,870
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

1560
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:28,790
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:

1561
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:33,239
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as
false

1562
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:40,520
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;

1563
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,580
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as
milk;

1564
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:52,170
And these assume but valour's excrement
To render them redoubted!

1565
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:58,930
Look on beauty,
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;

1566
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:06,520
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:

1567
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:14,159
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,

1568
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:20,540
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,

1569
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,770
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.

1570
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:31,630
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf

1571
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:40,969
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning times put

1572
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:44,270
on
To entrap the wisest.

1573
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:52,360
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;

1574
01:24:52,360 --> 01:25:01,470
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre

1575
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:05,120
lead,
Which rather threatenest than dost promise

1576
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:11,199
aught,
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;

1577
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:15,530
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

1578
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,530
PORTIA

1579
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:19,250
[Aside] How all the other passions fleet to
air,

1580
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:25,940
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!

1581
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:30,830
O love,
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,

1582
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:34,560
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.

1583
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,050
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
For fear I surfeit.

1584
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,050
BASSANIO

1585
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:41,050
What find I here?

1586
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,170
Opening the leaden casket

1587
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,679
Fair Portia's counterfeit!

1588
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:51,420
What demi-god
Hath come so near creation?

1589
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,660
Move these eyes?

1590
01:25:53,660 --> 01:26:00,550
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Seem they in motion?

1591
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:07,350
Here are sever'd lips,
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar

1592
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:10,570
Should sunder such sweet friends.

1593
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:17,469
Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven

1594
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:28,160
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--

1595
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:37,159
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both

1596
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:40,410
his
And leave itself unfurnish'd.

1597
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:47,119
Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this

1598
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:52,679
shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow

1599
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,310
Doth limp behind the substance.

1600
01:26:55,310 --> 01:27:01,969
Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.

1601
01:27:01,969 --> 01:27:02,989
Reads

1602
01:27:02,989 --> 01:27:11,410
You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!

1603
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:18,520
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,

1604
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,620
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,

1605
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:31,219
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.

1606
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,920
A gentle scroll.

1607
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:42,500
Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.

1608
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:48,270
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people's

1609
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:53,199
eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,

1610
01:27:53,199 --> 01:28:01,360
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;

1611
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:10,770
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,

1612
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:14,900
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.

1613
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,900
PORTIA

1614
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:22,050
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone

1615
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:27,750
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you

1616
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:33,560
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times

1617
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,100
more rich;
That only to stand high in your account,

1618
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:45,310
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me

1619
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:53,440
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;

1620
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:59,889
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,

1621
01:28:59,889 --> 01:29:05,989
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit

1622
01:29:05,989 --> 01:29:13,310
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.

1623
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:18,179
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord

1624
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:25,429
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,

1625
01:29:25,429 --> 01:29:32,890
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this

1626
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:36,219
ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,

1627
01:29:36,219 --> 01:29:41,420
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

1628
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:42,420
BASSANIO

1629
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:50,909
Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;

1630
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:56,869
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As after some oration fairly spoke

1631
01:29:56,869 --> 01:30:02,989
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;

1632
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:11,390
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,

1633
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:13,659
Express'd and not express'd.

1634
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:20,220
But when this ring
Parts from this finger, then parts life from

1635
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:26,070
hence:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

1636
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,070
NERISSA

1637
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:34,070
My lord and lady, it is now our time,
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,

1638
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:38,820
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

1639
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,820
GRATIANO

1640
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:44,810
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;

1641
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:49,429
For I am sure you can wish none from me:
And when your honours mean to solemnize

1642
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:54,989
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
Even at that time I may be married too.

1643
01:30:54,989 --> 01:30:55,989
BASSANIO

1644
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:59,210
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

1645
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,210
GRATIANO

1646
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:03,260
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.

1647
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:08,550
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;

1648
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:12,130
You loved, I loved for intermission.

1649
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:15,239
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.

1650
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:20,020
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;

1651
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:25,119
For wooing here until I sweat again,
And sweating until my very roof was dry

1652
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:31,060
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
I got a promise of this fair one here

1653
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:35,360
To have her love, provided that your fortune
Achieved her mistress.

1654

PORTIA

1655
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,369
Is this true, Nerissa?

NERISSA

1657
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:41,380
Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.

1658
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,380
BASSANIO

1659
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,400
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

1660
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,400
GRATIANO

1661
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,110
Yes, faith, my lord.

BASSANIO

1663
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,820
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

GRATIANO

1665
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,050
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand
ducats.

NERISSA

1667
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,230
What, and stake down?

GRATIANO

1669
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:01,889
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and
stake down.

1670
01:32:01,889 --> 01:32:03,739
But who comes here?

1671
01:32:03,739 --> 01:32:04,760
Lorenzo and his infidel?

1672
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,090
What,
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?

1673
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,970
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger
from Venice

1674
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:13,970
BASSANIO

1675
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:18,820
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
If that the youth of my new interest here

1676
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,900
Have power to bid you welcome.

1677
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,690
By your leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen,

1678
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:27,690
Sweet Portia, welcome.

1679
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,690
PORTIA

1680
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:31,719
So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.

1681
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:32,719
LORENZO

1682
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:33,790
I thank your honour.

1683
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:38,739
For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;

1684
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:43,960
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,

1685
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,320
To come with him along.

1686
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,320
SALERIO

1687
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,520
I did, my lord;
And I have reason for it.

1688
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,550
Signior Antonio
Commends him to you.

1689
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:52,550
Gives Bassanio a letter

1690
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:53,550
BASSANIO

1691
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:56,210
Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

1692
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:57,210
SALERIO

1693
01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:02,409
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there

1694
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:03,909
Will show you his estate.

1695
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:04,909
GRATIANO

1696
01:33:04,909 --> 01:33:09,940
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.

1697
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:12,620
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?

1698
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:16,350
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?

1699
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:21,540
I know he will be glad of our success;
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

1700
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,540
SALERIO

1701
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,870
I would you had won the fleece that he hath
lost.

1702
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:25,870
PORTIA

1703
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,840
There are some shrewd contents in yon same
paper,

1704
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:34,190
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the

1705
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:36,300
world
Could turn so much the constitution

1706
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,949
Of any constant man.

1707
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:40,989
What, worse and worse!

1708
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:45,350
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything

1709
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:47,440
That this same paper brings you.

1710
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,440
BASSANIO

1711
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:54,540
O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words

1712
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,540
That ever blotted paper!

1713
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:01,500
Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,

1714
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:09,020
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;

1715
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:15,830
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see

1716
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:19,000
How much I was a braggart.

1717
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,790
When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told

1718
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:26,469
you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,

1719
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:34,020
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,

1720
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,790
To feed my means.

1721
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:41,500
Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,

1722
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,239
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood.

1723
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:50,460
But is it true, Salerio?

1724
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,910
Have all his ventures fail'd?

1725
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:56,100
What, not one hit?

1726
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:02,400
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?

1727
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:08,360
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?

1728
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,360
SALERIO

1729
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,950
Not one, my lord.

1730
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:16,969
Besides, it should appear, that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew,

1731
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:18,480
He would not take it.

1732
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,429
Never did I know
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,

1733
01:35:22,429 --> 01:35:28,190
So keen and greedy to confound a man:
He plies the duke at morning and at night,

1734
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:34,389
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,

1735
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:39,970
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with

1736
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:42,949
him;
But none can drive him from the envious plea

1737
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:46,770
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.

1738
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:47,770
JESSICA

1739
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:52,870
When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,

1740
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:58,560
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum

1741
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,740
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
If law, authority and power deny not,

1742
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,300
It will go hard with poor Antonio.

1743
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,300
PORTIA

1744
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,600
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

1745
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,600
BASSANIO

1746
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:17,369
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit

1747
01:36:17,369 --> 01:36:23,830
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears

1748
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:26,320
Than any that draws breath in Italy.

1749
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,320
PORTIA

1750
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,830
What sum owes he the Jew?

1751
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:29,830
BASSANIO

1752
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:31,560
For me three thousand ducats.

1753
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,560
PORTIA

1754
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,560
What, no more?

1755
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:39,270
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Double six thousand, and then treble that,

1756
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:43,160
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

1757
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:48,400
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;

1758
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,889
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul.

1759
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:55,320
You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:

1760
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,230
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.

1761
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:02,179
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows.

1762
01:37:02,179 --> 01:37:03,230
Come, away!

1763
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:09,030
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:

1764
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:12,130
Since you are dear bought, I will love you
dear.

1765
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:14,030
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

1766
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:15,030
BASSANIO

1767
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:21,110
[Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate

1768
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:26,360
is
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and

1769
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:30,690
since
in paying it, it is impossible I should live,

1770
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:34,420
all
debts are cleared between you and I, if I

1771
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,740
might but
see you at my death.

1772
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:42,639
Notwithstanding, use your
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you

1773
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,949
to come,
let not my letter.

1774
01:37:44,949 --> 01:37:45,949
PORTIA

1775
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:48,730
O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

1776
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,730
BASSANIO

1777
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:55,260
Since I have your good leave to go away,
I will make haste: but, till I come again,

1778
01:37:55,260 --> 01:38:00,810
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

1779
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:01,810
Exeunt

1780
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:02,810
Scene 3

1781
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:03,810
Venice.

1782
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:04,810
A street.

1783
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:05,810
Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler

1784
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:06,810
SHYLOCK

1785
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:15,070
Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:

1786
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:17,050
Gaoler, look to him.

1787
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:18,050
ANTONIO

1788
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,110
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

1789
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:20,110
SHYLOCK

1790
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:26,880
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.

1791
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:32,659
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:

1792
01:38:32,659 --> 01:38:35,540
The duke shall grant me justice.

1793
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:39,159
I do wonder,
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond

1794
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:41,530
To come abroad with him at his request.

1795
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:42,530
ANTONIO

1796
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,969
I pray thee, hear me speak.

1797
01:38:43,969 --> 01:38:44,969
SHYLOCK

1798
01:38:44,969 --> 01:38:52,790
I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no

1799
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:53,790
more.

1800
01:38:53,790 --> 01:39:01,270
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield

1801
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,980
To Christian intercessors.

1802
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:10,890
Follow not;
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.

1803
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:11,890
Exit

1804
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:12,890
SALARINO

1805
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,540
It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men.

1806
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:16,540
ANTONIO

1807
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:20,159
Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.

1808
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:25,540
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures

1809
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:29,610
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.

1810
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:30,610
SALARINO

1811
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:33,550
I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

1812
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,550
ANTONIO

1813
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:38,300
The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have

1814
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:44,511
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Will much impeach the justice of his state;

1815
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:48,489
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations.

1816
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:53,510
Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,

1817
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:58,120
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.

1818
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,340
Well, gaoler, on.

1819
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:04,770
Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

1820
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,770
Exeunt

1821
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:06,770
Scene 4

1822
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,770
Belmont.

1823
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:08,770
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1824
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,900
Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and
BALTHASAR

1825
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,900
LORENZO

1826
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:19,949
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit

1827
01:40:19,949 --> 01:40:28,150
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.

1828
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:35,100
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
How true a gentleman you send relief,

1829
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:43,260
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work

1830
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,420
Than customary bounty can enforce you.

1831
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:47,420
PORTIA

1832
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:50,880
I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now: for in companions

1833
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:56,890
That do converse and waste the time together,
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,

1834
01:40:56,890 --> 01:41:00,560
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;

1835
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:06,260
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,

1836
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,920
Must needs be like my lord.

1837
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,230
If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd

1838
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:14,800
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!

1839
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:21,820
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.

1840
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,820
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house

1841
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:32,460
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow

1842
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:36,460
To live in prayer and contemplation,
Only attended by Nerissa here,

1843
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:41,530
Until her husband and my lord's return:
There is a monastery two miles off;

1844
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,630
And there will we abide.

1845
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:45,969
I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition;

1846
01:41:45,969 --> 01:41:50,369
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.

1847
01:41:50,369 --> 01:41:51,369

Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the
father

promise ye, I fear you.

I was always plain with
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the

matter:
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think

1908

you
are damned.

1909
01:44:30,429 --> 01:44:36,159
There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard

And what hope is that, I pray thee?

LAUNCELOT

Marry, you may partly hope that your father
got you

01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,040
not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.

JESSICA

1917
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,370
That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed:
so the

01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:50,940
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.

Truly then I fear you are damned both by father
and

1921
01:44:54,739 --> 01:44:57,690
mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father,
I

1922
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:01,190
fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you
are

Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
enow before; e'en as many as could well live,

1929

one by
another.

1930
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:19,660
This making Christians will raise the
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters,

01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:22,550
we
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals

He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter:

says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,

raise the

LAUNCELOT

1951
01:46:05,409 --> 01:46:07,480
It is much that the Moor should be more than
reason:

1952
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:10,290
but if she be less than an honest woman, she
is

01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:55,620
DUKE

2018
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:57,560
What, is Antonio here?

2019
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,560
ANTONIO

2020
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,699
Ready, so please your grace.

2021
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:01,699
DUKE

2022
01:50:01,699 --> 01:50:07,080
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch

2023
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:11,750
uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.

2024
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:12,750
ANTONIO

2025
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:17,040
I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify

2026
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:23,270
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me

2027
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:28,889
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd

2028
01:50:28,889 --> 01:50:34,050
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.

2029
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:35,050
DUKE

2030
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,420
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

2031
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,420
SALERIO

2032
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:41,180
He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.

2033
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,000
Enter SHYLOCK

2034
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
DUKE

2035
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,829
Make room, and let him stand before our face.

2036
01:50:46,829 --> 01:50:51,260
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so
too,

2037
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:53,760
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy
malice

2038
01:50:53,760 --> 01:51:00,329
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange

2039
01:51:00,329 --> 01:51:06,540
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,

2040
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:11,830
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,

2041
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:17,040
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;

2042
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:22,590
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,

2043
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:27,099
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state

2044
01:51:27,099 --> 01:51:33,869
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd

2045
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:36,810
To offices of tender courtesy.

2046
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:39,780
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

2047
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,780
SHYLOCK

2048
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:46,700
I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn

2049
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:52,730
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light

2050
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:55,180
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.

2051
01:51:55,180 --> 01:52:02,340
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive

2052
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:10,610
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?

2053
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:16,179
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats

2054
01:52:16,179 --> 01:52:17,920
To have it baned?

2055
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,869
What, are you answer'd yet?

2056
01:52:20,869 --> 01:52:27,090
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;

2057
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:30,480
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the
nose,

2058
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:36,270
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood

2059
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:38,830
Of what it likes or loathes.

2060
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:44,560
Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,

2061
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:51,679
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;

2062
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:57,820
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame

2063
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:04,619
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,

2064
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:09,469
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus

2065
01:53:09,469 --> 01:53:11,989
A losing suit against him.

2066
01:53:11,989 --> 01:53:13,829
Are you answer'd?

2067
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:14,869
BASSANIO

2068
01:53:14,869 --> 01:53:20,619
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

2069
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:21,619
SHYLOCK

2070
01:53:21,619 --> 01:53:24,929
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

2071
01:53:24,929 --> 01:53:25,929
BASSANIO

2072
01:53:25,929 --> 01:53:29,090
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

2073
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:30,119
SHYLOCK

2074
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:33,159
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

2075
01:53:33,159 --> 01:53:34,159
BASSANIO

2076
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:36,869
Every offence is not a hate at first.

2077
01:53:36,869 --> 01:53:37,869
SHYLOCK

2078
01:53:37,869 --> 01:53:40,430
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee
twice?

2079
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:41,430
ANTONIO

2080
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:46,150
I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach

2081
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:52,159
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf

2082
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:57,540
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines

2083
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:03,579
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;

2084
01:54:03,579 --> 01:54:08,100
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that--than which what's

2085
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,100
harder?--
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech

2086
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:16,099
you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,

2087
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:21,780
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

2088
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,780
BASSANIO

2089
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,780
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

2090
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:26,780
SHYLOCK

2091
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:34,500
What judgment shall I dread, doing
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,

2092
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,400
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

2093
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,400
DUKE

2094
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,520
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

2095
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,520
SHYLOCK

2096
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:45,770
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

2097
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:53,829
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

2098
01:54:53,829 --> 01:55:03,290
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,

2099
01:55:03,290 --> 01:55:08,909
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?

2100
01:55:08,909 --> 01:55:11,699
Why sweat they under burthens?

2101
01:55:11,699 --> 01:55:15,760
let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates

2102
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,580
Be season'd with such viands?

2103
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:25,159
You will answer
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:

2104
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:32,829
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have

2105
01:55:32,829 --> 01:55:33,989
it.

2106
01:55:33,989 --> 01:55:37,159
If you deny me, fie upon your law!

2107
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:39,810
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

2108
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:42,949
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have
it?

2109
01:55:42,949 --> 01:55:43,949
DUKE

2110
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:49,020
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,

2111
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:52,739
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.

2112
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:53,739
SALERIO

2113
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:57,850
My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,

2114
01:55:57,850 --> 01:55:59,389
New come from Padua.

2115
01:55:59,389 --> 01:56:00,389
DUKE

2116
01:56:00,389 --> 01:56:02,760
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

2117
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:03,760
BASSANIO

2118
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,369
Good cheer, Antonio!

2119
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:07,870
What, man, courage yet!

2120
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:12,000
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones
and all,

2121
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,239
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

2122
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:16,239
ANTONIO

2123
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:20,929
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit

2124
01:56:20,929 --> 01:56:26,410
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,

2125
01:56:26,410 --> 01:56:28,790
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.

2126
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:32,301
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk

2127
01:56:32,301 --> 01:56:33,301
DUKE

2128
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:36,150
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

2129
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,150
NERISSA

2130
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,270
From both, my lord.

2131
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:40,139
Bellario greets your grace.

2132
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:41,139
Presenting a letter

2133
01:56:41,139 --> 01:56:42,139
BASSANIO

2134
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:44,349
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

2135
01:56:44,349 --> 01:56:45,349
SHYLOCK

2136
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:48,430
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

2137
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,430
GRATIANO

2138
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:55,560
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,

2139
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,750
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy.

2140
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,579
Can no prayers pierce thee?

2141
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:03,579
SHYLOCK

2142
01:57:03,579 --> 01:57:05,969
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

2143
01:57:05,969 --> 01:57:06,969
GRATIANO

2144
01:57:06,969 --> 01:57:09,240
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!

2145
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,739
And for thy life let justice be accused.

2146
01:57:11,739 --> 01:57:16,540
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,

2147
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:21,909
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit

2148
01:57:21,909 --> 01:57:27,790
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,

2149
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:30,900
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd
dam,

2150
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:35,660
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.

2151
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,660
SHYLOCK

2152
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:39,949
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my
bond,

2153
01:57:39,949 --> 01:57:45,520
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall

2154
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,579
To cureless ruin.

2155
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:49,810
I stand here for law.

2156
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:50,810
DUKE

2157
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:55,989
This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.

2158
01:57:55,989 --> 01:57:56,989
Where is he?

2159
01:57:56,989 --> 01:57:57,989
NERISSA

2160
01:57:57,989 --> 01:58:01,570
He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit

2161
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:02,570
him.

2162
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:03,570
DUKE

2163
01:58:03,570 --> 01:58:04,570
With all my heart.

2164
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:09,619
Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.

2165
01:58:09,619 --> 01:58:12,290
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

2166
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:13,290
Clerk

2167
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:15,730
[Reads]
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt

2168
01:58:15,730 --> 01:58:19,270
of
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant

2169
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:22,500
that
your messenger came, in loving visitation

2170
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:26,920
was with
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar.

2171
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:30,040
I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy

2172
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:33,670
between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned

2173
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:36,770
o'er
many books together: he is furnished with

2174
01:58:36,770 --> 01:58:39,750
my
opinion; which, bettered with his own learning,

2175
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:43,340
the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend,

2176
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:46,369
comes
with him, at my importunity, to fill up your

2177
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:48,699
grace's
request in my stead.

2178
01:58:48,699 --> 01:58:54,420
I beseech you, let his lack of
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend

2179
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,900
estimation; for I never knew so young a body
with so

2180
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,940
old a head.

2181
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:03,310
I leave him to your gracious
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish

2182
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:06,400
his
commendation.

2183
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,949
DUKE

2184
01:59:08,949 --> 01:59:13,830
You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

2185
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:14,830
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws

2186
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:16,639
Give me your hand.

2187
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:18,239
Come you from old Bellario?

2188
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,239
PORTIA

2189
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:20,239
I did, my lord.

2190
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:21,239
DUKE

2191
01:59:21,239 --> 01:59:22,660
You are welcome: take your place.

2192
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:27,579
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?

2193
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:28,579
PORTIA

2194
01:59:28,579 --> 01:59:30,050
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.

2195
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:33,159
Which is the merchant here, and which the
Jew?

2196
01:59:33,159 --> 01:59:34,159
DUKE

2197
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:36,240
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

2198
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,240
PORTIA

2199
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,240
Is your name Shylock?

2200
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,520
SHYLOCK

2201
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,080
Shylock is my name.

2202
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,080
PORTIA

2203
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,079
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law

2204
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:50,300
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.

2205
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,970
You stand within his danger, do you not?

2206
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:53,970
ANTONIO

2207
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,290
Ay, so he says.

2208
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:56,290
PORTIA

2209
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:57,690
Do you confess the bond?

2210
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:58,690
ANTONIO

2211
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,690
I do.

2212
01:59:59,690 --> 02:00:00,690
PORTIA

2213
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:01,690
Then must the Jew be merciful.

2214
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:02,690
SHYLOCK

2215
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:06,130
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

2216
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:07,130
PORTIA

2217
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:12,120
The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

2218
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:19,590
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:

2219
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:24,520
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;

2220
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:29,860
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,

2221
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:35,360
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;

2222
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:40,950
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;

2223
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:45,099
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.

2224
02:00:45,099 --> 02:00:50,320
Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,

2225
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:57,050
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;

2226
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:59,000
And that same prayer doth teach us all to
render

2227
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,739
The deeds of mercy.

2228
02:01:00,739 --> 02:01:04,060
I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;

2229
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:07,300
Which if thou follow, this strict court of
Venice

2230
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:10,170
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant
there.

2231
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:11,170
SHYLOCK

2232
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,840
My deeds upon my head!

2233
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:17,390
I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

2234
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:18,390
PORTIA

2235
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:20,790
Is he not able to discharge the money?

2236
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:21,790
BASSANIO

2237
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:28,540
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,

2238
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:35,390
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:

2239
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:42,280
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth.

2240
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:46,110
And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:

2241
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:53,020
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.

2242
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:54,020
PORTIA

2243
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:58,120
It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:

2244
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:03,340
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example

2245
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:06,420
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

2246
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:07,420
SHYLOCK

2247
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,010
A Daniel come to judgment!

2248
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:10,329
yea, a Daniel!

2249
02:02:10,329 --> 02:02:13,230
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!

2250
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:14,230
PORTIA

2251
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:15,710
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

2252
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:16,710
SHYLOCK

2253
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:19,340
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

2254
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:20,340
PORTIA

2255
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,860
Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd
thee.

2256
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,860
SHYLOCK

2257
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:30,080
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

2258
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,080
No, not for Venice.

2259
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,080
PORTIA

2260
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,829
Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim

2261
02:02:36,829 --> 02:02:40,980
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart.

2262
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:45,429
Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

2263
02:02:45,429 --> 02:02:46,429
SHYLOCK

2264
02:02:46,429 --> 02:02:48,460
When it is paid according to the tenor.

2265
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:53,770
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition

2266
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:57,540
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the
law,

2267
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:02,900
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear

2268
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:08,469
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

2269
02:03:08,469 --> 02:03:09,469
ANTONIO

2270
02:03:09,469 --> 02:03:12,300
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.

2271
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,300
PORTIA

2272
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:17,409
Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

2273
02:03:17,409 --> 02:03:18,409
SHYLOCK

2274
02:03:18,409 --> 02:03:19,409
O noble judge!

2275
02:03:19,409 --> 02:03:21,349
O excellent young man!

2276
02:03:21,349 --> 02:03:22,349
PORTIA

2277
02:03:22,349 --> 02:03:26,190
For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,

2278
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:28,250
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

2279
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:29,250
SHYLOCK

2280
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:32,290
'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!

2281
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:35,180
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

2282
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:36,180
PORTIA

2283
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:37,370
Therefore lay bare your bosom.

2284
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:38,370
SHYLOCK

2285
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:43,450
Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?

2286
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:47,040
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

2287
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,040
PORTIA

2288
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,040
It is so.

2289
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,219
Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?

2290
02:03:51,219 --> 02:03:52,219
SHYLOCK

2291
02:03:52,219 --> 02:03:53,219
I have them ready.

2292
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:54,219
PORTIA

2293
02:03:54,219 --> 02:04:00,230
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.

2294
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:01,230
SHYLOCK

2295
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:02,920
Is it so nominated in the bond?

2296
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,920
PORTIA

2297
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:05,880
It is not so express'd: but what of that?

2298
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:08,639
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

2299
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:09,639
SHYLOCK

2300
02:04:09,639 --> 02:04:12,989
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

2301
02:04:12,989 --> 02:04:13,989
PORTIA

2302
02:04:13,989 --> 02:04:17,429
You, merchant, have you any thing to say?

2303
02:04:17,429 --> 02:04:18,429
ANTONIO

2304
02:04:18,429 --> 02:04:20,349
But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.

2305
02:04:20,349 --> 02:04:22,780
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!

2306
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:29,329
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind

2307
02:04:29,329 --> 02:04:35,680
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,

2308
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:41,540
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance

2309
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:44,989
Of such misery doth she cut me off.

2310
02:04:44,989 --> 02:04:49,460
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;

2311
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:56,699
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge

2312
02:04:56,699 --> 02:04:59,429
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.

2313
02:04:59,429 --> 02:05:05,349
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;

2314
02:05:05,349 --> 02:05:11,179
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

2315
02:05:11,179 --> 02:05:12,179
BASSANIO

2316
02:05:12,179 --> 02:05:18,409
Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;

2317
02:05:18,409 --> 02:05:26,290
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:

2318
02:05:26,290 --> 02:05:33,429
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.

2319

PORTIA

2320
02:05:34,429 --> 02:05:35,630
Your wife would give you little thanks for
that,

2321
02:05:35,630 --> 02:05:37,780
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.

2322
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:38,780
GRATIANO

2323
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:43,350
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could

2324
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:46,270
Entreat some power to change this currish
Jew.

2325
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,270
NERISSA

2326
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:52,090
'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

2327
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:53,090
SHYLOCK

2328
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:56,159
These be the Christian husbands.

2329
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:59,099
I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas

2330
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:01,929
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!

2331
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:02,929
Aside

2332
02:06:02,929 --> 02:06:06,720
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

2333
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,720
PORTIA

2334
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:14,710
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give

2335
02:06:14,710 --> 02:06:15,710
it.

2336
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:16,710
SHYLOCK

2337
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:17,810
Most rightful judge!

PORTIA

2339
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:24,130
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

02:06:24,130 --> 02:06:25,130
SHYLOCK

2341
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:26,130
Most learned judge!

2342
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:27,130
A sentence!

2343
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:28,340
Come, prepare!

PORTIA

2345
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:33,849
Tarry a little; there is something else.

2346
02:06:33,849 --> 02:06:39,410
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'

2347
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:43,610
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of
flesh;

2348
02:06:43,610 --> 02:06:49,611
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and

2349
02:06:49,611 --> 02:06:53,770
goods

2692
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:46,320
We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.

2693
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:47,780
Are they return'd?

2694
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:48,780
LORENZO

2695
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:53,380
Madam, they are not yet;
But there is come a messenger before,

2696
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:54,890
To signify their coming.

2697
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:55,890
PORTIA

2698
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:58,560
Go in, Nerissa;
Give order to my servants that they take

2699
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:04,460
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.

2700
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:06,010
A tucket sounds

2701
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:07,010
LORENZO

2702
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:13,140
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

2703
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:14,140
PORTIA

2704
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:18,260
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,

2705
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:22,229
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

2706
02:24:22,229 --> 02:24:26,040
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their
followers

2707
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,040
BASSANIO

2708
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:32,850
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

2709
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,850
PORTIA

2710
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:38,630
Let me give light, but let me not be light;
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,

2711
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:43,220
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all!

2712
02:24:43,220 --> 02:24:45,279
You are welcome home, my lord.

2713
02:24:45,279 --> 02:24:46,279
BASSANIO

2714
02:24:46,279 --> 02:24:48,550
I thank you, madam.

2715
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:50,069
Give welcome to my friend.

2716
02:24:50,069 --> 02:24:56,540
This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

2717
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:57,540
PORTIA

2718
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:59,830
You should in all sense be much bound to him.

2719
02:24:59,830 --> 02:25:03,210
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

2720
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:04,210
ANTONIO

2721
02:25:04,210 --> 02:25:05,359
No more than I am well acquitted of.

2722
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:06,359
PORTIA

2723
02:25:06,359 --> 02:25:10,850
Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words,

2724
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:13,460
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

2725
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:14,460
GRATIANO

2726
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:17,561
[To NERISSA] By yonder moon I swear you do
me wrong;

2727
02:25:17,561 --> 02:25:22,580
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,

2728
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:25,290
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

2729
02:25:25,290 --> 02:25:26,290
PORTIA

2730
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:27,290
A quarrel, ho, already!

2731
02:25:27,290 --> 02:25:28,310
what's the matter?

2732
02:25:28,310 --> 02:25:29,310
GRATIANO

2733
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:33,890
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was

2734
02:25:33,890 --> 02:25:39,090
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'

2735
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:40,090
NERISSA

2736
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:43,470
What talk you of the posy or the value?

2737
02:25:43,470 --> 02:25:49,670
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
That you would wear it till your hour of death

2738
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:56,110
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,

2739
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:59,700
You should have been respective and have kept
it.

2740
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:03,120
Gave it a judge's clerk!

2741
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,720
no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that

2742
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:09,720
had it.

2743
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:10,720
GRATIANO

2744
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,330
He will, an if he live to be a man.

2745
02:26:12,330 --> 02:26:13,330
NERISSA

2746
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:15,490
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

2747
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:16,490
GRATIANO

2748
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:21,090
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,

2749
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:26,840
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:

2750
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:29,180
I could not for my heart deny it him.

2751
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:30,180
PORTIA

2752
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:34,410
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first

2753
02:26:34,410 --> 02:26:37,760
gift:
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger

2754
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:40,340
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.

2755
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:46,710
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;

2756
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:49,270
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave
it

2757
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:54,580
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters.

2758
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:58,310
Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:

2759
02:26:58,310 --> 02:27:02,660
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

2760
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:03,660
BASSANIO

2761
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:07,450
[Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand
off

2762
02:27:07,450 --> 02:27:10,250
And swear I lost the ring defending it.

2763
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:11,250
GRATIANO

2764
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:14,680
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed

2765
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:19,780
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd

2766
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:22,439
mine;
And neither man nor master would take aught

2767
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:23,689
But the two rings.

2768
02:27:23,689 --> 02:27:24,689
PORTIA

2769
02:27:24,689 --> 02:27:26,560
What ring gave you my lord?

2770
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,750
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

2771
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:29,750
BASSANIO

2772
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:36,340
If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger

2773
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:40,130
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

2774
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:41,130
PORTIA

2775
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:44,120
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

2776
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:47,689
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.

2777
02:27:47,689 --> 02:27:48,689
NERISSA

2778
02:27:48,689 --> 02:27:51,620
Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.

2779
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:52,620
BASSANIO

2780
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:57,600
Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,

2781
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:04,649
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring

2782
02:28:04,649 --> 02:28:12,270
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,

2783
02:28:12,270 --> 02:28:15,290
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

2784
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:16,340
PORTIA

2785
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:20,979
If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,

2786
02:28:20,979 --> 02:28:26,431
Or your own honour to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.

2787
02:28:26,431 --> 02:28:31,481
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it

2788
02:28:31,481 --> 02:28:38,470
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?

2789
02:28:38,470 --> 02:28:44,189
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

2790
02:28:44,189 --> 02:28:45,189
BASSANIO

2791
02:28:45,189 --> 02:28:52,200
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,

2792
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,360
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of
me

2793
02:28:55,360 --> 02:29:00,060
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny
him

2794
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:06,490
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life

2795
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:09,230
Of my dear friend.

2796
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:11,260
What should I say, sweet lady?

2797
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:19,160
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;

2798
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:25,840
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it.

2799
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:31,450
Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night,

2800
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:34,840
Had you been there, I think you would have
begg'd

2801
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:37,930
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

2802
02:29:37,930 --> 02:29:38,930
PORTIA

2803
02:29:38,930 --> 02:29:44,380
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,

2804
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:49,720
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;

2805
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:56,170
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:

2806
02:29:56,170 --> 02:30:02,720
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:

2807
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:08,420
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,

2808
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:10,740
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

2809
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:11,740
NERISSA

2810
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:18,370
And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

2811
02:30:18,370 --> 02:30:19,370
GRATIANO

2812
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:25,990
Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

2813
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,990
ANTONIO

2814
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:29,351
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

2815
02:30:29,351 --> 02:30:30,351
PORTIA

2816
02:30:30,351 --> 02:30:33,240
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

2817
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:34,240
BASSANIO

2818
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:41,270
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,

2819
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:48,620
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--

2820
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:49,620
PORTIA

2821
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:50,840
Mark you but that!

2822
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:56,940
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,

2823
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:58,910
And there's an oath of credit.

2824
02:30:58,910 --> 02:30:59,910
BASSANIO

2825
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:05,939
Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear

2826
02:31:05,939 --> 02:31:09,510
I never more will break an oath with thee.

2827
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:10,510
ANTONIO

2828
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:15,270
I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's

2829
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:19,170
ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,

2830
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:23,790
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.

2831
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:24,790
PORTIA

2832
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:26,060
Then you shall be his surety.

2833
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:31,050
Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.

2834
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:32,050
ANTONIO

2835
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:34,040
Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

2836
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,040
BASSANIO

2837
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:38,350
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

2838
02:31:38,350 --> 02:31:39,350
PORTIA

2839
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:45,640
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

2840
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:46,640
NERISSA

2841
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:52,880
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,

2842
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:55,479
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

2843
02:31:55,479 --> 02:31:56,479
GRATIANO

2844
02:31:56,479 --> 02:32:01,000
Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:

2845
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,590
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved
it?

2846
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:05,590
PORTIA

2847
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:06,860
Speak not so grossly.

2848
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:12,729
You are all amazed:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;

2849
02:32:12,729 --> 02:32:18,930
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,

2850
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:24,580
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you

2851
02:32:24,580 --> 02:32:28,610
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Enter'd my house.

2852
02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:35,070
Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you

2853
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:37,960
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies

2854
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:43,520
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident

2855
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,180
I chanced on this letter.

2856
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,180
ANTONIO

2857
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:47,180
I am dumb.

2858
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:48,180
BASSANIO

2859
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:51,320
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

2860
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:52,320
GRATIANO

2861
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:54,810
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

2862
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:55,810
NERISSA

2863
02:32:55,810 --> 02:33:02,020
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.

2864
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:03,020
BASSANIO

2865
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:10,340
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

2866
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:11,340
ANTONIO

2867
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:17,850
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships

2868
02:33:17,850 --> 02:33:19,390
Are safely come to road.

2869
02:33:19,390 --> 02:33:20,390
PORTIA

2870
02:33:20,390 --> 02:33:21,390
How now, Lorenzo!

2871
02:33:21,390 --> 02:33:24,279
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

2872
02:33:24,279 --> 02:33:25,279
NERISSA

2873
02:33:25,279 --> 02:33:28,450
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.

2874
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:35,819
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,

2875
02:33:35,819 --> 02:33:39,840
After his death, of all he dies possess'd
of.

2876
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:40,840
LORENZO

2877
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:45,970
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.

2878
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:46,970
PORTIA

2879
02:33:46,970 --> 02:33:50,170
It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied

2880
02:33:50,170 --> 02:33:52,200
Of these events at full.

2881
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:56,260
Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,

2882
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:58,110
And we will answer all things faithfully.

2883
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:59,110
GRATIANO

2884
02:33:59,110 --> 02:34:03,840
Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,

2885
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:06,220
Whether till the next night she had rather
stay,

2886
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:12,150
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,

2887
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:15,570
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

2888
02:34:15,570 --> 02:34:27,720
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

2889
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:31,060
Exeunt
