00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,700
CHAPTER ONE
Ireland's story

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,059
There are many different Irelands.

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:19,370
One Ireland is a country with beautiful high
mountains, big empty beaches, long deep rivers.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,210
People go there to fish and swim and walk.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,740
They love Ireland because it is so quiet,
and because the Irish people are so nice and

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,470
friendly.

7
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,070
Another Ireland is a country of stories and
music.

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,550
Most Irish people can sing, and many famous
musicians are Irish.

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,430
A lot of the most famous writers in the English
language are Irish too.

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,180
But some people in Ireland speak only or mostly
Irish.

11
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,680
Now look again at Ireland.

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:08,600
It is not only a quiet, beautiful, friendly
place; it is also a country of blood, bombs,

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,270
and death.

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:18,649
Between 1968 and 1998 thousands of people
in Northern Ireland died.

15
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,640
But most Irish people are not interested in
bombs and guns.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,409
What is Ireland really like?

17
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,779
What can you see there?

18
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:35,210
And what happened hundreds of years ago, in
Irish history?

19
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:52,169
Turn the page to begin reading Ireland's story.

20
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:58,859
CHAPTER TWO
Around the island

21
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:06,599
Ireland is an island like a plate: it is higher
on the outside than in the centre.

22
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,920
Because of this, the centre of Ireland is
full of beautiful lakes and rivers, and many

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,420
people go there to fish and sail.

24
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,120
Ireland's largest lake is Lough Neagh.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,170
Its longest river, the Shannon, is 260 kilometres
long.

26
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:37,200
It goes through many small lakes and two large
ones, Lough Ree and Lough Derg.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,380
Most of Ireland's mountains are near the outside
of the plate, near the sea.

28
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:53,070
They are not very high - the highest is Carrantouhill
(1,040 metres) in the south-west.

29
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,570
But they are beautiful, and good places for
walks.

30
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:06,840
At the Cliffs of Moher, in the west, you can
look 200 metres straight down into the sea.

31
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,180
The Giant's Causeway, in the north, is made
of strange rocks two metres tall with six

32
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,680
sides.

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,820
There are hundreds of small islands in the
sea around Ireland.

34
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,780
On the Aran Islands, in the west, most people
speak Irish, not English.

35
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,450
Life has changed very little here in a hundred
years.

36
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,040
Much of the north and west of Ireland is very
beautiful.

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,760
There are hundreds of flowers in the green
fields, and there are wonderful beaches and

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,180
lakes (called 'loughs' in Ireland).

39
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,180
The weather is warm and wet, with rain and
sun nearly every day.

40
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,800
But it is hard to farm here because of the
rocks and mountains.

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,840
The centre and east of Ireland are very different.

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,930
The land is good here, and Irish milk and
meat are some of the best in the world.

43
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,439
Farming is one of the most important jobs
in Ireland.

44
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,789
Thousands of horses live here too.

45
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:31,590
Some of the best horses in the world come
from Ireland, and Irish people sell horses

46
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:38,039
to Britain, America, Australia, and Japan.

47
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:45,539
People go to watch horse races in many Irish
towns, and in Lay town, north of Dublin, there

48
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:51,099
are horse races along the beach every September.

49
00:04:51,099 --> 00:05:00,530
All Ireland's important cities - Dublin, Belfast,
Derry, Galway, Limerick, Cork, and Waterford

50
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,850
- are near the sea.

51
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:18,520
If we look at Ireland's history, we will see
why.

52
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,710
CHAPTER THREE
Celtic Ireland

53
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,719
The Irish are a Celtic people.

54
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:34,020
Thousands of years ago, the Celts came to
Ireland from western France and northern Spain.

55
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:44,620
They loved singing, and horses, and stories,
and they made beautiful gold and silver jewellery.

56
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,090
Many men wore gold rings round their necks
and arms.

57
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,909
A Greek writer, Diodorus Siculus, wrote this
about the Celts:

58
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,680
The Celts are... tall and strong.

59
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,029
They wear colourful shirts and trousers.

60
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:11,599
Before they fight they hit their long swords
on their shields, and shout with loud voices....

61
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,539
They are very good fighters.

62
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:24,370
When a Celt kills a man, he cuts off his head
and puts it above the door of his house.

63
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,539
Finn Mac Cool was a famous Celtic fighter.

64
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,020
There are many stories about Finn and his
men, the Fianna.

65
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,610
When he was a boy, he cooked a fish on a fire.

66
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,870
This fish knew everything about the world.

67
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,419
Finn touched the hot fish with his finger,
and put his finger in his mouth.

68
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,099
Then he knew everything about the world too.

69
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:59,900
'I know what is going to happen tomorrow,'
he said.

70
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,710
Another famous Celt was Cuchulainn.

71
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:12,349
Cuchulainn's father had a brother called Conor,
who was king of Ulster, in the north of Ireland.

72
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:17,719
Conor had a big, dangerous dog which killed
many men.

73
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:24,349
Cuchulainn liked to play a Celtic game called
hurling.

74
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:31,770
In hurling, the players can carry a small
hard ball in their hands and also hit it with

75
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,540
a stick.

76
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:40,520
One day, when Cuchulainn was a boy, Conor
called everyone into his house to eat.

77
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,500
But Cuchulainn and his friends wanted to finish
their game of hurling, so they stayed outside.

78
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:56,509
Conor's dog came out of the house, attacked
(he young boys and tried to kill them.

79
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:05,259
But Cuchulainn hit the hurling ball into the
dog's mouth, and then killed it with his stick.

80
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:13,520
A big fighting dog is called a hound, and
so after this, Cuchulainn was called 'The

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,479
Hound of Ulster.'

82
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,919
Celtic games, like hurling, are very popular
in Ireland today.

83
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,770
Irish people play the Celtic game called Gaelic
football.

84
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,060
In Gaelic football the players can use their
feet and hands.

85
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,850
Celtic stories and music are popular too.

86
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:47,930
There are many Celtic rock bands - one of
them is called Finn MacCool.

87
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:55,000
And some people in Ireland speak the Celtic
language called Irish.

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Irish is very different from English - for
example, the Irish for tree is craw, and the

89
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,320
word for woman is bean.

90
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:16,260
But Celtic people in Wales, Scotland, western
France, and northern Spain have languages

91
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,430
very like Irish.

92
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,330
A hundred years ago, Irish was nearly a dead
language.

93
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,200
Most Irish people spoke English, and only
the poor people in the west of Ireland spoke

94
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,390
Irish.

95
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,460
No one taught Irish in schools.

96
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:46,270
Most Irish people speak English today too,
but many children learn Irish at school, and

97
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,390
many older people in Dublin and Belfast learn
it too.

98
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,390
They can listen to the Irish language radio
station, Raidio na Gaeltachta, and watch Irish

99
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,500
language television on TG4.

100
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:18,180
The Irish language is popular again.

101
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,570
CHAPTER FOUR
St Patrick, the Church, and the Vikings

102
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,890
In 401 some Irishmen came to Britain.

103
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,370
They took many people back to Ireland and
sold them.

104
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,350
One of these people was Patrick, who was only
sixteen.

105
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,410
For six years young Patrick worked with sheep
on a farm.

106
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,440
Then, when he was twenty-two, he ran away
to France.

107
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,460
He learned about God from monks at a school
in a French monastery.

108
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:06,360
In 432 he went back to Ireland to teach the
Irish about God.

109
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,160
The Irish kings listened to him, and he built
an important church in Armagh.

110
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,090
A hundred years later, Ireland was one of
the most important Christian countries in

111
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:26,560
Europe, with beautiful churches and monasteries
everywhere.

112
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,340
Irish writers wrote famous, important books
like the Book of Kells, which you can see

113
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:41,450
in Dublin today, and there are pictures of
St Patrick in many Irish churches.

114
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:49,500
Another Irish churchman, called Brendan, sailed
to Scotland, Iceland, Greenland, and America

115
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,000
in a small leather boat.

116
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,570
Some people said that this was not possible,
but in 1976 an Englishman, Tim Severin, built

117
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:10,250
a leather boat called Brendan and sailed it
from Ireland to Iceland and America.

118
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:17,100
You can see the Brendan at Craggaunowen in
County Clare in the west of Ireland.

119
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,430
There were many beautiful, expensive things
in the Irish churches and monasteries, and

120
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:30,910
Norwegian Vikings came to Ireland to steal
them and kill the monks.

121
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:38,760
Because of this, the monks built tall round
towers beside their monasteries.

122
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,440
When the Vikings came the monks ran into the
towers to hide.

123
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,540
You can see these towers in Irish villages
today.

124
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,290
One of the most interesting Irish monasteries
is on Skellig Michael.

125
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,650
It is an island in the Atlantic sixteen kilometres
south-west of Ireland.

126
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,160
It is a beautiful, windy place.

127
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:13,240
The island is 240 metres high, and in bad
weather no boats can get there.

128
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:21,000
'There is no danger here,' the Irish monks
thought; but they were wrong.

129
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,100
In 824, Vikings came in their long ships to
attack Skellig Michael too.

130
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,500
But some Vikings came to Ireland to stay.

131
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:43,040
They built towns by the sea - Dublin, Cork,
Waterford, and Limerick.

132
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,380
The Celts liked to live in the country, but
the Vikings lived in towns.

133
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,290
Some of the Vikings married Celts, and learned
the Celtic language.

134
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,870
The Vikings came to the north of Ireland too.

135
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:07,560
One day two different Viking ships came to
a beautiful place in Ulster.

136
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:14,920
Both groups of Vikings wanted to stay there
and build a town, but there were too many

137
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,290
of them.

138
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,250
The two groups of Vikings looked at each other
angrily.

139
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,500
'We must fight,' said a Viking from the first
ship.

140
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,070
'The winners will live and keep the land,
and the losers will die.'

141
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,790
'No,' said a man from the second ship.

142
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,540
'I have a better idea.

143
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,630
Let's race to the beach in our ships.

144
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,010
The first man who holds the land in his hand
can keep it.

145
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,560
His people can stay, and the others must leave.'

146
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,650
So the two ships raced towards the beach.

147
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:06,280
One man stood at the front of each ship, ready
to jump down to the beach.

148
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,490
Then one ship went in front of the other.

149
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,000
The man in the first ship looked back at the
second ship, and laughed.

150
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,390
'We're going to win,' he said.

151
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,260
'This land will belong to us.'

152
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,600
'No, it won't,' said the man in the second
ship angrily.

153
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,790
'You will never win.

154
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,210
Never!'

155
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,850
Suddenly, he took out his sword, and cut off
his hand with it.

156
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,290
Then he threw the hand over the heads of the
men in the first ship.

157
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:50,020
The hand fell on the beach, and its bloody
fingers closed on the land.

158
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:56,000
'This is our land,' said the man with one
hand.

159
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,610
'It will never belong to you.

160
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,930
Never, never, never!'

161
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,940
That, is the story of the Red Hand of Ulster.

162
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,460
You can see the Red Hand on the flags of Northern
Ireland.

163
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:31,570
To learn why it is so important, we need to
learn a little more about Irish history.

164
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,450
CHAPTER FIVE
The English come to Ireland

165
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:44,610
A thousand years ago, Ireland had many kings
and they often fought each other.

166
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:53,840
In 1152 one Irish king, Dermot MacMurrough,
attacked another Irish king, Tiernan O'Rourke,

167
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,320
and took his wife.

168
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,100
Tiernan O'Rourke was the friend of a third
king, Rory O'Connor.

169
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:10,360
In 1166 Rory O'Connor was made king of all
Ireland.

170
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:19,209
At this time, Tiernan and Rory attacked Dermot
MacMurrough, but Dermot escaped to England.

171
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:25,800
Dermot then asked the king of England, Henry
the Second, to help him to fight Rory and

172
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,470
Tiernan.

173
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:36,930
So in 1169 Henry's men came to Ireland and
fought Rory and Tiernan, but they did not

174
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,230
go home again.

175
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,600
They took more and more of the land for themselves.

176
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,880
They built cities by the sea, and big castles.

177
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,140
Henry called himself King of England and Ireland.

178
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,760
But not all the Irish were happy about this.

179
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,880
For the next four hundred years, English kings
tried to rule Ireland from Dublin.

180
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,090
But it was very difficult.

181
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:15,480
The Irish did not listen to the King of England
- he was too far away.

182
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:23,080
In 1536 the English church changed from Catholic
to Protestant.

183
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,890
So England was a Protestant country, but Ireland
was still Catholic.

184
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,341
For the Protestant English, their king was
the most important man in the Church, but

185
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:43,860
for the Catholic Irish, the most important
man was the Pope - the leader of the Catholic

186
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,000
Church - in Rome.

187
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,730
There was a lot of fighting in Ireland about
this, and usually the English won.

188
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:00,090
The kings of England took more land from the
Catholic Irish, and gave it to Protestant

189
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,360
Englishmen and Scotsmen.

190
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:11,150
This plan was called the Plantation of Ulster,
because much of the land was in Ulster, in

191
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,680
the north of Ireland.

192
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:22,860
Englishmen from London built a new town in
a place called Derry, and called it Londonderry.

193
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,670
The Catholic Irish were angry about this and
wanted their land back.

194
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:35,340
In 1641 the Catholics attacked the Protestants
in Ulster.

195
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,100
They took their houses and clothes and killed
thousands of people.

196
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:50,380
Eight years later, in 1649, Oliver Cromwell
took an English army to Ireland.

197
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:57,800
Cromwell was the leader of the English after
the death of King Charles the First.

198
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:04,400
The English soldiers killed thousands of Catholics
in a town called Drogheda.

199
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:12,920
In 1685 the people of England and Scotland
got a new king - James the Second.

200
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,660
He was a Catholic, and he was not very popular.

201
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:26,260
Many people wanted a different king, and in
1688 William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant,

202
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,480
came to England.

203
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,860
He was married to James's daughter Mary, and
he wanted to be king of England, Scotland,

204
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,420
and Ireland.

205
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,740
In those three countries people who wanted
James to be king fought against people who

206
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,690
wanted William to be king.

207
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,250
Most of James's friends were Catholics in
Ireland.

208
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,910
With his help, they tried to get their land
back again.

209
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:03,560
They got most of it, but they could not get
Londonderry.

210
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,950
When they attacked it, the Protestants ran
inside the city walls and closed the gates.

211
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,490
For 105 days, the Catholic soldiers tried
to get inside and kill them.

212
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,720
The Protestants were cold and afraid and hungry.

213
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,780
They ate cats and dogs and horses, but they
did not open the gates.

214
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:41,360
15,000 people died during this time, which
was called the Siege of Derry.

215
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:51,100
At last, three Protestant ships came to Londonderry
with food and soldiers, and the siege was

216
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,530
over.

217
00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:00,380
After that the new Protestant English King,
William of Orange, won two very important

218
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:08,740
battles against the Catholics: the Battle
of the Boyne in 1690, and the Battle of Aughrim

219
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,980
in 1691.

220
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,190
The Catholic Irish didn't fight a big battle
again for 100 years.

221
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:26,630
So for the next hundred years life was very
difficult for the Catholic Irish.

222
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:35,290
Keeping their land or going to Catholic schools
or Catholic churches was very difficult and

223
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,080
they could not speak or vote in Parliament.

224
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,820
All the important people in Ireland were

225
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:52,780
Protestants, and all the big, beautiful houses
and the best farms belonged to Protestants.

226
00:22:52,780 --> 00:23:03,860
In most countries, people read about history
in books; in Ireland, history is alive today.

227
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,900
Every year, Protestants in Londonderry march
to remember 1688.

228
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:20,950
In Belfast, on 12 July, Protestant Orangemen
march with music and songs about King William

229
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:28,679
of Orange - often called 'King Billy'- and
the Battle of the Boyne.

230
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:43,920
Every year, Catholics are angry about these
marches.

231
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,350
CHAPTER SIX
The Great Hunger

232
00:23:49,350 --> 00:24:01,000
In 1795 and 1798 the Irish, with the help
of French ships and soldiers, fought the British.

233
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,110
But the British won, and many Irishmen - mostly
Catholics - were killed.

234
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:17,480
Three years later, in 1801, the Act of Union
made Ireland and Britain one country, with

235
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,250
one Parliament, in London.

236
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:30,270
For a hundred years after this, Catholic Irishmen
(called Nationalists) wanted to change the

237
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:38,660
Act of Union, and Protestants (called Unionists)
wanted to keep it.

238
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:46,560
At this time, in the west of Ireland, many
poor Catholics lived on very small farms.

239
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:54,610
They had very little money, and often they
had only potatoes to eat.

240
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:02,950
The poor, stony land was not good for many
things, but it was good for potatoes.

241
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:09,960
But in the 1840s something killed the potatoes.

242
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,250
One day they were fine, and then suddenly
they were black and dead.

243
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:23,970
The poor Irish farmers and their families
had nothing to eat.

244
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:31,610
Thousands of them died, and many more went
on ships to America, to find a new and better

245
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,799
life.

246
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:40,020
Some rich Protestants were happy when the
poor farmers started to leave.

247
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:47,140
They wanted to keep cows on their land, so
they asked the ships to take the poor people

248
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,010
away from Ireland to America.

249
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,800
But hundreds of people died on the ships too.

250
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:04,360
When the Irish people came to America, they
lived in big cities, like New York.

251
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:12,130
Every year on St Patrick's Day thousands of
Americans march through New York, and remember

252
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:19,120
how Irish people died, because there was no
food.

253
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,730
It is the biggest St Patrick's Day parade
in the world, because so many Irish people

254
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,910
live in America.

255
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:37,679
When these poor Irish people died, the Irish
language nearly died with them.

256
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,510
Most Catholic churchmen spoke English, and
the government told Irish teachers to use

257
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,600
English in school.

258
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,490
Only poor people spoke Irish.

259
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:56,690
'Irish is not important,' the teachers and
churchmen said.

260
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:03,970
They thought that speaking English was more
modern.

261
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,679
But some people thought that this was wrong.

262
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:15,090
In 1893 a group of Irish writers tried to
help the Irish language.

263
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,290
'Irish is the language of the Irish people,'
they said.

264
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:29,430
'Many countries have a language, games, music,
and stories that belong to them.

265
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,870
We must have those things too.'

266
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,940
A lot of people agreed with them.

267
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:44,880
These people called themselves Sinn Fein,
which is Irish for 'We Ourselves.'

268
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:54,390
At first, the people in Sinn Fein were only
interested in Irish language, music, and games.

269
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,130
But later, they began to think about other
things too.

270
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:03,740
'We don't want to belong to Britain,' they
said.

271
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:18,490
'We want Ireland to be a free country.'

272
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,480
CHAPTER SEVEN
Fighting to be free

273
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:30,040
By 1900, life was a little better for Catholics
in Ireland.

274
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:37,100
They could have land, they could vote and
speak in Parliament, they had Catholic schools

275
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,480
and churches.

276
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:47,210
But most Catholics were very poor, and every
year, thousands of them went to America or

277
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,410
Britain to look for work.

278
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:56,660
Catholic Irish Nationalists wanted to end
the Act of Union.

279
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:02,740
They wanted an Irish Parliament to decide
about things in Ireland.

280
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,000
But the Protestants did not want to give it
to them - and, not for the first time, they

281
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,960
were ready to fight for the things that they
wanted.

282
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,990
In 1914, the British government decided to
give Ireland an Irish Parliament.

283
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,140
'Ireland will still belong to Britain,' they
said.

284
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:36,960
'But the Irish Parliament will decide on Irish
things, like Irish schools, roads, and police.'

285
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:46,020
Most Irish Nationalists were happy about this,
but the Protestant Unionists were angry.

286
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,130
Most Protestants lived in Northern Ireland
near Belfast.

287
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,400
This part of Ireland is called Ulster.

288
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:03,640
Soon the Protestant Unionist army began marching
through the streets of Belfast with their

289
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,840
leader, Sir Edward Carson.

290
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,210
They wanted to keep the Act of Union.

291
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:18,559
'Ulster will fight,' they said, 'and Ulster
will be right!'

292
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,150
The British government did not know what to
do.

293
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:30,120
They wanted to give Ireland a Parliament,
but they did not want to fight the Unionists.

294
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,960
But then, in 1914, the First World War started.

295
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,770
Most of the Protestant Unionists, and many
thousands of Irish Catholics, went with the

296
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:47,410
British army to fight against Germany.

297
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,690
But many Irish Nationalists stayed in Ireland.

298
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,020
'We don't want to fight the Germans,' they
said.

299
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,090
'We want the British to leave Ireland.

300
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,299
Perhaps the Germans can help us.'

301
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:14,539
In 1916, a group of Irish Nationalists-mostly
Catholics - decided to fight for a free Ireland.

302
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:23,740
They were interested in Irish music, Irish
history, the Irish language, and Irish games.

303
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:30,890
But now they bought guns in Germany and tried
to bring them to Ireland in a German ship.

304
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:38,200
Their leader, Patrick Pearse, wanted much
more than an Irish Parliament.

305
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,669
He wanted Ireland to be free from Britain.

306
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:53,440
On Easter Monday 1916, Pearse and his men
went into the Post Office, in the middle of

307
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,059
Dublin.

308
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:57,980
Pearse walked to the door.

309
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,549
'Irishmen and Irishwomen,' he said.

310
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:06,070
'Ireland belongs to the Irish people!

311
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,309
Today Ireland is a free country!'

312
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,930
But the British did not agree.

313
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:22,160
For six long days there was a battle in Dublin,
and many men died.

314
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:30,030
After the battle, the government said that
Pearse and fourteen other important men had

315
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:35,330
to die, and they died in prison.

316
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,559
Nearly two thousand other Sinn Fein men went
to prison.

317
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:49,410
Easter Monday 1916 was a very important day
in Irish history.

318
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,940
After that day, everything was different.

319
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:03,130
In his poem Easter 1916 the Irish writer William
Butler Yeats wrote:

320
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,160
All changed, changed utterly.

321
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,250
A terrible beauty is born.

322
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:17,350
In 1919, Sinn Fein started to fight the British
again.

323
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:27,010
The Sinn Fein army was called the Irish Republican
Army, or IRA.

324
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:36,760
From 1919 to 1921 the IRA killed hundreds
of policemen and soldiers, and the police

325
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,880
and soldiers killed hundreds of IRA men too.

326
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,580
In Dublin, there were IRA men and women everywhere,
but it was very hard for the British soldiers

327
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,059
to find them.

328
00:33:53,059 --> 00:34:00,970
The IRA leader was Michael Collins, but the
British government didn't even have a photo

329
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,090
of him!

330
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:13,870
In 1921 the British government decided to
talk to Sinn Fein and the IRA, and in that

331
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:21,290
year, for the first time in history, most
of Ireland had an Irish government, with an

332
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,670
Irish President in Dublin.

333
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:30,660
But the Irish Republic is only three-quarters
of Ireland.

334
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,780
One quarter, in Northern Ireland, stayed British.

335
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:55,980
And here, fifty years later, the trouble between
Protestants and Catholics started again.

336
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,990
CHAPTER EIGHT
Northern Ireland

337
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:09,360
In 1921, about 60 percent of the people of
Northern Ireland were Protestant, and about

338
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,609
40 percent were Catholic.

339
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:20,900
Today the numbers are about 53 percent and
40 percent.

340
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:30,060
Most of the Protestants want to be British,
and most of the Catholics want to be Irish.

341
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,400
Hundreds of people have died because of this.

342
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:44,359
From 1921 to 1971 Northern Ireland had a Parliament
at Stormont.

343
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:54,180
There were always more Protestants than Catholics,
so the Protestants could do what they wanted.

344
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,540
Protestants had most of the best jobs and
the best houses.

345
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:08,700
Most of the police were Protestant too, and
they were afraid of the IRA.

346
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:15,320
At the same time, many Catholics were afraid
of the police.

347
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:24,369
Sometimes the IRA tried to kill the police,
and the police hit back at the Catholics.

348
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:27,900
It was a circle without an end.

349
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:36,060
In 1968 Catholics started to ask for a better
life.

350
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:44,710
They marched through the streets of Belfast
and Derry, asking for better jobs and houses.

351
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:52,900
But the Protestant police and Orangemen attacked
the Catholic marchers.

352
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:01,400
Many marchers were badly hurt, and all of
them were angry and afraid.

353
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:10,120
In 1969 British soldiers came to Northern
Ireland to try to stop the fighting, and at

354
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:16,090
first many Catholics were happy to see them.

355
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:24,500
But then the IRA started to kill soldiers
and policemen, and so the British soldiers

356
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:32,120
and police tried to find the IRA and put them
in prison.

357
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:39,869
Sometimes they put the wrong people in prison,
and so the Catholics didn't like the British

358
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:42,640
soldiers.

359
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,040
Over the next thirty years, many terrible
things happened.

360
00:37:49,040 --> 00:38:01,080
On 'Bloody Sunday' - 30 January 1972 - British
soldiers killed 14 Catholic marchers in Derry.

361
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,610
'The marchers had guns,' the soldiers said.

362
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,770
But nobody found any guns.

363
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:25,680
On 'Bloody Friday' - 21 July 1972 - the IRA
put 22 bombs in Belfast, all at the same time.

364
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:37,240
9 people died and 130 people were hurt, Protestant
and Catholic, British and Irish.

365
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,660
Some of them lost arms and legs.

366
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:49,080
The IRA put bombs in pubs and streets and
shops.

367
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:59,950
They killed soldiers and policemen, but they
also killed thousands of ordinary people.

368
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:08,200
Protestants in the Ulster Defence Association
- the UDA - killed thousands of ordinary Catholics

369
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,400
too.

370
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,160
These Protestant fighters are called Loyalists.

371
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:25,240
By 1979 there were hundreds of IRA and UDA
men in prison.

372
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:33,550
At first they were political prisoners, like
soldiers in prison during a war.

373
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:42,110
They could wear ordinary clothes, and they
did not do prison work.

374
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:50,760
Then Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime
Minister, decided that this must stop.

375
00:39:50,760 --> 00:40:01,080
'These men are criminals,' she said, 'so they
must be the same as other prisoners.'

376
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:08,859
Because of this some prisoners decided in
1980 to stop eating.

377
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:14,960
They drank water but they did not eat.

378
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,140
Day after day, they got thinner and thinner.

379
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:28,620
After 66 days, the first man, Bobby Sands,
died.

380
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:33,890
Then another man died, and another.

381
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:42,680
Ten men died in prison, because they wanted
to be political prisoners.

382
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,690
Most British people thought Mrs Thatcher was
right, but a lot of Irish Catholics didn't

383
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,030
agree.

384
00:40:53,030 --> 00:41:01,210
More and more of them started to vote for
Sinn Fein.

385
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:08,510
In many parts of Northern Ireland there are
Nationalist or Loyalist paintings on the walls

386
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,760
of houses.

387
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:18,810
The Loyalists usually show the Red Hand of
Ulster, or King William of Orange and the

388
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,520
Battle of the Boyne.

389
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,010
The Nationalists show Celtic pictures, and
pictures of Bobby Sands.

390
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:34,710
Both of them often show men with guns.

391
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:44,350
In 1998, the British and Irish governments
met with Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists.

392
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,930
They wanted to end the fighting in Northern
Ireland.

393
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:54,460
Together, they made the Good Friday Agreement.

394
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:02,660
This Agreement said that Catholics and Protestants
must work together in the government of Northern

395
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,660
Ireland.

396
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:14,650
Today, Catholics and Protestants still do
not agree about many things in Northern Ireland.

397
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:22,840
But after thirty years of fighting, people
are starting to talk to each other.

398
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:37,390
And most people are happy about that.

399
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,980
CHAPTER NINE
Dublin and Belfast

400
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,680
Dublin.

401
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,830
Dublin is the most important city in the Republic
of Ireland.

402
00:42:50,830 --> 00:43:00,540
Its population (the number of people who live
there) is 496,000.

403
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:05,810
The River Liffey goes through the centre of
Dublin.

404
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:14,150
Some people say that Ireland s famous black
beer, Guinness, is water from the River Liffey,

405
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,070
but it is not true.

406
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:25,060
But you can walk beside the river, and drink
Guinness in a pub when you are thirsty.

407
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,619
One of the most beautiful buildings beside
the river is the Custom House.

408
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:38,610
There is a nice walk along the river from
the Custom House to the O'Connell Bridge.

409
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:42,470
North of the bridge is O'Connell Street.

410
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:49,790
Here you can see the Post Office, famous for
Easter Monday 1916.

411
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:57,270
Not far from here is St Mary's, Dublin's biggest
Catholic church.

412
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:06,609
South of O'Connell Bridge is Trinity College,
Ireland's oldest and most famous university.

413
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:14,450
In here you can see Ireland's oldest books,
like the Book of Kells, which is a thousand

414
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,740
years old.

415
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,190
The beautiful Bank of Ireland is opposite
Trinity College.

416
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,500
Ireland's first Parliament was in this building.

417
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:34,589
Near Trinity College you can see the famous
statue of Molly Malone.

418
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:43,400
People say that she was a poor but beautiful
girl, who sold fish called cockles and mussels

419
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,740
on the streets to make money.

420
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,980
But sadly, she died when she was still young.

421
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,920
There is a famous Irish song about Molly:

422
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,030
In Dublin's fair city

423
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,849
Where the girls are so pretty

424
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:06,250
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone

425
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,000
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

426
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,180
Down streets broad and narrow

427
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:19,060
Singing 'Cockles, and mussels, alive alive-oh!'

428
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:25,030
Some of Ireland's best town houses are in
Merrion Square.

429
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:31,760
Many of Ireland's most famous writers, soldiers,
and leaders lived here.

430
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:39,109
They walked and talked in the small park in
the square, or in St Stephen's Green, not

431
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:42,220
far away.

432
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:50,040
Between Merrion Square and St Stephen's Green
is Leinster House, the home of Ireland's Parliament

433
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,690
today.

434
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:59,640
Dublin also has Phoenix Park, one of the largest
parks in Europe.

435
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:07,369
Ireland's President lives here, in a house
called, in Irish, Aras an Uachtarain.

436
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:12,890
Not far away from the Phoenix Park is the
old Kilmainham Prison.

437
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:22,440
Here visitors can see how some of Ireland's
most famous men and women lived in prison.

438
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,950
Dublin is a city of theatres, music, and fine
shops too.

439
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:34,109
And there are dozens of pubs, big and small.

440
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:41,910
Many people like to go to the pub to drink
beer, talk, and tell stories.

441
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:49,980
For example, there is a story about a visitor
and an Irish farmer in the country.

442
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,060
'Excuse me, can you tell me the way to Dublin,
please?'

443
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,570
the visitor asks.

444
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,410
The farmer thinks for a long time.

445
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,810
Then he says: 'No, I'm sorry.

446
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:10,099
If you want to go to Dublin, this is the wrong
place to start.'

447
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,760
Belfast.

448
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:25,570
Belfast (population 276,000) is the biggest
city in Northern Ireland, famous for the ships,

449
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:31,860
aeroplanes, and clothes that were made here.

450
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:38,240
The Titanic was built here in the Harland
and Wolff shipyard.

451
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:47,650
In 1912 the Titanic was the biggest, fastest,
most expensive ship in the world.

452
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:53,220
'This ship can never sink,' people said.

453
00:47:53,220 --> 00:48:04,470
But when the Titanic went to sea for the first
time, it sank, and about 1,500 people died.

454
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:13,240
Many of them were poor Irish people who wanted
to start a new life in America.

455
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:22,800
Now this part of the city is called the Titanic
Quarter, and it has new shops, offices, bars,

456
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,930
cafes, and hotels.

457
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:34,079
But you can still see the big Harland and
Wolff cranes, called Samson and Goliath, from

458
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,820
all over Belfast.

459
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:47,880
At Victoria Square, in the centre of Belfast,
there are new shops, restaurants, and cinemas.

460
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:56,220
And there are fine old buildings to see - City
Hall, the Custom House with its wonderful

461
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:05,320
statues, the Ulster Bank, and McHugh's Bar
- the oldest building in Belfast.

462
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:23,930
Once it was a house by the Belfast River,
and today it is a modern bar.

463
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,160
CHAPTER TEN
Four Irish cities

464
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,339
Cork.

465
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:36,500
Cork is the second largest city in the Republic
of Ireland.

466
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:45,000
In 820 the Vikings attacked a Christian monastery
here, and then stayed to build a town by the

467
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,440
River Lee.

468
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:55,260
Cork is in the south-west of Ireland and it
has a wonderful harbour for ships.

469
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:03,900
Many poor Irish people sailed from Cork to
America at the time of the Great Hunger, and

470
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:11,349
today ships and planes go from Cork all over
the world.

471
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:20,890
123,000 people live here today, and the city
of Cork is famous for music, dancing, theatre,

472
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,700
and film.

473
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:31,900
Many visitors come here too, on their way
to the beautiful south-west of Ireland.

474
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,740
In 2005 Cork was the European Capital of Culture.

475
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,950
Londonderry, or Derry.

476
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:52,830
Derry, with a population of 105,000, is the
second city of Northern Ireland.

477
00:50:52,830 --> 00:51:00,420
Protestants call it Londonderry, because in
1600 English Protestants from London built

478
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:06,910
a city here, but Catholics call the city Derry.

479
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:14,060
There was a small monastery here, beside the
River Foyle, in the time of the Vikings, but

480
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:20,369
the great walls of Londonderry were built
in the 1600s.

481
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:27,830
You can walk around these walls today: they
are one and a half kilometres long and nearly

482
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,960
six metres wide.

483
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,120
The old guns from the Siege of Derry are still
there on the walls.

484
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,220
But many people want to forget the battles
of the past.

485
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:51,079
In the last week of October, thousands of
people come to Derry for the Halloween festival.

486
00:51:51,079 --> 00:52:00,050
There is music, theatre, and a big parade,
in the biggest street party in Ireland.

487
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,290
Galway.

488
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:14,630
Galway (population 65,800) is in the west
of Ireland, at the mouth of the River Corrib.

489
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:22,260
In this part of the country the Irish language
is very strong, and you will see it and hear

490
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,170
it everywhere.

491
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:32,420
It is a centre for Irish music, singing and
dance, and there is an Irish language theatre

492
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,530
in Galway too.

493
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:43,070
From Galway you can visit Connemara, with
its beautiful wild lakes and mountains.

494
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,810
The Aran Islands are close by too.

495
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:55,170
People speak Irish here, and many visitors
like to come to these wild, lonely islands

496
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:02,870
to hear Irish music in the pubs and see the
difficult life of the islanders.

497
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,940
Waterford.

498
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:12,400
Waterford (population 45,000) is in the south-east
of Ireland.

499
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:23,329
It was Ireland's first city; the Vikings came
here in the 850s, and they came back in 914

500
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:26,010
to make the city.

501
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:35,240
It is famous for its glass (people have made
glass here since 1783) and for the ships that

502
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,560
were built here.

503
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:45,240
Three rivers meet the sea at Waterford - the
Rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir - and there are

504
00:53:45,240 --> 00:54:00,690
fine mountains and beaches to visit in this
part of Ireland.

505
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:07,440
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Stories, music, and dancing

506
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,089
Irish people love stories, and many great
writers were born in Ireland.

507
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:22,430
Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was a churchman
in Dublin.

508
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:30,940
In his book Gulliver's Travels a man called
Gulliver visits many strange countries.

509
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:39,310
In Lilliput all the people are about ten centimetres
high and in the country of the Houyhnhnms

510
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,960
horses are cleverer than people.

511
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,930
But when Gulliver comes home, nobody believes
his stories.

512
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:58,650
James Joyce (1882-1941) wrote all his stories
about Dublin.

513
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:04,810
His most famous book, Ulysses, is 700 pages
long.

514
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:14,380
It is the story of everything that one man,
Leopold Bloom, does in Dublin in one day - 16

515
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,460
June 1904.

516
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:26,050
And every year on 16 June - 'Bloomsday' - people
visit Dublin to talk about Ulysses and to

517
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:29,000
visit the places in the story.

518
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:40,280
Joyce's friend, Samuel Beckett (1906-89) won
the Nobel Prize for his work in the theatre.

519
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:47,619
His most famous work, Waiting for Godot, is
about two poor Irish men who are waiting for

520
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,680
a man called Godot.

521
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:58,119
Perhaps Godot is a man, perhaps he is God
- they don't know.

522
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,210
But he never comes.

523
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:08,740
Joyce and Beckett were born in Ireland, but
they went to work and live in France.

524
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:16,190
They had new and exciting ideas, and some
people in Ireland did not like them.

525
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:26,280
To the Irish government and the Catholic Church,
books like Ulysses were wrong, and after 1929

526
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,800
Irish people could not buy books like these
in the shops.

527
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:41,849
Life was difficult in other ways too - many
people had large families and little money.

528
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:48,070
Ireland was a poor country, and it was difficult
to find work.

529
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:56,520
Every year, many young people left Ireland
to look for work in other countries.

530
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,339
Because of these things some singers too were
very angry about life in Ireland.

531
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:09,849
Bob Geldof was born in Ireland in 1951.

532
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:17,540
His mother died when he was seven, and his
father was often away from home, so young

533
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,490
Bob was often alone.

534
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:30,570
He saw many poor people in Dublin, and his
band, the Boomtown Rats, sang loud, angry

535
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,220
songs.

536
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:41,280
In their song Banana Republic, they said Ireland
was a poor country with a bad government,

537
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,680
and too many police and churchmen:

538
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:56,250
Everywhere I go now and everywhere I see the
black and blue uniforms Police and priests

539
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:04,980
Bob Geldof wanted to change the world, and
in 1985 he planned some concerts called Band

540
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,839
Aid and Live Aid.

541
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:13,420
He used the money from the concerts to help
hungry people in Africa.

542
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:22,130
In 2005 he did this again, with a concert
called Live 8.

543
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:29,849
With another Irish musician called Bono, Bob
Geldof asked the presidents of many countries

544
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:34,200
to give help to Africa.

545
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,510
Bono is from an Irish group called U2.

546
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:45,990
Some people say that U2 are the biggest rock
band in the world.

547
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:53,310
Like Bob Geldof, the band do a lot of work
to help the poor people of the world.

548
00:58:53,310 --> 00:59:00,680
Two other famous Irish pop groups are the
boy bands Boyzone and Westlife.

549
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:09,390
There are famous women singers too, like Sinead
O'Connor, Enya, and Aoife Ni Fhearraigh.

550
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:13,680
There are many famous singers and writers
from Northern Ireland too.

551
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,849
Seamus Heaney was born in 1939 on a farm near
Derry.

552
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:30,080
In 1995 he won the Nobel Prize for his poems,
and people read them all over the world.

553
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:37,619
The famous singer Van Morrison grew up in
Belfast in the 1950s.

554
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,300
Most people in Ireland love music.

555
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:48,680
People sing in pubs in every Irish town, and
Irish songs are very popular on television

556
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,640
in other countries.

557
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:59,240
Ireland has won the Eurovision Song Contest
for the best pop song in Europe seven times;

558
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,200
this is more than any other country.

559
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:12,270
The Irish word for party is ceili - a time
for people to play music, tell stories, and

560
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:13,990
dance.

561
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:20,640
For hundreds of years, the Irish people have
loved dancing at ceilis.

562
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:26,730
In the 1700s, dancing teachers went from town
to town.

563
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:33,800
People lived in small houses, so they often
danced on the country roads.

564
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:42,460
They wore their best clothes to dance, and
played music all day and all night.

565
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:49,300
In many Irish dances, the dancers keep their
hands still by their sides, and move their

566
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,680
feet and legs very quickly.

567
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:02,040
Today thousands of Irish children learn Irish
dancing, and the best dancers from all over

568
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,730
the world come to dance in Ireland too.

569
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:15,110
The Irish dancers Michael Flatley and Jean
Butler are famous in many countries - thousands

570
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:31,140
of people have seen them in Riverdance and
Lord of the Dance.

571
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,970
CHAPTER TWELVE
A country for young people

572
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:41,670
Today, many things are changing in Ireland.

573
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:50,470
It is a country of young people: nearly 50
percent of its people are under twenty-five.

574
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:57,869
Fifty years ago, the Catholic church was full
of old men, and they decided what people could

575
01:01:57,869 --> 01:01:59,770
do.

576
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:03,809
Life was difficult for women and young people.

577
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:12,990
Today, the church is important, but the ideas
of women and young people are important too.

578
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:20,400
Two of Ireland's presidents were women - Mary
Robinson and Mary McAleese.

579
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:29,390
For Ireland's young people the future is about
pop music and computers as well as farming

580
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:32,450
and horses.

581
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:41,339
Ireland is a part of the European Union, and
most Irish people are very happy about this.

582
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:48,220
Ireland is not a poor country anymore; a lot
of business people come to Ireland and build

583
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,080
factories.

584
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:58,300
Now, perhaps 10 percent of Ireland's population
are people who have come from other countries

585
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,390
to find work there.

586
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:08,440
Many come from Poland and other countries
in Eastern Europe, and others come from China

587
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,000
and countries in Africa.

588
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:18,540
Today, young Irish people do not have to leave
their country to find work; they can find

589
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,430
work at home.

590
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:27,200
Ireland is an interesting, exciting place
for young people.

591
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,490
But of course, there are always problems.

592
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,900
There is more crime in Ireland than before.

593
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:39,640
And in Northern Ireland, the problems are
not over.

594
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:46,240
Every year the Protestant Unionists march
through the streets with their music.

595
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:52,980
We will always be British,' they say, and
they sing about William of Orange.

596
01:03:52,980 --> 01:04:01,460
'The British must leave Ireland,' say the
Catholic Nationalists in Sinn Fein.

597
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:07,190
The Unionists and the Nationalists cannot
both have what they want.

598
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:11,820
Here, history helps no one.

599
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:21,099
But most Irish people, in the north and south
of Ireland, do not want bombs, guns, and fighting.

600
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:24,079
They want to enjoy life.

601
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:31,670
They want people to visit their island, to
walk in their beautiful mountains, fish in

602
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:40,660
their quiet rivers, drink and sing and laugh
in their pubs, dance at their ceilis, and

603
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:45,560
most important of all, to talk.

604
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:51,750
Most of the time, the Irish are the friendliest
people in Europe.

605
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:55,960
And the three most important words in the
Irish language are:

606
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,460
Cead mile failte

607
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,400
'A hundred thousand welcomes'

608
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:13,100
- THE END -
