CHAPTER ONE
A Beautiful Wife

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,900
I cannot remember how, when or where I met
Ligeia.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,949
It was a long time ago and my memory is not
good.

4
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:30,499
But I think I met her first in a large, old
city near the Rhine in Germany.

5
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:33,250
She told me that she came from an ancient
family.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,510
But I never knew the family name of the woman
who was my friend, my partner in my studies

7
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,810
and finally my wife.

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,480
Why did I never discover her family name?

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,410
Perhaps because she did not want me to find
out, but I cannot remember.

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,530
I remember one thing very well: Ligeia was
tall and slim.

11
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,190
Later, at the end, she became very thin.

12
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,880
How can I describe her quiet, aristocratic
movements, or the strange softness of her

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,320
footsteps?

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,000
If she came into my office, I only knew she
was there when I heard her voice, or when

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,759
she put her white hand on my shoulder.

16
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,909
She had a beautiful face, but it was not a
classical kind of beauty.

17
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,770
There was something strange about it.

18
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:43,020
I have often tried to understand it: was it
her pure white skin or her thick, black hair?

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,780
I looked at her long, delicate nose many times.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,229
It was perfect!

21
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,799
I looked at her sweet mouth.

22
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,789
How soft and red it was!

23
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:58,770
And when she smiled, her teeth were white.

24
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,569
Then I looked into her eyes.

25
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,259
They were much bigger than normal eyes.

26
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:11,319
Sometimes, when she was excited, they looked
like a deer's eyes.

27
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,700
They were black, with long black eyelashes
and black eyebrows.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:23,450
But as I looked into them, I realised that
they had a strange expression.

29
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,830
I thought about it for many hours, sometimes
all night.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,660
What was the expression in those eyes?

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,680
I wanted to know.

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,380
Many times I thought I almost had the answer,
but then it was gone.

33
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,110
Ligeia was very determined.

34
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,070
She was always calm and quiet, but her determination
showed in her eyes.

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,790
It shone like a terrible energy, and sometimes
it frightened me.

36
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,870
Ligeia was very clever.

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,010
She was excellent at Latin and Greek, and
she knew many other languages perfectly; she

38
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,210
never made a mistake.

39
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,320
She was also a student of science and mathematics.

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,430
When we were first married I often asked her
for help with my studies, and we worked together.

41
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,540
But after she died I was alone.

42
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,140
Without her I was like a child in the dark.

43
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,450
When she first became ill, she did not come
to help me as often as before.

44
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,870
She lost weight and her skin became pale and
transparent.

45
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,370
When I saw that she was dying, I felt desperate.

46
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,110
Ligeia resisted death with all her energy
- she was determined to live.

47
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,370
I watched in agony as she fought for life.

48
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:59,180
I knew she loved me, but I only understood
how much she loved me now that she was dying.

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,900
She held my hands and said that she was devoted
to me.

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,710
I cannot talk about it now, but let me say
that her love for me was part of her determination

51
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,270
to live.

52
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:19,560
On the night she died she suddenly got out
of bed and cried, 'Oh God, must I die?

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,530
Must I lose my fight with death?

54
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,660
No, I can't die like this!'

55
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,190
But my dear Ligeia died.

56
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,790
I was so sad I could not stay in the old city
by the Rhine.

57
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,000
For a few months I travelled around, then
I bought an old abbey in an isolated part

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,170
of England.

59
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,920
This dark, sad place expressed my feelings
of loneliness.

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,770
But I decorated it with beautifully coloured
curtains, carpets and ornaments.

61
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,620
I said to myself, 'Perhaps the bright colours
will make me feel happier.'

62
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,710
Unfortunately they did not.

63
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,940
I began to drink too much.

64
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,650
But I do not want to speak about that time
of my life.

65
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,020
I will only say that one day I married Lady
Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine.

66
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,370
My new wife had blonde hair and blue eyes.

67
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:27,530
She was very different from my first wife,
but how could I ever forget Ligeia?

68
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,850
CHAPTER TWO
A Fight with Death

69
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,430
I took Lady Rowena back to a room high up
in the tower of the abbey, where we lived

70
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,690
for the first month of our marriage.

71
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,691
The room was very large, with an enormous
window made of glass from Venice.

72
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:56,200
The ceiling was high, like a church, and in
the center there was a big gold chandelier.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,800
There were sofas from the East, and an Indian
bed.

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,560
On the walls were long tapestries, like carpets,
with designs made of gold.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,710
The tapestries moved every time the wind blew.

76
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,750
My wife was afraid of me because I was often
sad and depressed.

77
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,520
She did not love me much and stayed away from
me, but I preferred this.

78
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,400
I always thought about Ligeia - my beautiful,
Ligeia, dead in the tomb.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,350
Sometimes in my dreams I called to her in
the night.

80
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,810
I imagined that perhaps my love for her could
bring her back to me.

81
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,410
At the beginning of the second month Lady
Rowena became ill.

82
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:52,260
She did not sleep very well, and told me she
could hear sounds and movements in the tower.

83
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,550
'You have a fever,' I said.

84
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,180
'You're imagining things.'

85
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,310
She got better, but then she went back to
bed with a second illness, worse than the

86
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,000
first.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,389
The doctors could not understand it.

88
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,479
Again Rowena began to hear little sounds and
movements in the bedroom, and they frightened

89
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,930
her.

90
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,729
One night at the end of September she woke
up suddenly.

91
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,900
I was sitting on a sofa by her bed.

92
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,770
She whispered to me that she could hear sounds
and see movements, and there was a frightened

93
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,360
expression on her thin face.

94
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,150
But I saw and heard nothing.

95
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,770
'It's the wind,' I explained.

96
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,830
'You can see the tapestries moving in the
wind.'

97
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,120
But her face was white with fear, and she
nearly fainted.

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,140
I remembered that there was some wine on the
table on the other side of the room.

99
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,620
As I walked under the light of the chandelier,
a strange thing happened.

100
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,820
I felt something invisible pass me, and on
the carpet I saw a shadow, almost the shadow

101
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,669
of a shadow.

102
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:06,900
I decided to say nothing to Rowena.

103
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,090
I poured out a glass of wine and gave it to
her.

104
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,919
Then I sat on the sofa and watched her.

105
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,270
After some moments I heard very quiet footsteps
on the carpet, coming towards the bed.

106
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:28,040
A second later, as Rowena was about to drink
the wine, I saw - or perhaps I dreamed that

107
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,669
I saw - three or four large drops of a bright
red liquid fall into the glass.

108
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,922
Rowena did not see it; she drank the wine,
and I said nothing because I thought it was

109
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:44,899
only my imagination.

110
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,600
After this, Rowena's health got much worse,
and on the third night she died.

111
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,020
Her servants prepared her for the tomb, then
covered her with a sheet.

112
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,450
The next night I sat alone with her body in
the bedroom.

113
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,110
Strange forms and shadows moved around me.

114
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:14,430
I looked nervously into the dark corners,
at the moving tapestries, and I felt frightened.

115
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,670
Then I looked at the carpet under the chandelier.

116
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,990
There was no shadow there, and I felt better.

117
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,850
When I looked at Rowena on the bed, sad memories
of Ligeia - the only woman I ever loved - came

118
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,800
back to me.

119
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,200
It was perhaps around midnight when I heard
a sound.

120
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,450
It was quiet but clear, and it woke me from
my dreams.

121
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,380
I thought it came from the bed.

122
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,510
I listened in terror, but I did not hear it
again.

123
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,680
I looked carefully at Rowena for any sign
of life.

124
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,480
She was not moving, but I continued to look
at her.

125
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,360
Minutes passed.

126
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,750
Then I noticed a little colour in Rowena's
face.

127
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,870
My heart stopped in horror; I could not move.

128
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,270
When I understood that Rowena was not dead,
I tried to revive her.

129
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,770
But soon the colour disappeared from her cheeks,
her face looked like marble again and her

130
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,260
lips were thin with the horrible expression
of death.

131
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:31,460
When her body was cold and rigid, I fell on
to the sofa and dreamed about Ligeia.

132
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,290
An hour later I heard the same sound as before.

133
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,110
I listened; yes, there it was again - a sigh
from the bed!

134
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,820
I ran over and saw clearly that her lips were
trembling.

135
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,510
Then they opened, showing her bright teeth.

136
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,839
I thought I was going mad.

137
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,010
There was a pink colour on her cheeks and
neck, her body was getting warm again and

138
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,180
her heart was beating a little.

139
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,370
Lady Rowena was alive!

140
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,470
I did everything I could to revive her.

141
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:12,640
Then suddenly her colour disappeared, her
heart stopped and her body became cold and

142
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,540
rigid.

143
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,530
I sat down and began to think about Ligeia
again.

144
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,120
Then again for the third time there was a
sound from the bed.

145
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,500
But why must I describe the horrors of that
night?

146
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,029
Again I tried to revive Rowena, and then a
fourth time.

147
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:38,709
Each time she seemed to fight with an invisible
force; and each time her body changed.

148
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,800
I cannot say how, but she looked different.

149
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,660
It was nearly dawn I when she moved again.

150
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,060
I was sitting on the sofa, exhausted, but
Rowena's body moved with more energy than

151
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,150
before.

152
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,470
Her colour returned, signs of life changed
her face.

153
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,760
Her eyes were closed, but she looked alive.

154
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,810
Then she suddenly got out of bed and walked
slowly to the centre of the room, like she

155
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,610
was walking in her sleep.

156
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,980
I did not tremble; I did not move.

157
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,160
I was as cold and still as stone, paralysed
by what I saw.

158
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,820
As I looked at her, my head filled with wild
thoughts.

159
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,930
Was Rowena really alive?

160
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,490
Could I really see her blonde hair and blue
eyes?

161
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,540
Why wasn't I certain?

162
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,540
I could not see her mouth very well, but her
cheeks were like pink roses.

163
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,140
Weren't they Rowena's cheeks?

164
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,440
But wasn't she taller than before?

165
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,810
I was filled with a kind of madness.

166
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,580
I ran to her, but she moved away.

167
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,390
Then I saw her long hair moving in the wind
- it was blacker than the black of midnight!

168
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,089
And now slowly her eyes opened.

169
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,360
I shouted like a madman, 'These are the black
eyes of my lost love - the eyes of Ligeia!'

170
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,760
- THE END -
