00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:04,730
The Boy Who Couldn't Sleep

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,680
On the day that he was born Max slept for
most of the time.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,700
And in the first weeks of his life he slept
like other babies.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,690
But when he began to look around him, he didn't
sleep so much.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,349
He slept for a few hours at night and a little
in the daytime.

6
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,060
Then he stopped sleeping during the day.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,740
He was awake for twenty hours.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,489
His eyes were always open!

9
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,399
His mother, Samantha Price, was very surprised.

10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,840
She said that the world was a very interesting
place and perhaps Max wanted to see everything.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,050
She thought this was because he was intelligent.

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,350
The doctors and pediatricians were also very
surprised; but they said that they didn't

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,870
know why Max slept so little.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,950
Then a child psychologist studied Max's case.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,150
He said that it wasn't a very strange case.

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,720
His studies showed that a lot of modern babies
were sleeping less.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
He wasn't sure why, but he had some ideas
about it.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,800
'Two hundred years ago people went to bed
earlier than today,' he told Samantha.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,930
'Generally, life was slower in the past and
people slept longer.

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,950
They worked a lot and they didn't have much
money, so they often stayed at home after

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,890
work and went to bed when it got dark.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,180
You see, there was no television and there
weren't any electric lights.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,530
Electric light is different from candlelight;
it is brighter and it keeps you awake.

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,290
Babies are influenced in mysterious ways by
the world.

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,310
And if the world is fast, noisy, and bright,
and if people often go to bed very late, babies

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,380
will feel this and they won't sleep so much.'

27
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,610
'Are you sure, Doctor?'

28
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,740
Samantha said.

29
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,959
'I think that Max doesn't sleep because he
finds the world so interesting.

30
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,390
He's very intelligent.'

31
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,060
'Yes, that's possible, Mrs Price.

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,099
But it's true that our society is becoming
more nocturnal.'

33
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,250
The psychologist's words surprised Samantha.

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,879
She couldn't believe him.

35
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,599
But when she told her husband Derek, he said,
'Yes, it seems crazy but our world is crazy!

36
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,959
The psychologist may be right.

37
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,900
But we'll see.

38
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,530
Perhaps it will pass and Max will sleep like
other babies.'

39
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,220
When Max was five, the doctors said he was
a hyperactive child.

40
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,569
Every night Samantha tried to put him to bed
at eight-thirty but he wasn't sleepy.

41
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,870
Samantha became angry; Derek was angry too.

42
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,629
They shouted at Max and finally he went to
bed at about half past nine.

43
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:14,010
But he cried and cried, and he never fell
asleep before eleven o'clock.

44
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,120
Then he woke up between four and five in the
morning and he wanted to play.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,150
Samantha and Derek were always tired and nervous.

46
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,599
When Max was eight, he slept about two hours
at night.

47
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,310
Now Samantha and Derek went to bed while he
continued to play quietly with his toys or

48
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,530
his computer.

49
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,019
He did lots of things to pass the time and
he didn't often feel bored.

50
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,999
He liked the electronic light of the TV or
computer.

51
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,890
He was always in the light!

52
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,419
If he was always in was in the dark for a
while, he became nervous and depressed.

53
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,430
It seemed that he needed light.

54
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,049
'I think he's a mutant,' Derek said one day,
and he laughed.

55
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,569
But he was half serious.

56
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,930
'What do you mean?' asked Samantha.

57
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:16,190
'Nature is trying to produce a new kind of
human and Max is an experiment,' Derek replied,

58
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,190
laughing.

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,290
'He's a child of the future.'

60
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,970
When Max was a teenager, he was awake for
most of the day.

61
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,480
At night he went to discos or all-night parties.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,640
He watched videos or late-night films on TV,
and he listened to music.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,690
He went to school every day, but he didn't
get up in the morning like other children.

64
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,100
At school his friends were surprised because
he wasn't sleepy.

65
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,880
And he worked hard.

66
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,600
He liked learning new things and he read a
lot of books.

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,940
He wanted to know all about life and the world.

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,850
When his friends asked him about this, he
said, 'I want to understand everything.

69
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,600
The world is a big, interesting place and
life is short.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
We sleep too much.

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,300
Sleep is a waste of time.'

72
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,560
Samantha and Derek were feeling better now
because they usually slept well.

73
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,590
Derek accepted Max's condition more than Samantha.

74
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,730
He said it was true that Max was different
but in other ways he was normal.

75
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,610
He liked sport, clothes, music and girls.

76
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,050
'How can you say he's normal?' said Samantha.

77
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,850
'A normal person can't always live in the
light of day or electricity.

78
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,200
Normal people can't live without sleep.

79
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,270
It's impossible!

80
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,430
Max must sleep or one day he will die!'

81
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,310
One evening Samantha put some strong sleeping
tablets in Max's tea to see what would happen.

82
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,860
When he began to look sleepy, she called Derek.

83
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
'Look!'

84
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
she said excitedly.

85
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,500
'He's going to fall asleep!'

86
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,310
Derek was surprised and happy.

87
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,350
'That's wonderful!

88
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,400
Perhaps he's normal after all!'

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
'Ssh!

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,630
You'll wake him up!'

91
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,510
After about half an hour Max opened his eyes.

92
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,120
'What's happening?' he said, looking around.

93
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,590
'You fell asleep,' said Derek with a big smile.

94
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,010
'Asleep?

95
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,430
Me?'

96
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,690
Max looked angry.

97
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,520
'How long?'

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,790
'About thirty minutes.'

99
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,790
'Oh no!

100
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,180
I don't want to sleep.

101
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,190
There's too much to do and see in the world.

102
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,060
But how did I fall asleep?'

103
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,870
Samantha said quietly, 'I gave you some sleeping
tablets.'

104
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,350
'You - what?'

105
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,000
Derek shouted.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,050
'Give them to me, Mum,' said Max.

107
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,090
Samantha looked very unhappy.

108
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,420
'Oh, you must sleep,

109
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Max!

110
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,000
Why don't you sleep?'

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,990
'I don't need it.

112
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,780
When you sleep, you don't know anything.

113
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,600
You can die in your sleep and you won't know
about it.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,830
When you sleep, you can't see or hear anything.

115
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,220
I don't like that.'

116
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,470
'But everybody in the world sleeps, Max!'

117
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,050
'I know - but not me.

118
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,810
I want to see, hear, and know.

119
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,950
Now give the tablets to me, Mum.'

120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,910
Slowly Samantha put the packet in his hand.

121
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,120
But she couldn't stop herself.

122
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,830
She was always thinking about Max's condition.

123
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,940
One day she wrote to a famous neurologist
who was an expert on sleep.

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:53,370
Dr Somaz answered her letter, asking if he
could do some tests on Max.

125
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,700
Max said yes.

126
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:01,340
After the tests, Dr Somaz said that Max's
brain waves were different.

127
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,880
'His brain produces very strong alpha waves,'
the doctor explained.

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,270
'These are the normal waves when we are awake.

129
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,340
But his brain doesn't produce any slow waves,
which are normal when we are asleep.

130
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,160
It's strange.

131
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,680
I've never seen this before.'

132
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,380
'So he really doesn't need sleep?' asked Derek.

133
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,029
'Sometimes perhaps - just a little.'

134
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,269
'And he is a normal, healthy person?'

135
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:36,409
Samantha asked.

136
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,180
'Yes, he is.

137
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,009
But there is a problem.

138
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:43,550
Sleep restores the body.

139
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,079
If the brain is always awake, the body is
not renewed.

140
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:54,740
And so... it will get old faster than normal...'

141
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,459
Samantha was looking at the doctor with big,
frightened eyes.

142
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:02,420
'Do you mean that Max will die young?'

143
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,410
'I don't know, Mrs Price, but it's possible.

144
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,170
I would like to do some more tests.'

145
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:19,900
Dr Somaz's tests showed that Max's body was
getting old faster than normal.

146
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,089
He was eighteen but he had the body of a man
of thirty-five.

147
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,759
Samantha and Derek were shocked.

148
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,110
'How long will he live?'

149
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,380
Derek asked.

150
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,680
'That's a very difficult question and I don't
know the answer.'

151
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,800
'Oh, isn't there anything we can do, Doctor?'

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,879
Samantha cried.

153
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,040
'How can we help him?'

154
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,350
Dr Somaz was silent for a moment.

155
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:56,230
'Well, I know of a drug that can make him
sleep.

156
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,130
But it's a very strong drug.

157
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:06,670
If he takes it for a long time - or if he
takes an overdose - it will kill him.

158
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,220
And it is addictive.

159
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,459
With time he will want more of it.'

160
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,350
Samantha and Derek said nothing.

161
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,100
They only looked at each other sadly.

162
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:27,040
'So if he takes this drug, he will live longer
- am I right?' said Derek.

163
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,829
'I'm not sure, Mr Price.

164
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:35,990
You see, he will be a drug addict and the
drug will kill him in the end.'

165
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,389
'Oh God, this is terrible!'

166
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,550
cried Samantha with big tears in her eyes.

167
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,690
'Which will kill him first - no sleep or the
drug?'

168
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,920
'Again I can't be certain,' replied Dr Somaz.

169
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,779
'I can only say that if my calculations are
right, it seems probable that without sleep

170
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:03,019
he will die younger than if he takes the drug.'

171
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:09,939
After a silence, Derek said, 'We must tell
poor Max all this and he can decide what he

172
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:11,279
wants to do.'

173
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,370
'He won't take the drug,' said Samantha, shaking
her head.

174
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,550
'Are you sure?' asked Dr Somaz.

175
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,620
'Yes.

176
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,499
He says he wants to stay awake, he wants to
live with his eyes open.

177
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:36,569
He told us that life is too short to sleep
because there is so much to learn and do.

178
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,850
He will never take any drugs.'

179
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,149
'But you and Mr Price must tell him that it's
better to take the drug,' Dr Somaz said.

180
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:52,089
'When he understands the problem, perhaps
he will decide to take it.'

181
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,189
That night Samantha and Derek talked to Max.

182
00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:01,230
They told him the situation and said that
Dr Somaz thought it would be better for him

183
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,329
to take the drug.

184
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,279
'And what do you think?'

185
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,579
Max asked them.

186
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,869
'We agree with the doctor,' said Derek.

187
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,990
'No,' said Max.

188
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,149
'I won't take any drugs.'

189
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,610
'Take your time, Max,' said Derek.

190
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,220
'Think about it.'

191
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,709
'The answer is no.

192
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,850
I don't want to spend half my life sleeping
in darkness.

193
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,560
I prefer to live for a short time awake in
the light.

194
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,459
The world is a miracle and I don't want to
miss any of it.'

195
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:40,329
'But Dr Somaz said you will be dead before
you are forty,' said Samantha, beginning to

196
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:42,459
cry.

197
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,459
Max smiled.

198
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,949
'The number of years I live is not important.

199
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,540
How I live is more important.

200
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,839
What I do and what I am is more important.'

201
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,790
Samantha was very unhappy.

202
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,139
'Oh Max, my darling boy - please take the
drug!'

203
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,160
'I'm sorry, Mum, but I can't.'

204
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,690
Then Max smiled.

205
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,290
'Will you excuse me now?

206
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,180
If I'm going to die young, I haven't got much
time.'

207
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,310
So Max continued to work and play and live
fast.

208
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,940
But he lived a quiet, clean life.

209
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,180
He didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and he didn't
eat too much.

210
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,430
He didn't worry about small things; he didn't
think about money.

211
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,779
And he didn't waste time.

212
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,720
He travelled lot and looked carefully at the
world and people.

213
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,600
They interested him.

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,050
And he studied hard.

215
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:48,740
He was always bright and awake; he always
wanted to learn new things.

216
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,910
The medical experts said that Max's body and
brain were not influenced by the diurnal rhythm,

217
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,110
like every animal on earth.

218
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,369
'I'm sure he's from another planet,' laughed
Derek.

219
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:05,990
He liked Max's strange condition now; it was
different.

220
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,220
But Samantha didn't like it.

221
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,970
She did everything possible to make Max normal.

222
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,999
For years, only a few doctors and scientists
knew about Max's condition.

223
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,249
Samantha and Derek didn't tell anybody.

224
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:24,209
It was a big secret.

225
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,540
So Max lived quietly and he was happy.

226
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,579
When he left school, he got a job in a bank.

227
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:39,339
Then he met a girl called Wendy and they fell
in love and got married.

228
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,050
Max was thirty years old.

229
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,600
He didn't tell Wendy about his condition so
she didn't know anything.

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,309
But she began to notice things, and one day
she told Samantha that Max didn't sleep much

231
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,240
but he was never tired.

232
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,249
The two women talked, and finally Samantha
told Wendy the secret.

233
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:04,910
Wendy was shocked and amazed.

234
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,670
'Is Max really going to die before he's forty?'

235
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,170
'Nobody knows.

236
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:17,089
Dr Somaz said that if he lives quietly, he
will probably live longer.

237
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,370
But listen, Wendy!

238
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,709
You must not tell anybody about this - not
even your friends.

239
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:25,709
Nobody must know.

240
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,639
It's a big secret.'

241
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,809
'Why?' said Wendy.

242
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:34,600
'Because he must live quietly.

243
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,649
Then he will be happy and he will live longer.

244
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:43,029
So the world must never know, especially the
newspapers and magazines.

245
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,649
They must never, never know!

246
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,860
Do you understand, Wendy?

247
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,439
You must never say anything to the media.

248
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,439
Promise?'

249
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:58,189
'Yes, all right, I promise,' Wendy answered.

250
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:05,800
Wendy was a good person and a good wife, but
she liked money and she liked a lot of it.

251
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,069
She loved spending money!

252
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:14,259
So when she saw beautiful clothes in the shops,
she was often angry because she couldn't buy

253
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,749
them.

254
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:19,550
Max didn't get a lot of money as a bank clerk.

255
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,989
So Wendy began to think.

256
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:27,129
She thought, 'I'm going to have a child soon.

257
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,529
If Max dies before he is forty, what will
happen to us?

258
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,949
I must think about the future.'

259
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:39,029
One day she decided to speak to Max about
it.

260
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:44,259
At first he was angry because she knew his
secret; then he smiled.

261
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,370
'Wendy, my love, don't think about the future.

262
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,089
We love each other and we are happy.

263
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,709
That's very important!

264
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,959
You see, nothing is certain.

265
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,449
Perhaps I won't die young.

266
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:06,140
But I promise that when I die, you will have
enough money.'

267
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,220
But Wendy had a different idea.

268
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,449
She thought about it for a few days and then
she went to the office of a big national newspaper

269
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:22,140
and said that she wanted to tell them an incredible
story.

270
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,730
Of course, she got thousands of pounds for
the story.

271
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,059
And when the world heard about Max, the world
wanted him.

272
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,100
America, Japan, Australia, Europe...

273
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,370
interviews, articles, talk shows, documentaries...

274
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,600
The public and the media were fascinated.

275
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:51,299
In a few days Max became world- famous - and
Wendy became very rich.

276
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:56,220
He tried to hide, he tried to escape from
all the noise and attention.

277
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:03,320
He ran away, but the media always found him.

278
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,940
Samantha knew that this was a very bad thing
for Max and she was furious with Wendy.

279
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,480
But it was too late.

280
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,880
The TV journalists and personalities, the
newspapers and magazines followed him everywhere.

281
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,070
Film directors offered him millions of dollars
to appear in their films.

282
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,980
Big film stars and rock singers wanted to
meet him.

283
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,110
Max became unhappy; he became ill.

284
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,490
He didn't eat and he got very thin.

285
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,500
He lost his concentration and he stopped working
hard.

286
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,590
He also lost his interest in the world, in
people, in life.

287
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,450
He didn't want to learn new things.

288
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,990
He locked himself in his room and sat alone
night and day.

289
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,080
And Wendy continued to spend the money.

290
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,269
One day Samantha visited him and she was shocked
because he had changed a lot.

291
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,500
He looked grey and tired.

292
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,900
He looked old.

293
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,029
His eyes were heavy and there were dark shadows
under them.

294
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:27,950
Then, while Samantha was talking to him, the
impossible happened: he yawned.

295
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,640
She couldn't believe her eyes.

296
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,620
'Are you sleepy, Max?'

297
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,240
she asked.

298
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,420
'Yes.

299
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,330
I want to sleep.'

300
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,210
And in a few moments he was asleep.

301
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,490
He slept for a few hours.

302
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,649
But when he woke up, he was still tired.

303
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:52,280
A few days later he slept again.

304
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,730
And then little by little he began to sleep
like a normal person.

305
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,190
'You sleep eight hours a day now, Max,' Samantha
said, frightened.

306
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,440
'What's happening to you?'

307
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,500
'I don't know,' he replied.

308
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,080
'I feel tired.

309
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,820
I need to sleep.'

310
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,539
'But why?'

311
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,920
'Because I don't want to stay awake now.

312
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,090
The world is boring; people are boring.

313
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,240
It's better to sleep.'

314
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,269
When he fell asleep quickly, Samantha went
home.

315
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,110
She was very anxious and very unhappy.

316
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,309
Now Max was beginning to sleep more than a
normal person!

317
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,770
He had no more bright energy, no more interest
in life.

318
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,289
He just seemed very tired.

319
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:55,900
Now the public and the media were completely
obsessed with Max.

320
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,760
Photographers stood outside his house all
day and night and took photos of Max when

321
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,300
he yawned and when he was asleep.

322
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:11,059
Every day Wendy told reporters what Max was
doing - for a fee, of course.

323
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:16,970
All round the world people knew what Max was
doing every minute of the day.

324
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:23,919
They tried to telephone him, they sent letters,
telegrams and presents.

325
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,620
Samantha said to herself, 'If this continues,
Max will die.

326
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,130
It must stop.'

327
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,760
She thought about it day and night.

328
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,220
And then one day she decided to appear on
a TV chat show.

329
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,809
'He's very ill,' she said in the studio.

330
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,809
'You must all leave him alone.'

331
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,559
'Why is he ill?'

332
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,080
the interviewer asked.

333
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,620
'Is the drug killing him?'

334
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,200
'No, he doesn't take any drugs!' said Samantha
angrily.

335
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,370
'It's you - the newspaper and TV people - and
you - the public!

336
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,460
You have destroyed his peace and his world
with all your noise and gossip.

337
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,100
You won't let him live quietly.

338
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:19,429
He always lived in the light with his eyes
open but you have pulled him down into your

339
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:22,480
darkness and he has closed his eyes.

340
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,850
You - the media and the public - are killing
Max with your stupidity.

341
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,070
Leave him alone!'

342
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,960
The media and the public were very angry.

343
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,909
Next day there was a lot of anger about it
on TV and in the newspapers.

344
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:43,570
'Us?' one newspaper article began.

345
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,679
'Is Max Price's mother accusing us?

346
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:53,880
Yes, she is saying that we - the people and
the press - are destroying her son.

347
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,250
But isn't he rich now?

348
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,350
And isn't he famous?

349
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,889
Hasn't Mrs Price asked herself who made him
rich and famous?

350
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:04,220
We are innocent, Mrs Price.

351
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,210
We have helped your son.

352
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,140
You told us to leave him alone.

353
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,070
But we live in a democracy.

354
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,880
We have a right to know about Max Price.

355
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,470
We demand to know about him!...'

356
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,530
Etcetera, etcetera.

357
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:25,380
When Samantha left the TV studio, she went
to Max's house.

358
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,039
Wendy told her that he was sleeping so she
went home.

359
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,659
Next day Wendy phoned Samantha.

360
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:42,509
'I'm frightened,' she said.

361
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,880
'Max is still sleeping.

362
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,570
Please come!'

363
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:54,650
When Samantha arrived, there were reporters
and photographers and two TV cameras outside

364
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,799
the house.

365
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,250
She pushed her way to the door and went in.

366
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,980
Wendy was sitting on the sofa.

367
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,389
She looked terrified.

368
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:08,720
'Why doesn't he wake up?'

369
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,760
she cried.

370
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,530
The women went upstairs to Max's room.

371
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,390
He was in bed.

372
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,220
His eyes were closed; his face was very pale.

373
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,990
Samantha touched him.

374
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,269
'He's very cold,' she said.

375
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:30,509
'Call Dr Somaz.'

376
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,649
Dr Somaz came and began to examine Max.

377
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:37,330
Just then Derek arrived.

378
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,549
'There's a very big crowd outside,' he said.

379
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,100
Then he saw that the women were crying.

380
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,100
He looked at Dr Somaz, who said to him:

381
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,779
'Tell the people to go away.

382
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:55,390
Max is dead.'

383
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,809
Next day Max's death was big news all over
the world.

384
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:07,039
The newspapers, the magazines, and the TV
news all had the same opinion.

385
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,340
'The boy who couldn't sleep has finally found
eternal rest.

386
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,409
As the doctors always said, he died before
he was forty.

387
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,480
This shows that the people and the media are
not responsible.'

388
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
 

389
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,482
- THE END -
