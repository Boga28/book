CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,440
An Extraordinarily Beautiful Young Man

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,000
The room was filled with the smell of roses.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,360
Sitting on a sofa, smoking a 
cigarette, was Lord Henry Wotton.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,000
Through the open door came the 
distant sounds of the London streets.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,240
In the centre of the room stood a portrait 
of an extraordinarily beautiful young man.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,320
Sitting a little distance in front of it 
was the artist himself, Basil Hallward.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,320
As the painter looked at the portrait, he smiled.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,600
'It is your best work, Basil, the best thing 
you have ever done,' said Lord Henry, slowly.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,080
'You really must send it 
next year to the Grosvenor.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,080
The Grosvenor is really the only place 
to exhibit a painting like that.'

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,080
'I don't think I shall send it 
anywhere,' the painter answered,  

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,280
moving his head in that odd way that used to make 
his friends laugh at him at Oxford University.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,120
'No: I won't send it anywhere.'

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
Lord Henry looked at him in surprise through 
the thin blue smoke of his cigarette.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,440
'Not send it anywhere? My dear man, why 
not? What odd people you painters are!'

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,880
'I know you will laugh at me,' Basil 
replied, 'but I really can't exhibit it.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,160
I have put too much of myself into it.'

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,680
Lord Henry stretched himself 
out on the sofa and laughed.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,640
'Too much of yourself in it! 
Basil, this man is truly beautiful.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
He does not look like you.'

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,080
'You don't understand me, 
Harry,' answered the artist.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,400
'Of course I am not like him.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
I would be sorry to look like him.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
It is better not to be 
different from other people.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,760
The stupid and ugly have the best of this world.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,720
Dorian Gray -'

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,080
'Dorian Gray? Is that his name?' asked Lord Henry, 
walking across the room towards Basil Hallward.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,880
'Yes, that is his name.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,880
I wasn't going to tell you.'

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,880
'But why not?'

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
'Oh, I can't explain.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,320
When I like people enormously I 
never tell their names to anyone.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
I suppose you think that's very foolish?'

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,840
'Not at all,' answered Lord 
Henry, 'not at all, my dear Basil.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,240
You forget that I am married, 
so my life is full of secrets.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,160
I never know where my wife is, and 
my wife never knows what I am doing.

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,520
When we meet we tell each other 
lies with the most serious faces.'

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
'I hate the way you talk about 
your married life, Harry,'  

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
said Basil Hallward, walking towards 
the door that led into the garden.

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
'I believe you are really a very good 
husband, but that you are ashamed of it.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
You never say a good thing, and 
you never do a wrong thing.'

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,320
Lord Henry laughed and the two men 
went out into the garden together.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,360
After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,200
'I am afraid I have to go, 
Basil,' he said in a quiet voice.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,400
'But before I go I want you to explain to me 
why you won't exhibit Dorian Grays picture.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,800
I want the real reason.'

48
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
'I told you the real reason.'

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,840
'No, you did not.

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
You said that it was because there 
was too much of yourself in it.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,640
Now, that is childish.'

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,160
'Harry,' said Basil Hallward, 
looking him straight in the face,  

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,720
'every portrait that is painted with feeling 
is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter.

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
I will not exhibit this picture because I  

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,120
am afraid that I have shown in 
it the secret of my own soul.'

56
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,920
Lord Henry laughed.

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,040
'And what is that?' he asked.

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,720
'Oh, there is really very little to tell,  

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,960
Harry,' answered the painter, 'and 
I don't think you will understand.

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
Perhaps you won't believe it.'

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Lord Henry smiled and picked 
a flower from the grass.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,360
'I am quite sure I'll understand it,' 
he replied, staring at the flower,'  

63
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
and I can believe anything.'

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,760
'The story is simply this,' said the painter.

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
'Two months ago I went to 
a party at Lady Brandon's.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
After I had been in the 
room for about ten minutes,  

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,800
I suddenly realized that 
someone was looking at me.

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,200
I turned around and saw Dorian 
Gray for the first time.

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
When our eyes met, I felt 
the blood leaving my face.

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,840
I knew that this boy would become 
my whole soul, my whole art itself.'

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
'What did you do?'

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
'We were quite close, almost touching.

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
Our eyes met again.

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.'

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
'What did Lady Brandon say about Mr Dorian Gray?'

76
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
'Oh, something like "Charming boy.

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,920
I don't know what he does - I 
think he doesn't do anything.

78
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,640
Oh, yes, he plays the piano - or 
is it the violin, dear Mr Gray?"  

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
Dorian and I both laughed and 
we became friends at once.'

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,080
'Laughter is not at all a bad beginning 
for a friendship,' said the young lord,  

81
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,320
picking another flower, 'and 
it is the best ending for one.'

82
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
Hallward shook his head.

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
'You don't understand what friendship is, Harry.

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
Everyone is the same to you.'

85
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,000
'That's not true!' cried Lord Henry, pushing 
his hat back, and looking at the summer sky.

86
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,240
'I choose my friends for their beauty 
and my enemies for their intelligence.

87
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,080
A man cannot be too careful 
in choosing his enemies.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
Of course, I hate my relations.

89
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,040
And I hate poor people because 
they are ugly, stupid and drunk -'

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,080
'I don't agree with a word you have said.

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
And I feel sure that you don't agree either.'

92
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Lord Henry touched his pointed 
brown beard with his finger,  

93
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
and the toe of his boot with his stick.

94
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,960
'How English you are, Basil! An Englishman is 
only interested in whether he agrees with an idea,  

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,640
not whether it is right or wrong.

96
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
But tell me more about Mr Dorian Gray.

97
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,920
How often do you see him?'

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,560
'Every day.

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,920
I couldn't be happy if I 
didn't see him every day.'

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
'How extraordinary! I thought 
you only cared about your art.'

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
'He is all my art to me now,' said the painter.

102
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,000
'I know that the work I have done since I 
met Dorian Gray is the best work of my life.

103
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
In some strange way his personality 
has shown me a new kind of art.

104
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,320
He seems like a little boy - though 
he is really more than twenty - and  

105
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,200
when he is with me I see the world differently.'

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,840
'Basil, this is extraordinary! 
I must see Dorian Gray.'

107
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
Hallward got up from his seat and 
walked up and down the garden.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
After some time he came back.

109
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,640
'Harry,' he said.

110
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
'Dorian Gray is the reason for my art.

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
You might see nothing in him.

112
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
I see everything in him.'

113
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
'Then why won't you exhibit his 
portrait?' asked Lord Henry.

114
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,960
'An artist should paint beautiful things, but 
he should put nothing of his own life into them.

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Some day I will show the 
world what that beauty is.

116
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,840
For that reason the world will never 
see my portrait of Dorian Gray.'

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,400
'I think you are wrong, Basil, 
but I won't argue with you.

118
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,720
Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?'

119
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,840
The painter thought for a few moments.

120
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,920
'He likes me,' he answered, after a pause.

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,120
'I know he likes me.

122
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,240
Of course I flatter him too much and 
tell him things that I should not.

123
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,920
He is usually very charming to me, and we 
spend thousands of wonderful hours together.

124
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,400
But sometimes he can be horribly thoughtless 
and seems to enjoy causing me pain.

125
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Then I feel, Harry, that I have given my whole  

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
soul to someone who uses it like a flower 
to put in his coat on a summer's day.'

127
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,640
'Summer days are long, Basil,' 
said Lord Henry in a quiet voice.

128
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,160
'Perhaps you will get bored before he will.

129
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,200
Intelligence lives longer than beauty.

130
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
One day you will look at your friend and 
you won't like his colour or something.

131
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
And then you will begin to think that 
he has behaved badly towards you -'

132
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
'Harry, don't talk like that.

133
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,640
As long as I live, Dorian 
Gray will be everything to me.

134
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
You can't feel what I feel.

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
You change too often.'

136
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,320
'My dear Basil, that is 
exactly why I can feel it.'

137
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Lord Henry took a cigarette from 
his pretty silver box and lit it.

138
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,240
Then he turned to Hallward and 
said, 'I have just remembered.'

139
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,280
'Remembered what, Harry?'

140
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,040
'Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.'

141
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,280
'Where was it?' asked Hallward with a frown.

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
'Don't look so angry, Basil.

143
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
It was at my aunt's, Lady Agatha's.

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
She told me that she had discovered 
this wonderful young man.

145
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,720
He was going to help her work with the 
poor people in the East End of London,  

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
and his name was Dorian Gray.

147
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
Of course I didn't know it was your friend.'

148
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
'I am very glad you didn't, Harry.'

149
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,080
'Why?'

150
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
'I don't want you to meet him.'

151
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
A servant came into the garden.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,440
'Mr Dorian Gray is waiting 
in the house, sir,' he said.

153
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,480
'You must introduce me now,' 
cried Lord Henry, laughing.

154
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
The painter turned to his servant.

155
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
'Ask Mr Gray to wait, Parker.

156
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
I will come in in a few moments.'

157
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,520
Then he looked at Lord Henry.

158
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,240
'Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,' he said.

159
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
'He is a beautiful person.

160
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,920
Don't spoil him.

161
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
Don't try and influence him.

162
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
Your influence would be bad.

163
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
Don't take away from me the one 
person who makes me a true artist.'

164
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,240
'What silly things you say!' said Lord Henry.

165
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Smiling, he took Hallward by the arm 
and almost led him into the house.

166
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,640
CHAPTER TWO

167
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Jealous of his Own Portrait

168
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,960
As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.

169
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,400
He was sitting at the piano, 
with his back to them,  

170
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,280
and he was turning the pages 
of some music by Schumann.

171
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,840
'You must lend me these, Basil,' he cried.

172
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,200
'I want to learn them.

173
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
They are perfectly charming.'

174
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,280
'Perhaps if you sit well for me today, Dorian.'

175
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,880
'Oh, I am bored with sitting, and 
I don't want a portrait of myself,'  

176
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
answered the boy, turning quickly.

177
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,040
When he saw Lord Henry, his 
face went red for a moment.

178
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,840
'I am sorry, Basil.

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
I didn't know that you had anyone with you.'

180
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,640
'This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian.

181
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
He's an old friend of mine.

182
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
We went to Oxford together.

183
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,200
I have just been telling him what a good sitter 
you were, and now you have spoiled everything.'

184
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,720
'You have not spoiled my pleasure 
in meeting you, Mr Gray,'  

185
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
said Lord Henry, stepping 
forward and offering his hand.

186
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,280
'My aunt has often spoken to me about you.'

187
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,160
'I am afraid Lady Agatha is 
annoyed with me at the moment.

188
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,400
I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with 
her last Tuesday, and I forgot all about it.

189
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't know what she will say to me.'

190
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,920
Lord Henry looked at him.

191
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, he was certainly wonderfully 
handsome, with his curved red lips,  

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
honest blue eyes and gold hair.

193
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
'Oh, don't worry about my aunt.

194
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,640
You are one of her favourite people.

195
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,320
And you are too charming to waste 
time working tor poor people.'

196
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Lord Henry sat down on the sofa 
and opened his cigarette box.

197
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
The painter was busy mixing colours 
and getting his brushes ready.

198
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,320
Suddenly, he looked at Lord Henry and said, 
'Harry, I want to finish this picture today.

199
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
Would you think it very rude of 
me if I asked you to go away?'

200
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,880
Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian Gray.

201
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,520
'Shall I go, Mr Gray?' he asked.

202
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,640
'Oh, please don't, Lord Henry.

203
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,240
I see that Basil is in one of his difficult 
moods, and I hate it when he is difficult.

204
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,560
And I want you to tell me why I 
should not help the poor people.'

205
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
'That would be very boring, Mr Gray.

206
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,960
But I certainly will not run 
away if you do not want me to.

207
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,880
Is that all right, Basil? You have often told  

208
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,680
me that you like your sitters 
to have someone to talk to.'

209
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
Hallward bit his lip.

210
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
'If that is what Dorian wants.

211
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,920
Dorian always gets what he wants.'

212
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
Lord Henry picked up his hat and gloves.

213
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
'No, I am afraid I must go.

214
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
Goodbye, Mr Gray.

215
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Come and see me one afternoon in Curzon Street.

216
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
I am nearly always at home at five o'clock.'

217
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,800
'Basil,' cried Dorian Gray, 'If Lord 
Henry Wotton goes, I will go too.

218
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720
You never open your lips while you are painting, 
and it is horribly boring just standing here.

219
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
Ask him to stay.'

220
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,360
'All right, please stay, Harry.

221
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,280
For Dorian and for me,' said 
Hallward, staring at his picture.

222
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,400
'It is true that I never talk when I 
am working, and never listen either.

223
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
It must be very boring for my sitters.

224
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,880
Sit down again, Harry.

225
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,160
And Dorian don't move about too much, 
or listen to what Lord Henry says.

226
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,320
He has a very bad influence over all his friends.'

227
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,520
Dorian Gray stood while 
Hallward finished his portrait.

228
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,040
He liked what he had seen of Lord Henry.

229
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
He was so different to Basil!

230
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,440
And he had such a beautiful voice.

231
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,960
After a few moments he said to him, 'Have 
you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry?  

232
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
As bad as Basil says?'

233
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,520
'Influence is always bad.'

234
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,280
'Why?'

235
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,520
'Because to influence someone 
is to give them your soul.

236
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Each person must have his own personality.'

237
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
'Turn your head a little more to the 
right, Dorian,' said the painter.

238
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,840
He was not listening to the conversation and only 
knew that there was a new look on the boy's face.

239
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,160
'And yet,' continued Lord 
Henry, in his low musical voice,  

240
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,360
'I believe that if one man lived his life 
fully and completely he could change the world.

241
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,400
He would be a work of art greater 
than anything we have ever imagined.

242
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,880
But the bravest man among us is afraid of himself.

243
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,640
You, Mr Gray, are very young but you have had 
passions that have made you afraid, dreams -'

244
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,520
'Stop!' cried Dorian Gray, 'I don't 
understand what you are saying.

245
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,280
I need to think.'

246
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,280
For nearly ten minutes he stood there with 
his lips open and his eyes strangely bright.

247
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,000
The words that Basil's friend 
had spoken had touched his soul.

248
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,600
Yes, there had been things in his 
boyhood that he had not understood.

249
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,000
He understood them now.

250
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,360
With his smile, Lord Henry watched him.

251
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,080
He knew the exact moment when to say nothing.

252
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,920
He was surprised at the sudden 
effect of his words on the boy.

253
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
How fascinating the boy was!

254
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,920
Hallward continued painting and did 
not notice that the others were silent.

255
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,440
"Basil, I am tired,' cried Dorian Gray, suddenly.

256
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
'I must go and sit in the garden.

257
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,440
There is no air in here.'

258
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,560
'My dear boy, I am sorry.

259
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
When I am painting, my work 
is all I can think about.

260
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,320
But you never sat better.

261
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,480
I don't know what Harry has been saying to you, 
but there is a wonderful bright look in your eyes.

262
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,280
I suppose he has been flattering you.

263
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,840
You shouldn't believe a word he says.'

264
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
'He has certainly not been flattering me.

265
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
Perhaps that is why I don't 
believe anything he has told me.'

266
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,280
'You know you believe it all,' said Lord 
Henry, looking at him with his dreamy eyes.

267
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
'I will go out to the garden with you.

268
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
It's horribly hot in this room.'

269
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,760
'Don't keep Dorian too long,' said the painter.

270
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
'This is going to be my best painting.'

271
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,720
Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found 
Dorian Gray holding a flower to his face.

272
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,840
He came close to him, and 
put his hand on his shoulder.

273
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
Dorian Gray frowned and turned away.

274
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,280
He liked the tall young man 
who was standing by him.

275
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,800
His dark, romantic face interested him.

276
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,880
There was something in his low, 
musical voice that was fascinating.

277
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,680
But he felt a little afraid.

278
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Why was this stranger having a 
strong influence on him like this?

279
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,400
He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the 
friendship between them had not changed him.

280
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,120
Suddenly someone had come into his 
life and turned it upside down.

281
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
Someone who seemed to have the 
key to the mystery of life itself.

282
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,840
And yet, what was there to be afraid of?

283
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,480
He was not a schoolboy or a girl.

284
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,720
It was silly to be afraid.

285
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,440
'Let us go and sit out of the sun.

286
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
I don't want you to be burnt by the sun.'

287
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,800
'What does that matter?' cried Dorian Gray,  

288
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,920
laughing as he sat down on the 
seat at the end of the garden.

289
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,920
'It should matter very much to you, Mr Gray.'

290
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,600
'Why?'

291
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,800
'Because you are young, and to be 
young is the best thing in the world.'

292
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
'I don't feel that, Lord Henry.'

293
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
'No, you don't feel it now.

294
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Some day when you are old and 
ugly you will feel it terribly.

295
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Now, wherever you go, you charm the world.

296
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,600
Will it always be so?...

297
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,560
You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr Gray.'

298
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,920
'I don't think -'

299
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,880
'Don't frown.

300
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,400
It is true.

301
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,560
The gods have been good to you.

302
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,320
But what the gods give they quickly take away.

303
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,840
You have only a few years in which 
to really live, perfectly and fully.

304
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
Live your life now, while you are still young!'

305
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,160
Suddenly the painter appeared at the 
door and waved at them to come in.

306
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
They turned to each other and smiled.

307
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,640
'I am waiting,' he cried.

308
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,080
'Please come in.

309
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
The light is perfect.'

310
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,000
They got up and walked towards the house together.

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,320
'You are glad you have met me, Mr 
Gray,' said Lord Henry, looking at him.

312
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,360
'Yes, I am glad now.

313
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,240
I wonder whether I will always be glad.'

314
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,440
'Always! That is a terrible word.

315
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Women are so fond of using it.'

316
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
Twenty minutes later Hallward stopped painting.

317
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,280
He stood back and looked at 
the portrait for a few moments.

318
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,800
Then he bent down and signed his name in 
red paint on the bottom left-hand corner.

319
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,560
'It is finished,' he cried.

320
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.

321
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,280
It was certainly a wonderful work of art.

322
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
'My dear man,' he said.

323
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
'It is the best portrait of our time.

324
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,080
Mr Gray, come over and look at yourself.'

325
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Dorian walked across to look at the painting.

326
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,320
When he saw it his cheeks went red with pleasure.

327
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
He felt that he recognized his 
own beauty for the first time.

328
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,280
But then he remembered what Lord Henry had said.

329
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,040
His beauty would only be there for a few years.

330
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,960
One day he would be old and ugly.

331
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
'Don't you like it?' cried Hallward, not 
understanding why the boy was silent.

332
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,440
'Of course he likes it,' said Lord Henry.

333
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,800
'It is one of the greatest 
paintings in modern art.

334
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,920
I will pay anything you ask for it.

335
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
I must have it.'

336
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,720
'It is not mine to sell, Harry.'

337
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
'Whose is it?'

338
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
'Dorian's, of course,' answered the painter.

339
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
'He is very lucky.'

340
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,480
'How sad it is!' said Dorian Gray, who 
was still staring at his own portrait.

341
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
'I will grow old and horrible.

342
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
But this painting will always stay young.

343
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,160
It will never be older than this day in June...

344
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
if only it were the other way!'

345
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,840
'What do you mean?' asked Hallward.

346
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:16,480
'If I could stay young and the picture grow old! 
For that - for that - I would give everything!  

347
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I 
would not give! I would give my soul for that!'

348
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,160
'I don't think you would like that, 
Basil,' cried Lord Henry, laughing.

349
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
'I certainly would not, Harry,' said Hallward.

350
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.

351
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,640
'You like your art better than your friends.'

352
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
The painter stared in surprise.

353
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
Why was Dorian speaking like that?

354
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,160
What had happened?

355
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,840
His face was red, and he seemed quite angry.

356
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
'You will always like this painting.

357
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,480
But how long will you like me?

358
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
Until I start getting old.

359
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right.

360
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
When I lose my beauty, I will lose everything.

361
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,360
I shall kill myself before I get old.'

362
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,600
Hallward turned white, and caught his hand.

363
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,800
'Dorian! Dorian!' he cried.

364
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
'Don't talk like that.

365
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,880
I have never had a friend like 
you, and I will never have another.

366
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,880
How can you be jealous of a painting? You 
are more beautiful than any work of art.'

367
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,840
'I am jealous of everything 
whose beauty does not die.

368
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,600
I am jealous of the portrait 
you have painted of me.

369
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,800
Why should it keep what I must lose?'  

370
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,080
Hot tears came into his eyes as 
he threw himself on the sofa.

371
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,040
'You did this, Harry,' said the painter, angrily.

372
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
Lord Henry shook his head.

373
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,040
'It is the real Dorian Gray - that is all.'

374
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
'Harry, I can't argue with two 
of my best friends at once.

375
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,600
Between you both you have made me hate 
the best piece of work I have ever done.

376
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,600
I will destroy it.'

377
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,080
Dorian Gray watched as Hallward walked over 
to the painting- table and picked up a knife.

378
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,040
The boy jumped from the sofa, tore the knife from 
Hallward's hand and threw it across the room.

379
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
'Don't, Basil!' he cried.

380
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,840
'Don't murder it!'

381
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,800
'I am glad that you like my work at 
last, Dorian,' said the painter coldly.

382
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,040
'I never thought you would.'

383
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,840
'Like it? I am in love with it, Basil.

384
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
It is part of myself.

385
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,360
I feel that.'

386
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,280
'What silly people you are, 
both of you!' said Lord Henry.

387
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,400
'Let's forget about the painting for 
one night and go to the theatre.'

388
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,880
'I would like to come to the 
theatre with you, Lord Henry.'

389
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,240
'And you will come too, won't you Basil?'

390
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
'I can't,' said Hallward.

391
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,840
'I have too much work to do.'

392
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,480
'Well, you and I will go together, Mr Gray.'

393
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,160
The painter bit his lip and 
walked over to the picture.

394
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,200
'I will stay with the real Dorian,' he said sadly.

395
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,480
CHAPTER THREE

396
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,680
Dorian in Love

397
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,520
One afternoon, a month later, 
Dorian Gray was sitting in the  

398
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,400
little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.

399
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Lord Henry had not yet come in.

400
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,200
He was always late.

401
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Dorian Gray was bored and once or 
twice he thought of going away.

402
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
At last he heard a step 
outside and the door opened.

403
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,560
'How late you are, Harry!' he said.

404
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,400
'I'm afraid it is not Harry, Mr Gray.

405
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,240
It is only his wife.'

406
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
He looked around quickly and got to his feet.

407
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,680
'I am sorry.

408
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,440
I thought -'

409
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,680
'I know you quite well by your photographs.

410
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,000
I think my husband has got seventeen of them.'

411
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
'Seventeen, Lady Henry?'

412
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
'Well, eighteen, then.

413
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,680
And I saw you with him the 
other night at the theatre.

414
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
But here is Harry!'

415
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,920
Lord Henry smiled at them both.

416
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,600
'So sorry I am late, Dorian.'

417
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,760
'I am afraid I must go,' said Lady Harry.

418
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,280
'Goodbye, Mr Gray.

419
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,720
Goodbye, Harry.

420
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,280
You are eating out, I suppose?

421
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,920
I am too.

422
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,840
Perhaps I will see you later.'

423
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,040
'Perhaps, my dear,' said Lord 
Harry, shutting the door behind her.

424
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,360
Then he lit a cigarette and 
threw himself down on the sofa.

425
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,880
'Never marry a woman with 
fair hair, Dorian,' he said.

426
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,720
'Why, Harry?'

427
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,120
'Because they are romantic.'

428
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,240
'But I like romantic people.'

429
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
'Never marry at all, Dorian.'

430
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
'I don't think I will marry, Harry.

431
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,040
I am too much in love.'

432
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,640
'Who are you in love with?' 
asked Lord Henry, after a pause.

433
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,080
'With an actress,' said Dorian Gray.

434
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
'How ordinary.'

435
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880
'You would not say that if you saw her, Harry.'

436
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,120
'Who is she?'

437
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
'Her name is Sibyl Vane.'

438
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,920
'I've never heard of her.'

439
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,640
'No one has.

440
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,120
People will some day, though.

441
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,800
She is an artist.'

442
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,600
'My dear boy, no woman is an artist.

443
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,160
Women never have anything to 
say but they say it charmingly.

444
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,640
How long have you known her?'

445
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
'About three weeks.'

446
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,440
'And where did you meet her?'

447
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,360
'I will tell you, Harry, but you must not laugh.

448
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,480
After all, it was you who gave me a 
passion to know everything about life.

449
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,840
For days after I met you I 
searched the streets for beauty.

450
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,320
I walked around the East End until 
I found a dirty little theatre.

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,040
I see you are laughing.

452
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,320
It is horrible of you!'

453
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,760
'I am not laughing, Dorian.

454
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040
Go on with your story.'

455
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,400
'The play was Romeo and Juliet.

456
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,760
At first I was annoyed at the thought of 
seeing Shakespeare in such a terrible place.

457
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,960
And when a fat old gentleman came 
out as Romeo I nearly walked out.

458
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:56,000
But then I saw Juliet! Harry, she was the 
loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life.'

459
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
'When did you meet her?'

460
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,440
'I went back the next night 
and the night after that.

461
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,840
On the third evening I waited 
for her outside the theatre.'

462
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,840
'What was she like?'

463
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,080
'Sibyl? Oh, she was shy and gentle.

464
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,760
She is only seventeen and there 
is something of a child in her.

465
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,840
She said to me, "You look like a prince.

466
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,080
I must call you Prince Charming".'

467
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,840
'Miss Sibyl knows how to flatter you.'

468
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,880
'You don't understand her, Harry.

469
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,000
She thinks that I am like a person in Shakespeare.

470
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,160
She knows nothing of life.

471
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,440
Sibyl is the only thing I care about.'

472
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,640
'That is the reason, I suppose, that 
you never have dinner with me now.

473
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I thought it might be something romantic.'

474
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,560
'My dear Harry, we eat together 
every day,' said Dorian.

475
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
'You always come very late.'

476
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,200
'Well, I have to see Sibyl play,' he cried.

477
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,840
'Can you have dinner with me tonight, Dorian?'

478
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,280
He shook his head.

479
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,560
'Tonight she is Ophelia,' he answered, 
'and tomorrow night she will be Juliet.'

480
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
'When is she Sibyl Vane?'

481
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,520
'Never.'

482
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
'That's good.'

483
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,360
'How horrible you are! But when you 
see her you will think differently.

484
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,240
I want you and Basil to come 
and watch her tomorrow night.

485
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,440
You are certain to recognize 
that she is wonderful.'

486
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,000
'All right.

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,800
Tomorrow evening.

488
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,960
Will you see Basil before 
then? Or shall I write to him?'

489
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,800
'Dear Basil! I haven't seen him for a week.

490
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,840
It is rather horrible of me as he 
sent me my portrait a few days ago.

491
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,040
I love looking at it.

492
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,280
Perhaps you should write to him.

493
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
I don't want to see him alone.

494
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,280
He says things that annoy me.

495
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
He gives me good advice.'

496
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Lord Henry smiled.

497
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,440
'People are very fond of giving 
away advice they need themselves.'

498
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,840
'Oh, Basil is a good man, but I don't think 
he really understands about art and beauty.

499
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,840
Since I have known you, Harry, 
I have discovered that.'

500
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,240
'Basil, my dear boy, puts everything 
that is charming in him into his work.'

501
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
'I must go now, Harry.

502
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
My Juliet is waiting for me.

503
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,840
Don't forget about tomorrow.

504
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,120
Goodbye.'

505
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,480
As Dorian left the room, Lord Henry began 
to think about what he had just learned.

506
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,840
Certainly few people had ever 
interested him so much as Dorian Gray.

507
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,040
Yet the mad worship of this actress 
did not make him annoyed or jealous.

508
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
He was pleased by it.

509
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
It made the boy more interesting to study.

510
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,440
Later that night, when he 
arrived home from dinner,  

511
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,920
Lord Henry saw a telegram 
on the table near the door.

512
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:09,840
He opened it and read that Dorian 
Gray was going to marry Sibyl Vane.

513
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,040
CHAPTER FOUR

514
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,680
The Worship of Sibyl Vane

515
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,840
'I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?' 
said Lord Henry the following evening.

516
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,800
They were in the dining-room of the Bristol Hotel.

517
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
'No, Harry,' answered the artist, 
giving his hat and coat to the waiter.

518
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,920
'What is it?'

519
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,240
'Dorian Gray is going to be married,' 
said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.

520
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
Hallward frowned.

521
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,920
'Dorian going to be married!' he cried.

522
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,360
'Impossible!'

523
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,520
'It is perfectly true.'

524
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,360
'To whom?'

525
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,360
'To some little actress.'

526
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
'But it would be absurd for him 
to marry someone like that.'

527
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,000
'If you want to make him marry 
this girl tell him that, Basil.

528
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,000
He is sure to do it, then.

529
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,840
Whenever a man does a completely stupid 
thing, it is always for a good reason.'

530
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
'I hope this girl is good, Harry.'

531
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,440
'Oh, she is better than good - she 
is beautiful,' said Lord Henry.

532
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,800
'Dorian says that she is beautiful and 
he is not often wrong about these things.

533
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,040
Your portrait has helped him 
understand beauty in others.

534
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,440
We are to see her tonight, 
if that boy doesn't forget.'

535
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,240
'But how can Dorian marry an actress, Harry?  

536
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,440
It is absurd,' cried the painter, walking 
up and down the room, biting his lip.

537
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,360
'Dorian Gray falls in love with a 
beautiful actress who plays Juliet.

538
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,160
He asks her to marry him.

539
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,720
Why not?

540
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,320
I hope that Dorian Gray marries this 
girl and worships her for six months.

541
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,880
Then he can suddenly become 
fascinated by another woman.'

542
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,080
'You don't mean a word of that,  

543
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,560
Harry! I know you don't really want 
Dorian Gray's life to be spoiled.

544
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
You are much better than you pretend to be.'

545
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,160
Lord Henry laughed.

546
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,960
'The reason we all like to think so well of 
others is because we are afraid for ourselves.

547
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,600
But here is Dorian himself.

548
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,920
He will tell you more than I can.'

549
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,080
'My dear Harry, my dear Basil, 
you must both congratulate me!'  

550
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,160
said the boy, throwing off his coat 
and shaking each of his friends' hands.

551
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,760
'I have never been so happy.

552
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,080
Of course it is sudden - all the best things are.

553
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,960
And yet it seems to me to be the one thing 
I have been looking for all my life.'

554
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,200
'I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,' 
said Hallward, 'but why did you not tell me?  

555
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,840
You told Harry.'

556
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,760
'There really is not much to tell,' cried Dorian.

557
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,160
'Last night I went to see her again.

558
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,080
After, when we were sitting together, 
there came into her eyes a wonderful look.

559
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
It was something I had never seen there before.

560
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,160
We kissed each other.

561
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,080
I can't describe to you 
what I felt at that moment.'

562
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,480
'Have you seen her today?' asked Lord Henry.

563
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
Dorian Gray shook his head.

564
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
'I have left her in Shakespeare's forest.

565
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,320
I will find her in his garden.'

566
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,840
'At what exact point did you 
use the word "marry", Dorian?  

567
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,640
And how did she answer? Perhaps 
you forgot all about it.'

568
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,280
'My dear Harry, it was not a business meeting.

569
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,360
I told her I loved her.

570
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,840
The whole world is nothing to me compared to her.'

571
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,280
'But my dear Dorian -'

572
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
Hallward put his hand on Lord Henry's arm.

573
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,840
'Don't Harry.

574
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,200
You have annoyed Dorian.

575
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
He is not like other men.

576
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
He would never harm anyone.'

577
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,120
Lord Henry looked across the table.

578
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,960
'Dorian is never annoyed with me,' he answered.

579
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,600
Dorian Gray laughed.

580
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,040
'When I am with Sibyl Vane I don't 
believe in anything you have taught me.

581
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,760
I forget all your fascinating, terrible ideas.'

582
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,640
'And those are...

583
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,080
?' asked Lord Henry, helping 
himself to some salad.

584
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,720
'Oh, your ideas about life, your ideas 
about love, your ideas about pleasure.

585
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
All your ideas, Harry.'

586
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,240
'Pleasure is the only thing worth having ideas 
about,' he answered, in his slow, musical voice.

587
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,920
'When we are happy we are always good, but 
when we are good we are not always happy.'

588
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,640
'I know what pleasure is,' cried Dorian Gray.

589
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,840
'It is to worship someone.'

590
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,840
'That is certainly better than 
when someone worships you.'

591
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,680
'Harry, you are terrible! I don't 
know why I like you so much.

592
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
Let us go down to the theatre.

593
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,920
When you see Sibyl you will change your ideas.'

594
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
They got up and put on their coats.

595
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
The painter was silent and thoughtful.

596
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,040
He felt very sad.

597
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,960
Dorian Gray would never again be to 
him all that he had been in the past.

598
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
Life had come between them.

599
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,840
When he arrived at the theatre it seemed 
to Hallward that he had grown years older.

600
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,320
CHAPTER FIVE

601
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,480
Dorian Leaves Sibyl

602
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
The theatre was crowded that night.

603
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,840
It was terribly hot and there were young people 
shouting to each other from across seats.

604
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,320
Women were laughing loudly and 
their voices sounded horrible.

605
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,080
People were eating oranges 
and drinking from bottles.

606
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,840
'What a place to find the perfect 
girl in!' said Lord Henry.

607
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
'Yes!' answered Dorian Gray.

608
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,040
'It was here I found her.

609
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,520
When you see her as Juliet 
you will forget everything.

610
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,840
These ugly people become quite 
different when she appears.'

611
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,760
'I understand what you mean, Dorian,' said 
the painter, 'and I believe in this girl.

612
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,880
Anyone you love must be wonderful.'

613
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,720
'Thanks, Basil,' answered Dorian Gray.

614
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,280
'I knew that you would understand me.

615
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,160
In a few minutes you will see the girl 
who I am going to give my life to.

616
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,760
The girl who I have given 
everything that is good in me.'

617
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,840
Then Sibyl appeared.

618
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
The crowd shouted and called her name.

619
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,160
Yes, she was certainly lovely 
to look at, Lord Henry thought.

620
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,440
Basil Hallward jumped to his feet excitedly.

621
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,560
Dorian Gray sat staring at 
her like he was in a dream.

622
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,520
'Charming! Charming!' cried Lord Henry.

623
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
A quarter of an hour later, Lord 
Henry whispered to Hallward.

624
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,600
'She's one of the loveliest 
girls I have ever seen.

625
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,960
But she is a terrible actress.'

626
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,760
Dorian Gray's face turned 
white as he watched her speak.

627
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,160
She was so different tonight! 
Now she was not Juliet  

628
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,400
but a very bad actress who did not 
understand Shakespeare's words.

629
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,320
Even the crowd became bored 
and began to talk loudly.

630
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,920
The only person who did not seem 
to notice was the actress herself.

631
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,360
Lord Henry got up from his 
chair and put on his coat.

632
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,880
'She is beautiful, Dorian,' 
he said, 'but she can't act.

633
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,080
Let's go.'

634
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,960
'I am going to stay until the end,' 
answered the boy in a cold voice.

635
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,920
'I am awfully sorry that I have 
made you waste an evening, Harry.

636
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,360
I apologize to you both.'

637
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,440
'My dear Dorian, perhaps Miss 
Vane is ill,' said Hallward.

638
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,880
'We will come some other night.'

639
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,600
'Come to the club with Basil and myself.

640
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,840
We will smoke cigarettes and 
drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.

641
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,600
She is beautiful.

642
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,600
What more do you want?'

643
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,520
'Go away, Harry,' cried the boy.

644
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
'I want to be alone.

645
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
Can't you see my heart is breaking?'  

646
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,240
Hot tears came to his eyes as Lord 
Henry and Hallward left the theatre.

647
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,400
When it was over, Dorian Gray 
rushed to see Sibyl Vane.

648
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,960
The girl was standing there alone, with a 
look of extraordinary happiness on her face.

649
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,080
'How badly I acted tonight, Dorian!' she cried.

650
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,840
'Horribly!' he answered, staring at her.

651
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,280
'It was terrible.

652
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,200
Are you ill? Why did you 
make me suffer like that?'

653
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,680
The girl smiled.

654
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,840
'Dorian, don't yon understand?'

655
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
'Understand what?' he asked, angrily.

656
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,840
'Why I was so bad tonight.

657
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
Why I will always be bad.

658
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,400
Why I will never act well again.'

659
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
'You are ill, I suppose.

660
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,760
When you are ill, you shouldn't act.

661
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,840
My friends were bored.

662
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
I was bored.'

663
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,320
'Dorian, Dorian,' she cried, 'before I knew you, 
acting was the one important thing in my life.

664
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
It was only in the theatre that I lived.

665
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,360
I thought that it was all true.

666
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,280
Tonight, for the first time in my 
life I saw that I was playing at love.

667
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,160
Our love for each other is the only true love.

668
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,000
Take me away with you, Dorian! I 
don't want to be an actress any more.'

669
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,000
He threw himself down on the 
sofa, and turned away his face.

670
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,080
'You have killed my love,' he said quietly.

671
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,560
Then he jumped up and went to the door.

672
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,960
'My God! How mad I was to love you! What a 
fool I have been! You are nothing to me now.

673
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,240
I will never see you again.

674
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
I will never think of you.

675
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,080
I will never speak to you again.'

676
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,120
The girl went white.

677
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:54,320
'You are not serious, Dorian? You are acting?' 
she whispered, putting her hand on his arm.

678
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,200
He pushed her back.

679
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,600
'Don't touch me!' he cried.

680
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,240
Then he turned and left the room.

681
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,560
After walking the streets of London all 
night, he arrived home just after sunrise.

682
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,880
As he passed through the library, he saw the 
portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him.

683
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,680
He stared at it in surprise 
and walked on into his bedroom.

684
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,520
He took his coat off and stood next to his bed.

685
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,800
A few moments later he returned to 
the picture and looked at it closely.

686
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,360
In the poor light the face 
seemed to have changed a little.

687
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,400
Now the mouth looked cruel.

688
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,360
It was certainly strange.

689
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,440
He walked to the window and opened the curtains.

690
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,920
The light changed the room, 
but the face stayed the same.

691
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,280
In fact, the sunlight made 
the mouth look even crueller.

692
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,240
Going back to his bedroom, he found a small 
mirror that had been a present from Lord Henry.

693
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,280
He looked at his real face 
and saw no sign of cruelty.

694
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,920
What did it mean?

695
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,120
He threw himself into a chair, and began to think.

696
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,040
Suddenly he remembered what he had said in  

697
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,160
Basil Hallward's house the day 
the picture had been finished.

698
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,920
Yes, he remembered it perfectly.

699
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,600
He had asked that the painting grow old 
so that he himself could remain young.

700
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
But such things were impossible.

701
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,680
It was terrible even to think about them.

702
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,560
And, yet, there was the picture in front of him.

703
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,440
There was the cruelty in the mouth.

704
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,840
Cruelty!

705
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,080
Had he been cruel?

706
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,840
No, why think about Sibyl Vane?

707
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,680
She was nothing to him now.

708
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,320
But the picture?

709
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,640
What was he to say of that?

710
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,040
It held the secret of his 
life, and told his story.

711
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,920
It had taught him to love his own beauty.

712
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,360
Would it teach him to hate his own soul?

713
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,840
Would he ever look at it again?

714
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,160
He would save himself!

715
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,920
He would not see Lord Henry again.

716
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,960
He would go back to Sibyl Vane, 
marry her and try to love her again.

717
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,840
She had suffered more than he had.

718
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,840
Poor child!

719
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
He had been selfish and cruel to her.

720
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,200
They would be happy together.

721
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,920
His life with her would be beautiful and pure.

722
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,400
He got up from his chair, 
and covered the portrait.

723
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,880
'How horrible!' he said to himself, and he 
walked across to the window and opened it.

724
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,600
When he stepped out on to the 
grass he took a deep breath.

725
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,080
He thought only of Sibyl.

726
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,040
The birds that were singing in the garden 
seemed to be telling the flowers about her.

727
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,800
CHAPTER SIX

728
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,680
Love Becomes Tragedy

729
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,640
It was nearly one o'clock the 
next afternoon when he woke up.

730
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,320
His servant brought him a 
cup of tea and some letters.

731
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,520
One of them was from Lord Henry, and 
had been brought by hand that morning.

732
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,760
He put it to one side.

733
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,040
He went into the library for 
breakfast feeling perfectly happy.

734
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,360
Then he saw the open window 
and the covered portrait.

735
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,840
Was it all true?

736
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Or had it just been a dream?

737
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,800
But he remembered that cruel mouth so clearly.

738
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,080
Dorian Gray sent his servant 
away and locked all the doors.

739
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,840
Then he pulled the cover off the 
painting, and saw himself face to face.

740
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,920
It was true.

741
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,240
The portrait had changed.

742
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,880
For hours he did not know what to do or think.

743
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,800
Finally, he went over to the table and wrote 
a passionate letter to the girl he had loved.

744
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,280
He asked her to forgive him for the 
terrible things he had said to her.

745
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,320
Suddenly he heard a knock on the door, 
and he heard Lord Henry's voice outside.

746
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,560
'My dear boy, I must see you.

747
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,400
Let me in at once.'

748
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,360
He made no answer, but remained quite still.

749
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,160
The knocking continued and grew louder.

750
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,640
Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in.

751
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,400
He would explain to him the 
new life he was going to lead.

752
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,360
He jumped up, covered the 
picture and opened the door.

753
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,440
'I am sorry about it all, Dorian,' 
said Lord Henry, as he entered.

754
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
'But you must not think too much about it.'

755
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,640
'Do you mean about Sibyl Vine?' asked the boy.

756
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,720
'Yes, of course,' answered Lord Henry, sitting 
down and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves.

757
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,400
'It is terrible, but you are not to blame.

758
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,040
Tell me, did you go behind and 
see her after it was over?'

759
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,920
'Yes.'

760
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,520
'I felt sure that you had.

761
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,840
Did you have an argument?'

762
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,320
'I was cruel, Harry - terribly cruel.

763
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
But it is all right now.

764
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,320
I am not sorry for anything that has happened.

765
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,480
It has taught me to know myself better.'

766
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,280
'Oh, Dorian, I am so glad 
that you see it that way.'

767
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,160
'I want to be good, Harry.

768
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,080
I don't want my soul to be ugly.

769
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,840
I am going to marry Sibyl Vine.'

770
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,920
'Marry Sibyl Vine!' cried Lord Henry, 
standing up, and staring at him in surprise.

771
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,360
'But, my dear Dorian -'

772
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,240
'Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say.

773
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Something horrible about getting married.

774
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,480
Don't say it! Sibyl will be my wife!'

775
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,160
'Your wife! Dorian!...

776
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,240
Didn't you get my letter? I 
wrote to you this morning.'

777
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,240
'Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember.

778
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,160
I have not read it yet, Harry.'

779
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,040
'You know nothing yet then?'

780
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,920
'What do you mean?'

781
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,480
Lord Henry walked across the room 
and sat down next to Dorian Gray.

782
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,800
Taking both his hands in his own, he held them.

783
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,640
'Dorian,' he said, 'my letter was to 
tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead.'

784
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,600
A cry of pain came from the boy's 
lips and he jumped to his feet.

785
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,280
'Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not 
true! It is a horrible lie!'

786
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,200
'It is true, Dorian,' said Lord Henry.

787
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,520
'It is in all the morning newspapers.

788
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,440
The police will be asking questions, and 
you must keep your name out of any scandal.

789
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,960
Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.

790
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,320
But in London they are a 
disaster for any gentleman.

791
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,080
I suppose they don't know your name at the 
theatre? If they don't, it is all right.

792
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,200
Did anyone see you going round to her room?'

793
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Dorian did not answer for a few moments.

794
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:37,360
Finally he said in a strange voice, 
'Harry, did you say that the police  

795
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:46,800
are asking questions? What did you mean by 
that? Did Sibyl -? Oh, Harry this is terrible!'

796
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,920
'I am sure that it was not an accident, though 
it must be described that way officially.

797
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,760
She swallowed something 
horrible they use at theatres.'

798
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,240
'Harry, Harry, it is terrible!' cried the boy.

799
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,160
'Yes, it is very sad, of course, 
but it is nothing to do with you.

800
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,080
Come with me to dinner, and 
after we will go to the theatre.'

801
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,960
'So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,' 
said Dorian Gray, half to himself.

802
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,640
'Yet the roses are not less lovely.

803
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,240
The birds still sing happily in my garden.

804
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,840
And tonight I will have dinner 
with you and go to the theatre.

805
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,880
How extraordinary life is!

806
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,840
My first passionate love 
letter was to a dead girl.

807
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:48,080
Yet why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as 
much as I want to? I don't think I am heartless.

808
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,440
Do you?'

809
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,680
'You have done too many foolish things in 
the last fortnight to be heartless, Dorian,'  

810
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,840
answered Lord Henry, with his sweet, sad smile.

811
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,600
The boy frowned.

812
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,440
'I don't like that explanation, Harry,' he said, 
'but I am glad you don't think I am heartless.'

813
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,320
'A woman has killed herself for 
the love of you,' said Lord Henry.

814
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,320
'That is very beautiful.'

815
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,240
They were silent.

816
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
The evening darkened in the room.

817
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
After some time Dorian Gray looked up.

818
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,800
'How well you know me! But we will 
not talk again of what has happened.

819
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,080
It has been something wonderful.

820
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,720
That is all.

821
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,480
Now, I have to dress, Harry.

822
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:56,000
I feel too tired to eat anything, but 
I will join you later at the theatre.'

823
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,520
As Lord Henry closed the door behind him Dorian 
rushed to the portrait and tore off the cover.

824
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,160
No, there was no further change in the picture.

825
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,320
It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's 
death before he had known of it himself.

826
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,560
Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her.

827
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,400
He brushed them away and 
looked again at the picture.

828
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,640
He felt the time had come to choose.

829
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,760
Or had he already chosen?

830
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,480
Yes, life had decided that for him.

831
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,840
The portrait was going to 
carry his shame: that was all.

832
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,720
An hour later he was at the theatre, 
and Lord Henry was sitting beside him.

833
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,240
CHAPTER SEVEN

834
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,600
'What Is Past Is Past?'

835
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,600
As he was eating breakfast the next morning, 
Basil Hallward was shown into the room.

836
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,400
I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,' he said.

837
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,400
'I called last night, and they told 
me that you were at the theatre.

838
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,120
Of course I knew that was impossible.

839
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,240
I had a terrible evening worrying whether 
one tragedy would be followed by another.

840
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,480
I can't tell you how heart-broken 
I am about the whole thing.

841
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,760
Did you go and see the girl's mother? 
What did she say about it all?'

842
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,240
'My dear Basil, I don't know,' said Dorian Gray.

843
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,440
He looked very bored.

844
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,000
'I was at the theatre.'

845
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,280
'You went to the theatre?' said 
Hallward, speaking very slowly.

846
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,320
'You went to the theatre where 
Sibyl Vane was lying dead?'

847
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,240
'Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!' 
cried Dorian, jumping to his feet.

848
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,280
'You must not speak of such things.

849
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,480
What is done is done.

850
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,800
What is past is past.'

851
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:11,760
'You call yesterday the past? Dorian, this is 
horrible! Something has changed you completely.

852
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,560
You look exactly the same as the wonderful boy 
in my picture, but now there is no heart in you.

853
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,000
It is all Harry's influence.

854
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,800
I see that.'

855
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,840
The boy went to the window and looked 
out at the garden for a few moments.

856
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,280
'Harry has taught me many things, Basil.'

857
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,160
he said at last.

858
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,840
'You have only taught me to love my own beauty.'

859
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,600
'I am truly sorry for that, Dorian.'

860
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,720
I don't know what you mean, 
Basil,' he said, turning round.

861
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,600
'I don't know what you want.

862
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,680
What do you want?'

863
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,560
'I want the Dorian Gray I used 
to paint,' said the artist sadly.

864
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,240
'Basil,' said the boy, going over to him 
and putting his hand on his shoulder,  

865
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,720
'you have come too late.

866
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,240
Yesterday when I heard that 
Sibyl Vane had killed herself-'

867
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,200
'Killed herself! My God! Is there no 
doubt about that?' cried Hallward.

868
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,560
'My dear Basil! Of course she killed herself.'

869
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,840
The older man put his face in his hands.

870
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,680
'How terrible,' he said in a quiet voice.

871
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,120
'No,' said Dorian Gray, 'there 
is nothing terrible about it.

872
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,840
It is one of the great 
romantic tragedies of our time.

873
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,560
I know you are surprised at 
me talking to you like this.

874
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,000
You have not realized how I have changed.

875
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,800
I was a boy when you knew me.

876
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,560
I am a man now.

877
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,000
I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas -'

878
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,520
'But Dorian -'

879
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,200
'I am different, but you must not like me less.

880
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,720
Of course I am very fond of Harry.

881
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,640
But I know that you are better than he is.

882
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,240
You are not stronger - you are too 
afraid of life - but you are better.

883
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:19,120
And how happy we used to be together! Don't 
leave me, Basil, and don't argue with me.

884
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,840
I am what I am.'

885
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,080
The painter felt strangely sad.

886
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,840
Dorian Gray was extraordinarily important to him.

887
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,400
The boy had changed his art.

888
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
Perhaps his cruel talk about Sibyl Vane 
was just a mood that would pass away.

889
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,360
There was so much in him that was good.

890
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,840
'Well, Dorian,' he said with a sad smile, 'I won't 
speak to you again about this horrible thing.

891
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,920
I only hope that your name 
is kept out of any scandal.

892
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,960
Have the police asked to see you?'

893
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,240
Dorian shook his head.

894
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,840
'They don't even know my name,' he answered.

895
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,640
'She didn't know your name?'

896
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,920
'Only my first name, and I am sure 
that she did not tell it to anyone.

897
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,880
She told her family that I was Prince Charming.

898
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,840
It was pretty of her.

899
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,480
You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil.

900
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,400
I would like to have something more of 
her than the memory of a few kisses.'

901
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,400
'I will try and do something, Dorian.

902
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,920
But you must come and sit for me again.

903
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,760
I can't work so well without you.'

904
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,360
'I can never sit for you again, Basil.

905
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,760
It is impossible!' he cried.

906
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,560
'My dear boy, what is this 
foolishness!' Hallward cried.

907
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:52,160
'Did you not like what I did for you? Where is 
it? Why have you covered it? Let me look at it.

908
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,440
It is the best thing I have ever done.

909
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,720
It is very bad of your servant 
to hide my work like that.

910
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,000
I felt the room looked different as I came in.'

911
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,560
'It was not my servant who covered it, Basil.

912
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,600
I did it myself.

913
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
The light was too strong on the portrait.'

914
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,560
'Too strong! No, the light is perfect in here.

915
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,080
Let me see it.'

916
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,120
And Hallward walked towards 
the corner of the room.

917
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,920
A terrible cry came from Dorian Gray's lips,  

918
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,720
and he rushed between the 
painter and the covered portrait.

919
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,640
'Basil, you must not look 
at it! I don't want you to.'

920
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:38,480
'Not look at my own work! Are you serious? Why 
shouldn't I look at it?' cried Hallward, laughing.

921
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,840
'If you try and look at it, Basil, I 
promise I will never speak to you again.

922
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,920
I am very serious.'

923
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,640
Hallward looked at Dorian Gray in surprise.

924
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,040
He had never seen him like this before.

925
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,840
The boy's face was white and angry.

926
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,680
'Dorian!'

927
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,200
'Don't speak!'

928
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,680
'But what is the matter? Of course I 
won't look at it if you don't want me to,'  

929
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,920
he said coldly, walking over to the window.

930
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,160
'But it seems rather absurd 
that I cannot see my own work  

931
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,520
when I am going to exhibit 
it in Paris in the autumn.'

932
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,040
'To exhibit it? You want to 
exhibit it?' cried Dorian Gray.

933
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,080
A terrible fear was building inside him.

934
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,280
Was the world going to see his secret?

935
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,640
Were people going to stare 
at the mystery of his life?

936
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,720
That was impossible.

937
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,560
'Yes, George Petit is going to exhibit 
all my best pictures in October.

938
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,360
Don't worry, it is only for one month.'

939
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,760
Dorian Gray passed his hand across his face.

940
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,080
It felt hot and wet.

941
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,840
He felt that he was about to face horrible danger.

942
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,280
'You told me a month ago that you 
would never exhibit it,' he cried.

943
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:06,160
'Why have you changed your mind?' He stopped 
suddenly and a cruel look came into his eyes.

944
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:13,040
He had remembered something Lord Henry had said to 
him, 'Ask Basil why he won't exhibit your picture.

945
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,200
He told me once and it is a very strange story.'

946
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,240
Yes, perhaps Basil too had his secret.

947
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,960
He would ask him and try.

948
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,680
'Basil,' he said, coming over quite close, 
and looking him straight in the face.

949
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,320
'We all have secrets.

950
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,400
What was your reason for not 
wanting to exhibit my picture?'

951
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,840
'Dorian, if I told you, you might 
like me less than you do now.

952
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,160
And you would certainly laugh at me.

953
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,160
If you don't want me ever to look 
at your picture again, I won't.

954
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,960
I have always you to look at.

955
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,960
Your friendship is more important 
to me than exhibiting a painting.'

956
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,640
'No, Basil, you must tell me,' said Dorian Gray.

957
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,600
His feeling of fear had passed away.

958
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,760
Now he just wanted to find 
out Basil Hallward's mystery.

959
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,400
'Dorian,' said the painter, 
who did not look happy.

960
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,760
'Have you ever noticed something 
in the picture, something strange?'

961
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,040
'Basil!' cried the boy, 
staring at him with wild eyes.

962
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,680
'I see you did.

963
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,880
Dorian, from the moment I met you,  

964
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,160
your personality had the most 
extraordinary influence over me.

965
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,840
I worshipped you.

966
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,720
I was jealous of everyone you spoke to.

967
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,440
I wanted to have you all to myself.

968
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,480
I was only happy when I was with you.

969
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,480
When you were away from me you 
were still there in my art.'

970
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,800
'Basil -'

971
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,760
'No, don't speak.

972
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,000
I must tell you now what I did not tell you then.

973
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,000
That I decided to paint a 
wonderful portrait of you.

974
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,680
I put all my feelings for you into that picture.

975
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,080
I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much.

976
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,320
I had put too much of myself into it.

977
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,680
So I decided never to exhibit the portrait.

978
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,560
I told Harry and he laughed.

979
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,240
When the picture was finished, and I sat 
alone with it, I felt that I was right...

980
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,480
Later, I thought that perhaps I was being 
foolish and when this Paris offer came...

981
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,600
but I see now that the picture cannot be shown.'

982
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,800
Dorian Gray breathed deeply.

983
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,680
The colour came back to his cheeks 
and a smile crossed his lips.

984
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,320
The danger was over and he was safe for a while.

985
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,840
What a sad story Basil had told.

986
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,200
Would he ever be so influenced 
by the personality of a friend?

987
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,520
Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.

988
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,360
But that was all.

989
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,200
'It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,' said 
Hallward, 'that you saw this in the portrait.'

990
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:21,840
T saw something in it,' he answered, 
'something that seemed to me very strange.'

991
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,680
'Well, you don't mind me 
looking at the thing now?'

992
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,160
Dorian shook his head.

993
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,360
'You must not ask me that, Basil.

994
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,080
I cannot let you stand in front of that picture.'

995
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,440
'You will one day, won't you?'

996
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:38,880
'Never.'

997
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,200
'Well, perhaps you are right.

998
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,240
And now goodbye, Dorian.

999
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,880
You have been the one person in my 
life who has really influenced my art.

1000
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,360
But you don't know what it cost me to 
tell you all that I have told you.'

1001
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:04,320
'My dear Basil,' said Dorian, 'what have you 
told me? Only that you worshipped me too much.

1002
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,640
That is not even flattery.'

1003
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,080
'It was not meant as flattery.

1004
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,960
And now that I have told you, 
something seems to have gone out of me.

1005
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,040
Perhaps you should never put 
what you worship into words.'

1006
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,880
'You mustn't talk about worship.

1007
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,760
It is foolish.

1008
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,400
You and I are friends, Basil, 
and we will always be friends.'

1009
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,680
'You have got Harry.'

1010
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,960
said the painter, sadly.

1011
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,480
'Oh, Harry!' laughed the young man.

1012
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,800
'Harry spends his life saying 
and doing extraordinary things.

1013
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,760
He lives the sort of life I want to live.

1014
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,440
But I don't think I would go 
to Harry if I was in trouble.

1015
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,080
I would prefer to go to you, Basil.'

1016
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,520
'You will sit for me again?'

1017
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,920
'Impossible! There is something 
terrible about a portrait.

1018
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,840
It has a life of its own.

1019
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,960
I will come and have tea with you instead.'

1020
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,960
'Well, goodbye then.

1021
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,240
I am sorry that you won't let 
me look at the picture again.

1022
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,840
But I understand what you feel about it.'

1023
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,280
As he left the room, Dorian 
Gray smiled to himself.

1024
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,360
Poor Basil!

1025
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,560
How little he knew of the true reason.

1026
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,360
And now he understood more the painter's 
wild and jealous feelings, and he felt sorry.

1027
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,600
There was something tragic in a 
friendship so corrupted by passion.

1028
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,680
He rang the bell to call his servant.

1029
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,840
He had to hide the portrait immediately.

1030
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,840
It had been mad of him to leave it in a place 
where it could be discovered by his friends.

1031
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,560
CHAPTER EIGHT

1032
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,560
The Portrait Is Hidden

1033
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,280
When the servant entered, Dorian Gray asked 
him to send Mrs Leaf to him in the library.

1034
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,720
Mrs Leaf had been with his family for many years.

1035
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,000
He asked her for the key to the old schoolroom.

1036
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,560
'The old schoolroom, Mr Dorian?' she cried.

1037
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,520
'But it is full of dust! I must clean it first.'

1038
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,880
'I don't want it cleaned, Mrs Leaf.

1039
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,240
I only want the key.'

1040
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,400
'Well, sir, you'll be covered 
with dust if you go into it.

1041
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,680
It hasn't been open for nearly five 
years, not since your grandfather died.'

1042
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,360
He frowned at this reminder of his grandfather.

1043
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,000
He had bad memories of all his family.

1044
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,520
'That does not matter,' he answered.

1045
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,080
'I just want to see the place - that is all.

1046
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,960
Give me the key.'

1047
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,880
'Here is the key, sir,' said the old lady.

1048
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,920
'But you are not going to 
live up there, are you, sir?'

1049
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,400
'No, no,' he cried.

1050
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,720
'Thank you, Mrs Leaf.

1051
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,360
You can go.'

1052
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,240
An hour later two men 
arrived to move the portrait.

1053
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,840
'It's very heavy, sir,' said one of 
the men, as they climbed the stairs.

1054
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,360
'I am afraid it is rather heavy,' 
said Dorian, as he opened the door  

1055
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,520
of the old schoolroom where he was going 
to hide the secret of his corrupted soul.

1056
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,360
He had not entered the room since he was a child.

1057
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,000
It was a large room built by his 
grandfather to keep him at a distance.

1058
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,040
Every moment of his lonely childhood 
came back to him as he looked round.

1059
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,320
It was a room full of terrible 
memories, but it was safe.

1060
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,240
He had the key, and no 
other person could enter it.

1061
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,840
The face in the portrait could grow old and ugly.

1062
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,720
What did it matter?

1063
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,320
No one could see it.

1064
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,400
He himself would not see it.

1065
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,400
He did not have to watch the 
terrible corruption of his soul.

1066
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,080
He would stay young - that was enough.

1067
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,800
When the men had gone, Dorian locked 
the door, and put the key in his pocket.

1068
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,640
He felt safe now.

1069
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,760
No one would ever look at that horrible thing.

1070
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,720
Only he would ever see his shame.

1071
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,160
He went back to the library and 
found a note from Lord Henry.

1072
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,160
In it was a report from the 
newspaper about Sibyl Vane.

1073
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,400
Her death was officially described as an accident.

1074
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,240
He frowned, and tore the paper in two.

1075
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,920
Then he walked across the room 
and threw the pieces away.

1076
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,480
How ugly it all was!

1077
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,000
And how horribly real ugliness made things!

1078
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,920
Perhaps the servant had read the report, 
and had begun to suspect something.

1079
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,200
And, yet, what did it matter? What had 
Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death?  

1080
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,360
There was nothing to be afraid of.

1081
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,720
Dorian Gray had not killed her.

1082
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,440
CHAPTER NINE

1083
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,920
'I Will Show You my Soul'

1084
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,200
Many years passed.

1085
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,440
Yet the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated 
Basil Hallward, stayed with Dorian Gray.

1086
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,200
Even those who had heard terrible rumours against 
him, could not believe them when they met him.

1087
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,280
He always had the look of someone 
who had kept himself pure.

1088
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,120
Many people suspected that there was 
something very wrong with Dorian's life,  

1089
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,080
but only he knew about the portrait.

1090
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,760
Some nights he would secretly 
enter the locked room.

1091
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,680
Holding a mirror in his hand, he would stand in 
front of the picture Basil Hallward had painted.

1092
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,840
He would look first at the 
horrible, old face in the picture,  

1093
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,640
and then at the handsome young face that 
laughed back at him from the mirror.

1094
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,040
He fell more and more in love with his own beauty.

1095
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,840
And more and more interested in 
the corruption of his own soul.

1096
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,520
Then something happened that changed everything.

1097
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,880
It was on the ninth of November, the 
day before his thirty-eighth birthday.

1098
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,840
He was walking home from Lord Henry's 
and the night was cold and foggy.

1099
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,360
At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South 
Audley Street, a man passed him in the fog.

1100
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,840
He was walking very fast, and had 
the collar of his coat turned up.

1101
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,920
He had a bag in his hand.

1102
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,240
Dorian recognized him.

1103
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,160
It was Basil Hallward.

1104
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,680
A strange fear made Dorian walk off 
quickly in the direction of his own house.

1105
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,560
But Hallward had seen him.

1106
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,040
Dorian heard him hurrying after him.

1107
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,000
In a few moments his hand was on his arm.

1108
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,960
'Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck!  

1109
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,000
I have been waiting for you in your 
library ever since nine o'clock.

1110
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,960
I am going to Paris on the midnight train, 
and I wanted to see you before I left.

1111
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,760
I thought it was you, or at 
least your coat, as I passed you.

1112
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,720
But I wasn't sure.

1113
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,040
Didn't you recognize me?'

1114
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,800
'In this fog, my dear Basil? I can't 
even recognize Grosvenor Square.

1115
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,680
I believe my house is somewhere about here, 
but I don't feel at all certain about it.

1116
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,320
I am sorry you are going away, as I 
have not seen you for such a long time.

1117
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,160
But I suppose you will be back soon?'

1118
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,600
'No, I am going to be out 
of England for six months.

1119
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,000
Here we are at your door.

1120
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,400
Let me come in for a moment.

1121
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,920
I have something to say to you.'

1122
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,480
'That would be lovely.

1123
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,840
But won't you miss your train?' said Dorian Gray,  

1124
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,560
as he went up the steps and 
opened the door with his key.

1125
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,160
'I have plenty of time,' he answered.

1126
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,320
'The train doesn't go until 
twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.

1127
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,680
All I have with me is this bag, and I can easily 
get to Victoria Station in twenty minutes.'

1128
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,040
Dorian looked at him and smiled.

1129
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,880
'Come in or the fog will get into my house.'

1130
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,200
Hallward followed Dorian into the library.

1131
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,440
There was a bright wood fire on one side 
of the room and two lamps on the other.

1132
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,360
'Would you like a drink?'asked Dorian.

1133
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,280
'No thanks, I won't have anything more,' said 
the painter, taking his hat and coat off.

1134
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,720
'And now, my dear Dorian, I 
want to speak to you seriously.

1135
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,920
Don't frown like that.

1136
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
You make it so much more difficult for me.''

1137
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,480
'What is it all about?' cried Dorian, 
throwing himself down on the sofa.

1138
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,960
'I hope it is not about myself.

1139
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,280
I am tired of myself tonight.

1140
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,200
I would prefer to be somebody different.'

1141
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,560
'It is about yourself,' answered Hallward, in 
his deep voice, 'and I must say it to you.'

1142
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,400
Dorian breathed deeply and lit a cigarette.

1143
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,000
'Is it really necessary, Basil?'

1144
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,880
'I think you should know some of the terrible 
things that people are saying about you.'

1145
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,880
'I don't want to know anything about them.

1146
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,600
I love scandals about other people, but 
scandals about myself don't interest me.'

1147
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,320
'Every gentleman is interested 
in his good name, Dorian.

1148
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,160
You don't want people to talk of you 
as something terrible and corrupt.

1149
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,200
But I don't believe these rumours at all.

1150
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,600
At least I can't believe them when I see you.

1151
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,600
Corruption is a thing that writes 
itself across a man's face.

1152
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,560
It cannot be hidden.'

1153
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,760
'My dear Basil -'

1154
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,160
'And yet, I rarely see you now 
and you never come to my house.

1155
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,640
When I hear all the terrible things people are 
whispering about you, I don't know what to say.

1156
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,720
Why have so many of your friends killed 
themselves? Young men from good families  

1157
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,080
like Adrian Singleton and 
that poor young soldier?'

1158
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,000
'Stop, Basil.

1159
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,160
You are talking about things of 
which you know nothing,' said Dorian.

1160
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,720
'I know how people talk in England.

1161
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,120
This is a country where people have two faces.

1162
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,920
They whisper rumours about people like myself,  

1163
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,320
and then do much worse things 
when others are not looking.'

1164
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,840
'Dorian,' cried Hallward, 
'that is not the question.

1165
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:15,600
I know England is bad, but that's the reason I 
want you to be a good influence on your friends.

1166
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,840
Instead you have lost all 
belief in goodness and honesty.

1167
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,920
You have filled those poor young 
men with a madness for pleasure.'

1168
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,320
Dorian smiled.

1169
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:32,160
'How can you smile like that? I 
only want you to have a clean name.

1170
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,720
You have a wonderful influence.

1171
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,920
Let it be for good.

1172
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,440
Yet I wonder whether I know you? 
But I can't answer that question.

1173
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,760
I would need to see your soul.'

1174
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,720
'To see my soul!' cried Dorian Gray.

1175
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,920
He jumped up from the sofa, 
turning almost white with fear.

1176
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,360
'Yes,' answered Hallward.

1177
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,920
There was a deep sadness in his voice.

1178
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,920
'To see your soul.

1179
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,560
But only God can do that.'

1180
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,960
A bitter laugh came from 
the lips of the younger man.

1181
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,880
'You will see it yourself, tonight!' he 
cried, picking up a lamp from the table.

1182
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,240
'Come, it is your own work.

1183
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,960
Why shouldn't you look at it? You can tell 
the world all about it after, if you want.

1184
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,640
Nobody will believe you.

1185
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,000
If they do believe you, they 
will like me better for it.

1186
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,760
Come, I tell you.

1187
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,160
You have talked enough about corruption.

1188
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,640
Now you will see it face to face.'

1189
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,160
There was madness in every word he said.

1190
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,320
He felt a terrible delight that 
someone was going to share his secret.

1191
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,400
The man who had painted the portrait 
was going to share his shame.

1192
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,120
The painter would suffer for the rest of his 
life with the memory of what he had done.

1193
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,320
'Yes,' he continued, coming closer to him.

1194
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,920
'I will show you my soul.

1195
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,120
You will see what you think only God can see.'

1196
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,760
Hallward jumped back.

1197
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,680
'You cannot say things like 
that, Dorian!' he cried.

1198
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,840
'They are horrible and they don't mean anything.'

1199
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,680
'You think so?' He laughed again.

1200
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,720
'I know so.

1201
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,960
Dorian, you have to tell me -'

1202
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,080
'Don't touch me.

1203
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,160
Finish what you have to say.'

1204
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,400
The painter felt extraordinarily sad.

1205
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,320
He walked over to the fire and stood there.

1206
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,960
'I am waiting, Basil,' said the 
young man, in a hard, clear voice.

1207
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:33,920
He turned round.

1208
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,720
'What I have to say is this,' he cried.

1209
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,880
'You must give me some answer to the horrible 
things people are saying against you.

1210
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,160
Tell me that they are not true, Dorian! 
Can't you see what I am going through?  

1211
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,320
My God! Don't tell me that you 
are bad and corrupt and shameful.'

1212
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,440
Dorian Gray smiled.

1213
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,000
'Come upstairs, Basil,' he said, quietly.

1214
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,440
'I keep a diary of my life from day to day.

1215
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,160
I will show it to you if you come up with me.'

1216
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,240
'I will come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.

1217
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,200
I see I have missed my train.

1218
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,000
It does not matter.

1219
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,960
I can go tomorrow.

1220
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,920
But don't ask me to read anything tonight.

1221
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,280
All I want is a simple answer to my question.'

1222
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,040
'I will give it to you upstairs.

1223
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,200
I could not give it to you here.

1224
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:35,840
You will not have to read for long.'

1225
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,520
CHAPTER TEN

1226
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,840
Basil Sees the Portrait

1227
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,960
He passed out of the room and 
began climbing the stairs.

1228
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,160
Basil Hallward followed close behind.

1229
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,840
They walked softly, as people always do at night.

1230
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,600
The lamp made strange shadows 
on the wall and stairs.

1231
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,480
When they reached the top, Dorian 
put the lamp down on the floor.

1232
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,960
He took the key out of his 
pocket and turned it in the lock.

1233
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,640
'You really want to know, 
Basil?' he asked in a low voice.

1234
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,480
'Yes.'

1235
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,960
'I am delighted,' he answered, smiling.

1236
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:18,400
Then he added, 'You are the one man in the 
world I want to know everything about me.

1237
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,680
You have influenced my life more than you think.'

1238
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,440
Taking up the lamp, he 
opened the door and went in.

1239
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,160
Cold air passed between them.

1240
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,000
'Shut the door behind you,' he whispered, 
as he placed the lamp on the table.

1241
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,680
Hallward looked around the room in surprise.

1242
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,120
The room had clearly not been lived in for years.

1243
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,760
The whole place was covered with dust, 
and there were holes in the carpet.

1244
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,360
A mouse ran across the floor.

1245
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,080
'So you think that it is only 
God who sees the soul, Basil.

1246
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,840
Take the cover off the portrait, 
and you will see mine.'

1247
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,360
The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.

1248
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,840
'You are mad, Dorian,' said Hallward, frowning.

1249
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,960
'You won't take the cover off? Then I 
will do it myself,' said the young man,  

1250
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,120
throwing the old purple curtain to the ground.

1251
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,680
A cry of fear came from the painter's 
lips when he saw the face in the portrait.

1252
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:27,040
It was Dorian Gray's face he was looking at, 
and it still had some of that wonderful beauty.

1253
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,240
But now there were terrible 
signs of age and corruption.

1254
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,000
But who had done it?

1255
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,400
He held the lamp up to the picture.

1256
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,160
In the left hand corner was 
his name, painted in red.

1257
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:40,960
What had happened?

1258
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,840
He had never done that.

1259
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,560
Still, it was his own picture.

1260
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,840
He knew it, and it made his blood turn to ice.

1261
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,000
His own picture!

1262
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,520
What did it mean?

1263
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,200
Why had it changed?

1264
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,560
He turned, and looked at Dorian 
Gray with the eyes of a sick man.

1265
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,440
The young man was standing 
near the wall, watching him.

1266
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,880
He had taken the flower out of 
his coat, and was smelling it.

1267
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,880
'What does this mean?' cried Hallward, at last.

1268
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,920
His own voice sounded high and strange.

1269
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,520
'Years ago, when I was a boy,' said Dorian Gray,  

1270
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,320
closing his hand on the flower, 
'you met me and flattered me.

1271
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,080
You taught me to love my beauty.

1272
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,200
One day you introduced me to a friend of yours.

1273
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,920
He explained to me how 
wonderful it was to be young.

1274
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,840
You finished a portrait of me that showed 
me how wonderful it was to be beautiful.

1275
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,800
In a mad moment I made a wish -'

1276
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,360
'I remember it! Oh, how well I remember 
it! No! The thing is impossible.

1277
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,440
There must be something wrong with the paint.

1278
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,840
I tell you the thing is impossible.'

1279
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,000
'Is anything really impossible?' said 
the young man, going over to the window.

1280
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,440
'You told me you had destroyed it.'

1281
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,360
'I was wrong.

1282
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,840
It has destroyed me.'

1283
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,520
'I don't believe it is my picture.

1284
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,760
There was nothing bad in it, nothing shameful.

1285
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,840
You were perfect to me.

1286
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,160
This is a face from hell.'

1287
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,840
'It is the face of my soul.

1288
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,240
Each of us has Heaven and Hell in 
him, Basil,' cried Dorian wildly.

1289
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,240
Hallward turned again to the 
portrait, and stared at it.

1290
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,920
'My God! Is this true?' he cried.

1291
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,680
'Is this what you have done with your life? 
You must be even worse than people say!'

1292
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,760
Hallward threw himself into the chair by 
the table and put his face in his hands.

1293
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,240
The lamp fell to the floor and went out.

1294
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,520
'Good God, Dorian! What an awful 
lesson! What an awful lesson!'  

1295
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,440
There was no answer, but he could hear 
the young man crying at the window.

1296
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,880
'We must ask God for forgiveness.

1297
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,280
I worshipped you too much.

1298
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,280
I am punished for it.

1299
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,680
You worshipped yourself too much.

1300
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,240
We are both punished.'

1301
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,200
Dorian Gray turned slowly 
around and looked at him.

1302
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,680
There were tears in his eyes.

1303
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,160
'It is too late, Basil,' he said.

1304
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,840
'But don't you see that 
hellish thing staring at us?'

1305
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,640
Dorian Gray looked at the picture.

1306
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,880
Suddenly he felt that he hated Basil Hallward.

1307
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,840
He hated the man sitting at the table 
more than he hated anything in his life.

1308
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,480
He looked wildly around.

1309
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,840
Something shone on top of the 
painted cupboard that faced him.

1310
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,720
It was a knife he had left there some days before.

1311
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,280
He moved slowly towards it, 
passing Hallward as he did so.

1312
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,400
He took the knife in his hand and turned around.

1313
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,560
Hallward moved in his chair.

1314
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,040
He rushed at him, and stuck the 
knife into his neck again and again.

1315
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,000
He threw the knife down on 
the table and stood back.

1316
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,400
He could hear nothing but the sound 
of blood falling on to the carpet.

1317
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,520
He opened the door and went out on to the stairs.

1318
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,640
The house was completely quiet.

1319
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,560
No one was there.

1320
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,040
How quickly it had all been done!

1321
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,760
Feeling strangely calm, he walked 
over to the window and opened it.

1322
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,160
The wind had blown the fog 
away and the sky was clear.

1323
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,640
He looked down and saw a 
policeman walking down the street.

1324
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,120
He was shining a lamp in all the houses.

1325
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,880
Closing the window, he went back into the room.

1326
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,040
He did not look at the murdered man.

1327
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,360
He felt that the secret of the whole 
thing was not to think about it at all.

1328
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,240
The friend who had painted the terrible 
portrait had gone out of his life.

1329
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,120
That was enough.

1330
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,560
He picked up the lamp and walked out of 
the room, locking the door behind him.

1331
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,840
As he walked down the stairs he thought that 
he heard what sounded like cries of pain.

1332
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,960
He stopped several times, and waited.

1333
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,880
No, everything was still.

1334
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,720
When he reached the library, he 
saw the bag and coat in the corner.

1335
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,440
They must be hidden away somewhere.

1336
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,240
He unlocked a secret cupboard and threw them in.

1337
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,320
He could easily burn them later.

1338
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,320
Then he pulled out his watch.

1339
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,880
It was twenty minutes to two.

1340
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,080
He sat down and began to think.

1341
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,360
Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven.

1342
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,600
No one had seen him come in again.

1343
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,840
The servants were in bed… Paris!

1344
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,440
Yes.

1345
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,840
It was to Paris that Basil had gone.

1346
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,240
And by the midnight train as he had planned.

1347
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,440
It would be months before 
anyone suspected anything.

1348
01:26:59,440 --> 01:26:59,920
Months!

1349
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,840
He could destroy everything long before then.

1350
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,080
Suddenly he had a thought.

1351
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,400
He put on his coat and hat 
and went into the front room.

1352
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,000
From the window he could see 
the policeman passing the house.

1353
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,840
He waited, and held his breath.

1354
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,040
After a few moments he went out of the house, 
shutting the door very gently behind him.

1355
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,440
Then he began ringing the bell.

1356
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,560
In about five minutes a servant appeared.

1357
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,840
He was half dressed and looked very sleepy.

1358
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,120
'I am sorry I had to wake you up, 
Francis,' he said, stepping in.

1359
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,280
'But I have forgotten my key.

1360
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,040
What time is it?'

1361
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,320
'Ten minutes past two, sir,' 
answered the man, looking at a clock.

1362
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:52,800
'Ten minutes past two? How horribly 
late! You must wake me at nine tomorrow.

1363
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,760
I have some work to do.'

1364
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,760
'All right, sir.'

1365
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,720
'Did anyone call this evening?'

1366
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,280
'Mr Hallward, sir.

1367
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,560
He stayed here until eleven, and then 
he went away to catch his train.'

1368
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,840
'Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him.

1369
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,440
Did he leave any message?'

1370
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,520
'No, sir.

1371
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,840
He said he would write to you from Paris.'

1372
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,680
'That is all, Francis.

1373
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,080
Don't forget to call me at nine tomorrow.'

1374
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:19,920
'No, sir.'

1375
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,720
The man went off to his bedroom.

1376
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,120
Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon 
the table and passed into the library.

1377
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,920
For a quarter of an hour he walked up and 
down the room, biting his lip and thinking.

1378
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,400
Then he took down a book from one of the 
cupboards, and began to turn the pages.

1379
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,120
'Alan Campbell, 152 Hertford Street, Mayfair.'

1380
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,280
Yes, that was the man he wanted.

1381
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,840
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1382
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,280
The Problem of the Body

1383
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,120
At nine o'clock the next morning his 
servant came in with a cup of chocolate,  

1384
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,160
and opened the curtains.

1385
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:07,680
Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, 
lying with one hand under his cheek.

1386
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,240
As he opened his eyes a 
smile passed across his lips.

1387
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,240
He turned round, and began to drink his chocolate.

1388
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,080
The November sun came into the 
room, and the sky was bright.

1389
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,760
It was almost like a morning in May.

1390
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,920
Slowly he remembered what had 
happened the night before.

1391
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,480
The dead man was still sitting 
there, and in the sunlight now.

1392
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,960
How horrible that was!

1393
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,840
Such terrible things were for 
the darkness, not the day.

1394
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,120
After he had drunk his cup of chocolate, he 
went over to the table and wrote two letters.

1395
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,600
One he put in his pocket, and the 
other he handed to his servant.

1396
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,640
'Take this round to 152 Hertford Street, Francis.

1397
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,840
If Mr Campbell is out of town, get his address.'

1398
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,320
When the servant had gone, he lit a cigarette, 
and began drawing on a piece of paper.

1399
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,240
First he drew flowers, then 
houses, then human faces.

1400
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,640
Suddenly he realized that every face 
he drew looked like Basil Hallward.

1401
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,000
He frowned and went over to lie on the sofa.

1402
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,600
An hour went past very slowly.

1403
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,320
Every second he kept looking up at the clock.

1404
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,680
As the minutes went by he became horribly worried.

1405
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,080
He got up and walked around the room.

1406
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,560
His hands were strangely cold.

1407
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:33,920
At last the door opened, and his servant entered.

1408
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,920
'Mr Campbell, sir,' said the man.

1409
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,480
The colour came back to his cheeks.

1410
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,760
'Ask him to come in at once, Francis.'

1411
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,920
He felt himself again.

1412
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,840
His fear had gone away.

1413
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,280
In a few moments Alan Campbell walked in.

1414
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,240
He looked very angry and rather worried.

1415
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,360
'Alan! This is kind of you.

1416
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,560
I thank you for coming.'

1417
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,960
'I hoped never to enter your house again, Gray.

1418
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,280
But you said it was a question of life and death.'

1419
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,320
His voice was hard and cold, and he kept 
his hands in the pockets of his coat.

1420
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,080
'Yes, it is a question of life and death, Alan.

1421
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,400
And to more than one person.

1422
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:15,840
Sit down.'

1423
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,880
Campbell took a chair by the 
table, and Dorian sat opposite him.

1424
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,200
The two men's eyes met.

1425
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,080
In Dorian's there was great sadness.

1426
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,840
He knew that what he was going to do was terrible.

1427
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,280
After a moment of silence, 
Dorian said very quietly,  

1428
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:39,680
'Alan, in a locked room at the top of the 
house, a dead man is sitting at a table.

1429
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,640
He has been dead for ten hours now.

1430
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,440
Don't stir, and don't look at me like that.

1431
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,160
You don't need to know who this man is.

1432
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,280
You don't need to know how or why he died.

1433
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,000
What you have to do is this -'

1434
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,640
'Stop, Gray.

1435
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,520
I don't want to know anything more.

1436
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,240
I don't care if what you 
tell me is true or not true.

1437
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,320
I don't want any part in your life.

1438
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,920
Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.

1439
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,160
They don't interest me any more.'

1440
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,040
'Alan, they will have to interest you.

1441
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,160
I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.

1442
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,760
But I can't help myself.

1443
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,840
You are the one man who can save me.

1444
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
Alan, you are a scientist.

1445
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,000
You know about chemistry, and things of that kind.

1446
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:24,160
What you have got to do is to 
destroy the thing that is upstairs.'

1447
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,040
'You are mad, Dorian.

1448
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,400
I will have nothing to do with this.'

1449
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,880
'He killed himself, Alan.'

1450
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,720
'I am glad of that.

1451
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,520
But who made him do it? You, I suppose.'

1452
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,720
'Do you still refuse to do this for me?'

1453
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,960
'Of course I refuse.

1454
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,240
You have come to the wrong man.

1455
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,360
Go to some of your friends.

1456
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,160
Don't come to me.'

1457
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,520
'Alan, it was murder.

1458
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,240
I killed him.

1459
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,320
You don't know what he made me suffer.'

1460
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:56,560
'Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have 
come to? I will have nothing to do with it.'

1461
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,080
'You must have something to do with it.

1462
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,520
Don't ask any more questions.

1463
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,880
I have told you too much already.

1464
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,200
But you must do this.

1465
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,600
We were friends once, Alan.'

1466
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,120
'Don't speak of those days, Dorian.

1467
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:09,760
They are dead.'

1468
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,200
'They will hang me for this, Alan.

1469
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,080
Don't you understand? They will 
kill me for what I have done.'

1470
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,320
Campbell got up to leave.

1471
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,280
'I will not have anything to do with this.'

1472
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,200
'You refuse?'

1473
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,320
'Yes.'

1474
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,880
The same look of sadness 
came into Dorian Gray's eyes.

1475
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,400
Then he took a piece of paper 
and wrote something on it.

1476
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,840
He read it over and pushed it across the table.

1477
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,320
Then he got up and went over to the window.

1478
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,560
Campbell looked at him in 
surprise and picked up the paper.

1479
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,800
As he read it, his face went white, 
and he fell back in his chair.

1480
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,760
After two or three minutes without 
speaking, Dorian came and stood next to him.

1481
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,560
'I am very sorry for you, Alan,' he 
said, putting his hand on his shoulder.

1482
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,840
'But there is no other way.

1483
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,920
I have a letter written already.

1484
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:02,720
Here it is.

1485
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,840
You see the address.

1486
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,000
If you don't help me, I will send it.

1487
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,680
You know what will happen.

1488
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,080
But you are going to help me.

1489
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,960
It is impossible for you to refuse now.'

1490
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,840
Campbell put his face in his hands.

1491
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,320
'The thing is quite simple, Alan.

1492
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,600
It has to be done.

1493
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,120
Face it, and do it.'

1494
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,200
A terrible sound came from Campbell's lips.

1495
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:31,840
'Come, Alan, you must decide now.'

1496
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,040
Alan paused for a moment.

1497
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,160
'Is there a fire in the room upstairs?'

1498
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,560
'Yes, there is a gas fire.'

1499
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,840
'I must go home and get some...

1500
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:45,840
things.'

1501
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,200
'No, Alan, you must not leave the house.

1502
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,960
Write out what you want, and my 
servant will get the things for you.'

1503
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,520
It was nearly two o'clock when 
the servant returned with an  

1504
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,040
enormous wooden box filled with 
the things Campbell had asked for.

1505
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,080
'You can have the rest of the 
day to yourself, Francis.'

1506
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,160
'Thank you, sir.'

1507
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:13,520
When the servant had left, the two 
men carried the box up the stairs.

1508
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,600
Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.

1509
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,480
Then he stopped and Campbell saw 
that his eyes were full of tears.

1510
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,560
'I don't think I can go in, Alan,' he said.

1511
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,960
'I don't need you,' said Campbell coldly.

1512
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,680
Dorian half opened the door.

1513
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,400
As he did so, he saw the face of the 
portrait staring in the sunlight.

1514
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,920
He remembered that the night before 
he had forgotten to cover the picture.

1515
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,520
He was about to rush forward when he 
saw something that made him jump back.

1516
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,360
There was blood on one of 
the hands in the portrait.

1517
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
How horrible it was!

1518
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,840
He hurried into the room, trying 
not to look at the dead man.

1519
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,760
Picking the curtain off the floor 
he threw it over the picture.

1520
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,840
Then he rushed out of the 
room and down the stairs.

1521
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,720
It was long after seven when 
Campbell came back into the library.

1522
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,560
He was quiet and white in the face, but very calm.

1523
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,360
'I have done what you asked me to do,' he said.

1524
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,360
'And now goodbye.

1525
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,240
Let us never see each other again.'

1526
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,240
'You have saved me, Alan.

1527
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,440
I cannot forget that,' said Dorian, simply.

1528
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,440
When Campbell had left he went upstairs.

1529
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,160
There was a horrible smell in the room.

1530
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,960
But the thing that had been 
sitting at the table was gone.

1531
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,240
CHAPTER TWELVE

1532
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,120
'Why Do You Look so Young?'

1533
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,720
'Don't tell me that you are going 
to be good,' cried Lord Henry.

1534
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,840
'You're quite perfect.

1535
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,280
Don't change.'

1536
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,640
Dorian Gray shook his head.

1537
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,640
'No, Harry, I have done too 
many terrible things in my life.

1538
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,000
I am not going to do any more.

1539
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,840
But tell me, what is happening here in London?  

1540
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,560
I have been out of the country 
for more than a month.'

1541
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,600
'People are still discussing 
poor Basil's disappearance.'

1542
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,400
'Are they not bored with that yet?' said 
Dorian, pouring out some wine and frowning.

1543
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,640
'My dear boy, they have only been 
talking about it for six weeks.

1544
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,640
The British only need one subject 
of conversation every three months.

1545
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,040
They have been very lucky recently, though.

1546
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:36,880
First there was the scandal of my wife leaving 
me, and then Alan Campbell killed himself.

1547
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,560
Now there is the mysterious 
disappearance of an artist.

1548
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,080
The British police are saying that Basil did 
take the midnight train on the ninth of November,  

1549
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,320
but the French police are sure that 
he never arrived in Paris at all.'

1550
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,280
'What do you think has happened to Basil?' asked 
Dorian, holding up his wine against the light.

1551
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,520
'I have no idea.

1552
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:03,520
If Basil wants to hide himself, 
it is no business of mine.

1553
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,240
If he is dead, I don't want to think about him.

1554
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,440
Death is the only thing that ever frightens me.

1555
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,240
I hate it.'

1556
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,480
'Why?' said the younger man, in a tired voice.

1557
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:19,520
'Because,' said Lord Henry, 'it 
is the only thing that is final.

1558
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,520
Let us have our coffee in the music room, Dorian.

1559
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,040
You must play Chopin to me.

1560
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,640
The man who ran away with my 
wife played Chopin beautifully.

1561
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,560
Poor Victoria!

1562
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,480
I was very fond of her.

1563
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,400
The house is quite lonely without her.'

1564
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:40,480
Dorian said nothing, but went into 
the next room and sat at the piano.

1565
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:44,480
After the coffee had been 
brought in, he stopped playing.

1566
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,280
'Harry,' he said, looking over at Lord Henry.

1567
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,760
'Do you think Basil was murdered?'

1568
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,160
Lord Henry yawned.

1569
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,280
'Everyone liked Basil.

1570
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,880
Who would want to murder him?

1571
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,360
He was not clever enough to have enemies.

1572
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,040
Of course he was a wonderful painter.

1573
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,760
But a man can paint like Velasquez 
and yet still be rather boring.

1574
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,480
Basil was really rather boring.

1575
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:14,400
The only thing that interested me 
about him was that he worshipped you.'

1576
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,680
'I was very fond of Basil,' said Dorian sadly.

1577
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,120
'But don't people say he was murdered?'

1578
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,920
'Oh, some newspapers do.

1579
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,360
But I don't think it is likely.

1580
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,320
I know there are awful places in Paris, but 
Basil was not the sort of man to go to them.'

1581
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:41,280
'What would you say, Harry, if I told you that 
I had murdered Basil?' said the younger man.

1582
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,640
He watched him carefully after he had spoken.

1583
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,840
'No, Dorian, you would not murder anyone.

1584
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,840
It is ordinary people who murder.

1585
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,520
It is their way of finding the 
extraordinary pleasure that art gives us.'

1586
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,840
'A way of finding the extraordinary pleasure?  

1587
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,600
Do you think that a man who 
has murdered could do it again.

1588
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,360
Don't tell me that.'

1589
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:11,520
'Oh! Anything becomes a pleasure if you do 
it too often,' cried Lord Henry, laughing.

1590
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,400
'That is one of the most 
important secrets of life.

1591
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,320
I believe, though, that 
murder is always a mistake.

1592
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,840
One should never do anything one 
cannot talk about after dinner.

1593
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,800
But let us pass from poor Basil.

1594
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,720
I wish I could believe that he has 
died some romantic death, but I can't.

1595
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,760
He probably fell into the Seine off a bus.

1596
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,840
I can see him now lying on his 
back in the dirty green water.

1597
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,440
During the last ten years he 
had not been painting well.'

1598
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,520
Lord Henry walked across the room and touched  

1599
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,240
the head of a strange grey bird 
that he kept in the music room.

1600
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,640
Then he turned to face Dorian.

1601
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,040
'Yes,' he continued, taking his 
handkerchief out of his pocket,  

1602
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,480
'his painting seemed to me to have lost something.

1603
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,640
When you and he stopped being great 
friends, he stopped being a great artist.

1604
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:03,680
What was it that separated you?

1605
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,960
I suppose he bored you.

1606
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,520
If so, he never forgave you.

1607
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,760
By the way, what happened to that 
wonderful portrait he did of you?  

1608
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,000
I don't think I have ever 
seen it since he finished it.'

1609
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,840
'I told you years ago that it was stolen.'

1610
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,240
'Oh! I remember.

1611
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,080
You never got it back?

1612
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,080
What a shame!

1613
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,440
It really was wonderful.

1614
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,360
I remember I wanted to buy it.

1615
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,480
I wish I had it now.'

1616
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,800
'I never really liked it,' said Dorian.

1617
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
'I am sorry I sat for it.

1618
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,320
The memory of the thing is hateful to me.'

1619
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,880
'How sad you look! Don't be so serious.

1620
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,320
Play me some music, Dorian.

1621
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,440
And, as you play, tell me in a low 
voice why you still look so young.

1622
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,880
I am only ten years older than you are, 
and I have grey hair and yellow skin.

1623
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,280
You are really wonderful, Dorian.'

1624
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,000
'Harry, please -'

1625
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,480
'You have never looked more 
charming than you do tonight.

1626
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,680
You remind me of the day I first saw you.

1627
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:07,120
You were very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.

1628
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,560
You have changed, of course, 
but not in appearance.

1629
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,320
You are still the same.'

1630
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,360
'I am not the same, Harry.'

1631
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,680
'Yes, you are the same.

1632
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,560
I wish I could change places with you, Dorian.

1633
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,280
The world has cried out against us 
both, but it has always worshipped you.

1634
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,840
It always will worship you.

1635
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,920
Life has been your art.'

1636
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,800
Dorian got up from the piano, and 
passed his hand through his hair.

1637
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:42,640
'Yes, life has been beautiful,' he said, quietly, 
'but I am not going to have the same life, Harry.

1638
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,400
And you must not say these things to me.

1639
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,640
You don't know everything about me.

1640
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,240
I think that if you did, even 
you would turn away from me.

1641
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:51,840
You laugh.

1642
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:53,520
Don't laugh.'

1643
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:59,040
'Why have you stopped playing, 
Dorian? Let us go to the club.

1644
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,400
It has been a charming evening, 
and we must end it charmingly.

1645
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,480
There is someone I want to 
introduce to you - young Lord Poole.

1646
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,800
He has already copied your ties 
and he very much wants to meet you.

1647
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,360
He is quite charming and he reminds me of you.'

1648
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,080
'I hope not,' said Dorian, 
with a sad look in his eyes.

1649
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,120
'But I am tired tonight, Harry.

1650
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,240
I won't go to the club.

1651
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,120
It is nearly eleven, and I 
want to go to bed early.'

1652
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,120
'Please stay.

1653
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,000
You have never played so well as tonight.'

1654
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,560
'It is because I am going to 
be good,' he answered, smiling.

1655
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,840
'I am a little changed already.'

1656
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,000
'You can't change to me, Dorian,' said Lord Henry.

1657
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,760
'You and I will always be friends.

1658
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,880
Come round tomorrow.

1659
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,840
We shall go to lunch.'

1660
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,360
'Do you really want me to come, Harry?'

1661
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,200
'Certainly.

1662
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,520
The park is quite lovely now.

1663
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:57,440
I don't think there have been such 
flowers since the year I met you.'

1664
01:43:59,120 --> 01:43:59,600
'Very well.

1665
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,320
I shall be here at eleven,' said Dorian.

1666
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,840
'Good-night, Harry.'

1667
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,200
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1668
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,280
'To Kill the Past'

1669
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,320
It was a lovely night.

1670
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,320
He walked home, with his coat on 
his arm, smoking his cigarette.

1671
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,840
Two young men in evening dress passed him.

1672
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,680
He heard one of them whisper to 
the other, 'That is Dorian Gray'.

1673
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,880
He remembered how pleased he used to be 
when he was stared at, or talked about.

1674
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,000
He was tired of hearing his own name now.

1675
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,880
When he reached home, he found 
his servant waiting up for him.

1676
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,400
He sent him to bed, and threw himself 
down on the sofa in the library.

1677
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,720
He began to think about some of the 
things that Lord Henry had said to him.

1678
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,320
Was it really true that one could never change?

1679
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,240
There had been a time when he 
had been good and innocent.

1680
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:57,280
He had corrupted himself, and become 
a terrible influence on others.

1681
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,320
He had even got pleasure from this corruption.

1682
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,680
Yet his soul had once been the purest of all.

1683
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,760
Was all that gone?

1684
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,680
Was there no hope for him?

1685
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,920
In one terrible moment of passion, he 
had asked to stay young for all time.

1686
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,560
All his failure had been because of that.

1687
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,680
He had not been punished, but perhaps 
punishment was what he had needed.

1688
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,400
Punishment cleaned the soul.

1689
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:31,280
The mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so 
many years ago now, was standing on the table.

1690
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,680
He picked it up,  

1691
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:37,280
remembering that horrible night when he had 
first noticed the change in the picture.

1692
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,240
Once, someone who had loved him 
passionately had written him a mad letter.

1693
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:49,600
It had ended with these words: 'The world 
is changed because you are made of gold.'

1694
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,920
He repeated them to himself and suddenly 
realized that he hated his own beauty.

1695
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,640
Throwing the mirror on the floor, he broke 
the glass into little pieces with his foot.

1696
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,600
It was his beauty that had spoiled him.

1697
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,160
It was better not to think of the past.

1698
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:09,200
Nothing could change that.

1699
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,000
He had to think of his future.

1700
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,320
Alan Campbell had shot himself one night, 
and his terrible secret had died with him.

1701
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,560
The interest in Basil Hallward's 
disappearance would soon pass away.

1702
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,920
He was perfectly safe there.

1703
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:26,160
What worried him was the death of his own soul.

1704
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,880
Basil had painted the portrait 
that had destroyed his life.

1705
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,440
He could not forgive him that.

1706
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,480
It was the portrait that had done everything.

1707
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,280
The murder had just been 
the madness of the moment.

1708
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,200
As for Alan Campbell, he had killed himself.

1709
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,040
It was nothing to do with Dorian Gray.

1710
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,240
A new life!

1711
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,200
That was what he wanted.

1712
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,200
That was what he was waiting for.

1713
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:51,920
Perhaps it had begun already.

1714
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,800
He would never again spoil innocence.

1715
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,600
He would be good.

1716
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,720
He began to wonder if the portrait 
in the locked room had changed.

1717
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,200
Was it still as horrible as it had been?

1718
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,320
Perhaps if his life became pure, the face in 
the portrait would become beautiful again.

1719
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,120
He would go and look.

1720
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,720
He took the lamp from the table and went upstairs.

1721
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,600
As he opened the door, a smile of 
happiness passed across his young face.

1722
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,400
Yes, he would be good, and the ugly thing he 
had locked away would not frighten him any more.

1723
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,040
He felt happier already.

1724
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,760
He went in quietly, locking the door behind him.

1725
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,960
Walking straight over to the portrait, he took 
off the purple curtain that was covering it.

1726
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,720
An angry cry of pain came from him.

1727
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,120
He could see no change.

1728
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:46,240
The thing was still hateful - 
more hateful, even, than before.

1729
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,240
The red mark on the hand seemed 
brighter and more like new blood.

1730
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,280
And why was the red mark larger than it had been?

1731
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,680
It was all over the fingers now.

1732
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:00,800
There was blood on the painted feet, and 
blood on the hand that had not held the knife.

1733
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,240
What did it all mean?

1734
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,600
That he should go to the police?

1735
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,640
That he should tell the whole 
story, and be put to death?

1736
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,800
He laughed.

1737
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,240
He felt the idea was absurd.

1738
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,280
If he did tell them now, who would believe him?

1739
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,320
There was nothing left of 
the murdered man anywhere.

1740
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,600
He had destroyed everything 
belonging to Basil Hallward.

1741
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,480
He himself had burned the bag and the coat.

1742
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,040
They would simply say he was mad.

1743
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,840
Was this murder to follow him all his life?

1744
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,160
Was he always going to suffer because of his past?

1745
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,160
Yet what could he do?

1746
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,000
Go to the police?

1747
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,440
Never.

1748
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:45,840
There was only one thing they could use 
against him and that was the picture itself.

1749
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:47,600
He would destroy it.

1750
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,680
Why had he kept it so long?

1751
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,760
Once it had given him pleasure to 
watch it changing and growing old.

1752
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,880
Recently he had felt no such pleasure.

1753
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,560
It had kept him awake at night.

1754
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,760
When he had been away, he had been 
frightened that another person would see it.

1755
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,280
Just the memory of it spoiled 
many moments of happiness.

1756
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,120
He would destroy it.

1757
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,520
He looked around and saw the knife 
that had killed Basil Hallward.

1758
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,760
He had cleaned it many times until 
there was no mark left on it.

1759
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,240
It was bright, and it shone.

1760
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,240
It had killed the painter.

1761
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,080
Now it would kill the painter's 
work, and all that it meant.

1762
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,200
It would kill the past.

1763
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:28,880
When that was dead he would be free.

1764
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,840
He picked up the knife and 
pushed it into the picture.

1765
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,720
There was a cry, and a crash.

1766
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,760
The cry was so horrible that frightened 
servants woke and came out of their rooms.

1767
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,040
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square 
below, stopped, and looked up at the great house.

1768
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,400
They hurried on until they met a 
policeman, and brought him back.

1769
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,960
The policeman rang the bell several 
times, but there was no answer.

1770
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,520
Except for a light in one of the 
top windows, the house was all dark.

1771
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:07,200
After a time, he went away and stood in 
the garden of the next house and watched.

1772
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,160
'Whose house is that?' asked 
the older of the two gentlemen.

1773
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,080
'Mr Dorian Gray's, sir,' answered the policeman.

1774
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,120
They looked at each other as they 
walked away, and laughed cruelly.

1775
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,840
They knew who Dorian Gray was.

1776
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,280
Inside the house the servants were 
talking in low whispers to each other.

1777
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,600
Old Mrs Leaf was crying.

1778
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,720
Francis was as white as death.

1779
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,920
After about a quarter of an hour, 
they went fearfully upstairs.

1780
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,880
They knocked, but there was no reply.

1781
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:44,720
They called out.

1782
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,960
Everything was still.

1783
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,280
They tried the door.

1784
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,840
It was locked.

1785
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,840
Finally, they got on the roof and 
came into the room through the window.

1786
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,760
When they entered the room they 
found a portrait hanging on the wall.

1787
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:07,920
It showed Mr Dorian Gray as they had 
last seen him, young and beautiful.

1788
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,640
Lying on the floor was a 
dead man in evening dress.

1789
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,280
He had a knife in his heart.

1790
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:20,160
He was old and horribly ugly.

1791
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:30,320
It was not until they saw his rings 
that they recognized who the man was.
