00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,040
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,200
Three Bodies
 

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,320
The man who was waiting on the shore looked like 
a farmer. He wore the right kind of clothes,  

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,600
and his van, which was parked on the dirt road 
above the beach, was suitably covered in mud.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,880
It was midnight on the first Monday in October, 
and for the next thirty minutes he had to wait  

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,120
there. He stared out to sea. He was alone, as 
he knew he would be; it was planned that way.  

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,600
This beach was always empty at this time of 
night. No cars drove along the dirt road.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,160
The clouds were low and thick. It would be 
difficult to see the boat until it was close.  

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,240
That was planned as well.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,720
After he had waited twenty minutes he heard 
the sound of a quiet engine from the water  

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,680
and then saw a black rubber boat, 
low in the water, approach the shore.  

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,160
The engine stopped when the boat was 
about thirty feet from the shore.  

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,240
The farmer looked around. 
There were no people, no cars.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
He carefully put a cigarette in 
his mouth and started to smoke it.  

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,920
A man's voice came from the boat on the 
water: 'What kind of cigarette is that?'

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
'Lucky Strike,' the farmer answered.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Satisfied, the man in the boat asked, 'Luke?'

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,040
'Sam,' replied the farmer. The man in the 
boat was Khamel, not Sam, and Luke knew it.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
Luke had often heard of Khamel, but he 
was not sure that they had met before.  

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,520
Khamel had many names and many faces, and 
he spoke several languages. He was the most  

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,760
famous and most feared killer in the world. He 
was the best. At first, twenty years ago, he had  

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,000
killed for political reasons, but now he would 
kill anyone, anywhere, if the money was right.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,920
Luke was excited. Khamel was going to be 
working in America. He wondered who was  

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,400
going to die. Whoever it was, the killing would 
be quick and clean, and there would be no clues.

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,640
At dawn, the stolen van stopped at a hotel 
in Georgetown, part of Washington, DC, the  

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,120
political capital of the United States of America. 
Khamel got out of the van without a word to Luke.  

27
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
They had not spoken throughout the journey, and 
Luke had been careful not to look at Khamel.  

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,840
He didn't want to die; he didn't want 
Khamel to think he could recognize him.

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,320
The room in the hotel was ready, of 
course. The curtains were tightly closed.  

30
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,320
The car keys were on the table. The 
gun was in a briefcase next to the bed.

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,960
He had received three million 
dollars already for this job.  

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,400
He would phone his bank in three hours to ask 
whether the next four million had arrived.  

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,440
While he waited, he practised his English in 
front of the mirror. The job would be over by  

34
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,160
midnight tonight, so another three million 
would reach his bank by midday tomorrow.  

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,480
By then he would be in Paris. It was 
satisfactory. He allowed himself a short sleep.

36
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
***

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:43,360
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the USA. 
It consists of nine judges, who hear only the most  

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,800
difficult cases in the country - those cases 
which might actually threaten the Constitution.  

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,520
Judges are appointed to the Supreme Court by the 
government, so a Republican government will try to  

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,680
get Republican judges appointed and a Democratic 
government will try to get Democrats appointed.  

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,240
Judges become members of 
the Supreme Court for life.  

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,880
They can retire if they want, but 
if not the job ends only with death.  

43
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,800
Judge Rosenberg was so old that he found it hard 
to stay awake sometimes, even during trials. He  

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,880
was a liberal, and proud of it. He defended the 
Indians, the homosexuals, the poor, the blacks,  

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:42,080
the Mexicans and the Puerto Ricans. Some people 
loved him for it, but more people hated him.

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Throughout the summer there had been 
the usual number of messages threatening  

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,560
death to the judges of the Supreme Court, and as 
usual Rosenberg had received more than the others.  

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,160
The FBI had to behave as if the 
judges really were in danger,  

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,280
although they were threatened year after year 
and it was very rare for anything to happen.  

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,320
When it did, it was usually a single madman, whose 
daughter had died in a road accident or something.  

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,520
The political groups made a lot of noise, but it 
was easier for them to bomb buildings than people,  

52
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,840
and especially people who were as well 
guarded as the Supreme Court judges.

53
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:32,160
Rosenberg refused to have FBI guards in his own 
home; he had lived to be ninety-one and was not  

54
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,800
afraid of death. Judge Jensen had different 
reasons for not wanting guards in his house:  

55
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,440
he wanted to be able to come and go as he pleased. 
Both of them allowed the guards to wait outside,  

56
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
in cars or on foot, but they could enter 
the house only when they had permission.

57
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
A little after ten at night, when 
the house was dark and still,  

58
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,000
the door to a bedroom cupboard opened and 
Khamel came quietly out. He was dressed  

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,040
in running clothes. He had shaved off 
his beard and coloured his hair blond.

60
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
Silently, he went down the stairs.  

61
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
He knew there were two FBI men in a car that was 
parked on the road outside the front of the house;  

62
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,160
he knew there was another guard, Ferguson, 
walking around the house outside.

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,760
Rosenberg and his male nurse were 
asleep in the downstairs bedroom.  

64
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
Outside the door, Khamel fitted 
a silencer on to his gun.  

65
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,400
He stepped inside, put the gun to the 
head of the nurse and fired three times.  

66
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,760
The hands and legs jumped, but the eyes 
stayed closed, and there was no sound. Khamel  

67
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,360
quickly reached across to the grey old head of 
Judge Rosenberg and shot three bullets into it.

68
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,760
He watched the two bodies for a full minute, 
and then went out to the kitchen. He opened  

69
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,680
the back door, waited until Ferguson appeared 
in the back garden, and then called his name.  

70
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,920
He knew that the nurse often invited Ferguson 
in for a cup of coffee and something to eat.

71
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
Ferguson obediently came into the kitchen.  

72
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,720
Khamel fired three bullets into the back of 
his head and he fell loudly on to the table.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Khamel left the gun there and 
went out of the back door.  

74
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,880
As soon as he reached the road at the 
back of the house, he began running.

75
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,520
He was just another American, 
out for his nightly run.

76
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
***

77
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,320
In the dark of the Montrose Theatre, Glenn 
Jensen sat by himself and watched the men on  

78
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,120
the big screen in the front of the theatre. He 
was dressed in ordinary clothes - clothes that  

79
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,840
no one would remember - and wore dark glasses too. 
Nobody would know that he had been here. He came  

80
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,120
to this homosexual film theatre once or twice a 
week, and not even his FBI guards knew about it.

81
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,520
It was easy to get out of the house. There 
were several apartments in the building,  

82
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,360
and the two FBI men could watch 
only one entrance at a time.  

83
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,040
All he had to do was change his clothes 
and drive away in a friend's car.  

84
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,240
He liked the Montrose because the films went 
on all night and there was never a crowd.  

85
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,560
Tonight there were only two old men, sitting 
together in the middle of the theatre  

86
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,920
and holding hands. Jensen watched their backs and 
wondered if he would be like them in twenty years.  

87
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,040
At forty-four, he was the youngest 
of the Supreme Court judges.

88
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,480
He was not a favourite of either the Republicans 
or the Democrats, but had been a safe appointment  

89
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,360
for the Republican President four years ago. He 
was not particularly liberal, except in cases  

90
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,320
involving homosexuals and those where industry 
threatened the environment. He usually tried to  

91
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,160
judge his cases according to their rights and 
wrongs, rather than any political opinions.

92
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
A fourth person entered the theatre where 
Jensen and the two old men were now enjoying  

93
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,120
a film in which several young men were in bed 
together. He wore tight jeans, a black shirt,  

94
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,960
an earring, dark glasses and a 
moustache. Khamel the homosexual.  

95
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,760
He smiled when he saw Jensen there. The 
information they had given him was good.

96
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,160
At 12:20 the old men left the theatre, 
arm in arm. Jensen did not look at them;  

97
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,000
he was too busy watching the film. Khamel 
moved like a cat to a seat behind Jensen.  

98
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,400
He pulled some rope from round his waist and 
wrapped the ends round his hands. He suddenly  

99
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,280
put the rope around the front of Jensen's 
neck and pulled backwards and downwards.  

100
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,920
Jensen's neck broke over the back 
of his seat. Just to make sure,  

101
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Khamel twisted the rope until it bit deeply into 
Jensen's neck and held it there for two minutes.

102
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,080
An hour later he was waiting at Dulles 
airport for his flight to Paris.
 
 
 
 
 

103
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
CHAPTER TWO

104
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Political Planning
 

105
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,640
The phone woke the President 
at 4:30 in the morning.  

106
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,600
He listened to the voice for a 
minute and then jumped out of bed.  

107
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,840
Eight minutes later he was in the office. Fletcher 
Coal, his chief of staff, was waiting for him.

108
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
'What the hell happened?' the President asked.

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,400
Coal walked up and down in front of the 
President's desk. 'We don't know much,' he said.  

110
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:34,640
'They're both dead. Two FBI men found Rosenberg 
at one a.m. His nurse and guard were also dead.

111
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,520
Three bullets each - very clean, very 
professional. While the FBI were at  

112
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,200
Rosenberg's house, they heard that the police 
had found Jensen's body in a homosexual club.  

113
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,040
Voyles called me, and I called 
you. He'll be here in a minute.'

114
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
'Rosenberg is dead,' the President said.

115
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:07,680
'Yes. At last.' Rosenberg and the Republican 
Government had not been friends. 'I suggest  

116
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,800
you go on TV in two or three hours' 
time and tell the country about it all.  

117
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,000
Mabry is already working on your speech. 
We don't want to leave it until later,  

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,800
because we want to be the first to tell 
them. The press already have the news.'

119
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
'I didn't know he was a homosexual.'

120
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,960
'There's no doubt about it now. This is 
the perfect crisis. We didn't cause it;  

121
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,920
we didn't do anything wrong. The country will be 
shocked and they'll turn to you. You're going to  

122
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,840
be more popular than ever, and next year you'll be 
elected again for another four years. It's great.'

123
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,000
'And I can get two new men 
into the Supreme Court.'

124
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,040
'Exactly. That's the best 
bit. They'll be your men,  

125
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,840
and they'll be there for ever. You'll 
have a first list of names by tomorrow.'

126
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,120
'Are there any suspects?'

127
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,480
'Not yet.'

128
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,720
The President smiled. 'Voyles's FBI men were 
supposed to protect the judges, weren't they?  

129
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,960
Good. I want you to leak that information to 
the press. Maybe we can get rid of Voyles too.'

130
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,840
When Voyles arrived a moment later, the 
President and Coal tried to look worried.  

131
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,640
Voyles told them that there were no suspects yet,  

132
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,840
and the President asked for a 
list by five o'clock that evening.  

133
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,520
They agreed that the killings must be connected. 
Voyles denied that his men had been careless.

134
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,280
'Rosenberg and Jensen are dead because they 
refused to let us guard them properly,'  

135
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,840
he said. 'We're guarding the other 
seven, and they're still alive.'

136
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,400
'At the moment,' the President said, 
and looked at Coal. They almost smiled.  

137
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,680
They could easily make Voyles look stupid 
and inefficient over this business.  

138
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,720
Voyles knew it too. He was 
going to have to be careful.  

139
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,720
The President - or rather Coal, who told the 
President what to think - wanted his head, and  

140
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,760
the press would eat him alive. Back in his office, 
he ordered a full enquiry into the murders.

141
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
***

142
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,000
Darby Shaw woke up a little before dawn. After 
fifteen months of law school at Tulane University  

143
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,600
in New Orleans, her mind refused to rest for more 
than six hours. The work had not been so hard at  

144
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,840
her first university, in Phoenix, Arizona, where 
she had specialized in environmental science.  

145
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,280
Then she decided to become a lawyer and 
to defend the environment in the courts.  

146
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
The price was hard work and more hard work.

147
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,840
There were some rewards, however. She turned 
over in the bed to look at the man sleeping  

148
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,960
next to her. Thomas Callahan was one of the 
most popular teachers in the university. He was  

149
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:30,960
forty-five years old, but seemed a lot younger. 
He drank a lot, wore jeans, drove a Porsche, lived  

150
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:37,840
in the French Quarter and managed to make even 
constitutional law interesting. He was also good  

151
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,640
in bed. And for the first time in his life he had 
stayed with one woman for more than a few weeks.  

152
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,560
Darby and he had been together now for 
several months. She smiled and wondered  

153
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,000
what her fellow students would think. Only 
her very best friends knew the secret.

154
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,640
She turned the TV on and suddenly there was the 
President. She listened for a minute and then  

155
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:15,920
shook Thomas awake. 'Thomas! Wake up! Listen 
to this!' She turned the sound up louder.

156
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,120
Callahan sat up and stared at the screen, still 
half asleep. He understood what the President  

157
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:33,040
was saying, though. 'Rosenberg? Murdered?' he 
said. Darby knew that Rosenberg was his hero.

158
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
'Jensen too,' she said.

159
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,560
The President finished his speech 
and Darby switched the TV off.

160
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,320
'No suspects, according to 
the President,' Callahan said.

161
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,840
'I can think of at least twenty groups 
who wanted Rosenberg dead,' Darby said,  

162
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
'starting with the Ku-Klux-Klan.'

163
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,360
'Yeah, but why those two judges? OK, 
lots of people wanted Rosenberg dead,  

164
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,240
but why Jensen? Why not McDowell or Yount? 
They're both more liberal than Jensen.'

165
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,800
'Maybe they both just got killed 
on the same night by chance,'

166
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,920
Darby suggested, without believing it.

167
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,440
'No, I don't think so,' said Callahan. 'These 
are the first Supreme Court judges ever to be  

168
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,800
murdered - and then two in one night? There 
must be some connection between the murders.  

169
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,040
But you know the worst thing? That 
fool President will be able to fill  

170
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,680
their places. That means that eight 
out of the nine will be Republicans.  

171
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,840
We won't be able to recognize the 
Constitution in ten years. This is awful.'

172
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
'Perhaps that's why they were killed, Thomas.  

173
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,600
Someone or some group wants a different 
Supreme Court, filled with Republicans.'

174
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,480
'But why Jensen? He was 
appointed by a Republican.'

175
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,880
'I don't know, but there must be some connection.  

176
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Maybe there's a clue in the cases the 
Supreme Court was due to hear this year.  

177
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,600
The library will have that information. I think 
I'll spend some time on this today.'
 
 
 
 
 

178
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,400
CHAPTER THREE

179
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,080
No Clues
 

180
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,760
Denton Voyles put Eric East in charge of the 
case. On Thursday, East reported back to Voyles  

181
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:39,040
with a list of their top suspects. There were 
a number of political groups - especially the  

182
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:46,960
Underground Army, the Ku-Klux-Klan and the White 
Defenders - but also some individuals who were  

183
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,680
rich enough to afford the kind of professional 
killer who had obviously done this job.  

184
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,080
There was Nelson Muncie, who had lost 
his daughter in a sex killing in Florida;  

185
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,760
the police had caught the man, who 
was black, but thanks to Rosenberg  

186
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,200
the man had walked free. There was Clinton Lane, 
whose son was a homosexual who had died of Aids.  

187
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,320
The problem with all these suspects, however, was 
that the killings were so professional and clean  

188
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,000
that there were no clues except 
for the gun and the rope.  

189
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,320
There were not even any clues about how the killer 
had entered Rosenberg's house. Still, Voyles and  

190
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,840
he agreed to have between five and twenty men 
investigate each suspect or group of suspects.

191
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,640
In the law library and on the 
computers of Tulane University,  

192
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,800
Darby Shaw was gathering pages 
and pages of information.

193
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,640
What was the connection between Rosenberg and 
Jensen? She could see reasons for killing one  

194
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,560
or the other, but not both together. 
But there had to be a single reason.

195
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
***

196
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,240
Thomas Callahan slept late and alone. Darby 
had been too busy to see him since Wednesday.  

197
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,680
Now it was Friday morning. 
He made some coffee and,  

198
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,840
as he drank it, watched the busy 
French Quarter through his window.

199
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,480
What was it he had to do? Oh, yes, phone 
Gavin. On Monday he was going to Washington  

200
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,680
for a conference about constitutional law. He 
and his old friend Gavin Verheek were going to  

201
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,840
meet and get drunk together on Monday evening. 
Gavin had been a friend ever since law school.  

202
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,000
He and Callahan were the only two in their year 
who refused to go into private practice and  

203
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,440
get rich. While Callahan had become a teacher, 
Verheek had joined the FBI as a legal adviser.

204
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,160
When Verheek came on the phone, 
he said, 'Thomas, how are you?'

205
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,440
'It's ten-thirty. I'm not dressed. 
I'm sitting here in the French  

206
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,760
Quarter drinking coffee and watching 
the world outside. What are you doing?'

207
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,120
'Well, here it's eleven-thirty,  

208
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
and I haven't left the office since they 
found the bodies on Wednesday morning.'

209
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,040
'It makes me sick, Gavin. The President 
will get two Nazis on to the Supreme Court.  

210
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,600
I suppose you've already seen the list. I bet 
your office is already checking that they've  

211
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:42,320
lived good, clean lives. Go on, Gavin, tell me 
who's on the list. I won't tell anyone else.'

212
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,400
'No chance. I'll only tell you 
this: your name's not on the list'

213
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,120
'I'm so disappointed.'

214
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,640
'How's the girl?'

215
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,240
'Which one?'

216
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
'Come on, Thomas. The girl?'

217
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
'She's beautiful and brilliant and gentle. Oh,  

218
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,560
and rich. She has red hair and the 
longest legs you've ever seen.'

219
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
'Wow! What's her name?'

220
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:19,680
'Darby Shaw. But I haven't seen her for a couple 
of days. She's trying to solve the murders all  

221
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,720
by herself. Why don't you tell me who did it, and 
then I can tell her and she'll come back to me?'

222
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,640
'Don't you read the papers? 
We have no suspects. Not one.'

223
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,680
'At least I tried. Are we 
going to meet on Monday?'

224
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,320
'I hope so. Voyles wants us to work day and 
night until the computers tell us who did it.'

225
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,840
'I'll expect a full report on 
Monday, Gavin - not just the gossip.'

226
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,960
'Why don't you bring Darby? 
How old is she? Nineteen?'

227
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
'Twenty-four, and she's not invited.  

228
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,080
I'll see you on Monday at seven 
p.m., in the usual restaurant. OK?'

229
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,280
'OK. See you.'

230
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
***

231
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,680
Darby's enquiries had brought her to the court 
in Lafayette. Of all the Supreme Court cases due  

232
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,080
to be heard in the next few months, there 
was one that could explain the killings.  

233
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,160
She needed to see the court's files on the case. 
When the clerk brought them to her table, however,  

234
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:37,120
her heart sank. There were lots of files, each 
inches thick. The case was seven years old.  

235
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,920
Only one person was involved, but he had hidden 
behind thirty-eight different businesses,  

236
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:50,240
which had used no fewer than fifteen 
law firms over the last seven years.

237
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
She pulled her chair in to the 
table and began to work.
 
 
 
 
 

238
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,880
CHAPTER FOUR

239
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
Ideas and Information
 

240
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,960
The meeting East and Voyles had with Coal and 
the President did not go well. Not only could  

241
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,160
they not report any progress, but they had to 
admit that investigations like this could take  

242
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,720
many months. Then Coal handed Voyles a list of 
eight possible members of the Supreme Court,  

243
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:31,200
two of whom would fill the places left empty by 
Rosenberg and Jensen. 'We want a report on these  

244
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,600
people in ten days, Voyles,' he said, 'and make 
sure the press doesn't get to hear about them.'

245
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,480
'You know we can't promise that,' Voyles 
said. 'We can't guarantee no leaks. As soon  

246
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,720
as we start to dig around these people, 
someone will realize what's going on.'

247
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,480
'The FBI can't guarantee secrecy?'  

248
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,840
Coal said. 'You'd better keep 
this out of the papers, Voyles.'

249
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,520
Voyles jumped out of his chair. 
'Listen, Coal,' he shouted.  

250
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,600
'Why don't you investigate these people 
yourself? Don't start telling me what to do.'

251
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,880
The President tried to make peace. 'All 
we're saying is do your best, Voyles,'  

252
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,000
he said. 'These people are young 
and they're good Republicans.  

253
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,720
They'll be giving the Constitution shape long 
after I'm dead. So it's important to me that  

254
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,480
the two who become members of the Supreme Court 
are clean, so that they can stay there for ever.  

255
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,960
So no drugs, no unusual sexual 
habits - nothing like that. OK?'

256
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,560
'Yes, Mr President. But we 
cannot guarantee total secrecy.'

257
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,800
'I understand. Just try your best.'

258
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,840
'Yes, sir.'

259
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
***

260
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,960
Callahan went round to 
Darby's apartment with a pizza  

261
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,040
and a bottle of wine. He hadn't seen her 
for four days. He rang on her doorbell.

262
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,800
'Who is it?' she called through the door.

263
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
'Thomas Callahan,' he said. 'Do you remember me?'

264
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:25,200
The door opened and Callahan stepped in. 'Are we 
still friends?' he asked, and gave her a kiss.

265
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,800
'Of course. I've just been busy.'

266
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,760
'So what did the great detective find?'

267
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
She was opening the bottle of wine 
and didn't answer straight away.  

268
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,600
She poured wine into two glasses and 
they went and sat together on the sofa.  

269
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,760
She put her legs up on to him, and he 
stroked them. He repeated the question.

270
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,840
'Nothing, really. I was following 
a path, and it took me somewhere.  

271
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,480
I even typed it up as a brief, but 
I don't think it's worth anything.'

272
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,280
'What? You've been running around playing 
detective for four days, and refusing to see me,  

273
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,760
and now you're just going to throw it away?'

274
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
'It's over there on the table, 
if you want to see it,' she said.

275
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,840
'I don't want to see it now,' he said. 
'We have more important things to do.  

276
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm going to be away in Washington 
for a few days, remember?  

277
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,080
I'll read your brief and then we'll talk 
about it. But not till we've been to bed, OK?'

278
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,680
She pulled him towards her 
and they kissed long and hard.

279
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
***

280
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,560
There was a cleaner in the White House whom 
everyone called Sarge. He was old, very black,  

281
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,440
and had white hair. He wore dark glasses all the 
time, and everyone thought that he was half blind.

282
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:02,080
In fact, Sarge could see very 
well. He could see round corners.  

283
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,240
He had been working in the White House for thirty 
years now, cleaning and listening, cleaning  

284
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:17,120
and seeing. He knew which doors stayed open and 
which walls were thin. No one ever noticed him.

285
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:27,040
His son Cleve was a policeman. This is how it 
worked: Cleve would contact Gray Grantham of  

286
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,560
the Washington Post and arrange a meeting. 
Sarge and Grantham would meet. No one knew  

287
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,800
how Grantham got his political information, 
but it was always good and always correct.  

288
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,040
Sarge never talked to anyone except Grantham, and 
he didn't tell even him everything he found out.

289
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:58,320
This time they met at Glenda's, a little cafe 
on Fourteenth Street. Sarge was able to tell  

290
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,640
Grantham two of the people on the list 
of possible Supreme Court judges.

CHAPTER FIVE

292
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,880
An Implausible Theory
 

293
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,920
Verheek had drunk too much the 
night before with Callahan,  

294
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,480
as he had known he would. What had he 
said? Had he given away any secrets?  

295
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,880
He remembered explaining that the connection 
between Rosenberg and Jensen was not political.  

296
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,520
The connection was so obvious that for 
several days no one in the FBI had seen it.

297
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,600
They were killed because the 
killer could get to them.  

298
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,240
It was as simple as that. They 
weren't guarded as well as the others.  

299
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,280
Of course this still didn't answer the question 
why someone wanted two Supreme Court judges dead.

300
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,600
He remembered that they spent most of the evening 
talking about their student days together in  

301
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Washington, and about women. Callahan had given 
him a copy of the brief his girl-friend - what  

302
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:13,040
was her name? Darby - had written about the 
death of the two judges. Callahan had said it  

303
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,280
was an interesting theory. She didn't believe 
it, nor did he, but it was worth reading.

304
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,280
Verheek pulled the brief out of his 
briefcase now and started to read it.  

305
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:32,560
It was better written than most briefs, and 
he enjoyed it. The theory was implausible,  

306
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,360
but no one else had thought of it. It was worth 
considering. He would show it to Eric East.

307
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
***

308
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,880
The phone went four times, 
the answering machine came on,  

309
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,520
but the caller left no message. The phone 
went again, and the same thing happened again.  

310
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:03,840
The third time Grantham climbed out of bed and 
answered the phone. It was still dark. 'Yes?'

311
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,120
'Is that Gray Grantham, of the Washington Post?'

312
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
'It is. Who's calling?'

313
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,600
'I can't give you my name.'

314
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,360
'OK. Why are you calling?'

315
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,880
'I saw your story yesterday about the White House 
and the possible next two Supreme Court judges.'

316
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,720
'Good. But why are you calling 
me so early in the morning?'

317
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:42,320
'I'm sorry. I'm in a pay phone. I'm on my way 
to work. I can't call from home or the office.'

318
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,920
'What kind of office?'

319
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,800
'I'm a lawyer.'

320
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,800
Great. Washington was home to half a 
million lawyers. 'Private or government?'

321
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,200
'I'd rather not say.'

322
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,360
'OK. Anyway, why did you call?'

323
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,240
A hesitation. 'I may know something 
about Rosenberg and Jensen.'

324
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,320
Grantham sat up straight. 'What, exactly?'

325
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,440
'Are you recording this?'

326
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
'No. Should I?'

327
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,520
'I don't know, Mr Grantham. I'd prefer 
it if you didn't record this. OK?'

328
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,040
'Whatever you want. I'm listening.'

329
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
'Can you trace this call?'

330
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,360
'I could. But you're at a pay phone 
- what difference would it make?'

331
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,200
'You're right. I'm just frightened. You 
see, I think I know who killed them.'

332
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,320
Now Grantham was standing. 
'That's valuable information.'

333
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,080
'It could get me killed. Do you 
think they're following me?'

334
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
'Who? Don't worry. Tell me your name.'

335
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
'You can call me Garcia.'

336
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,960
'That's not your real name, is it?

337
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,000
'Of course not, but it's the best I can do.'

338
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,320
'OK, Garcia, talk to me.'

339
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,040
'I'm not certain, you understand. But 
I think I accidentally saw something  

340
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,200
at the office that I was not supposed to see.'

341
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
'Do you have a copy of it?'

342
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,040
'Maybe.'

343
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,680
'Do you want to talk or not?'

344
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,120
'I don't know. What will you 
do if I tell you something?'

345
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,520
'First try to find out whether it's true. We won't 
print the names of the killers of two Supreme  

346
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Court judges in a hurry, believe me.' There was a 
very long silence. 'Garcia, are you still there?'

347
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,840
'Yes. I need to think about 
this. I might call you later.'

348
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
'OK, if that's what you want.'

349
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,280
'Sorry I woke you up.'

350
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,120
The phone went dead. Grantham pushed seven 
numbers on his phone, waited, and then pushed  

351
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,800
six more. Another wait, and then four more. 
The small screen on his phone showed him a row  

352
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,680
of numbers. He wrote them down on a piece of 
paper. The pay phone was on Fifteenth Street.

353
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
***

354
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,480
East and K. O. Lewis, Voyles's second-in-command, 
met with Coal alone, because the President  

355
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,680
was out of Washington. They had two bits of 
information for him. First, they told him that  

356
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,680
cameras at the airport in Paris had recorded 
the arrival from Dulles of the killer Khamel.

357
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
Coal thought about this for a minute.  

358
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,400
'What if Khamel was involved in 
the killings? What does it mean?'

359
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,000
'It means we'll never find him,'  

360
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,200
Lewis replied. 'Nine countries around the world 
have failed to find him for the last twenty years.  

361
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,120
It means that he was paid a lot of money by 
someone or some people here to do the killings.'

362
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,200
'So we know or we think that Khamel did the 
killings, but it doesn't really help us, does it?'

363
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
No, you're right.'

364
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,400
'OK. What else have you got for me?'

365
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,520
Lewis looked at East. 'There's no 
real progress to report, except.

366
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,360
'Except what?'

367
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,600
'Well, there's this theory which has 
appeared in the last twenty- four hours.  

368
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,400
A law student in New Orleans wrote it up 
as a brief. We call it the Pelican Brief.  

369
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,880
Here's a copy of it. Voyles liked it, but 
he was afraid it could hurt the President.'

370
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,320
'How?'

371
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
'Read it. You'll see.'

372
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
***

373
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,520
This time Garcia called 
Grantham during office hours.  

374
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,840
He didn't tell him anything new. He 
was still frightened and uncertain.

375
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,920
They agreed that he would call 
again at lunch-time the next day.  

376
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,720
The call came from a pay 
phone on Pennsylvania Avenue.

377
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
***

378
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,920
Later, when the President returned, Coal told 
him about the brief. 'The theory is implausible,'  

379
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,040
he said. 'But Voyles likes it. He probably doesn't 
believe the theory any more than anyone else,  

380
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
but we've made him look bad 
over these killings so far  

381
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:48,560
and he wants revenge. He's going to investigate 
this new suspect. If the press get to hear about  

382
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,560
the investigation, that could be bad for 
you. We'd better do something about it.'

383
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,080
'Is the suspect someone we know?'

384
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,800
'Yes.' Coal explained what was in the brief.

385
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,480
'Did we get a lot of money from him?'

386
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:14,640
'Millions, one way or another,' said Coal. 
But the President preferred not to know the  

387
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,840
various ways in which money came in, especially 
when they weren't always perfectly legal.
 
 
 
 
 

388
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
CHAPTER SIX

389
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:27,920
Hunted!
 

390
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,840
Thomas was drinking too much over dinner. 
She didn't like it, and she told him so.  

391
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,800
He wanted to prove that she was wrong, so 
he drank even more. They had an argument.

392
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,840
After dinner, outside the restaurant, he pulled 
the keys to his Porsche out of his pocket.

393
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,040
'Thomas, no! You're too drunk 
to drive. Give me the keys.'

394
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,520
He held on to the keys and set off in the 
direction of the car park. He couldn't walk  

395
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,360
straight and his foot kept slipping off the 
pavement into the road. She followed him,  

396
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:14,000
but stayed some way behind; she was too angry, and 
just wanted to get back to her apartment alone.  

397
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,480
He shouted something over his shoulder about 
how he could drive better when he was drunk.

398
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,320
She stood with her arms crossed 
on the other side of the car park  

399
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,160
and watched him put the key into the lock. It 
took him three or four attempts. Then he was  

400
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,480
inside and she lost sight of him between two other 
cars. She heard him start the engine, though.

401
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,480
The explosion knocked her to the ground.  

402
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,840
She lay there for a moment, and then jumped 
to her feet. The Porsche was a ball of fire.

403
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,920
Darby ran towards it, screaming his name. Bits 
of the car were still falling all around her,  

404
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,520
and the heat stopped her thirty feet away. 
She screamed with her hands over her mouth.

405
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
A second explosion tore through 
the car and pushed her back.  

406
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,000
She fell and her head hit the side of a parked 
car hard. Everything went blank for a minute.

407
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,160
Then there were people 
everywhere, and voices shouting:

408
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,840
'Whose car is it? Call 911! 
Was there anyone in it?'

409
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,440
She was repeating the name Thomas. Someone put 
a cold cloth on her head. She heard the sound  

410
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,840
of the police and firemen coming, and then 
there were red and blue lights everywhere.

411
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,480
A black man was bending over her. 
'Are you all right, miss?' he asked.

412
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,960
'Thomas,' she said. 'Where's Thomas?'

413
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,440
'Miss, who's Thomas?' asked 
the man. 'Was he in that car?'

414
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,200
She nodded and then closed her eyes. She could 
hear men shouting in the distance. They were all  

415
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,160
over by the burning car. She sat up and was 
sick between her legs. Then she felt better.

416
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:23,840
She got up and walked away. She knew who the 
bomb had been for: her. And she knew why.

417
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,520
She had to hide; they were hunting 
her. Were they behind her even now?  

418
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,160
She wandered deep into the French Quarter, found a 
cheap hotel and paid for a room with her card. As  

419
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,520
soon as she was in the room, she locked the door 
and curled up on the bed with all the lights on.

420
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
***

421
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,240
Mrs Verheek answered the bedside phone.  

422
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,440
'It's for you, Gavin,' she called into 
the bathroom, where he was shaving.

423
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,920
He came and took the phone from her.  

424
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,440
'Hello,' he said angrily. Who could 
be calling this early in the morning?

425
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,840
'This is Darby Shaw. Do you know the name?'

426
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
'Yes. We share a friend.'

427
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,000
'Did you read the little theory I wrote?'

428
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,000
'Yes, the Pelican Brief, as we call it.'

429
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,240
'And who is "we"?'

430
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,960
Verheek sat up straight. She was not calling for 
a friendly chat. 'Why are you calling, Darby?'

431
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,840
'I need some answers, Mr Verheek. 
I'm frightened to death.'

432
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
'It's Gavin, OK?'

433
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
'OK, Gavin. Where's the brief?'

434
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,600
'Why? What's wrong?'

435
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,320
'I'll tell you in a minute. Just 
tell me what you did with the brief.'

436
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,960
'Well, I read it, and then I 
passed it on to someone else,  

437
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,160
who passed it on to Denton Voyles, who liked it.'

438
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,360
'Has anyone outside the FBI seen it?'

439
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,760
'I can't answer that.'

440
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,800
'Then I won't tell you what's happened to Thomas.'

441
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
'All right. Yes, it's been outside the FBI,  

442
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,520
but I don't know exactly where and I 
don't know how many people have read it.'

443
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,560
'He's dead, Gavin. He was murdered last night. 
Someone put a bomb in the car. I was lucky.'

444
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,640
Gavin was shocked. 'Where are you? Are you safe?'

445
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,480
'New Orleans. Who knows if I'm safe? They must 
be after me too. It was me they really wanted.'

446
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,160
'I'll have some men come and get you, Darby.  

447
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,880
You can't stay on the streets. Then I'll 
catch a plane and I'll be there by midday.'

448
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,520
'I don't think so. Thomas is 
dead because he talked to you.  

449
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,320
Why should I want to talk to you? Give me 
your number at work. I may call you later.'

450
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,880
'OK. But Darby, just tell 
me: did he feel any pain?'

451
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:10,880
There were tears in her voice. 'No, it was very 
quick.' Then she put the phone down. She could  

452
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,600
let herself cry now, because there wouldn't be 
time later. Crying could get her killed.
 
 
 
 
 

453
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,560
CHAPTER SEVEN

454
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,240
Keep Moving
 

455
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,520
It was nearly time for the 
President's daily meeting with Voyles.  

456
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,800
By now he was tired of the whole business; he 
just wanted to get his men into the Supreme Court.  

457
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,600
Coal was telling him something, 
but he wasn't really listening.  

458
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,040
Voyles and Coal hated each other so much now that 
Coal had to leave the office whenever Voyles came.  

459
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,760
They had nearly fought last time.  

460
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,880
It didn't matter to Coal whether he was 
in or out of the office; there were enough  

461
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,120
hidden microphones and cameras for him to 
listen and watch any conversation there.

462
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,120
The President felt better knowing that Coal was 
at least watching. He greeted Voyles warmly at  

463
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,440
the door and led him over to the sofa for 
a friendly chat. Voyles was not impressed.

464
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,920
'Denton,' the President said, 'I want to 
apologize for Coal's be-haviour last time.'

465
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,320
'He can be stupid, can't he?' Voyles 
said, knowing that Coal was listening.

466
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:42,240
'Yes. He's very clever, and works amazingly 
hard, but he goes too far sometimes. Anyway,  

467
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,840
that's all behind us now. I want you to 
tell me all about this Pelican Brief.  

468
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
How seriously are you taking it?'

469
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,200
Voyles tried not to smile. This was great - he 
had managed to get Coal and the President worried.  

470
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,520
'We are investigating all suspects, Mr President,' 
he replied. 'We have fourteen men on this one.'

471
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,880
'I don't have to tell you, 
Denton,' the President continued,  

472
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,840
'how much damage this theory could 
do if the press heard about it.'

473
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,560
'We won't tell the press, Mr President.'

474
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,120
'I know. All I'm saying is that I 
want you to pull back from this one.  

475
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,440
The theory is crazy anyway, and I could really 
get hurt. Do you understand what I'm saying?'

476
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,240
'Are you asking me not to 
investigate a suspect, Mr President?'

477
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,160
'I'm just saying that you must have 
better things to do with your men.  

478
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,680
The press is watching this investigation closely. 
You know how they are - they don't like me at all.  

479
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,840
So why don't you leave this one 
alone and chase the real suspects?'

480
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,160
'Is that what you're asking me to do?'

481
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,480
'I'm not asking you, Denton; I'm telling you to 
leave it alone for a couple of weeks. If you need  

482
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,200
to go back to it later, of course you must. But 
I'm still the boss around here, remember?' ***

483
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,520
Gavin stayed near Voyles's office until the 
secretary let him in. He couldn't believe it  

484
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,000
when Voyles and Lewis told him that they were 
no longer investigating the Pelican theory.

485
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,800
'My best friend is dead because of that 
brief,' he said. 'He was killed by a car bomb.  

486
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,840
Someone is worried about 
the brief, don't you think?'

487
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,840
'The brief has already been very 
valuable to us, Gavin,' Lewis said.

488
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,680
'Yeah, it let you play some games with 
the White House,' Gavin said bitterly.  

489
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,960
'But there's a girl out there running for 
her life. What am I going to tell her?' ***

490
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,440
Darby made sure she could not be followed 
in the crowds in the shopping district.  

491
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,720
She bought some new clothes and hid her hair 
under a hat. She went into the Sheraton Hotel  

492
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,680
and found a row of pay phones. First she called 
Mrs Chen, who lived in the apartment next to hers:  

493
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,440
no, she had not seen anything; yes, there had 
been a knock at her door early this morning.  

494
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,080
Then she called Gavin.

495
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,240
'Where are you?' he asked.

496
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:41,840
'Let me explain something. For now, I'm not going 
to tell you or anyone else where I am. Clear?'

497
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,480
'Yes, but don't go home.'

498
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,080
'I'm not a fool. They've already 
been there. What did Mr Voyles say?'

499
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,760
'I haven't been able to see him.'

500
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,920
'You've been at the office for four hours, 
Gavin. I expected you to do better.'

501
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,320
'Be patient, Darby.'

502
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,040
'Patience will get me killed. 
I've got to keep moving.'

503
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,360
She saw a face. He walked among the 
tourists at the hotel's front desk.  

504
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,320
He was trying to look as though he 
belonged here, but his eyes were searching.  

505
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,920
The face was long and thin, and he wore round 
glasses. He was a little over six feet tall.

506
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,280
'Gavin, listen to me,' she said.  

507
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,560
'I have to go. I can see a man I've 
seen before, about an hour ago.'

508
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,360
'OK. Take care, Darby, and call me again soon.'

509
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:40,960
'I'll try.'
 
 
 
 
 

510
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,000
CHAPTER EIGHT

511
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,800
Photos and Phone Calls
 

512
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:57,520
The photographer's name was Croft. He was parked 
on Pennsylvania Avenue in Grantham's Volvo,  

513
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:04,320
because it had a phone. The pay phone was easy 
to see, about fifty yards in front of the car.  

514
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,280
With his powerful camera he could 
almost read the names in the phone book.  

515
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,880
A large woman was using the phone at the moment.

516
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,640
At 12:20 the woman put the phone down 
and walked away. From nowhere a young  

517
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,720
man in a suit appeared and walked over to the 
phone. Croft felt sure that this was the man.  

518
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,920
He picked up his camera and looked through 
it. The man was pushing numbers on the phone  

519
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,720
and looked nervous. He kept looking this way 
and that. Croft took a couple of pictures.

520
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,360
The phone in the car went three times. Croft 
didn't pick it up. It was Grantham at the office,  

521
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,080
signalling that this was their man. Croft 
used a whole film on the first camera.  

522
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,840
When the man had finished talking on the 
phone, he walked straight towards the Volvo  

523
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,880
along the pavement. Beautiful. Croft took 
several more pictures with a second camera  

524
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,640
and stopped well before the man could 
possibly see inside the car. An easy job.

525
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
***

526
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,840
Grantham got plenty of excellent pictures from 
Croft. Garcia didn't look Spanish, despite the  

527
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,280
name he had chosen. He looked like thousands 
of other young lawyers up and down the country.

528
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,720
From Garcia he got nothing.  

529
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,880
It didn't matter. He let him talk about his wife 
and child, and how frightened he was. One day,  

530
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,080
and one day soon, Garcia would give 
him the information, whatever it was.

531
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,760
From Sarge he got a copy of a White House 
document naming Khamel as the probable killer  

532
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,640
of Rosenberg and Jensen. This was good. There 
was little in the office files about Khamel,  

533
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,040
and only two pictures, which looked like two 
different people, but he wrote it up into  

534
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,320
a story and they decided to use both pictures 
and the story on the front page the next day.

535
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,200
***

536
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,880
The phone was going. After twenty-four hours 
on the run, she had drunk a bottle of wine  

537
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,880
the night before and fallen asleep 
on her bed in the Marriott Hotel.  

538
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:32,800
But first she had cut off her long red hair and 
coloured it black; they would be expecting blonde.  

539
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,040
They would also be expecting her to run 
away, so despite her fears she stayed in New  

540
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,280
Orleans. They would be watching all the police 
stations, so she had stayed away from them.

541
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,760
The phone was still going. She picked 
it up and heard 'Darby? This is Gavin.'

542
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,840
Now she was awake. 'How did you find me?'

543
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,680
'We are the FBI. We have our ways.'

544
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,920
'Wait. Let me think. Of course, you can trace 
me when I use my cards to pay for things.  

545
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:18,240
How stupid of me! But if you can find me, they can 
find me too. They could be outside the door now.'

546
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,040
'Stay in small hotels, then, 
and pay with cash. Now, listen.  

547
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,080
I'm coming to New Orleans; 
it's Thomas's funeral tomorrow.

548
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,880
'I think we should meet tonight. 
You have to trust me, Darby.'

549
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,800
'What did Voyles say?'

550
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,520
Gavin hesitated. 'We're taking 
no action at this time.'

551
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,840
'That's lawyer talk, Gavin. What does it mean?'

552
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,000
'I don't want to talk on the 
phone. That's why we have to meet.'

553
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,480
'No. Tell me why Voyles is 
doing nothing about this.'

554
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,480
'I'm not sure why. Honestly.'

555
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,680
'What do you think, Gavin? Do you think 
Thomas was killed because of the brief?

556
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,440
'Yes.'

557
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:13,360
'Thanks. If Thomas was murdered because of the 
brief, then we know who killed him. And if we  

558
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:19,120
know who killed Thomas, then we know who 
killed Rosenberg and Jensen. Am I right?'

559
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,880
'Probably.'

560
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,400
'That's good enough - "probably" 
means "yes" when a lawyer says it.  

561
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,080
But the FBI is still doing 
nothing about my suspect.'

562
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,720
'Calm down, Darby. Let's meet tonight and 
talk about this. I could save your life.'

563
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,240
She carefully put the receiver of the phone under 
the pillow. She threw her things into a bag and  

564
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,720
left the room. She walked up two floors to the 
seventeenth, then took the lift down to the tenth.  

565
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,240
Then she walked down the 
stairs to the ground floor.  

566
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,680
She hid in the women's room for half 
an hour, and then left the hotel.

567
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,080
On Dumaine Street, in the French 
Quarter, she found an empty cafe  

568
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,520
with a phone at the back. She called Verheek.

569
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,160
'Where will you stay tonight?' she asked him.

570
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,840
'At the Hilton.'

571
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,240
'I'll call late tonight or early in the morning.'

572
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,600
'Can you get the Washington Post down 
there? You should read it today.'

573
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,600
'I can't wait. I'll speak to you later.'

574
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,320
She bought a Post and read it at another cafe.  

575
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:42,160
If the report was right, it fitted in 
with her theory. The local paper had  

576
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,400
a picture of Thomas on the second page, 
with a long story about the explosion.  

577
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,480
The police were looking for a white female whom 
several witnesses had seen there at the time.  

578
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:01,280
She looked slowly at the photo of Thomas. 
He was so handsome. Tears filled her eyes.

579
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,840
***

580
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:09,200
Alice Stark, Darby's best friend, got 
the key to the apartment from Mrs Chen  

581
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,120
and let herself in. She had been there plenty of 
times before, and everything looked all right.  

582
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,920
Nothing was out of place; the whole apartment 
was tidy. The kitchen smelled of stale food.

583
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,760
It was dark when she got there, but Darby 
had told her not to switch on the lights,  

584
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,840
and certainly not to open the curtains. 
She used a torch to see her way around.

585
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,840
She sat down at the computer and turned it on.  

586
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,880
She looked for the files Darby had 
mentioned, but they weren't there.  

587
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,640
By the light of the torch she looked in 
the boxes of diskettes; they were empty.

588
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,280
Alice returned the key to Mrs Chen and walked 
half a mile to where she had left her car.  

589
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,360
She met Darby as arranged in the restaurant, 
and she told her what she had discovered.  

590
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,600
Darby did not seem surprised, and 
refused to answer Alice's questions.

591
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,280
***

592
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,200
Verheek was angry. She had 
said she would call him.  

593
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,920
Now it was midnight and she still hadn't 
called. He could save her life if she called.  

594
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:32,400
He had to do something. He decided to visit a 
few student bars to find out if anyone knew her  

595
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,360
and had seen her recently. He got back 
to his room at three in the morning.  

596
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,840
There were no messages. She hadn't 
called. Was she still alive?
 
 
 
 
 

597
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,720
CHAPTER NINE

598
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,720
Searching for Darby
 

599
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,480
Another phone call from Garcia. The man still 
wouldn't talk. Why was he calling him before dawn  

600
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,520
on a Saturday? They'd had the same conversation 
every time - that he had to think about the safety  

601
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,920
of his wife and child, that he had seen something 
in his office - but there was never anything new.

602
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,040
Grantham had just gone back to 
sleep when the phone went again.

603
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,840
'Hello?' It was not Garcia this 
time; it was a female voice.  

604
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,200
'Is this Gray Grantham of the Washington Post? 
He must get an unlisted telephone number.

605
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,800
'It is. And who are you?'

606
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,200
'Are you still on the story 
about Rosenberg and Jensen?'

607
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,320
'Yes.'

608
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,880
'Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?'

609
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,960
'The Pelican Brief. No. What is it?'

610
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,240
'It contains a theory about who killed the 
judges. It was given to the FBI last Monday  

611
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,880
by a man called Thomas Callahan. Suddenly, on 
Wednesday, Callahan is killed by a car bomb.'

612
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,360
'How do you know all this?'

613
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,840
'I wrote the brief.'

614
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,880
He was wide awake now, 
listening hard. 'Where are you?'

615
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,800
'New Orleans.'

616
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,640
'Are you in danger?'

617
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,400
'I think so. But I'm OK for 
now. I'll call you again soon.  

618
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,360
See if you can find out anything about the brief.'

619
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,600
***

620
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:33,760
She came early to Thomas's funeral, and 
she would stay late. She found an empty  

621
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,320
room on the third floor of a student building 
that looked out over the university church.  

622
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:46,080
She sat with her face to the window and saw 
his parents and brother arrive. Students and  

623
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,800
staff came in twos and threes. She 
pressed a handkerchief to her eyes.

624
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,640
Then she saw him: it was the 
thin-faced man with glasses!  

625
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,840
He was wearing a coat and tie. He walked towards 
the church, looking carefully in every direction.  

626
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,560
First they kill him, then 
they come to his funeral.

627
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:18,000
Ten minutes later he came back out of the church. 
He looked sad, as if Thomas had been a friend.  

628
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,320
He put a cigarette in his mouth and walked 
past some parked cars and behind the church.  

629
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,600
Two minutes later, another man got out of one 
of the cars and followed him. The two of them  

630
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:36,320
reappeared after a minute, walking together now. 
Then Thin-face disappeared down the street while  

631
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,760
the other man, who was short, returned to his 
car and waited for the funeral service to finish.

632
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,440
***

633
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,800
The Cubans lowered the small rubber boat 
into the water from their ship. They heard  

634
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,680
the sound of the little engine as the man went 
west through the darkness towards the coast.

635
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,840
He would never use a commercial airline again; 
the photographs in Paris were embarrassing for a  

636
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:11,200
professional like himself, and his client was not 
pleased. Now he was going to have to do two jobs  

637
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:19,440
in a single month, which he had never done before. 
But this one would be easy - just a young woman.

638
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,840
In the hotel room in New Orleans, he spoke on 
the phone to a man calling himself Mr Snellen

639
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,880
'Tell me about her,' he said.

640
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,640
'There are two photos in the briefcase.'

641
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,880
Khamel opened the case and took out the photos.  

642
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:45,520
'I've got them. She's beautiful. It 
will almost be a pity to kill her.'

643
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,280
'Yes. But all that red hair has gone.  

644
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,840
We found some hair on the floor of a 
hotel room. She has coloured it black.'

645
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,840
'Where is she now?'

646
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,040
'We don't know. She has stopped 
using her cards to pay for things.  

647
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,040
She took out a lot of money from her bank, and 
since then she has disappeared. We think she's  

648
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,880
still in New Orleans, though. Someone was in 
her apartment last night. We just missed them.

649
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,640
'The bomb failed. We don't expect you to fail.'

650
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,280
***

651
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,760
Gavin was tired. He had spent 
two nights searching the bars,  

652
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,520
and he was too old for these late nights. 
When the phone went, he was still asleep.

653
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:33,600
'Gavin?'

654
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,840
'Darby, is that you?'

655
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,920
'Yes.'

656
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,360
'Why haven't you called before?'

657
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:45,920
'That doesn't matter now. You should know that 
they're here, in New Orleans. I've seen two  

658
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,840
of them - a thin-faced man and a short man. 
They were at the funeral service yesterday.'

659
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,440
'Where were you?'

660
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,360
'Watching. How long will you be in town?'

661
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,560
'Until we meet. When will that be?'

662
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,240
'I don't know yet. I'll call again soon.'

663
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,080
The phone went dead. Gavin picked it up 
and threw it across his hotel room.
 
 
 
 
 

664
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,960
CHAPTER TEN

665
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,640
Another Body
 

666
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,640
The first thing she did when she woke up on 
Sunday morning was listen. Was the door opening?  

667
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:32,240
Was the floor outside making a noise? When she 
was sure she was safe, she thought about Thomas.  

668
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,440
She remembered their times together; 
she remembered how he loved her.  

669
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,800
It was a surprise for him, the first time he 
had really been in love. And she loved him too.

670
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:52,320
After a few minutes of thinking about 
Thomas, she thought about them. She  

671
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:59,520
had to think like them too, to stay alive. 
Where would they be today? Where could she  

672
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:06,720
go? Was it time to move hotels again? Yes. 
Did they know that she was now a blonde?

673
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:16,400
She felt hungry. She had hardly eaten for days. 
This hotel didn't do breakfast on Sundays,  

674
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,800
so she had to go out. She left by 
the back door, through the kitchen.

675
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,720
He saw her when she reached Burgundy Street.  

676
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:31,200
The hair was different, but she couldn't 
change her long legs. He started to follow her.

677
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
***

678
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,760
Khamel was practising his 
English when the phone went.  

679
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:42,640
It was Sneller. 'She's here,' he said. 
'One of our men saw her this morning.  

680
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,440
He chased her, but she noticed him 
and lost him in the football crowds.'

681
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,880
Khamel said, 'So how am I supposed to find her, 
if your men can't tell me where she's staying?'

682
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,720
'It might not matter,' Sneller said. 
'There's an FBI lawyer in town.  

683
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,120
The fool has been visiting bars 
and asking questions about her,  

684
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:11,840
spreading his name around. He's asked anyone who 
knows her to contact him at his hotel, the Hilton.  

685
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,920
My men will continue trying to find the 
girl, and you can stay close to him. He's in

686
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:25,840
'Room 1909. He was Callahan's 
best friend. She might call him.'

687
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,000
***

688
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,760
Gavin was lying on his bed, watching 
TV. It was eleven at night. He would  

689
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,760
wait until twelve and then try to sleep. He had 
decided to go home tomorrow if she didn't call.  

690
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:45,040
He couldn't find her. It wasn't his fault: 
even taxi-drivers got lost in this city.

691
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,080
When the phone went, he switched 
the TV off and picked it up.

692
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,840
'It's me, Gavin,' she said.

693
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,480
'You're alive,' he said.

694
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,800
'Yes, but I was followed 
today. It was the short man.'

695
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,600
'Did he follow you from somewhere?'

696
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,160
No, he just happened to see me in the streets.'

697
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:14,640
'Listen, Darby, I can't wait here any more. 
I've got a job to go back to. I want to leave  

698
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,160
New Orleans tomorrow, and I want you to come 
with me. I'll have three men guarding you,  

699
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,520
and you'll be safe. You can tell us all you 
know, and then the FBI will finish the job.'

700
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,840
Darby thought for a minute. 'All right.  

701
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,560
Behind your hotel there's a 
shopping area called Riverwalk.'

702
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,160
'I know it.'

703
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:43,600
'Good. Find a shop called Frenchmen's Bend and 
be there, at the back of the shop, at midday  

704
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:49,840
tomorrow. I don't know what you look like, 
so wear a black shirt and carry a newspaper.'

705
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,600
'This is silly.'

706
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:59,120
'No, it's not. I've had to learn fast how to stay 
alive. Believe me, this is the way to do it.'

707
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,000
'OK, you're the boss.'

708
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,400
'That's right. Only you and I will leave the city.  

709
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,160
I don't want anyone else knowing 
about this. Do you understand?'

710
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:11,680
'All right.'

711
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,600
'How tall are you?'

712
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,720
'About five feet, ten inches.'

713
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,560
'And how much to you weigh?'

714
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:25,200
'About a hundred kilos. I usually lie about 
it. I'm going to start doing some exercise.'

715
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,520
'I'll see you tomorrow, Gavin.'

716
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,280
'I hope so.'

717
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,960
He put the phone down and smiled. 
'Great! At last!' he said out loud.  

718
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,000
He went into the bathroom for a shower.

719
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:48,160
When he came out, the room was dark. Dark? 
But he had left the light on, hadn't he?  

720
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,520
He started to walk over to the light switch.

721
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,480
The first blow caught him in the 
throat. He fell to his knees,  

722
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:03,600
which made the second blow easy. It landed like a 
rock on the back of his neck, and Gavin was dead.

723
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,680
Khamel switched on a light. He lifted 
up the body and put it on the bed.  

724
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,200
He turned the sound on the 
television up loud, opened his bag  

725
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:21,440
and took out a cheap gun. He held it to 
the right side of Gavin's head and fired.  

726
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,840
Then he carefully put the gun in Gavin's 
right hand and curled the fingers around it.  

727
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,480
It wouldn't take a doctor very long 
to find out how Gavin had really died,  

728
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:39,600
but Khamel didn't need very long -by the evening 
of the next day he would be out of the country.

729
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,280
He opened up the receiver of the telephone 
and took out the little microphone.  

730
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,480
He pulled the recorder out from under the bed.  

731
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,200
Finally, he checked that the cupboard 
where he had waited was clean.  

732
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:01,520
Then he left the room. No one had seen 
him enter, and no one saw him leave.
 
 
 
 
 

733
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,280
CHAPTER ELEVEN

734
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:14,800
Riverwalk
 

735
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,240
Grantham couldn't find out anything about 
the brief. Even Sarge hadn't heard of it.  

736
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:28,640
When Darby's call came through to his office 
on Monday morning he had nothing to tell her.

737
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:36,400
'It doesn't matter. I'll tell you everything 
soon, I think. I don't want to die without  

738
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,800
telling the world what I know. They're 
following me here in New Orleans.'

739
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,080
'Who?'

740
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,040
'The same people who killed Rosenberg and Jensen. 
If you've read the report about Callahan's death,  

741
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:57,520
you know about the white female the police want to 
talk to. That's me. My name is Darby Shaw. Thomas  

742
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:05,920
Callahan was my teacher and my lover. I wrote the 
brief, gave it to him, he passed it on to the FBI,  

743
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,840
who took it to the White House, and you know 
what happened next. Are you recording this?'

744
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,600
'I'm writing it down,' Grantham said.

745
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,640
'I'm going to leave New Orleans. I'll call you 
from somewhere else tomorrow. Can you get a copy  

746
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,880
of the list of people who gave large amounts 
of money to help the President get elected?'

747
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,400
'Easy; it's public information. 
I'll have it by the time you call.

748
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,960
'Do you have a copy of the brief?'

749
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,840
'No, but I remember it all.'

750
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,560
'And you know who's doing the killing?'

751
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,920
'Yes, and as soon as I tell you, 
your life will be in danger too.'

752
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,240
'Tell me now.'

753
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:51,120
'Not so fast. I'll call you tomorrow.'

754
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:59,200
After the phone conversation Grantham went in 
to see his boss, Smith Keen. He explained the  

755
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:06,880
situation to him. Keen was excited, but said, 
'Even if she tells us what's in the brief,  

756
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,200
we can't print the story; we'll 
need an independent witness.'

757
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:17,120
'I'm working on it,' Grantham 
said, and told him about Garcia.

758
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,280
'This is going to be big,' Keen 
said. 'This is going to put the

759
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,440
'Post right back up at the top.'

760
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
***

761
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,840
She arrived on Riverwalk at eleven. She sat 
in a restaurant and nervously drank a coffee  

762
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:41,280
while watching the people pass. She didn't see 
Thin-face or Shorty or anyone else she recognized.  

763
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:50,640
At 11:45 she got up and walked towards Frenchmen's 
Bend. If he wasn't there by 12:15 she would leave.  

764
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:58,480
But he was there, wearing the black shirt and 
carrying a newspaper. He looked nervous too.  

765
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:04,880
She liked that. At exactly twelve o'clock he 
walked into the shop and went to the back.

766
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,640
She came up behind him and said, 'Gavin.'

767
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:15,120
He had practised Gavin's voice for hours, 
but wasn't sure he had it exactly right.  

768
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:22,880
He turned around quickly and said, 'Darby.' 
Then he pretended to cough. She wouldn't  

769
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,640
expect the same voice from someone with 
a cold. 'Let's get out of here,' he said.

770
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:36,080
'Follow me,' she said. Darby took his hand and 
led him out of the shop and towards the river.

771
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,080
'Have you seen them?' he asked.

772
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,040
'No, but they're around somewhere.'

773
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,200
'Where are we going?'

774
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,280
'Just come with me.'

775
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,320
'You're walking too fast, Darby. 
It will look strange to people.  

776
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,320
Let me make a phone call. I can have men 
here in ten minutes and then we'll be safe.'  

777
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,720
He was pleased with himself; 
he sounded just right.

778
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:12,480
'No,' she said, but she slowed down. They joined 
the queue for the riverboat Bayou Queen. 'The  

779
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:18,240
boat will take us to where I've parked a car,' 
she explained. 'Then we get out of here fast.'

780
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,640
Khamel was uncomfortable; he was wearing a 
great many un-derclothes, so that he would  

781
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:32,640
look as fat as Verheek. But he could wait an hour 
until they were out of the city. And then . . .

782
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,600
The man with the gun pushed his way 
through the queue. He had killed before,  

783
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:44,640
but never in such a public place. The queue was 
moving, but he was getting through it. The man  

784
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,080
and the woman were just about to step on to the 
boat when he reached them. He pulled the gun  

785
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:57,120
out of his pocket, held it to the man's head 
and fired. He disappeared through the crowd.

786
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,840
Gavin was falling to the ground. Darby 
screamed and moved back in horror.  

787
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:10,800
'He's got a gun!' a woman shouted, and pointed 
at Gavin, who was on his hands and knees,  

788
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:18,160
with a small gun in his right hand. Blood poured 
from his nose and chin, and formed a small pool  

789
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,040
under his face. His head was hanging 
down until it nearly touched the ground.  

790
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,840
He was speaking some words in a 
language Darby didn't recognize.

791
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,840
'He's Egyptian,' someone in the crowd said.

792
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:39,120
He fell forward, dropping the gun into the 
water, and died in a widening pool of blood.  

793
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,920
Darby walked away as the crowd 
moved forwards to see the dead man,  

794
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,400
and two policemen started 
to push their way through.

795
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,080
***

796
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:57,520
She left Riverwalk after dark. She had bought 
new clothes and wore a new coat as well.  

797
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,080
She waved at a taxi.

798
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,280
'How much to take me to Baton Rouge?' she asked.

799
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,880
'That's a long way,' the driver said. 
'You should go by bus or train.'

800
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,160
'How much?' she asked again.

801
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,680
'One hundred and fifty dollars,' the 
man said, after a moment's thought.

802
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,400
'Here's two hundred,' she 
said. 'Get me there fast.'  

803
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,600
Thomas had talked to her about his friend Gavin 
Verheek. She knew he wasn't an Egyptian.

CHAPTER TWELVE

805
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,640
Darby Explains
 

806
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,800
Voyles sent East down to New Orleans to 
learn the truth about Verheek's death.  

807
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,600
Lewis brought the news to his office.

808
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:53,440
'Denton, when are we going to start 
taking this Pelican Brief seriously?'  

809
01:14:54,080 --> 01:15:00,800
he asked. 'People keep dying because of it. We'd 
better investigate it. It must be Mattiece.'

810
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:08,400
'I know,' Voyles said. 'We'll send down a team 
of men, but I don't want the fool in the White  

811
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:14,880
House or Coal to hear that we're investigating 
it - I want to surprise them. When the President  

812
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,920
told me to leave the brief alone, I was 
carrying a small recorder in my pocket.  

813
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:27,200
I've got every word, loud and clear. 
If we find that the brief is accurate,  

814
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:33,280
the press will love us, and we can let them know 
that the President told us not to investigate it.'

815
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,240
'That'll be the end of him 
and Coal,' Lewis said happily.

816
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,320
'I know. He'll have no chance in the 
election next year. We've got him.'

817
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:52,160
They smiled at each other. 'But what about 
Mattiece?' Lewis said. 'If he hadn't killed  

818
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:57,200
all -those people, we wouldn't have thought 
the brief was right. He must be crazy.'

819
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:05,200
'There are rumours that he is,' Voyles 
replied. 'I've spoken to the CIA. They  

820
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:11,600
had men in New Orleans. They don't know where 
Mattiece is. He's probably not in this country.  

821
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:18,800
He owns houses all over the world. We'll need 
their help to get him. They were following the  

822
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,240
girl too, but they lost her in Chicago 
airport. She could be anywhere by now.'

823
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:31,240
'She could be dead,' Lewis said. 'Mattiece's 
men are following her as well.' ***

824
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,240
Grantham traced two old photographs 
of her - one from her high school,  

825
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:44,400
one from her first university. He pinned 
them up beside his desk. She was beautiful.

826
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,360
She called him as she had promised. He had read 
about the killing of a lawyer in New Orleans,  

827
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,960
and she told him the true story. She also 
told him about the other killing, which had  

828
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:03,840
not appeared in the newspapers. Then she said, 
'Can you come to New York tomorrow, Grantham?'

829
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:10,560
'Of course. It'll only take a few 
hours. But please call me Gray.'  

830
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,520
He looked at the photographs of her.

831
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,120
'I'll ring tomorrow morning 
to tell you where to meet me.  

832
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,520
And tomorrow I'll tell you who 
killed Rosenberg and Jensen.'

833
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,080
'Do you know who did it?'

834
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:31,920
'I know who paid for the killings. I know his 
name. I know his business and his politics.'

835
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,320
'And you'll tell me tomorrow.'

836
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,400
'If I'm still alive.'

837
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:44,880
A pause. 'Perhaps we should 
talk immediately,' he said. ***

838
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,240
They met in her room in the 
St Moritz Hotel in New York.  

839
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,600
They chatted for a while, 
getting to know each other.  

840
01:17:52,880 --> 01:18:00,160
It was the first normal conversation Darby had had 
for a week, and it was a great pleasure. They sent  

841
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:06,560
out for some food, and after they had eaten he 
switched on a recorder and she told him a story:

842
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,040
'For centuries, the Mississippi River 
has been carrying mud down to the sea.  

843
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,800
Where the river meets the sea, marshes 
have spread out over an enormous area.  

844
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,320
These marshes are the home for a great many rare 
and unusual animals, birds, reptiles and fish.'

845
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,400
'Then oil was discovered there in 1930. The 
oil companies began to destroy the marshes.  

846
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:40,720
Where the river mud had been creating new land, 
now the sea was able to wash the land away.  

847
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,280
Since the discovery of oil, tens of thousands 
of acres of Louisiana marshland has gone.  

848
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,920
Every fourteen minutes, another 
acre disappears under water.'

849
01:18:52,760 --> 01:19:01,440
'In 1979 an oil company owned by Victor Mattiece 
found a very rich oilfield, worth thousands of  

850
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:08,560
millions of dollars. Mattiece wanted it all. 
He knew that others would buy the surrounding  

851
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,680
land if they heard there was a major oilfield 
there, so he pretended that nothing had happened.  

852
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,960
He stopped work there, and waited. Slowly 
and patiently, as the years passed,  

853
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,600
he bought the surrounding land. He 
created new companies, lots of them,  

854
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,840
so that no one would know that he was the 
buyer. At last he was ready to begin drilling.'

855
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:42,720
'Then a small environmental group called Green 
Rescue made a legal request to the courts to stop  

856
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:50,880
the drilling. The request was un-expected, because 
for so long Louisiana had profited from the oil  

857
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:57,840
companies. The court in Lafayette agreed that all 
drilling should stop until the case was settled.'

858
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:06,240
'Mattiece knew that this could take 
years. He was dangerously angry. He spent  

859
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:12,560
weeks with his lawyers, making plans. But every 
move they made was disallowed by the courts.'

860
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:19,520
'People were sympathetic to Green Rescue's 
case. A lot of wildlife was at risk.  

861
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:25,600
The marshland where Mattiece wanted to 
drill was home to a great many rare and  

862
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:32,400
beautiful sea birds, including brown pelicans. 
There were very few of these pelicans left.  

863
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,680
When people thought about the case, 
they thought about the pelicans.'

864
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:45,840
'At last the case came to trial. Green 
Rescue lost, and that was not surprising:  

865
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,440
Mattiece had spent millions of dollars 
and had the best lawyers in the country.  

866
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,920
But the judge still forbade the drilling to start.  

867
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:03,120
The pelican was a protected bird under Louisiana 
law, and Green Rescue weren't finished yet:  

868
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,920
they would take the case all 
the way to the Supreme Court.'

869
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,840
'How long would it take to reach 
the Supreme Court?' Gray asked.

870
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,040
'Between three and five years.'

871
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,720
'By then Rosenberg would be dead anyway.'

872
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:27,840
'Yes, but it might be a Democratic President 
who was choosing the judge to take his place;  

873
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,880
Mattiece couldn't take that chance. And 
Jensen was always soft on environmental cases.  

874
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:42,640
Mattiece needed two Republican judges in there, 
both of whom were supporters of big business.'

875
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,360
'Can you prove that all the 
companies involved in buying  

876
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,400
the land in Louisiana are owned by Mattiece?'

877
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:57,600
'It's in the brief, and I've written it all 
out for you. And then there's the photograph.'

878
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,200
'Tell me.'

879
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:06,800
'Seven years ago, before the President was 
elected, he was in New Orleans getting money  

880
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:13,520
for the Republicans. Although Mattiece stays 
out of the public eye, he was there that day,  

881
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:19,440
and some clever photographer got a picture 
of him shaking hands with the President.  

882
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,920
Both of them are smiling, and they 
look like old friends. It's beautiful.'

883
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:34,080
'I can easily find a copy of that. This whole 
thing is beautiful. It's the biggest story since  

884
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:41,600
Watergate - maybe even bigger.' Gray turned 
off the recorder and sat back in his chair.  

885
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,080
They were silent for a short while. Then he asked,  

886
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:52,320
'Do you think Mattiece himself 
chose Rosenberg and Jensen?'

887
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:58,960
'No, I'm sure he had advice from a lawyer. 
He's got lawyers all over the country.'

888
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,320
Gray sat up again. 'Does 
he have any in Washington?'

889
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:13,120
'Yes, there are two firms there who do some work 
for him - Brim, Stearns and Kidlow is one of them;  

890
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:20,560
the other is White and Blazevich, a very old, 
Republican firm. But why are you interested?'

891
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:29,040
Gray quickly told her about Garcia. 'Maybe 
he works at one of those two firms,' he said.  

892
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,680
'That would make it much easier to find him.'

893
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:38,720
They were both tired. She asked him to 
sleep on the sofa in her room that night,  

894
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:42,080
so that she could get a good night's 
sleep for the first time for days.  

895
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,160
He agreed. She was so beautiful that 
he would do anything to be close her;  

896
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,160
he would even sleep on a five-foot sofa.
 
 
 
 
 

897
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,440
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

898
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,360
Washington
 

899
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,360
Darby worked in the library all 
morning and rang Grantham at midday.  

900
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:11,920
She had been reading lists of the members at both 
the Washington law firms that worked for Mattiece;  

901
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,000
there was no one called Garcia 
on either list, of course.  

902
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:23,200
There were four Spanish names among the 190 
lawyers who worked for Brim, Stearns and Kidlow,  

903
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:29,920
but none among the 412 who 
worked for White and Blazevich.

904
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,320
She rang Gray with this information from 
a pay phone in a cafe on Sixth Avenue.  

905
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:40,960
As she turned to leave she saw the short man 
who had been looking for her in New Orleans.  

906
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:50,560
He was here, in New York, walking the streets. 
He didn't look inside the cafe, however. For the  

907
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:58,400
moment she was safe, but it was time to leave New 
York. Two hours later, she was at Newark airport.

908
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:07,120
When this was all over - if she was still alive - 
where could she go? She thought of the thousands  

909
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:14,240
of islands in the Caribbean; no one could find 
her there. She no longer wanted to practise law.  

910
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:20,080
All she wanted to do was reach her twenty-fifth 
birthday, and maybe her thirtieth too.

911
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,800
***

912
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,120
Croft spent a week waiting outside the 
offices of Brim, Stearns and Kidlow.  

913
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,200
There were plenty of lawyers 
who looked as young as Garcia,  

914
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:39,840
and they all dressed similarly in dark suits, 
but there was no Garcia. He was sure of it.

915
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,400
***

916
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,040
Some of the people employed by the White 
House didn't work at the White House;  

917
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:50,160
some were so secret that 
their offices were elsewhere  

918
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:56,720
and very few people knew of their existence. 
Matthew Barr was one of these shadowy people.

919
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:04,400
He was riding in the back of the car with Coal. 
Coal was silent while Barr read the Pelican Brief.  

920
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:12,000
When he had finished, Barr said, 'I'd 
love to know how much of this is true.'

921
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,520
'So would we,' Coal said.

922
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,560
'What did the President say about it?'

923
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:25,280
'He agreed that the theory was implausible, 
so he asked Voyles not to investigate it.'

924
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,960
'Really? And what if it's true?'

925
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,600
'Then the President has got problems. Me too.'

926
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,400
They rode in silence for a 
while and watched the traffic.  

927
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,280
Then Coal said, 'We need to 
know if the brief is true.'

928
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:50,160
'If people are dying, it's true. Why 
else did Callahan and Verheek die?'

929
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,600
There was no other reason, and Coal 
knew it. 'I want you to do something.'

930
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,520
'Find the girl?'

931
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,840
'No, go to Mattiece and talk to him.'

932
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,800
'It won't be easy. He isn't 
exactly listed in the phone book.'

933
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:17,920
'You can do it. You've done more difficult things 
for us in the past. You've done worse for us too.'

934
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,600
'And you think Victor will trust 
me and tell me his secrets?'

935
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:29,440
'Why not? You're not a policeman. You can help 
him; you can tell him that the press will have  

936
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:35,600
the story soon and so it would be a good idea 
for him to disappear. Then he'll trust you.'

937
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,560
'What if it's true? What will you do next?'

938
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,880
'The first thing will be for the President to 
appoint two nature-lovers to the Supreme Court;  

939
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:54,000
that will show people that we really care 
for the environment. Then, at the same time,  

940
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,840
he will get the FBI to start an official 
investigation into Victor Mattiece.'

941
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,720
Barr was smiling with admiration. 
'What about the photograph?' he asked.

942
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:14,400
'Easy. It's seven years old. We say that 
in those days Mattiece was a good citizen,  

943
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,720
not a madman as he is now. Anyway,  

944
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:24,560
by Sunday I'll tell you where he is. I've 
got a man working on it. Be ready to leave.'

945
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:27,520
***

946
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:34,000
Darby called Gray at 9:30 the next morning 
at his office. 'I'm here,' she said.

947
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,080
'Where are you calling from?' Gray asked.

948
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,520
'I'm staying at the Tabard Inn. I 
saw an old friend in New York and  

949
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,920
decided it was time to leave. I hope 
I didn't bring any of them with me.  

950
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:55,120
I bought two plane tickets with my card, for them 
to follow, but I paid cash for the one I really  

951
01:28:55,120 --> 01:29:02,960
used. Even then I changed planes four times. 
If they follow me here, they must be magicians.  

952
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,520
If I see any of them here, I 
think I'll just surrender.'

953
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,840
'When do we meet?'

954
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:16,880
'Meet me in the restaurant here at nine 
tonight. But, Gray, don't use your own car;  

955
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,680
hire another one. And be ready 
to stay away from your home  

956
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,640
and office for a few days. I've booked 
you a room at the Marbury Hotel.'

957
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,760
'Surely the office is safe, Darby.'

958
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:36,480
'I'm not in the mood to argue. If you're going 
to be difficult, Gray, I'll simply disappear.  

959
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:44,240
I'm sure I'll live longer out of the country, 
anyway. I've got to go now. You be careful.'

960
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,720
***

961
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,800
The Marbury was close to where 
his boss, Smith Keen, lived,  

962
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:56,960
and there were some things they had to talk 
about. The next morning he rang Keen from his  

963
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:04,080
room and they arranged to meet outside the front 
of the hotel in fifteen minutes. While they drove  

964
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:09,680
around in Keen's car they discussed various ways 
in which they could use the information they had.  

965
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,560
They agreed that finding Garcia 
was the key to the whole story;  

966
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:22,480
without Garcia they had little more than 
rumour and an unlikely theory. They hoped  

967
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,880
that Garcia's information really was as 
important as they were guessing it was.

968
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,440
She had told him to stay off the 
streets and to eat in his room.  

969
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,680
After Keen had left him near his hotel, 
he bought a sandwich and a cup of coffee,  

970
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:42,960
and returned to his room. An Asian cleaning 
woman was working outside his room.  

971
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:51,600
'Did you forget something, sir?' she asked. 
Gray looked at her. 'What do you mean?'

972
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,880
'You just left your room, 
sir, and now you're back.'

973
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,520
'I left two hours ago.'

974
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:05,040
'No, sir. A man left your room ten minutes ago.' 
She hesitated and looked at his face closely.  

975
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,240
'But now I see that it was another man, sir.'

976
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:16,000
He walked quickly to the stairs and ran 
all the way down to the ground floor.  

977
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,040
What was in his room? Nothing important 
- just some clothes. Nothing about Darby.  

978
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:26,880
Her phone number at the 
Tabard Inn was in his pocket.

979
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,640
He had to find her, and quick.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

981
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,480
Curtis D. Morgan
 

982
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:46,000
Darby spent the day in the Georgetown law library, 
reading and taking notes about the members of the  

983
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:52,720
Washington law firms that Mattiece used. It 
was boring work, and her mind often wandered.

984
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,360
She thought a lot about Thomas.

985
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,280
***

986
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,480
Matthew Barr went to New 
Orleans, where he met a lawyer  

987
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,560
who told him to fly to a certain 
hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

988
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,640
He wouldn't tell Barr what was going 
to happen there, but when Barr arrived  

989
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,320
he found a room waiting for him.  

990
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:18,960
A note at the front desk of the hotel said he 
would receive a phone call in the early morning.

991
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:25,840
He called Fletcher Coal at home 
at ten and told him the news.

992
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,440
***

993
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:35,520
She stepped on the note when she opened her door. 
It said: Darby, I'm in the garden. It's urgent.  

994
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:43,120
Gray. She locked the door, went downstairs, 
through the restaurant and out into the garden.  

995
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,160
She found him sitting at a small 
table, half hidden behind a wall.

996
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:57,120
'Why are you here?' she demanded in a whisper. He 
told her what had happened, and what he'd done for  

997
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:03,120
the rest of the day. He had spent it riding 
round the city in a dozen different taxis,  

998
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:10,080
waiting for dark. Then he came to the Tabard. 
He was certain that no one had followed him.

999
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:17,040
She listened. She watched the restaurant and the 
entrance to the garden, and heard every word.

1000
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,040
'I have no idea how anyone 
could find my room,' he said.

1001
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,600
'Did you tell anyone your room number?'  

1002
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:32,560
He thought for a second. 'Only Smith Keen, 
but he didn't have time to tell anyone else.'

1003
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,320
'Where were you when you told him?'

1004
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:36,960
'In his car.'

1005
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:43,040
She shook her head slowly. 'I told 
you not to tell anyone, didn't I?  

1006
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:52,080
You think this is all a game. It's not, Gray, it's 
real. This isn't just a great newspaper story,  

1007
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,760
which is going to make Gray 
Grantham famous and win him prizes.  

1008
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:04,720
I've seen people die. God knows how many times 
I've been close to death myself. These people  

1009
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:10,800
are dangerous, and they're professionals. 
They know about you and the Washington Post.  

1010
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,920
They've probably been listening to you since 
you wrote the first story about this matter.  

1011
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:22,960
They'll have microphones hidden in your 
apartment, your car and your office. It  

1012
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:28,640
looks as though they've got microphones in Keen's 
car as well. Do you understand what I'm saying?  

1013
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,080
Last night at dinner we tried to 
pretend we were two normal people  

1014
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:39,840
getting to know each other. But 
that wasn't real: this is real.'

1015
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:46,640
She was right, of course. He felt like a 
schoolchild in front of an angry teacher.

1016
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:54,400
'You can stay here tonight,' she said, 'and 
tomorrow I'll find you another small hotel.'

1017
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,480
***

1018
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,160
After breakfast the next 
morning she got on the phone.  

1019
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,720
She rang the Georgetown law school and 
pretended to be from White and Blazevich.  

1020
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:11,040
She said that their computers were not 
working, and that for the sake of her records  

1021
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,200
she needed to know which students had 
worked for White and Blazevich last summer.  

1022
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,400
She waited, with her hand over 
the mouthpiece of the phone,  

1023
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,080
and looked at Gray. The secretary from 
the law school came back on the phone.  

1024
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:35,040
'Seven of them,' Darby said. 'Thank you.' 
She wrote down their names. 'And do you have  

1025
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:41,840
their addresses, please? We need them for our 
records.' She wrote down this information too.

1026
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:46,160
'That was brilliant,' Gray 
said when she had finished.  

1027
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:52,800
'Now all we need to do is find as many of 
these students as we can, show them your  

1028
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:58,320
photograph of Garcia, and hope that one of them 
recognizes him and can tell us his real name.'

1029
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,680
'Why couldn't we just wait outside 
the firm's building until he came out,  

1030
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,160
and then follow him? That's what Croft 
was doing at Brim, Stearns and Kidlow.'

1031
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:14,800
'Too risky. It seems likely that White and 
Blazevich were involved in some way in the  

1032
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:21,520
killings. There are people who know my face, 
and we know they're looking for you too. What  

1033
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,400
if they're guarding White and Blazevich? 
They would see us, and then we'd be dead.'

1034
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:35,680
They hired a car and began to try to find the 
seven students. Gray found two of them at home and  

1035
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:41,600
Darby spoke to another as he was leaving a class 
at the school; none of them recognized Garcia.  

1036
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:50,480
They met at 10:45 and compared notes. At eleven, 
students were leaving their classes and she found  

1037
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:57,200
another of the seven students, but he too knew 
nothing. A fifth was working in the library;  

1038
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:03,120
she didn't like answering Darby's questions, 
but she admitted that she didn't know Garcia.

1039
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:12,960
Only two left - Edward Linney and Judith Wilson. 
Wilson was expected back at her apartment at one  

1040
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:20,160
o'clock, so Gray spent the rest of the morning 
trying to find Linney, but he was not at home  

1041
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:25,840
and no one at the school seemed to know where 
he was. They hadn't seen him for several weeks.

1042
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:33,840
They drove together to Judith Wilson's apartment. 
She wasn't there at one, so they waited.  

1043
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:41,120
She arrived an hour later. Gray jumped 
out of the car, ran up to her and caught  

1044
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:47,840
her at her front door. He showed her the 
photograph, and Darby saw her shake her head.

1045
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:54,400
'Linney had better be good,' he said as he 
got back into the car. 'But where is he?'

1046
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:01,840
'I hope we find him today,' she said, 'because 
tomorrow I leave the country if we don't.'

1047
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:08,480
Back at the law school, one of his fellow 
students at last told them where he was:  

1048
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:16,400
in a private hospital. He was well on the way 
to becoming an alcoholic, and his parents had  

1049
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:22,880
ordered him to spend some time there. The nurse 
at the front desk of the hospital told Gray that  

1050
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:30,240
Mr Linney was in Room 22, but refused to let 
him see him. Gray asked to see the manager,  

1051
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,320
and while the nurse was fetching him 
Gray whispered to Darby, 'Room 22.'

1052
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,040
She left the waiting-room and 
boldly walked to his room.  

1053
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,640
She knocked and went in. The young 
man looked surprised to see her.

1054
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:54,240
'I'm Sara Jacobs,' she said. 'I work for the 
Washington Post. May I ask you a question?'

1055
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,840
'Yes, but how did you get in?'

1056
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,920
'I just walked in. You worked at White 
and Blazevich last summer, didn't you?  

1057
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,120
Do you recognize this man?' 
She showed him the photograph.

1058
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:17,440
'Yes, he's . . . what's his name? I can't 
remember. He works in the oil and gas department.'

1059
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:19,760
Darby held her breath.

1060
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:27,440
Linney closed his eyes and thought. 'Morgan. 
Yes, that's it. His surname is Morgan,  

1061
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,920
but I can't remember his first 
name. What's this all about?'

1062
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,800
'I'll tell you later,' Darby said, and left.

1063
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,720
Gray was waiting for her back in the car.  

1064
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:46,400
She didn't say anything but immediately looked 
at the notes she had taken in the law library.  

1065
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:55,200
There he was. 'Garcia is Curtis D. 
Morgan,' she said. 'Let's go.'
 
 
 
 
 

1066
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,480
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1067
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,400
Two Appointments
 

1068
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:11,040
After five hours at sea in the small, fast boat, 
every bone in Matthew Barr's body was aching,  

1069
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:16,720
and he was wet and cold. His only 
companion had been a man called Larry,  

1070
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,760
who was extremely tall and looked very strong.  

1071
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:26,080
Larry had met him in Fort Lauderdale and 
had not said a word to him since then.

1072
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:34,320
They landed in a country Barr believed was the 
Bahamas. A car took them to a small airfield,  

1073
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:38,960
where a Lear jet was waiting. The 
flight took about forty-five minutes.  

1074
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:45,520
Another car took them to a large house. 
Barr had no idea where they were.

1075
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,840
Barr was met by a man who called himself Emil,  

1076
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,520
who led him round the outside 
of the house to a sunroom.

1077
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,840
'I'm afraid you must take off your 
shoes,' Emil said with a polite smile,  

1078
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,840
'and be careful not to step on the towels.'

1079
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:09,680
Inside, Barr saw that towels were lying on 
the floor of the sun- room, making paths  

1080
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:16,320
around the room. A door on the other side of 
the room opened, and Victor Mattiece came in.

1081
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:25,040
Barr stared. Mattiece was an extraordinary 
sight. He was extremely thin, and had  

1082
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:30,800
long grey hair and a beard. He wore 
only a pair of black sports shorts.  

1083
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,280
His toenails were yellow and very 
long. He looked completely crazy.

1084
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:47,040
'Sit over there,' he said, pointing at 
a chair. 'Don't step on the towels.'

1085
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:56,880
When Barr was seated, Mattiece asked, 'What 
do you want?' He was staring out of a window.

1086
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:01,280
'The President sent me,' Barr began.

1087
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:06,320
'He did not. Fletcher Coal sent you.'

1088
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,840
'All right. We need to know whether the 
Pelican Brief is true. Have you read it?'

1089
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,520
'Have you?'

1090
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,040
'Yes.'

1091
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,800
'Does Mr Coal believe it to be true?'

1092
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:29,200
'I don't know. He's very worried. That's 
why I'm here, Mr Mattiece. We have to know.'

1093
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,000
'What if it is true?'

1094
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,880
'Then we have problems.'

1095
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,760
Mattiece turned away from the 
window, looked at Barr and said,  

1096
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:49,360
'Do you know what I think? I think Coal is the 
problem. He let too many people see the brief.'

1097
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:56,960
Barr could not believe what he was hearing. 
The man who had ordered so many deaths was  

1098
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:05,280
blaming someone else for the situation. 'Is it 
true, Mr Mattiece? That's all I want to know.'

1099
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,480
Behind Barr, a door opened without a sound.  

1100
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:16,880
Larry, in his socks and avoiding the 
towels, stepped silently into the room.

1101
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:24,480
Mattiece walked over to the door and 
said softly, 'Of course it's true.'  

1102
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,800
He left the sun-room and went into the garden.

1103
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,400
Now what? Barr thought.

1104
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:40,000
Larry put the rope round Barr's neck, and Barr did 
not hear or feel anything until it was too late.  

1105
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:46,560
Mattiece did not want blood on the 
floor, so Larry simply broke his neck.

1106
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,960
***

1107
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,440
They reached the building where White and 
Blazevich's offices were before five o'clock.  

1108
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,320
She was wearing a dress, and 
Gray said she looked just right.  

1109
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,560
She could tell that he liked the way she looked,  

1110
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:08,560
and she found to her surprise that it didn't 
make her angry, just a little sad about Thomas.

1111
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,880
She walked up to the secretary at 
the desk, who said, 'Can I help you?'

1112
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:23,760
'Yes, I have an appointment at five o'clock 
with Curtis Morgan. My name is Dorothy Blythe.'

1113
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,000
The secretary's mouth fell 
open and she said nothing.

1114
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:32,560
Darby's heart stopped. 'Is something the matter?'

1115
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:39,680
'Can you wait a moment?' the secretary said. 
She got up and disappeared into another room.

1116
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:48,000
Run, Darby's mind was telling her, run! 
There's something wrong here. But before  

1117
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,520
she had time to do anything, the 
secretary returned with a man.

1118
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:59,600
'Good afternoon,' he said. 'I'm Jarreld 
Schwabe, one of the partners of the firm.  

1119
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,600
You say you have an appointment 
with Curtis Morgan?'

1120
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,880
'Yes. Is there a problem?'

1121
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
'There's nothing in his appointment book.'

1122
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,800
'Well, that's your fault, not mine.'

1123
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,840
'And what was the meeting about?'

1124
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:23,360
She felt weak. 'I don't see why I have to 
tell you that. Why can't I see Mr Morgan?'

1125
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,840
'Because he's dead.'

1126
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,680
She was in shock. 'Dead?'

1127
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:35,760
'Yes,' Schwabe said. 'He was mugged in the street.  

1128
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,880
I'm sorry. I can see this 
has been a shock for you.'

1129
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:47,200
She decided to act really upset. She 
didn't want them to ask any more questions;  

1130
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,960
she wanted them to think that 
she was just a weak young woman.  

1131
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:58,960
'I'm sorry,' she said, 'I think I'd better 
go. I'll phone again for another appointment.'

1132
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,400
Schwabe led her to the lift himself.

1133
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:11,120
Edwin Sneller knew that he and his men had been 
wasting their time in New York; the place was  

1134
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:18,960
just too big. Then at last she moved some money 
from her bank in New Orleans to Grantham's bank  

1135
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:25,840
in Washington. Sneller's client owned the bank, 
so he received any information he asked for.  

1136
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:31,600
That meant that she was in Washington, and that 
she and the reporter were working together.  

1137
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:40,720
He had two men with him, and he had asked for 
more. They had to do the job quickly. But he  

1138
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:47,680
felt less confident without Khamel. The girl had 
escaped so far, and she could be hiding anywhere.  

1139
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:54,400
He would start with the Washington Post building: 
Grantham had to come back there some time.

1140
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,040
***

1141
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:02,480
Gray found Curtis D. Morgan's address in the 
suburbs, and they drove out together to the house.  

1142
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,840
Mrs Morgan's father, however, 
refused to let them in to see her.  

1143
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,800
Gray left his business card, so that 
she could call him if she wanted to.  

1144
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:18,960
He told her father that Morgan had spoken 
to him three times just before he died.

1145
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:25,120
'Is that the end of Garcia?' 
Darby asked as they drove away.

1146
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:30,880
'We'll see tomorrow,' he said. 
'How do you feel at the moment?  

1147
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:37,680
Do you feel safe? I'll be glad to sleep in your 
room tonight, just like I did in New York.'

1148
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:44,000
'But I don't have a sofa here,' 
she said. 'Where would you sleep?'  

1149
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:51,040
She was smiling and this was a good 
sign. But then she remembered Callahan.  

1150
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:58,880
'I'm not ready, Gray. I'm sorry.' She rested 
her head on his shoulder while he drove the car.  

1151
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:03,840
'I'm still frightened to death,' she said.
 
 
 
 
 

1152
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,160
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1153
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,240
Morgan's Story
 

1154
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,440
Beverly Morgan called Gray at 
four o'clock the next morning.  

1155
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,560
'My father would be angry with 
me if he knew I was calling,'  

1156
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:27,360
she said. 'The reporters were horrible to us after 
Curtis was killed. But I need to talk to someone.'

1157
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:34,240
She asked him how he knew her husband, and Gray 
explained about his phone calls, and the murders  

1158
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:40,960
of Rosenberg and Jensen. He spoke to her patiently 
for a long time, until he won her confidence.

1159
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,640
'What do you think he knew?' she asked.

1160
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:50,800
'I have no idea. If he had written 
something down on paper, where would it be?'

1161
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:57,040
'In our lock-box in the bank. But 
that's where all his legal papers were,  

1162
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:02,720
so I've already looked in there. I did find 
another key in his desk, though, last Saturday.'

1163
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,440
Gray held his breath. 'A key to another lock-box?'

1164
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:14,960
'Yes, a box at First Columbia Bank. That's 
odd, because we've never used that bank.  

1165
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,680
I wasn't in a hurry to go to 
the bank and look in the box,  

1166
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:25,680
because I already had all his legal papers. Maybe 
it was even something I wouldn't want to see.'

1167
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,880
'Would you like me to look in 
the box for you?' Gray asked.

1168
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,400
'I hoped you would say that. Yes, please.'

1169
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,880
'I'll come round and get the key now'

1170
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:38,960
***

1171
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:44,320
He and Darby drove to the bank the 
next morning. Mrs Morgan had given  

1172
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:49,680
Gray written permission to open the lock-box, 
so the clerk let them into the strong-room.  

1173
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:55,840
It didn't take them long to empty the 
box: all it held was a thin envelope.

1174
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:00,320
Darby opened the envelope when 
they were back in the car.  

1175
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:09,440
Inside was a document written by Morgan and 
properly signed by a legal witness. The document  

1176
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:18,480
started: 'Since you are reading this, I am 
probably dead.' It was a powerful first sentence.

1177
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:24,800
In the document Morgan described 
who he was and where he worked.  

1178
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,520
He said that he often worked for one of the 
firm's clients who was called Victor Mattiece.  

1179
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:41,200
The partner in charge of Mr Mattiece was F. Sims 
Wakefield. Morgan explained the Louisiana case  

1180
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:47,280
and how important it was to Mr Mattiece. It 
was important to White and Blazevich too,  

1181
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,840
since Mattiece had promised them a 
share of the profits from the oil.

1182
01:50:53,600 --> 01:51:01,600
On or about 28 September, the document continued, 
Morgan had been in Wakefield's office collecting  

1183
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:09,760
some files. When he returned to his own office, he 
found that by mistake he had picked up a note from  

1184
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:17,360
Wakefield's desk together with the files. A copy 
of the note was joined on to Morgan's document.  

1185
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:28,880
The note was dated 28 September and was from 
Marty Velmano, another partner. It read: Sims:  

1186
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:35,440
Tell our client that the Court will be 
easier on him if Rosenberg is retired.  

1187
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:44,000
The second retirement is a bit unusual 
- it is Jensen (who, as you know,  

1188
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:54,240
has those other problems). The note amazed and 
frightened Morgan. Realizing its importance,  

1189
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:58,960
he made a copy of it and returned the 
original to the bottom of the pile of files.

1190
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:08,400
Ten minutes later Wakefield came into his office, 
looking pale and worried. They found the note  

1191
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:12,560
under the files and Wakefield 
asked Morgan if he had read it;  

1192
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:20,640
Morgan said no. Wakefield looked at 
him very closely, but seemed satisfied.

1193
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:25,760
That night he left the 
papers on his desk very tidy.  

1194
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:33,280
The next morning he could see that someone 
had searched his desk. He began to see  

1195
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:40,480
Velmano in Wakefield's office more than usual. 
Wakefield stopped him working for Mattiece.

1196
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:49,280
Then Rosenberg and Jensen were killed. He was 
sure that Mattiece had ordered the killings.  

1197
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:57,040
He thought that people were following him. 
He had decided to hide his copy of the note  

1198
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:03,760
together with this document in a bank, in 
case he was killed. He was very frightened.

1199
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,360
That was the end of the document.

1200
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:09,760
***

1201
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:16,320
The thin-faced man watched the car come fast 
round the corner and park illegally outside the  

1202
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:22,720
Post building. The man and the woman jumped out 
of the car and ran past him into the building.

1203
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,800
He had a gun inside his jacket, 
but it all happened too fast.

1204
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:30,400
***

1205
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:34,320
Smith Keen and the Post's lawyer, Vincent Litsky,  

1206
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:42,240
read through Morgan's document. When they 
had finished, Gray said, 'Well, gentlemen,  

1207
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:47,200
there's your independent witness. 
Can we print Darby's story now?'

1208
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,880
Keen and Litsky looked at each other.  

1209
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,840
Keen left the office for a few minutes 
to speak to the newspaper's owner.  

1210
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:04,960
When he came back he said, 'OK, Gray. We do the 
story. How long will it take you to write it?'

1211
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:09,040
'I already know the shape of it,' Gray replied.  

1212
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:14,320
'I only have to write the details. 
It should take me about two hours.'

1213
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:20,720
'It's eleven o'clock now,' Keen 
said. 'Try to finish it by three.  

1214
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,160
Litsky needs time to read it before we print.'

1215
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:32,880
With Darby's help, he finished the story on time. 
Keen and Litsky read it and made some changes.  

1216
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,560
Darby was watching something out of the window.

1217
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,680
'When I've rewritten the story,' Gray said,  

1218
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:46,000
when Keen and Litsky had finished, 
'I have to make some phone calls.'

1219
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:50,560
'We'll be back at half past three,' Keen said.

1220
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:57,920
'They're outside,' Darby said softly, 
when Keen and Litsky had left the room.

1221
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,200
'Who are?'

1222
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:06,640
'I was watching a man standing on the corner. 
He looks innocent enough; he's just standing  

1223
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:13,280
there drinking coffee from a cup. But he's been 
there a long time - I saw him earlier as well.  

1224
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:20,640
And just now, when you were talking, I saw the 
short man who chased me last week come up to  

1225
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:26,080
the coffee-drinker. They talked for a minute 
and then the short man disappeared again.  

1226
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:31,840
They're just waiting for us 
to leave the building.'
 
 
 
 
 

1227
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,560
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

1228
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,960
Time to Trust Someone
 

1229
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,240
The first phone call was to a 
friend of Grantham at the FBI.

1230
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,440
'Phil, this is Gray Grantham. 
I've got the recorder on.'

1231
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,120
'That sounds serious. Go on.'

1232
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:58,480
'We're going to print a story tomorrow about the 
Rosenberg and Jensen killings. We're going to name  

1233
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:04,000
Victor Mattiece as the man behind the killings, 
and also two of his lawyers here in Washington.  

1234
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:10,560
We'll connect this story with the killing 
of Verheek in New Orleans. We believe the  

1235
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:16,320
FBI knew about Mattiece early on but refused to 
investigate at the request of the White House.  

1236
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:24,560
We want to give you the chance to comment.' 
There was silence. 'Phil, are you there?'

1237
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,160
'Yes, I think so.'

1238
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:29,920
'Any comment?'

1239
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,880
'I'm sure we will have a comment, 
but I'll have to call you back.'

1240
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,840
'OK. I'll look forward to it.'

1241
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:43,680
In fact it was Voyles himself who 
called back, about ten minutes later.  

1242
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,000
He demanded to speak to Smith Keen.

1243
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:52,000
'What are you doing, Smith?' he said. 
'We're still investigating Mattiece.  

1244
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,240
It's too early to be sure. What have you got?'

1245
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:59,920
'Does the name Darby Shaw mean 
anything to you?' Keen asked.

1246
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,040
'Yes.'

1247
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:06,720
'We have the Pelican Brief, Denton, and 
I'm sitting here looking at Darby Shaw.'

1248
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,160
'I was afraid she was dead.'

1249
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:15,440
'No, she's not. And she and Gray Grantham have 
an independent witness to support the brief.  

1250
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,520
It's a big story, Denton.'

1251
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,480
'We need to meet. I'll come 
round in twenty minutes.'

1252
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:23,840
'OK.'

1253
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:30,880
Keen put the phone down and smiled. 
He was amused at the idea of the great  

1254
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,560
F. Denton Voyles coming round 
to his office for a meeting.

1255
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:40,400
The next phone call Gray made was 
to Fletcher Coal in the White House.  

1256
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:46,320
Coal agreed that Mattiece had given large amounts 
of money towards the President's election,  

1257
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,240
but denied that Mattiece and the 
President were close friends.  

1258
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:54,320
He had to admit that he was 
familiar with the Pelican Brief.  

1259
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:59,840
When Gray asked why there had not been 
an immediate investigation of Mattiece,  

1260
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:05,840
Coal angrily denied that the White House had 
tried to slow down such an investigation.

1261
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:14,960
Then Voyles arrived with K. O. Lewis. Keen took 
him into his own office and gave him a copy of the  

1262
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:21,920
story to read while Gray made the third phone 
call. He rang White and Blazevich and was put  

1263
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:28,320
through to Marty Velmano. For the third time he 
explained that he was recording the conversation.

1264
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,640
'Mr Velmano,' Gray said, 'we're 
printing a story in the morning which  

1265
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:40,000
names your client Victor Mattiece as the man 
behind thekillings of Rosenberg and Jensen.'

1266
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:45,520
'Good!' said Velmano. 'We'll take you to court.  

1267
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:50,960
By the time we're finished, Mr 
Mattiece will own the Washington Post.'

1268
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:57,920
'Mr Velmano, we have a copy of the 
Pelican Brief. Have you heard of it?'

1269
01:58:59,280 --> 01:58:59,840
Silence.

1270
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:06,880
'We also have a copy of a note you 
sent to Sims Wakefield on 28 September.  

1271
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,600
In the note you suggested 
that your client's position  

1272
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,840
would be a lot better without Rosenberg 
and Jensen on the Supreme Court.'

1273
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:17,920
Silence.

1274
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:21,600
'Mr Velmano, are you there?'

1275
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:23,360
'Yes.'

1276
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:29,840
'We wanted to give you the chance to 
comment. Do you have any comment?'

1277
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:34,640
'You're going to destroy me,' Velmano said.

1278
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,280
***

1279
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:43,840
Voyles and Lewis entered the room with Smith 
Keen. Keen introduced them to Darby and Gray.  

1280
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:49,760
Voyles smiled at Darby and said, 'So 
you're the one who started all this.'

1281
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:54,080
'No, sir,' she said, 'I think it was Mattiece.'

1282
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:02,560
They sat around a table. Voyles had a piece of 
paper. He said, 'I'm going to read you something.  

1283
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,560
This is official, and you 
can use it in your paper.  

1284
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,760
Anything else Lewis or I say is unofficial, 
and you can't use it. Is that clear?'

1285
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,560
Keen and Grantham said yes.

1286
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:25,760
'All right,' Voyles said. 'We received a copy of 
the Pelican Brief two weeks ago and showed it to  

1287
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:32,720
the White House on the same day. It was personally 
delivered by K. O. Lewis to Fletcher Coal.  

1288
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:39,840
Eric East was also present at the meeting. 
We thought it was worth investigation,  

1289
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:46,160
but nothing happened for six days, until 
Gavin Verheek was murdered in New Orleans.  

1290
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:53,840
The FBI began a full investigation into Victor 
Mattiece, involving over four hundred men.  

1291
02:00:55,600 --> 02:01:00,560
We believe Victor Mattiece to be the 
main suspect in the murders of Rosenberg,  

1292
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:05,440
Jensen, Thomas Callahan and Verheek, 
and we are trying to find him.'

1293
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:12,160
'Did the White House interfere with your 
investigation of Mattiece?' Grantham asked.

1294
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:19,120
'This is now unofficial,' Voyles 
said. 'You can't use it. OK?'

1295
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,840
'OK.'

1296
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:26,560
'Yes, the President asked me 
not to investigate Mattiece.  

1297
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:32,800
He said it could be embarrassing to the 
Government. I recorded the conversation.'

1298
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:38,400
They could hardly believe what they 
were hearing. He recorded the President!

1299
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:46,800
'I will not allow anyone to hear that recording,' 
Voyles continued, 'unless the President denies  

1300
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:53,440
what I have just told you. Anyway, will 
you use the official story I've given you?  

1301
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:57,840
Will you put Coal's name there on the 
front page along with everyone else?'

1302
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:03,840
'Yes, I think he belongs there,' Keen said.

1303
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:11,200
'Good,' said Voyles. 'Can you give me some 
early copies of the newspaper tomorrow morning?  

1304
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,520
I want to take them round to 
him myself and watch his face.'

1305
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:21,920
'He'll take the blame,' Keen said. 
'It will be the end of his career,  

1306
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,640
but he'll make the President look innocent.'

1307
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,680
'Yes, I think you're right,' said Voyles.  

1308
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:35,920
'Now, I'd like to speak to Miss Shaw alone, 
please, if that's all right with her.'

1309
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:40,320
'OK,' she said, 'but Grantham stays.'

1310
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:41,920
'All right.'

1311
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:49,120
When everyone else had left the room, Voyles 
asked, 'What are you going to do next?'

1312
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:54,160
'First tell me who killed 
Gavin Verheek,' she said.

1313
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:59,520
'It was Khamel. And Khamel was the one who  

1314
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,320
was shot in the head as you were 
holding his hand by the river.'

1315
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,320
'Who killed him?'

1316
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:12,320
'We think it was someone from the CIA. We know the 
CIA were investigating Mattiece in a small way.  

1317
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:18,400
In his oil business Mattiece had connections 
with some unfriendly Arab countries,  

1318
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:24,320
so the CIA were already keeping an 
eye on him. When they saw a copy of  

1319
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:28,720
the Pelican Brief they sent a few men 
down to New Orleans to look after you.'

1320
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:36,960
Darby got up and went to the window. It was dark 
outside now. 'They didn't do a very good job,  

1321
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:42,720
then,' she said. 'There are men out there now 
who have been following me for a week or more.  

1322
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:49,840
One of them chased me in New Orleans, so 
I don't think he's CIA. Mattiece is so  

1323
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:56,320
crazy that he'll go on trying to kill me even 
after he goes to prison - if you catch him.'

1324
02:03:56,320 --> 02:04:00,960
'We can help,' Voyles said. 'We 
can get you out of the country.'

1325
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:10,240
It was time to trust someone. She took 
a deep breath. 'All right,' she said.

1326
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:13,280
'I'll go and make the arrangements,' Voyles said.

1327
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:20,080
Alone in the room, Darby walked into Gray's 
arms. 'It's going to be all right now,'  

1328
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:24,240
he said, holding her. 'It's over. You're safe.'

1329
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:30,400
'I'm going alone, Gray,' she said. 
'I'll call you when I'm ready.'
 
 
 
 
 

1330
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:35,440
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

1331
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,840
Away From It All
 

1332
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:45,040
By 11 p.m. only four lawyers remained 
in the offices of White and Blazevich.  

1333
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:53,520
They were Velmano, Sims Wakefield, Jarreld 
Schwabe and a retired partner named Frank Cortz.

1334
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:59,520
Cortz finished a phone conversation 
with one of Victor Mattiece's staff.  

1335
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:10,800
'That was Strider,' he said. 'They're in Cairo, 
in some hotel. Mattiece won't talk to us and,  

1336
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:18,000
of course, he isn't coming back over here. 
Strider says he's behaving very strangely.  

1337
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:24,800
They've told the boys with the guns to 
leave town immediately. The chase is over.'

1338
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:30,240
'So what are we supposed to do?' asked Wakefield.

1339
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:36,560
'We're on our own,' said Cortz. 
'Mattiece isn't going to help us.'

1340
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:41,760
There was silence around the table 
as they all looked into the future.  

1341
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:48,240
Then Velmano said, 'Grantham 
only mentioned me and Sims.  

1342
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:56,560
You two may be OK. And I've got enough money saved 
to spend the rest of my life hiding in Europe.'

1343
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:05,440
'It's all right for you,' Wakefield said. 'I 
can't hide. I've got a wife and six children.'

1344
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:12,320
'I think you should go home and tell 
your wife what to expect,' Velmano said.

1345
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:19,360
'I can't do that,' Wakefield 
said. He got up and left the room.

1346
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,440
A minute later they heard the sound 
of a single gunshot from his office.

1347
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:29,040
***

1348
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:34,400
After eight days in the sun of the Virgin 
Islands her skin was brown enough and her  

1349
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:40,320
hair was returning to its natural colour. 
She walked miles up and down the beaches  

1350
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:46,000
and ate nothing except fish and fruit. 
She slept a lot the first few days.

1351
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:51,920
She looked at her wrist and then remembered 
that her watch was in a bag somewhere.  

1352
02:06:53,040 --> 02:07:01,280
She didn't need it here. She woke with the sun and 
went to bed after dark. But now she was waiting,  

1353
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,680
so she had looked at her wrist.

1354
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:10,480
It was almost dark when the taxi stopped 
at the end of the small road. He got out,  

1355
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:18,080
paid the driver and looked at the lights as the 
car disappeared back up the road. He had one bag.  

1356
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:24,720
He could see a light from the house between the 
trees at the edge of the beach, and he walked  

1357
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:33,680
towards it. He didn't know what to expect. He knew 
how he felt about her, but did she feel the same?

1358
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:38,800
She was waiting at the back of 
the house, looking out to sea,  

1359
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:46,240
with a drink in her hand. She smiled at him, 
put down her drink and let him come to her.

1360
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:52,480
They kissed for a long minute. 
'You're late,' she said.

1361
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:59,440
'This is not the easiest place to find,' 
Gray said. 'Even when you have directions.'

1362
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:06,480
'I know,' she said. 'That's the idea. 
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?'

1363
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,920
'It is. You are too.'

1364
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,520
'Let's go for a walk,' she said.

1365
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:20,000
He changed into a pair of shorts and they 
walked together on the beach, hand in hand.

1366
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:23,520
'You left early,' she said.

1367
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:31,040
'I got tired of it. I've written a story a day 
since the big one, and they kept wanting more.  

1368
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:37,360
I was working eighteen hours a 
day. Yesterday I said goodbye.'

1369
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,680
'I haven't seen a paper for days,' she said.

1370
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:49,920
'Coal's finished. The President will be OK. 
I don't think he did anything really bad;  

1371
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:56,000
he's just stupid. He won't get reelected, 
though. You read about Wakefield?'

1372
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:59,920
'Yes, that was in the last paper I saw.'

1373
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:05,680
'They've got Schwabe. They want 
Velmano too, but he's disappeared.  

1374
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,200
Of course Mattiece is in deep trouble, 
and they're after four of his men too.'

1375
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:18,560
They walked in silence along the beach. She put 
her arm round his waist and he pulled her closer.  

1376
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:27,120
'I've missed you,' she said softly. 
He breathed deeply, but said nothing.  

1377
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,840
'How long will you stay?' she asked.

1378
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:39,440
'I don't know. A couple of weeks. 
Maybe a year. It depends on you.'

1379
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:46,160
'Let's take it a month at a time. OK, Gray?'

1380
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:49,440
'Perfect.'
 
 

1381
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:49,972
- THE END -
