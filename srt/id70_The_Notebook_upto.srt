1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,480
Miracles

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,580
Who am I? And how, I wonder, will this story
end?

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,869
The sun has come up and I am sitting by a
window that is foggy with the breath of a

4
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:29,910
life gone by. I’m a sight this morning:
two shirts, heavy pants, a scarf wrapped twice

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,370
around my neck and tucked into a thick sweater
knitted by my daughter thirty birthdays ago.

6
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,890
The thermostat in my room is set as high as
it will go, and a smaller space heater sits

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:53,649
directly behind me. It clicks and groans and
spews hot air like a fairy-tale dragon, and

8
00:00:53,649 --> 00:01:01,390
still my body shivers with a cold that will
never go away, a cold that has been eighty

9
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:09,280
years in the making. Eighty years, I think
sometimes, and despite my own acceptance of

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,510
my age, it still amazes me that I haven’t
been warm since George Bush was president.

11
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,750
I wonder if this is how it is for everyone
my age.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:31,320
My life? It isn’t easy to explain. It has
not been the rip-roaring spectacular I fancied

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,530
it would be, but neither have I burrowed around
with the gophers. I suppose it has most resembled

14
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:47,869
a blue-chip stock: fairly stable, more ups
than downs, and gradually trending upward

15
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:55,960
over time. A good buy, a lucky buy, and I’ve
learned that not everyone can say this about

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:06,070
his life. But do not be misled. I am nothing
special; of this I am sure. I am a common

17
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:14,290
man with common thoughts, and I’ve led a
common life. There are no monuments dedicated

18
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:23,830
to me and my name will soon be forgotten,
but I’ve loved another with all my heart

19
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:31,459
and soul, and to me, this has always been
enough.

20
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:39,080
The romantics would call this a love story,
the cynics would call it a tragedy. In my

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,580
mind it’s a little bit of both, and no matter
how you choose to view it in the end, it does

22
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,330
not change the fact that it involves a great
deal of my life and the path I’ve chosen

23
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:02,170
to follow. I have no complaints about my path
and the places it has taken me; enough complaints

24
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,430
to fill a circus tent about other things,
maybe, but the path I’ve chosen has always

25
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:15,069
been the right one, and I wouldn’t have
had it any other way.

26
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:23,650
Time, unfortunately, doesn’t make it easy
to stay on course. The path is straight as

27
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:31,160
ever, but now it is strewn with the rocks
and gravel that accumulate over a lifetime.

28
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,151
Until three years ago it would have been easy
to ignore, but it’s impossible now. There

29
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:46,080
is a sickness rolling through my body; I’m
neither strong nor healthy, and my days are

30
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:55,569
spent like an old party balloon: listless,
spongy, and growing softer over time.

31
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:04,750
I cough, and through squinted eyes I check
my watch. I realize it is time to go. I stand

32
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,780
from my seat by the window and shuffle across
the room, stopping at the desk to pick up

33
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,780
the notebook I have read a hundred times.
I do not glance through it. Instead I slip

34
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:27,350
it beneath my arm and continue on my way to
the place I must go.

35
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:35,530
I walk on tiled floors, white in color and
speckled with gray. Like my hair and the hair

36
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,319
of most people here, though I’m the only
one in the hallway this morning. They are

37
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:48,631
in their rooms, alone except for television,
but they, like me, are used to it. A person

38
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:54,320
can get used to anything, if given enough
time.

39
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,310
I hear the muffled sounds of crying in the
distance and know exactly who is making those

40
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:08,820
sounds. Then the nurses see me and we smile
at each other and exchange greetings. They

41
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,470
are my friends and we talk often, but I am
sure they wonder about me and the things that

42
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:22,699
I go through every day. I listen as they begin
to whisper among themselves as I pass. “There

43
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:30,120
he goes again,” I hear, “I hope it turns
out well.” But they say nothing directly

44
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,760
to me about it. I’m sure they think it would
hurt me to talk about it so early in the morning,

45
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,670
and knowing myself as I do, I think they’re
probably right.

46
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:49,970
A minute later, I reach the room. The door
has been propped open for me, as it usually

47
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:56,450
is. There are two others in the room, and
they too smile at me as I enter. “Good morning,”

48
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:03,330
they say with cheery voices, and I take a
moment to ask about the kids and the schools

49
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:10,889
and upcoming vacations. We talk above the
crying for a minute or so. They do not seem

50
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:18,650
to notice; they have become numb to it, but
then again, so have I.

51
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,599
Afterward I sit in the chair that has come
to be shaped like me. They are finishing up

52
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:32,440
now; her clothes are on, but still she is
crying. It will become quieter after they

53
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:40,479
leave, I know. The excitement of the morning
always upsets her, and today is no exception.

54
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,390
Finally the shade is opened and the nurses
walk out. Both of them touch me and smile

55
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,130
as they walk by. I wonder what this means.

56
00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:01,250
I sit for just a second and stare at her,
but she doesn’t return the look. I understand,

57
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:11,000
for she doesn’t know who I am. I’m a stranger
to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head

58
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,319
and pray silently for the strength I know
I will need. I have always been a firm believer

59
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,450
in God and the power of prayer, though to
be honest, my faith has made for a list of

60
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,960
questions I definitely want answered after
I’m gone.

61
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:40,139
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket
comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for

62
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,750
a moment while I open the notebook. It takes
two licks on my gnarled finger to get the

63
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:54,849
well-worn cover open to the first page. Then
I put the magnifier in place.

64
00:07:54,849 --> 00:08:01,430
There is always a moment right before I begin
to read the story when my mind churns, and

65
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:08,990
I wonder, Will it happen today? I don’t
know, for I never know beforehand, and deep

66
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:16,949
down it really doesn’t matter. It’s the
possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee,

67
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:24,370
a sort of wager on my part. And though you
may call me a dreamer or fool or any other

68
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,280
thing, I believe that anything is possible.

69
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,479
I realize the odds, and science, are against
me. But science is not the total answer; this

70
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:46,589
I know, this I have learned in my lifetime.
And that leaves me with the belief that miracles,

71
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:54,380
no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable,
are real and can occur without regard to the

72
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:04,290
natural order of things. So once again, just
as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook

73
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,010
aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope
that the miracle that has come to dominate

74
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,010
my life will once again prevail.

75
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:23,410
And maybe, just maybe, it will.

76
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,079
Ghosts

77
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:39,149
It was early October 1946, and Noah Calhoun
watched the fading sun sink lower from the

78
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:48,890
wraparound porch of his plantation-style home.
He liked to sit here in the evenings, especially

79
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:56,030
after working hard all day, and let his thoughts
wander without conscious direction. It was

80
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:02,709
how he relaxed, a routine he’d learned from
his father.

81
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:09,480
He especially liked to look at the trees and
their reflections in the river. North Carolina

82
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:20,360
trees are beautiful in deep autumn: greens,
yellows, reds, oranges, every shade in between.

83
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:30,610
Their dazzling colors glow with the sun, and
for the hundredth time, Noah Calhoun wondered

84
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:37,380
if the original owners of the house had spent
their evenings thinking the same things.

85
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:48,860
The house was built in 1772, making it one
of the oldest, as well as largest, homes in

86
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,700
New Bern. Originally it was the main house
on a working plantation, and he had bought

87
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,490
it right after the war ended and had spent
the last eleven months and a small fortune

88
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,279
repairing it. The reporter from the Raleigh
paper had done an article on it a few weeks

89
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:14,529
ago and said it was one of the finest restorations
he’d ever seen. At least the house was.

90
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:20,110
The remaining property was another story,
and that was where he’d spent most of the

91
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,339
day.

92
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:29,420
The home sat on twelve acres adjacent to Brices
Creek, and he’d worked on the wooden fence

93
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,190
that lined the other three sides of the property,
checking for dry rot or termites, replacing

94
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:43,390
posts when he had to. He still had more work
to do on it, especially on the west side,

95
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,240
and as he’d put the tools away earlier he’d
made a mental note to call and have some more

96
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,230
lumber delivered. He’d gone into the house,
drunk a glass of sweet tea, then showered.

97
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:05,820
He always showered at the end of the day,
the water washing away both dirt and fatigue.

98
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Afterward he’d combed his hair back, put
on some faded jeans and a long-sleeved blue

99
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:24,250
shirt, poured himself another glass of sweet
tea, and gone to the porch, where he now sat,

100
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,709
where he sat every day at this time.

101
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:32,780
He stretched his arms above his head, then
out to the sides, rolling his shoulders as

102
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:39,380
he completed the routine. He felt good and
clean now, fresh. His muscles were tired and

103
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,000
he knew he’d be a little sore tomorrow,
but he was pleased that he had accomplished

104
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,250
most of what he had wanted to do.

105
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,019
Noah reached for his guitar, remembering his
father as he did so, thinking how much he

106
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:59,160
missed him. He strummed once, adjusted the
tension on two strings, then strummed again.

107
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:07,329
This time it sounded about right, and he began
to play. Soft music, quiet music. He hummed

108
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:13,040
for a little while at first, then began to
sing as night came down around him. He played

109
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,530
and sang until the sun was gone and the sky
was black.

110
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,440
It was a little after seven when he quit,
and he settled back into his chair and began

111
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,950
to rock. By habit, he looked upward and saw
Orion and the Big Dipper, Gemini and the Pole

112
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,900
Star, twinkling in the autumn sky.

113
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,160
He started to run the numbers in his head,
then stopped. He knew he’d spent almost

114
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,600
his entire savings on the house and would
have to find a job again soon, but he pushed

115
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,339
the thought away and decided to enjoy the
remaining months of restoration without worrying

116
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,130
about it. It would work out for him, he knew;
it always did. Besides, thinking about money

117
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,120
usually bored him. Early on, he’d learned
to enjoy simple things, things that couldn’t

118
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,959
be bought, and he had a hard time understanding
people who felt otherwise. It was another

119
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
trait he got from his father.

120
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,250
Clem, his hound dog, came up to him then and
nuzzled his hand before lying down at his

121
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,260
feet. “Hey, girl, how’re you doing?”
he asked as he patted her head, and she whined

122
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,860
softly, her soft round eyes peering upward.
A car accident had taken her leg, but she

123
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,250
still moved well enough and kept him company
on quiet nights like these.

124
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:39,720
He was thirty-one now, not too old, but old
enough to be lonely. He hadn’t dated since

125
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,750
he’d been back here, hadn’t met anyone
who remotely interested him. It was his own

126
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,560
fault, he knew. There was something that kept
a distance between him and any woman who started

127
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,480
to get close, something he wasn’t sure he
could change even if he tried. And sometimes

128
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,970
in the moments right before sleep came, he
wondered if he was destined to be alone forever.

129
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:13,390
The evening passed, staying warm, nice. Noah
listened to the crickets and the rustling

130
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,259
leaves, thinking that the sound of nature
was more real and aroused more emotion than

131
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:25,340
things like cars and planes. Natural things
gave back more than they took, and their sounds

132
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:31,240
always brought him back to the way man was
supposed to be. There were times during the

133
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,760
war, especially after a major engagement,
when he had often thought about these simple

134
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,560
sounds. “It’ll keep you from going crazy,”
his father had told him the day he’d shipped

135
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,459
out. “It’s God’s music and it’ll take
you home.”

136
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:53,819
He finished his tea, went inside, found a
book, then turned on the porch light on his

137
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:59,460
way back out. After sitting down again, he
looked at the book. It was old, the cover

138
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,030
was torn, and the pages were stained with
mud and water. It was Leaves of Grass by Walt

139
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:12,009
Whitman, and he had carried it with him throughout
the war. It had even taken a bullet for him

140
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,579
once.

141
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:19,540
He rubbed the cover, dusting it off just a
little. Then he let the book open randomly

142
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,750
and read the words in front of him:

143
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,940
This is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into
the wordless,

144
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:35,920
Away from books, away from art, the day erased,
the lesson done,

145
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:45,180
Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing,
pondering the themes thou lovest best,

146
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:56,639
Night, sleep, death and the stars.
He smiled to himself. For some reason Whitman

147
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,779
always reminded him of New Bern, and he was
glad he’d come back. Though he’d been

148
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,929
away for fourteen years, this was home and
he knew a lot of people here, most of them

149
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:13,670
from his youth. It wasn’t surprising. Like
so many southern towns, the people who lived

150
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:20,000
here never changed, they just grew a bit older.

151
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,900
His best friend these days was Gus, a seventy-year-old
black man who lived down the road. They had

152
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,610
met a couple of weeks after Noah bought the
house, when Gus had shown up with some homemade

153
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,559
liquor and Brunswick stew, and the two had
spent their first evening together getting

154
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,270
drunk and telling stories.

155
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:46,010
Now Gus would show up a couple of nights a
week, usually around eight. With four kids

156
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,510
and eleven grandchildren in the house, he
needed to get out of the house now and then,

157
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,580
and Noah couldn’t blame him. Usually Gus
would bring his harmonica, and after talking

158
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,539
for a little while, they’d play a few songs
together. Sometimes they played for hours.

159
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:08,909
He’d come to regard Gus as family. There
really wasn’t anyone else, at least not

160
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:15,390
since his father died last year. He was an
only child; his mother had died of influenza

161
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:21,260
when he was two, and though he had wanted
to at one time, he had never married.

162
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:29,990
But he had been in love once, that he knew.
Once and only once, and a long time ago. And

163
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:41,830
it had changed him forever. Perfect love did
that to a person, and this had been perfect.

164
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,920
Coastal clouds slowly began to roll across
the evening sky, turning silver with the reflection

165
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,179
of the moon. As they thickened, he leaned
his head back and rested it against the rocking

166
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,150
chair. His legs moved automatically, keeping
a steady rhythm, and as he did most evenings,

167
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:07,170
he felt his mind drifting back to a warm evening
like this fourteen years ago.

168
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:14,991
It was just after graduation 1932, the opening
night of the Neuse River Festival. The town

169
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:22,091
was out in full, enjoying barbecue and games
of chance. It was humid that night—for some

170
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:28,850
reason he remembered that clearly. He arrived
alone, and as he strolled through the crowd,

171
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,780
looking for friends, he saw Fin and Sarah,
two people he’d grown up with, talking to

172
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,789
a girl he’d never seen before. She was pretty,
he remembered thinking, and when he finally

173
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:47,480
joined them, she looked his way with a pair
of hazy eyes that kept on coming. “Hi,”

174
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,429
she’d said simply as she offered her hand,
“Finley’s told me a lot about you.”

175
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:59,950
An ordinary beginning, something that would
have been forgotten had it been anyone but

176
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:08,320
her. But as he shook her hand and met those
striking emerald eyes, he knew before he’d

177
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,110
taken his next breath that she was the one
he could spend the rest of his life looking

178
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:22,740
for but never find again. She seemed that
good, that perfect, while a summer wind blew

179
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,580
through the trees.

180
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,720
From there, it went like a tornado wind. Fin
told him she was spending the summer in New

181
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,440
Bern with her family because her father worked
for R. J. Reynolds, and though he only nodded,

182
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,820
the way she was looking at him made his silence
seem okay. Fin laughed then, because he knew

183
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,320
what was happening, and Sarah suggested they
get some cherry Cokes, and the four of them

184
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,409
stayed at the festival until the crowds were
thin and everything closed up for the night.

185
00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:01,611
They met the following day, and the day after
that, and they soon became inseparable. Every

186
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:07,470
morning but Sunday when he had to go to church,
he would finish his chores as quickly as possible,

187
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,911
then make a straight line to Fort Totten Park,
where she’d be waiting for him. Because

188
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,850
she was a newcomer and hadn’t spent time
in a small town before, they spent their days

189
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,440
doing things that were completely new to her.
He taught her how to bait a line and fish

190
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,159
the shallows for largemouth bass and took
her exploring through the backwoods of the

191
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,200
Croatan Forest. They rode in canoes and watched
summer thunderstorms, and to him it seemed

192
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,760
as though they’d always known each other.

193
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,179
But he learned things as well. At the town
dance in the tobacco barn, it was she who

194
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,890
taught him how to waltz and do the Charleston,
and though they stumbled through the first

195
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,790
few songs, her patience with him eventually
paid off, and they danced together until the

196
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:00,570
music ended. He walked her home afterward,
and when they paused on the porch after saying

197
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,530
good night, he kissed her for the first time
and wondered why he had waited as long as

198
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:13,650
he had. Later in the summer he brought her
to this house, looked past the decay, and

199
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:20,080
told her that one day he was going to own
it and fix it up. They spent hours together

200
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:27,190
talking about their dreams—his of seeing
the world, hers of being an artist—and on

201
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:35,539
a humid night in August, they both lost their
virginity. When she left three weeks later,

202
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:42,650
she took a piece of him and the rest of summer
with her. He watched her leave town on an

203
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:48,660
early rainy morning, watched through eyes
that hadn’t slept the night before, then

204
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:58,560
went home and packed a bag. He spent the next
week alone on Harkers Island.

205
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,020
Noah ran his hands through his hair and checked
his watch. Eight-twelve. He got up and walked

206
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:11,950
to the front of the house and looked up the
road. Gus wasn’t in sight, and Noah figured

207
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:18,330
he wouldn’t be coming. He went back to his
rocker and sat again.

208
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,790
He remembered talking to Gus about her. The
first time he mentioned her, Gus started to

209
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,070
shake his head and laugh. “So that’s the
ghost you been running from.” When asked

210
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,870
what he meant, Gus said, “You know, the
ghost, the memory. I been watchin’ you,

211
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:44,029
workin’ day and night, slavin’ so hard
you barely have time to catch your breath.

212
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:52,070
People do that for three reasons. Either they
crazy, or stupid, or tryin’ to forget. And

213
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:58,789
with you, I knew you was tryin’ to forget.
I just didn’t know what.”

214
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:05,700
He thought about what Gus had said. Gus was
right, of course. New Bern was haunted now.

215
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,290
Haunted by the ghost of her memory. He saw
her in Fort Totten Park, their place, every

216
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:18,920
time he walked by. Either sitting on the bench
or standing by the gate, always smiling, blond

217
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,890
hair softly touching her shoulders, her eyes
the color of emeralds. When he sat on the

218
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,080
porch at night with his guitar, he saw her
beside him, listening quietly as he played

219
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,280
the music of his childhood.

220
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,790
He felt the same when he went to Gaston’s
Drug Store, or to the Masonic theater, or

221
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:45,409
even when he strolled downtown. Everywhere
he looked, he saw her image, saw things that

222
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:48,740
brought her back to life.

223
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,450
It was odd, he knew that. He had grown up
in New Bern. Spent his first seventeen years

224
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,730
here. But when he thought about New Bern,
he seemed to remember only the last summer,

225
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,740
the summer they were together. Other memories
were simply fragments, pieces here and there

226
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,480
of growing up, and few, if any, evoked any
feeling.

227
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,210
He had told Gus about it one night, and not
only had Gus understood, but he had been the

228
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:26,299
first to explain why. He said simply, “My
daddy used to tell me that the first time

229
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:34,780
you fall in love, it changes your life forever,
and no matter how hard you try, the feelin’

230
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:41,210
never goes away. This girl you been tellin’
me about was your first love. And no matter

231
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:47,970
what you do, she’ll stay with you forever.”

232
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:56,070
Noah shook his head, and when her image began
to fade, he returned to Whitman. He read for

233
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,510
an hour, looking up every now and then to
see raccoons and possums scurrying near the

234
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:08,510
creek. At nine-thirty he closed the book,
went upstairs to the bedroom, and wrote in

235
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:15,409
his journal, including both personal observations
and the work he’d accomplished on the house.

236
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:21,590
Forty minutes later, he was sleeping. Clem
wandered up the stairs, sniffed him as he

237
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:37,240
slept, and then paced in circles before finally
curling up at the foot of his bed.

238
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,760
Earlier that evening and a hundred miles away,
she sat alone on the porch swing of her parents’

239
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:52,840
home, one leg crossed beneath her. The seat
had been slightly damp when she sat down;

240
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,649
rain had fallen earlier, hard and stinging,
but the clouds were fading now and she looked

241
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:04,550
past them, toward the stars, wondering if
she’d made the right decision. She’d struggled

242
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:10,870
with it for days—and had struggled some
more this evening—but in the end, she knew

243
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:17,529
she would never forgive herself if she let
the opportunity slip away.

244
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:23,450
Lon didn’t know the real reason she left
the following morning. The week before, she’d

245
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,350
hinted to him that she might want to visit
some antique shops near the coast. “It’s

246
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,780
just a couple of days,” she said, “and
besides, I need a break from planning the

247
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,690
wedding.” She felt bad about the lie but
knew there was no way she could tell him the

248
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,470
truth. Her leaving had nothing to do with
him, and it wouldn’t be fair of her to ask

249
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,630
him to understand.

250
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,360
It was an easy drive from Raleigh, slightly
more than two hours, and she arrived a little

251
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,830
before eleven. She checked into a small inn
downtown, went to her room, and unpacked her

252
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,470
suitcase, hanging her dresses in the closet
and putting everything else in the drawers.

253
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,840
She had a quick lunch, asked the waitress
for directions to the nearest antique stores,

254
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,640
then spent the next few hours shopping. By
four-thirty she was back in her room.

255
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,810
She sat on the edge of the bed, picked up
the phone, and called Lon. He couldn’t speak

256
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,169
long, he was due in court, but before they
hung up she gave him the phone number where

257
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:33,830
she was staying and promised to call the following
day. Good, she thought while hanging up the

258
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:41,880
phone. Routine conversation, nothing out of
the ordinary. Nothing to make him suspicious.

259
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:51,030
She’d known him almost four years now; it
was 1942 when they met, the world at war and

260
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:57,440
America one year in. Everyone was doing their
part, and she was volunteering at the hospital

261
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,010
downtown. She was both needed and appreciated
there, but it was more difficult than she’d

262
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,080
expected. The first waves of wounded young
soldiers were coming home, and she spent her

263
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:17,260
days with broken men and shattered bodies.
When Lon, with all his easy charm, introduced

264
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:24,409
himself at a Christmas party, she saw in him
exactly what she needed: someone with confidence

265
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:30,390
about the future and a sense of humor that
drove all her fears away.

266
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:36,179
He was handsome, intelligent, and driven,
a successful lawyer eight years older than

267
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:41,789
she, and he pursued his job with passion,
not only winning cases, but also making a

268
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:48,490
name for himself. She understood his vigorous
pursuit of success, for her father and most

269
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:54,049
of the men she met in her social circle were
the same way. Like them, he’d been raised

270
00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:00,060
that way, and in the caste system of the South,
family name and accomplishments were often

271
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:08,519
the most important consideration in marriage.
In some cases, they were the only consideration.

272
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,600
Though she had quietly rebelled against this
idea since childhood and had dated a few men

273
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,840
best described as reckless, she found herself
drawn to Lon’s easy ways and had gradually

274
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,550
come to love him. Despite the long hours he
worked, he was good to her. He was a gentleman,

275
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:34,110
both mature and responsible, and during those
terrible periods of the war when she needed

276
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:41,679
someone to hold her, he never once turned
her away. She felt secure with him and knew

277
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,750
he loved her as well, and that was why she
had accepted his proposal.

278
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,630
Thinking these things made her feel guilty
about being here, and she knew she should

279
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,360
pack her things and leave before she changed
her mind. She had done it once before, long

280
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,049
ago, and if she left now, she was sure she
would never have the strength to return here

281
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:13,320
again. She picked up her pocketbook, hesitated,
and almost made it to the door. But coincidence

282
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,360
had pushed her here, and she put the pocketbook
down, again realizing that if she quit now,

283
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,620
she would always wonder what would have happened.
And she didn’t think she could live with

284
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,340
that.

285
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,230
She went to the bathroom and started a bath.
After checking the temperature, she walked

286
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,890
to the dresser, taking off her gold earrings
as she crossed the room. She found her makeup

287
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,490
bag, opened it, and pulled out a razor and
a bar of soap, then undressed in front of

288
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,590
the bureau.

289
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,669
She had been called beautiful since she was
a young girl, and once she was naked, she

290
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:57,090
looked at herself in the mirror. Her body
was firm and well proportioned, breasts softly

291
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:03,860
rounded, stomach flat, legs slim. She’d
inherited her mother’s high cheekbones,

292
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:11,149
smooth skin, and blond hair, but her best
feature was her own. She had “eyes like

293
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:16,399
ocean waves,” as Lon liked to say.

294
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,260
Taking the razor and soap, she went to the
bathroom again, turned off the faucet, set

295
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,480
a towel where she could reach it, and stepped
in gingerly.

296
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,840
She liked the way a bath relaxed her, and
she slipped lower in the water. The day had

297
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,529
been long and her back was tense, but she
was pleased she had finished shopping so quickly.

298
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:45,230
She had to go back to Raleigh with something
tangible, and the things she had picked out

299
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,679
would work fine. She made a mental note to
find the names of some other stores in the

300
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,350
Beaufort area, then suddenly doubted she would
need to. Lon wasn’t the type to check up

301
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,700
on her.

302
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,649
She reached for the soap, lathered up, and
began to shave her legs. As she did, she thought

303
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:11,200
about her parents and what they would think
of her behavior. No doubt they would disapprove,

304
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,059
especially her mother. Her mother had never
really accepted what had happened the summer

305
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:24,470
they’d spent here and wouldn’t accept
it now, no matter what reason she gave.

306
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:30,000
She soaked a while longer in the tub before
finally getting out and toweling off. She

307
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,649
went to the closet and looked for a dress,
finally choosing a long yellow one that dipped

308
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:40,090
slightly in the front, the kind of dress that
was common in the South. She slipped it on

309
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,910
and looked in the mirror, turning from side
to side. It fit her well and made her look

310
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:52,230
feminine, but she eventually decided against
it and put it back on the hanger.

311
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:59,389
Instead she found a more casual, less revealing
dress and put that on. Light blue with a touch

312
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:04,080
of lace, it buttoned up the front, and though
it didn’t look quite as nice as the first

313
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,230
one, it conveyed an image she thought would
be more appropriate.

314
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:16,090
She wore little makeup, just a touch of eye
shadow and mascara to accent her eyes. Perfume

315
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:23,510
next, not too much. She found a pair of small-hooped
earrings, put those on, then slipped on the

316
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:29,860
tan, low-heeled sandals she had been wearing
earlier. She brushed her blond hair, pinned

317
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:36,250
it up, and looked in the mirror. No, it was
too much, she thought, and she let it back

318
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,470
down. Better.

319
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:46,929
When she was finished she stepped back and
evaluated herself. She looked good: not too

320
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,929
dressy, not too casual. She didn’t want
to overdo it. After all, she didn’t know

321
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:57,970
what to expect. It had been a long time—probably
too long—and many different things could

322
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:03,150
have happened, even things she didn’t want
to consider.

323
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:10,990
She looked down and saw her hands were shaking,
and she laughed to herself. It was strange;

324
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:18,109
she wasn’t normally this nervous. Like Lon,
she had always been confident, even as a child.

325
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:22,281
She remembered that it had been a problem
at times, especially when she dated, because

326
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:26,680
it had intimidated most of the boys her age.

327
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,440
She found her pocketbook and car keys, then
picked up the room key. She turned it over

328
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,980
in her hand a couple of times, thinking, You’ve
come this far, don’t give up now, and almost

329
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:46,230
left then, but instead sat on the bed again.
She checked her watch. Almost six o’clock.

330
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,550
She knew she had to leave in a few minutes—she
didn’t want to arrive after dark, but she

331
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,990
needed a little more time.

332
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:59,770
“Damn,” she whispered, “what am I doing
here? I shouldn’t be here. There’s no

333
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:08,240
reason for it,” but once she said it she
knew it wasn’t true. There was something

334
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,620
here. If nothing else, she would have her
answer.

335
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,720
She opened her pocketbook and thumbed through
it until she came to a folded-up piece of

336
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,849
newspaper. After taking it out slowly, almost
reverently, being careful not to rip it, she

337
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:33,200
unfolded it and stared at it for a while.
“This is why,” she finally said to herself,

338
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,690
“this is what it’s all about.”

339
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:45,530
Noah got up at five and kayaked for an hour
up Brices Creek, as he usually did. When he

340
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:50,560
finished, he changed into his work clothes,
warmed some biscuits from the day before,

341
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,630
grabbed a couple of apples, and washed his
breakfast down with two cups of coffee.

342
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,640
He worked on the fencing again, repairing
most of the posts that needed it. It was Indian

343
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,530
summer, the temperature over eighty degrees,
and by lunchtime he was hot and tired and

344
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,970
glad for the break.

345
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,710
He ate at the creek because the mullets were
jumping. He liked to watch them jump three

346
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,810
or four times and glide through the air before
vanishing into the brackish water. For some

347
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:24,480
reason he had always been pleased by the fact
that their instinct hadn’t changed for thousands,

348
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,260
maybe tens of thousands, of years.

349
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,810
Sometimes he wondered if man’s instincts
had changed in that time and always concluded

350
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:40,640
that they hadn’t. At least in the basic,
most primal ways. As far as he could tell,

351
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:47,380
man had always been aggressive, always striving
to dominate, trying to control the world and

352
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:53,690
everything in it. The war in Europe and Japan
proved that.

353
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,010
He quit working a little after three and walked
to a small shed that sat near his dock. He

354
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,470
went in, found his fishing pole, a couple
of lures, and some live crickets he kept on

355
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:10,640
hand, then walked out to the dock, baited
his hook, and cast his line.

356
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,359
Fishing always made him reflect on his life,
and he did it now. After his mother died,

357
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:21,530
he could remember spending his days in a dozen
different homes, and for one reason or another,

358
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:27,930
he stuttered badly as a child and was teased
for it. He began to speak less and less, and

359
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:33,200
by the age of five, he wouldn’t speak at
all. When he started classes, his teachers

360
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,860
thought he was retarded and recommended that
he be pulled out of school.

361
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:43,380
Instead, his father took matters into his
own hands. He kept him in school and afterward

362
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,329
made him come to the lumberyard, where he
worked, to haul and stack wood. “It’s

363
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:52,990
good that we spend some time together,”
he would say as they worked side by side,

364
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,950
“just like my daddy and I did.”

365
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:02,339
During their time together, his father would
talk about birds and animals or tell stories

366
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:09,240
and legends common to North Carolina. Within
a few months Noah was speaking again, though

367
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,560
not well, and his father decided to teach
him to read with books of poetry. “Learn

368
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,890
to read this aloud and you’ll be able to
say anything you want to.” His father had

369
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:27,090
been right again, and by the following year,
Noah had lost his stutter. But he continued

370
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:32,240
to go to the lumberyard every day simply because
his father was there, and in the evenings

371
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,970
he would read the works of Whitman and Tennyson
aloud as his father rocked beside him. He

372
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,000
had been reading poetry ever since.

373
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:51,010
When he got a little older, he spent most
of his weekends and vacations alone. He explored

374
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:56,920
the Croatan Forest in his first canoe, following
Brices Creek for twenty miles until he could

375
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,089
go no farther, then hiked the remaining miles
to the coast. Camping and exploring became

376
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:09,230
his passion, and he spent hours in the forest,
sitting beneath blackjack oak trees, whistling

377
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:16,760
quietly, and playing his guitar for beavers
and geese and wild blue herons. Poets knew

378
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:24,000
that isolation in nature, far from people
and things man-made, was good for the soul,

379
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,829
and he’d always identified with poets.

380
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:33,869
Although he was quiet, years of heavy lifting
at the lumberyard helped him excel in sports,

381
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:39,850
and his athletic success led to popularity.
He enjoyed the football games and track meets,

382
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,220
and though most of his team-mates spent their
free time together as well, he rarely joined

383
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,380
them. An occasional person found him arrogant;
most simply figured he had grown up a bit

384
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:56,670
faster than everyone else. He had a few girlfriends
in school, but none had ever made an impression

385
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,930
on him. Except for one. And she came after
graduation.

386
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,670
Allie. His Allie.

387
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,701
He remembered talking to Fin about Allie after
they’d left the festival that first night,

388
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:18,180
and Fin had laughed. Then he’d made two
predictions: first, that they would fall in

389
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:24,240
love, and second, that it wouldn’t work
out.

390
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,910
There was a slight tug at his line and Noah
hoped for a largemouth bass, but the tugging

391
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:36,329
eventually stopped, and after reeling his
line in and checking the bait, he cast again.

392
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:43,099
Fin ended up being right on both counts. Most
of the summer, she had to make excuses to

393
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:48,230
her parents whenever they wanted to see each
other. It wasn’t that they didn’t like

394
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,850
him—it was that he was from a different
class, too poor, and they would never approve

395
00:41:53,850 --> 00:42:00,300
if their daughter became serious with someone
like him. “I don’t care what my parents

396
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:07,160
think, I love you and always will,” she
would say. “We’ll find a way to be together.”

397
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,680
But in the end they couldn’t. By early September
the tobacco had been harvested and she had

398
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,400
no choice but to return with her family to
Winston-Salem. “Only the summer is over,

399
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,740
Allie, not us,” he’d said the morning
she left. “We’ll never be over.” But

400
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:35,970
they were. For a reason he didn’t fully
understand, the letters he wrote went unanswered.

401
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:44,180
Eventually he decided to leave New Bern to
help get her off his mind, but also because

402
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,940
the Depression made earning a living in New
Bern almost impossible. He went first to Norfolk

403
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,590
and worked at a shipyard for six months before
he was laid off, then moved to New Jersey

404
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,500
because he’d heard the economy wasn’t
so bad there.

405
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,339
He eventually found a job in a scrap yard,
separating scrap metal from everything else.

406
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:11,570
The owner, a Jewish man named Morris Goldman,
was intent on collecting as much scrap metal

407
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:17,120
as he could, convinced that a war was going
to start in Europe and that America would

408
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,950
be dragged in again. Noah, though, didn’t
care about the reason. He was just happy to

409
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,470
have a job.

410
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:30,540
His years in the lumberyard had toughened
him to this type of labor, and he worked hard.

411
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,510
Not only did it help him keep his mind off
Allie during the day, but it was something

412
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:40,210
he felt he had to do. His daddy had always
said: “Give a day’s work for a day’s

413
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:47,430
pay. Anything less is stealing.” That attitude
pleased his boss. “It’s a shame you aren’t

414
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,960
Jewish,” Goldman would say, “you’re
such a fine boy in so many other ways.”

415
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,349
It was the best compliment Goldman could give.

416
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:03,370
He continued to think about Allie, especially
at night. He wrote her once a month but never

417
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:10,930
received a reply. Eventually he wrote a final
letter and forced himself to accept the fact

418
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:16,740
that the summer they’d spent with one another
was the only thing they’d ever share.

419
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,860
Still, though, she stayed with him. Three
years after the last letter, he went to Winston-Salem

420
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,849
in the hope of finding her. He went to her
house, discovered that she had moved, and

421
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:33,500
after talking to some neighbors, finally called
RJR. The girl who answered the phone was new

422
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,750
and didn’t recognize the name, but she poked
around the personnel files for him. She found

423
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,619
out that Allie’s father had left the company
and that no forwarding address was listed.

424
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:49,760
That trip was the first and last time he ever
looked for her.

425
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,900
For the next eight years, he worked for Goldman.
At first he was one of twelve employees, but

426
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,619
as the years dragged on, the company grew,
and he was promoted. By 1940 he had mastered

427
00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:06,160
the business and was running the entire operation,
brokering the deals and managing a staff of

428
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,140
thirty. The yard had become the largest scrap
metal dealer on the East Coast.

429
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,650
During that time, he dated a few different
women. He became serious with one, a waitress

430
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,950
from the local diner with deep blue eyes and
silky black hair. Although they dated for

431
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:28,480
two years and had many good times together,
he never came to feel the same way about her

432
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,920
as he did about Allie.

433
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,170
But neither did he forget her. She was a few
years older than he was, and it was she who

434
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:41,980
taught him the ways to please a woman, the
places to touch and kiss, where to linger,

435
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:47,960
the things to whisper. They would sometimes
spend an entire day in bed, holding each other

436
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,600
and making the kind of love that fully satisfied
both of them.

437
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,770
She had known they wouldn’t be together
forever. Toward the end of their relationship

438
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:01,780
she’d told him once, “I wish I could give
you what you’re looking for, but I don’t

439
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:07,130
know what it is. There’s a part of you that
you keep closed off from everyone, including

440
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:15,630
me. It’s as if I’m not the one you’re
really with. Your mind is on someone else.”

441
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,819
He tried to deny it, but she didn’t believe
him. “I’m a woman—I know these things.

442
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:27,680
When you look at me sometimes, I know you’re
seeing someone else. It’s like you keep

443
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:35,430
waiting for her to pop out of thin air to
take you away from all this. . . .” A month

444
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,960
later she visited him at work and told him
she’d met someone else. He understood. They

445
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,869
parted as friends, and the following year
he received a postcard from her saying she

446
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:50,510
was married. He hadn’t heard from her since.

447
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,119
While he was in New Jersey, he would visit
his father once a year around Christmas. They’d

448
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,890
spend some time fishing and talking, and once
in a while they’d take a trip to the coast

449
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,150
to go camping on the Outer Banks near Ocracoke.

450
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:12,290
In December 1941, when he was twenty-six,
the war began, just as Goldman had predicted.

451
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:17,180
Noah walked into his office the following
month and informed Goldman of his intent to

452
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:23,990
enlist, then returned to New Bern to say good-bye
to his father. Five weeks later he found himself

453
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:29,830
in boot camp. While there, he received a letter
from Goldman thanking him for his work, together

454
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:35,369
with a copy of a certificate entitling him
to a small percentage of the scrap yard if

455
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:40,610
it ever sold. “I couldn’t have done it
without you,” the letter said. “You’re

456
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:46,920
the finest young man who ever worked for me,
even if you aren’t Jewish.”

457
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,470
He spent his next three years with Patton’s
Third Army, tramping through deserts in North

458
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:58,410
Africa and forests in Europe with thirty pounds
on his back, his infantry unit never far from

459
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:05,569
action. He watched his friends die around
him; watched as some of them were buried thousands

460
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:11,140
of miles from home. Once, while hiding in
a foxhole near the Rhine, he imagined he saw

461
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,860
Allie watching over him.

462
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:19,100
He remembered the war ending in Europe, then
a few months later in Japan. Just before he

463
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:24,050
was discharged, he received a letter from
a lawyer in New Jersey representing Morris

464
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:29,650
Goldman. Upon meeting the lawyer, he found
out that Goldman had died a year earlier and

465
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:35,359
his estate liquidated. The business had been
sold, and Noah was given a check for almost

466
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,960
seventy thousand dollars. For some reason
he was oddly unexcited about it.

467
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,550
The following week he returned to New Bern
and bought the house. He remembered bringing

468
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,930
his father around later, showing him what
he was going to do, pointing out the changes

469
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:57,670
he intended to make. His father seemed weak
as he walked around, coughing and wheezing.

470
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,589
Noah was concerned, but his father told him
not to worry, assuring him that he had the

471
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:03,589
flu.

472
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:08,940
Less than one month later his father died
of pneumonia and was buried next to his wife

473
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:14,951
in the local cemetery. Noah tried to stop
by regularly to leave some flowers; occasionally

474
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:21,000
he left a note. And every night without fail
he took a moment to remember him, then said

475
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,030
a prayer for the man who’d taught him everything
that mattered.

476
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:31,069
After reeling in the line, he put the gear
away and went back to the house. His neighbor,

477
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:35,660
Martha Shaw, was there to thank him, bringing
three loaves of homemade bread and some biscuits

478
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,180
in appreciation for what he’d done. Her
husband had been killed in the war, leaving

479
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,280
her with three children and a tired shack
of a house to raise them in. Winter was coming,

480
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,450
and he’d spent a few days at her place last
week repairing her roof, replacing broken

481
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:55,559
windows and sealing the others, and fixing
her woodstove. Hopefully, it would be enough

482
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,080
to get them through.

483
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,640
Once she’d left, he got in his battered
Dodge truck and went to see Gus. He always

484
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,400
stopped there when he was going to the store
because Gus’s family didn’t have a car.

485
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,160
One of the daughters hopped up and rode with
him, and they did their shopping at Capers

486
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,910
General Store. When he got home he didn’t
unpack the groceries right away. Instead he

487
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:29,220
showered, found a Budweiser and a book by
Dylan Thomas, and went to sit on the porch.

488
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,750
She still had trouble believing it, even as
she held the proof in her hands.

489
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,349
It had been in the newspaper at her parents’
house three Sundays ago. She had gone to the

490
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:44,460
kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and when she’d
returned to the table, her father had smiled

491
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,380
and pointed at a small picture. “Remember
this?”

492
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:54,119
He handed her the paper, and after an uninterested
first glance, something in the picture caught

493
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:00,739
her eye and she took a closer look. “It
can’t be,” she whispered, and when her

494
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:05,540
father looked at her curiously, she ignored
him, sat down, and read the article without

495
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:11,980
speaking. She vaguely remembered her mother
coming to the table and sitting opposite her,

496
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,440
and when she finally put aside the paper,
her mother was staring at her with the same

497
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,170
expression her father had just moments before.

498
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:27,200
“Are you okay?” her mother asked over
her coffee cup. “You look a little pale.”

499
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,030
She didn’t answer right away, she couldn’t,
and it was then that she’d noticed her hands

500
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,470
were shaking. That had been when it started.

501
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:45,140
“And here it will end, one way or the other,”
she whispered again. She refolded the scrap

502
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,210
of paper and put it back, remembering that
she had left her parents’ home later that

503
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:54,370
day with the paper so she could cut out the
article. She read it again before she went

504
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:59,410
to bed that night, trying to fathom the coincidence,
and read it again the next morning as if to

505
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:05,920
make sure the whole thing wasn’t a dream.
And now, after three weeks of long walks alone,

506
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,480
after three weeks of distraction, it was the
reason she’d come.

507
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,140
When asked, she said her erratic behavior
was due to stress. It was the perfect excuse;

508
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:22,140
everyone understood, including Lon, and that’s
why he hadn’t argued when she’d wanted

509
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,460
to get away for a couple of days. The wedding
plans were stressful to everyone involved.

510
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,859
Almost five hundred people were invited, including
the governor, one senator, and the ambassador

511
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:39,950
to Peru. It was too much, in her opinion,
but their engagement was news and had dominated

512
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:45,059
the social pages since they had announced
their plans six months ago. Occasionally she

513
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:50,430
felt like running away with Lon to get married
without the fuss. But she knew he wouldn’t

514
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:56,990
agree; like the aspiring politician he was,
he loved being the center of attention.

515
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:03,660
She took a deep breath and stood again. “It’s
now or never,” she whispered, then picked

516
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,930
up her things and went to the door. She paused
only slightly before opening it and going

517
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:15,099
downstairs. The manager smiled as she walked
by, and she could feel his eyes on her as

518
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:20,710
she left and went to her car. She slipped
behind the wheel, looked at herself one last

519
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:25,730
time, then started the engine and turned right
onto Front Street.

520
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:31,340
She wasn’t surprised that she still knew
her way around town so well. Even though she

521
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:36,869
hadn’t been here in years, it wasn’t large
and she navigated the streets easily. After

522
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:41,799
crossing the Trent River on an old-fashioned
drawbridge, she turned onto a gravel road

523
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:45,990
and began the final leg of her journey.

524
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:51,710
It was beautiful here in the low country,
as it always had been. Unlike the Piedmont

525
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:57,309
area where she grew up, the land was flat,
but it had the same silty, fertile soil that

526
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:04,670
was ideal for cotton and tobacco. Those two
crops and timber kept the towns alive in this

527
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,829
part of the state, and as she drove along
the road outside town, she saw the beauty

528
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:13,540
that had first attracted people to this region.

529
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:20,190
To her, it hadn’t changed at all. Broken
sunlight passed through water oaks and hickory

530
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:27,069
trees a hundred feet tall, illuminating the
colors of fall. On her left, a river the color

531
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:32,510
of iron veered toward the road and then turned
away before giving up its life to a different,

532
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:39,369
larger river another mile ahead. The gravel
road itself wound its way between antebellum

533
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:44,880
farms, and she knew that for some of the farmers,
life hadn’t changed since before their grandparents

534
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,470
were born. The constancy of the place brought
back a flood of memories, and she felt her

535
00:54:52,470 --> 00:55:01,070
insides tighten as one by one she recognized
landmarks she’d long since forgotten.

536
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:08,380
The sun hung just above the trees on her left,
and as she rounded a curve, she passed an

537
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:16,180
old church, abandoned for years but still
standing. She had explored it that summer,

538
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:21,800
looking for souvenirs from the War between
the States, and as her car passed by, the

539
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,450
memories of that day became stronger, as if
they’d just happened yesterday.

540
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:33,089
A majestic oak tree on the banks of the river
came into view next, and the memories became

541
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:40,809
more intense. It looked the same as it had
back then, branches low and thick, stretching

542
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:47,470
horizontally along the ground with Spanish
moss draped over the limbs like a veil. She

543
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:53,130
remembered sitting beneath the tree on a hot
July day with someone who looked at her with

544
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:59,780
a longing that took everything else away.
And it had been at that moment that she’d

545
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,530
first fallen in love.

546
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:09,609
He was two years older than she was, and as
she drove along this roadway-in-time, he slowly

547
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:16,920
came into focus once again. He always looked
older than he really was, she remembered thinking.

548
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,609
His appearance was that of someone slightly
weathered, almost like a farmer coming home

549
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:29,240
after hours in the field. He had the callused
hands and broad shoulders that came to those

550
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,760
who worked hard for a living, and the first
faint lines were beginning to form around

551
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,440
the dark eyes that seemed to read her every
thought.

552
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:48,789
He was tall and strong, with light brown hair,
and handsome in his own way, but it was his

553
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:55,940
voice that she remembered most of all. He
had read to her that day; read to her as they

554
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:02,310
lay in the grass beneath the tree with an
accent that was soft and fluent, almost musical

555
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:09,740
in quality. It was the kind of voice that
belonged on radio, and it seemed to hang in

556
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:18,079
the air when he read to her. She remembered
closing her eyes, listening closely, and letting

557
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,339
the words he was reading touch her soul:

558
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:35,109
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at

559
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:44,270
the runaway sun . . .
He thumbed through old books with dog-eared

560
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:53,040
pages, books he’d read a hundred times.
He’d read for a while, then stop, and the

561
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,599
two of them would talk. She would tell him
what she wanted in her life— her hopes and

562
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:04,119
dreams for the future—and he would listen
intently and then promise to make it all come

563
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:11,859
true. And the way he said it made her believe
him, and she knew then how much he meant to

564
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:20,329
her. Occasionally, when she asked, he would
talk about himself or explain why he had chosen

565
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:26,349
a particular poem and what he thought of it,
and at other times he just studied her in

566
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:29,849
that intense way of his.

567
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:36,190
They watched the sun go down and ate together
under the stars. It was getting late by then,

568
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:40,569
and she knew her parents would be furious
if they knew where she was. At that moment,

569
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:46,770
though, it really didn’t matter to her.
All she could think about was how special

570
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:52,910
the day had been, how special he was, and
as they started toward her house a few minutes

571
00:58:52,910 --> 00:59:03,750
later, he took her hand in his and she felt
the way it warmed her the whole way back.

572
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:11,079
Another turn in the road and she finally saw
it in the distance. The house had changed

573
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,970
dramatically from what she remembered. She
slowed the car as she approached, turning

574
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:22,660
into the long, tree-lined dirt drive that
led to the beacon that had summoned her from

575
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,650
Raleigh.

576
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:30,099
She drove slowly, looking toward the house,
and took a deep breath when she saw him on

577
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:37,400
the porch, watching her car. He was dressed
casually. From a distance, he looked the same

578
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,710
as he had back then. For a moment, when the
light from the sun was behind him, he almost

579
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,400
seemed to vanish into the scenery.

580
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:53,160
Her car continued forward, rolling slowly,
then finally stopped beneath an oak tree that

581
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:59,530
shaded the front of the house. She turned
the key, never taking her eyes from him, and

582
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,680
the engine sputtered to a halt.

583
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:07,980
He stepped off the porch and began to approach
her, walking easily, then suddenly stopped

584
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:15,770
cold as she emerged from the car. For a long
time all they could do was stare at each other

585
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,329
without moving.

586
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:26,329
Allison Nelson, twenty-nine years old and
engaged, a socialite, searching for answers

587
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:36,630
she needed to know, and Noah Calhoun, the
dreamer, thirty-one, visited by the ghost

588
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:47,619
that had come to dominate his life.

589
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:52,020
Reunion

590
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,360
Neither one of them moved as they faced each
other.

591
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:02,549
He hadn’t said anything, his muscles seemed
frozen, and for a second she thought he didn’t

592
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:08,570
recognize her. Suddenly she felt guilty about
showing up this way, without warning, and

593
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,869
this made it harder. She had thought it would
be easier somehow, that she would know what

594
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:21,640
to say. But she didn’t. Everything that
came into her head seemed inappropriate, somehow

595
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,170
lacking.

596
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:29,780
Thoughts of the summer they’d shared came
back to her, and as she stared at him, she

597
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:37,369
noticed how little he’d changed since she’d
last seen him. He looked good, she thought.

598
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:43,050
With his shirt tucked loosely into old faded
jeans, she could see the same broad shoulders

599
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:49,850
she remembered, tapering down to narrow hips
and a flat stomach. He was tan, too, as if

600
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:53,710
he’d worked outside all summer, and though
his hair was a little thinner and lighter

601
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:59,930
than she remembered, he looked the same as
he had when she’d known him last.

602
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:05,529
When she was finally ready, she took a deep
breath and smiled.

603
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:11,079
“Hello, Noah. It’s good to see you again.”

604
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:17,279
Her comment startled him, and he looked at
her with amazement in his eyes. Then, after

605
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:21,470
shaking his head slightly, he slowly began
to smile.

606
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:30,430
“You too . . . ,” he stammered. He brought
his hand to his chin, and she noticed he hadn’t

607
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:38,900
shaved. “It’s really you, isn’t it?
I can’t believe it. . . .”

608
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:45,319
She heard the shock in his voice as he spoke,
and surprising her, it all came together—being

609
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:51,810
here, seeing him. She felt something twitch
inside, something deep and old, something

610
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,609
that made her dizzy for just a second.

611
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:59,390
She caught herself fighting for control. She
hadn’t expected this to happen, didn’t

612
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:07,650
want it to happen. She was engaged now. She
hadn’t come here for this ...yet ...

613
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,829
Yet...

614
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:19,809
Yet the feeling went on despite herself, and
for a brief moment she felt fifteen again.

615
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:25,770
Felt as she hadn’t in years, as if all her
dreams could still come true.

616
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:31,230
Felt as though she’d finally come home.

617
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,780
Without another word they came together, as
if it were the most natural thing in the world,

618
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:43,750
and he put his arms around her, drawing her
close. They held each other tightly, making

619
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:49,590
it real, both of them letting the fourteen
years of separation dissolve in the deepening

620
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,579
twilight.

621
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:58,430
They stayed like that for a long time before
she finally pulled back to look at him. Up

622
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:04,609
close, she could see the changes she hadn’t
noticed at first. He was a man now, and his

623
01:04:04,609 --> 01:04:11,380
face had lost the softness of youth. The faint
lines around his eyes had deepened, and there

624
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:17,529
was a scar on his chin that hadn’t been
there before. There was a new edge to him;

625
01:04:17,529 --> 01:04:25,670
he seemed less innocent, more cautious, and
yet the way he was holding her made her realize

626
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:32,030
how much she’d missed him since she’d
seen him last.

627
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:37,330
Her eyes brimmed with tears as they finally
released each other. She laughed nervously

628
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:41,230
under her breath while wiping the tears from
the corners of her eyes.

629
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:46,200
“Are you okay?” he asked, a thousand other
questions on his face.

630
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,270
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to cry....”

631
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:55,579
“It’s okay,” he said, smiling, “I
still can’t believe it’s you. How did

632
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:57,710
you find me?”

633
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:02,859
She stepped back, trying to compose herself,
wiping away the last of her tears.

634
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:08,170
“I saw the story on the house in the Raleigh
paper a couple of weeks ago, and I had to

635
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,039
come see you again.”

636
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:18,859
Noah smiled broadly. “I’m glad you did.”
He stepped back just a bit. “God, you look

637
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:25,319
fantastic. You’re even prettier now than
you were then.”

638
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:30,559
She felt the blood in her face. Just like
fourteen years ago.

639
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:38,520
“Thank you. You look great, too.” And
he did, no doubt about it. The years had treated

640
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,190
him well.

641
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:47,030
“So what have you been up to? Why are you
here?”

642
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,809
His questions brought her back to the present,
making her realize what could happen if she

643
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:57,630
wasn’t careful. Don’t let this get out
of hand, she told herself; the longer it goes

644
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:03,190
on, the harder it’s going to be. And she
didn’t want it to get any harder.

645
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:09,990
But God, those eyes. Those soft, dark eyes.

646
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:16,890
She turned away and took a deep breath, wondering
how to say it, and when she finally started,

647
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:23,310
her voice was quiet. “Noah, before you get
the wrong idea, I did want to see you again,

648
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:29,859
but there’s more to it than just that.”
She paused for a second. “I came here for

649
01:06:29,859 --> 01:06:33,490
a reason. There’s something I have to tell
you.”

650
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,640
“What is it?”

651
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,640
She looked away and didn’t answer for a
moment, surprised that she couldn’t tell

652
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:48,170
him just yet. In the silence, Noah felt a
sinking feeling in his stomach. Whatever it

653
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,170
was, was bad.

654
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:57,579
“I don’t know how to say it. I thought
I did at first, but now I’m not so sure.

655
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:58,579
. . .”

656
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:02,430
The air was suddenly rattled by the sharp
cry of a raccoon, and Clem came out from under

657
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:07,490
the porch, barking gruffly. Both of them turned
at the commotion, and Allie was glad for the

658
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,490
distraction.

659
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:11,549
“Is he yours?” she asked.

660
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:17,859
Noah nodded, feeling the tightness in his
stomach. “Actually it’s a she. Clementine’s

661
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:24,810
her name. But yeah, she’s all mine.” They
both watched as Clem shook her head, stretched,

662
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:30,760
then wandered toward the sounds. Allie’s
eyes widened just a bit when she saw her limp

663
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,760
away.

664
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,720
“What happened to her leg?” she asked,
stalling for time.

665
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,559
“Hit by a car a few months back. Doc Harrison,
the vet, called me to see if I wanted her

666
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:45,380
because her owner didn’t anymore. After
I saw what had happened, I guess I just couldn’t

667
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,190
let her be put down.”

668
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:54,920
“You were always nice like that,” she
said, trying to relax. She paused, then looked

669
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:00,910
past him toward the house. “You did a wonderful
job restoring it. It looks perfect, just like

670
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,349
I knew it would someday.”

671
01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:08,299
He turned his head in the same direction as
hers while he wondered about the small talk

672
01:08:08,299 --> 01:08:10,020
and what she was holding back.

673
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:16,890
“Thanks, that’s nice of you. It was quite
a project, though. I don’t know if I would

674
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:17,890
do it again.”

675
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:24,370
“Of course you would,” she said. She knew
exactly how he felt about this place. But

676
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:31,210
then, she knew how he felt about everything—or
at least she had a long time ago.

677
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:37,009
And with that thought, she realized how much
had changed since then. They were strangers

678
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:43,810
now; she could tell by looking at him. Could
tell that fourteen years apart was a long

679
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:47,240
time. Too long.

680
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:53,359
“What is it, Allie?” He turned to her,
compelling her to look, but she continued

681
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,940
to stare at the house.

682
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:59,270
“I’m being rather silly, aren’t I?”
she asked, trying to smile.

683
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,449
“What do you mean?”

684
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:05,420
“This whole thing. Showing up out of the
blue, not knowing what I want to say. You

685
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,140
must think I’m crazy.”

686
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:15,330
“You’re not crazy,” he said gently.
He reached for her hand, and she let him hold

687
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:19,969
it as they stood next to one another. He went
on:

688
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:26,230
“Even though I don’t know why, I can see
this is hard for you. Why don’t we go for

689
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,350
a walk?”

690
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,909
“Like we used to?”

691
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:33,870
“Why not? I think we both could use one.”

692
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:39,640
She hesitated and looked to his front door.
“Do you need to tell anyone?”

693
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,730
He shook his head.

694
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:49,239
“No, there’s no one to tell. It’s just
me and Clem.” Even though she’d asked,

695
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:53,759
she had suspected there wouldn’t be anyone
else, and inside she didn’t know how to

696
01:09:53,759 --> 01:10:00,600
feel about that. But it did make what she
wanted to say a little harder. It would have

697
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,159
been easier if there was someone else.

698
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:10,320
They started toward the river and turned on
a path near the bank. She let go of his hand,

699
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,530
surprising him, and walked on with just enough
distance between them so that they couldn’t

700
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:16,970
accidentally touch.

701
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:25,440
He looked at her. She was pretty still, with
thick hair and soft eyes, and she moved so

702
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,400
gracefully that it almost seemed as though
she were gliding. He’d seen beautiful women

703
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,530
before, though, women who caught his eye,
but to his mind they usually lacked the traits

704
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:45,031
he found most desirable. Traits like intelligence,
confidence, strength of spirit, passion, traits

705
01:10:45,031 --> 01:10:53,330
that inspired others to greatness, traits
he aspired to himself.

706
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:59,390
Allie had those traits, he knew, and as they
walked now, he sensed them once again lingering

707
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:05,560
beneath the surface. “A living poem” had
always been the words that came to mind when

708
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,880
he tried to describe her to others.

709
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,929
“How long have you been back here?” she
asked as the path gave way to a small grass

710
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:15,929
hill.

711
01:11:15,929 --> 01:11:20,890
“Since last December. I worked up north
for a while, then spent the last three years

712
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:21,890
in Europe.”

713
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:27,480
She looked to him with questions in her eyes.
“The war?”

714
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,890
He nodded and she went on.

715
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:34,179
“I thought you might be there. I’m glad
you made it out okay.”

716
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:36,840
“Me too,” he said.

717
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,840
“Are you glad to be back home?”

718
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,720
“Yeah. My roots are here. This is where
I’m supposed to be.” He paused. “But

719
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:52,890
what about you?” He asked the question softly,
suspecting the worst.

720
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,179
It was a long moment before she answered.

721
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:59,450
“I’m engaged.”

722
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:05,490
He looked down when she said it, suddenly
feeling just a bit weaker. So that was it.

723
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:09,040
That’s what she needed to tell him.

724
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:15,409
“Congratulations,” he finally said, wondering
how convincing he sounded. “When’s the

725
01:12:15,409 --> 01:12:16,630
big day?”

726
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,760
“Three weeks from Saturday. Lon wanted a
November wedding.”

727
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,960
“Lon?”

728
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,660
“Lon Hammond Jr. My fiancé.”

729
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:33,469
He nodded, not surprised. The Hammonds were
one of the most powerful and influential families

730
01:12:33,469 --> 01:12:39,909
in the state. Cotton money. Unlike that of
his own father, the death of Lon Hammond Sr.

731
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:45,659
had made the front page of the newspaper.
“I’ve heard of them. His father built

732
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:49,929
quite a business. Did Lon take over for him?”

733
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:53,909
She shook her head. “No, he’s a lawyer.
He has his own practice downtown.”

734
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:57,060
“With his name, he must be busy.”

735
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,639
“He is. He works a lot.”

736
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,210
He thought he heard something in her tone,
and the next question came automatically.

737
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:09,639
“Does he treat you well?”

738
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:13,910
She didn’t answer right away, as if she
were considering the question for the first

739
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,040
time. Then:

740
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:22,770
“Yes. He’s a good man, Noah. You would
like him.”

741
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:28,830
Her voice was distant when she answered, or
at least he thought it was. Noah wondered

742
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:32,090
if it was just his mind playing tricks on
him.

743
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,720
“How’s your daddy doing?” she asked.

744
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:41,199
Noah took a couple of steps before answering.
“He passed on earlier this year, right after

745
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,389
I got back.”

746
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:47,909
“I’m sorry,” she said softly, knowing
how much he had meant to Noah.

747
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:52,310
He nodded, and the two walked in silence for
a moment.

748
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:57,929
They reached the top of the hill and stopped.
The oak tree was in the distance, with the

749
01:13:57,929 --> 01:14:04,310
sun glowing orange behind it. Allie could
feel his eyes on her as she stared in that

750
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,470
direction.

751
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:09,380
“A lot of memories there, Allie.”

752
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:17,080
She smiled. “I know. I saw it when I came
in. Do you remember the day we spent there?”

753
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:22,199
“Yes,” he answered, volunteering no more.

754
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:24,960
“Do you ever think about it?”

755
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,510
“Sometimes,” he said. “Usually when
I’m working out this way. It sits on my

756
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,710
property now.”

757
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,580
“You bought it?”

758
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:41,179
“I just couldn’t bear to see it turned
into kitchen cabinets.”

759
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:49,230
She laughed under her breath, feeling strangely
pleased about that. “Do you still read poetry?”

760
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:56,010
He nodded. “Yeah. I never stopped. I guess
it’s in my blood.”

761
01:14:56,010 --> 01:15:00,010
“Do you know, you’re the only poet I’ve
ever met.”

762
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:06,520
“I’m no poet. I read, but I can’t write
a verse. I’ve tried.”

763
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:15,140
“You’re still a poet, Noah Taylor Calhoun.”
Her voice softened. “I still think about

764
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:22,429
it a lot. It was the first time anyone ever
read poetry to me before. In fact, it’s

765
01:15:22,429 --> 01:15:25,860
the only time.”

766
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:30,830
Her comment made both of them drift back and
remember as they slowly circled back to the

767
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:37,449
house, following a new path that passed near
the dock. As the sun dropped a little lower

768
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,870
and the sky turned orange, he asked:

769
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:42,510
“So, how long are you staying?”

770
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:46,639
“I don’t know. Not long. Maybe until tomorrow
or the next day.”

771
01:15:46,639 --> 01:15:50,630
“Is your fiancé here on business?”

772
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:59,199
She shook her head. “No, he’s still in
Raleigh.” Noah raised his eyebrows. “Does

773
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:02,120
he know you’re here?”

774
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:10,889
She shook her head again and answered slowly.
“No. I told him I was looking for antiques.

775
01:16:10,889 --> 01:16:15,290
He wouldn’t understand my coming here.”

776
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:21,280
Noah was a little surprised by her answer.
It was one thing to come and visit, but it

777
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:26,110
was an entirely different matter to hide the
truth from her fiancé.

778
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:33,100
“You didn’t have to come here to tell
me you were engaged. You could have written

779
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,700
me instead, or even called.”

780
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:42,610
“I know. But for some reason, I had to do
it in person.”

781
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:43,750
“Why?”

782
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:50,840
She hesitated. “I don’t know . . . ,” she
said, trailing off, and the way she said it

783
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:56,139
made him believe her. The gravel crunched
beneath their feet as they walked in silence

784
01:16:56,139 --> 01:17:00,760
for a few steps. Then he asked:

785
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,770
“Allie, do you love him?”

786
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:13,390
She answered automatically. “Yes, I love
him.” The words hurt. But again, he thought

787
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:21,350
he heard something in her tone, as if she
were saying it to convince herself. He stopped

788
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:28,320
and gently took her shoulders in his hands,
making her face him. The fading sunlight reflected

789
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,469
in her eyes as he spoke.

790
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:37,820
“If you’re happy, Allie, and you love
him, I won’t try to stop you from going

791
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:46,310
back to him. But if there’s a part of you
that isn’t sure, then don’t do it. This

792
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:50,870
isn’t the kind of thing you go into halfway.”

793
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:54,210
Her answer came almost too quickly.

794
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:58,660
“I’m making the right decision, Noah.”

795
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:05,010
He stared for a second, wondering if he believed
her. Then he nodded and the two began to walk

796
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:12,500
again. After a moment he said: “I’m not
making this easy for you, am I?”

797
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:18,020
She smiled a little. “It’s okay. I really
can’t blame you.”

798
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,120
“I’m sorry anyway.”

799
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:26,061
“Don’t be. There’s no reason to be sorry.
I’m the one who should be apologizing. Maybe

800
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:29,030
I should have written.”

801
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:35,870
He shook his head. “To be honest, I’m
still glad you came. Despite everything. It’s

802
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,560
good to see you again.”

803
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,739
“Thank you, Noah.”

804
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:48,100
“Do you think it would be possible to start
over?”

805
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,910
She looked at him curiously.

806
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:56,429
“You were the best friend I ever had, Allie.
I’d still like to be friends, even if you

807
01:18:56,429 --> 01:19:02,870
are engaged, and even if it is just for a
couple of days. How about we just kind of

808
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:07,139
get to know each other again?”

809
01:19:07,139 --> 01:19:12,219
She thought about it, thought about staying
or leaving, and decided that since he knew

810
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:19,320
about her engagement, it would probably be
all right. Or at least not wrong. She smiled

811
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,080
slightly and nodded.

812
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,820
“I’d like that.”

813
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:28,670
“Good. How about dinner? I know a place
that serves the best crab in town.”

814
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,909
“Sounds great. Where?”

815
01:19:30,909 --> 01:19:35,639
“My house. I’ve had the traps out all
week, and I saw that I had some good ones

816
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:39,219
caged a couple days ago. Do you mind?”

817
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:42,929
“No, that sounds fine.”

818
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:46,660
He smiled and pointed over his shoulder with
his thumb. “Great. They’re at the dock.

819
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,909
I’ll just be a couple of minutes.”

820
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:55,159
Allie watched him walk away and noticed the
tension she’d felt when telling him about

821
01:19:55,159 --> 01:20:01,670
her engagement was beginning to fade. Closing
her eyes, she ran her hands through her hair

822
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:08,230
and let the light breeze fan her cheek. She
took a deep breath and held it for a moment,

823
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:14,010
feeling the muscles in her shoulders further
relax as she exhaled. Finally, opening her

824
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:18,659
eyes, she stared at the beauty that surrounded
her.

825
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:24,170
She always loved evenings like this, evenings
where the faint aroma of autumn leaves rode

826
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:32,131
on the backs of soft southern winds. She loved
the trees and the sounds they made. Listening

827
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:38,560
to them helped her relax even more. After
a moment, she turned toward Noah and looked

828
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,159
at him almost as a stranger might.

829
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:49,560
God, he looked good. Even after all this time.
She watched him as he reached for a rope that

830
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,640
hung in the water. He began to pull it, and
despite the darkening sky, she saw the muscles

831
01:20:54,640 --> 01:21:00,449
in his arm flex as he lifted the cage from
the water. He let it hang over the river for

832
01:21:00,449 --> 01:21:06,140
a moment and shook it, letting most of the
water escape. After setting the trap on the

833
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:12,560
dock, he opened it and began to remove the
crabs one by one, placing them into a bucket.

834
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,480
She started walking toward him then, listening
to the crickets chirp, and remembered a lesson

835
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:24,570
from childhood. She counted the number of
chirps in a minute and added twenty-nine.

836
01:21:24,570 --> 01:21:30,530
Sixty-seven degrees, she thought as she smiled
to herself. She didn’t know if it was accurate,

837
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:33,370
but it felt about right.

838
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:39,600
As she walked, she looked around and realized
she had forgotten how fresh and beautiful

839
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:45,290
everything seemed here. Over her shoulder,
she saw the house in the distance. He had

840
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:49,639
left a couple of lights on, and it seemed
to be the only house around. At least the

841
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:55,739
only one with electricity. Out here, outside
the town limits, nothing was certain. Thousands

842
01:21:55,739 --> 01:22:00,680
of country homes still lacked the luxury of
indoor lighting.

843
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,990
She stepped on the dock and it creaked under
her foot. The sound reminded her of a rusty

844
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:11,530
squeeze-box, and Noah glanced up and winked,
then went back to checking the crabs, making

845
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:17,670
sure they were the right size. She walked
to the rocker that sat on the dock and touched

846
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:26,040
it, running her hand along the back. She could
picture him sitting in it, fishing, thinking,

847
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:32,850
reading. It was old and weather-beaten, rough
feeling. She wondered how much time he spent

848
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:38,130
here alone, and she wondered about his thoughts
at times like those.

849
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:46,590
“It was my daddy’s chair,” he said,
not looking up, and she nodded. She saw bats

850
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:52,409
in the sky, and frogs had joined the crickets
in their evening harmony.

851
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:57,909
She walked to the other side of the dock,
feeling a sense of closure. A compulsion had

852
01:22:57,909 --> 01:23:03,659
driven her here, and for the first time in
three weeks the feeling was gone. She’d

853
01:23:03,659 --> 01:23:10,810
somehow needed Noah to know about her engagement,
to understand, to accept it—she was sure

854
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:16,620
of that now—and while thinking of him, she
was reminded of something they’d shared

855
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:23,850
from the summer they were together. With head
down, she paced around slowly, looking for

856
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:34,739
it until she found it—the carving. Noah
loves Allie, in a heart. Carved into the dock

857
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:38,250
a few days before she’d left.

858
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:44,720
A breeze broke the stillness and chilled her,
making her cross her arms. She stood that

859
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,199
way, alternately looking down at the carving
and then toward the river, until she heard

860
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:54,380
him reach her side. She could feel his closeness,
his warmth, as she spoke.

861
01:23:54,380 --> 01:24:00,960
“It’s so peaceful here,” she said, her
voice dreamlike.

862
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,870
“I know. I come down here a lot now just
to be close to the water. It makes me feel

863
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:07,870
good.”

864
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,860
“I would, too, if I were you.”

865
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:17,810
“Come on, let’s go. The mosquitoes are
getting vicious, and I’m starved.”

866
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:24,500
The sky had turned black, and Noah started
toward the house, Allie right beside him.

867
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,560
In the silence her mind wandered, and she
felt a little light-headed as she walked along

868
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:34,159
the path. She wondered what he was thinking
about her being here and wasn’t exactly

869
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,671
sure if she knew herself. When they reached
the house a couple of minutes later, Clem

870
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:44,679
greeted them with a wet nose in the wrong
place. Noah motioned her away, and she left

871
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:48,160
with her tail between her legs.

872
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,910
He pointed to her car. “Did you leave anything
in there that you need to get out?”

873
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:59,080
“No, I got in earlier and unpacked already.”
Her voice sounded different to her, as if

874
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,260
the years had suddenly been undone.

875
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:06,910
“Good enough,” he said as he reached the
back porch and started up the steps. He set

876
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:12,219
the bucket by the door, then led the way inside,
heading toward the kitchen. It was on the

877
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:18,280
immediate right, large and smelling of new
wood. The cabinets had been done in oak, as

878
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:23,660
was the floor, and the windows were large
and faced east, allowing the light from morning

879
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:31,510
sun. It was a tasteful restoration, not overdone
as was common when homes like this were rebuilt.

880
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:33,420
“Do you mind if I look around?”

881
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:39,850
“No, go ahead. I did some shopping earlier,
and I still have to put the groceries away.”

882
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:45,530
Their eyes met for a second, and Allie knew
as she turned that he continued to watch her

883
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:53,860
as she left the room. Inside she felt that
little twitch again.

884
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,380
She toured the house for the next few minutes,
walking through the rooms, noticing how wonderful

885
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:04,659
it looked. By the time she’d finished, it
was hard to remember how run-down it had been.

886
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:10,480
She came down the stairs, turned toward the
kitchen, and saw his profile. For a second

887
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,889
he looked like a young man of seventeen again,
and it made her pause a split second before

888
01:26:15,889 --> 01:26:24,840
going on. Damn, she thought, get a hold of
yourself. Remember that you’re engaged now.

889
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,500
He was standing by the counter, a couple of
cabinet doors open wide, empty grocery bags

890
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:34,770
on the floor, whistling quietly. He smiled
at her before putting a few more cans into

891
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:39,949
one of the cabinets. She stopped a few feet
from him and leaned against the counter, one

892
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:45,179
leg over the other. She shook her head, amazed
at how much he had done.

893
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:50,949
“It’s unbelievable, Noah. How long did
the restoration take?”

894
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:55,130
He looked up from the last bag he was unpacking.
“Almost a year.”

895
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:57,830
“Did you do it yourself?”

896
01:26:57,830 --> 01:27:01,929
He laughed under his breath. “No. I always
thought I would when I was young, and I started

897
01:27:01,929 --> 01:27:07,310
that way. But it was just too much. It would
have taken years, and so I ended up hiring

898
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:11,470
some people . . . actually a lot of people.
But even with them, it was still a lot of

899
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:14,830
work, and most of the time I didn’t stop
until past midnight.”

900
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:18,969
“Why’d you work so hard?”

901
01:27:18,969 --> 01:27:22,969
Ghosts, he wanted to say, but didn’t.

902
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:28,790
“I don’t know. Just wanted to finish,
I guess. Do you want anything to drink before

903
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,400
I start dinner?”

904
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,540
“What do you have?”

905
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,750
“Not much, really. Beer, tea, coffee.”

906
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,360
“Tea sounds good.”

907
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,800
He gathered the grocery bags and put them
away, then walked to a small room off the

908
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,639
kitchen before returning with a box of tea.
He pulled out a couple of teabags and set

909
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:51,670
them by the stove, then filled the teapot.
After putting it on the burner, he lit a match,

910
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,710
and she heard the sound of flames as they
came to life.

911
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:59,890
“It’ll be just a minute,” he said. “This
stove heats up pretty quick.”

912
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:02,119
“That’s fine.”

913
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:06,270
When the teapot whistled, he poured two cups
and handed one to her.

914
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:12,220
She smiled and took a sip, then motioned toward
the window. “I’ll bet the kitchen is beautiful

915
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,880
when the morning light shines in.”

916
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,940
He nodded. “It is. I had larger windows
put in on this side of the house for just

917
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:22,310
that reason. Even in the bedrooms upstairs.”

918
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:29,560
“I’m sure your guests enjoy that. Unless
of course they want to sleep late.”

919
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:37,239
“Actually, I haven’t had any guests stay
over yet. Since my daddy passed on, I don’t

920
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:41,190
really know who to invite.”

921
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:48,000
By his tone, she knew he was just making conversation.
Yet for some reason it made her feel . . . lonely.

922
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,630
He seemed to realize how she was feeling,
but before she could dwell on it, he changed

923
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:54,630
the subject.

924
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:58,660
“I’m going to get the crabs in to marinate
for a few minutes before I steam ’em,”

925
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:03,389
he said, putting his cup on the counter. He
went to the cupboard and removed a large pot

926
01:29:03,389 --> 01:29:07,560
with a steamer and lid. He brought the pot
to the sink, added water, then carried it

927
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,800
to the stove.

928
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,760
“Can I give you a hand with something?”

929
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,219
He answered over his shoulder. “Sure. How
about cutting up some vegetables for the fryer.

930
01:29:15,219 --> 01:29:20,100
There’s plenty in the icebox, and you can
find a bowl over there.”

931
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,760
He motioned to the cabinet near the sink,
and she took another sip of tea before setting

932
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,830
her cup on the counter and retrieving the
bowl. She carried it to the icebox and found

933
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:34,429
some okra, zucchini, onions, and carrots on
the bottom shelf. Noah joined her in front

934
01:29:34,429 --> 01:29:43,469
of the open door, and she moved to make room
for him. She could smell him as he stood next

935
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:47,650
to her— clean, familiar, distinctive—and
felt his arm brush against her as he leaned

936
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:53,070
over and reached inside. He removed a beer
and a bottle of hot sauce, then returned to

937
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,580
the stove.

938
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:59,389
Noah opened the beer and poured it in the
water, then added the hot sauce and some other

939
01:29:59,389 --> 01:30:04,580
seasoning as well. After stirring the water
to make sure the powders were dissolved, he

940
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:06,630
went to the back door to get the crabs.

941
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:13,159
He paused for a moment before going back inside
and stared at Allie, watching her cut the

942
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:20,369
carrots. As he did that, he wondered again
why she had come, especially now that she

943
01:30:20,369 --> 01:30:25,429
was engaged. None of this seemed to make much
sense to him.

944
01:30:25,429 --> 01:30:30,870
But then, Allie had always been surprising.

945
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:38,570
He smiled to himself, remembering back to
the way she had been. Fiery, spontaneous,

946
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:46,489
passionate—as he imagined most artists to
be. And she was definitely that. Artistic

947
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:53,660
talent like hers was a gift. He remembered
seeing some paintings in the museums in New

948
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:59,640
York and thinking that her work was just as
good as what he had seen there.

949
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:04,660
She had given him a painting before she’d
left that summer. It hung above the fireplace

950
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:10,850
in the living room. She’d called it a picture
of her dreams, and to him it had seemed extremely

951
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:16,800
sensual. When he looked at it, and he often
did late in the evening, he could see desire

952
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:23,159
in the colors and the lines, and if he focused
carefully, he could imagine what she had been

953
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:25,650
thinking with every stroke.

954
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:31,739
A dog barked in the distance, and Noah realized
he had been standing with the door open a

955
01:31:31,739 --> 01:31:37,870
long time. He quickly closed it, turning back
to the kitchen. And as he walked, he wondered

956
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:41,030
if she had noticed how long he’d been gone.

957
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:49,179
“How’s it going?” he asked, seeing she
was almost finished.

958
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:52,390
“Good. I’m almost done here. Anything
else for dinner?”

959
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:55,450
“I have some homemade bread that I was planning
on.”

960
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:56,450
“Homemade?”

961
01:31:56,450 --> 01:32:01,420
“From a neighbor,” he said as he put the
pail in the sink. He started the faucet and

962
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:05,560
began to rinse the crabs, holding them under
the water, then letting them scurry around

963
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,800
the sink while he rinsed the next one. Allie
picked up her cup and came over to watch him.

964
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,489
“Aren’t you afraid they’ll pinch you
when you grab them?”

965
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:19,520
“No. Just grab ’em like this,” he said,
demonstrating, and she smiled.

966
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,230
“I forget you’ve done this your whole
life.” “New Bern’s small, but it does

967
01:32:24,230 --> 01:32:27,860
teach you how to do the things that matter.”

968
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:33,430
She leaned against the counter, standing close
to him, and emptied her cup. When the crabs

969
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:38,540
were ready he put them in the pot on the stove.
He washed his hands, turning to speak to her

970
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,540
as he did so.

971
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:43,550
“You want to sit on the porch for a few
minutes? I’d like to let ’em soak for

972
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:45,000
a half hour.”

973
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,150
“Sure,” she said.

974
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:53,830
He wiped his hands, and together they went
to the back porch. Noah flipped on the light

975
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:59,409
as they went outside, and he sat in the older
rocker, offering the newer one to her. When

976
01:32:59,409 --> 01:33:03,560
he saw her cup was empty, he went inside for
a moment and emerged with another cup of tea

977
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:09,260
and a beer for himself. He held out the cup
and she took it, sipping again before she

978
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:12,460
set it on the table beside the chairs.

979
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:17,000
“You were sitting out here when I came,
weren’t you?”

980
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,619
He answered as he made himself comfortable.
“Yeah. I sit out here every night. It’s

981
01:33:21,619 --> 01:33:23,030
a habit now.”

982
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:31,469
“I can see why,” she said as she looked
around. “So, what is it you do these days?”

983
01:33:31,469 --> 01:33:38,050
“Actually, I don’t do anything but work
on the house right now. It satisfies my creative

984
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,050
urges.”

985
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:41,369
“How can you ...I mean . . .”

986
01:33:41,369 --> 01:33:43,040
“Morris Goldman.”

987
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,719
“Excuse me?”

988
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:50,239
He smiled. “My old boss from up north. His
name was Morris Goldman. He offered me a part

989
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:55,810
of the business just as I enlisted and died
before I got home. When I got back to the

990
01:33:55,810 --> 01:34:01,239
States, his lawyers gave me a check big enough
to buy this place and fix it up.”

991
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:07,580
She laughed under her breath. “You always
told me you’d find a way to do it.”

992
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:14,320
They both sat quietly for a moment, thinking
back again. Allie took another sip of tea.

993
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:22,300
“Do you remember sneaking over here the
night you first told me about this place?”

994
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,860
He nodded, and she went on:

995
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:30,850
“I got home a little late that evening,
and my parents were furious when I finally

996
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:36,110
came in. I can still picture my daddy standing
in the living room smoking a cigarette, my

997
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:40,850
mother on the sofa staring straight ahead.
I swear, they looked as if a family member

998
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:46,480
had died. That was the first time my parents
knew I was serious about you, and my mother

999
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:51,090
had a long talk with me later that night.
She said to me, ‘I’m sure you think that

1000
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:55,540
I don’t understand what you’re going through,
but I do. It’s just that sometimes, our

1001
01:34:55,540 --> 01:35:04,699
future is dictated by what we are, as opposed
to what we want.’ I remember being really

1002
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,909
hurt when she said that.”

1003
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:15,219
“You told me about it the next day. It hurt
my feelings, too. I liked your parents, and

1004
01:35:15,219 --> 01:35:17,930
I had no idea they didn’t like me.”

1005
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:23,460
“It wasn’t that they didn’t like you.
They didn’t think you deserved me.”

1006
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:27,929
“There’s not much difference.”

1007
01:35:27,929 --> 01:35:35,720
There was a sadness in his voice when he responded,
and she knew he was right to feel that way.

1008
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,780
She looked toward the stars while she ran
her hand through her hair, pulling back the

1009
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:42,659
strands that had fallen onto her face.

1010
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:49,360
“I know that. I always did. Maybe that’s
why my mother and I always seem to have a

1011
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,030
distance between us when we talk.”

1012
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:54,850
“How do you feel about it now?”

1013
01:35:54,850 --> 01:36:03,350
“The same as I did back then. That it’s
wrong, that it isn’t fair. It was a terrible

1014
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:11,050
thing for a girl to learn. That status is
more important than feelings.”

1015
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:14,800
Noah smiled softly at her answer but said
nothing.

1016
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:20,850
“I’ve thought about you ever since that
summer,” she said.

1017
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:22,480
“You have?”

1018
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:28,920
“Why wouldn’t you think so?” She seemed
genuinely surprised.

1019
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,000
“You never answered my letters.”

1020
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,080
“You wrote?”

1021
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:42,830
“Dozens of letters. I wrote you for two
years without receiving a single reply.”

1022
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,230
She slowly shook her head before lowering
her eyes.

1023
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:55,350
“I didn’t know . . . ,” she finally
said, quietly, and he knew it must have been

1024
01:36:55,350 --> 01:37:01,780
her mother, checking the mail, removing the
letters without her knowledge. It was what

1025
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:08,080
he had always suspected, and he watched as
Allie came to the same realization.

1026
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:15,400
“It was wrong of her to do that, Noah, and
I’m sorry she did. But try to understand.

1027
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:22,139
Once I left, she probably thought it would
be easier for me to just let it go. She never

1028
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:27,840
understood how much you meant to me, and to
be honest, I don’t even know if she ever

1029
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:35,460
loved my father the way I loved you. In her
mind, she was just trying to protect my feelings,

1030
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:41,100
and she probably thought the best way to do
that was to hide the letters you sent.”

1031
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:47,199
“That wasn’t her decision to make,”
he said quietly.

1032
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:49,280
“I know.”

1033
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:54,119
“Would it have made a difference even if
you’d got them?”

1034
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:58,719
“Of course. I always wondered what you were
up to.”

1035
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:06,100
“No, I mean with us. Do you think we would
have made it?”

1036
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,870
It took a moment for her to answer.

1037
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:14,940
“I don’t know, Noah. I really don’t,
and you don’t either. We’re not the same

1038
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:20,199
people we were then. We’ve changed, we’ve
grown. Both of us.”

1039
01:38:20,199 --> 01:38:27,470
She paused. He didn’t respond, and in the
silence she looked toward the creek. She went

1040
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,470
on:

1041
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:36,040
“But yes, Noah, I think we would have. At
least, I’d like to think we would have.”

1042
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:43,580
He nodded, looked down, then turned away.
“What’s Lon like?”

1043
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:49,000
She hesitated, not expecting the question.
Bringing up Lon’s name brought slight feelings

1044
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,150
of guilt to the surface, and for a moment
she didn’t know how to answer. She reached

1045
01:38:54,150 --> 01:39:00,410
for her cup, took another sip of tea, and
listened as a woodpecker tapped in the distance.

1046
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:01,930
She spoke quietly.

1047
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:08,869
“Lon’s handsome, charming, and successful,
and most of my friends are insanely jealous.

1048
01:39:08,869 --> 01:39:15,619
They think he’s perfect, and in a lot of
ways he is. He’s kind to me, he makes me

1049
01:39:15,619 --> 01:39:22,920
laugh, and I know he loves me in his own way.”
She paused for a moment, collecting her thoughts.

1050
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:29,970
“But there’s always going to be something
missing in our relationship.”

1051
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:36,170
She surprised herself with her answer but
knew it was true nonetheless. And she also

1052
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:42,949
knew by looking at him that Noah had suspected
the answer in advance.

1053
01:39:42,949 --> 01:39:45,469
“Why?”

1054
01:39:45,469 --> 01:39:51,290
She smiled weakly and shrugged as she answered.
Her voice was barely above a whisper.

1055
01:39:51,290 --> 01:40:01,280
“I guess I still look for the kind of love
we had that summer.”

1056
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:05,800
Noah thought about what she had said for a
long while, thinking about the relationships

1057
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,350
he’d had since he’d last seen her.

1058
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:13,860
“How about you?” she asked. “Did you
ever think about us?”

1059
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:18,420
“All the time. I still do.”

1060
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:22,820
“Are you seeing anyone?”

1061
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:28,310
“No,” he answered, shaking his head.

1062
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:34,190
Both of them seemed to think about that, trying
but finding it impossible to displace from

1063
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:40,489
their minds. Noah finished his beer, surprised
that he had emptied it so quickly.

1064
01:40:40,489 --> 01:40:45,949
“I’m going to go start the water. Can
I get you anything?”

1065
01:40:45,949 --> 01:40:49,620
She shook her head, and Noah went to the kitchen
and put the crabs in the steamer and the bread

1066
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:55,250
in the oven. He found some flour and cornmeal
for the vegetables, coated them, and put some

1067
01:40:55,250 --> 01:41:00,719
grease into the frying pan. After turning
the heat on low, he set a timer and pulled

1068
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:05,659
another beer from the icebox before heading
back to the porch. And while he was doing

1069
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:14,170
those things, he thought about Allie and the
love that was missing from both their lives.

1070
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:23,510
Allie, too, was thinking. About Noah, about
herself, about a lot of things. For a moment

1071
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:31,140
she wished she weren’t engaged but then
quickly cursed herself. It wasn’t Noah she

1072
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:40,300
loved; she loved what they once had been.
Besides, it was normal to feel this way. Her

1073
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:45,929
first real love, the only man she’d ever
been with— how could she expect to forget

1074
01:41:45,929 --> 01:41:48,060
him?

1075
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:56,810
Yet was it normal for her insides to twitch
whenever he came near? Was it normal to confess

1076
01:41:56,810 --> 01:42:04,800
things she could never tell anyone else? Was
it normal to come here three weeks from her

1077
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,570
wedding day?

1078
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:15,090
“No, it’s not,” she finally whispered
to herself as she looked to the evening sky.

1079
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:21,480
“There’s nothing normal about any of this.”

1080
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,860
Noah came out at that moment and she smiled
at him, glad he’d come back so she didn’t

1081
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:30,530
have to think about it anymore. “It’s
going to take a few minutes,” he said as

1082
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:31,929
he sat back down.

1083
01:42:31,929 --> 01:42:37,650
“That’s fine. I’m not that hungry yet.”

1084
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:44,670
He looked at her then, and she saw the softness
in his eyes. “I’m glad you came, Allie,”

1085
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:45,699
he said.

1086
01:42:45,699 --> 01:42:51,239
“Me too. I almost didn’t, though.”

1087
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:55,010
“Why did you come?”

1088
01:42:55,010 --> 01:43:02,330
I was compelled, she wanted to say, but didn’t.
“Just to see you, to find out what you’ve

1089
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:06,719
been up to. To see how you are.”

1090
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:12,960
He wondered if that was all but didn’t question
further. Instead he changed the subject.

1091
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:18,090
“By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask,
do you still paint?”

1092
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:21,000
She shook her head. “Not anymore.”

1093
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,900
He was stunned. “Why not? You have so much
talent.”

1094
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,520
“I don’t know....”

1095
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,369
“Sure you do. You stopped for a reason.”

1096
01:43:31,369 --> 01:43:34,770
He was right. She’d had a reason.

1097
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:37,540
“It’s a long story.”

1098
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:41,450
“I’ve got all night,” he answered.

1099
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:47,790
“Did you really think I was talented?”
she asked quietly.

1100
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:54,770
“C’mon,” he said, reaching for her hand,
“I want to show you something.”

1101
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,830
She got up and followed him through the door
to the living room. He stopped in front of

1102
01:43:58,830 --> 01:44:05,010
the fireplace and pointed to the painting
that hung above the mantel. She gasped, surprised

1103
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:09,260
she hadn’t noticed it earlier, more surprised
it was here at all.

1104
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:10,699
“You kept it?”

1105
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:14,889
“Of course I kept it. It’s wonderful.”

1106
01:44:14,889 --> 01:44:22,260
She gave him a skeptical look, and he explained.
“It makes me feel alive when I look at it.

1107
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:27,969
Sometimes I have to get up and touch it. It’s
just so real— the shapes, the shadows, the

1108
01:44:27,969 --> 01:44:34,810
colors. I even dream about it sometimes. It’s
incredible, Allie—I can stare at it for

1109
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,010
hours.”

1110
01:44:36,010 --> 01:44:39,690
“You’re serious,” she said, shocked.

1111
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,760
“As serious as I’ve ever been.”

1112
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:46,150
She didn’t say anything.

1113
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:49,949
“You mean to tell me no one has ever told
you that before?”

1114
01:44:49,949 --> 01:44:58,430
“My professor did,” she finally said,
“but I guess I didn’t believe him.”

1115
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:03,550
He knew there was more. Allie looked away
before continuing.

1116
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:10,460
“I’ve been drawing and painting since
I was a child. I guess that once I got a little

1117
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:15,810
older, I began to think I was good at it.
I enjoyed it, too. I remember working on this

1118
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:22,820
painting that summer, adding to it every day,
changing it as our relationship changed. I

1119
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:28,260
don’t even remember how it started or what
I wanted it to be, but somehow it evolved

1120
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:29,530
into this.

1121
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:35,139
“I remember being unable to stop painting
after I went home that summer. I think it

1122
01:45:35,139 --> 01:45:41,239
was my way of avoiding the pain I was going
through. Anyway, I ended up majoring in art

1123
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:45,810
in college because it was something I had
to do; I remember spending hours in the studio

1124
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:52,170
all by myself and enjoying every minute. I
loved the freedom I felt when I created, the

1125
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:58,250
way it made me feel inside to make something
beautiful. Just before I graduated, my professor,

1126
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:03,640
who happened to also be the critic for the
paper, told me I had a lot of talent. He told

1127
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:10,250
me I should try my luck as an artist. But
I didn’t listen to him.”

1128
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:13,320
She stopped there, gathering her thoughts.

1129
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:19,750
“My parents didn’t think it was proper
for someone like me to paint for a living.

1130
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:27,000
I just stopped after a while. I haven’t
touched a brush in years.”

1131
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,080
She stared at the painting.

1132
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,650
“Do you think you’ll ever paint again?”

1133
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:38,670
“I’m not sure if I can anymore. It’s
been a long time.”

1134
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:45,580
“You can still do it, Allie. I know you
can. You have a talent that comes from inside

1135
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:50,179
you, from your heart, not from your fingers.
What you have can’t ever go away. It’s

1136
01:46:50,179 --> 01:46:56,119
what other people only dream about. You’re
an artist, Allie.”

1137
01:46:56,119 --> 01:47:01,429
The words were spoken with such sincerity
that she knew he wasn’t saying it just to

1138
01:47:01,429 --> 01:47:07,080
be nice. He truly believed in her ability,
and for some reason that meant more to her

1139
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:15,230
than she expected. But something else happened
then, something even more powerful.

1140
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:21,920
Why it happened, she never knew, but this
was when the chasm began to close for Allie,

1141
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:28,730
the chasm she had erected in her life to separate
the pain from the pleasure. And she suspected

1142
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:35,690
then, maybe not consciously, that there was
more to this than even she cared to admit.

1143
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:40,630
But at that moment she still wasn’t completely
aware of it, and she turned to face him. She

1144
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:47,190
reached over and touched his hand, hesitantly,
gently, amazed that after all these years

1145
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:54,900
he’d somehow known exactly what she’d
needed to hear. When their eyes locked, she

1146
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:59,790
once again realized how special he was.

1147
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:07,640
And for just a fleeting moment, a tiny wisp
of time that hung in the air like fireflies

1148
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:20,140
in summer skies, she wondered if she was in
love with him again.

1149
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:26,199
The timer went off in the kitchen, a small
ding, and Noah turned away, breaking the moment,

1150
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:32,159
strangely affected by what had just happened
between them. Her eyes had spoken to him and

1151
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:39,030
whispered something he longed to hear, yet
he couldn’t stop the voice inside his head,

1152
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:46,350
her voice, that had told him of her love for
another man. He silently cursed the timer

1153
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:52,020
as he walked to the kitchen and removed the
bread from the oven. He almost burned his

1154
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:56,100
fingers, dropped the loaf on the counter,
and saw that the frying pan was ready. He

1155
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:00,830
added the vegetables and heard them begin
to crackle. Then, muttering to himself, he

1156
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:05,369
got some butter out of the icebox, spread
some on the bread, and melted a bit more for

1157
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:07,670
the crabs.

1158
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,330
Allie had followed him into the kitchen and
cleared her throat.

1159
01:49:10,330 --> 01:49:13,000
“Can I get the table ready?”

1160
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,679
Noah used the bread knife as a pointer. “Sure,
plates are over there. Utensils and napkins

1161
01:49:18,679 --> 01:49:24,010
there. Make sure you get plenty—crabs can
be messy, so we’ll need ’em.” He couldn’t

1162
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:29,630
look at her as he spoke. He didn’t want
to realize he’d been mistaken about what

1163
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:34,520
had just happened between them. He didn’t
want it to be a mistake.

1164
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:40,720
Allie, too, was wondering about the moment
and feeling warm as she thought of it. The

1165
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:45,739
words he’d spoken replayed in her head as
she found everything she needed for the table:

1166
01:49:45,739 --> 01:49:50,880
plates, place settings, salt and pepper. Noah
handed her the bread as she was finishing

1167
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,580
the table, and their fingers touched briefly.

1168
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:59,199
He turned his attention back to the frying
pan and turned the vegetables. He lifted the

1169
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:04,489
lid of the steamer, saw the crabs still had
a minute, and let them cook some more. He

1170
01:50:04,489 --> 01:50:10,369
was more composed now and returned to small
talk, easy conversation.

1171
01:50:10,369 --> 01:50:13,110
“Have you ever had crab before?”

1172
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:15,510
“A couple of times. But only in salads.”

1173
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:21,560
He laughed. “Then you’re in for an adventure.
Hold on a second.” He disappeared upstairs

1174
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:26,400
for a moment, then returned with a navy blue
button-down shirt. He held it open for her.

1175
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:30,250
“Here, put this on. I don’t want you to
stain your dress.”

1176
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:35,760
Allie put it on and smelled the fragrance
that lingered in the shirt—his smell, distinctive,

1177
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:36,760
natural.

1178
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:41,910
“Don’t worry,” he said, seeing her expression,
“it’s clean.”

1179
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:47,510
She laughed. “I know. It just reminds me
of our first real date. You gave me your jacket

1180
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:49,390
that night, remember?”

1181
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:55,590
He nodded. “Yeah, I remember. Fin and Sarah
were with us. Fin kept elbowing me the whole

1182
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:59,560
way back to your parents’ house, trying
to get me to hold your hand.”

1183
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:00,900
“You didn’t, though.”

1184
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,900
“No,” he answered, shaking his head.

1185
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:03,900
“Why not?”

1186
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:08,000
“Shy, maybe, or afraid. I don’t know.
It just didn’t seem like the right thing

1187
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,590
to do at the time.”

1188
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:13,590
“Come to think of it, you were kind of shy,
weren’t you.”

1189
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:22,119
“I prefer the words ‘quiet confidence,’”
he answered with a wink, and she smiled.

1190
01:51:22,119 --> 01:51:26,949
The vegetables and crabs were ready about
the same time. “Be careful, they’re hot,”

1191
01:51:26,949 --> 01:51:31,310
he said as he handed them to her, and they
sat across from each other at the small wooden

1192
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:36,900
table. Then, realizing the tea was still on
the counter, Allie stood and brought it over.

1193
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:41,889
After putting some vegetables and bread on
their plates, Noah added a crab, and Allie

1194
01:51:41,889 --> 01:51:44,469
sat for a moment, staring at it.

1195
01:51:44,469 --> 01:51:46,540
“It looks like a bug.”

1196
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:51,770
“A good bug, though,” he said. “Here,
let me show you how it’s done.”

1197
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:57,639
He demonstrated quickly, making it look easy,
removing the meat and putting it on her plate.

1198
01:51:57,639 --> 01:52:01,810
Allie crushed the legs too hard the first
time and the time after that, and had to use

1199
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:07,310
her fingers to get the shells away from the
meat. She felt clumsy at first, worrying that

1200
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:14,010
he saw every mistake, but then she realized
her own insecurity. He didn’t care about

1201
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:17,550
things like that. He never had.

1202
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:22,560
“So, whatever happened to Fin?” she asked.

1203
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,550
It took a second for him to answer.

1204
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:28,699
“Fin died in the war. His destroyer was
torpedoed in forty-three.”

1205
01:52:28,699 --> 01:52:34,949
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I know he
was a good friend of yours.”

1206
01:52:34,949 --> 01:52:38,000
His voice changed, a little deeper now.

1207
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,460
“He was. I think of him a lot these days.
I especially remember the last time I saw

1208
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:50,320
him. I’d come home to say good-bye before
I enlisted, and we ran into each other again.

1209
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,139
He was a banker here, like his daddy was,
and he and I spent a lot of time together

1210
01:52:54,139 --> 01:53:00,139
over the next week. Sometimes I think I talked
him into joining. I don’t think he would

1211
01:53:00,139 --> 01:53:02,300
have, except that I was going to.”

1212
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:08,119
“That’s not fair,” she said, sorry she’d
brought up the subject.

1213
01:53:08,119 --> 01:53:11,810
“You’re right. I just miss him, is all.”

1214
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:14,290
“I liked him, too. He made me laugh.”

1215
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:17,650
“He was always good at that.”

1216
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:22,250
She looked at him slyly. “He had a crush
on me, you know.”

1217
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,489
“I know. He told me about it.”

1218
01:53:24,489 --> 01:53:26,900
“He did? What did he say?”

1219
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:32,410
Noah shrugged. “The usual for him. That
he had to fight you off with a stick. That

1220
01:53:32,410 --> 01:53:35,840
you chased him constantly, that sort of thing.”

1221
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,849
She laughed quietly. “Did you believe him?”

1222
01:53:38,849 --> 01:53:45,619
“Of course,” he answered, “why wouldn’t
I?” “You men always stick together,”

1223
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:51,530
she said as she reached across the table,
poking his arm with her finger. She went on.

1224
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:58,280
“So, tell me everything you’ve been up
to since I saw you last.”

1225
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:04,470
They started to talk then, making up for lost
time. Noah talked about leaving New Bern,

1226
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:09,599
about working in the shipyard and at the scrap
yard in New Jersey. He spoke fondly of Morris

1227
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:14,929
Goldman and touched on the war a little, avoiding
most of the details, and told her about his

1228
01:54:14,929 --> 01:54:20,531
father and how much he missed him. Allie talked
about going to college, painting, and her

1229
01:54:20,531 --> 01:54:26,440
hours spent volunteering at the hospital.
She talked about her family and friends and

1230
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:31,500
the charities she was involved with. Neither
of them brought up anybody they had dated

1231
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:36,690
since they’d last seen each other. Even
Lon was ignored, and though both of them noticed

1232
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:40,180
the omission, neither mentioned it.

1233
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:45,511
Afterward Allie tried to remember the last
time she and Lon had talked this way. Although

1234
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:52,540
he listened well and they seldom argued, he
was not the type of man to talk like this.

1235
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:57,810
Like her father, he wasn’t comfortable sharing
his thoughts and feelings. She’d tried to

1236
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:04,210
explain that she needed to be closer to him,
but it had never seemed to make a difference.

1237
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:10,280
But sitting here now, she realized what she’d
been missing.

1238
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:17,500
The sky grew darker and the moon rose higher
as the evening wore on. And without either

1239
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:26,429
of them being conscious of it, they began
to regain the intimacy, the bond of familiarity,

1240
01:55:26,429 --> 01:55:29,620
they had once shared.

1241
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:39,360
They finished dinner, both pleased with the
meal, neither talking much now. Noah looked

1242
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:44,850
at his watch and saw that it was getting late.
The stars were out in full, the crickets a

1243
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:51,030
little quieter. He had enjoyed talking to
Allie and wondered if he’d talked too much,

1244
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:56,099
wondered what she’d thought about his life,
hoping it would somehow make a difference,

1245
01:55:56,099 --> 01:55:59,199
if it could.

1246
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:03,770
Noah got up and refilled the teapot. They
both brought the dishes to the sink and cleaned

1247
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:08,989
up the table, and he poured two more cups
of hot water, adding teabags to both.

1248
01:56:08,989 --> 01:56:15,070
“How about the porch again?” he asked,
handing her the cup, and she agreed, leading

1249
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:21,329
the way. He grabbed a quilt for her in case
she got cold, and soon they had taken their

1250
01:56:21,329 --> 01:56:27,659
places again, the quilt over her legs, rockers
moving. Noah watched her from the corner of

1251
01:56:27,659 --> 01:56:36,949
his eye. God, she’s beautiful, he thought.
And inside, he ached.

1252
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:47,060
For something had happened during dinner.
Quite simply, he had fallen in love again.

1253
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:55,820
He knew that now as they sat next to one another.
Fallen in love with a new Allie, not just

1254
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:58,409
her memory.

1255
01:56:58,409 --> 01:57:05,050
But then, he had never really stopped, and
this, he realized, was his destiny.

1256
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:10,989
“It’s been quite a night,” he said,
his voice softer now.

1257
01:57:10,989 --> 01:57:20,900
“Yes, it has,” she said, “a wonderful
night.” Noah turned to the stars, their

1258
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:26,870
twinkling lights reminding him that she would
be leaving soon, and he felt almost empty

1259
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:32,829
inside. This was a night he wanted never to
end. How should he tell her? What could he

1260
01:57:32,829 --> 01:57:36,310
say that would make her stay?

1261
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:43,929
He didn’t know. And thus the decision was
made to say nothing. And he realized then

1262
01:57:43,929 --> 01:57:47,180
that he had failed.

1263
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:55,280
The rockers moved in quiet rhythm. Bats again,
over the river. Moths kissing the porch light.

1264
01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:00,170
Somewhere, he knew, there were people making
love.

1265
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:09,080
“Talk to me,” she finally said, her voice
sensual. Or was his mind playing tricks?

1266
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,750
“What should I say?”

1267
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:21,739
“Talk like you did to me under the oak tree.”
And he did, reciting distant passages, toasting

1268
01:58:21,739 --> 01:58:28,600
the night. Whitman and Thomas, because he
loved the images. Tennyson and Browning, because

1269
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:32,550
their themes felt so familiar.

1270
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:37,060
She rested her head against the back of the
rocker, closing her eyes, growing just a bit

1271
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:43,810
warmer by the time he’d finished. It wasn’t
just the poems or his voice that did it. It

1272
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:50,079
was all of it, the whole greater than the
sum of the parts. She didn’t try to break

1273
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:56,210
it down, didn’t want to, because it wasn’t
meant to be listened to that way. Poetry,

1274
01:58:56,210 --> 01:59:01,980
she thought, wasn’t written to be analyzed;
it was meant to inspire without reason, to

1275
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:06,139
touch without understanding.

1276
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:10,060
Because of him, she’d gone to a few poetry
readings offered by the English department

1277
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:16,350
while in college. She’d sat and listened
to different people, different poems, but

1278
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:22,990
had stopped soon after, discouraged that no
one inspired her or seemed as inspired as

1279
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:26,900
true lovers of poetry should be.

1280
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:34,720
They rocked for a while, drinking tea, sitting
quietly, drifting in their thoughts. The compulsion

1281
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:40,870
that had driven her here was gone now—she
was glad for this—but she worried about

1282
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:47,370
the feelings that had taken its place, the
stirrings that had begun to sift and swirl

1283
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:54,560
in her pores like gold dust in river pans.
She’d tried to deny them, hide from them,

1284
01:59:54,560 --> 02:00:01,520
but now she realized that she didn’t want
them to stop. It had been years since she’d

1285
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,889
felt this way.

1286
02:00:03,889 --> 02:00:10,179
Lon could not evoke these feelings in her.
He never had and probably never would. Maybe

1287
02:00:10,179 --> 02:00:14,971
that was why she had never been to bed with
him. He had tried before, many times, using

1288
02:00:14,971 --> 02:00:20,639
everything from flowers to guilt, and she
had always used the excuse that she wanted

1289
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:29,099
to wait until marriage. He took it well, usually,
and she sometimes wondered how hurt he would

1290
02:00:29,099 --> 02:00:32,850
be if he ever found out about Noah.

1291
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:38,080
But there was something else that made her
want to wait, and it had to do with Lon himself.

1292
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:45,909
He was driven in his work, and it always commanded
most of his attention. Work came first, and

1293
02:00:45,909 --> 02:00:53,090
for him there was no time for poems and wasted
evenings and rocking on porches. She knew

1294
02:00:53,090 --> 02:01:00,310
this was why he was successful, and part of
her respected him for that. But she also sensed

1295
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:08,080
it wasn’t enough. She wanted something else,
something different, something more. Passion

1296
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:16,159
and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations
in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as

1297
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:19,719
simple as not being second.

1298
02:01:19,719 --> 02:01:28,429
Noah, too, was sifting through his thoughts.
To him, the evening would be remembered as

1299
02:01:28,429 --> 02:01:35,230
one of the most special times he had ever
had. As he rocked, he remembered it all in

1300
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:43,280
detail, then remembered it again. Everything
she had done seemed somehow electric to him,

1301
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,889
charged.

1302
02:01:44,889 --> 02:01:51,820
Now, sitting beside her, he wondered if she’d
ever dreamed the same things he had in the

1303
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:56,949
years they’d been apart. Had she ever dreamed
of them holding each other again and kissing

1304
02:01:56,949 --> 02:02:03,460
in soft moonlight? Or did she go further and
dream of their naked bodies, which had been

1305
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:07,739
kept separate for far too long. . . .

1306
02:02:07,739 --> 02:02:13,060
He looked to the stars and remembered the
thousands of empty nights he had spent since

1307
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:19,230
they’d last seen each other. Seeing her
again brought all those feelings to the surface,

1308
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:25,230
and he found it impossible to press them back
down. He knew then he wanted to make love

1309
02:02:25,230 --> 02:02:33,929
to her again and to have her love in return.
It was what he needed most in the world.

1310
02:02:33,929 --> 02:02:40,500
But he also realized it could never be. Now
that she was engaged.

1311
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:48,160
Allie knew by his silence that he was thinking
about her and found that she reveled in it.

1312
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:52,469
She didn’t know what his thoughts were exactly,
didn’t care really, just knew they were

1313
02:02:52,469 --> 02:02:57,030
about her and that was enough.

1314
02:02:57,030 --> 02:03:03,449
She thought about their conversation at dinner
and wondered about loneliness. For some reason

1315
02:03:03,449 --> 02:03:08,969
she couldn’t picture him reading poetry
to someone else or even sharing his dreams

1316
02:03:08,969 --> 02:03:13,639
with another woman. He didn’t seem the type.
Either that, or she didn’t want to believe

1317
02:03:13,639 --> 02:03:15,340
it.

1318
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:21,929
She put down the tea, then ran her hands through
her hair, closing her eyes as she did so.

1319
02:03:21,929 --> 02:03:28,760
“Are you tired?” he asked, finally breaking
free from his thoughts.

1320
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:33,960
“A little. I should really be going in a
couple of minutes.”

1321
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:40,219
“I know,” he said, nodding, his tone neutral.

1322
02:03:40,219 --> 02:03:44,449
She didn’t get up right away. Instead she
picked up the cup and drank the last swallow

1323
02:03:44,449 --> 02:03:52,309
of tea, feeling it warm her throat. She took
the evening in. Moon higher now, wind in the

1324
02:03:52,309 --> 02:03:55,909
trees, temperature dropping.

1325
02:03:55,909 --> 02:04:01,940
She looked at Noah next. The scar on his face
was visible from the side. She wondered if

1326
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:08,329
it had happened during the war, then wondered
if he’d ever been wounded at all. He hadn’t

1327
02:04:08,329 --> 02:04:12,450
mentioned it and she hadn’t asked, mostly
because she didn’t want to imagine him being

1328
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:13,579
hurt.

1329
02:04:13,579 --> 02:04:20,139
“I should go,” she finally said, handing
the quilt back to him.

1330
02:04:20,139 --> 02:04:26,820
Noah nodded, then stood without a word. He
carried the quilt, and the two of them walked

1331
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:33,219
to her car while fallen leaves crunched beneath
their feet. She started to take off the shirt

1332
02:04:33,219 --> 02:04:36,130
he’d loaned her as he opened the door, but
he stopped her.

1333
02:04:36,130 --> 02:04:42,329
“Keep it,” he said. “I want you to have
it.”

1334
02:04:42,329 --> 02:04:49,579
She didn’t ask why, because she wanted to
keep it, too. She readjusted it and crossed

1335
02:04:49,579 --> 02:04:54,440
her arms afterward to ward off the chill.
For some reason, as she stood there she was

1336
02:04:54,440 --> 02:05:00,180
reminded of standing on her front porch after
a high school dance, waiting for a kiss.

1337
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:06,590
“I had a great time tonight,” he said.
“Thank you for finding me.”

1338
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:11,300
“I did, too,” she answered.

1339
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:16,210
He summoned his courage. “Will I see you
tomorrow?”

1340
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:23,530
A simple question. She knew what the answer
should be, especially if she wanted to keep

1341
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:31,230
her life simple. “I don’t think we should,”
was all she had to say, and it would end right

1342
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:36,540
here and now. But for a second she didn’t
say anything.

1343
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:43,810
The demon of choice confronted her then, teased
her, challenged her. Why couldn’t she say

1344
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:49,230
it? She didn’t know. But as she looked in
his eyes to find the answer she needed, she

1345
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:55,739
saw the man she’d once fallen in love with,
and suddenly it all came clear.

1346
02:05:55,739 --> 02:05:59,159
“I’d like that.”

1347
02:05:59,159 --> 02:06:04,909
Noah was surprised. He hadn’t expected her
to answer this way. He wanted to touch her

1348
02:06:04,909 --> 02:06:07,699
then, to take her in his arms, but he didn’t.

1349
02:06:07,699 --> 02:06:11,760
“Can you be here about noon?”

1350
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:14,270
“Sure. What do you want to do?”

1351
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:19,119
“You’ll see,” he answered. “I know
just the place to go.”

1352
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:21,309
“Have I ever been there before?”

1353
02:06:21,309 --> 02:06:23,780
“No, but it’s a special place.”

1354
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:25,559
“Where is it?”

1355
02:06:25,559 --> 02:06:27,350
“It’s a surprise.”

1356
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:29,730
“Will I like it?”

1357
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:34,810
“You’ll love it,” he said.

1358
02:06:34,810 --> 02:06:39,910
She turned away before he could attempt a
kiss. She didn’t know if he would try but

1359
02:06:39,910 --> 02:06:45,349
knew for some reason that if he did, she would
have a hard time stopping him. She couldn’t

1360
02:06:45,349 --> 02:06:51,079
handle that right now, with everything going
through her head. She slid behind the wheel,

1361
02:06:51,079 --> 02:06:55,880
breathing a sigh of relief. He shut the door
for her, and she started the engine. As the

1362
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:58,980
car idled, she rolled down the window just
a bit.

1363
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:05,139
“See you tomorrow,” she said, her eyes
reflecting the moonlight.

1364
02:07:05,139 --> 02:07:09,929
Noah waved as she backed the car out. She
turned it around, then drove up the lane,

1365
02:07:09,929 --> 02:07:16,360
heading toward town. He watched the car until
the lights vanished behind far-off oak trees

1366
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:23,020
and the engine noise was gone. Clem wandered
up to him and he squatted down to pet her,

1367
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:28,940
paying special attention to her neck, scratching
the spot she couldn’t reach anymore. After

1368
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:35,830
he looked up the road one last time, they
returned to the back porch side by side.

1369
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:41,239
He sat in the rocker again, this time alone,
trying once again to fathom the evening that

1370
02:07:41,239 --> 02:07:48,679
had just passed. Thinking about it. Replaying
it. Seeing it again. Hearing it again. Running

1371
02:07:48,679 --> 02:07:54,829
it by in slow motion. He didn’t feel like
playing his guitar now, didn’t feel like

1372
02:07:54,829 --> 02:07:57,260
reading. Didn’t know what he felt.

1373
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:05,600
“She’s engaged,” he finally whispered,
and then was silent for hours, his rocker

1374
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:12,849
making the only noise. The night was quiet
now, with little activity except for Clem,

1375
02:08:12,849 --> 02:08:19,040
who visited him occasionally, checking on
him as if to ask “Are you all right?”

1376
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:26,440
And sometime after midnight on that clear
October evening, it all rushed inward and

1377
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:33,770
Noah was overcome with longing. And if anyone
had seen him, they would have seen what looked

1378
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:40,469
like an old man, someone who’d aged a lifetime
in just a couple of hours. Someone bent over

1379
02:08:40,469 --> 02:08:47,600
in his rocker with his face in his hands and
tears in his eyes.

1380
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:55,809
He didn’t know how to stop them.

1381
02:08:55,809 --> 02:09:00,159
Phone Calls

1382
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:02,280
Lon hung up the phone.

1383
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:08,219
He had called at seven, then at eight-thirty,
and now he checked his watch again. Nine forty-five.

1384
02:09:08,219 --> 02:09:10,760
Where was she?

1385
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:15,530
He knew she was where she had said she would
be because he had spoken to the manager earlier.

1386
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:22,030
Yes, she had checked in and he had last seen
her around six. Going to dinner, he thought.

1387
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:24,889
No, he hadn’t seen her since.

1388
02:09:24,889 --> 02:09:29,429
Lon shook his head and leaned back in his
chair. He was the last one in the office,

1389
02:09:29,429 --> 02:09:34,340
as usual, and everything was quiet. But that
was normal with an ongoing trial, even if

1390
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:41,059
the trial was going well. Law was his passion,
and the late hours alone gave him the opportunity

1391
02:09:41,059 --> 02:09:44,030
to catch up on his work without interruption.

1392
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:50,480
He knew he would win the case because he mastered
the law and charmed the jury. He always did,

1393
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:57,409
and losses were infrequent now. Part of it
came from being able to select the cases he

1394
02:09:57,409 --> 02:10:03,670
had the expertise to win. He had reached that
level in his practice. Only a select few in

1395
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:09,230
the city had that kind of stature, and his
earnings reflected that.

1396
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:14,960
But the more important part of his success
came from hard work. He had always paid attention

1397
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:20,380
to details, especially when he’d begun his
practice. Little things, obscure things, and

1398
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:26,079
it had become a habit now. Whether it was
a matter of law or presentation, he was diligent

1399
02:10:26,079 --> 02:10:31,460
in his study, and it had won him a few cases
early in his career when he should have lost.

1400
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:35,800
And now, a little detail bothered him.

1401
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:39,920
Not about the case. No, that was fine. It
was something else.

1402
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:42,120
Something about Allie.

1403
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:47,489
But damn, he couldn’t put his finger on
it. He was fine when she’d left this morning.

1404
02:10:47,489 --> 02:10:53,869
At least he thought he was. But sometime after
her call, maybe an hour or so, something clicked

1405
02:10:53,869 --> 02:10:57,909
in his mind. The little detail.

1406
02:10:57,909 --> 02:10:59,699
Detail.

1407
02:10:59,699 --> 02:11:09,780
Something insignificant? Something important?
Think . . . think . . . Damn, what was it?

1408
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:12,110
His mind clicked.

1409
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:18,940
Something . . . something . . . something
said? Something had been said? Yes, that was

1410
02:11:18,940 --> 02:11:24,520
it. He knew it. But what was it? Had Allie
said anything on the phone? That had been

1411
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:30,510
when it started, and he ran through the conversation
again. No, nothing out of the ordinary.

1412
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:32,860
But that was it, he was sure now.

1413
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:35,460
What had she said?

1414
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:42,649
Her trip was good, she had checked in, had
done some shopping. Left her number. That’s

1415
02:11:42,649 --> 02:11:45,829
about all.

1416
02:11:45,829 --> 02:11:51,309
He thought about her then. He loved her, he
was sure of that. Not only was she beautiful

1417
02:11:51,309 --> 02:11:57,011
and charming, but she’d become his source
of stability and best friend as well. After

1418
02:11:57,011 --> 02:12:01,680
a hard day at work, she was the first person
he would call. She would listen to him, laugh

1419
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:06,579
at the right moments, and had a sixth sense
about what he needed to hear.

1420
02:12:06,579 --> 02:12:14,190
But more than that, he admired the way she’d
always spoken her mind. He remembered that

1421
02:12:14,190 --> 02:12:19,290
after they’d gone out a few times, he’d
said to her what he said to all women he dated—that

1422
02:12:19,290 --> 02:12:24,369
he wasn’t ready for a steady relationship.
Unlike the others, though, Allie had simply

1423
02:12:24,369 --> 02:12:31,170
nodded and said, “Fine.” But on her way
out the door, she’d turned and said: “But

1424
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:37,320
your problem isn’t me, or your job, or your
freedom, or whatever else you think it is.

1425
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:44,909
Your problem is that you’re alone. Your
father made the Hammond name famous, and you’ve

1426
02:12:44,909 --> 02:12:50,530
probably been compared to him all your life.
You’ve never been your own person. A life

1427
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:55,239
like that makes you empty inside, and you’re
looking for someone who will magically fill

1428
02:12:55,239 --> 02:13:01,079
that void. But no one can do that but you.”

1429
02:13:01,079 --> 02:13:06,329
The words had stayed with him that night and
rung true the following morning. He’d called

1430
02:13:06,329 --> 02:13:13,599
again, asked for a second chance, and after
some persistence, she’d reluctantly agreed.

1431
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:19,349
In the four years they’d dated, she’d
become everything he ever wanted, and he knew

1432
02:13:19,349 --> 02:13:25,080
he should spend more time with her. But practicing
law made limiting his hours impossible. She’d

1433
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:31,699
always understood, but still, he cursed himself
for not making the time. Once he was married,

1434
02:13:31,699 --> 02:13:36,869
he’d shorten his hours, he promised himself.
He’d have his secretary check his schedule

1435
02:13:36,869 --> 02:13:40,470
to make sure he wasn’t overextending himself.
. . .

1436
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:41,940
Check? ...

1437
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:45,449
And his mind clicked another notch.

1438
02:13:45,449 --> 02:13:49,460
Check . . . checking . . . checking in?

1439
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:51,889
He looked to the ceiling. Checking in?

1440
02:13:51,889 --> 02:14:00,719
Yes, that was it. He closed his eyes and thought
for a second. No. Nothing. What, then?

1441
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:10,250
C’mon, don’t fail now. Think, damn it,
think. New Bern.

1442
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:14,900
The thought popped into his head just then.
Yes, New Bern. That was it. The little detail,

1443
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:17,660
or part of it. What else, though?

1444
02:14:17,660 --> 02:14:21,940
New Bern, he thought again, and knew the name.
Knew the town a little, mainly from a few

1445
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:27,909
trials he had been in. Stopped there a few
times on the way to the coast. Nothing special.

1446
02:14:27,909 --> 02:14:30,010
He and Allie had never been there together.

1447
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:34,080
But Allie had been there before. . . .

1448
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:38,369
And the rack tightened its grip, another part
coming together.

1449
02:14:38,369 --> 02:14:42,489
Another part. . . but there was more. . . .

1450
02:14:42,489 --> 02:14:50,020
Allie, New Bern . . . and . . . and . . . something
at a party. A comment in passing. From Allie’s

1451
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:54,460
mother. He’d hardly noticed it. But what
had she said?

1452
02:14:54,460 --> 02:15:03,309
And Lon paled then, remembering. Remembering
what had been said so long ago. Remembering

1453
02:15:03,309 --> 02:15:06,349
what Allie’s mother had said.

1454
02:15:06,349 --> 02:15:12,761
It was something about Allie being in love
one time with a young man from New Bern. Called

1455
02:15:12,761 --> 02:15:19,619
it puppy love. So what, he had thought when
he’d heard it, and had turned to smile at

1456
02:15:19,619 --> 02:15:20,619
Allie.

1457
02:15:20,619 --> 02:15:28,119
But she hadn’t smiled. She was angry. And
then Lon guessed that she had loved that person

1458
02:15:28,119 --> 02:15:36,809
far more deeply than her mother had suggested.
Maybe even more deeply than she loved him.

1459
02:15:36,809 --> 02:15:42,989
And now she was there. Interesting.

1460
02:15:42,989 --> 02:15:47,000
Lon brought his palms together, as though
he were praying, resting them against his

1461
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:55,139
lips. Coincidence? Could be nothing. Could
be exactly what she said. Could be stress

1462
02:15:55,139 --> 02:16:00,489
and antique shopping. Possible. Even probable.

1463
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:06,409
Yet . . . yet . . . what if?

1464
02:16:06,409 --> 02:16:12,219
Lon considered the other possibility, and
for the first time in a long time, he became

1465
02:16:12,219 --> 02:16:14,340
frightened.

1466
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:20,929
What if? What if she’s with him?

1467
02:16:20,929 --> 02:16:25,719
He cursed the trial, wishing it were over.
Wishing he had gone with her. Wondering if

1468
02:16:25,719 --> 02:16:30,449
she’d told him the truth, hoping that she
had.

1469
02:16:30,449 --> 02:16:37,580
And he made up his mind then not to lose her.
He would do anything it took to keep her.

1470
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:42,179
She was everything he’d always needed, and
he’d never find another quite like her.

1471
02:16:42,179 --> 02:16:50,600
So, with trembling hands, he dialed the phone
for the fourth and last time that evening.

1472
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:55,939
And again there was no answer.

1473
02:16:55,939 --> 02:17:02,960
Kayaks and Forgotten Dreams
Allie woke early the next morning, forced

1474
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:08,510
by the incessant chirping of starlings, and
rubbed her eyes, feeling the stiffness in

1475
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:14,429
her body. She hadn’t slept well, waking
after every dream, and she remembered seeing

1476
02:17:14,429 --> 02:17:19,800
the hands of the clock in different positions
during the night, as if verifying the passage

1477
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,149
of time.

1478
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:27,439
She’d slept in the soft shirt he’d given
her, and she smelled him once again while

1479
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:33,439
thinking about the evening they’d spent
together. The easy laughter and conversation

1480
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:39,099
came back to her, and she especially remembered
the way he’d talked about her painting.

1481
02:17:39,099 --> 02:17:45,580
It was so unexpected, yet uplifting, and as
the words began to replay in her mind, she

1482
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:51,940
realized how sorry she would have been had
she decided not to see him again.

1483
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:56,010
She looked out the window and watched the
chattering birds search for food in early

1484
02:17:56,010 --> 02:18:03,130
light. Noah, she knew, had always been a morning
person who greeted dawn in his own way. She

1485
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:08,070
knew he liked to kayak or canoe, and she remembered
the one morning she’d spent with him in

1486
02:18:08,070 --> 02:18:13,240
his canoe, watching the sun come up. She’d
had to sneak out her window to do it because

1487
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:17,809
her parents wouldn’t allow it, but she hadn’t
been caught and she remembered how Noah had

1488
02:18:17,809 --> 02:18:24,350
slipped his arm around her and pulled her
close as dawn began to unfold. “Look there,”

1489
02:18:24,350 --> 02:18:30,630
he’d whispered, and she’d watched her
first sunrise with her head on his shoulder,

1490
02:18:30,630 --> 02:18:35,410
wondering if anything could be better than
what was happening at that moment.

1491
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:40,760
And as she got out of bed to take her bath,
feeling the cold floor beneath her feet, she

1492
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:45,500
wondered if he’d been on the water this
morning watching another day begin, thinking

1493
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:49,689
somehow he probably had.

1494
02:18:49,689 --> 02:18:51,679
She was right.

1495
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:57,890
Noah was up before the sun and dressed quickly,
same jeans as last night, undershirt, clean

1496
02:18:57,890 --> 02:19:03,240
flannel shirt, blue jacket, and boots. He
brushed his teeth before going downstairs,

1497
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:08,219
drank a quick glass of milk, and grabbed two
biscuits on the way out the door. After Clem

1498
02:19:08,219 --> 02:19:12,809
greeted him with a couple of sloppy licks,
he walked to the dock where his kayak was

1499
02:19:12,809 --> 02:19:18,849
stored. He liked to let the river work its
magic, loosening up his muscles, warming his

1500
02:19:18,849 --> 02:19:21,120
body, clearing his mind.

1501
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:26,889
The old kayak, well used and river stained,
hung on two rusty hooks attached to his dock

1502
02:19:26,889 --> 02:19:32,760
just above the waterline to keep off the barnacles.
He lifted it free from the hooks and set it

1503
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:38,090
at his feet, inspected it quickly, then took
it to the bank. In a couple of seasoned moves

1504
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:43,230
long since mastered by habit, he had it in
the water working its way upstream with himself

1505
02:19:43,230 --> 02:19:46,139
as the pilot and engine.

1506
02:19:46,139 --> 02:19:52,520
The air was cool on his skin, almost crisp,
and the sky was a haze of different colors:

1507
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:59,060
black directly above him like a mountain peak,
then blues of infinite range, becoming lighter

1508
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:05,380
until it met the horizon, where gray took
its place. He took a few deep breaths, smelling

1509
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:12,410
pine trees and brackish water, and began to
reflect. This had been part of what he’d

1510
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:17,420
missed most when he had lived up north. Because
of the long hours at work, there had been

1511
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:23,159
little time to spend on the water. Camping,
hiking, paddling on rivers, dating, working

1512
02:20:23,159 --> 02:20:28,630
. . . something had had to go. For the most
part he’d been able to explore New Jersey’s

1513
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:34,030
countryside on foot whenever he’d had extra
time, but in fourteen years he hadn’t canoed

1514
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:39,690
or kayaked once. It had been one of the first
things he’d done when he returned.

1515
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:46,229
There’s something special, almost mystical,
about spending dawn on the water, he thought

1516
02:20:46,229 --> 02:20:54,150
to himself, and he did it almost every day
now. Sunny and clear or cold and bitter, it

1517
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:59,810
never mattered as he paddled in rhythm to
music in his head, working above water the

1518
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:06,210
color of iron. He saw a family of turtles
resting on a partially submerged log and watched

1519
02:21:06,210 --> 02:21:11,040
as a heron broke for flight, skimming just
above the water before vanishing into the

1520
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:15,859
silver twilight that preceded sunrise.

1521
02:21:15,859 --> 02:21:20,530
He paddled out to the middle of the creek,
where he watched the orange glow begin to

1522
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:25,700
stretch across the water. He stopped paddling
hard, giving just enough effort to keep him

1523
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:32,760
in place, staring until light began to break
through the trees. He always liked to pause

1524
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:38,569
at daybreak—there was a moment when the
view was spectacular, as if the world were

1525
02:21:38,569 --> 02:21:45,260
being born again. Afterward he began to paddle
hard, working off the tension, preparing for

1526
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:47,220
the day.

1527
02:21:47,220 --> 02:21:53,380
While he did that, questions danced in his
mind like water drops in a frying pan. He

1528
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:59,021
wondered about Lon and what type of man he
was, wondered about their relationship. Most

1529
02:21:59,021 --> 02:22:06,280
of all, though, he wondered about Allie and
why she had come.

1530
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:10,840
By the time he reached home, he felt renewed.
Checking his watch, he was surprised to find

1531
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:16,380
that it had taken two hours. Time always played
tricks out there, though, and he’d stopped

1532
02:22:16,380 --> 02:22:18,920
questioning it months ago.

1533
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:23,800
He hung the kayak to dry, stretched for a
couple of minutes, and went to the shed where

1534
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:29,060
he stored his canoe. He carried it to the
bank, leaving it a few feet from the water,

1535
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:34,570
and as he turned toward the house, he noted
that his legs were still a little stiff.

1536
02:22:34,570 --> 02:22:38,560
The morning haze hadn’t burned off yet,
and he knew the stiffness in his legs usually

1537
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:45,881
predicted rain. He looked to the western sky
and saw storm clouds, thick and heavy, far

1538
02:22:45,881 --> 02:22:51,800
off but definitely present. The winds weren’t
blowing hard, but they were bringing the clouds

1539
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:58,710
closer. From the looks of them, he didn’t
want to be outside when they got here. Damn.

1540
02:22:58,710 --> 02:23:03,770
How much time did he have? A few hours, maybe
more. Maybe less.

1541
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:09,180
He showered, put on new jeans, a red shirt,
and black cowboy boots, brushed his hair,

1542
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:13,840
and went downstairs to the kitchen. He did
the dishes from the night before, picked up

1543
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:19,140
a little around the house, made himself some
coffee, and went to the porch. The sky was

1544
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:24,970
darker now, and he checked the barometer.
Steady, but it would start dropping soon.

1545
02:23:24,970 --> 02:23:27,200
The western sky promised that.

1546
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:32,970
He’d learned long ago to never underestimate
the weather, and he wondered if it was a good

1547
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:39,260
idea to go out. The rain he could deal with;
lightning was a different story. Especially

1548
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:46,360
if he was on the water. A canoe was no place
to be when electricity sparked in humid air.

1549
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:51,510
He finished his coffee, putting off the decision
until later. He went to the toolshed and found

1550
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:56,771
his ax. After checking the blade by pressing
his thumb to it, he sharpened it with a whetstone

1551
02:23:56,771 --> 02:24:04,130
until it was ready. “A dull ax is more dangerous
than a sharp one,” his daddy used to say.

1552
02:24:04,130 --> 02:24:09,359
He spent the next twenty minutes splitting
and stacking logs. He did it easily, his strokes

1553
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:14,931
efficient, and didn’t break a sweat. He
set a few logs off to the side for later and

1554
02:24:14,931 --> 02:24:18,910
brought them inside when he was finished,
putting them by the fireplace.

1555
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:24,040
He looked at Allie’s painting again and
reached out to touch it, bringing back the

1556
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:31,029
feelings of disbelief at seeing her again.
God, what was it about her that made him feel

1557
02:24:31,029 --> 02:24:39,370
this way? Even after all these years? What
sort of power did she have over him?

1558
02:24:39,370 --> 02:24:44,479
He finally turned away, shaking his head,
and went back to the porch. He checked the

1559
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:50,540
barometer again. It hadn’t changed. Then
he looked at his watch.

1560
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:53,680
Allie should be here soon.

1561
02:24:53,680 --> 02:25:01,450
Allie had finished her bath and was already
dressed. Earlier she’d opened the window

1562
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:07,000
to check the temperature. It wasn’t cold
outside, and she’d decided on a cream-colored

1563
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,890
spring dress with long sleeves and a high
neck. It was soft and comfortable, maybe a

1564
02:25:12,890 --> 02:25:18,630
little snug, but it looked good, and she had
selected some white sandals that matched.

1565
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:23,761
She spent the morning walking around downtown.
The Depression had taken its toll here, but

1566
02:25:23,761 --> 02:25:29,729
she could see the signs of prosperity beginning
to work their way back. The Masonic theater,

1567
02:25:29,729 --> 02:25:34,170
the oldest active theater in the country,
looked a little more run-down but was still

1568
02:25:34,170 --> 02:25:39,819
operating with a couple of recent movies.
Fort Totten Park looked exactly the same as

1569
02:25:39,819 --> 02:25:44,430
it had fourteen years ago, and she assumed
the kids who played on the swings after school

1570
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:50,680
looked the same as well. She smiled at the
memory then, thinking back to when things

1571
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:55,149
were simpler. Or at least had seemed to be.

1572
02:25:55,149 --> 02:26:03,500
Now, it seemed, nothing was simple. It seemed
so improbable, everything falling into place

1573
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:08,040
as it had, and she wondered what she would
have been doing now, had she never seen the

1574
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:15,340
article in the paper. It wasn’t very difficult
to imagine, because her routines seldom changed.

1575
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:20,720
It was Wednesday, which meant bridge at the
country club, then on to the Junior Women’s

1576
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:25,021
League, where they would probably be arranging
another fund-raiser for the private school

1577
02:26:25,021 --> 02:26:29,950
or hospital. After that, a visit with her
mother, then home to get ready for dinner

1578
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:34,930
with Lon, because he made it a point to leave
work by seven. It was the one night a week

1579
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:38,689
she saw him regularly.

1580
02:26:38,689 --> 02:26:44,510
She suppressed a feeling of sadness about
that, hoping that one day he would change.

1581
02:26:44,510 --> 02:26:49,220
He had often promised to and usually followed
through for a few weeks before drifting back

1582
02:26:49,220 --> 02:26:54,310
to the same schedule. “I can’t tonight,
honey,” he would always explain. “I’m

1583
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:59,399
sorry, but I can’t. Let me make it up to
you later.”

1584
02:26:59,399 --> 02:27:03,080
She didn’t like to argue with him about
it, mostly because she knew he was telling

1585
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:09,060
the truth. Trial work was demanding, both
beforehand and during, yet she couldn’t

1586
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:14,771
help wondering sometimes why he had spent
so much time courting her if he didn’t want

1587
02:27:14,771 --> 02:27:18,510
to spend the time with her now.

1588
02:27:18,510 --> 02:27:23,250
She passed an art gallery, almost walked by
it in her preoccupation, then turned and went

1589
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:29,330
back. She paused at the door for a second,
surprised at how long it had been since she’d

1590
02:27:29,330 --> 02:27:38,510
been in one. At least three years, maybe longer.
Why had she avoided it?

1591
02:27:38,510 --> 02:27:42,810
She went inside—it had opened with the rest
of the shops on Front Street—and browsed

1592
02:27:42,810 --> 02:27:47,720
among the paintings. Many of the artists were
local, and there was a strong sea flavor to

1593
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:55,229
their works. Lots of ocean scenes, sandy beaches,
pelicans, old sailing ships, tug-boats, piers,

1594
02:27:55,229 --> 02:28:02,810
and seagulls. But most of all, waves. Waves
of every shape, size, and color imaginable,

1595
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:09,620
and after a while they all looked alike. The
artists were either uninspired or lazy, she

1596
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:12,390
thought.

1597
02:28:12,390 --> 02:28:18,101
On one wall though, there were a few paintings
that more suited her tastes. All were by an

1598
02:28:18,101 --> 02:28:23,240
artist she’d never heard of, Elayn, and
most appeared to have been inspired by the

1599
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:28,859
architecture of the Greek islands. In the
painting she liked the best, she noted the

1600
02:28:28,859 --> 02:28:34,610
artist had purposely exaggerated the scene
with smaller-than-life figures, wide lines,

1601
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:41,470
and heavy sweeps of color, as if not completely
focused. Yet the colors were vivid and swirling,

1602
02:28:41,470 --> 02:28:48,479
drawing the eye in, almost directing what
it should see next. It was dynamic, dramatic.

1603
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:52,470
The more she thought about it, the more she
liked it, and she considered buying it before

1604
02:28:52,470 --> 02:28:58,920
she realized that she liked it because it
reminded her of her own work. She examined

1605
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:05,510
it more closely and thought to herself that
maybe Noah was right. Maybe she should start

1606
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:09,930
painting again.

1607
02:29:09,930 --> 02:29:15,700
At nine-thirty Allie left the gallery and
went to Hoffman-Lane, a department store downtown.

1608
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:19,140
It took a few minutes to find what she was
looking for, but it was there, in the school

1609
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:24,970
supply section. Paper, drawing chalk, and
pencils, not high quality but good enough.

1610
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:28,840
It wasn’t painting, but it was a start,
and she was excited by the time she got back

1611
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:34,260
to her room. She sat at the desk and started
working: nothing specific, just getting the

1612
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:40,050
feel of it again, letting shapes and colors
flow from the memory of her youth. After a

1613
02:29:40,050 --> 02:29:44,580
few minutes of abstraction, she did a rough
sketch of the street scene as seen from her

1614
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:51,420
room, amazed at how easily it came. It was
almost as if she’d never stopped.

1615
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:56,080
She examined it when she was finished, pleased
with the effort. She wondered what to try

1616
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:02,450
next and finally decided. Since she didn’t
have a model, she visualized it in her head

1617
02:30:02,450 --> 02:30:07,880
before starting. And though it was harder
than the street scene, it came naturally and

1618
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:10,790
began to take form.

1619
02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:15,319
Minutes passed quickly. She worked steadily
but checked the time frequently so she wouldn’t

1620
02:30:15,319 --> 02:30:20,620
be late, and she finished it a little before
noon. It had taken almost two hours, but the

1621
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:26,990
end result surprised her. It looked as though
it had taken a great deal longer. After rolling

1622
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:31,370
it up, she put it in a bag and collected the
rest of her things. On her way out the door,

1623
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:37,390
she looked at herself in the mirror, feeling
oddly relaxed, not exactly sure why.

1624
02:30:37,390 --> 02:30:41,470
Down the stairs again and out the door. As
she left she heard a voice behind her.

1625
02:30:41,470 --> 02:30:42,470
“Miss?”

1626
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:46,990
She turned, knowing it was directed at her.
The manager. Same man as yesterday, a curious

1627
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:48,520
look on his face.

1628
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:49,520
“Yes?”

1629
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:52,270
“You had some calls last night.”

1630
02:30:52,270 --> 02:30:54,220
She was shocked. “I did?”

1631
02:30:54,220 --> 02:30:56,450
“Yes. All from a Mr. Hammond.”

1632
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:57,790
Oh, God.

1633
02:30:57,790 --> 02:30:59,130
“Lon called?”

1634
02:30:59,130 --> 02:31:03,660
“Yes, ma’am, four times. I talked to him
when he called the second time. He was rather

1635
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:08,130
concerned about you. He said he was your fiancé.”

1636
02:31:08,130 --> 02:31:15,960
She smiled weakly, trying to hide what she
was thinking. Four times? Four? What could

1637
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:20,510
that mean? What if something had happened
back home?

1638
02:31:20,510 --> 02:31:24,140
“Did he say anything? Is it an emergency?”

1639
02:31:24,140 --> 02:31:27,950
He shook his head quickly. “He really didn’t
say, miss, but he didn’t mention anything.

1640
02:31:27,950 --> 02:31:31,360
Actually, he sounded more concerned about
you, though.”

1641
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:37,189
Good, she thought. That’s good. And then,
just as suddenly, a pang in her chest. Why

1642
02:31:37,189 --> 02:31:45,250
the urgency? Why so many calls? Had she said
anything yesterday? Why would he be so persistent?

1643
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:46,970
It was completely unlike him.

1644
02:31:46,970 --> 02:31:53,600
Is there any way he could have found out?
No . . . that was impossible. Unless someone

1645
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:58,819
saw her here yesterday and called. . . . But
they would have had to follow her out to Noah’s.

1646
02:31:58,819 --> 02:32:01,770
No one would have done that.

1647
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:07,300
She had to call him now; no way to get around
it. But she didn’t want to, strangely. This

1648
02:32:07,300 --> 02:32:13,790
was her time, and she wanted to spend it doing
what she wanted. She hadn’t planned on speaking

1649
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:17,689
to him until later, and for some reason she
felt almost as if talking to him now would

1650
02:32:17,689 --> 02:32:25,260
spoil the day. Besides, what was she going
to say? How could she explain being out so

1651
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:29,391
late? A late dinner and then a walk? Maybe.
Or a movie? Or . . .

1652
02:32:29,391 --> 02:32:32,660
“Miss?”

1653
02:32:32,660 --> 02:32:37,470
Almost noon, she thought. Where would he be?
His office, probably.... No. In court, she

1654
02:32:37,470 --> 02:32:41,729
suddenly realized, and immediately felt as
if she’d been released from shackles. There

1655
02:32:41,729 --> 02:32:48,410
was no way she could talk to him, even if
she wanted to. She was surprised by her feelings.

1656
02:32:48,410 --> 02:32:52,990
She shouldn’t feel this way, she knew, and
yet it didn’t bother her. She looked at

1657
02:32:52,990 --> 02:32:55,860
her watch, acting now.

1658
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:59,040
“Is it really almost twelve?”

1659
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:03,740
The manager nodded after looking at the clock.
“Yes, a quarter till, actually.”

1660
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:07,850
“Unfortunately,” she started, “he’s
in court right now and I can’t reach him.

1661
02:33:07,850 --> 02:33:11,250
If he does call again, could you tell him
I’m shopping and that I’ll try to call

1662
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:12,319
him later?”

1663
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:18,870
“Of course,” he answered. She could see
the question in his eyes, though: But where

1664
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:26,130
were you last night? He had known exactly
when she’d come in. Too late for a single

1665
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:28,930
woman in this small town, she was sure.

1666
02:33:28,930 --> 02:33:34,729
“Thank you,” she said, smiling. “I’d
appreciate it.”

1667
02:33:34,729 --> 02:33:40,609
Two minutes later she was in her car, driving
to Noah’s, anticipating the day, largely

1668
02:33:40,609 --> 02:33:47,050
unconcerned about the phone calls. Yesterday
she would have been, and she wondered what

1669
02:33:47,050 --> 02:33:50,290
that meant.

1670
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:55,930
As she was driving over the drawbridge less
than four minutes after she’d left the inn,

1671
02:33:55,930 --> 02:34:04,800
Lon called from the courthouse.

1672
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:08,939
Moving Water

1673
02:34:08,939 --> 02:34:13,790
Noah was sitting in his rocker, drinking sweet
tea, listening for the car, when he finally

1674
02:34:13,790 --> 02:34:19,260
heard it turn up the drive. He went around
front and watched the car pull up and park

1675
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:25,550
beneath the oak tree again. Same spot as yesterday.
Clem barked a greeting at her car door, tail

1676
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:29,530
wagging, and he saw Allie wave from inside
the car.

1677
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:35,350
She stepped out, patted Clem on the head while
she cooed at her, then turned, smiling at

1678
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:42,780
Noah as he walked toward her. She looked more
relaxed than yesterday, more confident, and

1679
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:47,562
again he felt a slight shock at seeing her.
It was different from yesterday, though. Newer

1680
02:34:47,562 --> 02:34:53,420
feelings now, not simply memories anymore.
If anything, his attraction for her had grown

1681
02:34:53,420 --> 02:35:00,270
stronger overnight, more intense, and it made
him feel a little nervous in her presence.

1682
02:35:00,270 --> 02:35:05,109
Allie met him halfway, carrying a small bag
in one hand. She surprised him by kissing

1683
02:35:05,109 --> 02:35:10,430
him gently on the cheek, her free hand lingering
at his waist after she pulled back.

1684
02:35:10,430 --> 02:35:15,850
“Hi,” she said, radiance in her eyes,
“where’s the surprise?”

1685
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:21,370
He relaxed a little, thanking God for that.
“Not even a ‘Good afternoon’ or ‘How

1686
02:35:21,370 --> 02:35:23,319
was your night?’”

1687
02:35:23,319 --> 02:35:28,100
She smiled. Patience had never been one of
her strongest attributes.

1688
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:33,080
“Fine. Good afternoon. How was your night?
And where’s the surprise?”

1689
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:37,710
He chuckled lightly, then paused. “Allie,
I’ve got some bad news.”

1690
02:35:37,710 --> 02:35:38,710
“What?”

1691
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:43,160
“I was going to take you someplace, but
with those clouds coming in, I’m not sure

1692
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:44,260
we should go.”

1693
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:45,260
“Why?”

1694
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:50,779
“The storm. We’ll be outside and might
get wet. Besides, there might be lightning.”

1695
02:35:50,779 --> 02:35:53,390
“It’s not raining yet. How far is it?”

1696
02:35:53,390 --> 02:35:54,840
“Up the creek about a mile.”

1697
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:57,450
“And I’ve never been there before?”

1698
02:35:57,450 --> 02:36:00,649
“Not when it was like this.”

1699
02:36:00,649 --> 02:36:04,940
She thought for a second while she looked
around. When she spoke, her voice was determined.

1700
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:09,540
“Then we’ll go. I don’t care if it rains.”

1701
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:12,230
“Are you sure?”

1702
02:36:12,230 --> 02:36:13,230
“Absolutely.”

1703
02:36:13,230 --> 02:36:18,180
He looked at the clouds again, noting their
approach. “Then we’d better go now,”

1704
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:21,670
he said. “Can I bring that in for you?”

1705
02:36:21,670 --> 02:36:26,399
She nodded, handing her bag to him, and he
jogged to the house and brought it inside,

1706
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:30,680
where he placed it on a chair in the living
room. Then he grabbed some bread and put it

1707
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:34,420
in a bag, bringing it with him as he left
the house.

1708
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:39,870
They walked to the canoe, Allie beside him.
A little closer than yesterday.

1709
02:36:39,870 --> 02:36:41,630
“What exactly is this place?”

1710
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:42,760
“You’ll see.”

1711
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:45,899
“You’re not even going to give me a hint?”

1712
02:36:45,899 --> 02:36:49,939
“Well,” he said, “do you remember when
we took the canoe out and watched the sun

1713
02:36:49,939 --> 02:36:50,939
come up?”

1714
02:36:50,939 --> 02:36:54,580
“I thought about it this morning. I remember
it made me cry.”

1715
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:59,830
“What you’re going to see today makes
what you saw then seem ordinary.”

1716
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:04,319
“I guess I should feel special.”

1717
02:37:04,319 --> 02:37:06,740
He took a few steps before responding.

1718
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:14,920
“You are special,” he finally said, and
the way he said it made her wonder if he wanted

1719
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:23,430
to add something else. But he didn’t, and
Allie smiled a little before glancing away.

1720
02:37:23,430 --> 02:37:28,470
As she did, she felt the wind in her face
and noticed it had picked up since the morning.

1721
02:37:28,470 --> 02:37:33,560
They reached the dock a moment later. After
tossing the bag in the canoe, Noah quickly

1722
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:37,580
checked to make sure he hadn’t missed anything,
then slid the canoe to the water.

1723
02:37:37,580 --> 02:37:39,370
“Can I do anything?”

1724
02:37:39,370 --> 02:37:42,920
“No, just get in.”

1725
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:47,979
After she climbed in, he pushed the canoe
farther into the water, close to the dock.

1726
02:37:47,979 --> 02:37:52,300
Then he gracefully stepped off the dock into
the canoe, placing his feet carefully to prevent

1727
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:58,189
the canoe from capsizing. Allie was impressed
by his agility, knowing that what he had done

1728
02:37:58,189 --> 02:38:02,670
so quickly and easily was harder than it looked.

1729
02:38:02,670 --> 02:38:07,570
Allie sat at the front of the canoe, facing
backward. He had said something about missing

1730
02:38:07,570 --> 02:38:12,700
the view when he started to paddle, but she’d
shaken her head, saying she was fine the way

1731
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:14,840
she was.

1732
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:16,700
And it was true.

1733
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:20,850
She could see everything she really wanted
to see if she turned her head, but most of

1734
02:38:20,850 --> 02:38:27,760
all she wanted to watch Noah. It was him she’d
come to see, not the creek. His shirt was

1735
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:33,700
unbuttoned at the top, and she could see his
chest muscles flex with every stroke. His

1736
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:39,030
sleeves were rolled up, too, and she could
see the muscles in his arms bulging slightly.

1737
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:43,229
His muscles were well developed there from
paddling every morning.

1738
02:38:43,229 --> 02:38:51,700
Artistic, she thought. There’s something
almost artistic about him when he does this.

1739
02:38:51,700 --> 02:38:57,720
Something natural, as if being on the water
were beyond his control, part of a gene passed

1740
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:05,680
on to him from some obscure hereditary pool.
When she watched him, she was reminded of

1741
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:10,910
how the early explorers must have looked when
they’d first discovered this area.

1742
02:39:10,910 --> 02:39:15,910
She couldn’t think of anyone else who remotely
resembled him. He was complicated, almost

1743
02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:24,260
contradictory in so many ways, yet simple,
a strangely erotic combination. On the surface

1744
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:30,170
he was a country boy, home from war, and he
probably saw himself in those terms. Yet there

1745
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:36,170
was so much more to him. Perhaps it was the
poetry that made him different, or perhaps

1746
02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:41,880
it was the values his father had instilled
in him, growing up. Either way, he seemed

1747
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:46,770
to savor life more fully than others appeared
to, and that was what had first attracted

1748
02:39:46,770 --> 02:39:48,040
her to him.

1749
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:52,130
“What are you thinking?”

1750
02:39:52,130 --> 02:39:58,090
She felt her insides jump just a bit as Noah’s
voice brought her back to the present. She

1751
02:39:58,090 --> 02:40:02,390
realized she hadn’t said much since they’d
started, and she appreciated the silence he

1752
02:40:02,390 --> 02:40:07,100
had allowed her. He’d always been considerate
like that.

1753
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:15,080
“Good things,” she answered quietly, and
she saw in his eyes that he knew she was thinking

1754
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:21,620
about him. She liked the fact that he knew
it, and she hoped he had been thinking about

1755
02:40:21,620 --> 02:40:24,760
her as well.

1756
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:31,820
She understood then that something was stirring
within her, as it had so many years ago. Watching

1757
02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:39,670
him, watching his body move, made her feel
it. And as their eyes lingered for a second,

1758
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:47,420
she felt the heat in her neck and breasts,
and she flushed, turning away before he noticed.

1759
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:50,620
“How much farther?” she asked.

1760
02:40:50,620 --> 02:40:55,470
“Another half mile or so. Not any more than
that.”

1761
02:40:55,470 --> 02:41:06,359
A pause. Then, she said: “It’s pretty
out here. So clean. So quiet. It’s almost

1762
02:41:06,359 --> 02:41:09,521
like going back in time.”

1763
02:41:09,521 --> 02:41:17,410
“In a way it is, I think. The creek flows
from the forest. There’s not a single farm

1764
02:41:17,410 --> 02:41:23,439
between here and where it starts, and the
water is pure as rain. It’s probably as

1765
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:27,000
pure as it’s ever been.”

1766
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:33,840
She leaned toward him. “Tell me, Noah, what
do you remember most from the summer we spent

1767
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:34,950
together?”

1768
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:36,920
“All of it.”

1769
02:41:36,920 --> 02:41:39,180
“Anything in particular?”

1770
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:41,439
“No,” he said.

1771
02:41:41,439 --> 02:41:43,700
“You don’t remember?”

1772
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:50,899
He answered after a moment, quietly, seriously.
“No, it’s not that. It’s not what you’re

1773
02:41:50,899 --> 02:41:56,340
thinking. I was serious when I said ‘all
of it.’ I can remember every moment we were

1774
02:41:56,340 --> 02:42:03,260
together, and in each of them there was something
wonderful. I can’t really pick any one time

1775
02:42:03,260 --> 02:42:08,931
that meant more than any other. The entire
summer was perfect, the kind of summer everyone

1776
02:42:08,931 --> 02:42:13,930
should have. How could I pick one moment over
another?

1777
02:42:13,930 --> 02:42:20,080
“Poets often describe love as an emotion
that we can’t control, one that overwhelms

1778
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:26,390
logic and common sense. That’s what it was
like for me. I didn’t plan on falling in

1779
02:42:26,390 --> 02:42:31,850
love with you, and I doubt if you planned
on falling in love with me. But once we met,

1780
02:42:31,850 --> 02:42:39,760
it was clear that neither of us could control
what was happening to us. We fell in love,

1781
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:46,450
despite our differences, and once we did,
something rare and beautiful was created.

1782
02:42:46,450 --> 02:42:54,550
For me, love like that has happened only once,
and that’s why every minute we spent together

1783
02:42:54,550 --> 02:43:01,149
has been seared in my memory. I’ll never
forget a single moment of it.”

1784
02:43:01,149 --> 02:43:08,090
Allie stared at him. No one had ever said
anything like that to her before. Ever. She

1785
02:43:08,090 --> 02:43:12,760
didn’t know what to say and stayed silent,
her face hot.

1786
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:19,689
“I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable,
Allie. I didn’t mean to. But that summer

1787
02:43:19,689 --> 02:43:25,870
has stayed with me and probably always will.
I know it can’t be the same between us,

1788
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:30,660
but that doesn’t change the way I felt about
you then.”

1789
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:33,420
She spoke quietly, feeling warm.

1790
02:43:33,420 --> 02:43:40,430
“It didn’t make me uncomfortable, Noah.
...It’s just that I don’t ever hear things

1791
02:43:40,430 --> 02:43:47,640
like that. What you said was beautiful. It
takes a poet to talk the way you do, and like

1792
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:53,600
I said, you’re the only poet I’ve ever
met.”

1793
02:43:53,600 --> 02:44:00,270
Peaceful silence descended on them. An osprey
cried somewhere in the distance. A mullet

1794
02:44:00,270 --> 02:44:06,090
splashed near the bank. The paddle moved rhythmically,
causing baffles that rocked the boat ever

1795
02:44:06,090 --> 02:44:13,200
so slightly. The breeze had stopped, and the
clouds grew blacker as the canoe moved toward

1796
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:17,790
some unknown destination.

1797
02:44:17,790 --> 02:44:27,020
Allie noticed it all, every sound, every thought.
Her senses had come alive, invigorating her,

1798
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:33,310
and she felt her mind drifting through the
last few weeks. She thought about the anxiety

1799
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:39,020
coming here had caused her. The shock at seeing
the article, the sleepless nights, her short

1800
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:45,399
temper during daylight. Even yesterday she
had been afraid and wanted to run away. The

1801
02:44:45,399 --> 02:44:51,720
tension was gone now, every bit of it, replaced
by something else, and she was glad about

1802
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:58,370
that as she rode in silence in the old red
canoe.

1803
02:44:58,370 --> 02:45:03,600
She felt strangely satisfied that she’d
come, pleased that Noah had turned into the

1804
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:10,410
type of man she’d thought he would, pleased
that she would live forever with that knowledge.

1805
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:16,870
She had seen too many men in the past few
years destroyed by war, or time, or even money.

1806
02:45:16,870 --> 02:45:23,500
It took strength to hold on to inner passion,
and Noah had done that.

1807
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:28,859
This was a worker’s world, not a poet’s,
and people would have a hard time understanding

1808
02:45:28,859 --> 02:45:35,939
Noah. America was in full swing now, all the
papers said so, and people were rushing forward,

1809
02:45:35,939 --> 02:45:42,260
leaving behind the horrors of war. She understood
the reasons, but they were rushing, like Lon,

1810
02:45:42,260 --> 02:45:49,220
toward long hours and profits, neglecting
the things that brought beauty to the world.

1811
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:55,420
Who did she know in Raleigh who took time
off to fix a house? Or read Whitman or Eliot,

1812
02:45:55,420 --> 02:46:03,210
finding images in the mind, thoughts of the
spirit? Or hunted dawn from the bow of a canoe?

1813
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:07,960
These weren’t the things that drove society,
but she felt they shouldn’t be treated as

1814
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:12,660
unimportant. They made living worthwhile.

1815
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:18,890
To her it was the same with art, though she
had realized it only upon coming here. Or

1816
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:24,730
rather, remembered it. She had known it once
before, and again she cursed herself for forgetting

1817
02:46:24,730 --> 02:46:30,680
something as important as creating beauty.
Painting was what she was meant to do, she

1818
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:37,500
was sure of that now. Her feelings this morning
had confirmed it, and she knew that whatever

1819
02:46:37,500 --> 02:46:43,790
happened, she was going to give it another
shot. A fair shot, no matter what anyone said.

1820
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:48,490
Would Lon encourage her painting? She remembered
showing him one of her paintings a couple

1821
02:46:48,490 --> 02:46:52,859
of months after they had first started going
out. It was an abstract painting and was meant

1822
02:46:52,859 --> 02:46:58,229
to inspire thought. In a way, it resembled
the painting above Noah’s fireplace, the

1823
02:46:58,229 --> 02:47:03,520
one Noah understood completely, though it
may have been a touch less passionate. Lon

1824
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:11,050
had stared at it, studied it almost, and then
had asked her what it was supposed to be.

1825
02:47:11,050 --> 02:47:14,820
She hadn’t bothered to answer.

1826
02:47:14,820 --> 02:47:20,300
She shook her head then, knowing she wasn’t
being completely fair. She loved Lon, and

1827
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:26,010
always had, for other reasons. Though he wasn’t
Noah, Lon was a good man, the kind of man

1828
02:47:26,010 --> 02:47:31,340
she’d always known she would marry. With
Lon there would be no surprises, and there

1829
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:36,460
was comfort in knowing what the future would
bring. He would be a kind husband to her,

1830
02:47:36,460 --> 02:47:41,870
and she would be a good wife. She would have
a home near friends and family, children,

1831
02:47:41,870 --> 02:47:47,010
a respectable place in society. It was the
kind of life she’d always expected to live,

1832
02:47:47,010 --> 02:47:53,310
the kind of life she wanted to live. And though
she wouldn’t describe theirs as a passionate

1833
02:47:53,310 --> 02:47:58,590
relationship, she had convinced herself long
ago that this wasn’t necessary to be fulfilled

1834
02:47:58,590 --> 02:48:04,840
in a relationship, even with a person she
intended to marry. Passion would fade in time,

1835
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:12,729
and things like companionship and compatibility
would take its place. She and Lon had this,

1836
02:48:12,729 --> 02:48:17,460
and she had assumed this was all she needed.

1837
02:48:17,460 --> 02:48:25,010
But now, as she watched Noah rowing, she questioned
this basic assumption. He exuded sexuality

1838
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:30,650
in everything he did, everything he was, and
she caught herself thinking about him in a

1839
02:48:30,650 --> 02:48:37,410
way that an engaged woman shouldn’t. She
tried not to stare and glanced away often,

1840
02:48:37,410 --> 02:48:42,439
but the easy way he moved his body made it
hard to keep her eyes from him for long.

1841
02:48:42,439 --> 02:48:49,810
“Here we are,” Noah said as he guided
the canoe toward some trees near the bank.

1842
02:48:49,810 --> 02:48:54,960
Allie looked around, not seeing anything.
“Where is it?”

1843
02:48:54,960 --> 02:49:00,080
“Here,” he said again, pointing the canoe
at an old tree that had fallen over, obscuring

1844
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:04,140
an opening almost completely hidden from view.

1845
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:08,859
He guided the canoe around the tree, and both
of them had to lower their heads to keep from

1846
02:49:08,859 --> 02:49:10,420
bumping them.

1847
02:49:10,420 --> 02:49:18,520
“Close your eyes,” he whispered, and Allie
did, bringing her hands to her face. She heard

1848
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:24,100
the baffles of the water and felt the movement
of the canoe as he propelled it forward, away

1849
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:26,529
from the pull of the creek.

1850
02:49:26,529 --> 02:49:39,370
“Okay,” he finally said after he’d stopped
paddling. “You can open them now.”

1851
02:49:39,370 --> 02:49:45,950
Swans and Storms
They sat in the middle of a small lake fed

1852
02:49:45,950 --> 02:49:51,760
by the waters of Brices Creek. It wasn’t
large, maybe a hundred yards across, and she

1853
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:56,960
was surprised at how invisible it had been
just moments before.

1854
02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:04,080
It was spectacular. Tundra swan and Canada
geese literally surrounded them. Thousands

1855
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:09,130
of them. Birds floating so close together
in some places that she couldn’t see the

1856
02:50:09,130 --> 02:50:14,080
water. From a distance, the groups of swans
looked almost like icebergs.

1857
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:21,890
“Oh, Noah,” she finally said softly, “it’s
beautiful.”

1858
02:50:21,890 --> 02:50:28,239
They sat in silence for a long while, watching
the birds. Noah pointed out a group of chicks,

1859
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:34,050
recently hatched, following a pack of geese
near the shore, struggling to keep up.

1860
02:50:34,050 --> 02:50:39,970
The air was filled with honking and chirping
as Noah moved the canoe through the water.

1861
02:50:39,970 --> 02:50:44,239
The birds ignored them for the most part.
The only ones who seemed bothered were those

1862
02:50:44,239 --> 02:50:50,420
forced to move when the canoe approached them.
Allie reached out to touch the closest ones

1863
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:54,680
and felt their feathers ruffling under her
fingers.

1864
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:59,609
Noah brought out the bag of bread he’d brought
earlier and handed it to Allie. She scattered

1865
02:50:59,609 --> 02:51:05,210
the bread, favoring the little ones, laughing
and smiling as they swam in circles, looking

1866
02:51:05,210 --> 02:51:09,520
for food.

1867
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:15,649
They stayed until thunder boomed in the distance—faint
but powerful—and both of them knew it was

1868
02:51:15,649 --> 02:51:17,729
time to leave.

1869
02:51:17,729 --> 02:51:22,340
Noah led them back to the current of the creek,
paddling stronger than he had earlier. She

1870
02:51:22,340 --> 02:51:25,530
was still amazed by what she had seen.

1871
02:51:25,530 --> 02:51:27,540
“Noah, what are they doing here?”

1872
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:33,550
“I don’t know. I know the swans from up
north migrate to Lake Matamuskeet every winter,

1873
02:51:33,550 --> 02:51:38,069
but I guess they came here this time. I don’t
know why. Maybe the early blizzard had something

1874
02:51:38,069 --> 02:51:41,870
to do with it. Maybe they got off track or
something. They’ll find their way back,

1875
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:42,870
though.”

1876
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:43,870
“They won’t stay?”

1877
02:51:43,870 --> 02:51:48,960
“I doubt it. They’re driven by instinct,
and this isn’t their place. Some of the

1878
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:54,470
geese may winter here, but the swans will
go back to Matamuskeet.”

1879
02:51:54,470 --> 02:52:01,101
Noah paddled hard as dark clouds rolled directly
overhead. Soon rain began to fall, a light

1880
02:52:01,101 --> 02:52:08,640
sprinkle at first, then gradually harder.
Lightning ...a pause . . . then thunder again.

1881
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:14,979
A little louder now. Maybe six or seven miles
away. More rain as Noah began to paddle even

1882
02:52:14,979 --> 02:52:18,561
harder, his muscles tightening with every
stroke.

1883
02:52:18,561 --> 02:52:20,851
Thicker drops now.

1884
02:52:20,851 --> 02:52:21,851
Falling . . .

1885
02:52:21,851 --> 02:52:22,851
Falling with the wind . . .

1886
02:52:22,851 --> 02:52:28,630
Falling hard and thick . . . Noah rowing . . . racing
the sky . . . still getting wet . . . cursing

1887
02:52:28,630 --> 02:52:32,529
to himself . . . losing to Mother Nature...

1888
02:52:32,529 --> 02:52:37,859
The downpour was steady now, and Allie watched
the rain fall diagonally from the sky, trying

1889
02:52:37,859 --> 02:52:43,930
to defy gravity as it rode on westerly winds
that whistled over the trees. The sky darkened

1890
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:50,990
a little more, and big heavy drops fell from
the clouds. Hurricane drops.

1891
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:56,420
Allie enjoyed the rain and leaned her head
back for a moment to let it hit her face.

1892
02:52:56,420 --> 02:53:00,399
She knew the front of her dress would soak
through in a couple of minutes, but she didn’t

1893
02:53:00,399 --> 02:53:07,609
care. She did wonder, though, if he noticed,
then thought he probably did.

1894
02:53:07,609 --> 02:53:12,950
She ran her hands through her hair, feeling
its wetness. It felt wonderful, she felt wonderful,

1895
02:53:12,950 --> 02:53:19,130
everything felt wonderful. Even through the
rain, she could hear him breathing hard and

1896
02:53:19,130 --> 02:53:24,430
the sound aroused her sexually in a way she
hadn’t felt in years.

1897
02:53:24,430 --> 02:53:29,361
A cloud burst directly above them, and the
rain began to come down even harder. Harder

1898
02:53:29,361 --> 02:53:34,859
than she’d ever seen it. Allie looked upward
and laughed, giving up any attempt at keeping

1899
02:53:34,859 --> 02:53:40,170
dry, making Noah feel better. He hadn’t
known how she was feeling about it. Even though

1900
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:44,280
she’d made the decision to come, he doubted
that she’d expected to be caught in a storm

1901
02:53:44,280 --> 02:53:46,520
like this.

1902
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:50,240
They reached the dock a couple of minutes
later, and Noah moved in close enough for

1903
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:54,750
Allie to step out. He helped her up, then
got out himself and dragged the canoe up the

1904
02:53:54,750 --> 02:54:00,359
bank far enough not to drift away. Just in
case, he tied it to the dock, knowing another

1905
02:54:00,359 --> 02:54:03,439
minute in the rain wouldn’t make any difference.

1906
02:54:03,439 --> 02:54:09,760
As he was tying the canoe, he looked up at
Allie and stopped breathing for just a second.

1907
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:15,890
She was incredibly beautiful as she waited,
watching him, completely comfortable in the

1908
02:54:15,890 --> 02:54:22,029
rain. She didn’t try to keep dry or hide
herself, and he could see the outline of her

1909
02:54:22,029 --> 02:54:27,779
breasts as they pressed through the fabric
of the dress that clung tightly to her body.

1910
02:54:27,779 --> 02:54:31,979
It wasn’t a cold rain, but he could see
her nipples erect and protruding, hard like

1911
02:54:31,979 --> 02:54:38,430
little rocks. He felt his loins begin to stir
and quickly turned away, embarrassed, muttering

1912
02:54:38,430 --> 02:54:46,170
to himself, glad the rain muffled any sound
of it. When he finished and stood, Allie took

1913
02:54:46,170 --> 02:54:51,600
his hand in hers, surprising him. Despite
the downpour, they didn’t rush toward the

1914
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:57,350
house, and Noah imagined what it would be
like to spend the night with her.

1915
02:54:57,350 --> 02:55:04,770
Allie, too, was wondering about him. She felt
the warmth in his hands and wondered what

1916
02:55:04,770 --> 02:55:10,600
it would be like to have them touch her body,
feeling all of her, lingering slowly across

1917
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:16,529
her skin. Just thinking about it made her
take a deep breath, and she felt her nipples

1918
02:55:16,529 --> 02:55:21,310
begin to tingle and a new warmth between her
legs.

1919
02:55:21,310 --> 02:55:27,319
She realized then that something had changed
since she’d come here. And although she

1920
02:55:27,319 --> 02:55:33,710
couldn’t pinpoint the exact time—yesterday
after dinner, or this afternoon in the canoe,

1921
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:39,010
or when they saw the swans, or maybe even
now as they walked holding hands—she knew

1922
02:55:39,010 --> 02:55:47,100
that she had fallen in love with Noah Taylor
Calhoun again, and that maybe, just maybe,

1923
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:51,970
she had never stopped.

1924
02:55:51,970 --> 02:55:57,250
There was no uneasiness between them as they
reached the door and both of them went inside,

1925
02:55:57,250 --> 02:55:59,540
pausing in the foyer, clothes dripping.

1926
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:02,939
“Did you bring a change of clothes?”

1927
02:56:02,939 --> 02:56:07,410
She shook her head, still feeling the roll
of emotions within her, wondering if it showed

1928
02:56:07,410 --> 02:56:08,439
on her face.

1929
02:56:08,439 --> 02:56:12,609
“I think I can find something here for you
so you can get out of those clothes. It might

1930
02:56:12,609 --> 02:56:15,239
be a little big, but it’s warm.”

1931
02:56:15,239 --> 02:56:16,239
“Anything,” she said.

1932
02:56:16,239 --> 02:56:19,160
“I’ll be back in a second.”

1933
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:23,580
Noah slipped off his boots, then ran up the
stairs, descending a minute later. He had

1934
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:27,930
a pair of cotton pants and a long-sleeved
shirt under one arm and some jeans with a

1935
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:29,580
blue shirt in the other.

1936
02:56:29,580 --> 02:56:33,880
“Here,” he said, handing her the cotton
pants and shirt. “You can change in the

1937
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:38,790
bedroom upstairs. There’s a bathroom and
towel up there too if you want to shower.”

1938
02:56:38,790 --> 02:56:44,470
She thanked him with a smile and went up the
stairs, feeling his eyes on her as she walked.

1939
02:56:44,470 --> 02:56:49,510
She entered the bedroom and closed the door,
then set the pants and shirt on his bed and

1940
02:56:49,510 --> 02:56:56,050
peeled everything off. Naked, she went to
his closet and found a hanger, put her dress,

1941
02:56:56,050 --> 02:57:00,020
bra, and panties on it, and then went to hang
it in the bathroom so it wouldn’t drip on

1942
02:57:00,020 --> 02:57:08,649
the hardwood floor. She felt a secret thrill
at being naked in the same room he slept in.

1943
02:57:08,649 --> 02:57:13,140
She didn’t want to shower after being in
the rain. She liked the soft feeling on her

1944
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:21,140
skin, and it reminded her of how people used
to live long ago. Naturally. Like Noah. She

1945
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:26,540
slipped on his clothes before looking at herself
in the mirror. The pants were big, but tucking

1946
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:31,430
in the shirt helped, and she rolled up the
bottoms just a little so they wouldn’t drag.

1947
02:57:31,430 --> 02:57:35,600
The neck was torn a little and it nearly hung
off one shoulder, but she liked the way it

1948
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:40,600
looked on her anyway. She pulled the sleeves
up almost to the elbows, went to the bureau,

1949
02:57:40,600 --> 02:57:45,200
and slipped on some socks, then went to the
bathroom to find a hairbrush.

1950
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:51,440
She brushed her wet hair just enough to get
out the snarls, letting it rest on her shoulders.

1951
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:56,479
Looking in the mirror, she wished she had
brought a clasp or a couple of hairpins.

1952
02:57:56,479 --> 02:58:01,569
And a little more mascara. But what could
she do? Her eyes still had a little of what

1953
02:58:01,569 --> 02:58:06,810
she’d put on earlier, and she touched up
with a washcloth, doing the best she could.

1954
02:58:06,810 --> 02:58:12,370
When she was finished, she checked herself
in the mirror, feeling pretty despite everything,

1955
02:58:12,370 --> 02:58:15,740
and went back down the stairs.

1956
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:21,310
Noah was in the living room squatting before
a fire, doing his best to coax it to life.

1957
02:58:21,310 --> 02:58:26,601
He didn’t see her come in, and she watched
him as he worked. He had changed his clothes

1958
02:58:26,601 --> 02:58:33,359
as well and looked good: his shoulders broad,
wet hair hanging just over his collar, jeans

1959
02:58:33,359 --> 02:58:34,359
tight.

1960
02:58:34,359 --> 02:58:39,930
He poked the fire, moving the logs, and added
some more kindling. Allie leaned against the

1961
02:58:39,930 --> 02:58:46,050
door-jamb, one leg crossed over the other,
and continued to watch him. In a few minutes

1962
02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:53,040
the fire had turned to flames, even and steady.
He turned to the side to straighten the remaining

1963
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:57,380
unused logs and caught a glimpse of her out
of the corner of his eye. He turned back to

1964
02:58:57,380 --> 02:58:59,430
her quickly.

1965
02:58:59,430 --> 02:59:06,431
Even in his clothes she looked beautiful.
After a moment he turned away shyly, going

1966
02:59:06,431 --> 02:59:08,200
back to stacking the logs.

1967
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:14,220
“I didn’t hear you come in,” he said,
trying to sound casual.

1968
02:59:14,220 --> 02:59:21,840
“I know. You weren’t supposed to.” She
knew what he had been thinking and felt a

1969
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:25,200
tinge of amusement at how young he seemed.

1970
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:28,399
“How long have you been standing there?”

1971
02:59:28,399 --> 02:59:31,420
“A couple of minutes.”

1972
02:59:31,420 --> 02:59:37,330
Noah brushed his hands on his pants, then
pointed to the kitchen. “Can I get you some

1973
02:59:37,330 --> 02:59:45,090
tea? I started the water while you were upstairs.”
Small talk, anything to keep his mind clear.

1974
02:59:45,090 --> 02:59:50,210
But damn, the way she looked . . .

1975
02:59:50,210 --> 02:59:56,420
She thought for a second, saw the way he was
looking at her, and felt the old instincts

1976
02:59:56,420 --> 02:59:57,840
take over.

1977
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:03,470
“Do you have anything stronger, or is it
too early to drink?”

1978
03:00:03,470 --> 03:00:07,971
He smiled. “I have some bourbon in the pantry.
Is that okay?”

1979
03:00:07,971 --> 03:00:10,600
“That sounds great.”

1980
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:14,930
He started toward the kitchen, and Allie watched
him run his hand through his wet hair as he

1981
03:00:14,930 --> 03:00:15,930
disappeared.

1982
03:00:15,930 --> 03:00:22,870
Thunder boomed loudly, and another downpour
started. Allie could hear the roaring of the

1983
03:00:22,870 --> 03:00:28,600
rain on the roof, could hear the snapping
of logs as the flickering flames lit the room.

1984
03:00:28,600 --> 03:00:34,220
She turned to the window and saw the gray
sky flash lighter for just a second. Moments

1985
03:00:34,220 --> 03:00:39,130
later, another boom of thunder. Close this
time.

1986
03:00:39,130 --> 03:00:45,260
She took a quilt from the sofa and sat on
the rug in front of the fire. Crossing her

1987
03:00:45,260 --> 03:00:50,890
legs, she adjusted the quilt until she was
comfortable and watched the dancing flames.

1988
03:00:50,890 --> 03:00:56,689
Noah came back, saw what she had done, and
went to sit beside her. He put down two glasses

1989
03:00:56,689 --> 03:01:02,080
and poured some bourbon into each of them.
Outside, the sky grew darker.

1990
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:09,630
Thunder again. Loud. The storm in full fury,
winds whipping the rain in circles.

1991
03:01:09,630 --> 03:01:15,970
“It’s quite a storm,” Noah said as he
watched the drops flow in vertical streams

1992
03:01:15,970 --> 03:01:22,200
on the windows. He and Allie were close now,
though not touching, and Noah watched her

1993
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:28,430
chest rise slightly with every breath, imagining
the feel of her body once again before fighting

1994
03:01:28,430 --> 03:01:29,430
it back.

1995
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:35,930
“I like it,” she said, taking a sip. “I’ve
always liked thunderstorms. Even as a young

1996
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:36,930
girl.”

1997
03:01:36,930 --> 03:01:41,290
“Why?” Saying anything, keeping his balance.

1998
03:01:41,290 --> 03:01:49,090
“I don’t know. They just always seemed
romantic to me.”

1999
03:01:49,090 --> 03:01:55,380
She was quiet for a moment, and Noah watched
the fire flicker in her emerald eyes. Then

2000
03:01:55,380 --> 03:02:00,510
she said, “Do you remember sitting together
and watching the storm a few nights before

2001
03:02:00,510 --> 03:02:01,750
I left?”

2002
03:02:01,750 --> 03:02:03,390
“Of course.”

2003
03:02:03,390 --> 03:02:09,020
“I used to think about it all the time after
I went home. I always thought about how you

2004
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:13,439
looked that night. It was the way I always
remembered you.”

2005
03:02:13,439 --> 03:02:16,700
“Have I changed much?”

2006
03:02:16,700 --> 03:02:22,460
She took another sip of bourbon, feeling it
warm her. She touched his hand as she answered.

2007
03:02:22,460 --> 03:02:28,060
“Not really. Not in the things that I remember.
You’re older, of course, with more life

2008
03:02:28,060 --> 03:02:34,510
behind you, but you’ve still got the same
gleam in your eye. You still read poetry and

2009
03:02:34,510 --> 03:02:39,060
float on rivers. And you’ve still got a
gentleness that not even the war could take

2010
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:42,410
away.”

2011
03:02:42,410 --> 03:02:46,891
He thought about what she’d said and felt
her hand lingering on his, her thumb tracing

2012
03:02:46,891 --> 03:02:49,729
slow circles.

2013
03:02:49,729 --> 03:03:00,050
“Allie, you asked me earlier what I remembered
most about the summer. What do you remember?”

2014
03:03:00,050 --> 03:03:05,910
It was a while before she answered. Her voice
seemed to come from somewhere else.

2015
03:03:05,910 --> 03:03:15,149
“I remember making love. That’s what I
remember most. You were my first, and it was

2016
03:03:15,149 --> 03:03:20,390
more wonderful than I ever thought it would
be.”

2017
03:03:20,390 --> 03:03:26,689
Noah took a drink of bourbon, remembering,
bringing back the old feelings again, then

2018
03:03:26,689 --> 03:03:33,330
suddenly shook his head. This was already
hard enough. She went on.

2019
03:03:33,330 --> 03:03:39,560
“I remember being so afraid beforehand that
I was trembling, but at the same time being

2020
03:03:39,560 --> 03:03:47,310
so excited. I’m glad you were the first.
I’m glad we were able to share that.”

2021
03:03:47,310 --> 03:03:49,350
“Me too.”

2022
03:03:49,350 --> 03:03:53,970
“Were you as afraid as I was?”

2023
03:03:53,970 --> 03:03:57,170
Noah nodded without speaking, and she smiled
at his honesty.

2024
03:03:57,170 --> 03:04:04,530
“I thought so. You were always shy like
that. Especially in the beginning. I remember

2025
03:04:04,530 --> 03:04:08,290
you had asked if I had a boyfriend, and when
I said I did, you barely talked to me anymore.”

2026
03:04:08,290 --> 03:04:14,670
“I didn’t want to get between the two
of you.” “You did, though, in the end,

2027
03:04:14,670 --> 03:04:22,830
despite your professed innocence,” she said,
smiling. “And I’m glad you did.”

2028
03:04:22,830 --> 03:04:26,170
“When did you finally tell him about us?”

2029
03:04:26,170 --> 03:04:28,310
“After I got home.”

2030
03:04:28,310 --> 03:04:29,920
“Was it hard?”

2031
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:34,720
“Not at all. I was in love with you.”

2032
03:04:34,720 --> 03:04:42,220
She squeezed his hand, let go, and moved closer.
She put her hand through his arm, cradling

2033
03:04:42,220 --> 03:04:51,460
it, and rested her head on his shoulder. He
could smell her, soft like the rain, warm.

2034
03:04:51,460 --> 03:04:53,300
She spoke quietly:

2035
03:04:53,300 --> 03:05:00,220
“Do you remember walking home after the
festival? I asked you if you wanted to see

2036
03:05:00,220 --> 03:05:06,550
me again. You just nodded your head and didn’t
say a word. It wasn’t too convincing.”

2037
03:05:06,550 --> 03:05:11,930
“I’d never met anyone like you before.
I couldn’t help it. I didn’t know what

2038
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:13,140
to say.”

2039
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:20,510
“I know. You could never hide anything.
Your eyes always gave you away. You had the

2040
03:05:20,510 --> 03:05:25,220
most wonderful eyes I’d ever seen.”

2041
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:31,229
She paused then, lifted her head from his
shoulder, and looked directly at him. When

2042
03:05:31,229 --> 03:05:40,430
she spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper.
“I think I loved you more that summer than

2043
03:05:40,430 --> 03:05:44,529
I ever loved anyone.”

2044
03:05:44,529 --> 03:05:50,340
Lightning flashed again. In the quiet moments
before the thunder, their eyes met as they

2045
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:57,640
tried to undo the fourteen years, both of
them sensing a change since yesterday. When

2046
03:05:57,640 --> 03:06:03,229
the thunder finally sounded, Noah sighed and
turned from her, toward the windows.

2047
03:06:03,229 --> 03:06:09,160
“I wish you could have read the letters
I wrote you,” he said.

2048
03:06:09,160 --> 03:06:11,270
She didn’t speak for a long while.

2049
03:06:11,270 --> 03:06:17,220
“It wasn’t just up to you, Noah. I didn’t
tell you, but I wrote you a dozen letters

2050
03:06:17,220 --> 03:06:20,930
after I got home. I just never sent them.”

2051
03:06:20,930 --> 03:06:27,569
“Why?” Noah was surprised. “I guess
I was too afraid.” “Of what?”

2052
03:06:27,569 --> 03:06:33,029
“That maybe it wasn’t as real as I thought
it was. That maybe you forgot me.”

2053
03:06:33,029 --> 03:06:40,450
“I would never do that. I couldn’t even
think it.” “I know that now. I can see

2054
03:06:40,450 --> 03:06:46,600
it when I look at you. But back then, it was
different. There was so much I didn’t understand,

2055
03:06:46,600 --> 03:06:49,880
things that a young girl’s mind couldn’t
sort out.”

2056
03:06:49,880 --> 03:06:52,330
“What do you mean?”

2057
03:06:52,330 --> 03:06:54,990
She paused, collecting her thoughts.

2058
03:06:54,990 --> 03:07:00,680
“When your letters never came, I didn’t
know what to think. I remember talking to

2059
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:05,950
my best friend about what happened that summer,
and she said that you got what you wanted,

2060
03:07:05,950 --> 03:07:10,750
and that she wasn’t surprised that you wouldn’t
write. I didn’t believe that you were that

2061
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:15,880
way, I never did, but hearing it and thinking
about all our differences made me wonder if

2062
03:07:15,880 --> 03:07:21,439
maybe the summer meant more to me than it
had meant to you. . . . And then, while all

2063
03:07:21,439 --> 03:07:28,061
this was going through my head, I heard from
Sarah. She said that you had left New Bern.”

2064
03:07:28,061 --> 03:07:32,120
“Fin and Sarah always knew where I was—”

2065
03:07:32,120 --> 03:07:37,350
She held up her hand to stop him. “I know,
but I never asked. I assumed that you had

2066
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:42,560
left New Bern to start a new life, one without
me. Why else wouldn’t you write? Or call?

2067
03:07:42,560 --> 03:07:45,830
Or come see me?”

2068
03:07:45,830 --> 03:07:49,650
Noah looked away without answering, and she
continued:

2069
03:07:49,650 --> 03:07:56,479
“I didn’t know, and in time, the hurt
began to fade and it was easier to just let

2070
03:07:56,479 --> 03:08:04,450
it go. At least I thought it was. But in every
boy I met in the next few years, I found myself

2071
03:08:04,450 --> 03:08:10,170
looking for you, and when the feelings got
too strong, I’d write you another letter.

2072
03:08:10,170 --> 03:08:15,660
But I never sent them for fear of what I might
find. By then, you’d gone on with your life

2073
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:20,830
and I didn’t want to think about you loving
someone else. I wanted to remember us like

2074
03:08:20,830 --> 03:08:28,050
we were that summer. I didn’t want to ever
lose that.”

2075
03:08:28,050 --> 03:08:34,930
She said it so sweetly, so innocently, that
Noah wanted to kiss her when she finished.

2076
03:08:34,930 --> 03:08:39,590
But he didn’t. Instead he fought the urge
and pushed it back, knowing it wasn’t what

2077
03:08:39,590 --> 03:08:45,359
she needed. Yet she felt so wonderful to him,
touching him. . . .

2078
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:50,189
“The last letter I wrote was a couple of
years ago. After I met Lon, I wrote to your

2079
03:08:50,189 --> 03:08:54,770
daddy to find out where you were. But it had
been so long since I’d seen you, I wasn’t

2080
03:08:54,770 --> 03:09:00,060
even sure he’d still be there. And with
the war . . .”

2081
03:09:00,060 --> 03:09:07,171
She trailed off, and they were quiet for a
moment, both of them lost in thought. Lightning

2082
03:09:07,171 --> 03:09:11,350
lit the sky again before Noah finally broke
the silence.

2083
03:09:11,350 --> 03:09:15,040
“I wish you would have mailed it anyway.”
“Why?”

2084
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:20,109
“Just to hear from you. To hear what you’ve
been up to.”

2085
03:09:20,109 --> 03:09:26,300
“You might have been disappointed. My life
isn’t too exciting. Besides, I’m not exactly

2086
03:09:26,300 --> 03:09:27,790
what you remembered.”

2087
03:09:27,790 --> 03:09:34,080
“You’re better than I remembered, Allie.”
“You’re sweet, Noah.”

2088
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:39,060
He almost stopped there, knowing that if he
kept the words inside him, he could somehow

2089
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:45,260
keep control, the same control he had kept
the past fourteen years. But something else

2090
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:50,489
had overtaken him now, and he gave in to it,
hoping somehow, in some way, it would take

2091
03:09:50,489 --> 03:09:53,210
them back to what they’d had so long ago.

2092
03:09:53,210 --> 03:09:59,020
“I’m not saying it because I’m sweet.
I’m saying it because I love you now and

2093
03:09:59,020 --> 03:10:02,840
I always have. More than you can imagine.”

2094
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:09,859
A log snapped, sending sparks up the chimney,
and both of them noticed the smoldering remains,

2095
03:10:09,859 --> 03:10:16,310
almost burned through. The fire needed another
log, but neither of them moved.

2096
03:10:16,310 --> 03:10:19,979
Allie took another sip of bourbon and began
to feel its effects. But it wasn’t just

2097
03:10:19,979 --> 03:10:25,681
the alcohol that made her hold Noah a little
tighter and feel his warmth against her. Glancing

2098
03:10:25,681 --> 03:10:29,050
out the window, she saw the clouds were almost
black.

2099
03:10:29,050 --> 03:10:38,070
“Let me get the fire going again,” Noah
said, needing to think, and she released him.

2100
03:10:38,070 --> 03:10:42,770
He went to the fireplace, opened the screen,
and added a couple of logs. He used the poker

2101
03:10:42,770 --> 03:10:47,680
to adjust the burning wood, making sure the
new wood could catch easily.

2102
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:53,140
The flame began to spread again, and Noah
returned to her side. She snuggled up against

2103
03:10:53,140 --> 03:10:57,989
him again, resting her head on his shoulder
as she had before, not speaking, rubbing her

2104
03:10:57,989 --> 03:11:03,790
hand lightly against his chest. Noah leaned
closer and whispered in her ear.

2105
03:11:03,790 --> 03:11:10,680
“This reminds me of how we once were. When
we were young.”

2106
03:11:10,680 --> 03:11:18,130
She smiled, thinking the same thing, and they
watched the fire and smoke, holding each other.

2107
03:11:18,130 --> 03:11:25,600
“Noah, you’ve never asked, but I want
you to know something.”

2108
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:28,029
“What is it?”

2109
03:11:28,029 --> 03:11:29,910
Her voice was tender.

2110
03:11:29,910 --> 03:11:36,180
“There’s never been another, Noah. You
weren’t just the first. You’re the only

2111
03:11:36,180 --> 03:11:41,630
man I’ve ever been with. I don’t expect
you to say the same thing, but I wanted you

2112
03:11:41,630 --> 03:11:45,920
to know.”

2113
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:52,720
Noah was silent as he turned away. She felt
warmer as she watched the fire. Her hand ran

2114
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:59,720
over the muscles beneath his shirt, hard and
firm as they leaned against each other.

2115
03:11:59,720 --> 03:12:02,851
She remembered when they’d held each other
like this for what they’d thought would

2116
03:12:02,851 --> 03:12:09,210
be the last time. They were sitting on a sea
wall designed to hold back the waters of the

2117
03:12:09,210 --> 03:12:14,180
Neuse River. She was crying because they might
never see each other again, and she wondered

2118
03:12:14,180 --> 03:12:21,310
how she could ever be happy again. Instead
of answering, he pressed a note into her hand,

2119
03:12:21,310 --> 03:12:27,560
which she read on the way home. She had saved
it, occasionally reading all of it or sometimes

2120
03:12:27,560 --> 03:12:34,350
just a part. One part she’d read at least
a hundred times, and for some reason it ran

2121
03:12:34,350 --> 03:12:38,700
through her head now. It said:

2122
03:12:38,700 --> 03:12:45,450
The reason it hurts so much to separate is
because our souls are connected. Maybe they

2123
03:12:45,450 --> 03:12:51,939
always have been and will be. Maybe we’ve
lived a thousand lives before this one and

2124
03:12:51,939 --> 03:12:55,561
in
each of them we’ve found each other. And

2125
03:12:55,561 --> 03:13:01,720
maybe each time, we’ve been forced apart
for the same reasons. That means that this

2126
03:13:01,720 --> 03:13:07,130
goodbye is both a good-bye for the past ten
thousand years and a prelude to what will

2127
03:13:07,130 --> 03:13:12,680
come.
When I look at you, I see your beauty and

2128
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:19,430
grace and know they have grown stronger with
every life you have lived. And I know I have

2129
03:13:19,430 --> 03:13:26,440
spent every life before this one searching
for you. Not someone like you, but you, for

2130
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:32,609
your soul and mine must always come together.
And then, for a reason neither of us understands,

2131
03:13:32,609 --> 03:13:37,680
we’ve been forced to say good-bye.
I would love to tell you that everything will

2132
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:43,720
work out for us, and I promise to do all I
can to make sure it does. But if we never

2133
03:13:43,720 --> 03:13:50,600
meet again and this is truly good-bye, I know
we will see each other again in another life.

2134
03:13:50,600 --> 03:13:56,810
We will find each other again, and maybe the
stars will have changed, and we will not only

2135
03:13:56,810 --> 03:14:03,470
love each other in that time, but for all
the times we’ve had before.

2136
03:14:03,470 --> 03:14:14,359
Could it be? she wondered. Could he be right?
She had never completely discounted it, wanting

2137
03:14:14,359 --> 03:14:20,930
to hold on to its promise in case it was true.
The idea had helped her through many hard

2138
03:14:20,930 --> 03:14:26,590
times. But sitting here now seemed to test
the theory that they were destined to always

2139
03:14:26,590 --> 03:14:34,740
be apart. Unless the stars had changed since
they were last together.

2140
03:14:34,740 --> 03:14:38,970
And maybe they had, but she didn’t want
to look.

2141
03:14:38,970 --> 03:14:45,200
Instead she leaned into him and felt the heat
between them, felt his body, felt his arm

2142
03:14:45,200 --> 03:14:51,750
tight around her. And her body began to tremble
with the same anticipation she had felt the

2143
03:14:51,750 --> 03:14:54,939
first time they were together.

2144
03:14:54,939 --> 03:15:02,720
It felt so right to be here. Everything felt
right. The fire, the drinks, the storm—it

2145
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:10,939
couldn’t have been more perfect. Like magic,
it seemed, their years apart didn’t matter

2146
03:15:10,939 --> 03:15:12,100
anymore.

2147
03:15:12,100 --> 03:15:18,739
Lightning cut the sky outside. Fire danced
on white-hot wood, spreading the heat. October

2148
03:15:18,739 --> 03:15:23,640
rain sheeted itself against the windows, drowning
out all other sounds.

2149
03:15:23,640 --> 03:15:33,939
They gave in then to everything they had fought
the last fourteen years. Allie lifted her

2150
03:15:33,939 --> 03:15:41,109
head off his shoulder, looked at him with
hazy eyes, and Noah kissed her softly on the

2151
03:15:41,109 --> 03:15:46,810
lips. She brought her hand to his face and
touched his cheek, brushing it softly with

2152
03:15:46,810 --> 03:15:53,500
her fingers. He leaned in slowly and kissed
her again, still soft and tender, and she

2153
03:15:53,500 --> 03:16:01,830
kissed back, feeling the years of separation
dissolve into passion.

2154
03:16:01,830 --> 03:16:07,640
She closed her eyes and parted her lips as
he ran his fingers up and down her arms, slowly,

2155
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:13,399
lightly. He kissed her neck, her cheek, her
eyelids, and she felt the moisture of his

2156
03:16:13,399 --> 03:16:19,350
mouth linger wherever his lips had touched.
She took his hand and led it to her breasts,

2157
03:16:19,350 --> 03:16:23,609
and a whimper rose in her throat as he gently
touched them through the thin fabric of the

2158
03:16:23,609 --> 03:16:27,069
shirt.

2159
03:16:27,069 --> 03:16:35,140
The world seemed dreamlike as she pulled back
from him, the firelight setting her face aglow.

2160
03:16:35,140 --> 03:16:41,170
Without speaking, she started to undo the
buttons on his shirt. He watched her as she

2161
03:16:41,170 --> 03:16:46,580
did it and listened to her soft breaths as
she made her way downward. With each button

2162
03:16:46,580 --> 03:16:51,210
he could feel her fingers brushing against
his skin, and she smiled softly at him when

2163
03:16:51,210 --> 03:16:58,260
she finally finished. He felt her slide her
hands inside, touching him as lightly as possible,

2164
03:16:58,260 --> 03:17:03,370
letting her hands explore his body. He was
hot and she ran her hand over his slightly

2165
03:17:03,370 --> 03:17:09,430
wet chest, feeling his hair between her fingers.
Leaning in, she kissed his neck gently as

2166
03:17:09,430 --> 03:17:15,350
she pulled the shirt over his shoulders, locking
his arms behind his back. She lifted her head

2167
03:17:15,350 --> 03:17:21,910
and allowed him to kiss her as he rolled his
shoulders, freeing himself from the sleeves.

2168
03:17:21,910 --> 03:17:27,720
With that, he slowly reached for her. He lifted
her shirt and ran his finger slowly across

2169
03:17:27,720 --> 03:17:33,650
her belly before raising her arms and slipping
it off. She felt short of breath as he lowered

2170
03:17:33,650 --> 03:17:38,930
his head and kissed between her breasts and
slowly ran his tongue up to her neck. His

2171
03:17:38,930 --> 03:17:44,279
hands gently caressed her back, her arms,
her shoulders, and she felt their heated bodies

2172
03:17:44,279 --> 03:17:51,220
press together, skin to skin. He kissed her
neck and nibbled gently as she lifted her

2173
03:17:51,220 --> 03:17:56,600
hips and allowed him to pull off her bottoms.
She reached for the snap on his jeans, undid

2174
03:17:56,600 --> 03:18:03,420
it, and watched as he slipped them off as
well. It was almost slow motion as their naked

2175
03:18:03,420 --> 03:18:08,080
bodies finally came together, both of them
trembling with the memory of what they had

2176
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:10,560
once shared together.

2177
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:14,750
He ran his tongue along her neck while his
hands moved over the smooth hot skin of her

2178
03:18:14,750 --> 03:18:21,000
breasts, down her belly, past her navel, and
up again. He was struck by her beauty. Her

2179
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:26,580
shimmering hair trapped the light and made
it sparkle. Her skin was soft and beautiful,

2180
03:18:26,580 --> 03:18:31,550
almost glowing in the firelight. He felt her
hands on his back, beckoning him.

2181
03:18:31,550 --> 03:18:38,040
They lay back, close to the fire, and the
heat made the air seem thick. Her back was

2182
03:18:38,040 --> 03:18:43,449
slightly arched as he rolled atop her in one
fluid motion. He was on all fours above her,

2183
03:18:43,449 --> 03:18:49,609
his knees astride her hips. She lifted her
head and kissed his chin and neck, breathing

2184
03:18:49,609 --> 03:18:55,880
hard, licking his shoulders, and tasting the
sweat that lingered on his body. She ran her

2185
03:18:55,880 --> 03:19:01,220
hands through his hair as he held himself
above her, his arm muscles hard from the exertion.

2186
03:19:01,220 --> 03:19:06,030
With a little tempting frown, she pulled him
closer, but he resisted. Instead he lowered

2187
03:19:06,030 --> 03:19:12,470
himself and lightly rubbed his chest against
her, and she felt her body respond with anticipation.

2188
03:19:12,470 --> 03:19:19,109
He did this slowly, over and over, kissing
every part of her body, listening as she made

2189
03:19:19,109 --> 03:19:22,460
soft, whimpering sounds while he moved above
her.

2190
03:19:22,460 --> 03:19:27,450
He did this until she couldn’t take it anymore,
and when they finally joined as one, she cried

2191
03:19:27,450 --> 03:19:32,561
aloud and pressed her fingers hard into his
back. She buried her face in his neck and

2192
03:19:32,561 --> 03:19:39,420
felt him deep inside her, felt his strength
and gentleness, felt his muscle and his soul.

2193
03:19:39,420 --> 03:19:43,940
She moved rhythmically against him, allowing
him to take her wherever he wanted, to the

2194
03:19:43,940 --> 03:19:47,570
place she was meant to be.

2195
03:19:47,570 --> 03:19:51,739
She opened her eyes and watched him in the
firelight, marveling at his beauty as he moved

2196
03:19:51,739 --> 03:19:57,660
above her. She saw his body glisten with crystal
sweat and watched as beads rolled down his

2197
03:19:57,660 --> 03:20:04,120
chest and fell onto her like the rain outside.
And with every drop, with every breath, she

2198
03:20:04,120 --> 03:20:12,530
felt herself, every responsibility, every
facet of her life, slipping away.

2199
03:20:12,530 --> 03:20:19,239
Their bodies reflected everything given, everything
taken, and she was rewarded with a sensation

2200
03:20:19,239 --> 03:20:24,270
she never knew existed. It went on and on,
tingling throughout her body and warming her

2201
03:20:24,270 --> 03:20:29,109
before finally subsiding, and she struggled
to catch her breath while she trembled beneath

2202
03:20:29,109 --> 03:20:33,360
him. But the moment it was over, another one
started to build again, and she started to

2203
03:20:33,360 --> 03:20:39,520
feel them in long sequences, one right after
the next. By the time the rain had stopped

2204
03:20:39,520 --> 03:20:45,710
and the sun had set, her body was exhausted
but unwilling to stop the pleasure between

2205
03:20:45,710 --> 03:20:47,810
them.

2206
03:20:47,810 --> 03:20:52,340
They spent the day in each other’s arms,
alternately making love by the fire and then

2207
03:20:52,340 --> 03:20:57,800
holding each other as they watched the flames
curl around the wood. Sometimes he recited

2208
03:20:57,800 --> 03:21:03,010
one of his favorite poems as she lay beside
him, and she would listen with her eyes closed

2209
03:21:03,010 --> 03:21:09,939
and almost feel the words. Then, when they
were ready, they would join again and he murmured

2210
03:21:09,939 --> 03:21:15,939
words of love between kisses as they wrapped
their arms around one another.

2211
03:21:15,939 --> 03:21:21,521
They went on throughout the evening, making
up for their years apart, and slept in each

2212
03:21:21,521 --> 03:21:28,029
other’s arms that night. Occasionally he
would wake up and look at her, her body spent

2213
03:21:28,029 --> 03:21:33,560
and radiant, and feel as if everything were
suddenly right in this world.

2214
03:21:33,560 --> 03:21:39,180
Once, when he was looking at her in the moments
before daybreak, her eyes fluttered open and

2215
03:21:39,180 --> 03:21:44,760
she smiled and reached up to touch his face.
He put his fingers to her lips, gently, to

2216
03:21:44,760 --> 03:21:50,100
keep her from speaking, and for a long time
they just looked at one another.

2217
03:21:50,100 --> 03:21:56,310
When the lump in his throat subsided, he whispered
to her, “You are the answer to every prayer

2218
03:21:56,310 --> 03:22:03,720
I’ve offered. You are a song, a dream, a
whisper, and I don’t know how I could have

2219
03:22:03,720 --> 03:22:08,740
lived without you for as long as I have. I
love you, Allie, more than you can ever imagine.

2220
03:22:08,740 --> 03:22:13,790
I always have, and I always will.”

2221
03:22:13,790 --> 03:22:24,780
“Oh, Noah,” she said, pulling him to her.
She wanted him, needed him now more than ever,

2222
03:22:24,780 --> 03:22:32,410
like nothing she’d ever known.

2223
03:22:32,410 --> 03:22:35,300
Courtrooms

2224
03:22:35,300 --> 03:22:40,680
Later that morning, three men—two lawyers
and the judge—sat in chambers while Lon

2225
03:22:40,680 --> 03:22:45,400
finished speaking. It was a moment before
the judge answered.

2226
03:22:45,400 --> 03:22:52,021
“It’s an unusual request,” he said,
pondering the situation. “It seems to me

2227
03:22:52,021 --> 03:22:56,891
the trial could very well end today. Are you
saying this urgent matter can’t wait until

2228
03:22:56,891 --> 03:22:58,800
later this evening or tomorrow?”

2229
03:22:58,800 --> 03:23:04,970
“No, Your Honor, it can’t,” Lon answered
almost too quickly. Stay relaxed, he told

2230
03:23:04,970 --> 03:23:06,630
himself. Take a deep breath.

2231
03:23:06,630 --> 03:23:09,250
“And it has nothing to do with this case?”

2232
03:23:09,250 --> 03:23:13,359
“No, Your Honor. It’s of a personal nature.
I know it’s out of the ordinary, but I really

2233
03:23:13,359 --> 03:23:17,479
need to take care of it.” Good, better.

2234
03:23:17,479 --> 03:23:22,430
The judge leaned back in his chair, evaluating
him for a moment. “Mr. Bates, how do you

2235
03:23:22,430 --> 03:23:24,470
feel about this?”

2236
03:23:24,470 --> 03:23:28,640
He cleared his throat. “Mr. Hammond called
me this morning and I’ve already spoken

2237
03:23:28,640 --> 03:23:30,970
to my clients. They’re willing to postpone
until Monday.”

2238
03:23:30,970 --> 03:23:37,609
“I see,” the judge said. “And do you
believe it is in your clients’ best interests

2239
03:23:37,609 --> 03:23:38,930
to do this?”

2240
03:23:38,930 --> 03:23:43,600
“I believe so,” he said. “Mr. Hammond
has agreed to reopen discussion on a certain

2241
03:23:43,600 --> 03:23:46,810
matter not covered by this proceeding.”

2242
03:23:46,810 --> 03:23:49,890
The judge looked hard at both of them and
thought about it.

2243
03:23:49,890 --> 03:23:55,640
“I don’t like it,” he finally said,
“not at all. But Mr. Hammond has never made

2244
03:23:55,640 --> 03:24:00,050
a similar request before, and I assume the
matter is very important to him.”

2245
03:24:00,050 --> 03:24:06,420
He paused for effect, then looked to some
papers on his desk. “I’ll agree to adjourn

2246
03:24:06,420 --> 03:24:08,199
until Monday. Nine o’clock sharp.”

2247
03:24:08,199 --> 03:24:12,279
“Thank you, Your Honor,” Lon said.

2248
03:24:12,279 --> 03:24:17,870
Two minutes later he was leaving the courthouse.
He walked to the car he had parked directly

2249
03:24:17,870 --> 03:24:25,310
across the street, got in, and began the drive
to New Bern, his hands shaking.

2250
03:24:25,310 --> 03:24:33,500
An Unexpected Visitor
Noah made breakfast for Allie while she slept

2251
03:24:33,500 --> 03:24:39,180
in the living room. Bacon, biscuits, and coffee,
nothing spectacular. He set the tray beside

2252
03:24:39,180 --> 03:24:43,950
her as she woke up, and as soon as they had
finished eating, they made love again. It

2253
03:24:43,950 --> 03:24:49,720
was relentless, a powerful confirmation of
what they had shared the day before. Allie

2254
03:24:49,720 --> 03:24:55,540
arched her back and cried out fiercely in
the final tidal wave of sensations, then wrapped

2255
03:24:55,540 --> 03:25:00,090
her arms around him as they breathed in unison,
exhausted.

2256
03:25:00,090 --> 03:25:05,930
They showered together, and afterward Allie
put on her dress, which had dried overnight.

2257
03:25:05,930 --> 03:25:11,010
She spent the morning with Noah. Together
they fed Clem and checked the windows to make

2258
03:25:11,010 --> 03:25:17,560
sure no damage had been done in the storm.
Two pine trees had blown over, though neither

2259
03:25:17,560 --> 03:25:22,380
had caused much damage, and a few shingles
had blown off the shed, but other than that,

2260
03:25:22,380 --> 03:25:26,040
the property had escaped pretty much unscathed.

2261
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:30,570
He held her hand most of the morning and the
two talked easily, but sometimes he would

2262
03:25:30,570 --> 03:25:36,350
stop speaking and just stare at her. When
he did, she felt as though she should say

2263
03:25:36,350 --> 03:25:42,330
something, but nothing meaningful ever came
into her head. Lost in thought, she usually

2264
03:25:42,330 --> 03:25:45,020
just kissed him.

2265
03:25:45,020 --> 03:25:50,120
A little before noon, Noah and Allie went
in to prepare lunch. Both of them were starving

2266
03:25:50,120 --> 03:25:54,680
again because they hadn’t eaten much the
day before. Using what he had on hand, they

2267
03:25:54,680 --> 03:25:59,000
fried some chicken and baked another batch
of biscuits, and the two of them ate on the

2268
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:02,250
porch, serenaded by a mockingbird.

2269
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:08,720
While they were inside doing the dishes, they
heard a knock at the door. Noah left Allie

2270
03:26:08,720 --> 03:26:10,640
in the kitchen.

2271
03:26:10,640 --> 03:26:11,640
Knock again.

2272
03:26:11,640 --> 03:26:14,290
“I’m coming,” Noah said.

2273
03:26:14,290 --> 03:26:16,490
Knock, knock. Louder.

2274
03:26:16,490 --> 03:26:17,890
He approached the door.

2275
03:26:17,890 --> 03:26:19,090
Knock, knock.

2276
03:26:19,090 --> 03:26:26,930
“I’m coming,” he said again as he opened
the door. “Oh, my God.”

2277
03:26:26,930 --> 03:26:33,261
He stared for a moment at a beautiful woman
in her early fifties, a woman he would have

2278
03:26:33,261 --> 03:26:36,130
recognized anywhere.

2279
03:26:36,130 --> 03:26:38,229
Noah couldn’t speak.

2280
03:26:38,229 --> 03:26:43,279
“Hello, Noah,” she finally said. Noah
said nothing.

2281
03:26:43,279 --> 03:26:49,700
“May I come in?” she asked, her voice
steady, revealing nothing.

2282
03:26:49,700 --> 03:26:54,489
He stammered out a reply as she walked past
him, stopping just before the stairs.

2283
03:26:54,489 --> 03:27:00,439
“Who is it?” Allie shouted from the kitchen,
and the woman turned at the sound of her voice.

2284
03:27:00,439 --> 03:27:07,010
“It’s your mother,” Noah finally answered,
and immediately after he said it, he heard

2285
03:27:07,010 --> 03:27:10,630
the sound of breaking glass.

2286
03:27:10,630 --> 03:27:17,030
“I knew you would be here,” Anne Nelson
said to her daughter as the three of them

2287
03:27:17,030 --> 03:27:19,600
sat around the coffee table in the living
room.

2288
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:21,850
“How could you be so sure?”

2289
03:27:21,850 --> 03:27:27,720
“You’re my daughter. One day when you
have kids of your own, you’ll know the answer.”

2290
03:27:27,720 --> 03:27:33,420
She smiled, but her manner was stiff, and
Noah imagined how difficult this must be for

2291
03:27:33,420 --> 03:27:40,540
her. “I saw the article, too, and I saw
your reaction. I also saw how tense you’ve

2292
03:27:40,540 --> 03:27:44,010
been during the last couple of weeks, and
when you said you were going shopping near

2293
03:27:44,010 --> 03:27:47,660
the coast, I knew exactly what you meant.”

2294
03:27:47,660 --> 03:27:50,550
“What about Daddy?”

2295
03:27:50,550 --> 03:27:54,930
Anne Nelson shook her head. “No, I didn’t
tell your father or anyone else about it.

2296
03:27:54,930 --> 03:27:59,410
Nor did I tell anyone where I was going today.”

2297
03:27:59,410 --> 03:28:04,649
The table was silent for a moment as they
wondered what was coming next, but Anne remained

2298
03:28:04,649 --> 03:28:05,649
quiet.

2299
03:28:05,649 --> 03:28:10,880
“Why did you come?” Allie finally asked.

2300
03:28:10,880 --> 03:28:17,220
Her mother raised an eyebrow. “I thought
I would be the one to ask that question.”

2301
03:28:17,220 --> 03:28:18,350
Allie paled.

2302
03:28:18,350 --> 03:28:23,650
“I came because I had to,” her mother
said, “which I’m sure is the same reason

2303
03:28:23,650 --> 03:28:26,229
you came. Am I right?”

2304
03:28:26,229 --> 03:28:28,170
Allie nodded.

2305
03:28:28,170 --> 03:28:35,350
Anne turned to Noah. “These last couple
of days must have been full of surprises.”

2306
03:28:35,350 --> 03:28:42,671
“Yes,” he answered simply, and she smiled
at him. “I know you don’t think so, but

2307
03:28:42,671 --> 03:28:47,811
I always liked you, Noah. I just didn’t
think you were right for my daughter. Can

2308
03:28:47,811 --> 03:28:50,520
you understand that?”

2309
03:28:50,520 --> 03:28:56,899
He shook his head as he answered, his tone
serious. “No, not really. It wasn’t fair

2310
03:28:56,899 --> 03:29:03,180
to me, and it wasn’t fair to Allie. Otherwise
she wouldn’t be here.”

2311
03:29:03,180 --> 03:29:09,220
She watched him as he answered, but she said
nothing. Allie, sensing an argument, cut in:

2312
03:29:09,220 --> 03:29:13,560
“What do you mean when you say you had to
come? Don’t you trust me?”

2313
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:19,810
Anne turned back to her daughter. “This
has nothing to do with trust. This has to

2314
03:29:19,810 --> 03:29:24,890
do with Lon. He called the house last night
to talk to me about Noah, and he’s on his

2315
03:29:24,890 --> 03:29:32,540
way here right now. He seemed very upset.
I thought you’d want to know.”

2316
03:29:32,540 --> 03:29:35,689
Allie inhaled sharply. “He’s on his way?”

2317
03:29:35,689 --> 03:29:42,270
“As we speak. He arranged to have the trial
postponed until next week. If he’s not in

2318
03:29:42,270 --> 03:29:43,990
New Bern yet, he’s close.”

2319
03:29:43,990 --> 03:29:46,120
“What did you say to him?”

2320
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:51,560
“Not much. But he knew. He had it all figured
out. He remembered my telling him about Noah

2321
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:54,479
a long time ago.”

2322
03:29:54,479 --> 03:29:58,640
Allie swallowed hard. “Did you tell him
I was here?”

2323
03:29:58,640 --> 03:30:05,060
“No. And I won’t. That’s between you
and him. But knowing him, I’m sure he’ll

2324
03:30:05,060 --> 03:30:10,050
find you here if you stay. All it takes is
a couple of phone calls to the right people.

2325
03:30:10,050 --> 03:30:12,149
After all, I was able to find you.”

2326
03:30:12,149 --> 03:30:20,460
Allie, though obviously worried, smiled at
her mother. “Thank you,” she said, and

2327
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:22,390
her mother reached for her hand.

2328
03:30:22,390 --> 03:30:28,310
“I know we’ve had our differences, Allie,
and that we haven’t seen eye to eye on everything.

2329
03:30:28,310 --> 03:30:32,850
I’m not perfect, but I did the best I could
with raising you. I’m your mother and I

2330
03:30:32,850 --> 03:30:37,720
always will be. That means I’ll always love
you.”

2331
03:30:37,720 --> 03:30:41,850
Allie was silent for a moment, then: “What
should I do?”

2332
03:30:41,850 --> 03:30:48,760
“I don’t know, Allie. That’s up to you.
But I would think about it. Think about what

2333
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:52,090
you really want.”

2334
03:30:52,090 --> 03:30:57,680
Allie turned away, her eyes reddening. A moment
later a tear drifted down her cheek.

2335
03:30:57,680 --> 03:31:06,029
“I don’t know. . . ” She trailed off,
and her mother squeezed her hand. Anne looked

2336
03:31:06,029 --> 03:31:11,180
at Noah, who had been sitting with his head
down, listening carefully. As if on cue, he

2337
03:31:11,180 --> 03:31:16,310
returned her gaze, nodded, and left the room.

2338
03:31:16,310 --> 03:31:20,920
When he was gone, Anne whispered, “Do you
love him?”

2339
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:29,050
“Yes, I do,” Allie answered softly, “very
much.” “Do you love Lon?”

2340
03:31:29,050 --> 03:31:36,760
“Yes, I do. I love him, too. Dearly, but
in a different way. He doesn’t make me feel

2341
03:31:36,760 --> 03:31:38,840
the way Noah does.”

2342
03:31:38,840 --> 03:31:46,010
“No one will ever do that,” her mother
said, and she released Allie’s hand.

2343
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:52,359
“I can’t make this decision for you, Allie,
this one’s all yours. I want you to know,

2344
03:31:52,359 --> 03:31:57,681
though, that I love you. And I always will.
I know that doesn’t help but it’s all

2345
03:31:57,681 --> 03:32:00,500
I can do.”

2346
03:32:00,500 --> 03:32:08,140
She reached in her pocketbook and removed
a bundle of letters held together with string,

2347
03:32:08,140 --> 03:32:11,170
the envelopes old and slightly yellowed.

2348
03:32:11,170 --> 03:32:18,850
“These are the letters that Noah wrote you.
I never threw them away, and they haven’t

2349
03:32:18,850 --> 03:32:25,221
been opened. I know I shouldn’t have kept
them from you, and I’m sorry for that. But

2350
03:32:25,221 --> 03:32:31,430
I was just trying to protect you. I didn’t
realize . . .”

2351
03:32:31,430 --> 03:32:36,430
Allie took them and ran her hand over them,
shocked.

2352
03:32:36,430 --> 03:32:42,501
“I should go, Allie. You’ve got some decisions
to make, and you don’t have much time. Do

2353
03:32:42,501 --> 03:32:45,750
you want me to stay in town?”

2354
03:32:45,750 --> 03:32:52,000
Allie shook her head. “No, this is up to
me.” Anne nodded and watched her daughter

2355
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:58,390
for a moment, wondering. Finally she stood,
went around the table, leaned over, and kissed

2356
03:32:58,390 --> 03:33:04,180
her daughter on the cheek. She could see the
question in her daughter’s eyes as Allie

2357
03:33:04,180 --> 03:33:06,640
stood from the table and embraced her.

2358
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:14,620
“What are you going to do?” her mother
asked, pulling back. There was a long pause.

2359
03:33:14,620 --> 03:33:21,899
“I don’t know,” Allie finally answered.
They stood together for another minute, just

2360
03:33:21,899 --> 03:33:23,620
holding each other.

2361
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:29,040
“Thanks for coming,” Allie said. “I
love you.”

2362
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:32,670
“I love you, too.”

2363
03:33:32,670 --> 03:33:36,780
On her way out the door, Allie thought that
she heard her mother whisper, “Follow your

2364
03:33:36,780 --> 03:33:45,430
heart,” but she couldn’t be sure.

2365
03:33:45,430 --> 03:33:48,399
Crossroads

2366
03:33:48,399 --> 03:33:51,569
Noah opened the door for Anne Nelson as she
went out.

2367
03:33:51,569 --> 03:33:59,280
“Good-bye, Noah,” she said quietly. He
nodded without speaking. There wasn’t anything

2368
03:33:59,280 --> 03:34:05,529
else to say; they both knew that. She turned
from him and left, closing the door behind

2369
03:34:05,529 --> 03:34:12,699
her. Noah watched her walk to her car, get
in, and drive away without looking back. She

2370
03:34:12,699 --> 03:34:19,200
was a strong woman, he thought to himself,
and he knew where Allie got it from.

2371
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:23,000
Noah peeked in the living room, saw Allie
sitting with her head down, then went to the

2372
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:29,149
back porch, knowing that she needed to be
alone. He sat quietly in his rocker and watched

2373
03:34:29,149 --> 03:34:33,220
the water drifting by as the minutes passed.

2374
03:34:33,220 --> 03:34:38,890
After what seemed like an eternity he heard
the back door open. He didn’t turn to look

2375
03:34:38,890 --> 03:34:44,100
at her just then—for some reason he couldn’t—and
he listened as she sat in the chair beside

2376
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:45,100
him.

2377
03:34:45,100 --> 03:34:52,130
“I’m sorry,” Allie said. “I had no
idea this would happen.”

2378
03:34:52,130 --> 03:34:57,350
Noah shook his head. “Don’t be sorry.
We both knew it was coming in some form or

2379
03:34:57,350 --> 03:34:58,350
another.”

2380
03:34:58,350 --> 03:35:00,359
“It’s still hard.”

2381
03:35:00,359 --> 03:35:08,030
“I know.” He finally turned to her, reaching
for her hand. “Is there anything I can do

2382
03:35:08,030 --> 03:35:10,390
to make it easier?”

2383
03:35:10,390 --> 03:35:17,199
She shook her head. “No. Not really. I have
to do this alone. Besides, I’m not sure

2384
03:35:17,199 --> 03:35:23,310
what I’m going to say to him yet.” She
looked down and her voice became softer and

2385
03:35:23,310 --> 03:35:29,410
a little more distant, as if she were talking
to herself. “I guess it depends on him and

2386
03:35:29,410 --> 03:35:35,610
how much he knows. If my mother was right,
he may have suspicions, but he doesn’t know

2387
03:35:35,610 --> 03:35:38,779
anything for sure.”

2388
03:35:38,779 --> 03:35:44,980
Noah felt a tightness in his stomach. When
he finally spoke his voice was steady, but

2389
03:35:44,980 --> 03:35:47,880
she could hear the pain in it.

2390
03:35:47,880 --> 03:35:56,120
“You’re not going to tell him about us,
are you?” “I don’t know. I really don’t.

2391
03:35:56,120 --> 03:36:02,310
While I was in the living room, I kept asking
myself what I really wanted in my life.”

2392
03:36:02,310 --> 03:36:08,739
She squeezed his hand. “And do you know
what the answer was? The answer was that I

2393
03:36:08,739 --> 03:36:18,630
wanted two things. First, I want you. I want
us. I love you and I always have.”

2394
03:36:18,630 --> 03:36:21,210
She took a deep breath before going on.

2395
03:36:21,210 --> 03:36:28,069
“But I also want a happy ending without
hurting anyone. And I know that if I stayed,

2396
03:36:28,069 --> 03:36:34,680
people would be hurt. Especially Lon. I wasn’t
lying when I told you that I love him. He

2397
03:36:34,680 --> 03:36:39,470
doesn’t make me feel the same way you do,
but I care for him, and this wouldn’t be

2398
03:36:39,470 --> 03:36:46,989
fair to him. But staying here would also hurt
my family and friends. I would be betraying

2399
03:36:46,989 --> 03:36:48,340
everyone I know.

2400
03:36:48,340 --> 03:36:51,230
...I don’t know if I can do that.”

2401
03:36:51,230 --> 03:36:57,610
“You can’t live your life for other people.
You’ve got to do what’s right for you,

2402
03:36:57,610 --> 03:37:00,010
even if it hurts some people you love.”

2403
03:37:00,010 --> 03:37:06,720
“I know,” she said, “but no matter what
I choose I have to live with it. Forever.

2404
03:37:06,720 --> 03:37:13,470
I have to be able to go forward and not look
back anymore. Can you understand that?”

2405
03:37:13,470 --> 03:37:19,600
He shook his head and tried to keep his voice
steady. “Not really. Not if it means losing

2406
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:25,060
you. I can’t do that again.”

2407
03:37:25,060 --> 03:37:29,380
She didn’t say anything but lowered her
head. Noah went on:

2408
03:37:29,380 --> 03:37:35,470
“Could you really leave me without looking
back?”

2409
03:37:35,470 --> 03:37:43,310
She bit her lip as she answered. Her voice
was beginning to crack. “I don’t know.

2410
03:37:43,310 --> 03:37:44,310
Probably not.”

2411
03:37:44,310 --> 03:37:49,100
“Would that be fair to Lon?”

2412
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:54,210
She didn’t answer right away. Instead she
stood, wiped her face, and walked to the edge

2413
03:37:54,210 --> 03:37:58,689
of the porch where she leaned against the
post. She crossed her arms and watched the

2414
03:37:58,689 --> 03:38:01,450
water before answering quietly.

2415
03:38:01,450 --> 03:38:02,670
“No.”

2416
03:38:02,670 --> 03:38:09,720
“It doesn’t have to be like this, Allie,”
he said. “We’re adults now, we have the

2417
03:38:09,720 --> 03:38:18,350
choice we didn’t have before. We’re meant
to be together. We always have been.”

2418
03:38:18,350 --> 03:38:25,050
He walked to her side and put his hand on
her shoulder. “I don’t want to live the

2419
03:38:25,050 --> 03:38:33,230
rest of my life thinking about you and dreaming
of what might have been. Stay with me, Allie.”

2420
03:38:33,230 --> 03:38:39,239
Tears began to fill her eyes. “I don’t
know if I can,” she finally whispered.

2421
03:38:39,239 --> 03:38:44,770
“You can. Allie . . . I can’t live my
life happily knowing you’re with someone

2422
03:38:44,770 --> 03:38:50,020
else. That would kill a part of me. What we
have is rare. It’s too beautiful to just

2423
03:38:50,020 --> 03:38:53,010
throw it away.”

2424
03:38:53,010 --> 03:38:59,390
She didn’t respond. After a moment he gently
turned her toward him, took her hands, and

2425
03:38:59,390 --> 03:39:05,641
stared at her, willing her to look at him.
Allie finally faced him with moist eyes. After

2426
03:39:05,641 --> 03:39:11,271
a long silence, Noah brushed the tears from
her cheeks with his fingers, a look of tenderness

2427
03:39:11,271 --> 03:39:17,260
on his face. His voice caught as he saw what
her eyes were telling him.

2428
03:39:17,260 --> 03:39:26,330
“You’re not going to stay, are you?”
He smiled weakly. “You want to, but you

2429
03:39:26,330 --> 03:39:27,330
can’t.”

2430
03:39:27,330 --> 03:39:35,300
“Oh, Noah,” she said as the tears began
again, “please try to understand. ...”

2431
03:39:35,300 --> 03:39:37,189
He shook his head to stop her.

2432
03:39:37,189 --> 03:39:44,460
“I know what you’re trying to say—I
can see it in your eyes. But I don’t want

2433
03:39:44,460 --> 03:39:48,800
to understand it, Allie. I don’t want it
to end this way. I don’t want it to end

2434
03:39:48,800 --> 03:39:55,930
at all. But if you leave, we both know we’ll
never see each other again.”

2435
03:39:55,930 --> 03:40:01,160
She leaned into him and began to cry harder
as Noah fought back his own tears.

2436
03:40:01,160 --> 03:40:02,930
He wrapped his arms around her.

2437
03:40:02,930 --> 03:40:07,460
“Allie, I can’t force you to stay with
me. But no matter what happens in my life,

2438
03:40:07,460 --> 03:40:11,960
I’ll never forget these last couple of days
with you. I’ve been dreaming about this

2439
03:40:11,960 --> 03:40:14,510
for years.”

2440
03:40:14,510 --> 03:40:19,210
He kissed her gently, and they embraced as
they had when she first got out of her car

2441
03:40:19,210 --> 03:40:25,080
two days ago. Finally Allie let him go and
wiped her tears.

2442
03:40:25,080 --> 03:40:28,330
“I have to get my things, Noah.”

2443
03:40:28,330 --> 03:40:35,830
He didn’t go inside with her. Instead he
sat down in the rocker, spent. He watched

2444
03:40:35,830 --> 03:40:41,530
her go into the house and listened as the
sound of her movements faded into nothing.

2445
03:40:41,530 --> 03:40:46,220
She emerged from the house minutes later with
everything she’d brought and walked toward

2446
03:40:46,220 --> 03:40:51,960
him with her head down. She handed him the
drawing she had done yesterday morning. As

2447
03:40:51,960 --> 03:40:55,210
he took it, he noticed that she hadn’t stopped
crying.

2448
03:40:55,210 --> 03:40:59,470
“Here, Noah. I made this for you.”

2449
03:40:59,470 --> 03:41:03,410
Noah took the drawing and unrolled it slowly,
careful not to tear it.

2450
03:41:03,410 --> 03:41:10,040
There were dual images, one overlapping the
other. The image in the foreground, which

2451
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:16,570
occupied most of the page, was a picture of
how he looked now, not fourteen years ago.

2452
03:41:16,570 --> 03:41:22,229
Noah noticed that she had penciled in every
detail of his face, including the scar. It

2453
03:41:22,229 --> 03:41:27,010
was almost as if she’d copied it from a
recent photograph.

2454
03:41:27,010 --> 03:41:31,260
The second image was that of the front of
the house. The detail there was also incredible,

2455
03:41:31,260 --> 03:41:34,430
as if she had sketched it while sitting beneath
the oak tree.

2456
03:41:34,430 --> 03:41:42,069
“It’s beautiful, Allie. Thank you.”
He attempted a smile. “I told you that you

2457
03:41:42,069 --> 03:41:49,010
were an artist.” She nodded, her face cast
downward, her lips pressed together. It was

2458
03:41:49,010 --> 03:41:51,489
time for her to go.

2459
03:41:51,489 --> 03:41:56,510
They walked to her car slowly, without speaking.
When they reached it, Noah embraced her again

2460
03:41:56,510 --> 03:42:00,600
until he could feel the tears welling up in
his own eyes. He kissed her lips and both

2461
03:42:00,600 --> 03:42:05,140
cheeks, then with his finger softly brushed
the places he’d kissed.

2462
03:42:05,140 --> 03:42:07,160
“I love you, Allie.”

2463
03:42:07,160 --> 03:42:10,989
“I love you, too.”

2464
03:42:10,989 --> 03:42:16,199
Noah opened her car door, and they kissed
one more time. Then she slid behind the wheel,

2465
03:42:16,199 --> 03:42:21,569
never taking her eyes from him. She put the
packet of letters and the pocketbook next

2466
03:42:21,569 --> 03:42:27,550
to her on the seat and fumbled for the keys,
then turned the ignition. It started easily,

2467
03:42:27,550 --> 03:42:33,060
and the engine began to turn over impatiently.
It was almost time.

2468
03:42:33,060 --> 03:42:38,060
Noah pushed her door closed with both hands,
and Allie rolled down the window. She could

2469
03:42:38,060 --> 03:42:43,840
see the muscles in his arms, the easy smile,
the tanned face. She reached out her hand

2470
03:42:43,840 --> 03:42:49,350
and Noah took it for just a moment, moving
his fingers softly against her skin.

2471
03:42:49,350 --> 03:42:58,280
“Stay with me,” Noah mouthed without sound,
and this for some reason hurt more than Allie

2472
03:42:58,280 --> 03:43:04,250
would have expected. The tears began to fall
hard now, but she couldn’t speak. Finally,

2473
03:43:04,250 --> 03:43:09,279
reluctantly, she looked away and pulled her
hand from his. She put the car in gear and

2474
03:43:09,279 --> 03:43:15,810
eased the pedal down just a bit. If she didn’t
leave now, she never would. Noah backed up

2475
03:43:15,810 --> 03:43:19,860
just a bit as the car started to roll away.

2476
03:43:19,860 --> 03:43:25,779
He fell into an almost trancelike state as
he felt the reality of the situation. He watched

2477
03:43:25,779 --> 03:43:32,360
the car roll slowly forward; he heard the
gravel crunching under the wheels. Slowly

2478
03:43:32,360 --> 03:43:40,199
the car began to turn from him, toward the
road that would take her back to town. Leaving—she

2479
03:43:40,199 --> 03:43:45,700
was leaving!—and Noah felt dizzy at the
sight.

2480
03:43:45,700 --> 03:43:49,930
Edging forward . . . past him now . . .

2481
03:43:49,930 --> 03:43:56,090
She waved one last time without smiling before
she began to accelerate, and he waved back

2482
03:43:56,090 --> 03:44:02,359
weakly. “Don’t go!” he wanted to shout
as the car moved farther away. But he didn’t

2483
03:44:02,359 --> 03:44:08,210
say anything, and a minute later the car was
gone and the only remaining signs of her were

2484
03:44:08,210 --> 03:44:12,760
the tracks that her car had left behind.

2485
03:44:12,760 --> 03:44:20,720
He stood there without moving for a long time.
As quickly as she had come, she was gone.

2486
03:44:20,720 --> 03:44:27,470
Forever this time. Forever.

2487
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:33,840
He closed his eyes then and watched her leave
once more, her car moving steadily away from

2488
03:44:33,840 --> 03:44:37,050
him, taking his heart with her.

2489
03:44:37,050 --> 03:44:52,930
But, like her mother, he realized sadly, she
never looked back.

2490
03:44:52,930 --> 03:44:59,350
A Letter fromYesterday
Driving with tears in her eyes was difficult,

2491
03:44:59,350 --> 03:45:04,640
but she went on anyway, hoping that instinct
would take her back to the inn. She kept the

2492
03:45:04,640 --> 03:45:09,930
window rolled down, thinking the fresh air
might help clear her mind, but it didn’t

2493
03:45:09,930 --> 03:45:12,140
seem to help. Nothing would help.

2494
03:45:12,140 --> 03:45:17,470
She was tired, and she wondered if she would
have the energy she needed to talk to Lon.

2495
03:45:17,470 --> 03:45:22,810
And what was she going to say? She still had
no idea but hoped that something would come

2496
03:45:22,810 --> 03:45:24,439
to her when the time came.

2497
03:45:24,439 --> 03:45:26,760
It would have to.

2498
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:30,949
By the time she reached the drawbridge that
led to Front Street, she had herself a little

2499
03:45:30,949 --> 03:45:36,310
more under control. Not completely, but well
enough, she thought, to talk to Lon. At least

2500
03:45:36,310 --> 03:45:38,989
she hoped so.

2501
03:45:38,989 --> 03:45:43,510
Traffic was light, and she had time to watch
strangers going about their business as she

2502
03:45:43,510 --> 03:45:48,370
drove through New Bern. At a gas station,
a mechanic was looking under the hood of a

2503
03:45:48,370 --> 03:45:54,010
new automobile while a man, presumably its
owner, stood beside him. Two women were pushing

2504
03:45:54,010 --> 03:46:00,560
baby carriages just outside Hoffman-Lane,
chatting between themselves while they window-shopped.

2505
03:46:00,560 --> 03:46:07,040
In front of Hearns Jewelers, a well-dressed
man walked briskly, carrying a briefcase.

2506
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:11,949
She made another turn and saw a young man
unloading groceries from a truck that blocked

2507
03:46:11,949 --> 03:46:17,470
part of the street. Something about the way
he held himself, or the way he moved, reminded

2508
03:46:17,470 --> 03:46:21,689
her of Noah harvesting crabs at the end of
the dock.

2509
03:46:21,689 --> 03:46:26,090
She saw the inn just up the street while she
was stopped at a red light. She took a deep

2510
03:46:26,090 --> 03:46:30,920
breath when the light turned green and drove
slowly until she reached the parking lot that

2511
03:46:30,920 --> 03:46:37,001
the inn shared with a couple of other businesses.
She turned in and saw Lon’s car sitting

2512
03:46:37,001 --> 03:46:42,290
in the first spot. Although the one next to
it was open, she passed it and picked a spot

2513
03:46:42,290 --> 03:46:45,470
a little farther from the entrance.

2514
03:46:45,470 --> 03:46:50,230
She turned the key, and the engine stopped
promptly. Next she reached into the glove

2515
03:46:50,230 --> 03:46:56,470
compartment for a mirror and brush, finding
both sitting on top of a map of North Carolina.

2516
03:46:56,470 --> 03:47:01,720
Looking at herself, she saw her eyes were
still red and puffy. Like yesterday after

2517
03:47:01,720 --> 03:47:06,391
the rain, as she examined her reflection she
was sorry she didn’t have any makeup, though

2518
03:47:06,391 --> 03:47:13,210
she doubted it would help much now. She tried
pulling her hair back on one side, tried both

2519
03:47:13,210 --> 03:47:17,290
sides, then finally gave up.

2520
03:47:17,290 --> 03:47:21,060
She reached for her pocketbook, opened it,
and once again looked at the article that

2521
03:47:21,060 --> 03:47:27,340
had brought her here. So much had happened
since then; it was hard to believe it had

2522
03:47:27,340 --> 03:47:32,820
been only three weeks. It felt impossible
to her that she had arrived only the day before

2523
03:47:32,820 --> 03:47:38,870
yesterday. It seemed like a lifetime since
her dinner with Noah.

2524
03:47:38,870 --> 03:47:43,790
Starlings chirped in the trees around her.
The clouds had begun to break up now, and

2525
03:47:43,790 --> 03:47:49,449
Allie could see blue in between patches of
white. The sun was still shaded, but she knew

2526
03:47:49,449 --> 03:47:54,960
it would only be a matter of time. It was
going to be a beautiful day.

2527
03:47:54,960 --> 03:47:59,149
It was the kind of day she would have liked
to spend with Noah, and as she was thinking

2528
03:47:59,149 --> 03:48:03,830
about him, she remembered the letters her
mother had given her and reached for them.

2529
03:48:03,830 --> 03:48:08,470
She untied the packet and found the first
letter he had written her. She began to open

2530
03:48:08,470 --> 03:48:15,180
it, then stopped because she could imagine
what was in it. Something simple, no doubt—things

2531
03:48:15,180 --> 03:48:22,210
he’d done, memories of the summer, perhaps
some questions. After all, he probably expected

2532
03:48:22,210 --> 03:48:27,890
an answer from her. Instead she reached for
the last letter he’d written, the one on

2533
03:48:27,890 --> 03:48:34,050
the bottom of the stack. The good-bye letter.
This one interested her far more than the

2534
03:48:34,050 --> 03:48:39,690
others. How had he said it? How would she
have said it?

2535
03:48:39,690 --> 03:48:46,989
The envelope was thin. One, maybe two pages.
Whatever he had written wasn’t too long.

2536
03:48:46,989 --> 03:48:51,199
First, she turned it over and checked the
back. No name, just a street address in New

2537
03:48:51,199 --> 03:48:56,939
Jersey. She held her breath as she used her
fingernail to pry it open.

2538
03:48:56,939 --> 03:49:06,330
Unfolding it, she saw it was dated March 1935.
Two and a half years without a reply.

2539
03:49:06,330 --> 03:49:12,970
She imagined him sitting at an old desk, crafting
the letter, somehow knowing this was the end,

2540
03:49:12,970 --> 03:49:20,530
and she saw what she thought were tearstains
on the paper. Probably just her imagination.

2541
03:49:20,530 --> 03:49:24,600
She straightened the page and began to read
in the soft white sunlight that shone through

2542
03:49:24,600 --> 03:49:27,120
the window.

2543
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:31,420
My dearest Allie,
I don’t know what to say anymore except

2544
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:36,961
that I couldn’t sleep last night because
I knew that it is over between us. It is a

2545
03:49:36,961 --> 03:49:42,720
different feeling for me, one that I never
expected, but looking back, I suppose it couldn’t

2546
03:49:42,720 --> 03:49:48,319
have ended another way.
You and I were different. We came from different

2547
03:49:48,319 --> 03:49:53,970
worlds, and yet you were the one who taught
me the value of love. You showed me what it

2548
03:49:53,970 --> 03:50:00,020
was like to care for another, and I am a better
man because of it. I don’t want you to ever

2549
03:50:00,020 --> 03:50:04,109
forget that.
I am not bitter because of what has happened.

2550
03:50:04,109 --> 03:50:10,810
On the contrary. I am secure in knowing that
what we had was real, and I am happy we were

2551
03:50:10,810 --> 03:50:16,609
able to come together for even a short period
of time. And if, in some distant place in

2552
03:50:16,609 --> 03:50:20,900
the future, we see each other in our new lives,
I will

2553
03:50:20,900 --> 03:50:27,199
smile at you with joy, and remember how we
spent a summer beneath the trees, learning

2554
03:50:27,199 --> 03:50:34,740
from each other and growing in love. And maybe,
for a brief moment, you’ll feel it too,

2555
03:50:34,740 --> 03:50:41,600
and you’ll smile back, and savor the memories
we will always share together.

2556
03:50:41,600 --> 03:50:47,229
I love you, Allie.
Noah

2557
03:50:47,229 --> 03:50:52,880
She read the letter again, more slowly this
time, then read it a third time before she

2558
03:50:52,880 --> 03:50:59,380
put it back into the envelope. Once more,
she imagined him writing it, and for a moment

2559
03:50:59,380 --> 03:51:04,540
she debated reading another, but she knew
she couldn’t delay any longer. Lon was waiting

2560
03:51:04,540 --> 03:51:06,979
for her.

2561
03:51:06,979 --> 03:51:15,430
Her legs felt weak as she stepped out of the
car. She paused and took a deep breath, and

2562
03:51:15,430 --> 03:51:22,649
as she started across the parking lot, she
realized she still wasn’t sure what she

2563
03:51:22,649 --> 03:51:25,250
was going to say to him.

2564
03:51:25,250 --> 03:51:34,569
And the answer didn’t finally come until
she reached the door and opened it and saw

2565
03:51:34,569 --> 03:51:42,170
Lon standing in the lobby.

2566
03:51:42,170 --> 03:51:47,239
Winter for Two

2567
03:51:47,239 --> 03:51:57,301
The story ends there, so I close the notebook,
remove my glasses, and wipe my eyes. They

2568
03:51:57,301 --> 03:52:05,850
are tired and bloodshot, but they have not
failed me so far. They will soon, I am sure.

2569
03:52:05,850 --> 03:52:14,271
Neither they nor I can go on forever. I look
to her now that I have finished, but she does

2570
03:52:14,271 --> 03:52:20,720
not look back. Instead she is staring out
the window at the courtyard, where friends

2571
03:52:20,720 --> 03:52:23,470
and family meet.

2572
03:52:23,470 --> 03:52:31,070
My eyes follow hers, and we watch it together.
In all these years the daily pattern has not

2573
03:52:31,070 --> 03:52:38,540
changed. Every morning, an hour after breakfast,
they begin to arrive. Young adults, alone

2574
03:52:38,540 --> 03:52:46,120
or with family, come to visit those who live
here. They bring photographs and gifts and

2575
03:52:46,120 --> 03:52:52,199
either sit on the benches or stroll along
the tree-lined paths designed to give a sense

2576
03:52:52,199 --> 03:52:59,320
of nature. Some will stay for the day, but
most leave after a few hours, and when they

2577
03:52:59,320 --> 03:53:08,200
do, I always feel sadness for those they’ve
left behind. I wonder sometimes what my friends

2578
03:53:08,200 --> 03:53:15,659
think as they see their loved ones driving
off, but I know it’s not my business. And

2579
03:53:15,659 --> 03:53:23,310
I do not ever ask them because I’ve learned
that we’re all entitled to have our secrets.

2580
03:53:23,310 --> 03:53:27,340
But soon, I will tell you some of mine.

2581
03:53:27,340 --> 03:53:34,040
I place the notebook and magnifier on the
table beside me, feeling the ache in my bones

2582
03:53:34,040 --> 03:53:42,270
as I do so, and I realize once again how cold
my body is. Even reading in the morning sun

2583
03:53:42,270 --> 03:53:48,560
does nothing to help it. This does not surprise
me anymore, though, for my body makes its

2584
03:53:48,560 --> 03:53:50,659
own rules these days.

2585
03:53:50,659 --> 03:53:58,120
I’m not completely unfortunate, however.
The people who work here know me and my faults

2586
03:53:58,120 --> 03:54:05,100
and do their best to make me more comfortable.
They have left me hot tea on the end table,

2587
03:54:05,100 --> 03:54:10,800
and I reach for it with both hands. It is
an effort to pour a cup, but I do so because

2588
03:54:10,800 --> 03:54:17,149
the tea is needed to warm me and I think the
exertion will keep me from completely rusting

2589
03:54:17,149 --> 03:54:26,570
away. But I am rusted now, no doubt about
it. Rusted as a junked car twenty years in

2590
03:54:26,570 --> 03:54:29,140
the Everglades.

2591
03:54:29,140 --> 03:54:36,319
I have read to her this morning, as I do every
morning, because it is something I must do.

2592
03:54:36,319 --> 03:54:44,060
Not for duty—although I suppose a case could
be made for this—but for another, more romantic,

2593
03:54:44,060 --> 03:54:50,010
reason. I wish I could explain it more fully
right now, but it’s still early, and talking

2594
03:54:50,010 --> 03:54:56,850
about romance isn’t really possible before
lunch anymore, at least not for me. Besides,

2595
03:54:56,850 --> 03:55:02,480
I have no idea how it’s going to turn out,
and to be honest, I’d rather not get my

2596
03:55:02,480 --> 03:55:05,380
hopes up.

2597
03:55:05,380 --> 03:55:12,189
We spend each and every day together now,
but our nights are spent alone. The doctors

2598
03:55:12,189 --> 03:55:17,859
tell me that I’m not allowed to see her
after dark. I understand the reasons completely,

2599
03:55:17,859 --> 03:55:23,779
and though I agree with them, I sometimes
break the rules. Late at night when my mood

2600
03:55:23,779 --> 03:55:31,561
is right, I will sneak from my room and go
to hers and watch her while she sleeps. Of

2601
03:55:31,561 --> 03:55:38,080
this she knows nothing. I’ll come in and
see her breathe and know that had it not been

2602
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:46,350
for her, I would never have married. And when
I look at her face, a face I know better than

2603
03:55:46,350 --> 03:55:55,460
my own, I know that I have meant as much or
more to her. And that means more to me than

2604
03:55:55,460 --> 03:55:58,220
I could ever hope to explain.

2605
03:55:58,220 --> 03:56:03,850
Sometimes, when I am standing there, I think
about how lucky I am to have been married

2606
03:56:03,850 --> 03:56:11,840
to her for almost forty-nine years. Next month
it will be that long. She heard me snore for

2607
03:56:11,840 --> 03:56:19,120
the first forty-five, but since then we have
slept in separate rooms. I do not sleep well

2608
03:56:19,120 --> 03:56:25,860
without her. I toss and turn and yearn for
her warmth and lie there most of the night,

2609
03:56:25,860 --> 03:56:31,010
eyes open wide, watching the shadows dance
across the ceilings like tumbleweeds rolling

2610
03:56:31,010 --> 03:56:39,000
across the desert. I sleep two hours if I
am lucky, and still I wake before dawn. This

2611
03:56:39,000 --> 03:56:40,660
makes no sense to me.

2612
03:56:40,660 --> 03:56:50,080
Soon, this will all be over. I know this.
She does not. The entries in my diary have

2613
03:56:50,080 --> 03:56:56,920
become shorter and take little time to write.
I keep them simple now, since most of my days

2614
03:56:56,920 --> 03:57:03,930
are the same. But tonight I think I will copy
a poem that one of the nurses found for me

2615
03:57:03,930 --> 03:57:07,460
and thought I would enjoy. It goes like this:

2616
03:57:07,460 --> 03:57:15,560
I ne’er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet, Her face

2617
03:57:15,560 --> 03:57:26,290
it bloomed like a sweet flower
And stole my heart away complete.

2618
03:57:26,290 --> 03:57:32,621
Because our evenings are our own, I have been
asked to visit the others. Usually I do, for

2619
03:57:32,621 --> 03:57:40,700
I am the reader and I am needed, or so I am
told. I walk the halls and choose where to

2620
03:57:40,700 --> 03:57:46,960
go because I am too old to devote myself to
a schedule, but deep down I always know who

2621
03:57:46,960 --> 03:57:53,140
needs me. They are my friends, and when I
push open their doors, I see rooms that look

2622
03:57:53,140 --> 03:58:00,061
like mine, always semidarkened, illuminated
only by the lights of Wheel of Fortune and

2623
03:58:00,061 --> 03:58:06,109
Vanna’s teeth. The furniture is the same
for everyone, and the TVs blare because no

2624
03:58:06,109 --> 03:58:09,630
one can hear well anymore.

2625
03:58:09,630 --> 03:58:14,880
Men or women, they smile at me when I enter
and speak in whispers as they turn off their

2626
03:58:14,880 --> 03:58:21,779
sets. “I’m so glad you’ve come,” they
say, and then they ask about my wife. Sometimes

2627
03:58:21,779 --> 03:58:27,210
I tell them. I might tell them of her sweetness
and her charm and describe how she taught

2628
03:58:27,210 --> 03:58:33,561
me to see the world for the beautiful place
it is. Or I tell them of our early years together

2629
03:58:33,561 --> 03:58:39,550
and explain how we had all we needed when
we held each other under starry southern skies.

2630
03:58:39,550 --> 03:58:47,130
On special occasions I whisper of our adventures
together, of art shows in New York and Paris

2631
03:58:47,130 --> 03:58:54,439
or the rave reviews from critics writing in
languages I do not understand. Mostly, though,

2632
03:58:54,439 --> 03:59:01,470
I smile and I tell them that she is the same,
and they turn from me, for I know they do

2633
03:59:01,470 --> 03:59:07,880
not want me to see their faces. It reminds
them of their own mortality. So I sit with

2634
03:59:07,880 --> 03:59:11,159
them and read to lessen their fears.

2635
03:59:11,159 --> 03:59:20,310
Be composed—be at ease with me . . .
Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude

2636
03:59:20,310 --> 03:59:26,850
you, Not till the waters refuse to glisten
for you and the leaves to rustle for you,

2637
03:59:26,850 --> 03:59:32,659
do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for
you.

2638
03:59:32,659 --> 03:59:37,470
And I read, to let them know who I am.

2639
03:59:37,470 --> 03:59:43,840
I wander all night in my vision, . . .
Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes

2640
03:59:43,840 --> 03:59:52,390
of sleepers,
Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted,

2641
03:59:52,390 --> 04:00:01,739
contradictory,
Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.

2642
04:00:01,739 --> 04:00:07,420
If she could, my wife would accompany me on
my evening excursions, for one of her many

2643
04:00:07,420 --> 04:00:15,750
loves was poetry. Thomas, Whitman, Eliot,
Shakespeare, and King David of the Psalms.

2644
04:00:15,750 --> 04:00:23,540
Lovers of words, makers of language. Looking
back, I am surprised by my passion for it,

2645
04:00:23,540 --> 04:00:31,330
and sometimes I even regret it now. Poetry
brings great beauty to life, but also great

2646
04:00:31,330 --> 04:00:39,640
sadness, and I’m not sure it’s a fair
exchange for someone my age. A man should

2647
04:00:39,640 --> 04:00:48,560
enjoy other things if he can; he should spend
his final days in the sun. Mine will be spent

2648
04:00:48,560 --> 04:00:50,729
by a reading lamp.

2649
04:00:50,729 --> 04:00:59,140
I shuffle toward her and sit in the chair
beside her bed. My back aches when I sit.

2650
04:00:59,140 --> 04:01:06,040
I must get a new cushion for this chair, I
remind myself for the hundredth time. I reach

2651
04:01:06,040 --> 04:01:14,800
for her hand and take it, bony and fragile.
It feels nice. She responds with a twitch,

2652
04:01:14,800 --> 04:01:21,680
and gradually her thumb begins to softly rub
my finger. I do not speak until she does;

2653
04:01:21,680 --> 04:01:27,949
this I have learned. Most days I sit in silence
until the sun goes down, and on days like

2654
04:01:27,949 --> 04:01:31,870
those I know nothing about her.

2655
04:01:31,870 --> 04:01:39,630
Minutes pass before she finally turns to me.
She is crying. I smile and release her hand,

2656
04:01:39,630 --> 04:01:46,100
then reach in my pocket. I take out a handkerchief
and wipe at her tears. She looks at me as

2657
04:01:46,100 --> 04:01:49,870
I do so, and I wonder what she is thinking.

2658
04:01:49,870 --> 04:01:53,979
“That was a beautiful story.”

2659
04:01:53,979 --> 04:02:01,300
A light rain begins to fall. Little drops
tap gently on the window. I take her hand

2660
04:02:01,300 --> 04:02:08,600
again. It is going to be a good day, a very
good day. A magical day. I smile, I can’t

2661
04:02:08,600 --> 04:02:09,880
help it.

2662
04:02:09,880 --> 04:02:13,250
“Yes, it is,” I tell her.

2663
04:02:13,250 --> 04:02:21,220
“Did you write it?” she asks. Her voice
is like a whisper, a light wind flowing through

2664
04:02:21,220 --> 04:02:22,740
the leaves.

2665
04:02:22,740 --> 04:02:26,359
“Yes,” I answer.

2666
04:02:26,359 --> 04:02:32,350
She turns toward the nightstand. Her medicine
is in a little cup. Mine too. Little pills,

2667
04:02:32,350 --> 04:02:37,810
colors like a rainbow so we won’t forget
to take them. They bring mine here now, to

2668
04:02:37,810 --> 04:02:40,380
her room, even though they’re not supposed
to.

2669
04:02:40,380 --> 04:02:45,859
“I’ve heard it before, haven’t I?”

2670
04:02:45,859 --> 04:02:51,760
“Yes,” I say again, just as I do every
time on days like these. I have learned to

2671
04:02:51,760 --> 04:02:54,130
be patient.

2672
04:02:54,130 --> 04:02:59,840
She studies my face. Her eyes are as green
as ocean waves.

2673
04:02:59,840 --> 04:03:05,210
“It makes me feel less afraid,” she says.

2674
04:03:05,210 --> 04:03:11,640
“I know.” I nod, rocking my head softly.

2675
04:03:11,640 --> 04:03:17,850
She turns away, and I wait some more. She
releases my hand and reaches for her water

2676
04:03:17,850 --> 04:03:22,720
glass. It is on her nightstand, next to the
medicine. She takes a sip.

2677
04:03:22,720 --> 04:03:31,220
“Is it a true story?” She sits up a little
in her bed and takes another drink. Her body

2678
04:03:31,220 --> 04:03:37,200
is still strong. “I mean, did you know these
people?”

2679
04:03:37,200 --> 04:03:45,100
“Yes,” I say again. I could say more,
but usually I don’t. She is still beautiful.

2680
04:03:45,100 --> 04:03:46,729
She asks the obvious:

2681
04:03:46,729 --> 04:03:52,310
“Well, which one did she finally marry?”

2682
04:03:52,310 --> 04:04:00,000
I answer: “The one who was right for her.”
“Which one was that?”

2683
04:04:00,000 --> 04:04:11,609
I smile. “You’ll know,” I say quietly,
“by the end of the day. You’ll know.”

2684
04:04:11,609 --> 04:04:15,841
She does not know what to think about this
but does not question me further. Instead

2685
04:04:15,841 --> 04:04:21,260
she begins to fidget. She is thinking of a
way to ask me another question, though she

2686
04:04:21,260 --> 04:04:28,340
isn’t sure how to do it. Instead she chooses
to put it off for a moment and reaches for

2687
04:04:28,340 --> 04:04:30,370
one of the little paper cups.

2688
04:04:30,370 --> 04:04:32,979
“Is this mine?”

2689
04:04:32,979 --> 04:04:40,830
“No, this one is,” and I reach over and
push her medicine toward her. I cannot grab

2690
04:04:40,830 --> 04:04:48,010
it with my fingers. She takes it and looks
at the pills. I can tell by the way she is

2691
04:04:48,010 --> 04:04:55,229
looking at them that she has no idea what
they are for. I use both hands to pick up

2692
04:04:55,229 --> 04:05:02,710
my cup and dump the pills into my mouth. She
does the same. There is no fight today. That

2693
04:05:02,710 --> 04:05:10,430
makes it easy. I raise my cup in a mock toast
and wash the gritty flavor from my mouth with

2694
04:05:10,430 --> 04:05:19,660
my tea. It is getting colder. She swallows
on faith and washes them down with more water.

2695
04:05:19,660 --> 04:05:25,850
A bird starts to sing outside the window,
and we both turn our heads. We sit quietly

2696
04:05:25,850 --> 04:05:32,449
for a while, enjoying something beautiful
together. Then it is lost, and she sighs.

2697
04:05:32,449 --> 04:05:41,310
“I have to ask you something else,” she
says. “Whatever it is, I’ll try to answer.”

2698
04:05:41,310 --> 04:05:44,560
“It’s hard, though.”

2699
04:05:44,560 --> 04:05:50,090
She does not look at me, and I cannot see
her eyes. This is how she hides her thoughts.

2700
04:05:50,090 --> 04:05:52,540
Some things never change.

2701
04:05:52,540 --> 04:06:01,500
“Take your time,” I say. I know what she
will ask. Finally she turns to me and looks

2702
04:06:01,500 --> 04:06:09,350
into my eyes. She offers a gentle smile, the
kind you share with a child, not a lover.

2703
04:06:09,350 --> 04:06:16,880
“I don’t want to hurt your feelings because
you’ve been so nice to me, but . . .”

2704
04:06:16,880 --> 04:06:27,790
I wait. Her words will hurt me. They will
tear a piece from my heart and leave a scar.

2705
04:06:27,790 --> 04:06:36,949
“Who are you?”

2706
04:06:36,949 --> 04:06:42,840
We have lived at Creekside Extended Care Facility
for three years now. It was her decision to

2707
04:06:42,840 --> 04:06:47,779
come here, partly because it was near our
home, but also because she thought it would

2708
04:06:47,779 --> 04:06:54,330
be easier for me. We boarded up our home because
neither of us could bear to sell it, signed

2709
04:06:54,330 --> 04:07:00,460
some papers, and just like that we received
a place to live and die in exchange for some

2710
04:07:00,460 --> 04:07:04,060
of the freedom for which we had worked a lifetime.

2711
04:07:04,060 --> 04:07:09,729
She was right to do this, of course. There
is no way I could have made it alone, for

2712
04:07:09,729 --> 04:07:16,630
sickness has come to us, both of us. We are
in the final minutes in the day of our lives,

2713
04:07:16,630 --> 04:07:21,949
and the clock is ticking. Loudly. I wonder
if I am the only one who can hear it.

2714
04:07:21,949 --> 04:07:27,930
A throbbing pain courses through my fingers,
and it reminds me that we have not held hands

2715
04:07:27,930 --> 04:07:35,310
with fingers interlocked since we moved here.
I am sad about this, but it is my fault, not

2716
04:07:35,310 --> 04:07:45,950
hers. It is arthritis in the worst form, rheumatoid
and advanced. My hands are misshapen and grotesque

2717
04:07:45,950 --> 04:07:53,100
now, and they throb during most of my waking
hours. I look at them and want them gone,

2718
04:07:53,100 --> 04:07:58,080
amputated, but then I would not be able to
do the little things I must do. So I use my

2719
04:07:58,080 --> 04:08:04,600
claws, as I call them sometimes, and every
day I take her hands despite the pain, and

2720
04:08:04,600 --> 04:08:11,060
I do my best to hold them because that is
what she wants me to do.

2721
04:08:11,060 --> 04:08:17,060
Although the Bible says man can live to be
120, I don’t want to, and I don’t think

2722
04:08:17,060 --> 04:08:25,290
my body would make it even if I did. It is
falling apart, dying one piece at a time,

2723
04:08:25,290 --> 04:08:31,630
steady erosion on the inside and at the joints.
My hands are useless, my kidneys are beginning

2724
04:08:31,630 --> 04:08:38,750
to fail, and my heart rate is decreasing every
month. Worse, I have cancer again, this time

2725
04:08:38,750 --> 04:08:46,080
of the prostate. This is my third bout with
the unseen enemy, and it will take me eventually,

2726
04:08:46,080 --> 04:08:53,000
though not till I say it is time. The doctors
are worried about me, but I am not. I have

2727
04:08:53,000 --> 04:08:58,250
no time for worry in this twilight of my life.

2728
04:08:58,250 --> 04:09:02,739
Of our five children, four are still living,
and though it is hard for them to visit, they

2729
04:09:02,739 --> 04:09:08,000
come often, and for this I am thankful. But
even when they aren’t here, they come alive

2730
04:09:08,000 --> 04:09:13,670
in my mind every day, each of them, and they
bring to mind the smiles and tears that come

2731
04:09:13,670 --> 04:09:20,510
with raising a family. A dozen pictures line
the walls of my room. They are my heritage,

2732
04:09:20,510 --> 04:09:27,060
my contribution to the world. I am very proud.
Sometimes I wonder what my wife thinks of

2733
04:09:27,060 --> 04:09:33,630
them as she dreams, or if she thinks of them
at all, or if she even dreams. There is so

2734
04:09:33,630 --> 04:09:38,210
much about her I don’t understand anymore.

2735
04:09:38,210 --> 04:09:43,989
I wonder what my daddy would think of my life
and what he would do if he were me. I have

2736
04:09:43,989 --> 04:09:49,909
not seen him for fifty years and he is now
but a shadow in my thoughts. I cannot picture

2737
04:09:49,909 --> 04:09:57,220
him clearly anymore; his face is darkened
as if a light shines from behind him. I am

2738
04:09:57,220 --> 04:10:02,790
not sure if this is due to a failing memory
or simply the passage of time. I have only

2739
04:10:02,790 --> 04:10:09,100
one picture of him, and this too has faded.
In another ten years it will be gone and so

2740
04:10:09,100 --> 04:10:16,330
will I, and his memory will be erased like
a message in the sand. If not for my diaries,

2741
04:10:16,330 --> 04:10:22,189
I would swear I had lived only half as long
as I have. Long periods of my life seem to

2742
04:10:22,189 --> 04:10:29,319
have vanished. And even now I read the passages
and wonder who I was when I wrote them, for

2743
04:10:29,319 --> 04:10:36,609
I cannot remember the events of my life. There
are times I sit and wonder where it all has

2744
04:10:36,609 --> 04:10:38,670
gone.

2745
04:10:38,670 --> 04:10:49,550
“My name,” I say, “is Duke.” I have
always been a John Wayne fan.

2746
04:10:49,550 --> 04:10:58,369
“Duke,” she whispers to herself, “Duke.”
She thinks for a moment, her forehead wrinkled,

2747
04:10:58,369 --> 04:11:00,490
her eyes serious.

2748
04:11:00,490 --> 04:11:08,870
“Yes,” I say, “I’m here for you.”
And always will be, I think to myself.

2749
04:11:08,870 --> 04:11:15,760
She flushes with my answer. Her eyes become
wet and red, and tears begin to fall. My heart

2750
04:11:15,760 --> 04:11:22,279
aches for her, and I wish for the thousandth
time that there was something I could do.

2751
04:11:22,279 --> 04:11:23,350
She says:

2752
04:11:23,350 --> 04:11:31,200
“I’m sorry. I don’t understand anything
that’s happening to me right now. Even you.

2753
04:11:31,200 --> 04:11:36,869
When I listen to you talk I feel like I should
know you, but I don’t. I don’t even know

2754
04:11:36,869 --> 04:11:39,930
my name.”

2755
04:11:39,930 --> 04:11:49,529
She wipes at her tears and says, “Help me,
Duke, help me remember who I am. Or at least,

2756
04:11:49,529 --> 04:11:55,710
who I was. I feel so lost.”

2757
04:11:55,710 --> 04:12:04,310
I answer from my heart, but I lie to her about
her name. As I have about my own. There is

2758
04:12:04,310 --> 04:12:06,140
a reason for this.

2759
04:12:06,140 --> 04:12:15,540
“You are Hannah, a lover of life, a strength
to those who shared in your friendships. You

2760
04:12:15,540 --> 04:12:23,350
are a dream, a creator of happiness, an artist
who has touched a thousand souls. You’ve

2761
04:12:23,350 --> 04:12:29,090
led a full life and wanted for nothing because
your needs are spiritual and you have only

2762
04:12:29,090 --> 04:12:35,810
to look inside you. You are kind and loyal,
and you are able to see beauty where others

2763
04:12:35,810 --> 04:12:46,390
do not. You are a teacher of wonderful lessons,
a dreamer of better things.”

2764
04:12:46,390 --> 04:12:54,819
I stop for a moment and catch my breath. Then,
“Hannah, there is no reason to feel lost,

2765
04:12:54,819 --> 04:12:56,430
for:

2766
04:12:56,430 --> 04:13:06,060
Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,
No birth, identity, form—no object of the

2767
04:13:06,060 --> 04:13:13,340
world,
Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing;

2768
04:13:13,340 --> 04:13:18,050
. . . The body, sluggish, aged, cold—the
embers left from earlier fires,

2769
04:13:18,050 --> 04:13:28,560
. . . shall duly flame again;”
She thinks about what I have said for a moment.

2770
04:13:28,560 --> 04:13:33,831
In the silence, I look toward the window and
notice that the rain has stopped now. Sunlight

2771
04:13:33,831 --> 04:13:37,479
is beginning to filter into her room. She
asks:

2772
04:13:37,479 --> 04:13:40,689
“Did you write that?”

2773
04:13:40,689 --> 04:13:44,450
“No, that was Walt Whitman.” “Who?”

2774
04:13:44,450 --> 04:13:51,040
“A lover of words, a shaper of thoughts.”

2775
04:13:51,040 --> 04:13:58,680
She does not respond directly. Instead she
stares at me for a long while, until our breathing

2776
04:13:58,680 --> 04:14:17,150
coincides. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. Deep
breaths. I wonder if she knows I think she’s

2777
04:14:17,150 --> 04:14:18,300
beautiful.

2778
04:14:18,300 --> 04:14:24,420
“Would you stay with me a while?” she
finally asks.

2779
04:14:24,420 --> 04:14:33,130
I smile and nod. She smiles back. She reaches
for my hand, takes it gently, and pulls it

2780
04:14:33,130 --> 04:14:42,649
to her waist. She stares at the hardened knots
that deform my fingers and caresses them gently.

2781
04:14:42,649 --> 04:14:46,460
Her hands are still those of an angel.

2782
04:14:46,460 --> 04:14:54,659
“Come,” I say as I stand with great effort,
“let’s go for a walk. The air is crisp

2783
04:14:54,659 --> 04:15:01,751
and the goslings are waiting. It’s beautiful
today.” I am staring at her as I say these

2784
04:15:01,751 --> 04:15:04,350
last few words.

2785
04:15:04,350 --> 04:15:12,890
She blushes. It makes me feel young again.

2786
04:15:12,890 --> 04:15:19,319
She was famous, of course. One of the best
southern painters of the twentieth century,

2787
04:15:19,319 --> 04:15:26,649
some said, and I was, and am, proud of her.
Unlike me, who struggled to write even the

2788
04:15:26,649 --> 04:15:34,720
simplest of verses, my wife could create beauty
as easily as the Lord created the earth. Her

2789
04:15:34,720 --> 04:15:40,810
paintings are in museums around the world,
but I have kept only two for myself. The first

2790
04:15:40,810 --> 04:15:47,279
one she ever gave me and the last one. They
hang in my room, and late at night I sit and

2791
04:15:47,279 --> 04:15:54,070
stare and sometimes cry when I look at them.
I don’t know why.

2792
04:15:54,070 --> 04:16:00,909
And so the years passed. We led our lives,
working, painting, raising children, loving

2793
04:16:00,909 --> 04:16:09,520
each other. I see photos of Christmases, family
trips, of graduations and of weddings. I see

2794
04:16:09,520 --> 04:16:15,130
grandchildren and happy faces. I see photos
of us, our hair growing whiter, the lines

2795
04:16:15,130 --> 04:16:23,000
in our faces deeper. A lifetime that seems
so typical, yet uncommon.

2796
04:16:23,000 --> 04:16:30,140
We could not foresee the future, but then
who can? I do not live now as I expected to.

2797
04:16:30,140 --> 04:16:37,220
And what did I expect? Retirement. Visits
with the grandchildren, perhaps more travel.

2798
04:16:37,220 --> 04:16:43,391
She always loved to travel. I thought that
perhaps I would start a hobby, what I did

2799
04:16:43,391 --> 04:16:50,760
not know, but possibly shipbuilding. In bottles.
Small, detailed, impossible to consider now

2800
04:16:50,760 --> 04:16:55,850
with my hands. But I am not bitter.

2801
04:16:55,850 --> 04:17:00,930
Our lives can’t be measured by our final
years, of this I am sure, and I guess I should

2802
04:17:00,930 --> 04:17:07,270
have known what lay ahead in our lives. Looking
back, I suppose it seems obvious, but at first

2803
04:17:07,270 --> 04:17:13,080
I thought her confusion understandable and
not unique. She would forget where she placed

2804
04:17:13,080 --> 04:17:19,350
her keys, but who has not done that? She would
forget a neighbor’s name, but not someone

2805
04:17:19,350 --> 04:17:25,790
we knew well or with whom we socialized. Sometimes
she would write the wrong year when she made

2806
04:17:25,790 --> 04:17:31,479
out her checks, but again I dismissed it as
simple mistakes that one makes when thinking

2807
04:17:31,479 --> 04:17:34,710
of other things.

2808
04:17:34,710 --> 04:17:41,310
It was not until the more obvious events occurred
that I began to suspect the worst. An iron

2809
04:17:41,310 --> 04:17:48,260
in the freezer, clothes in the dishwasher,
books in the oven. Other things, too. But

2810
04:17:48,260 --> 04:17:53,380
the day I found her in the car three blocks
away, crying over the steering wheel because

2811
04:17:53,380 --> 04:17:59,380
she couldn’t find her way home was the first
day I was really frightened. And she was frightened,

2812
04:17:59,380 --> 04:18:04,760
too, for when I tapped on her window, she
turned to me and said, “Oh God, what’s

2813
04:18:04,760 --> 04:18:10,680
happening to me? Please help me.” A knot
twisted in my stomach, but I dared not think

2814
04:18:10,680 --> 04:18:13,500
the worst.

2815
04:18:13,500 --> 04:18:19,180
Six days later the doctor met with her and
began a series of tests. I did not understand

2816
04:18:19,180 --> 04:18:25,300
them then and I do not understand them now,
but I suppose it is because I am afraid to

2817
04:18:25,300 --> 04:18:33,199
know. She spent almost an hour with Dr. Barnwell,
and she went back the next day. That day was

2818
04:18:33,199 --> 04:18:39,739
the longest day I ever spent. I looked through
magazines I could not read and played games

2819
04:18:39,739 --> 04:18:46,020
I did not think about. Finally he called us
both into his office and sat us down. She

2820
04:18:46,020 --> 04:18:51,350
held my arm confidently, but I remember clearly
that my own hands were shaking.

2821
04:18:51,350 --> 04:18:56,810
“I’m so sorry to have to tell you this,”
Dr. Barn-well began, “but you seem to be

2822
04:18:56,810 --> 04:19:00,440
in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. . . .”

2823
04:19:00,440 --> 04:19:06,580
My mind went blank, and all I could think
about was the light that glowed above our

2824
04:19:06,580 --> 04:19:12,420
heads. The words echoed in my head: the early
stages of Alzheimer’s . . .

2825
04:19:12,420 --> 04:19:20,560
My world spun in circles, and I felt her grip
tighten on my arm. She whispered, almost to

2826
04:19:20,560 --> 04:19:24,430
herself: “Oh, Noah . . . Noah . . .”

2827
04:19:24,430 --> 04:19:31,979
And as the tears started to fall, the word
came back to me again: . . . Alzheimer’s

2828
04:19:31,979 --> 04:19:32,979
...

2829
04:19:32,979 --> 04:19:39,690
It is a barren disease, as empty and lifeless
as a desert. It is a thief of hearts and souls

2830
04:19:39,690 --> 04:19:46,050
and memories. I did not know what to say to
her as she sobbed on my bosom, so I simply

2831
04:19:46,050 --> 04:19:49,060
held her and rocked her back and forth.

2832
04:19:49,060 --> 04:19:55,430
The doctor was grim. He was a good man, and
this was hard for him. He was younger than

2833
04:19:55,430 --> 04:20:03,390
my youngest, and I felt my age in his presence.
My mind was confused, my love was shaking,

2834
04:20:03,390 --> 04:20:07,060
and the only thing I could think was:

2835
04:20:07,060 --> 04:20:16,390
No drowning man can know which drop of water
his last breath did stop; . . .

2836
04:20:16,390 --> 04:20:23,060
A wise poet’s words, yet they brought me
no comfort. I don’t know what they meant

2837
04:20:23,060 --> 04:20:26,500
or why I thought of them.

2838
04:20:26,500 --> 04:20:35,850
We rocked to and fro, and Allie, my dream,
my timeless beauty, told me she was sorry.

2839
04:20:35,850 --> 04:20:40,470
I knew there was nothing to forgive, and I
whispered in her ear. “Everything will be

2840
04:20:40,470 --> 04:20:47,210
fine,” I whispered, but inside I was afraid.
I was a hollow man with nothing to offer,

2841
04:20:47,210 --> 04:20:51,560
empty as a junked stovepipe.

2842
04:20:51,560 --> 04:20:56,760
I remember only bits and pieces of Dr. Barnwell’s
continuing explanation.

2843
04:20:56,760 --> 04:21:04,260
“It’s a degenerative brain disorder affecting
memory and personality . . . there is no cure

2844
04:21:04,260 --> 04:21:05,260
or therapy. . . .

2845
04:21:05,260 --> 04:21:11,580
There’s no way to tell how fast it will
progress . . . it differs from person to person.

2846
04:21:11,580 --> 04:21:13,600
...I wish I knew more. . . .

2847
04:21:13,600 --> 04:21:18,689
Some days will be better than others. ...It
will grow worse with the passage of time.

2848
04:21:18,689 --> 04:21:21,930
. . . I’m sorry to be the one who has to
tell you. . . .”

2849
04:21:21,930 --> 04:21:24,439
I’m sorry . . .
I’m sorry . . .

2850
04:21:24,439 --> 04:21:32,670
I’m sorry . . .
Everyone was sorry. My children were broken-hearted,

2851
04:21:32,670 --> 04:21:39,010
my friends were scared for themselves. I don’t
remember leaving the doctor’s office, and

2852
04:21:39,010 --> 04:21:46,199
I don’t remember driving home. My memories
of that day are gone, and in this my wife

2853
04:21:46,199 --> 04:21:47,560
and I are the same.

2854
04:21:47,560 --> 04:21:55,590
It has been four years now. Since then we
have made the best of it, if that is possible.

2855
04:21:55,590 --> 04:22:01,000
Allie organized, as was her disposition. She
made arrangements to leave the house and move

2856
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:08,260
here. She rewrote her will and sealed it.
She left specific burial instructions, and

2857
04:22:08,260 --> 04:22:15,850
they sit in my desk, in the bottom drawer.
I have not seen them. And when she was finished,

2858
04:22:15,850 --> 04:22:21,460
she began to write. Letters to friends and
children. Letters to brothers and sisters

2859
04:22:21,460 --> 04:22:30,140
and cousins. Letters to nieces, nephews, and
neighbors. And a letter to me.

2860
04:22:30,140 --> 04:22:36,449
I read it sometimes when I am in the mood,
and when I do, I am reminded of Allie on cold

2861
04:22:36,449 --> 04:22:42,431
winter evenings, seated by a roaring fire
with a glass of wine at her side, reading

2862
04:22:42,431 --> 04:22:48,479
the letters I had written to her over the
years. She kept them, these letters, and now

2863
04:22:48,479 --> 04:22:53,869
I keep them, for she made me promise to do
so. She said I would know what to do with

2864
04:22:53,869 --> 04:23:01,050
them. She was right; I find I enjoy reading
bits and pieces of them just as she used to.

2865
04:23:01,050 --> 04:23:06,159
They intrigue me, these letters, for when
I sift through them I realize that romance

2866
04:23:06,159 --> 04:23:14,590
and passion are possible at any age. I see
Allie now and know I’ve never loved her

2867
04:23:14,590 --> 04:23:21,109
more, but as I read the letters, I come to
understand that I have always felt the same

2868
04:23:21,109 --> 04:23:23,330
way.

2869
04:23:23,330 --> 04:23:28,520
I read them last three evenings ago, long
after I should have been asleep. It was almost

2870
04:23:28,520 --> 04:23:32,989
two o’clock when I went to the desk and
found the stack of letters, thick and tall

2871
04:23:32,989 --> 04:23:39,640
and weathered. I untied the ribbon, itself
almost half a century old, and found the letters

2872
04:23:39,640 --> 04:23:45,751
her mother had hidden so long ago and those
from afterward. A lifetime of letters, letters

2873
04:23:45,751 --> 04:23:52,180
professing my love, letters from my heart.
I glanced through them with a smile on my

2874
04:23:52,180 --> 04:23:58,630
face, picking and choosing, and finally opened
a letter from our first anniversary.

2875
04:23:58,630 --> 04:24:00,880
I read an excerpt:

2876
04:24:00,880 --> 04:24:08,449
When I see you now—moving slowly with new
life growing inside you—I hope you know

2877
04:24:08,449 --> 04:24:16,250
how much you mean to me, and how special this
year has been. No man is more blessed than

2878
04:24:16,250 --> 04:24:25,189
me, and I love you with all my heart.
I put it aside, sifted through the stack,

2879
04:24:25,189 --> 04:24:32,020
and found another, this from a cold evening
thirty-nine years ago.

2880
04:24:32,020 --> 04:24:38,890
Sitting next to you, while our youngest daughter
sang off-key in the school Christmas show,

2881
04:24:38,890 --> 04:24:46,550
I looked at you and saw a pride that comes
only to those who feel deeply in their hearts,

2882
04:24:46,550 --> 04:24:54,140
and I knew that no man could be more lucky
than me.

2883
04:24:54,140 --> 04:24:59,029
And after our son died, the one who resembled
his mother . . . It was the hardest time we

2884
04:24:59,029 --> 04:25:04,430
ever went through, and the words still ring
true today:

2885
04:25:04,430 --> 04:25:10,680
In times of grief and sorrow I will hold you
and rock you, and take your grief and make

2886
04:25:10,680 --> 04:25:18,810
it my own. When you cry, I cry, and when you
hurt, I hurt. And together we will try to

2887
04:25:18,810 --> 04:25:25,320
hold back the floods of tears and despair
and make it through the potholed streets of

2888
04:25:25,320 --> 04:25:32,560
life.
I pause for just a moment, remembering him.

2889
04:25:32,560 --> 04:25:37,810
He was four years old at the time, just a
baby. I have lived twenty times as long as

2890
04:25:37,810 --> 04:25:44,570
he, but if asked, I would have traded my life
for his. It is a terrible thing to outlive

2891
04:25:44,570 --> 04:25:49,840
your child, a tragedy I wish upon no one.

2892
04:25:49,840 --> 04:25:55,390
I do my best to keep the tears away, sift
through some more to clear my mind, and find

2893
04:25:55,390 --> 04:26:01,771
the next from our twentieth anniversary, something
much easier to think about:

2894
04:26:01,771 --> 04:26:07,279
When I see you, my darling, in the morning
before showers or in your studio covered with

2895
04:26:07,279 --> 04:26:14,100
paint with hair matted and tired eyes, I know
that you are the most beautiful woman in the

2896
04:26:14,100 --> 04:26:19,680
world.
They went on, this correspondence of life

2897
04:26:19,680 --> 04:26:27,260
and love, and I read dozens more, some painful,
most heartwarming. By three o’clock I was

2898
04:26:27,260 --> 04:26:32,410
tired, but I had reached the bottom of the
stack. There was one letter remaining, the

2899
04:26:32,410 --> 04:26:37,470
last one I wrote her, and by then I knew I
had to keep going.

2900
04:26:37,470 --> 04:26:44,949
I lifted the seal and removed both pages.
I put the second page aside and moved the

2901
04:26:44,949 --> 04:26:48,529
first page into better light and began to
read:

2902
04:26:48,529 --> 04:26:54,430
My dearest Allie,
The porch is silent except for the sounds

2903
04:26:54,430 --> 04:27:01,250
that float from the shadows, and for once
I am at a loss for words. It is a strange

2904
04:27:01,250 --> 04:27:06,010
experience for me, for when I think of you
and the life we have shared, there is much

2905
04:27:06,010 --> 04:27:14,300
to remember. A lifetime of memories. But to
put it into words? I do not know if I am able.

2906
04:27:14,300 --> 04:27:21,340
I am not a poet, and yet a poem is needed
to fully express the way I feel about you.

2907
04:27:21,340 --> 04:27:26,790
So my mind drifts, and I remember thinking
about our life together as I made coffee this

2908
04:27:26,790 --> 04:27:33,170
morning. Kate was there, and so was Jane,
and they both became quiet when I walked in

2909
04:27:33,170 --> 04:27:39,550
the kitchen. I saw they’d been crying, and
without a word, I sat myself beside them at

2910
04:27:39,550 --> 04:27:46,470
the table and held their hands. And do you
know what I saw when I looked at them? I saw

2911
04:27:46,470 --> 04:27:55,660
you from so long ago, the day we said good-bye.
They resemble you and how you were then, beautiful

2912
04:27:55,660 --> 04:28:03,140
and sensitive and wounded with the hurt that
comes when something special is taken away.

2913
04:28:03,140 --> 04:28:10,350
And for a reason I’m not sure I understand,
I was inspired to tell them a story.

2914
04:28:10,350 --> 04:28:16,260
I called Jeff and David into the kitchen,
for they were here as well, and when the children

2915
04:28:16,260 --> 04:28:22,689
were ready, I told them about us and how you
came back to me so long ago. I told them about

2916
04:28:22,689 --> 04:28:28,319
our walk, and the crab dinner in the kitchen,
and they listened with smiles when they heard

2917
04:28:28,319 --> 04:28:34,220
about the canoe ride, and sitting in front
of the fire with the storm raging outside.

2918
04:28:34,220 --> 04:28:40,550
I told them about your mother warning us about
Lon the next day—they seemed as surprised

2919
04:28:40,550 --> 04:28:45,609
as we were—and yes, I even told them what
happened later that day, after you went back

2920
04:28:45,609 --> 04:28:50,880
to town.
That part of the story has never left me,

2921
04:28:50,880 --> 04:28:56,300
even after all this time. Even though I wasn’t
there, you described it to me only once, and

2922
04:28:56,300 --> 04:29:02,070
I remember marveling at the strength you showed
that day. I still cannot imagine what was

2923
04:29:02,070 --> 04:29:06,899
going through your mind when you walked into
the lobby and saw Lon, or how it must have

2924
04:29:06,899 --> 04:29:12,320
felt to talk to him. You told me that the
two of you left the inn and sat on a bench

2925
04:29:12,320 --> 04:29:18,070
by the old Methodist church, and that he held
your hand, even as you explained that you

2926
04:29:18,070 --> 04:29:22,819
must stay.
I know you cared for him. And his reaction

2927
04:29:22,819 --> 04:29:29,290
proves to me he cared for you as well. No,
he could not understand losing you, but how

2928
04:29:29,290 --> 04:29:34,760
could he? Even as you explained that you had
always loved me, and that it wouldn’t be

2929
04:29:34,760 --> 04:29:40,159
fair to him, he
did not release your hand. I know he was hurt

2930
04:29:40,159 --> 04:29:46,640
and angry, and tried for almost an hour to
change your mind, but when you stood firm

2931
04:29:46,640 --> 04:29:52,040
and said, “I can’t go back with you, I’m
so sorry,” he knew that your decision had

2932
04:29:52,040 --> 04:29:58,189
been made. You said he simply nodded and the
two of you sat together for a long time without

2933
04:29:58,189 --> 04:30:04,460
speaking. I have always wondered what he was
thinking as he sat with you, but I’m sure

2934
04:30:04,460 --> 04:30:10,260
it was the same way I felt only a few hours
before. And when he finally walked you to

2935
04:30:10,260 --> 04:30:19,370
your car, you said he told you that I was
a lucky man. He behaved as a gentleman would,

2936
04:30:19,370 --> 04:30:23,350
and I understood then why your choice was
so hard.

2937
04:30:23,350 --> 04:30:28,819
I remember that when I finished the story,
the room was quiet until Kate finally stood

2938
04:30:28,819 --> 04:30:35,689
to embrace me. “Oh, Daddy,” she said with
tears in her eyes, and though I expected to

2939
04:30:35,689 --> 04:30:42,470
answer their questions, they did not ask any.
Instead, they gave me something much more

2940
04:30:42,470 --> 04:30:47,260
special.
For the next four hours, each of them told

2941
04:30:47,260 --> 04:30:54,569
me how much we, the two of us, had meant to
them growing up. One by one, they told stories

2942
04:30:54,569 --> 04:31:02,010
about things I had long since forgotten. And
by the end, I was crying because I realized

2943
04:31:02,010 --> 04:31:09,979
how well we had done with raising them. I
was so proud of them, and proud of you, and

2944
04:31:09,979 --> 04:31:17,420
happy about the life we have led. And nothing
will ever take that away. Nothing. I only

2945
04:31:17,420 --> 04:31:23,260
wish you would have been here to enjoy it
with me.

2946
04:31:23,260 --> 04:31:29,069
After they left, I rocked in silence, thinking
back on our life together. You are always

2947
04:31:29,069 --> 04:31:35,479
here with me when I do so, at least in my
heart, and it is impossible for me to remember

2948
04:31:35,479 --> 04:31:42,760
a time when you were not a part of me. I do
not know who I would have become had you never

2949
04:31:42,760 --> 04:31:49,649
come back to me that day, but I have no doubt
that I would have lived and died with regrets

2950
04:31:49,649 --> 04:31:57,930
that thankfully I’ll never know.
I love you, Allie. I am who I am because of

2951
04:31:57,930 --> 04:32:05,510
you. You are every reason, every hope, and
every dream I’ve ever had, and no matter

2952
04:32:05,510 --> 04:32:12,220
what happens to us in the future, every day
we are together is the greatest day of my

2953
04:32:12,220 --> 04:32:21,640
life. I will always be yours.
And, my darling, you will always be mine.

2954
04:32:21,640 --> 04:32:30,560
Noah
I put the pages aside and remember sitting

2955
04:32:30,560 --> 04:32:37,580
with Allie on our porch when she read this
letter for the first time. It was late afternoon,

2956
04:32:37,580 --> 04:32:43,689
with red streaks cutting the summer sky, and
the last remnants of the day were fading.

2957
04:32:43,689 --> 04:32:49,931
The sky was slowly changing color, and as
I was watching the sun go down, I remember

2958
04:32:49,931 --> 04:32:56,590
thinking about that brief, flickering moment
when day suddenly turns into night.

2959
04:32:56,590 --> 04:33:04,529
Dusk, I realized then, is just an illusion,
because the sun is either above the horizon

2960
04:33:04,529 --> 04:33:12,230
or below it. And that means that day and night
are linked in a way that few things are; there

2961
04:33:12,230 --> 04:33:20,459
cannot be one without the other, yet they
cannot exist at the same time. How would it

2962
04:33:20,459 --> 04:33:29,721
feel, I remember wondering, to be always together,
yet forever apart?

2963
04:33:29,721 --> 04:33:34,480
Looking back, I find it ironic that she chose
to read the letter at the exact moment that

2964
04:33:34,480 --> 04:33:42,311
question popped into my head. It is ironic,
of course, because I know the answer now.

2965
04:33:42,311 --> 04:33:52,189
I know what it’s like to be day and night
now; always together, forever apart.

2966
04:33:52,189 --> 04:34:00,701
There is beauty where we sit this afternoon,
Allie and I. This is the pinnacle of my life.

2967
04:34:00,701 --> 04:34:07,219
They are here at the creek: the birds, the
geese, my friends. Their bodies float on the

2968
04:34:07,219 --> 04:34:11,969
cool water, which reflects bits and pieces
of their colors and make them seem larger

2969
04:34:11,969 --> 04:34:18,490
than they really are. Allie too is taken in
by their wonder, and little by little we get

2970
04:34:18,490 --> 04:34:21,109
to know each other again.

2971
04:34:21,109 --> 04:34:29,299
“It’s good to talk to you. I find that
I miss it, even when it hasn’t been that

2972
04:34:29,299 --> 04:34:30,969
long.”

2973
04:34:30,969 --> 04:34:36,320
I am sincere and she knows this, but she is
still wary. I am a stranger.

2974
04:34:36,320 --> 04:34:45,000
“Is this something we do often?” she asks.
“Do we sit here and watch the birds a lot?

2975
04:34:45,000 --> 04:34:49,211
I mean, do we know each other well?”

2976
04:34:49,211 --> 04:35:00,250
“Yes and no. I think everyone has secrets,
but we have been acquainted for years.”

2977
04:35:00,250 --> 04:35:06,760
She looks to her hands, then mine. She thinks
about this for a moment, her face at such

2978
04:35:06,760 --> 04:35:14,250
an angle that she looks young again. We do
not wear our rings. Again, there is a reason

2979
04:35:14,250 --> 04:35:17,070
for this. She asks:

2980
04:35:17,070 --> 04:35:20,000
“Were you ever married?”

2981
04:35:20,000 --> 04:35:22,020
I nod.

2982
04:35:22,020 --> 04:35:23,029
“Yes.”

2983
04:35:23,029 --> 04:35:24,510
“What was she like?”

2984
04:35:24,510 --> 04:35:27,189
I tell the truth.

2985
04:35:27,189 --> 04:35:34,561
“She was my dream. She made me who I am,
and holding her in my arms was more natural

2986
04:35:34,561 --> 04:35:39,840
to me than my own heartbeat. I think about
her all the time. Even now, when I’m sitting

2987
04:35:39,840 --> 04:35:45,859
here, I think about her. There could never
have been another.”

2988
04:35:45,859 --> 04:35:52,340
She takes this in. I don’t know how she
feels about this. Finally she speaks softly,

2989
04:35:52,340 --> 04:35:58,650
her voice angelic, sensual. I wonder if she
knows I think these things.

2990
04:35:58,650 --> 04:36:01,010
“Is she dead?”

2991
04:36:01,010 --> 04:36:10,180
What is death? I wonder, but I do not say
this. Instead I answer, “My wife is alive

2992
04:36:10,180 --> 04:36:14,010
in my heart. And she always will be.”

2993
04:36:14,010 --> 04:36:17,840
“You still love her, don’t you?”

2994
04:36:17,840 --> 04:36:24,520
“Of course. But I love many things. I love
to sit here with you. I love to share the

2995
04:36:24,520 --> 04:36:30,949
beauty of this place with someone I care about.
I love to watch the osprey swoop toward the

2996
04:36:30,949 --> 04:36:34,881
creek and find its dinner.”

2997
04:36:34,881 --> 04:36:40,090
She is quiet for a moment. She looks away
so I can’t see her face. It has been her

2998
04:36:40,090 --> 04:36:42,359
habit for years.

2999
04:36:42,359 --> 04:36:51,680
“Why are you doing this?” No fear, just
curiosity. This is good. I know what she means,

3000
04:36:51,680 --> 04:36:53,230
but I ask anyway.

3001
04:36:53,230 --> 04:36:54,230
“What?”

3002
04:36:54,230 --> 04:37:01,330
“Why are you spending the day with me?”
I smile.

3003
04:37:01,330 --> 04:37:08,632
“I’m here because this is where I’m
supposed to be. It’s not complicated. Both

3004
04:37:08,632 --> 04:37:15,510
you and I are enjoying ourselves. Don’t
dismiss my time with you—it’s not wasted.

3005
04:37:15,510 --> 04:37:23,080
It’s what I want. I sit here and we talk
and I think to myself, What could be better

3006
04:37:23,080 --> 04:37:27,129
than what I am doing now?”

3007
04:37:27,129 --> 04:37:34,400
She looks me in the eyes, and for a moment,
just a moment, her eyes twinkle. A slight

3008
04:37:34,400 --> 04:37:36,730
smile forms on her lips.

3009
04:37:36,730 --> 04:37:46,289
“I like being with you, but if getting me
intrigued is what you’re after, you’ve

3010
04:37:46,289 --> 04:37:53,831
succeeded. I admit I enjoy your company, but
I know nothing about you. I don’t expect

3011
04:37:53,831 --> 04:37:59,830
you to tell me your life story, but why are
you so mysterious?”

3012
04:37:59,830 --> 04:38:04,871
“I read once that women love mysterious
strangers.”

3013
04:38:04,871 --> 04:38:13,709
“See, you haven’t really answered the
question. You haven’t answered most of my

3014
04:38:13,709 --> 04:38:19,061
questions. You didn’t even tell me how the
story ended this morning.”

3015
04:38:19,061 --> 04:38:29,730
I shrug. We sit quietly for a while. Finally
I ask: “Is it true?”

3016
04:38:29,730 --> 04:38:31,631
“Is what true?”

3017
04:38:31,631 --> 04:38:36,330
“That women love mysterious strangers?”

3018
04:38:36,330 --> 04:38:41,480
She thinks about this and laughs. Then she
answers as I would:

3019
04:38:41,480 --> 04:38:44,590
“I think some women do.”

3020
04:38:44,590 --> 04:38:46,371
“Do you?”

3021
04:38:46,371 --> 04:38:54,609
“Now don’t go putting me on the spot.
I don’t know you well enough for that.”

3022
04:38:54,609 --> 04:38:59,430
She is teasing me, and I enjoy it.

3023
04:38:59,430 --> 04:39:05,859
We sit silently and watch the world around
us. This has taken us a lifetime to learn.

3024
04:39:05,859 --> 04:39:10,539
It seems only the old are able to sit next
to one another and not say anything and still

3025
04:39:10,539 --> 04:39:20,250
feel content. The young, brash and impatient,
must always break the silence. It is a waste,

3026
04:39:20,250 --> 04:39:27,920
for silence is pure. Silence is holy. It draws
people together because only those who are

3027
04:39:27,920 --> 04:39:34,439
comfortable with each other can sit without
speaking. This is the great paradox.

3028
04:39:34,439 --> 04:39:44,931
Time passes, and gradually our breathing begins
to coincide just as it did this morning. Deep

3029
04:39:44,931 --> 04:39:52,810
breaths, relaxed breaths, and there is a moment
when she dozes off, like those comfortable

3030
04:39:52,810 --> 04:40:00,730
with one another often do. I wonder if the
young are capable of enjoying this. Finally,

3031
04:40:00,730 --> 04:40:02,620
when she wakes, a miracle.

3032
04:40:02,620 --> 04:40:08,230
“Do you see that bird?” She points to
it, and I strain my eyes. It is a wonder I

3033
04:40:08,230 --> 04:40:14,330
can see it, but I can because the sun is bright.
I point, too.

3034
04:40:14,330 --> 04:40:21,638
“Caspian stern,” I say softly, and we
devote our attention to it and stare as it

3035
04:40:21,638 --> 04:40:29,180
glides over Brices Creek. And, like an old
habit rediscovered, when I lower my arm, I

3036
04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:37,200
put my hand on her knee and she doesn’t
make me move it.

3037
04:40:37,200 --> 04:40:44,138
She is right about my evasiveness. On days
like these, when only her memory is gone,

3038
04:40:44,138 --> 04:40:50,450
I am vague in my answers because I’ve hurt
my wife unintentionally with careless slips

3039
04:40:50,450 --> 04:40:58,330
of my tongue many times these past few years,
and I am determined not to let it happen again.

3040
04:40:58,330 --> 04:41:06,560
So I limit myself and answer only what is
asked, sometimes not too well, and I volunteer

3041
04:41:06,560 --> 04:41:08,862
nothing.

3042
04:41:08,862 --> 04:41:15,048
This is a split decision, both good and bad,
but necessary, for with knowledge comes pain.

3043
04:41:15,048 --> 04:41:21,708
To limit the pain I limit my answers. There
are days she never learns of her children

3044
04:41:21,708 --> 04:41:27,670
or that we are married. I am sorry for this,
but I will not change.

3045
04:41:27,670 --> 04:41:34,940
Does this make me dishonest? Perhaps, but
I have seen her crushed by the waterfall of

3046
04:41:34,940 --> 04:41:40,968
information that is her life. Could I look
myself in the mirror without red eyes and

3047
04:41:40,968 --> 04:41:48,540
quivering jaw and know I have forgotten all
that was important to me? I could not and

3048
04:41:48,540 --> 04:41:55,830
neither can she, for when this odyssey began,
this is how I began. Her life, her marriage,

3049
04:41:55,830 --> 04:42:03,128
her children. Her friends and her work. Questions
and answers in the game show format of This

3050
04:42:03,128 --> 04:42:05,080
Is Your Life.

3051
04:42:05,080 --> 04:42:11,660
The days were hard on both of us. I was an
encyclopedia, an object without feeling, of

3052
04:42:11,660 --> 04:42:18,270
the whos, whats and wheres in her life, when
in reality it is the whys, the things I did

3053
04:42:18,270 --> 04:42:23,990
not know and could not answer, that make it
all worthwhile. She would stare at pictures

3054
04:42:23,990 --> 04:42:30,030
of forgotten offspring, hold paintbrushes
that inspired nothing, and read love letters

3055
04:42:30,030 --> 04:42:37,150
that brought back no joy. She would weaken
over the hours, growing paler, becoming bitter,

3056
04:42:37,150 --> 04:42:44,160
and ending the day worse than when it began.
Our days were lost, and so was she. And selfishly,

3057
04:42:44,160 --> 04:42:47,160
so was I.

3058
04:42:47,160 --> 04:42:54,388
So I changed. I became Magellan or Columbus,
an explorer in the mysteries of the mind,

3059
04:42:54,388 --> 04:43:01,850
and I learned, bumbling and slow, but learning
nonetheless what had to be done. And I learned

3060
04:43:01,850 --> 04:43:09,080
what is obvious to a child. That life is simply
a collection of little lives, each lived one

3061
04:43:09,080 --> 04:43:16,298
day at a time. That each day should be spent
finding beauty in flowers and poetry and talking

3062
04:43:16,298 --> 04:43:23,080
to animals. That a day spent with dreaming
and sunsets and refreshing breezes cannot

3063
04:43:23,080 --> 04:43:32,900
be bettered. But most of all, I learned that
life is about sitting on benches next to ancient

3064
04:43:32,900 --> 04:43:42,510
creeks with my hand on her knee and sometimes,
on good days, for falling in love.

3065
04:43:42,510 --> 04:43:50,340
“What are you thinking?” she asks.

3066
04:43:50,340 --> 04:43:56,760
It is now dusk. We have left our bench and
are shuffling along lighted paths that wind

3067
04:43:56,760 --> 04:44:03,870
their way around this complex. She is holding
my arm, and I am her escort. It is her idea

3068
04:44:03,870 --> 04:44:10,040
to do this. Perhaps she is charmed by me.
Perhaps she wants to keep me from falling.

3069
04:44:10,040 --> 04:44:13,800
Either way, I am smiling to myself.

3070
04:44:13,800 --> 04:44:18,610
“I’m thinking about you.”

3071
04:44:18,610 --> 04:44:26,310
She makes no response to this except to squeeze
my arm, and I can tell she likes what I said.

3072
04:44:26,310 --> 04:44:34,560
Our life together has enabled me to see the
clues, even if she does not know them herself.

3073
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:35,560
I go on:

3074
04:44:35,560 --> 04:44:40,030
“I know you can’t remember who you are,
but I can, and I find that when I look at

3075
04:44:40,030 --> 04:44:44,270
you, it makes me feel good.”

3076
04:44:44,270 --> 04:44:52,240
She taps my arm and smiles. “You’re a
kind man with a loving heart. I hope I enjoyed

3077
04:44:52,240 --> 04:44:57,128
you as much before as I do now.”

3078
04:44:57,128 --> 04:45:02,850
We walk some more. Finally she says, “I
have to tell you something.”

3079
04:45:02,850 --> 04:45:04,830
“Go ahead.”

3080
04:45:04,830 --> 04:45:10,760
“I think I have an admirer.”

3081
04:45:10,760 --> 04:45:12,740
“An admirer?”

3082
04:45:12,740 --> 04:45:13,740
“Yes.”

3083
04:45:13,740 --> 04:45:15,700
“I see.”

3084
04:45:15,700 --> 04:45:19,650
“You don’t believe me?”

3085
04:45:19,650 --> 04:45:22,620
“I believe you.”

3086
04:45:22,620 --> 04:45:24,600
“You should.”

3087
04:45:24,600 --> 04:45:25,600
“Why?”

3088
04:45:25,600 --> 04:45:31,638
“Because I think it is you.”

3089
04:45:31,638 --> 04:45:37,380
I think about this as we walk in silence,
holding each other, past the rooms, past the

3090
04:45:37,380 --> 04:45:45,490
courtyard. We come to the garden, mainly wildflowers,
and I stop her. I pick a bundle—red, pink,

3091
04:45:45,490 --> 04:45:51,750
yellow, violet. I give them to her, and she
brings them to her nose. She smells them with

3092
04:45:51,750 --> 04:45:58,500
eyes closed and she whispers, “They’re
beautiful.” We resume our walk, me in one

3093
04:45:58,500 --> 04:46:04,218
hand, the flowers in another. People watch
us, for we are a walking miracle, or so I

3094
04:46:04,218 --> 04:46:10,160
am told. It is true in a way, though most
times I do not feel lucky.

3095
04:46:10,160 --> 04:46:13,650
“You think it’s me?” I finally ask.

3096
04:46:13,650 --> 04:46:14,650
“Yes.”

3097
04:46:14,650 --> 04:46:15,650
“Why?”

3098
04:46:15,650 --> 04:46:22,670
“Because I have found what you have hidden.”
“What?”

3099
04:46:22,670 --> 04:46:32,230
“This,” she says, handing a small slip
of paper to me. “I found it under my pillow.”

3100
04:46:32,230 --> 04:46:34,968
I read it, and it says:

3101
04:46:34,968 --> 04:46:43,120
The body slows with mortal ache, yet my promise
remains true at the closing of our days,

3102
04:46:43,120 --> 04:46:49,100
A tender touch that ends with a kiss will
awaken love in joyous ways.

3103
04:46:49,100 --> 04:46:52,760
“Are there more?” I ask.

3104
04:46:52,760 --> 04:46:57,548
“I found this in the pocket of my coat.”

3105
04:46:57,548 --> 04:47:03,830
Our souls were one, if you must know and never
shall they be apart;

3106
04:47:03,830 --> 04:47:07,260
With splendid dawn, your face aglow

3107
04:47:07,260 --> 04:47:11,530
I reach for you and find my heart.

3108
04:47:11,530 --> 04:47:19,360
“I see,” and that is all I say.

3109
04:47:19,360 --> 04:47:25,980
We walk as the sun sinks lower in the sky.
In time, silver twilight is the only remainder

3110
04:47:25,980 --> 04:47:34,540
of the day, and still we talk of the poetry.
She is enthralled by the romance.

3111
04:47:34,540 --> 04:47:39,639
By the time we reach the doorway, I am tired.
She knows this, so she stops me with her hand

3112
04:47:39,639 --> 04:47:46,460
and makes me face her. I do and I realize
how hunched over I have become. She and I

3113
04:47:46,460 --> 04:47:53,350
are now level. Sometimes I am glad she doesn’t
know how much I have changed. She turns to

3114
04:47:53,350 --> 04:47:55,388
me and stares for a long time.

3115
04:47:55,388 --> 04:47:59,958
“What are you doing?” I ask.

3116
04:47:59,958 --> 04:48:06,740
“I don’t want to forget you or this day,
and I’m trying to keep your memory alive.”

3117
04:48:06,740 --> 04:48:17,620
Will it work this time? I wonder, then know
it will not. It can’t. I do not tell her

3118
04:48:17,620 --> 04:48:21,968
my thoughts, though. I smile instead because
her words are sweet.

3119
04:48:21,968 --> 04:48:23,840
“Thank you,” I say.

3120
04:48:23,840 --> 04:48:31,330
“I mean it. I don’t want to forget you
again. You’re very special to me. I don’t

3121
04:48:31,330 --> 04:48:35,500
know what I would have done without you today.”

3122
04:48:35,500 --> 04:48:41,910
My throat closes a little. There is emotion
behind her words, the emotions I feel whenever

3123
04:48:41,910 --> 04:48:50,110
I think of her. I know this is why I live,
and I love her dearly at this moment. How

3124
04:48:50,110 --> 04:48:55,138
I wish I were strong enough to carry her in
my arms to paradise.

3125
04:48:55,138 --> 04:49:01,700
“Don’t try to say anything,” she tells
me. “Let’s just feel the moment.”

3126
04:49:01,700 --> 04:49:10,800
And I do, and I feel heaven.

3127
04:49:10,800 --> 04:49:20,480
Her disease is worse now than it was in the
beginning, though Allie is different from

3128
04:49:20,480 --> 04:49:25,590
most. There are three others with the disease
here, and these three are the sum of my practical

3129
04:49:25,590 --> 04:49:31,770
experience with it. They, unlike Allie, are
in the most advanced stages of Alzheimer’s

3130
04:49:31,770 --> 04:49:37,958
and are almost completely lost. They wake
up hallucinating and confused. They repeat

3131
04:49:37,958 --> 04:49:44,630
themselves over and over. Two of the three
can’t feed themselves and will die soon.

3132
04:49:44,630 --> 04:49:51,548
The third has a tendency to wander and get
lost. She was found once in a stranger’s

3133
04:49:51,548 --> 04:49:59,550
car a quarter mile away. Since then she has
been strapped to the bed. All can be very

3134
04:49:59,550 --> 04:50:06,341
bitter at times, and at other times they can
be like lost children, sad and alone. Seldom

3135
04:50:06,341 --> 04:50:12,910
do they recognize the staff or people who
love them. It is a trying disease, and this

3136
04:50:12,910 --> 04:50:17,400
is why it is hard for their children and mine
to visit.

3137
04:50:17,400 --> 04:50:22,980
Allie, of course, has her own problems, too,
problems that will probably grow worse over

3138
04:50:22,980 --> 04:50:31,590
time. She is terribly afraid in the mornings
and cries inconsolably. She sees tiny people,

3139
04:50:31,590 --> 04:50:38,540
like gnomes, I think, watching her, and she
screams at them to get away. She bathes willingly

3140
04:50:38,540 --> 04:50:45,410
but will not eat regularly. She is thin now,
much too thin, in my opinion, and on good

3141
04:50:45,410 --> 04:50:48,190
days I do my best to fatten her up.

3142
04:50:48,190 --> 04:50:54,251
But this is where the similarity ends. This
is why Allie is considered a miracle, because

3143
04:50:54,251 --> 04:51:01,790
sometimes, just sometimes, after I read to
her, her condition isn’t so bad. There is

3144
04:51:01,790 --> 04:51:08,560
no explanation for this. “It’s impossible,”
the doctors say. “She must not have Alzheimer’s.”

3145
04:51:08,560 --> 04:51:16,628
But she does. On most days and every morning
there can be no doubt. On this there is agreement.

3146
04:51:16,628 --> 04:51:23,330
But why, then, is her condition different?
Why does she sometimes change after I read?

3147
04:51:23,330 --> 04:51:30,280
I tell the doctors the reason—I know it
in my heart, but I am not believed. Instead

3148
04:51:30,280 --> 04:51:36,940
they look to science. Four times specialists
have traveled from Chapel Hill to find the

3149
04:51:36,940 --> 04:51:44,112
answer. Four times they have left without
understanding. I tell them, “You can’t

3150
04:51:44,112 --> 04:51:49,670
possibly understand it if you use only your
training and your books,” but they shake

3151
04:51:49,670 --> 04:51:55,060
their heads and answer: “Alzheimer’s does
not work like this. With her condition, it’s

3152
04:51:55,060 --> 04:52:01,600
just not possible to have a conversation or
improve as the day goes on. Ever.”

3153
04:52:01,600 --> 04:52:08,120
But she does. Not every day, not most of the
time, and definitely less than she used to.

3154
04:52:08,120 --> 04:52:17,990
But sometimes. And all that is gone on these
days is her memory, as if she has amnesia.

3155
04:52:17,990 --> 04:52:23,958
But her emotions are normal, her thoughts
are normal. And these are the days that I

3156
04:52:23,958 --> 04:52:31,850
know I am doing right.

3157
04:52:31,850 --> 04:52:37,390
Dinner is waiting in her room when we return.
It has been arranged for us to eat here, as

3158
04:52:37,390 --> 04:52:43,830
it always is on days like these, and once
again I could ask for no more. The people

3159
04:52:43,830 --> 04:52:48,510
here take care of everything. They are good
to me, and I am thankful.

3160
04:52:48,510 --> 04:52:53,450
The lights are dimmed, the room is lit by
two candles on the table where we will sit,

3161
04:52:53,450 --> 04:52:59,872
and music is playing softly in the background.
The cups and plates are plastic, and the carafe

3162
04:52:59,872 --> 04:53:05,720
is filled with apple juice, but rules are
rules and she doesn’t seem to care. She

3163
04:53:05,720 --> 04:53:09,790
inhales slightly at the sight. Her eyes are
wide.

3164
04:53:09,790 --> 04:53:12,570
“Did you do this?”

3165
04:53:12,570 --> 04:53:15,890
I nod and she walks in the room.

3166
04:53:15,890 --> 04:53:18,782
“It looks beautiful.”

3167
04:53:18,782 --> 04:53:26,590
I offer my arm in escort and lead her to the
window. She doesn’t release it when we get

3168
04:53:26,590 --> 04:53:35,690
there. Her touch is nice, and we stand close
together on this crystal springtime evening.

3169
04:53:35,690 --> 04:53:43,450
The window is open slightly, and I feel a
breeze as it fans my cheek. The moon has risen,

3170
04:53:43,450 --> 04:53:47,780
and we watch for a long time as the evening
sky unfolds.

3171
04:53:47,780 --> 04:53:55,770
“I’ve never seen anything so beautiful,
I’m sure of it,” she says, and I agree

3172
04:53:55,770 --> 04:53:56,968
with her.

3173
04:53:56,968 --> 04:54:04,720
“I haven’t, either,” I say, but I am
looking at her. She knows what I mean, and

3174
04:54:04,720 --> 04:54:08,970
I see her smile. A moment later she whispers:

3175
04:54:08,970 --> 04:54:16,570
“I think I know who Allie went with at the
end of the story,” she says.

3176
04:54:16,570 --> 04:54:18,958
“You do?”

3177
04:54:18,958 --> 04:54:20,150
“Yes.”

3178
04:54:20,150 --> 04:54:21,340
“Who?”

3179
04:54:21,340 --> 04:54:25,000
“She went with Noah.”

3180
04:54:25,000 --> 04:54:27,620
“You’re sure?”

3181
04:54:27,620 --> 04:54:28,930
“Absolutely.”

3182
04:54:28,930 --> 04:54:42,510
I smile and nod. “Yes, she did,” I say
softly, and she smiles back. Her face is radiant.

3183
04:54:42,510 --> 04:54:50,900
I pull out her chair with some effort. She
sits and I sit opposite her. She offers her

3184
04:54:50,900 --> 04:54:57,140
hand across the table, and I take it in mine,
and I feel her thumb begin to move as it did

3185
04:54:57,140 --> 04:55:06,330
so many years ago. Without speaking, I stare
at her for a long time, living and reliving

3186
04:55:06,330 --> 04:55:14,430
the moments of my life, remembering it all
and making it real. I feel my throat begin

3187
04:55:14,430 --> 04:55:22,780
to tighten, and once again I realize how much
I love her. My voice is shaky when I finally

3188
04:55:22,780 --> 04:55:24,010
speak.

3189
04:55:24,010 --> 04:55:32,650
“You’re so beautiful,” I say. I can
see in her eyes that she knows how I feel

3190
04:55:32,650 --> 04:55:36,520
about her and what I really mean by my words.

3191
04:55:36,520 --> 04:55:42,220
She does not respond. Instead she lowers her
eyes and I wonder what she’s thinking. She

3192
04:55:42,220 --> 04:55:51,690
gives me no clues, and I gently squeeze her
hand. I wait. With all my dreams, I know her

3193
04:55:51,690 --> 04:55:54,550
heart, and I know I’m almost there.

3194
04:55:54,550 --> 04:55:59,420
And then, a miracle that proves me right.

3195
04:55:59,420 --> 04:56:06,160
As Glenn Miller plays softly in a candlelit
room, I watch as she gradually gives in to

3196
04:56:06,160 --> 04:56:13,260
the feelings inside her. I see a warm smile
begin to form on her lips, the kind that makes

3197
04:56:13,260 --> 04:56:21,378
it all worthwhile, and I watch as she raises
her hazy eyes to mine. She pulls my hand toward

3198
04:56:21,378 --> 04:56:22,740
her.

3199
04:56:22,740 --> 04:56:30,840
“You’re wonderful. . . .” she says softly,
trailing off, and at that moment she falls

3200
04:56:30,840 --> 04:56:39,220
in love with me, too; this I know, for I have
seen the signs a thousand times.

3201
04:56:39,220 --> 04:56:44,808
She says nothing else right away, she doesn’t
have to, and she gives me a look from another

3202
04:56:44,808 --> 04:56:53,010
lifetime that makes me whole again. I smile
back, with as much passion as I can muster,

3203
04:56:53,010 --> 04:56:59,510
and we stare at each other with the feelings
inside us rolling like ocean waves. I look

3204
04:56:59,510 --> 04:57:05,020
around the room, then up to the ceiling, then
back at Allie, and the way she’s looking

3205
04:57:05,020 --> 04:57:13,420
at me makes me warm. And suddenly I feel young
again. I’m no longer cold or aching, or

3206
04:57:13,420 --> 04:57:18,720
hunched over or deformed, or almost blind
with cataractal eyes.

3207
04:57:18,720 --> 04:57:26,208
I’m strong and proud, and the luckiest man
alive, and I keep on feeling that way for

3208
04:57:26,208 --> 04:57:30,150
a long time across the table.

3209
04:57:30,150 --> 04:57:35,830
By the time the candles have burned down a
third, I am ready to break the silence. I

3210
04:57:35,830 --> 04:57:41,600
say, “I love you deeply, and I hope you
know that.”

3211
04:57:41,600 --> 04:57:51,010
“Of course I do,” she says breathlessly.
“I’ve always loved you, Noah.”

3212
04:57:51,010 --> 04:58:02,170
Noah, I hear again. Noah. The word echoes
in my head. Noah . . . Noah. She knows, I

3213
04:58:02,170 --> 04:58:06,360
think to myself, she knows who I am. . . .

3214
04:58:06,360 --> 04:58:09,770
She knows. . . .

3215
04:58:09,770 --> 04:58:18,070
Such a tiny thing, this knowledge, but for
me it is a gift from God, and I feel our lifetime

3216
04:58:18,070 --> 04:58:24,320
together, holding her, loving her, and being
with her through the best years of my life.

3217
04:58:24,320 --> 04:58:33,390
She murmurs, “Noah . . . my sweet Noah . . .” And
I, who could not accept the doctor’s words,

3218
04:58:33,390 --> 04:58:40,170
have triumphed again, at least for a moment.
I give up the pretense of mystery, and I kiss

3219
04:58:40,170 --> 04:58:45,030
her hand and bring it to my cheek and whisper
in her ear. I say:

3220
04:58:45,030 --> 04:58:49,450
“You are the greatest thing that has ever
happened to me.”

3221
04:58:49,450 --> 04:58:57,558
“Oh . . . Noah,” she says with tears in
her eyes, “I love you, too.”

3222
04:58:57,558 --> 04:59:06,120
If only it would end like this, I would be
a happy man.

3223
04:59:06,120 --> 04:59:13,200
But it won’t. Of this I’m sure, for as
time slips by, I begin to see the signs of

3224
04:59:13,200 --> 04:59:15,090
concern in her face.

3225
04:59:15,090 --> 04:59:20,750
“What’s wrong?” I ask, and her answer
comes softly.

3226
04:59:20,750 --> 04:59:27,730
“I’m so afraid. I’m afraid of forgetting
you again. It isn’t fair ...I just can’t

3227
04:59:27,730 --> 04:59:30,520
bear to give this up.”

3228
04:59:30,520 --> 04:59:37,840
Her voice breaks as she finishes, but I don’t
know what to say. I know the evening is coming

3229
04:59:37,840 --> 04:59:46,298
to an end, and there is nothing I can do to
stop the inevitable. In this I am a failure.

3230
04:59:46,298 --> 04:59:48,860
I finally tell her:

3231
04:59:48,860 --> 04:59:56,610
“I’ll never leave you. What we have is
forever.” She knows this is all I can do,

3232
04:59:56,610 --> 05:00:02,340
for neither of us wants empty promises. But
I can tell by the way she is looking at me

3233
05:00:02,340 --> 05:00:06,840
that once again she wishes there were more.

3234
05:00:06,840 --> 05:00:13,058
The crickets serenade us, and we begin to
pick at our dinner. Neither one of us is hungry,

3235
05:00:13,058 --> 05:00:20,290
but I lead by example and she follows me.
She takes small bites and chews a long time,

3236
05:00:20,290 --> 05:00:25,208
but I am glad to see her eat. She has lost
too much weight in the past three months.

3237
05:00:25,208 --> 05:00:31,950
After dinner, I become afraid despite myself.
I know I should be joyous, for this reunion

3238
05:00:31,950 --> 05:00:38,340
is the proof that love can still be ours,
but I know the bell has tolled this evening.

3239
05:00:38,340 --> 05:00:46,878
The sun has long since set and the thief is
about to come, and there is nothing I can

3240
05:00:46,878 --> 05:00:54,350
do to stop it. So I stare at her and wait
and live a lifetime in these last remaining

3241
05:00:54,350 --> 05:00:56,360
moments.

3242
05:00:56,360 --> 05:00:58,360
Nothing.

3243
05:00:58,360 --> 05:01:02,290
The clock ticks.

3244
05:01:02,290 --> 05:01:03,860
Nothing.

3245
05:01:03,860 --> 05:01:11,330
I take her in my arms and we hold each other.
Nothing.

3246
05:01:11,330 --> 05:01:17,928
I feel her tremble and I whisper in her ear.
Nothing.

3247
05:01:17,928 --> 05:01:23,470
I tell her for the last time this evening
that I love her.

3248
05:01:23,470 --> 05:01:27,760
And the thief comes.

3249
05:01:27,760 --> 05:01:33,830
It always amazes me how quickly it happens.
Even now, after all this time. For as she

3250
05:01:33,830 --> 05:01:40,570
holds me, she begins to blink rapidly and
shake her head. Then, turning toward the corner

3251
05:01:40,570 --> 05:01:46,190
of the room, she stares for a long time, concern
etched on her face.

3252
05:01:46,190 --> 05:01:53,180
No! my mind screams. Not yet! Not now ...not
when we’re so close! Not tonight! Any night

3253
05:01:53,180 --> 05:01:59,340
but tonight. . . . Please! The words are inside
me. I can’t take it again! It isn’t fair

3254
05:01:59,340 --> 05:02:01,090
. . . it isn’t fair....

3255
05:02:01,090 --> 05:02:05,680
But once again, it is to no avail.

3256
05:02:05,680 --> 05:02:16,070
“Those people,” she finally says, pointing,
“are staring at me. Please make them stop.”

3257
05:02:16,070 --> 05:02:17,100
The gnomes.

3258
05:02:17,100 --> 05:02:25,820
A pit rises in my stomach, hard and full.
My breathing stops for a moment, then starts

3259
05:02:25,820 --> 05:02:33,010
again, this time shallower. My mouth goes
dry, and I feel my heart pounding. It is over,

3260
05:02:33,010 --> 05:02:41,830
I know, and I am right. The sundowning has
come. This, the evening confusion associated

3261
05:02:41,830 --> 05:02:47,870
with Alzheimer’s disease that affects my
wife, is the hardest part of all. For when

3262
05:02:47,870 --> 05:02:56,218
it comes, she is gone, and sometimes I wonder
whether she and I will ever love again.

3263
05:02:56,218 --> 05:03:02,500
“There’s no one there, Allie,” I say,
trying to fend off the inevitable. She doesn’t

3264
05:03:02,500 --> 05:03:03,500
believe me.

3265
05:03:03,500 --> 05:03:05,040
“They’re staring at me.”

3266
05:03:05,040 --> 05:03:07,980
“No,” I whisper while shaking my head.

3267
05:03:07,980 --> 05:03:10,040
“You can’t see them?”

3268
05:03:10,040 --> 05:03:13,890
“No,” I say, and she thinks for a moment.

3269
05:03:13,890 --> 05:03:19,100
“Well, they’re right there,” she says,
pushing me away, “and they’re staring

3270
05:03:19,100 --> 05:03:21,308
at me.”

3271
05:03:21,308 --> 05:03:28,298
With that, she begins to talk to herself,
and moments later, when I try to comfort her,

3272
05:03:28,298 --> 05:03:30,590
she flinches with wide eyes.

3273
05:03:30,590 --> 05:03:36,680
“Who are you?” she cries with panic in
her voice, her face becoming whiter. “What

3274
05:03:36,680 --> 05:03:42,510
are you doing here?” There is fear growing
inside her, and I hurt, for there is nothing

3275
05:03:42,510 --> 05:03:48,680
I can do. She moves farther from me, backing
away, her hands in a defensive position, and

3276
05:03:48,680 --> 05:03:52,058
then she says the most heartbreaking words
of all.

3277
05:03:52,058 --> 05:03:58,660
“Go away! Stay away from me!” she screams.
She is pushing the gnomes away from her, terrified,

3278
05:03:58,660 --> 05:04:01,638
now oblivious of my presence.

3279
05:04:01,638 --> 05:04:07,888
I stand and cross the room to her bed. I am
weak now, my legs ache, and there is a strange

3280
05:04:07,888 --> 05:04:13,430
pain in my side. I don’t know where it comes
from. It is a struggle to press the button

3281
05:04:13,430 --> 05:04:19,370
to call the nurses, for my fingers are throbbing
and seem frozen together, but I finally succeed.

3282
05:04:19,370 --> 05:04:27,070
They will be here soon now, I know, and I
wait for them. While I wait, I stare at my

3283
05:04:27,070 --> 05:04:28,170
wife.

3284
05:04:28,170 --> 05:04:29,270
Ten...

3285
05:04:29,270 --> 05:04:30,270
Twenty . . .

3286
05:04:30,270 --> 05:04:36,560
Thirty seconds pass, and I continue to stare,
my eyes missing nothing, remembering the moments

3287
05:04:36,560 --> 05:04:44,388
we just shared together. But in all that time
she does not look back, and I am haunted by

3288
05:04:44,388 --> 05:04:48,830
the visions of her struggling with unseen
enemies.

3289
05:04:48,830 --> 05:04:57,580
I sit by the bedside with an aching back and
start to cry as I pick up the notebook. Allie

3290
05:04:57,580 --> 05:05:03,950
does not notice. I understand, for her mind
is gone.

3291
05:05:03,950 --> 05:05:09,650
A couple of pages fall to the floor, and I
bend over to pick them up. I am tired now,

3292
05:05:09,650 --> 05:05:16,690
so I sit, alone and apart from my wife. And
when the nurses come in they see two people

3293
05:05:16,690 --> 05:05:24,700
they must comfort. A woman shaking in fear
from demons in her mind, and the old man who

3294
05:05:24,700 --> 05:05:37,170
loves her more deeply than life itself, crying
softly in the corner, his face in his hands.

3295
05:05:37,170 --> 05:05:43,050
I spend the rest of the evening alone in my
room. My door is partially open and I see

3296
05:05:43,050 --> 05:05:48,900
people walk by, some strangers, some friends,
and if I concentrate, I can hear them talking

3297
05:05:48,900 --> 05:05:56,870
about families, jobs, and visits to parks.
Ordinary conversations, nothing more, but

3298
05:05:56,870 --> 05:06:04,770
I find that I envy them and the ease of their
communication. Another deadly sin, I know,

3299
05:06:04,770 --> 05:06:08,388
but sometimes I can’t help it.

3300
05:06:08,388 --> 05:06:13,860
Dr. Barnwell is here, too, speaking with one
of the nurses, and I wonder who is ill enough

3301
05:06:13,860 --> 05:06:20,138
to warrant such a visit at this hour. He works
too much, I tell him. Spend the time with

3302
05:06:20,138 --> 05:06:25,950
your family, I say, they won’t be around
forever. But he doesn’t listen to me. He

3303
05:06:25,950 --> 05:06:30,850
cares for his patients, he says, and must
come here when called. He says he has no choice,

3304
05:06:30,850 --> 05:06:37,780
but this makes him a man torn by contradiction.
He wants to be a doctor completely devoted

3305
05:06:37,780 --> 05:06:45,120
to his patients and a man completely devoted
to his family. He cannot be both, for there

3306
05:06:45,120 --> 05:06:52,190
aren’t enough hours, but he has yet to learn
this. I wonder, as his voice fades into the

3307
05:06:52,190 --> 05:07:00,080
background, which he will choose or whether,
sadly, the choice will be made for him.

3308
05:07:00,080 --> 05:07:07,620
I sit by the window in an easy chair and I
think about today. It was happy and sad, wonderful

3309
05:07:07,620 --> 05:07:14,280
and heart-wrenching. My conflicting emotions
keep me silent for many hours. I did not read

3310
05:07:14,280 --> 05:07:22,320
to anyone this evening; I could not, for poetic
introspection would bring me to tears. In

3311
05:07:22,320 --> 05:07:29,230
time, the hallways become quiet except for
the footfalls of evening soldiers. At eleven

3312
05:07:29,230 --> 05:07:34,080
o’clock I hear the familiar sounds that
for some reason I expected. The footsteps

3313
05:07:34,080 --> 05:07:36,360
I know so well.

3314
05:07:36,360 --> 05:07:38,110
Dr. Barnwell peeks in.

3315
05:07:38,110 --> 05:07:43,280
“I noticed your light was on. Do you mind
if I come in?”

3316
05:07:43,280 --> 05:07:46,850
“No,” I say, shaking my head.

3317
05:07:46,850 --> 05:07:51,530
He comes in and looks around the room before
taking a seat a few feet from me.

3318
05:07:51,530 --> 05:07:58,770
“I hear,” he says, “you had a good day
with Allie.” He smiles. He is intrigued

3319
05:07:58,770 --> 05:08:06,180
by us and the relationship we have. I do not
know if his interest is entirely professional.

3320
05:08:06,180 --> 05:08:08,798
“I suppose so.”

3321
05:08:08,798 --> 05:08:17,340
He cocks his head at my answer and looks at
me. “You okay, Noah? You look a little down.”

3322
05:08:17,340 --> 05:08:21,280
“I’m fine. Just a little tired.”

3323
05:08:21,280 --> 05:08:24,070
“How was Allie today?”

3324
05:08:24,070 --> 05:08:33,650
“She was okay. We talked for almost four
hours.” “Four hours? Noah, that’s . . . incredible.”

3325
05:08:33,650 --> 05:08:40,293
I can only nod. He goes on, shaking his head.
“I’ve never seen anything like it, or

3326
05:08:40,293 --> 05:08:44,808
even heard about it. I guess that’s what
love is all about. You two were meant for

3327
05:08:44,808 --> 05:08:49,878
each other. She must love you very much. You
know that, don’t you?”

3328
05:08:49,878 --> 05:08:57,730
“I know,” I say, but I can’t say anything
more. “What’s really bothering you, Noah?

3329
05:08:57,730 --> 05:09:00,990
Did Allie say or do something that hurt your
feelings?”

3330
05:09:00,990 --> 05:09:08,690
“No. She was wonderful, actually. It’s
just that right now I feel . . . alone.”

3331
05:09:08,690 --> 05:09:10,388
“Alone?”

3332
05:09:10,388 --> 05:09:12,090
“Yes.”

3333
05:09:12,090 --> 05:09:15,490
“Nobody’s alone.”

3334
05:09:15,490 --> 05:09:23,910
“I’m alone,” I say as I look at my watch
and think of his family sleeping in a quiet

3335
05:09:23,910 --> 05:09:32,730
house, the place he should be, “and so are
you.”

3336
05:09:32,730 --> 05:09:39,920
The next few days passed without significance.
Allie was unable to recognize me at any time,

3337
05:09:39,920 --> 05:09:45,810
and I admit my attention waned now and then,
for most of my thoughts were of the day we

3338
05:09:45,810 --> 05:09:52,660
had just spent. Though the end always comes
too soon, there was nothing lost that day,

3339
05:09:52,660 --> 05:09:59,880
only gained, and I was happy to have received
this blessing once again.

3340
05:09:59,880 --> 05:10:04,260
By the following week, my life had pretty
much returned to normal. Or at least as normal

3341
05:10:04,260 --> 05:10:11,560
as my life can be. Reading to Allie, reading
to others, wandering the halls. Lying awake

3342
05:10:11,560 --> 05:10:17,950
at night and sitting by my heater in the morning.
I find a strange comfort in the predictability

3343
05:10:17,950 --> 05:10:19,310
of my life.

3344
05:10:19,310 --> 05:10:26,372
On a cool, foggy morning eight days after
she and I had spent our day together, I woke

3345
05:10:26,372 --> 05:10:32,170
early, as is my custom, and puttered around
my desk, alternately looking at photographs

3346
05:10:32,170 --> 05:10:39,361
and reading letters written many years before.
At least I tried to. I couldn’t concentrate

3347
05:10:39,361 --> 05:10:45,080
too well because I had a headache, so I put
them aside and went to sit in my chair by

3348
05:10:45,080 --> 05:10:51,800
the window to watch the sun come up. Allie
would be awake in a couple of hours, I knew,

3349
05:10:51,800 --> 05:10:58,650
and I wanted to be refreshed, for reading
all day would only make my head hurt more.

3350
05:10:58,650 --> 05:11:05,160
I closed my eyes for a few minutes while my
head alternately pounded and subsided. Then,

3351
05:11:05,160 --> 05:11:14,360
opening them, I watched my old friend, the
creek, roll by my window. Unlike Allie, I

3352
05:11:14,360 --> 05:11:19,969
had been given a room where I could see it,
and it has never failed to inspire me. It

3353
05:11:19,969 --> 05:11:26,770
is a contradiction—this creek—a hundred
thousand years old but renewed with each rainfall.

3354
05:11:26,770 --> 05:11:35,000
I talked to it that morning, whispered so
it could hear, “You are blessed, my friend,

3355
05:11:35,000 --> 05:11:44,940
and I am blessed, and together we meet the
coming days.” The ripples and waves circled

3356
05:11:44,940 --> 05:11:51,100
and twisted in agreement, the pale glow of
morning light reflecting the world we share.

3357
05:11:51,100 --> 05:12:02,280
The creek and I. Flowing, ebbing, receding.
It is life, I think, to watch the water. A

3358
05:12:02,280 --> 05:12:07,542
man can learn so many things.

3359
05:12:07,542 --> 05:12:13,931
It happened as I sat in the chair, just as
the sun first peeked over the horizon. My

3360
05:12:13,931 --> 05:12:22,470
hand, I noticed, started to tingle, something
it had never done before. I started to lift

3361
05:12:22,470 --> 05:12:27,820
it, but I was forced to stop when my head
pounded again, this time hard, almost as if

3362
05:12:27,820 --> 05:12:35,060
I had been hit in the head with a hammer.
I closed my eyes, then squeezed my lids tight.

3363
05:12:35,060 --> 05:12:41,140
My hand stopped tingling and began to go numb,
quickly, as if my nerves were suddenly severed

3364
05:12:41,140 --> 05:12:47,610
somewhere on my lower arm. My wrist locked
as a shooting pain rocked my head and seemed

3365
05:12:47,610 --> 05:12:54,400
to flow down my neck and into every cell of
my body, like a tidal wave, crushing and wasting

3366
05:12:54,400 --> 05:12:56,048
everything in its path.

3367
05:12:56,048 --> 05:13:03,770
I lost my sight, and I heard what sounded
like a train roaring inches from my head,

3368
05:13:03,770 --> 05:13:09,790
and I knew that I was having a stroke. The
pain coursed through my body like a lightning

3369
05:13:09,790 --> 05:13:16,410
bolt, and in my last remaining moments of
consciousness, I pictured Allie, lying in

3370
05:13:16,410 --> 05:13:22,080
her bed, waiting for the story I would never
read, lost and confused, completely and totally

3371
05:13:22,080 --> 05:13:25,500
unable to help herself. Just like me.

3372
05:13:25,500 --> 05:13:38,240
And as my eyes closed for the final time,
I thought to myself, Oh God, what have I done?

3373
05:13:38,240 --> 05:13:44,510
I was unconscious on and off for days, and
in those moments when I was awake, I found

3374
05:13:44,510 --> 05:13:50,960
myself hooked to machines, tubes up my nose
and down my throat and two bags of fluid hanging

3375
05:13:50,960 --> 05:13:57,770
near the bed. I could hear the faint hum of
machines, droning on and off, sometimes making

3376
05:13:57,770 --> 05:14:04,590
sounds I could not recognize. One machine,
beeping with my heart rate, was strangely

3377
05:14:04,590 --> 05:14:11,380
soothing, and I found myself lulled to never-land
time and time again.

3378
05:14:11,380 --> 05:14:16,160
The doctors were worried. I could see the
concern in their faces through squinted eyes

3379
05:14:16,160 --> 05:14:21,670
as they scanned the charts and adjusted the
machines. They whispered their thoughts, thinking

3380
05:14:21,670 --> 05:14:27,380
I couldn’t hear. “Strokes could be serious,”
they’d say, “especially for someone his

3381
05:14:27,380 --> 05:14:35,330
age, and the consequences could be severe.”
Grim faces would prelude their predictions—“loss

3382
05:14:35,330 --> 05:14:40,970
of speech, loss of movement, paralysis.”
Another chart notation, another beep of a

3383
05:14:40,970 --> 05:14:46,340
strange machine, and they’d leave, never
knowing I heard every word. I tried not to

3384
05:14:46,340 --> 05:14:50,968
think of these things afterward but instead
concentrated on Allie, bringing a picture

3385
05:14:50,968 --> 05:14:56,410
of her to my mind whenever I could. I did
my best to bring her life into mine, to make

3386
05:14:56,410 --> 05:15:04,540
us one again. I tried to feel her touch, hear
her voice, see her face, and when I did tears

3387
05:15:04,540 --> 05:15:10,090
would fill my eyes because I didn’t know
if I would be able to hold her again, to whisper

3388
05:15:10,090 --> 05:15:15,810
to her, to spend the day with her talking
and reading and walking. This was not how

3389
05:15:15,810 --> 05:15:22,440
I’d imagined, or hoped, it would end. I’d
always assumed I would go last. This wasn’t

3390
05:15:22,440 --> 05:15:25,470
how it was supposed to be.

3391
05:15:25,470 --> 05:15:30,000
I drifted in and out of consciousness for
days until another foggy morning when my promise

3392
05:15:30,000 --> 05:15:36,468
to Allie spurred my body once again. I opened
my eyes and saw a room full of flowers, and

3393
05:15:36,468 --> 05:15:42,160
their scent motivated me further. I looked
for the buzzer, struggled to press it, and

3394
05:15:42,160 --> 05:15:47,450
a nurse arrived thirty seconds later, followed
closely by Dr. Barnwell, who smiled almost

3395
05:15:47,450 --> 05:15:48,450
immediately.

3396
05:15:48,450 --> 05:15:54,360
“I’m thirsty,” I said with a raspy voice,
and Dr. Barnwell smiled broadly.

3397
05:15:54,360 --> 05:16:01,138
“Welcome back,” he said, “I knew you’d
make it.”

3398
05:16:01,138 --> 05:16:08,080
Two weeks later I am able to leave the hospital,
though I am only half a man now. If I were

3399
05:16:08,080 --> 05:16:12,400
a Cadillac, I would drive in circles, one
wheel turning, for the right side of my body

3400
05:16:12,400 --> 05:16:17,030
is weaker than the left. This, they tell me,
is good news, for the paralysis could have

3401
05:16:17,030 --> 05:16:23,190
been total. Sometimes, it seems, I am surrounded
by optimists.

3402
05:16:23,190 --> 05:16:29,718
The bad news is that my hands prevent me from
using either cane or wheelchair, so I must

3403
05:16:29,718 --> 05:16:36,420
now march to my own unique cadence to keep
upright. Not left-right-left as was common

3404
05:16:36,420 --> 05:16:43,380
in my youth, or even the shuffle-shuffle of
late, but rather slow-shuffle, slide-the-right,

3405
05:16:43,380 --> 05:16:51,750
slow-shuffle. I am an epic adventure now when
I travel the halls. It is slow going even

3406
05:16:51,750 --> 05:16:57,950
for me, this coming from a man who could barely
outpace a turtle two weeks ago.

3407
05:16:57,950 --> 05:17:04,491
It is late when I return, and when I reach
my room, I know I will not sleep. I breathe

3408
05:17:04,491 --> 05:17:10,380
deeply and smell the springtime fragrances
that filter through my room. The window has

3409
05:17:10,380 --> 05:17:16,580
been left open, and there is a slight chill
in the air. I find that I am invigorated by

3410
05:17:16,580 --> 05:17:22,790
the change in temperature. Evelyn, one of
the many nurses here who is one-third my age,

3411
05:17:22,790 --> 05:17:28,040
helps me to the chair that sits by the window
and begins to close it. I stop her, and though

3412
05:17:28,040 --> 05:17:34,920
her eyebrows rise, she accepts my decision.
I hear a drawer open, and a moment later a

3413
05:17:34,920 --> 05:17:42,570
sweater is draped over my shoulders. She adjusts
it as if I were a child, and when she is finished,

3414
05:17:42,570 --> 05:17:48,330
she puts her hand on my shoulder and pats
it gently. She says nothing as she does this,

3415
05:17:48,330 --> 05:17:56,140
and by her silence I know that she is staring
out the window. She does not move for a long

3416
05:17:56,140 --> 05:18:03,120
time, and I wonder what she is thinking, but
I do not ask. Eventually I hear her sigh.

3417
05:18:03,120 --> 05:18:08,958
She turns to leave, and as she does, she stops,
leans forward, and then kisses me on the cheek,

3418
05:18:08,958 --> 05:18:17,160
tenderly, the way my granddaughter does. I
am surprised by this, and she says quietly,

3419
05:18:17,160 --> 05:18:22,600
“It’s good to have you back. Allie’s
missed you and so have the rest of us. We

3420
05:18:22,600 --> 05:18:29,030
were all praying for you because it’s just
not the same around here when you’re gone.”

3421
05:18:29,030 --> 05:18:37,480
She smiles at me and touches my face before
she leaves. I say nothing. Later I hear her

3422
05:18:37,480 --> 05:18:43,638
walk by again, pushing a cart, talking to
another nurse, their voices hushed.

3423
05:18:43,638 --> 05:18:51,708
The stars are out tonight, and the world is
glowing an eerie blue. The crickets are singing,

3424
05:18:51,708 --> 05:18:58,510
and their sound drowns out everything else.
As I sit, I wonder if anyone outside can see

3425
05:18:58,510 --> 05:19:06,770
me, this prisoner of flesh. I search the trees,
the courtyard, the benches near the geese,

3426
05:19:06,770 --> 05:19:14,740
looking for signs of life, but there is nothing.
Even the creek is still. In the darkness it

3427
05:19:14,740 --> 05:19:21,628
looks like empty space, and I find that I’m
drawn to its mystery. I watch for hours, and

3428
05:19:21,628 --> 05:19:27,950
as I do, I see the reflection of clouds as
they begin to bounce off the water. A storm

3429
05:19:27,950 --> 05:19:35,980
is coming, and in time the sky will turn silver,
like dusk again.

3430
05:19:35,980 --> 05:19:43,128
Lightning cuts the wild sky, and I feel my
mind drift back. Who are we, Allie and I?

3431
05:19:43,128 --> 05:19:50,872
Are we ancient ivy on a cypress tree, tendrils
and branches intertwined so closely that we

3432
05:19:50,872 --> 05:19:58,942
would both die if we were forced apart? I
don’t know. Another bolt and the table beside

3433
05:19:58,942 --> 05:20:04,548
me is lit enough to see a picture of Allie,
the best one I have. I had it framed years

3434
05:20:04,548 --> 05:20:10,218
ago in the hope that the glass would make
it last forever. I reach for it and hold it

3435
05:20:10,218 --> 05:20:17,218
inches from my face. I stare at it for a long
time, I can’t help it. She was forty-one

3436
05:20:17,218 --> 05:20:22,820
when it was taken, and she had never been
more beautiful. There are so many things I

3437
05:20:22,820 --> 05:20:29,750
want to ask her, but I know the picture won’t
answer, so I put it aside.

3438
05:20:29,750 --> 05:20:38,400
Tonight, with Allie down the hall, I am alone.
I will always be alone. This I thought as

3439
05:20:38,400 --> 05:20:43,520
I lay in the hospital. This I’m sure of
as I look out the window and watch the storm

3440
05:20:43,520 --> 05:20:53,830
clouds appear. Despite myself I am saddened
by our plight, for I realize that the last

3441
05:20:53,830 --> 05:21:01,670
day we were together I never kissed her lips.
Perhaps I never will again. It is impossible

3442
05:21:01,670 --> 05:21:07,980
to tell with this disease. Why do I think
such things?

3443
05:21:07,980 --> 05:21:13,870
I finally stand and walk to my desk and turn
on the lamp. This takes more effort than I

3444
05:21:13,870 --> 05:21:19,058
think it will, and I am strained, so I do
not return to the window seat. I sit down

3445
05:21:19,058 --> 05:21:24,071
and spend a few minutes looking at the pictures
that sit on my desk. Family pictures, pictures

3446
05:21:24,071 --> 05:21:30,388
of children and vacations. Pictures of Allie
and me. I think back to the times we shared

3447
05:21:30,388 --> 05:21:36,650
together, alone or with family, and once again
I realize how ancient I am.

3448
05:21:36,650 --> 05:21:42,870
I open a drawer and find the flowers I’d
once given her long ago, old and faded and

3449
05:21:42,870 --> 05:21:49,458
tied together with ribbon. They, like me,
are dry and brittle and difficult to handle

3450
05:21:49,458 --> 05:21:55,790
without breaking. But she saved them. “I
don’t understand what you want with them,”

3451
05:21:55,790 --> 05:22:00,360
I would say, but she would just ignore me.
And sometimes in the evenings I would see

3452
05:22:00,360 --> 05:22:10,240
her holding them, almost reverently, as if
they offered the secret of life itself. Women.

3453
05:22:10,240 --> 05:22:16,468
Since this seems to be a night of memories,
I look for and find my wedding ring. It is

3454
05:22:16,468 --> 05:22:22,292
in the top drawer, wrapped in tissue. I cannot
wear it anymore because my knuckles are swollen

3455
05:22:22,292 --> 05:22:29,590
and my fingers lack for blood. I unwrap the
tissue and find it unchanged. It is powerful,

3456
05:22:29,590 --> 05:22:35,610
a symbol, a circle, and I know, I know, there
could never have been another. I knew it then,

3457
05:22:35,610 --> 05:22:42,888
and I know it now. And in that moment I whisper
aloud, “I am still yours, Allie, my queen,

3458
05:22:42,888 --> 05:22:50,480
my timeless beauty. You are, and always have
been, the best thing in my life.”

3459
05:22:50,480 --> 05:22:57,958
I wonder if she hears me when I say this,
and I wait for a sign. But there is nothing.

3460
05:22:57,958 --> 05:23:01,980
It is eleven-thirty and I look for the letter
she wrote me, the one I read when the mood

3461
05:23:01,980 --> 05:23:08,208
strikes me. I find it where I last left it.
I turn it over a couple of times before I

3462
05:23:08,208 --> 05:23:15,340
open it, and when I do my hands begin to tremble.
Finally I read:

3463
05:23:15,340 --> 05:23:19,310
Dear Noah,
I write this letter by candlelight as you

3464
05:23:19,310 --> 05:23:24,548
lie sleeping in the bedroom we have shared
since the day we were married. And though

3465
05:23:24,548 --> 05:23:31,888
I can’t hear the soft sounds of your slumber,
I know you are there, and soon I will be lying

3466
05:23:31,888 --> 05:23:38,070
next to you again as I always have. And I
will feel your warmth and your comfort, and

3467
05:23:38,070 --> 05:23:43,450
your breaths will slowly guide me to the place
where I dream of you and the wonderful man

3468
05:23:43,450 --> 05:23:48,702
you are.
I see the flame beside me and it reminds me

3469
05:23:48,702 --> 05:23:55,900
of another fire from decades ago, with me
in your soft clothes and you in your jeans.

3470
05:23:55,900 --> 05:24:01,760
I knew then we would always be together, even
though I wavered the following day. My heart

3471
05:24:01,760 --> 05:24:07,840
had been captured, roped by a southern poet,
and I knew inside that it had always been

3472
05:24:07,840 --> 05:24:15,020
yours. Who was I to question a love that rode
on shooting stars and roared like crashing

3473
05:24:15,020 --> 05:24:23,020
waves? For that is what it was between us
then and that is what it is today.

3474
05:24:23,020 --> 05:24:30,058
I remember coming back to you the next day,
the day my mother visited. I was so scared,

3475
05:24:30,058 --> 05:24:35,450
more scared than I had ever been because I
was sure you would never forgive me for leaving

3476
05:24:35,450 --> 05:24:41,452
you. I was shaking as I got out of the car,
but you took it all away with your smile and

3477
05:24:41,452 --> 05:24:47,820
the way you held your hand out to me. “How
’bout some coffee,” was all you said.

3478
05:24:47,820 --> 05:24:52,968
And you never brought it up again. In all
our years together.

3479
05:24:52,968 --> 05:24:58,131
Nor did you question me when I would leave
and walk alone the next few days. And when

3480
05:24:58,131 --> 05:25:03,058
I came in with tears in my eyes, you always
knew whether I needed you to hold me or to

3481
05:25:03,058 --> 05:25:11,450
just let me be. I don’t know how you knew,
but you did, and you made it easier for me.

3482
05:25:11,450 --> 05:25:17,730
Later when we went to the small chapel and
traded our rings and made our vows, I looked

3483
05:25:17,730 --> 05:25:23,490
in your eyes and knew I had made the right
decision. But more than that, I knew I was

3484
05:25:23,490 --> 05:25:28,000
foolish for ever
considering someone else. I have never wavered

3485
05:25:28,000 --> 05:25:33,360
since.
We had a wonderful life together, and I think

3486
05:25:33,360 --> 05:25:39,840
about it a lot now. I close my eyes sometimes
and see you with speckles of gray in your

3487
05:25:39,840 --> 05:25:44,702
hair, sitting on the porch and playing your
guitar while little ones play and clap to

3488
05:25:44,702 --> 05:25:50,770
the music you create. Your clothes are stained
from hours of work and you are tired, and

3489
05:25:50,770 --> 05:25:57,480
though I offer you time to relax, you smile
and say, “That’s what I am doing now.”

3490
05:25:57,480 --> 05:26:03,550
I find your love for our children very sensual
and exciting. “You’re a better father

3491
05:26:03,550 --> 05:26:09,601
than you know,” I tell you later, after
the children are sleeping. Soon after, we

3492
05:26:09,601 --> 05:26:16,388
peel off our clothes and kiss each other and
almost lose ourselves before we are able to

3493
05:26:16,388 --> 05:26:23,570
slip between the flannel sheets.
I love you for many things, especially your

3494
05:26:23,570 --> 05:26:29,501
passions, for they have always been those
things which are most beautiful in life. Love

3495
05:26:29,501 --> 05:26:37,530
and poetry and fatherhood and friendship and
beauty and nature. And I am glad you have

3496
05:26:37,530 --> 05:26:42,270
taught the children these things, for I know
their lives are better for it. They tell me

3497
05:26:42,270 --> 05:26:47,050
how special you are to them, and every time
they do, it makes me feel like the luckiest

3498
05:26:47,050 --> 05:26:52,370
woman alive.
You have taught me as well, and inspired me,

3499
05:26:52,370 --> 05:26:57,968
and supported me in my painting, and you will
never know how much it has meant to me. My

3500
05:26:57,968 --> 05:27:03,208
works hang in museums and private collections
now, and though there have been times when

3501
05:27:03,208 --> 05:27:09,230
I was frazzled and distracted because of shows
and critics, you were always there with kind

3502
05:27:09,230 --> 05:27:17,800
words, encouraging me. You understood my need
for my own studio, my own space, and saw beyond

3503
05:27:17,800 --> 05:27:24,600
the paint on my clothes and in my hair and
sometimes on the furniture. I know it was

3504
05:27:24,600 --> 05:27:32,110
not easy. It takes a man to do that, Noah,
to live with something like that. And you

3505
05:27:32,110 --> 05:27:38,140
have. For forty-five years now. Wonderful
years.

3506
05:27:38,140 --> 05:27:44,780
You are my best friend as well as my lover,
and I do not know which side of you I enjoy

3507
05:27:44,780 --> 05:27:52,388
the most. I treasure each side, just as I
have treasured our life together. You have

3508
05:27:52,388 --> 05:28:00,058
something inside you, Noah, something beautiful
and strong. Kindness, that’s what I see

3509
05:28:00,058 --> 05:28:07,820
when I look at you now, that’s what everyone
sees. Kindness. You are the most forgiving

3510
05:28:07,820 --> 05:28:15,440
and peaceful man I know. God is with you,
He must be, for you are the closest thing

3511
05:28:15,440 --> 05:28:21,750
to an angel that I’ve ever met.
I know you thought me crazy for making us

3512
05:28:21,750 --> 05:28:28,110
write our story before we finally leave our
home, but I have my reasons and I thank you

3513
05:28:28,110 --> 05:28:35,660
for your patience. And though you asked, I
never told you why, but now I think it is

3514
05:28:35,660 --> 05:28:41,128
time you knew.
We have lived a lifetime most couples never

3515
05:28:41,128 --> 05:28:48,080
know, and yet, when I look at you, I am frightened
by the knowledge that all this will be ending

3516
05:28:48,080 --> 05:28:58,280
soon. For we both know my prognosis and
what it will mean to us. I see your tears

3517
05:28:58,280 --> 05:29:03,570
and I worry more about you than I do about
me, because I fear the pain I know you will

3518
05:29:03,570 --> 05:29:10,970
go through. There are no words to express
my sorrow for this, and I am at a loss for

3519
05:29:10,970 --> 05:29:17,640
words.
So I love you so deeply, so incredibly much,

3520
05:29:17,640 --> 05:29:24,780
that I will find a way to come back to you
despite my disease, I promise you that. And

3521
05:29:24,780 --> 05:29:32,000
this is where the story comes in. When I am
lost and lonely, read this story—just as

3522
05:29:32,000 --> 05:29:39,570
you told it to the children—and know that
in some way, I will realize it’s about us.

3523
05:29:39,570 --> 05:29:44,830
And perhaps, just perhaps, we will find a
way to be together again.

3524
05:29:44,830 --> 05:29:51,548
Please don’t be angry with me on days I
do not remember you, and we both know they

3525
05:29:51,548 --> 05:29:58,760
will come. Know that I love you, that I always
will, and that no matter what happens, know

3526
05:29:58,760 --> 05:30:05,220
I have led the greatest life possible. My
life with you.

3527
05:30:05,220 --> 05:30:10,850
And if you save this letter to read again,
then believe what I am writing for you now.

3528
05:30:10,850 --> 05:30:20,558
Noah, wherever you are and whenever this is,
I love you. I love you now as I write this,

3529
05:30:20,558 --> 05:30:30,180
and I love you now as you read this. And I
am so sorry if I am not able to tell you.

3530
05:30:30,180 --> 05:30:43,638
I love you deeply, my husband. You are, and
always have been, my dream.

3531
05:30:43,638 --> 05:30:51,110
Allie
When I am finished with the letter, I put

3532
05:30:51,110 --> 05:30:58,200
it aside. I rise from my desk and find my
slippers. They are near my bed, and I must

3533
05:30:58,200 --> 05:31:05,590
sit to put them on. Then, standing, I cross
the room and open my door. I peek down the

3534
05:31:05,590 --> 05:31:13,060
hall and see Janice seated at the main desk.
At least I think it is Janice. I must pass

3535
05:31:13,060 --> 05:31:19,510
this desk to get to Allie’s room, but at
this hour I am not supposed to leave my room,

3536
05:31:19,510 --> 05:31:24,950
and Janice has never been one to bend the
rules. Her husband is a lawyer.

3537
05:31:24,950 --> 05:31:31,200
I wait to see if she will leave, but she does
not seem to be moving, and I grow impatient.

3538
05:31:31,200 --> 05:31:39,050
I finally exit my room anyway, slow-shuffle,
slide-the-right, slow-shuffle. It takes aeons

3539
05:31:39,050 --> 05:31:45,860
to close the distance, but for some reason
she does not see me approaching. I am a silent

3540
05:31:45,860 --> 05:31:52,930
panther creeping through the jungle, I am
as invisible as baby pigeons.

3541
05:31:52,930 --> 05:31:58,058
In the end I am discovered, but I am not surprised.
I stand before her.

3542
05:31:58,058 --> 05:32:01,140
“Noah,” she says, “what are you doing?”

3543
05:32:01,140 --> 05:32:05,128
“I’m taking a walk,” I say. “I can’t
sleep.”

3544
05:32:05,128 --> 05:32:07,030
“You know you’re not supposed to do this.”

3545
05:32:07,030 --> 05:32:08,030
“I know.”

3546
05:32:08,030 --> 05:32:12,410
I don’t move, though. I am determined.

3547
05:32:12,410 --> 05:32:18,350
“You’re not really going for a walk, are
you? You’re going to see Allie.”

3548
05:32:18,350 --> 05:32:20,420
“Yes,” I answer.

3549
05:32:20,420 --> 05:32:24,610
“Noah, you know what happened the last time
you saw her at night.”

3550
05:32:24,610 --> 05:32:25,910
“I remember.”

3551
05:32:25,910 --> 05:32:28,440
“Then you know you shouldn’t be doing
this.”

3552
05:32:28,440 --> 05:32:35,790
I don’t answer directly. Instead I say,
“I miss her.” “I know you do, but I

3553
05:32:35,790 --> 05:32:37,240
can’t let you see her.”

3554
05:32:37,240 --> 05:32:44,150
“It’s our anniversary,” I say. This
is true. It is one year before gold. Forty-nine

3555
05:32:44,150 --> 05:32:45,600
years today.

3556
05:32:45,600 --> 05:32:47,202
“I see.”

3557
05:32:47,202 --> 05:32:50,320
“Then I can go?”

3558
05:32:50,320 --> 05:32:55,138
She looks away for a moment, and her voice
changes. Her voice is softer now, and I am

3559
05:32:55,138 --> 05:32:59,708
surprised. She has never struck me as the
sentimental type.

3560
05:32:59,708 --> 05:33:04,860
“Noah, I’ve worked here for five years
and I worked at another home before that.

3561
05:33:04,860 --> 05:33:10,310
I’ve seen hundreds of couples struggle with
grief and sadness, but I’ve never seen anyone

3562
05:33:10,310 --> 05:33:16,230
handle it like you do. No one around here,
not the doctors, not the nurses, has ever

3563
05:33:16,230 --> 05:33:18,990
seen anything like it.”

3564
05:33:18,990 --> 05:33:25,430
She pauses for just a moment, and strangely,
her eyes begin to fill with tears. She wipes

3565
05:33:25,430 --> 05:33:27,780
them with her finger and goes on:

3566
05:33:27,780 --> 05:33:33,440
“I try to think what it’s like for you,
how you keep going day after day, but I can’t

3567
05:33:33,440 --> 05:33:39,470
even imagine it. I don’t know how you do
it. You even beat her disease sometimes. Even

3568
05:33:39,470 --> 05:33:45,010
though the doctors don’t understand it,
we nurses do. It’s love, it’s as simple

3569
05:33:45,010 --> 05:33:49,260
as that. It’s the most incredible thing
I’ve ever seen.”

3570
05:33:49,260 --> 05:33:53,800
A lump has risen in my throat, and I am speechless.

3571
05:33:53,800 --> 05:34:01,558
“But Noah, you’re not supposed to do this,
and I can’t let you. So go back to your

3572
05:34:01,558 --> 05:34:09,090
room.” Then, smiling softly and sniffling
and shuffling some papers on the desk, she

3573
05:34:09,090 --> 05:34:15,410
says: “Me, I’m going downstairs for some
coffee. I won’t be back to check on you

3574
05:34:15,410 --> 05:34:23,870
for a while, so don’t do anything foolish.”

3575
05:34:23,870 --> 05:34:31,430
She rises quickly, touches my arm, and walks
toward the stairs. She doesn’t look back,

3576
05:34:31,430 --> 05:34:38,540
and suddenly I am alone. I don’t know what
to think. I look at where she had been sitting

3577
05:34:38,540 --> 05:34:45,030
and see her coffee, a full cup, still steaming,
and once again I learn that there are good

3578
05:34:45,030 --> 05:34:48,590
people in the world.

3579
05:34:48,590 --> 05:34:54,810
I am warm for the first time in years as I
begin my trek to Allie’s room. I take steps

3580
05:34:54,810 --> 05:35:01,690
the size of Pixie straws, and even at that
pace it is dangerous, for my legs have grown

3581
05:35:01,690 --> 05:35:10,350
tired already. I find I must touch the wall
to keep from falling down. Lights buzz overhead,

3582
05:35:10,350 --> 05:35:17,798
their fluorescent glow making my eyes ache,
and I squint a little. I walk by a dozen darkened

3583
05:35:17,798 --> 05:35:24,190
rooms, rooms where I have read before, and
I realize I miss the people inside. They are

3584
05:35:24,190 --> 05:35:32,490
my friends, whose faces I know so well, and
I will see them all tomorrow. But not tonight,

3585
05:35:32,490 --> 05:35:39,840
for there is no time to stop on this journey.
I press on, and the movement forces blood

3586
05:35:39,840 --> 05:35:46,700
through banished arteries. I feel myself becoming
stronger with every step. I hear a door open

3587
05:35:46,700 --> 05:35:53,600
behind me, but I don’t hear footsteps, and
I keep going. I am a stranger now. I cannot

3588
05:35:53,600 --> 05:35:59,350
be stopped. A phone rings in the nurses’
station, and I push forward so I will not

3589
05:35:59,350 --> 05:36:06,878
be caught. I am a midnight bandit, masked
and fleeing on horseback from sleepy desert

3590
05:36:06,878 --> 05:36:15,690
towns, charging into yellow moons with gold
dust in my saddlebags. I am young and strong

3591
05:36:15,690 --> 05:36:21,980
with passion in my heart, and I will break
down the door and lift her in my arms and

3592
05:36:21,980 --> 05:36:22,980
carry her to paradise.

3593
05:36:22,980 --> 05:36:25,940
Who am I kidding?

3594
05:36:25,940 --> 05:36:35,020
I lead a simple life now. I am foolish, an
old man in love, a dreamer who dreams of nothing

3595
05:36:35,020 --> 05:36:41,138
but reading to Allie and holding her whenever
I can. I am a sinner with many faults and

3596
05:36:41,138 --> 05:36:48,570
a man who believes in magic, but I am too
old to change and too old to care.

3597
05:36:48,570 --> 05:36:54,580
When I finally reach her room my body is weak.
My legs wobble, my eyes are blurred, and my

3598
05:36:54,580 --> 05:36:59,760
heart is beating funny inside my chest. I
struggle with the knob, and in the end it

3599
05:36:59,760 --> 05:37:05,760
takes two hands and three truckloads of effort.
The door opens and light from the hallway

3600
05:37:05,760 --> 05:37:11,750
spills in, illuminating the bed where she
sleeps. I think, as I see her, I am nothing

3601
05:37:11,750 --> 05:37:16,760
but a passerby on a busy city street, forgotten
forever.

3602
05:37:16,760 --> 05:37:23,230
Her room is quiet, and she is lying with the
covers halfway up. After a moment I see her

3603
05:37:23,230 --> 05:37:30,360
roll to one side, and her noises bring back
memories of happier times. She looks small

3604
05:37:30,360 --> 05:37:37,420
in her bed, and as I watch her I know it is
over between us. The air is stale and I shiver.

3605
05:37:37,420 --> 05:37:41,128
This place has become our tomb.

3606
05:37:41,128 --> 05:37:47,010
I do not move, on this our anniversary, for
almost a minute, and I long to tell her how

3607
05:37:47,010 --> 05:37:52,920
I feel, but I stay quiet so I won’t wake
her. Besides, it is written on the slip of

3608
05:37:52,920 --> 05:37:57,042
paper that I will slide under her pillow.
It says:

3609
05:37:57,042 --> 05:38:03,840
Love, in these last and tender hours is sensitive
and very pure

3610
05:38:03,840 --> 05:38:11,510
Come morning light with soft-lit powers to
awaken love that’s ever sure.

3611
05:38:11,510 --> 05:38:17,330
I think I hear someone coming, so I enter
her room and close the door behind me. Blackness

3612
05:38:17,330 --> 05:38:24,888
descends and I cross her floor from memory
and reach the window. I open the curtains,

3613
05:38:24,888 --> 05:38:33,020
and the moon stares back, large and full,
the guardian of the evening. I turn to Allie

3614
05:38:33,020 --> 05:38:40,690
and dream a thousand dreams, and though I
know I should not, I sit on her bed while

3615
05:38:40,690 --> 05:38:49,480
I slip the note beneath her pillow. Then I
reach across and gently touch her face, soft

3616
05:38:49,480 --> 05:38:58,320
like powder. I stroke her hair, and my breath
is taken away. I feel wonder, I feel awe,

3617
05:38:58,320 --> 05:39:05,940
like a composer first discovering the works
of Mozart. She stirs and opens her eyes, squinting

3618
05:39:05,940 --> 05:39:12,350
softly, and I suddenly regret my foolishness,
for I know she will begin to cry and scream,

3619
05:39:12,350 --> 05:39:20,440
for this is what she always does. I am impulsive
and weak, this I know, but I feel an urge

3620
05:39:20,440 --> 05:39:26,740
to attempt the impossible and I lean toward
her, our faces drawing closer.

3621
05:39:26,740 --> 05:39:34,690
And when her lips meet mine, I feel a strange
tingling I have never felt before, in all

3622
05:39:34,690 --> 05:39:42,400
our years together, but I do not pull back.
And suddenly, a miracle, for I feel her mouth

3623
05:39:42,400 --> 05:39:51,600
open and I discover a forgotten paradise,
unchanged all this time, ageless like the

3624
05:39:51,600 --> 05:39:58,560
stars. I feel the warmth of her body, and
as our tongues meet, I allow myself to slip

3625
05:39:58,560 --> 05:40:06,810
away, as I had so many years ago. I close
my eyes and become a mighty ship in churning

3626
05:40:06,810 --> 05:40:14,850
waters, strong and fearless, and she is my
sails. I gently trace the outline of her cheek,

3627
05:40:14,850 --> 05:40:22,430
then take her hand in mine. I kiss her lips,
her cheeks, and listen as she takes a breath.

3628
05:40:22,430 --> 05:40:29,888
She murmurs softly, “Oh, Noah . . . I’ve
missed you.” Another miracle—the greatest

3629
05:40:29,888 --> 05:40:36,330
of all!—and there’s no way I can stop
the tears as we begin to slip toward heaven

3630
05:40:36,330 --> 05:40:42,790
itself. For at that moment, the world is full
of wonder as I feel her fingers reach for

3631
05:40:42,790 --> 05:40:53,920
the buttons on my shirt and slowly, ever so
slowly, she begins to undo them one by one.
