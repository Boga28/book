00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,960
CHAPTER ONE
A body

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,840
In January, they found the girl's body.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,260
They found it in Pine Crest.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:17,860
Pine Crest is a small town about 90 miles
from Denver, in the Rocky Mountains.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,390
In the past, it was famous for silver and
gold.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,580
But now it's a place where people go on vacation;
they ski there in the winter and walk in the

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,760
mountains in the summer.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,029
Movie stars have homes there.

9
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,320
It's beautiful and it's quiet when the snow
falls.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,790
And the snow falls a lot in the winter.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,770
Pine Crest isn't usually the kind of place
you find a dead body.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,899
Denver's the place for that, not Pine Crest.

13
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:53,190
Oh, of course sometimes there are skiing accidents,
like in all ski resorts.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,410
I remember that a young man died about three
years ago.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,340
He was skiing too fast and he went into a
tree.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,850
It's sad, but it happens.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,889
But murder - killing someone - well, that's
different.

18
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:18,539
So that January morning my boss, Leo Cohn,
Chief of the Denver Police, called me into

19
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,869
his office.

20
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:25,369
'Girl's body in Pine Crest, Flick,' said Leo.

21
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,819
Leo was thin and worked too much.

22
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,380
He never sat down.

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,390
Now, he was standing near his desk.

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,619
'They found her yesterday.'

25
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,700
'Oh?'

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,209
I said.

27
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:41,849
'It looks like someone killed her,' he said.

28
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,490
I didn't say anything.

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,509
'Murder,' he said, as if I didn't understand.

30
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,990
I waited.

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,810
He didn't look at me.

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,439
Then he said, 'I want you to go to Pine Crest.'

33
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,700
'Ha!'

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,739
I said.

35
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,819
'So that's what you want.

36
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,979
But Leo, why me?

37
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,259
It's too soon.

38
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,090
It was just two months ago...

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,090
I can't!'

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,670
'Flick, you're the best,' he said, 'and you
need to get out of Denver...

41
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,530
it's the best thing.'

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,430
'Listen, Leo...'

43
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,030
I started, but I stopped.

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,390
Leo looked me in the eyes.

45
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,920
'Come on, Flick.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,390
Bill Gershon, the Chief of Police there, is
an old friend of mine.

47
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,860
He's not happy.

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,170
If it's murder, it's bad for business.

49
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,250
No-one wants to ski when there's a killer
about.'

50
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:46,590
Well, yeah, I thought, as I looked out of
Leo's window at the city, a dead body was

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,010
bad for business.

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,760
I knew Pine Crest.

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,390
I used to go skiing there on the weekends.

54
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,930
The town made its money from the thousands
of visitors who went there every year.

55
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,400
The restaurants, cafes, hotels, ski school,
all made money from the people who went to

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,070
beautiful Pine Crest for their vacation.

57
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,260
'And the girl?'

58
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
I asked.

59
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,160
'Was she a visitor?'

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,670
Leo smiled.

61
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,360
He could see that I was interested.

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
'Yes,' he said.

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,500
'She was there on a skiing vacation with some
friends from college.

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,460
Someone found her in the swimming pool at
the hotel where she was staying.'

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,570
'She died in the swimming pool?'

66
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,790
I asked.

67
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,950
'I mean...'

68
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,210
'Looks like somebody drowned her,' Leo said.

69
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,710
I looked at him.

70
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:52,270
'She was twenty-three years old,' Leo said
softly.

71
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,300
'And?'

72
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,209
I asked.

73
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,180
'You'll get what you need from Gershon,' said
Leo.

74
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,069
I got up to leave.

75
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,830
'Oh, and Flick...' said Leo.

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,470
I turned at the door.

77
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:13,680
'I want you to get this one and I want you
to get it fast,' he said.

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,709
'First because it'll make the Denver Police
Department look good.

79
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,329
And we need that.'

80
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,889
'And second because you think it's good for
me to get out of the office and back to work?'

81
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,009
I said.

82
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,710
Leo didn't say anything, but it was true.

83
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,599
He was helping me in his way.

84
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:46,969
'OK, Leo,' I said, 'but remember, it was just
November, just two months ago... that Scott...'

85
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,669
'Yeah, yeah, I know.

86
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,919
But Flick, Scott's dead,' said Leo.

87
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,770
His voice was kind, but strong.

88
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,759
'And you've got to live.'

89
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,990
He turned away from me and looked out of the
window.

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,629
Leo was finished.

91
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:16,550
I walked to my office to get the things I
needed for a few days out of town: my notebook,

92
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,380
cell phone and car keys.

93
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,470
I thought about November, thought about Scott.

94
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,550
Detective Scott King of the Denver Police.

95
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,020
Then I took my gun and put it under my jacket.

96
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,960
I went downstairs to the parking lot.

97
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,610
Scott and I worked together for four years.

98
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:46,069
We were the best, the best the Denver Police
Department had.

99
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:52,050
We loved catching killers, robbers, all of
Denver's criminals.

100
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,069
But we were more than that, we were friends
too.

101
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,280
Scott was my best friend.

102
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:08,460
Then one stupid, cold day in November, Eddie
Lang killed Scott.

103
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,140
And I saw my best friend die.

104
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:19,180
'Yeah,' I thought, 'Scott's dead and I've
got to live.'

105
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,810
Most days it was difficult.

106
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,400
I shook my head and Scott's face went away.

107
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,330
I took my keys out of the pocket of my jacket
and looked at the most beautiful car in the

108
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,249
world, my red 1957 Chevrolet.

109
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,539
My Chevy.

110
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,240
I smiled.

111
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,250
That car always made me smile.

112
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,990
Some days it felt like it was the only good
thing in my life.

113
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:57,029
I drove home fast to my apartment on Alameda,
went in and packed a bag.

114
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:03,249
I changed into my blue suit and looked at
myself in the mirror in the bathroom.

115
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,240
I looked OK.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,580
I looked like I came from the big city.

117
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,889
I felt my gun inside my jacket.

118
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,770
I was ready.

119
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,650
Ready to find a killer... without Scott.

120
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:25,369
Fifteen minutes later, I was driving on I70
to Pine Crest, Colorado.

121
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:28,119
I was trying to forget about Scott.

122
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:37,560
And I was trying to forget about Eddie Lang.

123
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,400
CHAPTER TWO
Pine Crest

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,780
Scott King.

125
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,699
Yeah, it was hard to forget.

126
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,360
As I drove up into the Rocky Mountains pictures
came into my head.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,669
The first time we worked together, his smile,
the things he said.

128
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,259
'Stop it, Flick!'

129
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,289
I said to myself.

130
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,990
I turned on the car radio.

131
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,770
It was an old country song.

132
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,659
Then the news came on.

133
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,360
'Good morning, listeners,' said the voice.

134
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,319
'It's ten o'clock and here's the news.

135
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,659
Police found a young woman's body in a swimming
pool at the Mountain Hotel in Pine Crest yesterday.

136
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:32,460
The twenty-three-year-old was a visitor from
Texas, in the town on a skiing vacation.

137
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,350
Police believe it was murder.'

138
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,750
I turned the radio off.

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,340
Scott came back to me.

140
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,000
I thought about the first time we worked together.

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,440
'Flick?' said Scott.

142
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,140
'That's a funny name.'

143
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,630
We were in a police car in downtown Denver.

144
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,420
'Well, my real name's Felicity,' I said.

145
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,930
'My dad liked it.

146
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,790
There was an English movie star called Felicity.

147
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,030
At school everyone thought it was very funny,
so I became Flick.'

148
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,810
'Flick Laine,' he said.

149
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,740
'Yeah, good, don't you think?'

150
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,530
I said.

151
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,210
'Yeah, Scott and Flick,' he laughed.

152
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,130
'Denver's crime fighters!'

153
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,830
'Hey, don't you mean Flick and Scott?'

154
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,060
I laughed.

155
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,350
Scott and Flick, Flick and Scott.

156
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,740
Now I looked at the road.

157
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,330
I tried to think about the drive.

158
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,170
The road was at 7,000 feet already.

159
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,970
But it was a beautiful day in the Rockies.

160
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,820
Really beautiful.

161
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,970
The sky was clear blue and you could see for
miles.

162
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,550
But I couldn't stop thinking about Scott.

163
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,560
I thought about the day he died, in November,
just two months ago.

164
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,750
The day we went looking for Eddie Lang, one
of Denver's worst criminals.

165
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,840
He killed people for money.

166
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,880
But we were on to him.

167
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,010
We knew where he was.

168
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,350
We were in an old, dark house.

169
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,700
We knew that Eddie Lang and his men were there.

170
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,770
'Don't worry, Scott, I'm behind you,' I said
quietly.

171
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,830
I could see Scott in front of me.

172
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,320
It was dark, but I could just see him.

173
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,010
Suddenly I heard a loud noise.

174
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,940
A gun.

175
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,790
Then Scott was down on the dirty floor.

176
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,980
His blood was everywhere.

177
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,640
I ran outside quickly and called the police
station.

178
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,480
A few minutes later, more police officers
arrived.

179
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,010
But Scott was dead.

180
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:15,860
Scott was dead and Eddie Lang and his men
were gone.

181
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,740
They were gone, but I thought about Scott
every day.

182
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,360
I went on driving.

183
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,250
An hour later, I drove into the parking lot
of Pine Crest police station.

184
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,820
Something told me that Bill Gershon, Chief
of Pine Crest Police, wasn't happy to see

185
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,200
me.

186
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,600
'So,' he said, as I walked into his office,
'Leo sent me a woman...'

187
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,490
'Yeah, aren't you lucky?'

188
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,980
I said, smiling.

189
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,340
Gershon didn't smile.

190
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,700
I sat down.

191
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,510
There were still men in the police who thought
that women police officers and murder didn't

192
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,250
go together.

193
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,720
It looked like Gershon was one of those men.

194
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,260
'We don't often have murders in Pine Crest,'
he said.

195
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,280
I looked at Gershon.

196
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:23,360
He was a round person: round body, round face,
round glasses.

197
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,290
About fifty, fifty-five maybe, with almost
no hair.

198
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,170
Then I looked around at his office.

199
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,980
Yeah, I thought, parking tickets, not murder.

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,220
'Listen,' I said.

201
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,780
'Why don't we make this easy?

202
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,720
Just tell me what I need to know.'

203
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,030
The Chief of Police said nothing for a moment
or two, and then went on.

204
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,540
'Janine Anderson was her name.

205
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,950
A student from Austin, Texas.

206
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,840
She wanted to write for a newspaper - to be
a journalist.

207
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,810
This is about her.'

208
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,050
He pushed some papers towards me.

209
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,550
I looked at the papers.

210
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,140
There wasn't much.

211
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,320
Her name, her parents' names.

212
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,250
A student of journalism at the University
of Texas, Austin.

213
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,090
Cause of death: drowning.

214
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,750
'Her parents were in Europe on vacation.'

215
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,780
Gershon shook his head sadly and said: 'They're
coming back today.

216
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,520
Coffee?'

217
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,980
It wasn't much, but it was a start.

218
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,020
'Who found her?'

219
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,910
I asked, drinking the hot black coffee.

220
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,750
'Her friend, Teresa Douglas,' said Gershon.

221
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,970
'They were staying at the Mountain Hotel.'

222
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,370
The Mountain Hotel was in Pine Crest.

223
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,720
A lot of skiers stayed there.

224
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,610
'They skied all day,' Gershon went on.

225
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,270
'Janine went to the swimming pool at about
nine o'clock.

226
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,240
The pool is on the top floor of the hotel.

227
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,040
She had to go upstairs and go outside.

228
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,930
At eleven o'clock, the Douglas girl went up
to look for Janine.

229
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,520
She found her in the swimming pool.'

230
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,720
'Dead?'

231
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
I asked.

232
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,490
'Yes,' said Gershon.

233
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,950
'Teresa Douglas tried mouth-to-mouth.

234
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:46,410
Then we had a 9-1-1 call at about eleven-fifteen.

235
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,590
We were there five minutes later.

236
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,190
Janine was dead.'

237
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,310
'Did Janine have other friends here?'

238
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,010
I asked.

239
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,530
'Yes.

240
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:04,690
Apart from the Douglas girl, there's a guy
- Jeff Mason,' said the Chief of Police.

241
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,790
'They're students in Austin.'

242
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,100
'Anything on the body?'

243
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,550
I asked.

244
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,090
I wanted to know if there was a fight before
Janine died.

245
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,800
'On the back of her neck,' said Gershon.

246
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,540
'It looks like maybe somebody just put her
head under the water and drowned her.'

247
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,470
'Well, we don't know that yet,' I said.

248
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,470
'This is terrible!' said Gershon.

249
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,150
'Governor Johnson is visiting Pine Crest soon.

250
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,670
A murder is the last thing we need!'

251
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:50,630
Clark Johnson was the Governor of Colorado
and everyone said he was the next President

252
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,750
of the United States.

253
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,180
He lived near Pine Crest.

254
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,730
I looked at Gershon.

255
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,960
He wasn't thinking about the dead girl.

256
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,970
He was thinking about the bad news, I thought.

257
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,170
I finished my coffee and stood up.

258
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,840
'OK, I'm going,' I said.

259
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,220
'Here's my cell phone number.'

260
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,310
I wrote down my number and gave it to Gershon.

261
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,760
'I'm staying at the Pine Lodge Hotel.'

262
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,770
Gershon came to the door with me.

263
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,340
He still didn't smile.

264
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,750
'Listen,' I said.

265
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,750
'Maybe you don't like it, but we have to work
together.

266
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:49,500
If this is murder, we have to find this killer
before he, or she, kills again.'

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,360
I looked at Gershon and walked away.

268
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:03,190
Great, I thought, just what I need - a Chief
of Police who doesn't want to work with me.

269
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,250
I went back to my car, took out my winter
coat and put it on.

270
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,770
It was cold here, much colder than Denver.

271
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,850
We were at 9,000 feet.

272
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:23,939
But it was a beautiful, clear day and there
was a smell of wood smoke in the air.

273
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,180
I walked down the road to the Mountain Hotel.

274
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,820
I looked at the town.

275
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,350
It was a pretty place.

276
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:40,650
Behind the small houses were the big houses
of the famous people who lived in Pine Crest.

277
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,980
Lots of movie stars and famous sports people
had homes there.

278
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,970
Sometimes you saw them on the ski runs, in
the stores or in the more expensive restaurants

279
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,120
in the town.

280
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,750
I looked up to the snow-covered mountains.

281
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:05,620
I could see ski runs everywhere, but there
were only a few people moving down the mountain.

282
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,560
It was a beautiful day for skiing, cold and
clear.

283
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,230
But no one wanted to ski.

284
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:23,000
They thought that there was a killer free
in the town.

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,180
CHAPTER THREE
The Mountain Hotel

286
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,050
Then I saw the Mountain Hotel.

287
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,630
I walked into the hotel and looked over to
the bar.

288
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,470
There was a fire; it was warm and comfortable.

289
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,690
It looked nice, I thought.

290
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:50,160
Janine Anderson's friends, Teresa Douglas
and Jeff Mason, were in Room 203.

291
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,780
They were about twenty-two, twenty-three years
old.

292
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,130
They looked young, lost.

293
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,860
'It's terrible,' said Teresa.

294
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,000
Her face was wet.

295
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,680
She cried softly.

296
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,170
Jeff sat down next to her on the bed and put
his hand on her shoulder.

297
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,610
I looked around at the room.

298
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,730
It was Jeff's room.

299
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:24,620
From the window, you could see a very high
mountain, the one they called Snowpeak.

300
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,100
There were clothes everywhere, ski boots under
the window.

301
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,160
'We can't believe she's dead, ma'am.

302
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,480
It's terrible,' said Jeff.

303
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,120
When he spoke, I could hear that he came from
Texas.

304
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,410
He was a tall, blond young man, good-looking.

305
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,520
'I understand,' I said.

306
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,190
'I'll try to be quick, but I have to ask some
questions.'

307
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,470
'Sure,' said Jeff.

308
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:04,420
'It was eleven o'clock,' Teresa said, 'when
I went to look for Janine.'

309
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,809
Teresa looked up at me.

310
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,010
She had dark hair and very white skin.

311
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,429
'You slept in the same room, you and Janine?'

312
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:15,770
I asked.

313
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:26,900
'Yes,' she answered, 'me and Janine in one
room, Room 309, and Jeff in this room.'

314
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,790
I looked at the girl.

315
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,570
I gave her time to tell her story.

316
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,990
'Janine went to the swimming pool at about
nine o'clock.

317
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,610
I fell asleep at about ten-thirty.

318
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,120
I was very tired; we skied the whole day.

319
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,860
But I woke up just before eleven o'clock and
saw that Janine wasn't there.

320
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,610
In her bed, I mean.

321
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,110
So I got dressed and went up to the top floor.

322
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,170
It was really cold outside.

323
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,860
I saw her in the swimming pool.

324
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,770
Just on top of the water.'

325
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,720
The girl put her head in her hands.

326
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,480
'I can't stop thinking about it,' she said.

327
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,410
She was quiet for a moment.

328
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,510
'I jumped into the pool,' she went on.

329
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:32,120
'I tried to pull her out of the water, but
she was too heavy.

330
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,630
I turned her over and put my mouth to hers,
but it was no good.

331
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,040
I knew it was no good.'

332
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,510
Teresa put her head in her hands again and
cried.

333
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,770
'And there was no-one else around?'

334
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,830
I asked after a few minutes.

335
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,900
'I couldn't see anyone,' she said.

336
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,900
'I shouted out and a hotel worker heard me.

337
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,590
He called the police.'

338
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,120
'And was Janine a good swimmer?'

339
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I asked.

340
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,710
'Oh yes, ma'am,' said Jeff.

341
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,480
'She was a great swimmer.

342
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm sure that Janine didn't drown by herself.'

343
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,440
'And how long have you been here?'

344
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,860
I asked.

345
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,580
'Almost ten days,' said Jeff.

346
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,490
'We have to leave tomorrow.

347
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,059
Classes start next week.'

348
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,100
'And do you want to write for a newspaper,
like Janine?'

349
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I asked.

350
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,200
'Yes, I do.

351
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,460
I study journalism,' said Jeff.

352
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,370
His face went white.

353
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,300
'Janine wanted so much to be a writer,' he
said.

354
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,770
'It was the thing she wanted most in the world.

355
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,780
And she was really good.'

356
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,429
'We know each other from the ski club,' said
Teresa.

357
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:06,570
'We all loved skiing.'

358
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,960
'Is this your first time here in Pine Crest?'

359
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,020
I asked.

360
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:21,010
'Mm, yes it is for us,' said Jeff, 'but Janine
knew it; she came here every year.

361
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,720
To ski, I mean.

362
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,640
She was the one...

363
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,230
She said it was a lovely place.

364
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,850
And it's true.

365
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,120
We were having a good time here.'

366
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,480
'Did Janine know anyone here in Pine Crest?'

367
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
I asked.

368
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,830
'I mean, did she see anyone while she was
here - a friend - anyone?'

369
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,610
Teresa shook her head.

370
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,610
'I don't know,' she said.

371
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,500
'I don't think so.

372
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,809
Just us, I think.'

373
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:01,990
'But she sometimes went off on her own - alone?'

374
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,150
I asked.

375
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,390
'Like the night she died?'

376
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,550
'Yes.

377
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:14,540
Janine always went to the pool alone in the
evenings,' said Teresa.

378
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,740
'But she didn't talk about anyone.

379
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,340
I don't think she knew anyone here.

380
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:27,880
I think she just thought, or wrote in her
notebook, and went swimming.'

381
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,890
'Notebook?'

382
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,080
I asked.

383
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,210
'Yes, Janine wrote in her notebook every day,'
said Teresa.

384
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:43,520
'She wrote about her day, about her thoughts,
her feelings, I think.

385
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,020
About things that happened to her, things
she saw.

386
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,929
Like Jeff said, she wanted to be a writer.

387
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,870
She liked to write.'

388
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,110
'And where's her notebook now?'

389
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,929
I asked.

390
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:06,360
'Well...' said Teresa, 'in our room, I think.

391
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,510
She always kept it next to her bed.

392
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,400
She liked to write when she woke up in the
morning.

393
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,570
You know her dreams and things.

394
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,450
Do you think it could be...

395
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,510
Shall I get it?'

396
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,460
'We can all go,' I said.

397
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,730
We all went upstairs to Room 309.

398
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,470
It was the same as Jeff's room, but with two
beds.

399
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,020
Teresa looked for the notebook.

400
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,310
'I can't find it,' she said.

401
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,010
'It isn't here!'

402
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,980
'It must be somewhere,' said Jeff.

403
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,470
'Shall we help you look?'

404
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,140
'Well, OK,' said Teresa, 'but it isn't here.

405
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,380
Really, it isn't.

406
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,950
She always kept it next to her bed!'

407
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,809
We looked everywhere in the room.

408
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,340
But Teresa was right.

409
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,700
Janine's notebook was gone.

410
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,410
Perhaps she took it with her to the swimming
pool last night?

411
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,150
I left the dead girl's friends with some questions
in my head.

412
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,790
Where was Janine Anderson's notebook?

413
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,320
Did Janine Anderson's killer take it?

414
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,850
And if so, why?

415
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,750
CHAPTER FOUR
A talk with Jeff

416
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,450
I went upstairs to the swimming pool where
Janine died.

417
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,710
From there you could see everything: the town
and the mountains.

418
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,049
Two of Gershon's men were there.

419
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:50,630
'Were you here last night?'

420
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,140
I asked the men.

421
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,690
'I was, Detective Laine,' said one of them,
a tall, big guy.

422
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,520
'The name's Williams.

423
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,679
Sergeant Bob Williams.'

424
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,560
'And did you find anything?'

425
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I asked.

426
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,070
'Just a pen,' said Williams.

427
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,590
'A pen?'

428
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,910
I said.

429
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,510
'Yes,' he said.

430
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,060
'I found a pen just here by the side of the
pool.

431
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,360
They're looking at it - to see if it was the
girl's.'

432
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,520
It looked like Janine Anderson really was
writing in her notebook last night, I thought.

433
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,940
The pen was there, but where was the notebook?

434
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,580
'OK.

435
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,100
And one more thing,' I said.

436
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,679
'Can you get to the swimming pool without
going through the hotel reception?'

437
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,600
'Yes,' said Williams.

438
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,930
'You can go through the parking lot, and the
place they keep the skis, then into the elevator.'

439
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,669
'And the elevator brings you here?'

440
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:59,750
I asked.

441
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,350
'That's right,' he said.

442
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,330
'No security cameras?'

443
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,710
I asked.

444
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,830
'No,' Williams said.

445
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,880
'I talked to the hotel manager and he told
me they never had any problems.'

446
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Until now, I thought, as I left the Mountain
Hotel.

447
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,970
I went outside into the street.

448
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,830
On a wall, there was an advertisement.

449
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,010
'Governor to run for White House,' it said.

450
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:38,820
There was a picture of Clark Johnson, the
Governor of Colorado.

451
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,559
The elections for President were later in
the year.

452
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,530
I looked back up to the top floor of the Mountain
Hotel.

453
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:53,020
I couldn't see the pool or Williams from here.

454
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,330
But maybe from higher up?

455
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:02,380
I looked across the street and saw a restaurant
called the Columbine.

456
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:08,510
You could sit outside at the top and I could
see people at the little tables.

457
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,320
I went in and walked up the stairs.

458
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,290
I showed the young waiter my police badge.

459
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,400
I looked over to the Mountain Hotel.

460
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,980
I could see Sergeant Williams next to the
pool.

461
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,160
What if...?

462
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,190
The killer could see Janine Anderson from
here!

463
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:36,510
He could sit here in the restaurant and wait,
then just walk into the hotel.

464
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:42,800
'Last night,' I said to the waiter, 'did you
see anything...

465
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,320
anyone strange?'

466
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,350
'Strange?'

467
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,299
The young man thought for a moment.

468
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:59,270
'Mmm,' he said, 'well, there was one man...
he's come here every night for the past ten

469
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,270
days.

470
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,500
A slim guy, about thirty-five, always alone.

471
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,980
Sits here for hours sometimes.'

472
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,230
'And last night?'

473
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,540
I asked.

474
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:20,679
'Last night,' the waiter answered, 'I thought
it was strange because the man asked for coffee

475
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,190
but he left before the coffee came.'

476
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,670
'He left without paying?'

477
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,760
I asked.

478
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,820
'No, no,' said the waiter, 'he paid.

479
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,470
He left some money on the table and just ran
out.'

480
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,669
'What time did he leave?'

481
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:40,770
I asked.

482
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:46,059
'Oh, I can't remember, I'm sorry,' said the
waiter.

483
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:51,200
'We were busy last night, but we close at
ten.'

484
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,559
'What time do the waiters leave?'

485
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,360
I asked.

486
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,550
'Oh, usually about ten-thirty,' he said.

487
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:08,130
So maybe the man just walked across the street,
through the parking lot and into the hotel

488
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,090
to kill Janine Anderson?

489
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:17,559
And no one could see him from the Columbine
because it was closed.

490
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:23,030
Was the man at the Columbine Janine Anderson's
killer?

491
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:28,290
I left the Columbine and walked back to the
police station.

492
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,380
I told Gershon about the man at the Columbine.

493
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,370
'Get Sergeant Williams on to it,' I said.

494
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,740
'We need to find that man.'

495
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,980
I got in my car and drove to my hotel.

496
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,220
The Pine Lodge Hotel was just half a mile
away from the Mountain Hotel.

497
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,490
I usually stayed at the Pine Lodge when I
came to Pine Crest for a skiing weekend.

498
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:01,100
It was a friendly place with nice, comfortable
rooms.

499
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,600
From the window of my room, I looked out over
the mountains.

500
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:15,100
Then I opened my small suitcase, lay on my
bed and thought about what I knew.

501
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,090
It was easy for the killer, I thought.

502
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,600
Easy to watch Janine from the terrace of the
Columbine.

503
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,760
Easy to get to the swimming pool.

504
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,080
But why?

505
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:33,549
I turned to the phone on the little table
by the side of the bed.

506
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:39,110
I called Leo and told him what I knew so far.

507
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,809
Leo listened.

508
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:45,460
Then he asked, 'How's Bill Gershon?'

509
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,290
'He's surprised I'm a woman,' I said.

510
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,549
'You didn't tell him...'

511
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,090
Leo laughed.

512
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,160
I laughed too.

513
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:02,700
We talked a little and then Leo said: 'Flick,
I have something to tell you.'

514
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,940
'Yes?'

515
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,990
I said.

516
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:11,850
'We found out something today about Eddie
Lang and Scott's murder,' said Leo.

517
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,880
I sat up quickly and shouted: 'Eddie Lang!

518
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,480
You mean you know we can get him?'

519
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,740
'Wait,' said Leo.

520
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,910
'Not exactly, but I think we're very near.'

521
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,280
'I'm coming back,' I said.

522
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,440
'I need to be there.'

523
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,500
'No,' said Leo.

524
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,309
'You stay right where you are.

525
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:36,730
We'll get Eddie Lang.

526
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,799
You get Janine Anderson's killer.'

527
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,950
I felt weak.

528
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,580
I said goodbye to Leo, put the phone down
and lay down again.

529
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:55,840
It was only three o'clock in the afternoon,
but I felt tired and closed my eyes.

530
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,610
Before I knew it, I was asleep.

531
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,550
I dreamed about Scott, like I often did.

532
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,240
I dreamed about his blood on the floor.

533
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,440
Then a noise woke me.

534
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,389
It was the phone.

535
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,760
'Hello,' I said.

536
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,169
My voice was heavy with sleep.

537
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:19,780
'Detective Laine?'

538
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,619
'Yes, who is it?'

539
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,599
I asked.

540
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,140
'It's Jeff Mason - Janine's friend,' said
the young man.

541
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,869
'I have to talk to you.'

542
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,940
'OK Jeff, sure,' I said.

543
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,849
'Come over.'

544
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,550
I got up and took a shower.

545
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:46,099
I tried to wake up, tried to forget Scott's
blood on the floor.

546
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:48,510
The redness of it.

547
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,179
I let the waterfall over my body.

548
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,770
It was warm and it felt good.

549
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,830
Scott was dead, but the water felt good.

550
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,010
Ten minutes later Jeff arrived.

551
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,440
I went down to Reception to see him.

552
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,500
We sat by the fire.

553
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,589
'What is it?'

554
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,540
I asked.

555
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,180
The young man looked at me.

556
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,190
'Well, maybe it's nothing, but...' he started.

557
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,760
I could see that he really wanted to talk.

558
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,310
'Well,' I said, 'it's best to tell me if you
think it's important.'

559
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,560
'It's about the notebook,' he said.

560
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,460
'The notebook?'

561
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
I asked.

562
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,500
'Do you have it?'

563
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,120
'No,' he said.

564
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,730
'No, it's just that...

565
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,520
Well, you know that Janine was studying to
be a journalist?'

566
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,170
'Yes, like you,' I said.

567
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,460
'Well, I was thinking...'

568
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
Jeff said.

569
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,610
'What is it?'

570
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,610
I asked.

571
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:09,400
'The thing is,' he said, 'every year at our
university we have a competition.'

572
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,210
'I don't understand,' I said.

573
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:19,520
'It's a competition for students of journalism,'
he told me, 'in February.

574
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,570
It's for the best story.

575
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,840
You know something new... something that no
one knows about.'

576
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,940
'And?'

577
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,820
I asked.

578
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:38,400
'So the winner - the one who writes the best
story - gets a big prize,' he said, 'and Janine

579
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,220
really wanted to win.'

580
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,870
'And she was good.'

581
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,180
I said.

582
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,420
'The best.'

583
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,650
Jeff smiled.

584
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,610
'And she was working on something really big,
I'm sure.'

585
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,620
'How do you know?'

586
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,160
I asked.

587
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,530
'Well, I just know she was,' he said.

588
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,980
'She was always writing in her notebook.

589
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,190
I could see she was.

590
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,190
It was something big.

591
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,110
And I'm sure it was something about Pine Crest!'

592
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,490
'Why do you think that?

593
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,940
About Pine Crest, I mean?'

594
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,500
I asked.

595
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,850
'Well, you know she came here every year?'

596
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,840
'Yes,' I said.

597
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,090
'I watched her,' said Jeff.

598
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,609
'Well, you know, we were friends.

599
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:39,119
And she went to the library at least two afternoons
in the last ten days, after skiing.

600
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,580
For books.

601
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,599
She was trying to put the story together.

602
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,990
I'm sure of it!'

603
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,850
I thought about what he said.

604
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,990
'But she didn't show it to you?'

605
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,990
I asked.

606
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,820
'Or talk to you about it?'

607
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,310
Jeff smiled.

608
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,590
'No!' he said.

609
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,870
'I'm in the competition too.

610
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,590
I don't know if it means anything... that
the notebook is gone.'

611
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:12,609
'Well,' I smiled at him, 'it's something.'

612
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:15,060
I looked out of the window.

613
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,020
The mountains were soft and quiet.

614
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,740
'Why didn't you say something before?'

615
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,330
I asked him.

616
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,700
'I didn't think.

617
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:32,420
I mean I didn't think it could have anything
to do with it,' said the young man.

618
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,830
'But maybe it does.

619
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,280
And now the notebook's gone.'

620
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,859
It was quiet for a moment.

621
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,630
Then Jeff spoke.

622
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:52,830
'You know, Detective Laine,' he said, looking
at me, 'it's really terrible to lose someone

623
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,320
close to you.

624
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,950
I can't tell you how I feel.

625
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,170
I feel terrible.'

626
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,970
'Yes,' I said.

627
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,310
'I know.'

628
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,530
I looked at Jeff.

629
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,760
He looked so young and so sad.

630
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,120
I don't know why, but I wanted to tell him
about Scott.

631
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,540
Perhaps it was because my dream was so close
to me.

632
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,630
Perhaps it was because Jeff had kind, blue
eyes.

633
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,990
Perhaps it was because Jeff's friend was dead
too.

634
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,160
I told him the story.

635
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,390
The story about Scott.

636
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:40,130
'We never caught him,' I said.

637
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,320
'Eddie Lang, I mean.

638
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,510
I never caught him.

639
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,390
I knew it was him.

640
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,370
I knew he killed Scott.

641
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,980
But...'

642
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,650
'But you didn't have anything...

643
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,990
you couldn't show that it was him,' said Jeff.

644
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,530
'I understand.

645
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,560
Yes, it's difficult.'

646
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,240
'Yeah,' I said, standing up.

647
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,300
'Most days it's difficult, and some days are
more difficult than others.'

648
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,840
'So...?'

649
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,500
Jeff asked.

650
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,810
'So how do I live?'

651
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,980
I asked the question for him.

652
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,900
'Well, some days I think why wasn't I there
in front?

653
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,960
Why didn't I die?

654
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:43,850
Then some days I think why didn't I stop Lang,
stop him from shooting Scott?'

655
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,830
Jeff looked at me.

656
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:53,570
'But most days,' I said, 'I think we're going
to get Eddie Lang!

657
00:40:53,570 --> 00:41:04,430
One day, Eddie Lang will be in prison for
a very long time!'

658
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,849
CHAPTER FIVE
Looking for reasons

659
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:17,930
That night at about nine-thirty Janine Anderson's
parents flew into Denver International Airport.

660
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,480
They were returning early from their holiday
in Italy.

661
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,150
A police car drove them to Pine Crest Hospital.

662
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,770
They had to see their daughter's body, to
see that it really was Janine.

663
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:39,001
The Andersons were staying at the Pine Lodge
too, and late in the evening, at about eleven

664
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:44,620
o'clock, Bill Gershon brought them to the
hotel.

665
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,970
'I'm so sorry,' I said to them.

666
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,370
'I'll try to make this quick.'

667
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:59,310
Gene and Loretta Anderson were both forty
to forty-five, well-dressed, rich Texans.

668
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,900
Janine's mother soon went to her room and
I talked to the father.

669
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:11,220
Gene Anderson was a Texas oilman, a man who
was now very rich, but who started life on

670
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,940
a farm, a ranch, near Houston.

671
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,610
'I just can't believe it,' he said again and
again.

672
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,810
'She was so young, so intelligent.

673
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,700
Who did this, Detective Laine?

674
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Who killed my baby?'

675
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,050
'I don't know, Mr. Anderson,' I said, 'but
I am going to find out.'

676
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,960
'I hope so, Detective Laine.

677
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,120
I really hope so.'

678
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,180
'But I need your help, Mr. Anderson,' I said.

679
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,010
'Anything I can do,' he said.

680
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,470
'Well, there is one thing,' I said.

681
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,300
'She was studying to become a journalist,
right?'

682
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,150
'That's right,' he said, 'and she was an "A"
student.'

683
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,440
He smiled for the first time.

684
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,839
'She was a really good writer,' he said.

685
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:18,750
'All her teachers said she could be a really
good journalist one day.'

686
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,580
Gene Anderson tried to stop himself from crying.

687
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,570
I waited for a few minutes.

688
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:36,260
'Mr. Anderson, Janine's friend Jeff told me
that she was writing something for a university

689
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,710
competition,' I said.

690
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:45,290
'Yes,' said the dead girl's father, 'and she
really wanted to win.

691
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,170
She wanted to be a journalist more than anything
in the world.

692
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,470
And she knew that it was a good start.

693
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:58,060
She told me something about it at Christmas.'

694
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,290
'Did she tell you what she was writing about?'

695
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,310
I asked.

696
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:11,869
'No, not really, ma'am,' said Gene Anderson,
'but I think it was something big.'

697
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:14,650
I looked at Gene Anderson.

698
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:22,940
He went on: '"Daddy," she told me, "this story's
so big it's going to get me the journalism

699
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:29,890
prize and maybe somebody will go to prison
for a very long time."'

700
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,480
'But she didn't tell you who the "somebody"
was?'

701
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,170
I asked him.

702
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,930
'No,' he said, 'she didn't.

703
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,780
She was working on it, you know, getting it
right.

704
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,160
Hey, you're not saying...?'

705
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,339
'I'm not saying anything, Mr. Anderson,' I
replied.

706
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:53,640
'Nothing at all.'

707
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:02,160
The next morning I got up early and went out.

708
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,320
It was very cold in the early morning.

709
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,770
The snow was hard and it was difficult to
stay on your feet.

710
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,110
I thought again, about what Gene Anderson
told me.

711
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:22,560
'Somebody will go to prison for a very long
time,' his daughter said to him.

712
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,570
Who was it?

713
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,020
What was Janine writing about?

714
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,599
I looked for Pine Crest Town Library, the
library where Janine Anderson went to study

715
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,880
for her story.

716
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,310
Then I saw a building with a big sign outside.

717
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:45,109
It said: 'Books can change your life.'

718
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,630
I went into the library.

719
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,560
The young woman at the desk had big hair and
a big smile.

720
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,410
'Good morning, can I help you?'

721
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,800
she said.

722
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,730
'Yes,' I said, and showed her my police badge.

723
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,950
'Detective Flick Laine, Denver Police Department.

724
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,890
It's about the death of Janine Anderson.'

725
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,530
She stopped smiling.

726
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:16,710
'Oh yes, poor girl...

727
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,020
it's terrible.'

728
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,730
'Did she ever come here?'

729
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,970
I asked.

730
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,590
'Yes, she did,' said the young woman.

731
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,670
'She mostly wanted to look at pages from old
newspapers.'

732
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,070
'She could take books and newspapers away?'

733
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,090
I asked.

734
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:41,690
'She had a letter from her university,' said
the young woman, 'so she could take newspapers

735
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,599
and books out.

736
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,960
She was a student, you know.'

737
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,940
'Yes,' I said.

738
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,800
'Do you have a list of the newspapers and
books she took?'

739
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,640
'Oh yes,' said the librarian.

740
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,990
'Would you like to see it?'

741
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,220
'Yes, please,' I said.

742
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,160
The young woman turned to the computer in
front of her.

743
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,230
'Here,' she said.

744
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,450
'Have a look.'

745
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,880
First, there was the dead girl's name and
home address in Texas.

746
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,890
Then there was a list of books; all of them
were about Colorado and land development.

747
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:28,060
Then there was a list of about ten newspapers
that Janine took from the library in the last

748
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,810
two years.

749
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,280
I asked to see them all.

750
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,510
In every newspaper, there was a story about
ski resorts and hotels.

751
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,080
One of them talked about a famous movie star.

752
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:49,640
The movie star, Susan Hunter, who lives in
Pine Crest, said: 'People have always come

753
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,950
to Colorado, to get rich fast.

754
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,410
In the past, it was gold and silver.

755
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,700
Today, most of the gold and silver has gone.

756
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:07,180
The new gold is land that can be used for
ski resorts and hotels.

757
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,339
Land developers make millions of dollars from
this land.

758
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:18,710
Today in Colorado, there's a fight between
big business and nature lovers who want to

759
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,190
stop this.

760
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,130
I am fighting for Colorado!'

761
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,990
I closed the newspaper.

762
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,570
Big business, I thought.

763
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,070
Big money.

764
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:40,329
Every year in Colorado, there were more houses,
more stores, and more ski resorts.

765
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:44,420
More and more people trying to make money.

766
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,770
I knew that people who lived here in the Rocky
Mountains often got angry.

767
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,850
'This is nature,' they said.

768
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,730
'We don't need more buildings.

769
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,400
We don't need more ski resorts.'

770
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:32,650
But it was like standing on the beach and
trying to make the sea go back.

771
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,430
CHAPTER SIX
A Movie Star

772
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,090
I called Gershon on my cell phone.

773
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:43,109
'Susan Hunter,' I said.

774
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:48,579
'She seems to be very active in the fight
against land development.'

775
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:52,700
'Yeah, she was, he said.

776
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,820
'But she hasn't done anything for a while.'

777
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,510
'Where does she live?'

778
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,200
I asked.

779
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,930
'Big house up on Hillside,' he said.

780
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:08,420
Hillside was the part of Pine Crest where
all the famous people lived.

781
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,480
'Good,' I said.

782
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,589
'I'll go to see her.

783
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:15,950
Oh, and did you hear from the hospital?'

784
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,330
'Yes,' he said.

785
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,430
'And?'

786
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,619
I asked.

787
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:26,280
Working with Gershon was slow.

788
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:34,850
'Well, they are sure now that it was murder,'
he said, 'and it was a man.'

789
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,740
'What time did she die?'

790
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,869
I asked.

791
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,579
'Between ten-thirty and eleven,' he said.

792
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:50,870
Janine Anderson died minutes before Teresa
Douglas went to the pool and found her body.

793
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:55,930
And probably minutes after the waiters at
the Columbine left.

794
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:02,450
I put my phone away and felt my gun in my
inside pocket.

795
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:09,510
At three o'clock that afternoon, I parked
my Chevy next to Susan Hunter's Jaguar, outside

796
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,270
her beautiful big house.

797
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,010
Movie stars, I thought.

798
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,630
They don't like development, but they live
in big houses!

799
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:25,740
I got out of my car and looked at the mountains.

800
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,440
I saw that there were cameras everywhere around
the house.

801
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,760
A very tall man came to the door.

802
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,760
I could see that he had a gun under his jacket.

803
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,220
I showed him my City of Denver police badge.

804
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:47,300
'Good afternoon, Detective Laine,' he said,
smiling.

805
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,880
He took me into the star's living room.

806
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,170
A few moments later, she walked in.

807
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:01,900
Susan Hunter was a beautiful woman in her
thirties, with black hair and clear blue eyes.

808
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,260
She was dressed in grey trousers and a red
blouse with a high neck.

809
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:12,300
We sat together in the very big living room,
drinking tea.

810
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,849
Around the room, there were photos of the
star with other famous movie stars.

811
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:21,960
There were also photos of her husband and
three children.

812
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:29,951
'Yes, in the past it was gold and silver,
Detective Laine,' she said, taking a drink

813
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:31,880
of her tea.

814
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,540
'Now it's ski resorts.

815
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,490
There's always some reason why we need land.'

816
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,869
I waited for more.

817
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:45,940
'But,' she said, 'it can't go on like this.

818
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,300
The land is not ours.

819
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,050
It's for our children and our grandchildren
to enjoy.

820
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,460
This is such a beautiful place.'

821
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,369
'Yes, it's lovely,' I agreed.

822
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:01,770
We looked out of the window.

823
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:08,400
The sun was starting to go down over the Rocky
Mountains and the sky was pink and orange.

824
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,670
'But ski resorts mean big money,' she went
on, 'and it's difficult to stop people buying

825
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:18,570
and developing the land.'

826
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,099
Her voice became very quiet.

827
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:25,079
'Look at Redridge,' she said.

828
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,290
'Oh yes,' I said.

829
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,290
Redridge was a small town thirty miles away.

830
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,640
It was an old silver town.

831
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:42,490
'Well,' she said, 'three years ago Redridge
was a small, quiet town.

832
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:50,980
Now it's a very big resort with hotels, expensive
stores and restaurants, and ski runs everywhere.

833
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,160
It has thousands of visitors every year.'

834
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,160
'So?'

835
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,480
I asked.

836
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,170
'Isn't that good for the town?'

837
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,040
Susan Hunter laughed.

838
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,350
'Have you seen it?'

839
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,369
she asked.

840
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:07,900
'Tell me more,' I said.

841
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:14,760
'The Government Land Office,' she said, 'bought
the Redridge land fifty years ago.

842
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:21,900
Then, in 1997, they - the GLO - wanted to
sell the land.

843
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,150
They knew they could sell it as a vacation
resort and get a lot of money.'

844
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,839
I knew that this happened a lot.

845
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,760
The government was always trying to find ways
to make money.

846
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:41,640
Susan Hunter went on: 'So they asked vacation
resort companies to tell them about their

847
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,349
plans for the town.

848
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:49,200
There were five big companies that wanted
to develop Redridge.

849
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,100
The company that won was Alpine Resorts.

850
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,190
Their boss is a guy called Ricky Klein.'

851
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,190
'Ricky Klein?'

852
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,980
I asked.

853
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,970
'He's always in the newspapers,' she said.

854
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:08,690
'He's very rich and he has hundreds of businesses.

855
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:16,140
Alpine Resorts was already famous for Alpine
Resorts Oregon, which destroyed beautiful

856
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,570
natural forests.

857
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:23,750
Three of the other four companies all had
good plans for Redridge.

858
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:28,270
They wanted to save its natural beauty,' she
went on.

859
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:32,869
'So why did the GLO choose the worst plan?'

860
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:33,869
I asked.

861
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:34,869
'Ha!

862
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:40,950
That's the big question, Detective Laine,'
said Susan Hunter.

863
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:47,260
'I guess that Ricky Klein gave someone in
the GLO a lot of money.'

864
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,010
'Money?

865
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,310
A bribe?'

866
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,670
I asked.

867
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,589
Susan Hunter nodded.

868
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:57,480
'A bribe,' she said.

869
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,650
'Millions of dollars, I guess.'

870
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,220
'And why wasn't it in the newspapers?'

871
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,220
I asked.

872
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,369
'I mean, you knew about it... who else?'

873
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:15,890
'The GLO kept everything quiet until the last
minute,' she said.

874
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,310
'Then it was too late.

875
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,940
My group was called Save Colorado.

876
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,550
We knew about the bribe from someone who worked
for the GLO.

877
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,730
But we don't know who took the bribe.'

878
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,460
I looked at her.

879
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,810
'Did you know Janine Anderson?'

880
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:36,810
I asked.

881
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,950
'Yes, I did a little,' she said quietly.

882
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:45,810
'She came here to talk to me last year.

883
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,870
I told her what I knew.'

884
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:51,380
That's it, I thought.

885
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:57,180
Janine Anderson found out the name of the
person in the Government Land Office who took

886
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,830
the money.

887
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,630
It was quiet for a few moments.

888
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,550
'And what about Pine Crest?'

889
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,130
I asked.

890
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:14,720
'Well,' Susan Hunter said, 'the next Alpine
Resorts development will be in Pine Crest,

891
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,570
later this year.

892
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,950
What happened to Redridge will happen here.

893
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,750
They'll kill its natural beauty.'

894
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,950
She smiled sadly.

895
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,210
And no-one can save it.'

896
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,470
I stood up to go.

897
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,260
At the door, I turned round.

898
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:40,820
'There's one thing I don't understand,' I
said.

899
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,609
'You mean why don't I do something about this?

900
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:47,660
Why didn't I tell the police before now?'

901
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,540
she asked.

902
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,069
She pulled down the neck of her red blouse.

903
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:58,859
On her neck, very near her throat, there was
a big scar.

904
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,410
From a knife.

905
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:08,760
'Detective Laine, I have three children, a
wonderful husband and my work,' she said.

906
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,119
'I don't want to die.'

907
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:13,470
'What happened?'

908
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,700
I asked.

909
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,200
'It was a year ago.

910
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,550
Oh, I can't say who it was,' she said.

911
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:26,030
'It happened at night and I didn't see his
face.

912
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:29,540
But I'm sure it was because of all this.

913
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,990
These are dangerous days.

914
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,270
We must be very careful.'

915
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:39,590
Yeah, dangerous days, I thought.

916
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:49,400
I felt my gun under my jacket and left the
movie star's house.

917
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,859
CHAPTER SEVEN
A visit to Redridge

918
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:58,970
I drove away from Susan Hunter's house and
back to my hotel.

919
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,859
I thought about my talk with the movie star.

920
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:09,650
Ricky Klein of Alpine Resorts gave someone
in the Government Land Office a bribe to take

921
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,670
the worst plan for Redridge.

922
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,300
And Janine Anderson knew all about it.

923
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:20,890
But who was it, and how did Janine find out?

924
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,069
I went back to my room and called Gershon.

925
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:31,530
'Bill, I want a full list of people in the
Government Land Office since 1996.

926
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,340
Can you ask one of your men to get it for
me?'

927
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,930
'I guess so,' said Gershon.

928
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,640
Same old Gershon.

929
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,821
What was wrong with the guy?

930
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:46,010
The next morning I woke up early.

931
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:47,390
I picked up my gun.

932
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:54,700
I remembered Susan Hunter's question about
Redridge: 'Have you seen it?'

933
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,150
It was time to visit Redridge.

934
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,950
I wanted to see it for myself.

935
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:04,490
I got in the Chevy and drove the thirty miles
to the town.

936
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:11,780
'Welcome to Redridge, home of Alpine Resorts
Colorado' said the sign as I drove in.

937
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,369
The town was busy with people on vacation.

938
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:17,420
Skiers, mostly.

939
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,240
On Main Street, there were some stores and
restaurants.

940
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,820
Then, at the end of the street, I found the
beginning of Alpine Resorts Colorado.

941
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,780
At the gate was a man in a blue uniform.

942
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,490
'Good morning, how can I help you?' he asked.

943
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:39,300
He smiled and showed very white teeth.

944
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:46,950
'Well,' I said, 'I'm just visiting, you know,
and I'd like to take a look.'

945
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:50,030
'Of course,' he smiled.

946
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,290
'I'll ask someone to show you around.'

947
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,150
I waited.

948
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,010
He talked to someone on the phone.

949
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:02,589
A few minutes later, a young blonde woman
walked up to me.

950
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:04,670
She smiled a lot too.

951
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:09,961
'Good morning,' she said, shaking my hand.

952
01:01:09,961 --> 01:01:13,859
'My name is Tina Nielson from Alpine Resorts.

953
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:18,390
Let me show you around our beautiful resort.'

954
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,490
We started walking.

955
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:26,329
Alpine Resorts Colorado was almost like a
small city.

956
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:31,099
When you went through the big gate, there
were a lot of different buildings.

957
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:39,540
There were three swimming pools, four hotels,
vacation homes, restaurants and ski rental.

958
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,119
It was very, very big.

959
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:48,180
'We have the complete vacation here,' smiled
Tina.

960
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,349
'You can do everything.

961
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:53,990
You don't have to leave Alpine Resorts.'

962
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,250
I looked around.

963
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:01,250
Many of the buildings were so big that you
couldn't see the mountains.

964
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,320
'Yes,' she went on.

965
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,390
'It's a vacation for the whole family.

966
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,930
And the skiing is very good.

967
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,880
We have all the ski runs in Redridge right
here.'

968
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:20,910
'You mean,' I said, 'if I want to ski I have
to stay here?'

969
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:26,849
'Well,' she said, 'of course you can ski just
for the day.

970
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,840
But the ski runs are ours.

971
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,210
I mean Alpine Resorts'.'

972
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,370
'And how much is a ski pass?'

973
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,869
I asked.

974
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:39,910
'It's three hundred dollars a day,' she said.

975
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:41,920
Three hundred dollars!

976
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,319
That was double the cost of a ski pass in
Pine Crest.

977
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:53,069
Alpine Resorts was very expensive; someone
was making a lot of money!

978
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,130
'But why don't you try it?'

979
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,130
she said.

980
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:59,680
'Well, I'm a little busy...'

981
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,099
I started.

982
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:02,790
'Come on,' she said.

983
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:07,880
'We'll be happy to give you a half price ski
pass for the morning.

984
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,210
That will be just seventy-five dollars.'

985
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:14,950
'Well, OK,' I said.

986
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:18,431
I could ski for an hour or two, I thought.

987
01:03:18,431 --> 01:03:20,910
I needed some time to think.

988
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:26,590
I went to the ski rental, and got some skis,
boots and poles.

989
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:33,500
I went up the mountain on a ski lift and spent
an hour or two skiing the lower runs.

990
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,440
It was a beautiful day to be on the mountains.

991
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,609
But from the top I could see how big Alpine
Resorts really was.

992
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:49,849
At about eleven-thirty, I went into a cafe
halfway up the mountain.

993
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:53,050
There were a lot of other skiers there.

994
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:59,800
I drank my coffee, took my ski run map out
of my pocket and looked at it.

995
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:06,690
Up above the cafe there were some difficult,
'black' runs with interesting names like Mad

996
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,410
Dog and Killer Run.

997
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,460
I wanted to try them.

998
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,710
And I wanted to get away from the people.

999
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:17,340
I needed to think.

1000
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:22,480
I took the Mountain Tops ski lift up another
1,000 feet.

1001
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:29,440
Here, at 10,500 feet, the world was white
and quiet.

1002
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,609
It was very cold.

1003
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:37,849
There were almost no people, just a few figures
far away.

1004
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:41,059
Most skiers stayed down below.

1005
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:43,010
I felt alone.

1006
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:49,800
I put my hand in the pocket on the inside
of my coat and felt my gun.

1007
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:57,609
I wanted to go up even higher, to 12,000 feet,
almost to the top of the mountain.

1008
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:01,780
I started to walk slowly to the Summit ski
lift.

1009
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,930
Suddenly, I heard somebody behind me.

1010
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,980
'Detective Laine,' said a man's voice.

1011
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,270
I turned around.

1012
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:17,200
The man was wearing a black ski mask.

1013
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,869
I couldn't see his face.

1014
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:21,780
Just his brown eyes.

1015
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:25,230
I moved away from the man quickly.

1016
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:31,950
But the man came closer to me and said in
my ear: 'Turn around, Detective.

1017
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:35,610
We're going to get on the ski lift together.'

1018
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:39,030
I felt something hard in my back.

1019
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,210
It felt like a gun.

1020
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,410
There were no people, anywhere.

1021
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:47,490
Just the man with the gun and me.

1022
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:58,000
'And don't do anything stupid,' he said, 'or
I'll kill you.'

1023
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,980
CHAPTER EIGHT
Dangerous Days

1024
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,270
'You can't do this,' I said to the man.

1025
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:12,400
'Be quiet and get on the ski lift,' the man
said.

1026
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,390
He pushed me.

1027
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:17,869
The ski lift had a seat for two people.

1028
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:22,980
The man pushed me into the seat and then he
got in next to me.

1029
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,559
I looked around, but there was nobody up here.

1030
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,960
The ski lift went up.

1031
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,220
Up to the top of the mountain.

1032
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:37,080
I looked at the man, at his brown eyes.

1033
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,349
He was slim.

1034
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:41,320
Was he the man at the Columbine?

1035
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,079
'Give me your gun,' he said.

1036
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:47,059
'My gun?'

1037
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:48,070
I said.

1038
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,250
'Come on,' he said.

1039
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:54,010
'I know you're carrying a gun.'

1040
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,140
I looked down.

1041
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,319
We were thirty feet over the snow.

1042
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:03,210
'And don't do anything stupid,' he said.

1043
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:08,800
I put my hand inside my coat and felt my gun.

1044
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,400
I took it out and gave it to him.

1045
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:20,170
'And now,' said the man, putting my gun in
his pocket, 'you're going to fall... you're

1046
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:23,420
going to fall from the ski lift.'

1047
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,240
'You're crazy!'

1048
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,260
I said.

1049
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,940
'They'll catch you.'

1050
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:33,000
'I'll just say that you fell,' he said.

1051
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,890
Anyway, I don't know you, and you don't know
me, do you?'

1052
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,190
I thought fast.

1053
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:47,650
'I know you work for Ricky Klein,' I said,
taking a chance.

1054
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:51,960
I needed time and I wanted him to talk.

1055
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,740
The man looked at me.

1056
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,420
'You're smart,' he said.

1057
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,190
'And Janine Anderson?'

1058
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,170
I asked.

1059
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,730
'Did you kill her?'

1060
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,640
'We had to,' he said.

1061
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,150
'She knew too much.

1062
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:12,950
She asked too many questions.

1063
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:15,960
And she was very stupid.

1064
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,900
She wanted to tell everyone about it.'

1065
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,980
'How did you know that she was alone in the
swimming pool?'

1066
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,290
I asked.

1067
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:30,670
'I watched her,' he said, 'watched her for
days.'

1068
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:35,429
'From the Columbine restaurant,' I said.

1069
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:40,990
'Yes, she often went to the pool alone in
the evenings.

1070
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,400
It was easy.

1071
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,760
I just went into the hotel through the parking
lot.'

1072
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,609
Yes, I thought.

1073
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:51,750
It couldn't be easier.

1074
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,920
'And then you took her notebook?'

1075
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,540
I asked.

1076
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,830
'Do you think I'm crazy?

1077
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,980
Of course, I took her notebook.

1078
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,230
I burned it.'

1079
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,500
I didn't want him to stop.

1080
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,759
'And she knew the name of the man in the Government
Land Office?'

1081
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:12,859
I asked quickly.

1082
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:20,239
'The man who took a bribe from Ricky Klein
to let him build Alpine Resorts Colorado?'

1083
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:29,420
'Yes, Detective,' he said, 'the Big Boss,
Big CJ.'

1084
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,420
'Big CJ?

1085
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,630
Who's that?'

1086
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,920
I asked.

1087
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,000
'Enough questions,' said the man.

1088
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,940
'I just do the killing, Detective.'

1089
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,359
I looked down.

1090
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,400
We were very high.

1091
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,750
The snow and the trees were a long way down.

1092
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:55,670
I could see two skiers on the mountain but
they were very far away.

1093
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,730
I couldn't shout.

1094
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,290
I couldn't do anything.

1095
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:04,500
'You're next, Detective Laine,' he said.

1096
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,300
'Time to die.'

1097
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,650
I looked down again.

1098
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:13,690
It was a long way down and he was trying to
push me.

1099
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:17,960
I had to do something and I had to do it now.

1100
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,300
The gunman moved to lift up the bar on the
ski lift.

1101
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:28,630
Quickly, I moved forward and hit him in his
face with my right hand.

1102
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:33,870
At the same time, I hit his hand with the
gun in it with my left hand.

1103
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:37,360
The gun flew out of his hand and fell.

1104
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,460
It made no noise as it fell into the snow
far below.

1105
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,980
'You...' he started, 'you...'

1106
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,980
But it was too late.

1107
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:53,870
I hit him on the back of his head, pushed
him and he fell.

1108
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:58,940
Down, down, down.

1109
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,530
I looked down and watched him.

1110
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:05,210
His skis were heavy and he fell fast.

1111
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,590
He fell into the trees far down below.

1112
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:12,280
I pulled down the bar.

1113
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,260
The ski lift went on moving.

1114
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:18,620
Up, up.

1115
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,500
It was quiet again.

1116
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:30,390
The only thing I could hear was the sound
of my heart.

1117
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:33,050
CHAPTER NINE
A lot to lose

1118
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:38,800
'Whisky, please,' I said to Bill Gershon.

1119
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,690
I sat down.

1120
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,190
It was nine o'clock that evening.

1121
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:45,390
We were in his office.

1122
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,750
I needed a drink.

1123
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,610
Gershon took the whisky from his cupboard.

1124
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,630
I smiled at him.

1125
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,739
'Just like Leo,' I said.

1126
01:11:54,739 --> 01:11:59,750
'Do all Chiefs of Police have whisky in their
cupboards?'

1127
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:05,170
Gershon smiled and put the whisky down on
the little table in front of me.

1128
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:07,870
I took a drink of the whisky.

1129
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,620
It was good.

1130
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,080
I looked at Gershon.

1131
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,570
I was alive.

1132
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:21,880
'Tony Rizzo,' I said to Gershon, 'what did
you find out about him?'

1133
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:26,250
The only thing I knew about the gunman was
his name.

1134
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:29,570
The police found his body in the snow.

1135
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:33,900
Tony Rizzo was the name on the driver's license
in his pocket.

1136
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,910
'Tony Rizzo came from New Mexico,' said Gershon.

1137
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,290
'He was a hit man for anybody who paid him.'

1138
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:44,160
A hit man.

1139
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,360
A killer.

1140
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:51,500
And Ricky Klein had enough money to pay him,
I thought.

1141
01:12:51,500 --> 01:13:02,210
Gershon went on: 'He spent four years in prison
near Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1993 to 1997

1142
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,290
for killing a security guard.'

1143
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,310
'Only four years?'

1144
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,310
I asked.

1145
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:11,590
'He got out,' Gershon said.

1146
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:13,640
'His friends helped him.

1147
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,980
He jumped out of a window and onto a furniture
truck.'

1148
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,010
I looked at Gershon.

1149
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,130
He was almost enjoying himself, I thought.

1150
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:27,540
Well, it was different from parking tickets.

1151
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,550
'Anyway,' I said, 'I got everything from him.'

1152
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:36,660
'The whole story?' asked Gershon.

1153
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:39,860
'Well, almost everything,' I said.

1154
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:43,560
'I got Rizzo to talk on the ski lift.

1155
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,070
He killed Janine Anderson.

1156
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,060
And Ricky Klein was behind it.'

1157
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,560
'Wow!' said Gershon.

1158
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,340
'You're good!'

1159
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,380
I smiled.

1160
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:59,900
'That's the nicest thing you've said to me,
Bill,' I said.

1161
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,900
Gershon looked at me and smiled.

1162
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:06,690
Maybe we were becoming friends at last.

1163
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,840
'But there's someone else,' I went on.

1164
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,120
'Someone Rizzo called the "Big Boss, Big CJ".

1165
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,170
Janine Anderson knew a lot.

1166
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:20,580
Everything, I think.

1167
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:25,989
About Klein, how he gave a lot of money to
this Big CJ.

1168
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:29,510
This man who was in the Government Land Office.'

1169
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:34,760
'Government Land Office!' said Bill Gershon
suddenly.

1170
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,970
He put his hand in his pocket and took out
about five pieces of paper.

1171
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,600
'I forgot!

1172
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,680
Here are the names.'

1173
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,810
I took the papers from Gershon and put them
on the table in front of me.

1174
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,690
I read through them.

1175
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:55,380
I was looking for a famous name.

1176
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:59,110
A few minutes later, I looked up at Gershon.

1177
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:03,090
'Bill, there's one name on here that...'

1178
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:07,800
'Yes, I know,' said Gershon.

1179
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,050
His eyes were big and round.

1180
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:15,699
'Governor Clark Johnson... a member of the
GLO!'

1181
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,800
'But it can't be!'

1182
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,640
I said.

1183
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,590
Clark Johnson!

1184
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,330
CJ!

1185
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,940
The Governor of Colorado.

1186
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:31,780
And the man who everyone said was the next
President of the United States.

1187
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,650
I drank my whisky.

1188
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,860
Now I could see everything.

1189
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:44,400
'Janine Anderson had enough to send Klein
to prison for twenty years,' I said to Bill,

1190
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,440
'and she had enough to finish Governor Johnson.

1191
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,880
She wanted to write all about it.

1192
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Of course she had to die.'

1193
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,560
'But how did Janine know about Clark Johnson?'

1194
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,630
'Maybe she guessed at first,' I said.

1195
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:07,920
'She knew that it must be someone important
in the GLO.

1196
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,800
Someone who needed a lot of money.'

1197
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,260
'Wow!' said Gershon.

1198
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:16,840
'If this is true, it's big!'

1199
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:21,010
'Yes,' I said, 'it's big.

1200
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:26,820
Johnson was in the Government Land Office
when Klein built Alpine Resorts Colorado in

1201
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,860
Redridge.

1202
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,670
Johnson needed money.

1203
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,340
He wanted to become Governor.'

1204
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:40,590
'So Klein said, "You let me build Alpine Resorts..."'
said Gershon.

1205
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:42,860
'"And I'll give you money!"

1206
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,780
A lot of money.

1207
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,360
Millions of dollars, probably,' I said.

1208
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,230
'We can look at his bank account easily enough.'

1209
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:56,770
'And then Johnson wanted to become President!'
said Gershon.

1210
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:59,210
'Yes,' I said.

1211
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:03,510
'I think Janine really did have a big story.

1212
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:05,820
The biggest.'

1213
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:12,810
The 'next President of the United States'
took money from Ricky Klein to let Klein build

1214
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,800
a new Alpine Resorts.

1215
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,330
What was bigger than that?

1216
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:24,500
'But now we've got enough to send Klein to
prison for a very long time,' I said.

1217
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,530
'And I think we can get Clark Johnson too.'

1218
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:31,310
'Wow!' said Bill.

1219
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:36,460
'Yes,' I said.

1220
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:40,170
'Wow!'

1221
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,630
CHAPTER TEN
The Big Boss

1222
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:49,590
'That's the story,' I said to Jeff Mason.

1223
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:55,280
Jeff now knew everything about Alpine Resorts
and Ricky Klein.

1224
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,050
And about Governor Clark Johnson.

1225
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:03,570
'So that's why poor Janine died!' he said.

1226
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:05,880
'Because of Clark Johnson!'

1227
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,560
'Yes, and now we need to get Johnson,' I said.

1228
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,870
'What about Klein?' asked Jeff.

1229
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:17,570
'We can't find him,' I said.

1230
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:23,890
'He knows about Rizzo and he's gone - the
police are still looking for him.

1231
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:29,570
We're going to get Johnson,' I went on, 'and
I need your help.'

1232
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:35,470
An hour later, Jeff called Johnson's office.

1233
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:39,170
I listened to the conversation on another
phone.

1234
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:43,690
'I want to speak to Governor Johnson,' said
Jeff.

1235
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:48,760
'I'm sorry, but the Governor is busy now,'
said a young woman.

1236
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,600
'Can I help?'

1237
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,490
'Yes,' said Jeff.

1238
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:58,860
'You can tell the Governor that I want to
talk about my friend Janine Anderson and the

1239
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:03,680
money Governor Johnson took from Mr. Ricky
Klein.'

1240
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,290
Jeff gave the woman his hotel name and his
telephone number.

1241
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,010
Now we just had to wait.

1242
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:15,260
We had to wait for Johnson's new hit man.

1243
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:21,150
Tony Rizzo was dead, but I was sure that Clark
Johnson had another hit man.

1244
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:23,560
Another killer.

1245
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,170
We waited in Jeff's room.

1246
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,000
It was dark.

1247
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,960
Jeff was on the bed.

1248
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,340
Two of Gershon's men waited near the window.

1249
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,570
They had their guns.

1250
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,960
I was behind the door with my gun.

1251
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,679
We waited one hour, two hours.

1252
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:46,830
It was late at night and the hotel was quiet.

1253
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:50,719
Then I heard a noise outside the door.

1254
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,230
Somebody was trying to get in.

1255
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:56,250
The door opened and I could see a man.

1256
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:59,600
I moved fast from behind the door.

1257
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,700
Then I hit him over the back of his head with
my gun.

1258
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,700
He fell to the floor like a tree.

1259
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,190
He didn't move.

1260
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,460
I turned on the light.

1261
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:15,840
Gershon's men came out with their guns and
stood around him.

1262
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,840
One of them took the hit man's gun from his
hand.

1263
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,560
Jeff got up from the bed and came over.

1264
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,710
I looked at the man on the floor.

1265
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:32,810
He was wearing black clothes and he had a
black ski mask over his head.

1266
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:36,110
I took it off and looked at the man's face.

1267
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:38,540
I turned cold.

1268
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,730
I couldn't speak.

1269
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:43,159
Jeff looked at me.

1270
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:47,290
'Do you know him?' he asked.

1271
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:51,050
'Yes,' I said quietly.

1272
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:53,130
'It's Eddie Lang.

1273
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:57,150
The man who killed Scott.'

1274
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:02,530
'Tell me about Governor Clark Johnson,' I
said to Eddie Lang.

1275
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:05,530
'He's behind this, right?'

1276
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:10,449
Eddie Lang looked up and saw all the police
around him.

1277
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,940
'Yes,' he said.

1278
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:18,020
The next day, I was in Gershon's office.

1279
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,380
'We've found Klein,' he said.

1280
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,250
'He's told us everything.'

1281
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,630
Bill Gershon smiled at me.

1282
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:28,270
'Thanks, Flick,' he said.

1283
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:31,030
'Thanks for everything.

1284
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,030
I'm sorry...'

1285
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:36,530
'Forget it,' I said, smiling.

1286
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:42,710
I said goodbye to Gershon and the others - to
Jeff and Teresa, and to Janine Anderson's

1287
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:43,750
parents.

1288
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:47,179
'Thank you,' said Gene Anderson.

1289
01:21:47,179 --> 01:21:50,429
'Thank you so much.'

1290
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:57,240
Then I got in my red Chevy and drove out of
Pine Crest and onto the highway.

1291
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,730
I looked back at the beautiful Rocky Mountains.

1292
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:04,980
The mountains were white and the sky was blue.

1293
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,050
Life was almost good.

1294
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,940
Janine Anderson's killer was dead.

1295
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:17,159
Ricky Klein was going to prison for twenty
years and Alpine Resorts was finished.

1296
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:23,150
Better than that, Clark Johnson, Governor
of Colorado, was finished too.

1297
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:27,810
He could never be President of the United
States now.

1298
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,230
I thought about Scott.

1299
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:32,489
I could feel him smiling at me.

1300
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:37,500
'Good work, Flick,' I could hear him say.

1301
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:46,210
And, perhaps best of all, I thought, Eddie
Lang was going to prison for a very long time!

1302
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:49,400
Yes, life was good.

1303
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,030
I was in my red Chevy and life was good.

1304
01:22:54,030 --> 01:23:04,400
- THE END -
