CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:09,870
The New Puppy
My name is John Grogan and I love dogs.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,510
When I was ten years old, my father gave me
my first dog.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,080
I called him Shaun.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,150
Shaun was my best friend.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,860
He went everywhere with me and he was very
obedient.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,869
When I called him, he came to me.

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,619
He played with me and he walked next to me
without a leash.

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:37,260
In the car, he sat next to me quietly.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,490
After many years, Shaun died.

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,270
He was fourteen years old.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,110
By that time, I wasn't a boy; I was a man.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,640
I had my first job.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,899
Shaun was a great dog.

15
00:00:53,899 --> 00:01:01,469
I wanted to get another dog, but it had to
be as wonderful as Shaun.

16
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,510
Some years later, I moved to Florida and married
Jenny.

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,440
Jenny and I had jobs with newspapers.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,660
We were very happy.

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,400
We were young and in love, and life was wonderful.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,480
One day, I bought a plant for Jenny.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,000
It was very large, with beautiful white flowers.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,050
Jenny loved it - maybe too much.

23
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,110
Every day, she gave it water.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,280
In the end, the plant got sick and died.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,740
Some days later, I woke up early.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,820
Jenny wasn't in bed.

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,290
I found her at the table with a newspaper.

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,700
She had a red pen in her hand.

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,880
"Jenny," I said, "what are you doing?"

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,070
She showed me the newspaper.

31
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,920
It was open at a page of ads.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,390
"Look at this, John," she said.

33
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,610
I saw an ad with a big red line under it:

34
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,530
Beautiful Labrador puppies.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,030
Five weeks old.

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,100
"I can't forget about that plant," Jenny said.

37
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,060
"Why couldn't I look after a plant?

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,360
I only had to give it water, but I killed
it."

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,590
She looked sad, but then she smiled.

40
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,310
"I can't look after a plant, but maybe I can
look after a dog.

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,980
And later, maybe I'll be ready for a baby."

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,240
I thought about that.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,970
Jenny and I wanted to have children one day,
but we loved dogs, too.

44
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,680
Our little house was a good place for a dog.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,200
We lived near a park and near a beach.

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,380
And the house had a big yard with lots of
trees.

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,530
"OK," I said.

48
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,810
I put my arms around Jenny.

49
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,820
"Let's get a dog."

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,350
So some days later, we drove to the address
in the ad.

51
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,620
The house was in the middle of some woods.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,190
A woman came to the door and there was a beautiful
yellow Labrador with her.

53
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,130
"I'm Lori," said the woman.

54
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,310
"And this is Lily.

55
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,480
She's the puppies' mother."

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,120
"Where's the father?"

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,450
I asked.

58
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,170
"Oh," said Lori.

59
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,330
"Sammy Boy?

60
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,470
He's-er-around here somewhere."

61
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,550
Then she said quickly, "Do you want to see
the puppies?"

62
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,200
Lori took us into a room behind the kitchen.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,180
There were a lot of newspapers on the floor,
and a large box by the wall.

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,800
In the box were nine yellow puppies.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,620
"Oh!" cried Jenny.

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,740
"Aren't they beautiful?"

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,980
We sat on the floor with the puppies.

68
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,100
One little puppy really liked us.

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,340
He climbed up our shirts and looked into our
eyes.

70
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,080
"The puppies are $375 each," said Lori.

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,880
"But you can have that puppy for $350."

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,820
I stood up and turned away from the puppies.

73
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,250
Then I turned back quickly and shouted loudly.

74
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,000
The other puppies ran away.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,630
But the little puppy ran to me and climbed
over my shoes.

76
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,380
"That's our puppy," Jenny laughed.

77
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,910
I held him in front of my face.

78
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,770
I looked at him and he looked at me.

79
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,160
He had very large brown eyes.

80
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,200
I gave him to Jenny, and she held him, too.

81
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,280
"I think he likes us," I said.

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,560
We paid Lori for him.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,190
"Come back for him in three weeks," she said.

84
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,669
"He'll be eight weeks old, so you can take
him then."

85
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,120
We thanked Lori and said goodbye.

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,850
On our way to the car, I put my arm around
Jenny.

87
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,600
"Isn't it wonderful?"

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I said.

89
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,220
"We got our dog."

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,160
"Yes," she said.

91
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,120
"I can't wait to bring him home."

92
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,050
Suddenly, we heard a loud noise in the woods.

93
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,940
Something ran out of the trees-something large
and yellow.

94
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,610
It was a big Labrador.

95
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,410
But this dog was very different from Lily.

96
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,340
This dog was wild and dirty.

97
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,669
It had a crazy look in its eyes.

98
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,820
It ran quickly past us, and around the back
of the house.

99
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,419
"I think," I said slowly, "that's Dad."

100
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:19,930
Jenny and I tried to think of a name for our
puppy, but each of us liked different names.

101
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:26,790
One morning, we heard a song by Bob Marley,
the Jamaican singer, on the radio.

102
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,120
Bob Marley was dead, but people played his
music everywhere in Florida.

103
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Jenny and I liked his music, too.

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,390
Suddenly, at the same time, we shouted, "Marley!"

105
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,160
"That's it!"

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,920
I cried.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,280
"That's his name.

108
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,710
Marley!"

109
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,300
Jenny smiled.

110
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,040
Some days later, Jenny's sister called her
from Boston.

111
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,010
"We're visiting Disney World next week with
the children," she said.

112
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,340
"Would you like to come with us?"

113
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,240
Jenny wanted to go to Disney World very much.

114
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,759
"But I won't be here when Marley comes home,"
she said.

115
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,320
"That's OK," I said.

116
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,290
"I'll go and get Marley."

117
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,350
A week later, Jenny left for Orlando.

118
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,540
That evening after work, I drove to Lori's
house.

119
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,340
Marley was a very large puppy now.

120
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,820
"He eats a lot," said Lori.

121
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,389
"Are you ready for your new home, Marley?"

122
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,970
I said.

123
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:43,740
I used his name for the first time and it
felt right.

124
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,419
Marley sat next to me in the car.

125
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:52,250
He tried to climb on me, but each time, he
fell back on the floor.

126
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,990
In the end, he climbed up and sat on me.

127
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,930
He wagged his tail happily.

128
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,430
When we got home, I took off his leash.

129
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,930
Marley began to sniff.

130
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,259
He went around the house and sniffed everything.

131
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:15,430
Then he sat back and looked at me with his
large brown eyes.

132
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,430
I could read Marley's thoughts: This place
is great.

133
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,330
But where are my brothers and sisters?

134
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,100
I took Marley to the garage, next to the house.

135
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,240
It was a warm, dry room.

136
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,110
"Marley," I said.

137
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,209
"This is your room now."

138
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,029
I put some newspapers down on the floor.

139
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,089
I put some playthings down, too.

140
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,970
Then I put some water in a bowl and made a
bed from a large box.

141
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,750
"You're going to sleep here," I said.

142
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,700
I put Marley into the box.

143
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,520
He looked sadly up at me.

144
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,320
I went back into the house and closed the
door.

145
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
I stood and listened.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,529
I could hear nothing.

147
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,490
Then I heard a cry - and then another cry.

148
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,389
The cries got louder and louder.

149
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,379
When I opened the door again, Marley stopped
crying.

150
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,490
I petted him for some time.

151
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,170
Then I left again and closed the door.

152
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,699
Marley started to cry again.

153
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:35,110
I was very tired, so I went to my bedroom.

154
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,959
My bedroom wasn't near the garage, but I could
hear Marley's cries.

155
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,920
I felt sorry for him.

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,540
His family wasn't there.

157
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,149
After I got into bed, I listened to Marley's
cries for half an hour.

158
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,829
Then I got up and went back to the garage.

159
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,470
Marley stopped crying and wagged his tail.

160
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,420
I carried his box into my bedroom and put
it on the floor next to my bed.

161
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,059
Then I got into bed and put my hand down into
the box.

162
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:14,369
Some minutes later, Marley was asleep.

163
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:18,519
I slept, too.

164
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,989
CHAPTER TWO

165
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:27,199
Life with Marley
For the next three days, I played with Marley.

166
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,649
I lay on the floor and he climbed on me.

167
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:37,319
He followed me everywhere, and he tried to
chew on everything.

168
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:42,470
When Jenny came back from Disney World, she
played with Marley, too.

169
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,360
She held him and petted him.

170
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,660
She got up in the night and took him outside.

171
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,449
Most of all, she gave him food.

172
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,369
Marley ate three large bowls of puppy food
every day.

173
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:01,389
He got bigger all the time.

174
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:08,079
His head and his paws were very large, and
his tail was thick and heavy.

175
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,020
When he wagged his tail, he pushed everything
onto the floor-magazines and glasses, and

176
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,209
photos.

177
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,060
Marley loved to grab things and hold them
in his mouth.

178
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,629
He grabbed things from the floor and from
the dining-room table.

179
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:30,319
He grabbed shoes, pens, bottle tops, and many
other things.

180
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:34,370
"All right, what have you got this time?"

181
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,920
I asked.

182
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,139
When I opened his mouth, I always found something
new inside.

183
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:46,279
Every morning, I took Marley for a walk on
the beach.

184
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,730
Then I put him in the garage with a bowl of
water and some playthings.

185
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,319
After that, I went to work.

186
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:58,449
I always said, "Be a good boy, Marley!"

187
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:02,939
Jenny came home at lunchtime and gave him
food.

188
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:06,260
In the evenings, we took Marley down to the
beach again.

189
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,350
But our walks weren't easy.

190
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,709
Marley ran in front of us and pulled on his
leash.

191
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,199
We pulled him back, then he pulled us again.

192
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:22,279
He went this way and that way, and he sniffed
everything.

193
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,949
We tried to teach Marley, "Come!

194
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,170
Stay!

195
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,389
Sit!

196
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,619
Down!

197
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,850
No!"

198
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,160
But he didn't listen to us.

199
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,269
He wasn't obedient.

200
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,379
He was like an excited child.

201
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,899
But every day he got bigger and stronger.

202
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:49,180
"I killed the plant, but I'm good with Marley,"
Jenny said happily.

203
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,279
One day, Jenny invited a friend to our house.

204
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,749
Her friend brought her old dog, Buddy, with
her.

205
00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:00,059
Buddy and Marley ran and played.

206
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:05,199
Then they were tired, so they lay down in
the yard.

207
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:12,100
Some days later, Jenny was with Marley when
she said, "Come and look at this, John!"

208
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,160
I looked, and I saw something small and black
in Marley's fur.

209
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,300
"Oh, no!"

210
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,329
I said.

211
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,779
"Marley has fleas."

212
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,999
They were on his paws, inside his ears, and
under his tail.

213
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:36,550
"Buddy had fleas and he gave them to Marley,"
said Jenny angrily.

214
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,120
She ran out and got into her car.

215
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,209
Half an hour later, she came back with bags
of chemicals.

216
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:48,609
First, she washed Marley's fur with the chemicals.

217
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:53,009
Then she put him in the garage and cleaned
the house carefully.

218
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,639
I cleaned the yard.

219
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:03,799
Every day after that, we looked in Marley's
fur, but we couldn't see any more fleas.

220
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:09,439
Some weeks later, Jenny said, "John, I'm going
to have a baby!"

221
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:13,059
"That's wonderful," I said.

222
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,259
I was very happy.

223
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,779
We were ready for a baby now.

224
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,339
Then Jenny said, "But will those chemicals
be a problem?"

225
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,519
"What chemicals?"

226
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,519
I asked.

227
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,829
"What do you mean?"

228
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,819
"Don't you remember?

229
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,610
I used very strong chemicals when Marley had
fleas.

230
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,379
They can't be good for a baby," she said.

231
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,009
She talked to her doctor about the chemicals.

232
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,420
"It's all right, Jenny," he said.

233
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,670
"Everything will be OK."

234
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,899
Jenny got up early every day and took Marley
for a walk.

235
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,240
She ate lots of fruits and vegetables.

236
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,939
After ten weeks, she and I saw the doctor
again.

237
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:05,420
"Would you like to see your baby?" he asked.

238
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,389
"Yes, please," we said.

239
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:12,319
We felt very excited.

240
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:17,149
The doctor took us into a room at the back
and Jenny lay down.

241
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,920
He moved something over Jenny.

242
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,239
On a machine next to him, we could see something
like a small gray bag.

243
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:28,040
But we couldn't see a baby inside.

244
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,699
"Is there anything in there?" asked Jenny.

245
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:40,050
After a time, the doctor said quietly, "I'm
very sorry, Jenny.

246
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,759
Your baby's dead."

247
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,419
I felt sick.

248
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:48,369
I sat and held Jenny's hand.

249
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:52,319
We didn't say anything for a long time.

250
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,379
When the doctor left, I put my arms around
my wife.

251
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,339
Later, I took her home.

252
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,929
She was very quiet in the car.

253
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,569
Her eyes were red, but she didn't cry.

254
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:12,500
Back home, Jenny went into the dining room
and sat down quietly on a chair.

255
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,980
I got Marley from the garage.

256
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,199
He was very excited.

257
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,429
He jumped up and wagged his tail.

258
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,850
He wanted to play.

259
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:28,989
"Not today, Marley," I said sadly.

260
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,170
Marley ran into the yard.

261
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,709
He came back into the house and drank water
from his bowl.

262
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,989
Then he ran into the dining room and I followed
him.

263
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:44,249
But at the door of the dining-room, I stopped.

264
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:47,759
I saw a wonderful thing.

265
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,959
Marley stood quietly in front of Jenny with
his tail between his legs.

266
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,709
He put his big head on her legs.

267
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,540
He looked at her with his large eyes and made
small cries.

268
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,280
"Marley understands," I thought.

269
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,829
Jenny petted his head and put her face in
his fur.

270
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,620
Then, suddenly, she began to cry.

271
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,600
I went to them and put my arms around them.

272
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:27,440
The three of us stayed there for a long time-
Jenny, Marley, and me.

273
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,120
CHAPTER THREE

274
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,430
The Obedience Class
When Marley was six months old, Dr. Jay, the

275
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,410
animal doctor, told us about an obedience
class.

276
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,490
We loved Marley very much, but he wasn't an
obedient dog.

277
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,740
Every day he got bigger and stronger, and
he didn't listen to us.

278
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,620
He jumped up on us.

279
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,210
He grabbed things in the house and chewed
them.

280
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,190
When I bought flowers for Jenny, Marley ate
them.

281
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,300
We met the teacher of the obedience class.

282
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,120
She had a cold face and she didn't smile.

283
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:18,950
"There are no bad dogs," she said, "but there
are some very weak people."

284
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,330
The class was every Tuesday evening.

285
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,250
We put Marley into the car and drove to the
first class.

286
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,940
When Marley saw the other dogs, he got very
excited.

287
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,090
A party!

288
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,760
He jumped out of the car.

289
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,290
I ran after him, but I couldn't catch him.

290
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,250
Marley sniffed every dog before I caught his
leash.

291
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,030
"Take that dog back to his place in the line,"
said the teacher.

292
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,190
"Who is going to be his boss-you or your wife?"

293
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,140
"I am," I said.

294
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,730
"Me, too," said Jenny.

295
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,310
"No," said the teacher.

296
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,600
"A dog can only have one boss."

297
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,480
"OK," said Jenny.

298
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,900
"I'll do it."

299
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,380
The other dogs sat quietly in a line.

300
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,870
Jenny took Marley to his place.

301
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,950
I stood and watched.

302
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,430
Suddenly, Marley saw another dog at the end
of the line.

303
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,260
That dog looked interesting!

304
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,740
He started to pull Jenny.

305
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,480
She tried to stop him, but she couldn't.

306
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,530
Marley was stronger than Jenny, so he pulled
her to the other dog.

307
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,280
Then he sniffed around it.

308
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:51,330
"That dog thinks he's the boss," said the
teacher coldly.

309
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,540
She started to teach the class "Sit!" and
"Down!".

310
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,600
"Sit!"

311
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,990
Jenny told Marley.

312
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,050
But Marley didn't want to sit.

313
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,280
He jumped up and put his paws on Jenny.

314
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,400
After the class, the teacher said, "You have
to be strong with that animal.

315
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
You're the boss.

316
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,110
Show him that."

317
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:25,610
When we got home, Jenny said, "You can take
Marley to the class next week."

318
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,150
The next Tuesday, Marley and I went back to
the class.

319
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,370
Jenny stayed at home.

320
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,070
In the car, I said to Marley, "I'm the boss!

321
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,490
You're not the boss-I'm the boss!

322
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,120
Do you understand?"

323
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,800
But Marley only looked at me and wagged his
tail.

324
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,140
Then he tried to chew my hands.

325
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,910
In this lesson, the dogs had to walk quietly
next to us.

326
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,450
It was a very important lesson for Marley.

327
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,170
When he went for a walk with Jenny and me,
he always pulled us.

328
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,260
The teacher gave us chains.

329
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,860
"Put the chain over your dog's head," she
said.

330
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,510
"When he pulls you, pull him back with it.

331
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,220
It will hurt him, so he'll stop pulling."

332
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:27,010
I tried to put the chain over Marley's head
but Marley, of course, got very excited.

333
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,270
A new game!

334
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,880
He grabbed the chain with his teeth.

335
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,500
I tried again, but each time, Marley grabbed
it.

336
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,670
In the end, I got the chain over Marley's
head and started to walk with him.

337
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:48,220
When Marley pulled in front of me, I pulled
him back with the chain.

338
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,220
But then he pulled away again.

339
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,550
"Here," said the teacher.

340
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,900
"I'll show you."

341
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,110
She took Marley's leash and started to walk
with him.

342
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,370
Marley pulled the chain, and the teacher pulled
him back.

343
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,160
But then Marley pulled the chain again.

344
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,550
This new game was great!

345
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,740
Then Marley saw me.

346
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,870
He started to run to me and he pulled the
teacher after him.

347
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:25,020
Marley was bigger and stronger than the teacher,
so she couldn't stop him.

348
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,100
She was very angry.

349
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,610
After class, the teacher said, "Your dog isn't
ready for this class.

350
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,690
He's too young.

351
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,700
You can bring him back in six or eight months."

352
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,450
"Are you telling us that we have to leave
the class?"

353
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,490
I said.

354
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,940
"That's right," she said.

355
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,180
"You have to leave."

356
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,770
Because Marley couldn't go back to the class,
I started to teach him at home.

357
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,880
But it was difficult.

358
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,250
Marley wasn't a fast learner.

359
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,160
We had another problem with Marley.

360
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,370
In Florida, there were often thunderstorms.

361
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,060
Marley was afraid of loud noises.

362
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,530
He went crazy in a storm.

363
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,550
He broke things and made everything dirty.

364
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,780
After each storm, Marley quickly forgot about
it.

365
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,240
He was happy again and wanted to play.

366
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,890
But in the next storm, the same thing happened.

367
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:36,390
He was afraid, so he went crazy again.

368
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,360
We talked to Dr. Jay about the problem.

369
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,100
Dr. Jay was young and he understood dogs very
well.

370
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,400
"What can we do?"

371
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
we asked.

372
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,600
"When Marley gets crazy, he breaks things.

373
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,520
One day, he'll get hurt in a storm."

374
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,370
"Marley is seven months old," said Dr. Jay.

375
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,070
"I'll neuter him.

376
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,930
Then he won't get so excited.

377
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,890
He'll be a quieter, happier dog."

378
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,900
I thought about that.

379
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,050
"Oh," I said.

380
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,090
"I don't really know..."

381
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,360
"Yes!" said Jenny.

382
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,870
"That's a great idea!"

383
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,060
"Bring Marley here on your way to work," said
Dr. Jay.

384
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,080
"It doesn't take long.

385
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,990
He'll be ready by the afternoon.

386
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,140
You can get him again on your way home."

387
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,510
A week later, we took Marley to Dr. Jay.

388
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,100
Marley ran from the house and jumped into
the car.

389
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,120
He was very happy.

390
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,050
He loved to go out with Jenny and me-his two
best friends.

391
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,270
Jenny drove and I sat next to her with Marley.

392
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,870
He pushed at the window with his nose.

393
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,510
He wanted to sniff outside the car.

394
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,630
I opened the window and Marley put his nose
outside.

395
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,950
"I feel sorry for Marley," I said to Jenny.

396
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,490
Then I looked at him.

397
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,080
His front paws were out of the window.

398
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,110
"John," said Jenny, "what's Marley doing?

399
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,000
Please be careful."

400
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,660
"He's fine," I said.

401
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,250
"He only wants to put his head outside."

402
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,360
Marley put his head out of the window.

403
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,720
Then suddenly, he pushed his front legs out,
too.

404
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,000
He tried to jump down on the road.

405
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,320
But the road was very busy with cars.

406
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,330
"John!"

407
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,340
shouted Jenny.

408
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,350
"Hold him!"

409
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,530
Jenny tried to stop the car, but she couldn't.

410
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,930
The other cars drove around us very fast.

411
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,070
It was very dangerous.

412
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,460
Now Marley's front paws were down on the road.

413
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,370
He ran next to the car.

414
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,190
I grabbed him by his tail and Jenny stopped
the car.

415
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,880
"Now what?"

416
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,580
I shouted.

417
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,190
I couldn't pull Marley back into the car.

418
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,810
I couldn't open the door.

419
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,840
I couldn't get my other arm out.

420
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,250
And there were cars all around us.

421
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,370
The other drivers looked at us angrily.

422
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,960
Jenny opened her door and got out of the car.

423
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,770
She ran around it and grabbed Marley.

424
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,480
I opened my door and got out, too.

425
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,990
In the end, we got Marley back into the car.

426
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,870
When we got to Dr. Jay's, I took Marley inside.

427
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:54,490
He sniffed everywhere, then he pushed over
a table with magazines on it.

428
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,790
I gave Marley's leash to Dr. Jay.

429
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,750
"Please neuter him as quickly as possible,"
I said.

430
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,980
"Please."

431
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:10,360
That evening, when I took Marley home, I saw
a change in him.

432
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,940
He wasn't excited and crazy.

433
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,170
He moved quietly and slowly.

434
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:22,100
"Good," I thought.

435
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,590
CHAPTER FOUR

436
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:30,220
Changes at Home
Jenny and I worked hard at our jobs.

437
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,200
We also worked hard at home.

438
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,430
So one evening I said, "Let's go on vacation,
Jenny."

439
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,970
The next day, I bought two airplane tickets.

440
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,940
They were for a three-week vacation in Ireland.

441
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,120
"What are we going to do about Marley?" asked
Jenny.

442
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,370
"We can leave him in the house," I said.

443
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,250
"Somebody can stay here with him."

444
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,840
"Marley is a difficult dog," said Jenny.

445
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,250
"That person will have to be kind but also
strong.

446
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,060
He or she will have to be his boss."

447
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,980
"I know," I said.

448
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,130
Then I had an idea.

449
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,270
"Kathy loves animals."

450
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,570
Kathy worked in my office.

451
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,950
The next day, I asked her and she said yes.

452
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,260
Before she arrived, I wrote some notes for
her about Marley.

453
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,010
There were six pages of notes.

454
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,860
I showed them to Jenny.

455
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,310
"Did I forget anything?"

456
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,570
I asked.

457
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:43,020
Jenny read the notes, then she said, "You
can't tell Kathy all that.

458
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,200
She won't want to stay with Marley."

459
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,920
But when Kathy read the notes, she smiled.

460
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,180
"Marley and I will be fine," she said.

461
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,380
"Have a great vacation."

462
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,210
Jenny and I had a wonderful vacation in Ireland.

463
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,580
The weather was fine and warm.

464
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,760
We drove on small country roads and walked
by the ocean.

465
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,630
At night, we stayed in the houses of Irish
families.

466
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,810
We forgot about our jobs in Florida.

467
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,760
When we arrived home, Marley ran outside to
us.

468
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,880
Kathy stood at the door.

469
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,260
She looked very tired.

470
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,340
Her bag was next to her.

471
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:31,690
"I'm sorry," she said, "but Marley broke a
lot of things in the house.

472
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,370
He wasn't obedient and he didn't listen to
me."

473
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,450
We thanked Kathy, but she wanted to leave
very quickly.

474
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,000
I turned to Marley.

475
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,200
"All right, Marley," I said.

476
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,540
"Tomorrow you're going to learn about obedience."

477
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,590
The next morning, Jenny and I went back to
work.

478
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:00,470
But first, I put the chain around Marley's
neck and took him for a walk.

479
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,580
Marley started to pull me.

480
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,680
"Sit, Marley!"

481
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,940
I said.

482
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,150
Marley sat.

483
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,970
"OK, let's try that again," I said.

484
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,309
We started to walk and Marley pulled me again.

485
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:21,610
I made the chain very short and pulled him
back.

486
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,830
It hurt him, but it was the only way.

487
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,230
In the end, he learned his lesson.

488
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,270
He walked next to me and didn't pull me.

489
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,180
I felt very happy.

490
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,050
"Good, Marley," I said.

491
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,960
"I'm the boss."

492
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,559
Some days later, Jenny called me at the office.

493
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,560
"John," she said.

494
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,690
"I went to see the doctor.

495
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,940
I'm going to have a baby."

496
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:01,470
This time, Jenny and I were very careful and
we put away every chemical in the house.

497
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,150
Jenny looked well.

498
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,790
She got up early each morning and took Marley
for a walk by the ocean.

499
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:13,970
When we went to the doctor, we saw our baby
on the machine.

500
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,720
But I didn't forget about Marley.

501
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,309
I worked with him every day.

502
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:26,320
Marley was more obedient now, but he didn't
listen to me all the time.

503
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,440
He came when I called him-sometimes.

504
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,710
In our yard, we had a fruit tree.

505
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,400
Marley loved eating fruit, but it went through
him quickly.

506
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,980
His poop was everywhere in the yard.

507
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,290
He ate a lot of other things, too.

508
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:54,000
These went through him and came out in his
poop-toys, pens, and bottle tops.

509
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,809
I bought Jenny a beautiful chain for her birthday.

510
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:01,240
She loved it and she put it around her neck.

511
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,230
But some hours later she cried, My chain!

512
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,530
Where is it?

513
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,450
Maybe I didn't put it on right."

514
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,870
"We didn't go outside," I said.

515
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,700
"So it's here in the house."

516
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,630
We looked in every room, but we couldn't find
the chain.

517
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,230
Suddenly Jenny said, "What's that in Marley's
mouth?"

518
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,400
I saw the end of a thin chain.

519
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,150
"Oh, no!"

520
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,900
I cried.

521
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,580
"OK, Marley, it's all right.

522
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,830
Come here now.

523
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,770
Please give us the chain."

524
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,140
But Marley only looked at us.

525
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,280
Suddenly, he threw his head back.

526
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,140
"He's eating the chain!"

527
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,030
cried Jenny.

528
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,250
I opened his mouth and pushed my hand down.

529
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,410
But I couldn't find the chain.

530
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,670
"We'll have to wait," I said.

531
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:07,450
"The chain will go through Marley and come
out in his poop."

532
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,430
I gave Marley lots of fruit.

533
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,790
We waited for three days.

534
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,630
I followed Marley everywhere.

535
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,520
When he pooped, I looked for the chain.

536
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,130
But it wasn't there.

537
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,380
On the fourth day, I found it.

538
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,150
After I washed it, it was very clean.

539
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,000
It had a beautiful shine.

540
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,260
"That's wonderful," Jenny said.

541
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,470
"It shines better than before."

542
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,120
Jenny wore that chain for years.

543
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,230
When I saw it, I always thought of Marley.

544
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,500
Our son was born in St. Mary's Hospital in
Palm Beach.

545
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,310
We called him Patrick, an Irish name.

546
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:59,070
"Things are going to change at home for Marley
now, said Jenny.

547
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,300
"Maybe he won't like the changes."

548
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,170
I brought Jenny and Patrick home from the
hospital.

549
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,889
Patrick was asleep and we put him on our bed.

550
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,549
Then we went to the garage and brought Marley
into the house.

551
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:21,480
He followed Jenny into the bedroom, but he
didn't see Patrick on the bed.

552
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,829
Then Patrick made a small noise and Marley's
ears went up.

553
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:31,879
Where did that noise come from?

554
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:34,720
Patrick made another noise.

555
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,210
Marley held up a paw, and Jenny and I watched
him.

556
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,009
"What's Marley going to do?"

557
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:44,520
I thought.

558
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,819
Marley jumped up onto the bed.

559
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:51,000
I pulled him back quickly and held him.

560
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,730
Patrick's eyes were very wide.

561
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,919
But Marley didn't want to hurt Patrick.

562
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:00,999
He sniffed all around him.

563
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,849
Now Marley had a new best friend.

564
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:07,880
When he was near Patrick, he wasn't wild and
crazy.

565
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,910
At night, he slept under Patrick's bed.

566
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,029
Six months later, Patrick started to move
around.

567
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:21,690
Marley lay on the floor and Patrick climbed
over him.

568
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,489
Sometimes Patrick pulled Marley s fur.

569
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,740
But Marley lay quietly and didn't move.

570
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,319
We were parents now and we were happy.

571
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,809
We had our wonderful baby.

572
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,680
We had our dog.

573
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,319
We had our house by the ocean.

574
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:41,089
Life was good.

575
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:51,609
Then, when Patrick was nine months old, Jenny
said, "I'm going to have another baby."

576
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,140
CHAPTER FIVE

577
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:01,070
Difficult Days
Sometimes, bad things happened in our street.

578
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,559
One night, in October, Jenny and I were in
bed.

579
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,210
Marley lay on the floor next to me.

580
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,269
Suddenly, I heard a cry - the cry of a girl.

581
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,589
It came from the street outside.

582
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:19,890
I felt afraid, but I jumped out of bed.

583
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,970
"Come with me, Marley," I said.

584
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,690
"Please, John, don't go out there," said Jenny.

585
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,599
"Call the police," I said.

586
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,019
"I'll be careful."

587
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:37,150
I held Marley by the end of his chain.

588
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,670
The girl cried again.

589
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,480
We went outside, and a man ran away down the
street.

590
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,420
Two young men ran to me.

591
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,170
"Go and stay with the girl," they shouted.

592
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,170
"Help her.

593
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,580
We're going after the man."

594
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,609
I ran to the girl.

595
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:59,059
She was my neighbor's daughter, Lisa.

596
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,230
She was seventeen years old.

597
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,039
Her shirt was red and wet.

598
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,930
"What happened?"

599
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,369
I asked.

600
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:11,089
"I was in my car," she said.

601
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:16,130
"A man got in and put his hand over my mouth."

602
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,340
He said, "Don't make a noise!

603
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,380
But I did, and he cut me with his knife."

604
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,660
I held Lisa in my arms.

605
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,070
"It's going to be all right," I said.

606
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,109
But I didn't really think that.

607
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:38,680
Lisa's face was gray, and she was very weak.

608
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,559
I looked at Marley.

609
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,249
He stood and looked down the street.

610
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:46,579
He looked strong and ready for a fight.

611
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:50,450
Nobody could get past him.

612
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,089
Some minutes later the police arrived, with
doctors, and they took Lisa away.

613
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:59,599
A policeman asked me questions.

614
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,150
Then I went home with Marley.

615
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,640
Jenny met us at the door.

616
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,589
"Marley was a different dog tonight," I said.

617
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:13,109
"Nothing can hurt us when he's with us."

618
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:14,770
I looked at Marley.

619
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,049
"You did well tonight," I said.

620
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,960
Lisa didn't die.

621
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,339
She got well again.

622
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:27,140
But I never forgot that night.

623
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,150
One night, when Jenny and I were in bed, she
said, "John, I think the baby is coming.

624
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,769
Please call the doctor."

625
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:38,739
"Something's wrong," I thought.

626
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:42,420
"It's too early for the baby."

627
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,089
I took Jenny to the hospital.

628
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:50,119
"Your baby is too small," the doctor said
to her.

629
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,289
"We have to stop him coming out.

630
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,670
You'll have to stay in the hospital."

631
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,920
Jenny was in the hospital for twelve days.

632
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,920
I stayed at home with Patrick and Marley.

633
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,410
I did the housework.

634
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,140
I cooked and washed clothes.

635
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,660
In the evenings, I was very tired.

636
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,349
Marley sat and looked at me sadly.

637
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:18,180
I could read his thoughts.

638
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,599
I don't understand.

639
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,980
Why doesn't John want to play with me?

640
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,349
Why doesn't he take me for walks?

641
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:29,759
And where's Jenny?

642
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:33,049
I didn't do things at home very well.

643
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:36,930
I left the bathroom door open all the time.

644
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:42,720
Marley loved to go into the bathroom, and
to drink water from the shower.

645
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,390
One day, I took Patrick on a visit to the
hospital.

646
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,249
"What did you do to Patrick?"

647
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:51,249
Jenny asked.

648
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:53,579
"What do you mean?"

649
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:54,869
I asked.

650
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:56,150
"He's fine."

651
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,839
"Look at him," said Jenny.

652
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,540
I looked.

653
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,930
His arms were in the legs of his baby clothes!

654
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,470
Jenny called my aunt Anita.

655
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,380
She also lived in Florida, but in a different
town.

656
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,869
"Please can you look after John and Patrick,"
she said.

657
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:21,960
Two days later, Aunt Anita arrived.

658
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,630
She did the housework and everything at home
was fine again.

659
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,000
When Jenny came home, she had to stay in bed
all day.

660
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,989
This was a very difficult time for her.

661
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:38,059
She couldn't cook or go for a walk.

662
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:42,749
Worst of all, she couldn't hold Patrick.

663
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:47,740
Marley brought his playthings into the bedroom
and lay on the floor next to Jenny.

664
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,720
He stayed there day and night.

665
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,390
Aunt Anita had to go home to her husband.

666
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,500
So I had to look after the house again.

667
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:04,029
Then, one day, when the doctor visited Jenny,
he said, "You can get up now.

668
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,059
The baby is bigger."

669
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,400
Jenny was very happy.

670
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,539
She got up and played with Patrick and Marley.

671
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,070
She started to do the housework.

672
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,730
The next day, we went to a Greek restaurant
for lunch.

673
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:26,690
But suddenly, the baby started to come, so
I took Jenny to the hospital.

674
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,470
Then everything happened very quickly.

675
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:37,260
One hour later, I held my beautiful new son
in my arms.

676
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,890
Jenny and I had two sons now, Patrick and
Conor.

677
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,269
One was seventeen months old, and one was
a baby.

678
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:53,160
We were very happy with our sons, but we were
tired all the time.

679
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,130
The babies woke us every night.

680
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,460
We couldn't sleep for more than two hours.

681
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,720
Conor had problems with Jenny's milk.

682
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,619
After he drank, he was sick.

683
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:08,109
So Jenny was very sad.

684
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,880
"What's wrong with me?"

685
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
she said.

686
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,890
"Conor doesn't like my milk.

687
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,859
Maybe I'm not a good mom."

688
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:20,819
She started to get angry quickly.

689
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:28,210
She didn't get angry with Patrick and Conor,
but she was often angry with Marley and me.

690
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,529
Marley could do nothing right.

691
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:33,950
I bought a plant and planted it in the yard.

692
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,329
The next day, Marley pulled it out and ate
it.

693
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:41,489
Then he broke a door in the house.

694
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:46,410
He went crazy when there was a thunderstorm.

695
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:51,170
One day when I got home from work, I found
Marley with Jenny.

696
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,249
Jenny was very, very angry.

697
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:58,109
"Why do you break everything?"

698
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,109
she shouted.

699
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,979
"You're a very bad dog."

700
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:08,999
Marley stood with his head down, and she hit
him again and again.

701
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:11,450
I went and grabbed Jenny's arms.

702
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,450
"Hey!

703
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,450
Hey!

704
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,450
Hey!"

705
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,450
I shouted.

706
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,529
"Stop.

707
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:17,970
Stop!"

708
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,979
I looked into Jenny's face, but the look in
her eyes was new to me.

709
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:27,000
Her face was the face of a stranger.

710
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,950
"Get him out of here," she said.

711
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,130
"Get him out of here now."

712
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,190
I opened the front door and Marley ran outside.

713
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:45,690
When I turned back for his leash, Jenny said,
"You have to find Marley a new home."

714
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,650
She couldn't mean it.

715
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,999
She loved this dog.

716
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,530
I walked out of the door.

717
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,200
Marley ran and jumped around.

718
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,650
He wasn't hurt.

719
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,160
I took Marley into the street and said, "Sit!"

720
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,970
He sat.

721
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,740
I put his chain over his head with the leash.

722
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,150
Then I took him for a very long walk.

723
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,359
When we got home, Marley was very tired.

724
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,890
I took off Marley's leash and he ran to his
bowl.

725
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,910
The water went everywhere on the floor.

726
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,640
I cleaned it.

727
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,260
Jenny sat in a chair with Patrick and Conor.

728
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:35,739
When I walked past her, she said quietly,
"I want that dog to leave."

729
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,319
I felt very sad.

730
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,269
Marley was my friend and I loved him.

731
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:43,989
I didn't want to find a new home for him.

732
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:48,319
But I also had a wife and two small children.

733
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,579
I had to think about them.

734
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:54,680
I talked to my friends and neighbors about
Marley.

735
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,349
"Do you want a Labrador?"

736
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:58,749
I asked.

737
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:00,690
But nobody did.

738
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,920
I looked in the newspapers.

739
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:09,349
They were full of ads from people with dogs,
and a lot of the ads were for Labradors.

740
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:13,680
"These people paid a lot of money for their
dogs," I thought.

741
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,450
"But now they're looking for new homes for
them.

742
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:24,599
Maybe Labradors are too difficult-too big
and strong."

743
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,880
Marley wasn't an easy dog.

744
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,369
He wasn't obedient and he broke things.

745
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,499
But we brought him to our home when he was
a puppy.

746
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:36,589
He loved us and we loved him.

747
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:40,309
He was our dog.

748
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:43,529
I took Marley back to the obedience class.

749
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:46,359
A different teacher was there now.

750
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:48,599
This time, things went better.

751
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,589
I said "Sit!" and Marley sat.

752
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:56,069
I put the chain around his neck and he walked
quietly next to me.

753
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:59,450
I said "Stay!" and he stayed.

754
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,289
I walked away from him, but he didn't move.

755
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:06,440
Then I turned and said, "Come!"

756
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,599
Marley ran quickly to me.

757
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,580
"Good boy, Marley," I said.

758
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,539
"Good, good, good boy!"

759
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:20,400
At the end of the eight weeks, the teacher
gave me a paper.

760
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,730
It said, "Marley did well in the obedience
class."

761
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,819
I was very happy.

762
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:31,160
On the way home, I sang.

763
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,520
After this, a wonderful thing happened.

764
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,420
Jenny got better.

765
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,660
She stopped being sad, and was strong and
happy.

766
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:46,500
She was a good mother to Patrick and Conor,
and she was kind to Marley again.

767
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,680
She danced around the room with him.

768
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,200
Sometimes at night, when he was quiet, she
lay on the floor with him, her head on his

769
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,390
neck.

770
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:01,960
"Jenny's here with us again," I thought.

771
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,400
"That's great!"

772
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,859
CHAPTER SIX

773
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:13,140
Marley Makes a Movie
Jenny's friend Colleen worked for a film company.

774
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,829
One day, Colleen called Jenny.

775
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:21,349
"My company is making a film about a family
in Florida," she said.

776
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:24,739
"They want pictures of a family home.

777
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:28,589
Can I come and take some pictures of your
house?"

778
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:34,829
Colleen came and took photos of our home and
the children-and of Marley, too.

779
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:38,809
She showed them to her boss, Bob Gosse.

780
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:42,079
Some days later, Jenny called me at work.

781
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,829
"Bob Gosse is making a movie about a family
with a dog," she said excitedly.

782
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,869
"So he's looking for a dog-a big, family dog.

783
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:57,380
He saw Colleen's photos and he's interested
in Marley."

784
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,700
"Really?"

785
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,910
I said.

786
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,069
"You mean...

787
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:03,150
Marley?

788
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,529
Our Marley?"

789
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:11,710
The next day, Colleen came to our house and
took Marley to her boss.

790
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,310
Two hours later, she brought him back again.

791
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,779
"Marley was great," she said.

792
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:22,349
"Everybody loved him."

793
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:25,500
Some days later, the company started filming.

794
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:33,599
"Bring Marley to the Gulfstream Hotel at nine
o'clock," Bob Gosse told us.

795
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,769
We put the children and Marley into the car
and drove to the hotel.

796
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:41,509
A lot of people stood outside.

797
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:44,239
The police were there, too.

798
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,789
One of the policemen looked inside the car.

799
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:52,450
He saw Jenny, two small children, and a large
dog.

800
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:56,230
"You can't come this way," he said.

801
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,289
"You have to turn back."

802
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:03,819
"But we're with the film company," I said.

803
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,950
"Our dog is in the movie."

804
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,410
"Really?"

805
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,640
the police officer said.

806
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,869
Then he looked at a paper in his hand.

807
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,499
"You have the dog?"

808
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:18,380
Marley's name was on the paper.

809
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,630
"I have the dog," I said.

810
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,719
"Marley the Dog."

811
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:27,099
"Oh," said the policeman.

812
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:31,760
He turned to another policeman and shouted,
"He has the dog.

813
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,920
Marley the Dog!"

814
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,339
Then he turned to us again.

815
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:39,549
"You can come in," he said.

816
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:42,030
I felt very important.

817
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,930
Marley was famous!

818
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,750
The cameramen started to film Marley.

819
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,799
But Marley wasn't obedient.

820
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:51,430
He ran and jumped.

821
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,519
He chewed through his leash.

822
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:54,519
"Cut!

823
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:55,519
Cut!

824
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,519
Cut!"

825
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:57,519
shouted Bob Gosse.

826
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,760
At the end of the day, we took Marley home.

827
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,000
"Marley," I said sadly, "you're not going
to be famous."

828
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,809
But the next day, the film company called
again.

829
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:16,509
"Please bring Marley back here," they said.

830
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:24,589
When we got back to the hotel, Bob Gosse said,
"On film, Marley was great."

831
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:28,930
Marley had a very good time with the people
in the film company.

832
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,119
Everybody played with him and petted him.

833
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:35,130
After four days, the cameramen stopped filming.

834
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,529
"Call us after eight months," said Bob Gosse.

835
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:41,390
"The movie will be ready then."

836
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:45,859
After eight months, we called the company.

837
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:52,290
The name of the movie was The Last Home Run,
but we couldn't learn anything about it.

838
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,010
I called the company again and again.

839
00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:02,170
Two years later, I was in a store and there
were a lot of movies on the shelves.

840
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,270
Suddenly, I saw The Last Home Run.

841
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,739
Marley's movie!

842
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:10,750
I bought it and took it home.

843
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,040
"Come and watch this!"

844
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,019
I shouted to Jenny and the children.

845
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:18,510
We saw Marley in the movie.

846
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:23,030
He was only there for two minutes, but it
was very exciting.

847
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,480
We all laughed and cried.

848
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,640
"We're famous!"

849
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,349
shouted Patrick.

850
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:33,150
Marley's name came at the end of the film.

851
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:39,420
In big letters, it said, "Marley the Dog."

852
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,559
Sometime later, we said goodbye to our home
in West Palm Beach.

853
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:48,619
The place got more and more dangerous, and
our house was too small for two children and

854
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,609
a large dog.

855
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:55,940
So we moved to a bigger house in another city,
Boca Raton.

856
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,259
A lot of rich people lived in Boca Raton.

857
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:05,109
They had expensive cars, big houses, and beautiful
clothes.

858
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:07,869
There were many good things about our new
house.

859
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:10,390
Near the house was a small park.

860
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,890
But, best of all, it had a pool.

861
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,829
We all loved the pool, but Marley loved it
most.

862
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:23,190
He jumped in with me and climbed on me.

863
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,729
But there was a problem with the garage in
our new house.

864
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:31,109
It had no windows and it got very hot in summer.

865
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:36,630
So we couldn't put Marley in it when there
was a thunderstorm.

866
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:42,390
I took Patrick and Conor to the pet store
and we bought a strong cage for Marley.

867
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,430
We put it next to the washing machine.

868
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,690
I put some food in the cage.

869
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,210
"Come here, Marley," I called.

870
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:56,299
Marley went inside and I closed the door of
the cage after him.

871
00:52:56,299 --> 00:53:00,470
He lay down on the floor and chewed his food
happily.

872
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,710
"This is going to be your new home when we're
away," I said.

873
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:09,579
That evening, we went out for dinner.

874
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:13,329
Before we left, I opened the door of the cage.

875
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:16,499
Marley walked inside and I closed the door.

876
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:21,460
"Be a good boy, Marley," I said.

877
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,020
We had dinner in a restaurant, then we went
for a walk.

878
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,220
"This is great," said Jenny.

879
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,849
"We can forget about Marley.

880
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:33,240
We know he's fine in the cage."

881
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,249
She smiled happily.

882
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:39,940
We went home and walked to the front door.

883
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,810
I looked at the window next to it.

884
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:48,680
Something was there, in the window- something
black, and wet.

885
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,390
It was Marley's nose.

886
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,729
"What's that?"

887
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:55,109
I said.

888
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:57,849
"How could...

889
00:53:57,849 --> 00:53:59,220
Marley?"

890
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,710
When I opened the front door, Marley ran to
us happily.

891
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,039
Everything in the house was fine.

892
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:08,170
Then we looked at the cage.

893
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,920
The door was open.

894
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,450
"But how did Marley get out?" asked Jenny.

895
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,900
"He opened the door from inside," I said.

896
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,640
"He's smart, and he's very strong."

897
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,359
Day after day, when we left the house, we
put Marley into the cage.

898
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:34,319
When we came home, sometimes he was there.

899
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,940
Sometimes he was at the window.

900
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:42,430
We tried to make the cage stronger, but Marley
was stronger than the cage.

901
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:48,299
When he wanted to get out, he pushed the door
open.

902
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:49,660
CHAPTER SEVEN

903
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:57,539
The World's Worst Dog
Many people in Boca Raton had dogs, but their

904
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:00,599
dogs were very different from Marley.

905
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,279
Most of these dogs were very, very small.

906
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:09,460
Rich women carried them in their handbags,
and took them into expensive stores, and in

907
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:12,200
their fast cars.

908
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,369
Marley wanted very much to be friends with
these small dogs, but the dogs didn't want

909
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:20,609
to be friends with Marley.

910
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:26,609
The weather in Boca Raton was very good, so
lots of restaurants had tables and chairs

911
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:27,839
outside.

912
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,789
Customers brought their dogs with them to
the restaurants.

913
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:38,710
People ate their food or drank coffee, and
their dogs lay quietly on the ground.

914
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,599
One Sunday afternoon, we went out for lunch.

915
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,920
We parked our car and walked up and down the
street.

916
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,390
Many other people were out with their dogs,
too.

917
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:54,380
Marley walked next to me on his leash.

918
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,079
We found a restaurant and sat down outside.

919
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,239
I put Marley's leash around one of the legs
of the strong, heavy table.

920
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:06,710
The waiter came and we asked for some drinks.

921
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,180
Then Jenny held up her glass happily.

922
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,680
"To a beautiful day with my beautiful family!"

923
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,319
she said.

924
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:19,579
Suddenly, our table started to move.

925
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:23,969
It moved quickly between the other tables
and the other customers.

926
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:26,009
"What's happening?"

927
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:28,049
I thought.

928
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:32,279
Then I saw a small white dog across the street.

929
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:36,079
"Marley's going to that dog," I shouted.

930
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,160
"We have to stop him!"

931
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,849
We jumped up and ran after Marley and the
table.

932
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:43,880
"Sorry!

933
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,900
Sorry!

934
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,930
Sorry!"

935
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,670
we shouted to the other customers.

936
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,390
I ran and grabbed the table.

937
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,259
Jenny grabbed it, too.

938
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:56,339
We held it and it stopped moving.

939
00:56:56,339 --> 00:57:00,960
I turned around and saw the faces of the other
customers.

940
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,819
Everybody looked at us with their mouths open.

941
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:08,839
We carried the table back to its place, and
a waiter came.

942
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:13,660
"I'll get some more drinks for you," he said.

943
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,789
"No," said Jenny.

944
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:20,490
"We'll pay for our drinks and leave."

945
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,150
Jenny and I had another baby.

946
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:28,490
This time it was a girl and we named her Colleen.

947
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,969
When Colleen was two months old, I had my
fortieth birthday.

948
00:57:32,969 --> 00:57:39,869
I wanted to do something exciting on my birthday,
but it was a very quiet day.

949
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:43,410
When I arrived home from work, Jenny was tired.

950
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:49,269
By eight-thirty, all three children were asleep
and Jenny was, too.

951
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,670
I felt a little sad.

952
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,750
I took a drink outside.

953
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,730
I sat and looked at the ocean.

954
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,160
Marley lay on the ground next to me.

955
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,869
I thought about my life, then I thought about
Marley.

956
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:07,859
He wasn't a puppy now; he was six years old.

957
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,160
But he loved life and he was very happy.

958
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:16,170
"Marley," I said, "it's only you and me tonight."

959
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,029
I held up my glass.

960
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:23,700
"We're not young, but we're having a good
time."

961
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,760
Some days later, my friend Jim called me.

962
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,829
"Let's go out for a drink on Saturday," he
said.

963
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:36,519
Jim came for me at six o'clock and we went
out to a bar.

964
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:38,640
We talked and laughed.

965
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,509
Then the barman called out, "Is John Grogan
here?

966
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:46,609
There's a phone call for John Grogan."

967
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:47,859
It was Jenny.

968
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:50,880
"The baby's crying," she said.

969
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,589
"Can you come and help me?"

970
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:58,690
"I'll take you home," Jim said.

971
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:03,019
When we turned into my street, I saw a lot
of cars.

972
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:06,380
"Somebody's having a party," I said.

973
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:11,549
Jim stopped the car outside my house and I
invited him inside.

974
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,920
Then, suddenly, the front door opened.

975
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,680
Jenny stood there with Colleen in her arms.

976
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,739
She had a big smile on her face.

977
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:23,989
I looked into the yard.

978
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:29,019
There were lots of people around the pool-my
friends and neighbors.

979
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:32,680
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JOHN!"

980
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,119
they shouted.

981
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,160
I wanted to take Marley to the beach.

982
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:45,180
You couldn't take pets onto most beaches in
South Florida, but one small beach was different.

983
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,309
Everybody called it Dog Beach.

984
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:51,740
On Dog Beach, dogs could run freely.

985
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,869
They didn't have to be on a leash.

986
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:59,069
One morning in June, I took Marley to Dog
Beach.

987
00:59:59,069 --> 01:00:03,819
There were lots of people with dogs, but the
dogs were on leashes.

988
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:05,880
"What happened?"

989
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,739
I asked a man.

990
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:10,549
"The police came," the man said.

991
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:14,119
"We have to use a leash."

992
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:16,640
So I walked Marley on his leash.

993
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,040
But I felt sorry for him.

994
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,130
After our walk, I gave Marley a bowl of water.

995
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,759
Then a man arrived with a big black dog.

996
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:28,799
It looked dangerous.

997
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,430
"Don't be afraid of him," said the man.

998
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,380
"This is Killer.

999
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,180
But he's very friendly.

1000
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,940
He doesn't fight other dogs."

1001
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,569
I told the man about the police.

1002
01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:44,339
"That's stupid!" he shouted.

1003
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:46,900
"This is Dog Beach!"

1004
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:52,750
He took off Killer's leash, and Killer ran
into the water.

1005
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,920
Marley looked at Killer and then he looked
at me.

1006
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,660
I could read his thoughts: Please!

1007
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,660
Please!

1008
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,660
Please!

1009
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,299
I'll be good!

1010
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:05,200
I looked around the beach.

1011
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,279
I couldn't see any policemen.

1012
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:14,240
I took off Marley's leash and he ran into
the ocean after Killer.

1013
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,460
Marley and Killer played happily in the water.

1014
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,630
Other people watched them.

1015
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:23,170
Then they took off their dogs' leashes, too.

1016
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:25,640
The dogs ran into the water.

1017
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,569
But then Marley started to drink from the
ocean.

1018
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:31,609
"Stop that, Marley!"

1019
01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:32,969
I cried.

1020
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:36,030
"You'll be sick!"

1021
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:40,079
But Marley didn't listen to me and he didn't
stop drinking.

1022
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,240
Then he started to turn around in the water.

1023
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,900
"Oh, no!"

1024
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,900
I thought.

1025
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,660
I ran into the water.

1026
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,890
But it was too late.

1027
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,450
Marley pooped everywhere.

1028
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,469
"Hey!"

1029
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:58,019
somebody shouted angrily.

1030
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:00,299
"Get your dog!"

1031
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,829
"Marley, no!"

1032
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,359
I shouted.

1033
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:08,209
I could feel everybody's eyes on me - and
on Marley.

1034
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:10,959
"No, Marley, no!

1035
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:11,959
No!

1036
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:12,959
No!

1037
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:13,959
No!"

1038
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:17,150
Marley's poop was everywhere.

1039
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,449
The other people grabbed their dogs.

1040
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:24,490
Marley came out of the dirty water and looked
at me happily.

1041
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,910
But we had to leave.

1042
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:32,219
"That wasn't nice," the man with Killer said.

1043
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:34,819
"Sorry," I said.

1044
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:37,940
I put Marley's leash on him.

1045
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,329
Other dogs didn't drink water from the ocean.

1046
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:46,069
Marley wasn't a bad dog, but sometimes he
did stupid things.

1047
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:49,150
"What's wrong with you, Marley?"

1048
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,089
I said on the drive home.

1049
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:55,449
"Sometimes you're the worst dog in the world."

1050
01:02:55,449 --> 01:03:01,819
I never took Marley to the beach again.

1051
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,219
CHAPTER EIGHT

1052
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:09,199
We Move North
When Colleen was two years old, I got a job

1053
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:15,150
with a magazine in Pennsylvania, in the northeast
of the United States.

1054
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:18,160
We were ready for a change from Florida.

1055
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,099
There were too many people and cars.

1056
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:25,670
The weather was always hot, with a lot of
thunderstorms.

1057
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:29,660
We wanted to live in a quiet place in the
country.

1058
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:34,380
We wanted to see summer, winter, spring, and
fall.

1059
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:38,579
Most of all, we wanted to see snow.

1060
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:41,910
Our new home was very beautiful.

1061
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:47,720
There was a small river near our house and
there were woods all around it.

1062
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,049
Marley was very happy.

1063
01:03:49,049 --> 01:03:54,640
Fie loved playing in the woods, and running
after small animals.

1064
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,789
Three weeks after New Year, it snowed.

1065
01:03:57,789 --> 01:04:02,770
The children were very excited because it
was their first time.

1066
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:06,539
We put on warm jackets and ran outside.

1067
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:09,309
Marley followed us.

1068
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:11,979
Marley was very funny in the snow.

1069
01:04:11,979 --> 01:04:14,440
He fell down all the time.

1070
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,589
Snow lay on his fur and his face.

1071
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:21,499
I could only see a black nose and two brown
eyes.

1072
01:04:21,499 --> 01:04:22,499
I could read his thoughts:

1073
01:04:22,499 --> 01:04:24,339
I don't understand.

1074
01:04:24,339 --> 01:04:27,699
What's this?

1075
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:31,109
It feels so cold and wet.

1076
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:34,160
But then Marley jumped up again.

1077
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,160
He ran around the yard and jumped through
the snow.

1078
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,049
The children laughed happily, and Marley was
happy, too.

1079
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:46,309
We had a great time.

1080
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:50,440
It was almost the end of our first winter
in Pennsylvania.

1081
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,569
We were very happy in our new house.

1082
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:56,219
But Marley was nine years old now.

1083
01:04:56,219 --> 01:05:01,809
He moved more slowly and he slept for most
of the day.

1084
01:05:01,809 --> 01:05:05,900
Sometimes when I took him for a walk, he got
very tired.

1085
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:11,249
His fur in many places was gray, not yellow.

1086
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:13,400
Life with Marley wasn't easy.

1087
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,720
He cost us a lot of money.

1088
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,529
He ate a lot of food and he broke a lot of
our things.

1089
01:05:20,529 --> 01:05:21,950
We could never change him.

1090
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,619
We knew that.

1091
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,829
But he was one of our family.

1092
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:29,119
He loved us and we loved him.

1093
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,410
That spring, I said to Jenny, "Let's get some
farm animals."

1094
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,740
"OK," she said.

1095
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:41,630
"But we don't have a place for big animals.

1096
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,609
Let's get some chickens.

1097
01:05:43,609 --> 01:05:47,579
Then we can have eggs every day."

1098
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:51,109
Jenny talked to one of the moms at the children's
school.

1099
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:53,089
Donna lived on a farm.

1100
01:05:53,089 --> 01:05:56,040
She gave Jenny four baby chickens.

1101
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,789
The chickens lived in a box in the kitchen.

1102
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,829
They ate and pooped.

1103
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:06,359
Then they ate some more-and they got bigger.

1104
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:13,999
One morning, I woke up early when I heard
a call from downstairs: Cock-a-doodle-do!

1105
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:18,339
I woke Jenny up and asked, "What's that noise?"

1106
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:20,559
"Oh," she said.

1107
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,880
"I don't know."

1108
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,319
She turned over and slept.

1109
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:30,460
Every morning, the chickens made a lot of
noise.

1110
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:34,490
Sometimes they made loud noises very near
Marley.

1111
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:40,509
Marley was usually afraid of loud noises,
but he didn't move away from the chickens.

1112
01:06:40,509 --> 01:06:43,640
"That's strange," I thought.

1113
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,959
"Can't Marley hear the chickens?"

1114
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:52,459
One afternoon when Marley was asleep in the
kitchen, I walked up behind him.

1115
01:06:52,459 --> 01:06:53,459
"Marley!"

1116
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:54,910
I said.

1117
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,819
But Marley didn't move.

1118
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:58,079
"Marley!"

1119
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,670
I said again.

1120
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:00,980
Nothing.

1121
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,289
"MARLEY!"

1122
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:04,229
I shouted.

1123
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,549
Marley turned.

1124
01:07:05,549 --> 01:07:08,079
He stood up and wagged his tail.

1125
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,289
"Oh, no," I thought.

1126
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:14,279
"Marley can't hear."

1127
01:07:14,279 --> 01:07:16,729
But Marley could hear some things.

1128
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:21,709
When we put food in his bowl, he always heard
the sound of his dinner.

1129
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:24,749
He ran in from the next room.

1130
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,069
Marley was always hungry.

1131
01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:34,369
He ate four big bowls of dog food every day,
and he also ate our food.

1132
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:39,749
Labradors are big dogs, and Marley was a very
large Labrador.

1133
01:07:39,749 --> 01:07:43,190
But he never got fat.

1134
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:48,089
One day I came home from work early and I
went into the kitchen.

1135
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:49,640
Marley was there.

1136
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,319
He didn't see me and he didn't hear me.

1137
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,430
There was a sandwich on the kitchen table.

1138
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:59,670
Marley stood up and put his paws on the table.

1139
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:01,849
Then he ate the sandwich.

1140
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:05,380
"What are you doing, Marley?"

1141
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,380
I asked.

1142
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,190
"You are a bad dog."

1143
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,970
But he didn't hear me.

1144
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,249
He ate the sandwich happily.

1145
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:18,250
I put my hand on Marley's fur and he jumped.

1146
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,690
When he saw me, he lay down on the floor.

1147
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:25,040
He looked up at me and I started to laugh.

1148
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,660
I couldn't be angry with Marley.

1149
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,810
He was old now and he couldn't hear.

1150
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,910
I couldn't change him.

1151
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:38,830
The chickens weren't afraid of Marley and
he never tried to catch them.

1152
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:44,940
They walked around the yard and Marley went
with them.

1153
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,140
CHAPTER NINE

1154
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:52,290
Marley Gets Older
Jenny and I had a good life.

1155
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,060
Our children were young.

1156
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,120
We felt young, too.

1157
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,020
But when we looked at Marley, we saw many
changes.

1158
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,620
The years went past, and he was twelve years
old.

1159
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:07,790
By this time, he couldn't hear anything.

1160
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,350
His fur was gray.

1161
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:13,020
His teeth were brown.

1162
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:17,710
Late one night, I took Marley outside for
his walk before bed.

1163
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,440
It was winter and there was a cold rain.

1164
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,640
I went back into the house for my jacket.

1165
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,040
When I came out again, Marley wasn't there.

1166
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,339
I looked for him everywhere, but I couldn't
find him.

1167
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:35,440
I went back inside.

1168
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,970
Then I walked upstairs and woke up Jenny.

1169
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:42,310
"I can't find Marley," I said.

1170
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,859
"He's out there in the rain."

1171
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:50,300
Jenny pulled on her jeans and shoes and we
went outside again.

1172
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,560
I walked slowly through the woods and called
for Marley.

1173
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,470
Jenny went a different way.

1174
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,260
We were very wet and cold.

1175
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,850
"Let's go home and get warm," I said.

1176
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:07,040
"I'll get the car and come out again."

1177
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,070
We walked back to our house.

1178
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:12,120
Suddenly, we saw Marley.

1179
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,500
He stood outside the house, out of the rain.

1180
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,560
When he saw us, he was very happy.

1181
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,630
I felt angry with him, but then I was happy,
too.

1182
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,880
I brought him inside and dried him.

1183
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,920
Marley was very tired.

1184
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:34,500
He went to sleep and woke up at noon the next
day.

1185
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,710
Marley couldn't see well now.

1186
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:39,830
His fur started to fall out, too.

1187
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:44,010
Jenny cleaned the house every day, but his
hairs were everywhere.

1188
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:48,020
But Marley's biggest problem was his hips.

1189
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:51,920
They hurt him a lot and he couldn't move quickly.

1190
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,480
He couldn't climb the stairs easily.

1191
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,700
But he tried to follow us everywhere.

1192
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,810
Marley had good days and bad days.

1193
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:06,280
One spring evening, I took him for a short
walk around the yard.

1194
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,310
The night was cold and there was a light wind.

1195
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:12,110
I ran and Marley ran with me.

1196
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,110
"Marley!"

1197
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,110
I said.

1198
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:17,190
"You're a puppy again!"

1199
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,560
We ran back to the house.

1200
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,810
There were two small stairs in front of the
door.

1201
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:26,580
When Marley tried to climb the stairs, he
fell down.

1202
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:31,580
He lay on the stairs and looked sadly up at
me.

1203
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,250
Marley was too heavy for me.

1204
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:37,390
I couldn't carry him, so I had to push him
up the stairs.

1205
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:42,990
Then he stood up and went into the house.

1206
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:50,520
When I looked at Marley, I thought, "We only
have one life and it can change very quickly."

1207
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:57,240
I enjoyed my job on the magazine, but I really
wanted to work for a newspaper again.

1208
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,760
Newspapers were more exciting, and I liked
writing about big stories.

1209
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,400
I also liked getting letters and calls from
readers.

1210
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,860
A friend told me about a job on the Philadelphia
Inquirer.

1211
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,250
This was one of the best newspapers in the
United States.

1212
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,040
I wrote to the newspaper and I got the job.

1213
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,350
I was very happy.

1214
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,980
In the summer, Jenny visited her sister in
Boston.

1215
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,890
She took the children with her.

1216
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:30,890
I didn't go because I was busy with my new
job.

1217
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:37,060
Every day, I was away from home for ten or
twelve hours, so we took Marley to a vacation

1218
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,330
home for dogs.

1219
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:44,190
Some days later, an animal doctor called me
from the home.

1220
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:49,980
"I'm sorry," she said, "but Marley's very
sick.

1221
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:53,360
When he saw the other dogs, he got very excited.

1222
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,010
He ate his food too quickly.

1223
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:01,080
Then he had a bad problem with his stomach
and he almost died.

1224
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,870
He's a little better now, but it will happen
again."

1225
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,690
"Oh," I said.

1226
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,240
"What are you saying?"

1227
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,540
"Do you want us to help end Marley's life?"

1228
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,540
she said.

1229
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,450
"I'm sorry."

1230
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,350
"Oh," I said.

1231
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,830
I couldn't think.

1232
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:24,500
"I have to talk to my wife."

1233
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:29,370
I called Jenny in Boston and we had a long
conversation about Marley.

1234
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:34,060
In the end, Jenny said, "The doctor's right.

1235
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,960
We have to do the best thing for Marley."

1236
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,170
I called the doctor back.

1237
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:43,730
"Yes, Marley's a very old dog," I said.

1238
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:46,730
"Life isn't so good for him now.

1239
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:50,270
He doesn't have many teeth and he can't hear.

1240
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:52,980
His hips hurt him, too."

1241
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,690
"Yes," she said.

1242
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:57,350
"Maybe we have to put him to sleep.

1243
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:01,000
But I'll call you again in an hour."

1244
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:09,080
When the doctor called again, she said, "Marley's
a very sick dog, but he isn't getting worse."

1245
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,410
The next morning, she called again.

1246
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:14,030
"We can wait," she said.

1247
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,830
"Marley's eating.

1248
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:19,250
You can take him home tomorrow."

1249
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,030
I was very happy.

1250
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:24,960
The next evening, after work, I went to the
dogs' home.

1251
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,170
Marley was very thin and weak.

1252
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,330
I thanked the doctor.

1253
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:34,150
"Everybody here loves Marley," she said.

1254
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:37,160
One of the workers helped me put Marley into
the car.

1255
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,870
Then I drove him home.

1256
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:43,830
He couldn't climb the stairs to the bedroom
and I didn't want to leave him.

1257
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:50,480
So, that night, I put a sleeping bag on the
floor and lay down next to him.

1258
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:54,880
"Tomorrow Jenny and the children are coming
back," I said.

1259
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,940
"But tonight, Marley, it's only you and me."

1260
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:04,350
I thought about my first night with Marley,
when he was a small puppy.

1261
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:09,880
That night, he cried for his mother, and then
he slept in a box next to my bed.

1262
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,810
Now, thirteen years later, here we were again.

1263
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:20,150
I put out my hand and petted him.

1264
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:23,440
In the next weeks, Marley got a little better.

1265
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:30,021
A lot of the time, he lay on the floor in
the family room, asleep in the sun.

1266
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:33,480
But one morning, when I was in the bedroom,
I heard a noise.

1267
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,420
Then Conor shouted, "Help!

1268
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,190
Marley fell down the stairs!"

1269
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:42,670
Marley lay at the bottom of the stairs.

1270
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,370
Jenny and I ran to him.

1271
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,990
But then he got up and walked away.

1272
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:51,140
"Marley had a bad fall," I told the children.

1273
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,270
"But he's OK."

1274
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:56,600
But Marley was hurt.

1275
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:00,790
When I got home from work that evening, he
couldn't move.

1276
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,400
When he saw me, he tried to get up.

1277
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,920
But he fell down again on the floor.

1278
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:11,320
"I don't think Marley can go upstairs again,"
I said.

1279
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,090
But I was wrong.

1280
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:18,820
The next day, I was upstairs at my computer
in my bedroom when I heard a sound.

1281
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,740
I turned around.

1282
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,790
Marley stood at the bedroom door!

1283
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,150
"Marley!"

1284
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,150
I said.

1285
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,860
"What are you doing here?"

1286
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,340
I went to him and petted him.

1287
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,130
Then I looked into his eyes.

1288
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:42,440
"Marley," I said, "you're going to tell me
when it's time - right?"

1289
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,870
CHAPTER TEN

1290
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:49,820
A Great Dog
Winter arrived early that year.

1291
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,230
The children waited for the snow.

1292
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,070
"Can Marley live through another winter?"

1293
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,710
I thought.

1294
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:01,020
Jenny and I took the children to Disney World
in Florida.

1295
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:06,290
It was their first Christmas away from home
and they were very excited.

1296
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:08,770
Jenny took Marley to the animal doctors' office.

1297
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:13,290
They gave him a home there and watched him
carefully.

1298
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:16,080
We had a great family vacation.

1299
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,260
But on the way home, somebody called us from
the doctors' office.

1300
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:27,600
"Marley's very tired," she said, "and his
hips are really hurting him."

1301
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,270
The next day, Jenny went for Marley.

1302
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:35,540
He got out of the car, but he couldn't walk
into the house.

1303
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,270
He lay on the ground outside.

1304
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,040
Jenny called me at work.

1305
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,510
"I can't get Marley inside," she said.

1306
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,820
"He can't get up."

1307
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,560
I left my office and went home.

1308
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,470
When I arrived, Marley was inside the house.

1309
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,810
But he was very sick.

1310
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,770
He lay on the floor.

1311
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:01,810
For the first time in thirteen years, he didn't
get up when he saw me.

1312
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,480
His eyes followed me, but he didn't move his
head.

1313
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,770
I looked at his stomach; it was very big.

1314
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,040
I called the animal doctors.

1315
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:17,960
"Bring Marley here now," a young woman doctor
said.

1316
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,820
I looked at Jenny and she looked at me.

1317
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:25,290
"Marley has to go to the hospital," we told
the children.

1318
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:28,660
"The doctors are going to try to make him
better.

1319
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,660
But he's very sick."

1320
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:36,060
With Jenny's help, I put Marley into the back
of the car.

1321
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:37,580
He lay on the floor.

1322
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,330
I petted his head.

1323
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:45,730
"Oh, Marley," I said again and again.

1324
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:49,750
At the hospital, I helped him out of the car
and took him inside.

1325
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,150
The young doctor took him away.

1326
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:56,550
Then she came back and showed me some pictures
of the inside of Marley's stomach.

1327
01:18:56,550 --> 01:19:00,700
"I'm very sorry," she said quietly.

1328
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,100
"We can't do anything for Marley now."

1329
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,940
"I understand," I said.

1330
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,660
"Please can I say goodbye to him?"

1331
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,200
"Yes, of course," she said.

1332
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:17,650
"Have as much time with him as you want."

1333
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,170
Marley was asleep.

1334
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:23,140
I got down next to him and ran my fingers
through his fur.

1335
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,830
I held up each ear in my hands.

1336
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:28,900
I opened his mouth and looked at his teeth.

1337
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,220
Then I held up his front paw.

1338
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:36,590
"I want you to understand something, Marley,"
I said.

1339
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:40,290
"Sometimes we called you the world's worst
dog.

1340
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,780
But you're not.

1341
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:47,760
We never told you this before... but you're
a great dog, Marley.

1342
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,500
A great dog."

1343
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,600
I sat with Marley for a long time, then I
called the doctor.

1344
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,520
"I'm ready now," I said.

1345
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,650
I held Marley's head and the doctor gave Marley
something.

1346
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,010
It didn't hurt him.

1347
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,110
He died quietly.

1348
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:13,060
"I want to take Marley home," I said.

1349
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:16,390
Two people brought a large black bag out to
my car.

1350
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:21,220
Then I thanked the doctor and drove away.

1351
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:24,310
When I got home, the children were in bed.

1352
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:28,530
I put my arms around Jenny and we cried for
a long time.

1353
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:31,920
Later, we went outside.

1354
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:37,600
We took the black bag out of the car and put
it into the garage.

1355
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,760
Next morning, Jenny told the children about
Marley.

1356
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,580
They were very sad and started to cry.

1357
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:46,690
"It's OK," I said.

1358
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:51,290
"When you have a dog, this always happens.

1359
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:52,970
Dogs don't live as long as people."

1360
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:59,480
Conor made a picture and wrote a letter for
Marley:

1361
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,850
To Marley.

1362
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:03,330
I loved you all my life.

1363
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:06,250
You were always there when I wanted you.

1364
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:10,960
Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan.

1365
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,530
Colleen made a picture of a girl with a big
yellow dog.

1366
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:20,310
She wrote under the picture: I will never
forget you, Marley.

1367
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:26,310
I found a very good place for Marley, in the
ground under two big fruit trees.

1368
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:30,660
I put the black bag in the ground, and Jenny
and the children watched.

1369
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:37,540
After I finished, everybody said, "We love
you, Marley."

1370
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:42,690
Then we went back to the kitchen and told
stories about Marley.

1371
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:46,940
Sometimes we laughed and sometimes we cried.

1372
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:49,490
The next days were very difficult.

1373
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,980
The house was very quiet.

1374
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:55,470
When I came home at night, there was no Marley.

1375
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:59,660
Jenny cleaned the house, but his fur was everywhere.

1376
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:06,900
One morning, when I put on my shoes, I found
some of Marley's fur inside them.

1377
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,870
Marley was my dog for thirteen years.

1378
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:14,940
He wasn't an obedient dog, but he was important
in my life.

1379
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,830
I wanted to tell other people about him.

1380
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:22,440
So I wrote about him in my newspaper.

1381
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,120
Nobody called Marley a great dog...

1382
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,050
or a good dog, I wrote.

1383
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:29,460
He was wild and crazy.

1384
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,830
He had to leave obedience school.

1385
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,840
He chewed things, and he wasn't very intelligent.

1386
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,590
But he understood people's feelings, and he
was very good with children.

1387
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:45,360
A person can learn a lot from a dog.

1388
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,900
Because of him, I listened to my feelings.

1389
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:55,580
Because of him, I enjoyed winter sunlight
and the snow and a walk in the woods.

1390
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:59,230
Because of him, I can be a good friend.

1391
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:03,250
A dog can show us the important things in
life.

1392
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:09,930
A dog isn't interested in fast cars or big
houses or expensive clothes.

1393
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:15,970
Give a dog your love, and he will give you
his.

1394
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:19,560
Many people read about Marley in the newspaper.

1395
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,410
Animal lovers called me and wrote to me.

1396
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:25,600
They wrote to me about their love for dogs.

1397
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:30,540
They wrote about their feelings when their
dogs died.

1398
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,870
Many people wrote funny stories about their
dogs.

1399
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:38,280
Some people wrote, "Marley wasn't the worst
dog in the world.

1400
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,850
My dog's the worst dog in the world!"

1401
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,460
I began to feel better.

1402
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:48,040
I took the letters home and showed them to
Jenny.

1403
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,000
She laughed, too.

1404
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,150
Winter came to an end and it was spring.

1405
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:56,650
Our yard was full of flowers.

1406
01:23:56,650 --> 01:24:00,280
I didn't think about Marley all the time.

1407
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:05,810
When I thought about him, I usually remembered
the happy days.

1408
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:09,730
In many ways, life without a dog was easier.

1409
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:12,270
The house and the yard were clean.

1410
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:14,790
We could enjoy going out to dinner.

1411
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:18,690
But something about our family wasn't right.

1412
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:21,130
One morning, Jenny showed me the newspaper.

1413
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:25,230
"Look at this," she said.

1414
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,400
It was an ad for a dog.

1415
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,120
I saw a photo of a big yellow Labrador.

1416
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,570
I looked at the photo, then I looked again.

1417
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,460
"That's Marley!"

1418
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,530
I said.

1419
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,940
"It isn't Marley," said Jenny.

1420
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,940
"Look."

1421
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:46,380
Under the photo was the dog's name: Lucky.

1422
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,160
I read:

1423
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,370
I'm looking for a new home and a new family.

1424
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:58,510
I want a quiet home, because I'm a little
wild.

1425
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,340
We read the ad and looked at the photo again.

1426
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,780
We didn't say anything for some time.

1427
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,990
Then I said, "We can go and look at him."

1428
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,820
"Yes," said Jenny.

1429
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,050
"Why not?"

1430
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,270
- THE END -
