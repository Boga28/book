00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,100
CHAPTER ONE
Ship on the Rocks

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,090
It was the seventh day of the storm.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,740
We didn't know where we were.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,700
Everyone on the ship believed that death was
very near.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,840
My wife and my four young sons moved close
to me.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,260
'My dear children,' I said, 'I don't think
we're going to die.'

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,090
Then, above the noise of the storm, I heard
a cry: 'Land!

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,090
Land!'

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,160
And the ship hit the rocks.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,190
We heard someone shout, 'There's no hope now.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,550
Let down the boats.'

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,329
'No hope!'

13
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,120
cried the children.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,890
'Be brave, my boys,' I said.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,510
'The land isn't far away.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,970
We'll save ourselves - we'll find a way.

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,070
I'll see what we can do.'

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,049
I left our room and looked around, but there
were no sailors on the ship.

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,619
They were all in boats on the sea.

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,170
We were alone!

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,590
I returned to my family.

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,350
'It's all right,' I said.

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,799
'The front part of the ship is between two
rocks, so it's above the water.

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,539
Tomorrow the sea will be calmer and we'll
be able to reach the land.'

25
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:33,950
The children immediately became happier, but
my wife understood the danger of our position.

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:44,060
She prepared a meal and the boys went to bed,
but my wife and I stayed awake and watched.

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,020
The next day, it was not as windy and the
sky was clear.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,090
We could see that we were near land.

29
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,850
'Now,' I said, 'let's go round the ship.

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,969
Let's look for things that will help us to
reach the land.

31
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,020
We need food and water too.

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,179
Then we'll meet again here.'

33
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:10,579
Fritz, my oldest boy, brought back guns and
gunpowder.

34
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:18,700
My second son, Ernest, found a box of tools,
a lot of nails, a big knife, some small knives

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,610
and some other things.

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,280
The box was very heavy, but Fritz helped him
with it.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,560
When my third son, Jack, opened the door to
one of the rooms, two big dogs jumped out

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,590
at him.

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,939
They were quite friendly and he brought them
with him.

40
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,819
Then my wife came with Franz, our youngest
son.

41
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,510
'Good news,' she said.

42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,570
'A donkey, two goats, a pig, six sheep and
some chickens are still alive.'

43
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,319
I said, 'Those will all be useful - but not
the dogs.

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,680
They'll eat too much.'

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,579
'But Father,' said Jack, 'they'll help us
to catch animals for food when we reach the

46
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:08,579
land.'

47
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,599
'Yes,' I said, 'but we haven't reached it
yet.

48
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,209
We need to make a boat.

49
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,959
Let's get some barrels and some pieces of
wood.'

50
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,329
So we started to work and we made a boat.

51
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,150
We used one of the pieces of wood to hold
the sail.

52
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,249
At last everything was ready, and we lowered
the boat into the sea.

53
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:42,129
It was too late to leave the ship that night
so I tied one end of a long rope to our boat

54
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,940
and the other end to the ship.

55
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,400
Then we had a meal and went to bed.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,859
CHAPTER TWO
The Island

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,159
We all woke up early the next morning.

58
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,739
I called the children together and said, 'First,
we must feed the animals.

59
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,569
I hope we'll be able to come back for them
later.

60
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,730
Then let's take everything that will be useful
to us.'

61
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,770
We took guns and gunpowder, and bags of food.

62
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,500
We took some cooking pots, the tools, nails
and knives.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,980
We brought sailcloth to make a tent.

64
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,699
The chickens seemed sad, so we brought them
too.

65
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:32,210
'The dogs,' I said, 'can swim behind the boat.'

66
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,680
At the last minute my wife came, carrying
a big bag.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,340
I didn't ask her what was in it.

68
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:48,699
At first, the boat turned round and round,
but after a time I learned to sail it.

69
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,699
'Look!'

70
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,280
cried Fritz, as we came nearer the land.

71
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,289
'Those are coconuts.

72
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:58,750
We'll have coconuts to eat.'

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,949
The dogs were swimming towards calmer water.

74
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,690
'They know the best place to land,' I said.

75
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,500
'I'll follow them.'

76
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,830
Three of the boys jumped on to the beach.

77
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,550
Then they helped Franz to follow them.

78
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,330
We took everything out of the boat and freed
the chickens.

79
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,710
Then I cut some wood from the trees, put it
in the ground and made a tent from the sailcloth.

80
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:33,310
'Now,' I said to the children, 'go and bring
some dry grass for our beds.'

81
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,129
While they were doing this, I found some big
stones for a fireplace.

82
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:43,450
I soon made a good fire, using dry wood from
the beach.

83
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,920
My wife got a pot of water from the river
and put it on the fire.

84
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,940
Then, helped by little Franz, she began to
cook a meal.

85
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,720
Fritz took a gun to the other side of the
river.

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,620
Ernest went to the right along the beach and
Jack went to the left.

87
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,770
Suddenly, I heard Jack shouting.

88
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,310
I took a gun and ran to help him.

89
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,400
I found him standing in water up to his knees.

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,220
'Come here, Father,' he shouted.

91
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,460
'Come quickly.

92
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,560
I've caught something really big!'

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,080
'All right,' I said, 'bring it here.'

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,650
'I can't.

95
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,020
It's caught me.'

96
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,599
I laughed.

97
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,630
Then I hit the large shellfish with my gun
and freed Jack.

98
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,280
It was only holding on to his clothing, so
he wasn't hurt.

99
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,550
'Well, Jack,' I said, 'you've caught our first
fresh food.'

100
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,650
Just then, Ernest came.

101
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,900
'I've found some things that are good to eat
too.

102
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,090
But I need help to get them.'

103
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,010
'What are they?'

104
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,939
'They're shellfish too, but I can't get them
off the rocks.

105
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,389
We'll take them later, after our meal.'

106
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:09,110
'The food's ready,' said my wife, 'but we
should wait for Fritz.'

107
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,000
She looked at her pot.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,650
'How shall we eat it?

109
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,470
We can't eat soup with a knife!

110
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,810
We need spoons, but we haven't got any!'

111
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,199
'We can cut coconuts in half and use them.'

112
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,050
'We can, but we haven't got any coconuts,'
I said.

113
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,030
'There are the shells on the rocks!' said
Ernest.

114
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,110
'We can use them if you help me.'

115
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,970
Fritz arrived, so the boys all went to get
the shellfish.

116
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,520
When they came back, Jack tried to open one
with a knife.

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,889
'I can't do it!' he said.

118
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,979
'I can't open it.'

119
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:57,030
'Put them near the hot fire,' I said, 'and
they'll open without your help.'

120
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,790
So we sat down to our meal.

121
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,379
We ate the shellfish first, and then we used
the shells as spoons for the soup.

122
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:11,460
'But we haven't got any plates!' said my wife.

123
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,139
'I've got a plate,' said Ernest, showing her
a very big shell.

124
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,940
'I found it on the beach.

125
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,620
There are lots of these shells near the place
where I found this one.'

126
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,969
'Then why,' I asked, 'didn't you bring plates
for all of us?'

127
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,810
The sun was going down when we finished our
meal.

128
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:38,580
Then my wife opened her bag from the ship
and began to throw corn to the chickens.

129
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,140
I stopped her.

130
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,030
'I'm very glad that you've brought this.

131
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,400
But we mustn't give it to the chickens.

132
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
We must plant it.

133
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,880
Then, when it grows, we can make bread.

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,930
The chickens can have other food.'

135
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,040
It was time for everyone to go to bed.

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,110
We took our guns with us into the tent.

137
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,760
CHAPTER THREE
The Baby Monkey

138
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,670
We woke up very early the next day.

139
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:18,870
'First,' I said, 'we must see if any of the
sailors from the ship have reached land.'

140
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,500
'We don't all need to go,' said my wife.

141
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
'You take Fritz.

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,140
I'll stay here with the other boys.'

143
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,070
'Yes,' I answered, 'I'll take Turk with us,
and Flora can stay with you.'

144
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,500
Those were the names of our dogs.

145
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,280
My wife gave us bags of food to take with
us.

146
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,630
We walked along the beach, looking in the
sand for signs of other people.

147
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,690
But we didn't find any.

148
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,330
Fritz had a gun with him.

149
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,240
'Shall I use the gun?' he asked.

150
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,050
'If they're near, they'll hear it.'

151
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,050
'No!'

152
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,050
I said.

153
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,230
'If there are wild men on the island, they
will hear it too.

154
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,830
We don't want them to know we're here.'

155
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,500
We turned away from the beach and walked for
about a mile.

156
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,440
We came to a little wood.

157
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,870
At every step, we saw a new and beautiful
plant.

158
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:30,410
'What's this strange plant,' asked Fritz,
'with these big things growing on it?'

159
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,890
'Ah,' I said, 'those are gourds.

160
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,590
They're very useful.'

161
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,660
We took some of the gourds and cut them open.

162
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,880
'Now we must take out the soft part, inside.

163
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,250
We'll leave the shells to dry in the sun.

164
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,130
Then we can make spoons and plates and cooking
pots from them.

165
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,340
That's why these plants are so useful.'

166
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,570
'I don't understand how you can make a cooking
pot from this.

167
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,870
If you put it on the fire, it'll burn.'

168
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,850
'Ah,' I said, 'but you don't put it on the
fire.

169
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,870
You fill it with water.

170
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:15,000
Then you put hot stones into the water, and
the water will boil.'

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,580
We cut plates and spoons and pots from the
gourds, and put them in the sun.

172
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,820
We left signs to ourselves around the place,
so we could find it again later.

173
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,140
We walked to a field of very tall grass.

174
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,550
It was growing high above our heads.

175
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:40,700
'Now where,' I thought, 'have I seen grass
like this?'

176
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,900
We had to cut our way through the grass.

177
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,600
As I touched it, my hands became very wet.

178
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
I put a hand to my mouth - then I remembered!

179
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,930
'Come here, Fritz.

180
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,070
Cut one of these open and put the soft part
in your mouth.'

181
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,460
He did that.

182
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,230
'Oh!' he said.

183
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,090
'It's sweet.

184
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,090
Like sugar!'

185
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,180
'It is sugar,' I answered.

186
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,940
'Let's take some back with us.

187
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,540
The others will be very pleased and surprised.'

188
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,980
Next, we came to some coconut trees.

189
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,730
As we moved nearer, we saw a lot of monkeys
on the ground near the trees.

190
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,430
But when they saw us, they ran up into the
trees.

191
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,340
They made angry noises at us.

192
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,570
Fritz lifted his gun.

193
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,570
'Stop!'

194
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,570
I cried.

195
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,960
'Why do you want to kill those monkeys?'

196
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,890
'Because they're screaming at us.

197
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,410
They're terrible, useless things.'

198
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,000
'Or perhaps they're laughing at you.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,100
Why are you getting so angry because they're
laughing at you?

200
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,750
They're right to laugh at an angry boy.

201
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,600
And they aren't useless.'

202
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,730
'How can you make a monkey useful?'

203
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,640
Fritz asked.

204
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,940
I threw some stones at the monkeys in the
trees, and the monkeys threw coconuts down

205
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,300
at us.

206
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,540
'There!'

207
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
I said.

208
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,560
'An angry monkey can be quite useful.'

209
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,450
'More useful than an angry boy?' said Fritz.

210
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,110
'But I'm not angry now.

211
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll carry the coconuts.'

212
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,740
We came to more coconut trees, and the dog,
Turk, ran in front of us.

213
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,800
We heard cries of pain, and angry cries from
the monkeys up in the trees.

214
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,610
We saw that Turk had one of the monkeys in
his mouth.

215
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,190
Fritz ran to save it.

216
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,890
But it was too late - the monkey was dead.

217
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,330
Its baby wasn't far away.

218
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,360
It was in the grass, crying out in fear.

219
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,860
Then a very strange thing happened.

220
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,810
The baby monkey jumped on to Fritz's back
and held on to his hair.

221
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,320
'Take it off!

222
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,990
Take it off!'

223
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,370
cried Fritz.

224
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,750
I laughed.

225
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,510
'It's lost its mother, and so you've become
its father.

226
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,370
Yes, it's very similar to its new father!'

227
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,960
I carefully took the monkey off Fritz's back
and held it in my arms.

228
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,470
'What shall we do with it?'

229
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,750
I asked.

230
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,930
'Can I take it home?'

231
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,290
cried Fritz.

232
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,610
'I'll get milk for it from the goats on the
ship, and soon it will learn to find food

233
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,860
for itself.'

234
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,900
We returned to the beach, and my wife and
the three other boys ran to meet us.

235
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,960
They were very pleased to see the little monkey.

236
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,870
'What are those sticks?'

237
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,320
they asked.

238
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,660
'They're for you to eat,' said Fritz, and
he gave the sugar to his brothers.

239
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,810
A very good meal was waiting for us at the
tent.

240
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,610
Different sorts of fish and a bird were cooking
over the fire.

241
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,040
Franz caught the fish while we were away.

242
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Ernest caught the bird.

243
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,410
The fish was very nice, but we didn't like
the taste of Ernest's bird.

244
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,030
The sun was going down when we finished our
meal.

245
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:37,160
We all went to bed - Fritz took the little
monkey with him.

246
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,530
CHAPTER FOUR
Back to the Ship

247
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:47,540
When I woke up, I said to my wife, 'I don't
know what to do first.

248
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,390
There are so many things that we need to do.'

249
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,990
'First,' she said, 'you must bring those animals
from the ship.

250
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,170
Go with Fritz.

251
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,950
The rest of us will look for a place where
we can build a home.'

252
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,370
I said to her, 'We'll have to stay on the
ship all night.

253
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,760
Tell Ernest to climb up that high tree.

254
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,120
He should tie a piece of cloth to the top.

255
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,660
If there's any danger, pull the cloth down.'

256
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,150
'And you must put up a light in the ship,'
said my wife.

257
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,980
'Then I'll know that you've got there safely.'

258
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,490
We reached the ship quite easily.

259
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,830
The animals were in good health and had enough
food.

260
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,180
I remembered my wife's words and put up a
light.

261
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,240
Then we had some food and went to sleep.

262
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,230
We woke up very early the next morning.

263
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,630
We found useful things for our life on the
island.

264
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,840
'We must have plenty of gunpowder,' said Fritz.

265
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,270
'Then we'll be safe if we meet wild animals
or enemies.

266
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,510
Later, we'll need...'

267
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,710
'We must think of the present,' I said.

268
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,500
'What do we need now, for these next few days
or weeks?

269
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,839
We must take more sailcloth because we need
to make a home.

270
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,120
And we must think of food.

271
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,959
What food is there on the ship?'

272
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,490
'I've seen a barrel of butter,' said Fritz,
'and there's the ship's bread, and some meat

273
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,589
in salt.

274
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,639
But what will we do when the bread's finished?

275
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,769
And the butter will soon go bad.'

276
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:32,059
'Let's think of the present,' I said.

277
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,409
'We have enough problems to worry about now.

278
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,660
We can think about the future later.

279
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,200
Perhaps a ship will come and take us away.'

280
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,659
But I was wrong.

281
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,679
It's always a good idea to prepare for the
future.

282
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,241
We didn't know that at the time.

283
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:54,030
So we made some silly mistakes.

284
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,799
We didn't take back things that we needed
later.

285
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,190
It was a slow job, getting all these things
together.

286
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,750
So we had to spend a second night on the ship.

287
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,919
We woke up late the next morning.

288
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:16,120
'Now, Fritz,' I said, as we sat at breakfast,
'how can we take these animals to the land?'

289
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,980
'We can't put them in the boat,' he said.

290
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,600
'They're too heavy.

291
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,730
Can we make another boat?

292
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,090
No, the animals are too big.

293
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,909
What can we do?

294
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,360
The pig can swim, but the goats and the donkey
can't swim so far.'

295
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,799
'No,' I said, 'we can't make a boat that's
big enough.

296
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,830
There are a lot of barrels on the ship - enough
for a bigger boat.

297
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,950
But we haven't got time to make one.'

298
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,110
'Barrels!'

299
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,110
cried Fritz.

300
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,679
'Let's make a boat for each animal.

301
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,790
Let's tie barrels to the animals.

302
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,340
The barrels will hold them up above the water
when we pull them behind the boat!'

303
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,129
'That's possible,' I said.

304
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:06,460
'Let's try first with one animal and see.'

305
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,860
We tied a barrel to each side of a sheep and
put it into the sea.

306
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,650
It went down and down...!

307
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,730
Then finally I saw its head above the water,
and it began to swim.

308
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,230
When it was tired, it stopped swimming.

309
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,500
It stayed there, held up by the barrels.

310
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,460
Fritz jumped into the sea and tied a rope
to the sheep, and we pulled it back into the

311
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,169
ship.

312
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:40,490
We worked very hard and for a time the job
seemed impossible.

313
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,380
The pig and the donkey were the most difficult.

314
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,130
'Perhaps we should leave them,' said Fritz.

315
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,450
'We need the goats more than the other animals.'

316
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:57,710
We tied barrels to the goats, and then we
tried again with the pig and the donkey.

317
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:03,080
The donkey seemed to understand, but the pig
gave us a lot of trouble.

318
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,100
'The pig's very fat,' said Fritz, 'and pigs
are good swimmers.

319
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,620
Perhaps its fat will keep it up in the water.'

320
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,120
So we didn't tie barrels to the pig.

321
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,960
At last, we got all the animals into the water.

322
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
Then we climbed into the boat and put up the
sail.

323
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,630
There was a strong wind, and we soon reached
the land.

324
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,309
I cut the barrels from the animals, and they
came up on to the beach.

325
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,539
They were glad to be on land again.

326
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,240
My wife and the boys came running.

327
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,500
My wife was surprised to see all the animals,
even the pig, safe on the land.

328
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,279
'How did you think of using the barrels?'

329
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,299
she asked.

330
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,250
'I didn't think of it,' I answered.

331
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:00,450
'This was Fritz's plan, not mine.'

332
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,760
CHAPTER FIVE
A New Place

333
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:11,120
'What did you do, my dear, while Fritz and
I were on the ship?'

334
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I asked.

335
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,120
'I found a place for our new home,' said my
wife.

336
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,830
'It was impossible to stay in the tent because
it was so hot.

337
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,210
And there are no trees here that we can sit
under.

338
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,880
So Ernest and Jack took their guns, and we
took enough food with us for the day.

339
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,860
The dogs came too.

340
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,980
'We came to a river and crossed it on stones.

341
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,029
Then we walked up to higher ground.

342
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:44,200
From there, I could see a small group of ten
or twelve trees.

343
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,870
They were the biggest trees that I've ever
seen.

344
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,950
We stopped and ate our lunch there.

345
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,539
It seemed to me to be the perfect place to
live.

346
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,730
'There!

347
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,870
Now you know my story!

348
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,120
I went to look for a new place to live, and
I found one.

349
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,179
Promise me that we'll go there tomorrow.

350
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,150
We'll make a home for ourselves in one of
those big trees.'

351
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,559
'What!'

352
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,910
I said, laughing.

353
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,590
'In a tree?

354
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,730
A tree house!

355
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:22,340
We can live under a tree, but how can we get
up into the tree?

356
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,870
Fly?'

357
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,249
'You can laugh if you want to.

358
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:30,570
But I'm sure that we can build a small hut
in the branches.

359
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,049
We'll think of a way to get up there.'

360
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,159
'Right,' I said.

361
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,600
'We'll all go and see the place tomorrow.

362
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,190
Then we'll think about what we can do.'

363
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,190
***

364
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,830
During the night, I thought about our conversation.

365
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:54,419
Then, as we sat at breakfast the next day,
I said, 'Yes, we'll move to the place that

366
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,029
you saw on the other side of the river.'

367
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:04,140
I turned to the boys and said, 'Now, what's
the first thing that we must do?'

368
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,820
'I know!' said Jack.

369
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,380
'We must move the tent there and then take
all our things and the animals.'

370
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,450
'What do you think, Fritz?'

371
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,169
'The place is on the other side of the river.

372
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:23,120
Mother, Ernest, Jack and Franz went across
on stones.

373
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,260
But the donkey and pig can't cross on those
stones, and we can't carry our things across

374
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,279
the water.

375
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,279
We must build a bridge.

376
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,120
That's the first thing, isn't it?'

377
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
'No,' said Ernest.

378
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,740
'First, we must go out to the ship and bring
back wood for the bridge.'

379
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,190
'We don't have to do that,' said Jack.

380
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,090
'There was a lot of wood on the beach where
that shellfish caught me.

381
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,889
It's come from other ships, and there will
be more there now.'

382
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:55,139
'Good boy!'

383
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,379
I said.

384
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:58,850
'Let's see what we can find.'

385
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,940
Jack was right.

386
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,419
We found plenty of wood.

387
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,320
We tied together the big pieces which were
useful to us.

388
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,999
We pulled them to the mouth of the river.

389
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:15,870
Then we got the donkey and, with its help,
we pulled the pieces of wood up the river.

390
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:21,480
Finally, they were at the place where we wanted
to build our bridge.

391
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,509
It wasn't easy, but we put three long pieces
across the river.

392
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,759
Then we nailed more wood across them.

393
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,230
It was very hard work, and we all slept well
that night.

394
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:40,539
The next morning, we got up early and began
preparing for our journey.

395
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:47,779
We put our pots, food and smaller things into
bags and hung them on each side of the donkey.

396
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:53,910
We put little bags on the goats, but the pig
refused to carry anything.

397
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,500
Franz sat on the back of the donkey, so it
could not run away.

398
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,100
The boys and I carried the other things that
we needed for the first few days in our new

399
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,850
home.

400
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,159
When we were all ready, my wife said, 'We
can't leave the chickens here.

401
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,889
If we leave them, we'll lose them all.'

402
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,970
Fritz and Ernest tried to catch the chickens,
but it was impossible.

403
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,519
They ran away.

404
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,720
'I'll show you how to do it,' my wife said.

405
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,760
She threw a little corn on the ground, and
all the chickens ran to it.

406
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,519
When she threw some more inside the tent,
they all went inside.

407
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,460
Then, while they were eating, she closed the
tent.

408
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,870
'Now, Jack, you go into the tent.

409
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,610
Catch the birds and pass them out to us.

410
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,350
We'll tie their legs and put them in two barrels
on the donkey's back.'

411
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,350
***

412
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,360
At last, we were ready to start.

413
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,669
We put our other things inside the tent and
closed it carefully.

414
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:06,480
Fritz and my wife went in front.

415
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,380
Next came the donkey, with Franz on its back,
then Jack with the goats.

416
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,899
The monkey rode on the goat that gave him
his milk.

417
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:23,440
After him came Ernest and the sheep, and I
came last.

418
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,059
The dogs helped us to keep all the animals
in line.

419
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,480
The pig did not want to come with us, so we
left it behind.

420
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,080
But when it saw us leaving, it came running
after us.

421
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,840
When we reached the bridge, it was there too!

422
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,539
We crossed the bridge very carefully.

423
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,789
I was worried about the weight of the donkey,
so I went first.

424
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,450
The bridge was all right, so the donkey went
next.

425
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,960
Then the rest followed.

426
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,590
But not the pig!

427
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,590
Oh no!

428
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,669
The pig refused to go on to the bridge.

429
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:07,450
We tried everything, but without success.

430
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,220
Then, when we were all on the other side,
the pig swam across.

431
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,039
It followed us.

432
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,720
So we reached the place where we wanted to
make our new home.

433
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,870
'These are wonderful trees!' said Fritz.

434
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,440
'They're so tall!'

435
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,980
'Yes,' I said, 'I didn't think they were as
big as this.

436
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,799
This is an excellent place.

437
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:41,059
If we can make a house in one of these trees,
we'll be safe from wild animals.'

438
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:46,260
We tied up the animals so they couldn't escape
- but not the pig.

439
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,899
The pig lay down and slept.

440
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:59,239
We freed the chickens, and my wife started
a fire and cooked a meal for us.

441
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:01,629
CHAPTER SIX
The Rope Ladder

442
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:08,419
After the meal, I said, 'We must sleep on
the ground tonight.

443
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:13,279
I can't see how we can get up into a tree
this evening.'

444
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,460
Then I went to the beach with Fritz and Ernest.

445
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,429
We looked for the things that we needed for
a ladder.

446
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:25,820
The beach was covered with pieces of wood
of all sizes, carried there from ships by

447
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,279
the sea.

448
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,720
'It'll be difficult to make a ladder out of
these pieces of wood,' said Fritz.

449
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,389
'And it'll be very heavy.'

450
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:38,549
'Look at those tall thick plants there!'

451
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:39,640
cried Ernest.

452
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,039
'They're what we need!

453
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,419
Bamboo!'

454
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,169
I cut some bamboo into pieces about six feet
long.

455
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:50,500
Then I tied them together, so I could carry
them.

456
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,559
Then I cut some straight sticks.

457
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,379
'I can make a bow with this bamboo,' I said.

458
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:01,429
'And arrows from these sticks.'

459
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:05,539
We went back to the biggest tree, carrying
the bamboo.

460
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,580
We put it on the ground.

461
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,629
'That branch is about thirty feet high,' I
said.

462
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:17,909
'We've got more than sixty feet of thick rope
and a lot of thin rope.

463
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:24,380
Now we'll put two long pieces of rope on the
ground and we'll cut pieces of bamboo a foot

464
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,580
and a half long.

465
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,059
Fritz, you cut the pieces.

466
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,169
Ernest will help me with the rope.'

467
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,049
So we began to work.

468
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:41,549
'Now,' I said, 'we must tie pieces of bamboo
across the ropes to make steps.

469
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:45,330
Then we'll have a rope ladder.'

470
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:51,580
We worked very hard, and after a few hours
our ladder was ready.

471
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,759
Then I made a bow from another piece of bamboo.

472
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,759
'Ernest,' I said, 'make arrows from these
sticks.

473
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,360
Put a big nail in one end.'

474
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,409
'Oh!' cried Jack.

475
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:06,110
'A bow and arrows!

476
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,279
What are you going to do with them?

477
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,639
I want to play with them!'

478
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:13,710
'I'm not making a toy, Jack.

479
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,629
I'm going to shoot with this.

480
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:23,600
But soon you'll all have bows and arrows,
because we must be careful with our gunpowder.

481
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,360
When we've used this gunpowder, we won't be
able to get any more.

482
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,320
And, if there are dangerous men on the island,
we'll need our gunpowder.'

483
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,320
When the bow and arrows were ready, I tied
a long piece of thin rope to an arrow and

484
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,200
shot the arrow up over the branch.

485
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,870
It came down on the other side, carrying the
thin rope with it.

486
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:54,309
'Ah!' said Ernest - he always understood things
quickly.

487
00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:00,700
'You'll tie the rope ladder to this thin rope
and pull it up on to the branch.

488
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,659
Then you'll hold it there while someone ties
it to the branch.'

489
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,390
'Yes,' I said.

490
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,390
'You climb up there.

491
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,220
You're smaller than Fritz.

492
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:15,029
And I don't think Jack can tie the ladder
well enough.'

493
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:17,830
Soon the ladder was tied to the branch.

494
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,120
'That's a good day's work,' I said.

495
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,120
'Now we must tie up the animals, and we'll
sleep at the foot of the tree.

496
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,799
Tomorrow we'll begin to build our tree house.'

497
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,539
'Look!' said Jack.

498
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,960
'The chickens are on our rope ladder.'

499
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,770
I looked.

500
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,070
Each chicken was sitting on a step.

501
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,649
They were already very comfortable.

502
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:49,239
I lit a big fire to keep away dangerous animals.

503
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:56,429
Then I decided to stay awake and watch.

504
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:01,090
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Tree House

505
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,690
I was worried, at first.

506
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,999
I didn't feel that we were in a very safe
place.

507
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:10,149
I heard a strange sound...

508
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:14,960
No, it was only the movement of the trees.

509
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,989
The fire was getting low...

510
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:20,759
What were those shadows?

511
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,960
Was that a wild animal moving nearer... nearer?

512
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,419
I got up and put more wood on the fire.

513
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:35,799
At last, I felt safer and went to sleep.

514
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,080
It was light when I woke up.

515
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,090
All the others were already awake.

516
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,230
We had breakfast, and then we started work
again.

517
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,340
My wife milked the goats.

518
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:54,619
Then she went down to the beach with Ernest,
Jack, Franz and the donkey to get wood for

519
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:57,070
the tree house.

520
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:02,440
Fritz and I climbed up the ladder into the
tree, and planned our new home.

521
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:09,039
'These branches,' I said, 'are thick and close
together, and they come straight out from

522
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,840
the tree.

523
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,399
The floor of the house can be here, and the
tree will be one of the walls.'

524
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:23,779
Fritz looked up and said, 'Those higher branches
will hold up the roof.

525
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:26,190
But what sort of roof?'

526
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:33,549
'We'll put a sail over the branches and bring
it down to the floor on two sides.'

527
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:38,850
That, as you will hear later, was a great
mistake.

528
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,190
I was very stupid!

529
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,690
But at the time, Fritz and I were very pleased
with our simple plans.

530
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,590
'This fourth side,' I said, ' will be open.

531
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,239
We can look out from there.

532
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,940
Perhaps we'll make a place where we can sit
outside in the daytime.'

533
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,529
'It'll be a beautiful house!' said Fritz.

534
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:05,410
Then my wife and Ernest arrived.

535
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,110
The donkey was pulling a lot of wood behind
it.

536
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,960
More wood was tied on its back, and Franz
was sitting on top of that.

537
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,750
They left the wood and went back for more.

538
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,929
'How shall we get it up here?' said Fritz.

539
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,419
'Shall I carry it up the ladder?'

540
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:28,350
'No, we must pull it up.

541
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,830
Now where did I see...?

542
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,690
Yes, I remember.

543
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,910
It was in Ernest's box of tools.'

544
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,370
Fritz found the little wheel.

545
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,240
We tied it to a branch and pulled up the pieces
of wood.

546
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,750
Then I started to make the floor.

547
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,750
***

548
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,590
When evening came, the floor was finished.

549
00:34:53,590 --> 00:35:01,140
We hung our sailcloth over the higher branches
and nailed it down to the floor on two sides.

550
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,780
On the fourth side, we could see across the
country round us, and plenty of air could

551
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,740
come into the house.

552
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
'There!'

553
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,930
I said.

554
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,010
'Our house is finished.'

555
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,810
Then I saw that there were more pieces of
wood.

556
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,850
'We'll make a table and some chairs from these
tomorrow.

557
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,480
Tonight we'll sleep in our new house.'

558
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,600
The three older boys quickly went up the ladder,
carrying everything for their beds.

559
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,090
My wife was afraid of the ladder, but she
reached the top safely.

560
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,080
Then I took Franz on my back.

561
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,950
I untied the ladder from the posts in the
ground, climbed up and pulled the ladder up

562
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,450
after me.

563
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,060
'Now we're safe in our Tree House,' said Jack.

564
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,070
'Nothing can climb up here!'

565
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,380
'Oh!' cried Fritz.

566
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,080
'Where's the monkey?'

567
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,160
'There!' said Ernest, pointing to Fritz's
bed.

568
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,930
'A monkey can climb up anywhere!'

569
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,340
I kept my gun by my side.

570
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,410
I was still not sure that the animals below
were safe.

571
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,920
But the night passed quietly.

572
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,471
CHAPTER EIGHT
Back to the Tent

573
00:36:24,471 --> 00:36:30,660
After breakfast, Fritz and I started to make
a table.

574
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,760
Suddenly, we heard a loud BANG, and a small
bird fell almost at our feet.

575
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,110
'That was a good shot!' said Ernest, picking
it up.

576
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,270
He was very proud.

577
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,360
'It wasn't good,' I said.

578
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,660
'We can't use our gunpowder like that.

579
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,830
We can use the guns to shoot large animals
for food.

580
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:00,760
But for birds and small animals, we must use
bows and arrows.

581
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,260
Look at the bow and arrow that I've made,
Ernest.

582
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,300
Try to make better ones - and learn to use
them.'

583
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
***

584
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,800
When midday came, we put some barrels round
the new table.

585
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,210
We were ready to eat our first meal at it.

586
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,140
'Where are Ernest and Jack?' asked my wife.

587
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,880
'Let's start.

588
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,880
If they come late, they won't have any lunch.'

589
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,140
'Maybe something has happened to them,' said
my wife.

590
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,740
'I can't eat if they're not here.'

591
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,040
We waited.

592
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,460
'I'm sure nothing has happened to them,' I
said at last.

593
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,910
'They're young and silly and don't notice
the time.

594
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,770
Put the food on the table.'

595
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,050
Then Ernest and Jack arrived, carrying bows
and arrows.

596
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,670
'Look!' said Jack, before I could speak.

597
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,600
He held out two very small birds.

598
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,030
'We shot them with our bows and arrows!'

599
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,460
'I'm very pleased about that.

600
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,560
But I'm angry because you're late.

601
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,850
Your mother's been worried about you.

602
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,220
Sit down and eat your lunch.'

603
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,750
We only had meat and a little bread for lunch.

604
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,080
The bread was very hard.

605
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,490
The meat was an animal that I shot the day
before.

606
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,280
'I left some things at the tent,' said my
wife.

607
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,370
'If we get them, I can give you better meals.'

608
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,290
***

609
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,300
We left and walked towards the beach.

610
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,990
The dogs went in front; this time, the little
monkey was riding on Turk's back.

611
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:51,090
Then came Fritz, Ernest and Jack with their
bows and arrows.

612
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:55,640
My wife and Franz and I came last.

613
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,640
There was still a lot of wood on the beach,
and I noticed two long pieces, just the same

614
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
shape.

615
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,580
Their ends were turned up.

616
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,680
'Now where,' I thought, 'have I seen pieces
of wood shaped like that?

617
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Ah!

618
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,760
I remember!

619
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,500
In Switzerland, of course!'

620
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,890
We reached the tent and found everything in
the same place as before.

621
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,160
Everyone looked for the things that they wanted.

622
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,460
Fritz got some gunpowder, while I found the
butter.

623
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,230
My wife pointed to a bag that I remembered
putting into our boat.

624
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,140
'What is it?'

625
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,410
I asked.

626
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,410
'Ah!'

627
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,410
she said.

628
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,290
'That's what I wanted for our lunch.

629
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,560
Potatoes!'

630
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,620
'There are only enough for one meal,' I said.

631
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:55,440
'But if we plant them, we'll have plenty next
year - enough for all our meals.'

632
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,330
Jack was listening to this.

633
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:03,850
'We can eat these potatoes and then we can
find wild potatoes,' he said.

634
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,390
'You found sugar and coconuts.'

635
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,470
'No, Jack.

636
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,790
Wild potatoes grow on the top of high mountains.

637
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,100
And they're very small and not very good to
eat.

638
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,390
These potatoes are different from wild ones.

639
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,370
We must make a garden and grow potatoes in
it.'

640
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,140
'But what can we eat now?' asked Jack.

641
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,750
'I'll see what I can find,' I answered, 'until
our garden's ready.

642
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,360
There are some wild plants that we can use.'

643
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,740
Next, Fritz and I went to get salt.

644
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,150
The sea water dried on the rocks and left
salt behind.

645
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,670
We were able to get enough to give our food
some taste.

646
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:57,040
But we were stupid not to take more than that!

647
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,730
CHAPTER NINE
The Sledge

648
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:07,890
Later in bed, I thought, 'That barrel of butter
was very heavy.

649
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,930
We must find a way to carry heavy things.'

650
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:16,060
I thought about our animals, tied up at the
foot of the tree at night.

651
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,520
They weren't safe.

652
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,220
We must make huts for them.

653
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,750
We needed wood for this, but more than we
used for the floor of our house.

654
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,660
We also needed bamboo.

655
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,930
The donkey couldn't carry so much, so we must
make a sledge.

656
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:41,270
Those two pieces of wood on the beach were
just the right shape for the bottom of a sledge.

657
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,560
So early in the morning, Ernest and I climbed
quietly down the ladder.

658
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,750
I took some tools, nails and a piece of light
rope.

659
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:57,230
We found the two pieces of wood, and nailed
them together with smaller pieces.

660
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,820
Then we put a lot of bamboo and wood across
the top.

661
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:07,280
I tied a rope on the front, and we pulled
the sledge back along the beach.

662
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,520
It moved very easily across the sand.

663
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
***

664
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,420
When we were finishing our breakfast, we heard
a loud noise from the chickens.

665
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,060
We all ran to them.

666
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,100
'It's the monkey!'

667
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,100
cried Ernest, 'He's running after them.'

668
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,480
Then we saw the monkey hiding behind a tree.

669
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,290
He was eating an egg.

670
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,380
The monkey ran away to another tree, and Ernest
ran after him.

671
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,080
Soon Ernest came back with four more eggs.

672
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,460
My wife went and looked in the grass.

673
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,920
'One of the chickens is sitting on her eggs,'
she said.

674
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,180
'Soon we'll have some little ones.

675
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,240
We must make a safe place for the chickens.

676
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,130
Then we can keep the monkey away from them.'

677
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,130
***

678
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:03,980
After lunch, Ernest and I went out again with
the donkey.

679
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,180
The donkey pulled the sledge to the beach.

680
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,470
We put more wood and bamboo on the sledge,
and then I looked at the sky.

681
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,360
'We must go home,' I said.

682
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,770
'There are clouds in the sky, and the wind
is getting stronger.'

683
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:25,300
Then I looked at the place where the ship
was still on the rocks.

684
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,140
Another storm could carry the rest of it away.

685
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:34,310
We must make one more journey to the ship
before it broke into pieces.

686
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:39,100
Why was I so stupid on our last journey?

687
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:47,470
We brought back the animals, butter, salt
meat, bedclothes, gunpowder, some books.

688
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:54,050
But we knew then that we were on the island
for a long time - a year, two years... perhaps

689
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,240
for the rest of our lives.

690
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,370
Why didn't I think of other, more important
things?

691
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:09,030
CHAPTER TEN
A Second Journey to the Ship

692
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,320
The next morning, Fritz and I got up very
early.

693
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,710
We went to look at our boat.

694
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:19,010
It was in a good state, but it didn't have
a sail.

695
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,660
That was now the Tree House roof.

696
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:28,120
'I think,' said Fritz, 'that we can use long
flat pieces of wood as paddles.'

697
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,820
'Yes,' I said, 'but we must get another sail
from the ship.

698
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,650
The boat will be very heavy with everything
in it.

699
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,350
There's still a strong wind.

700
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,130
We'll run back home and tell the others.

701
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:47,410
We'll go now, and then we'll spend the night
on the ship.'

702
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,970
We went quickly and told them our plans.

703
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,360
My wife said, 'We'll meet you with the sledge
when you come back.

704
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,810
Be careful!'

705
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,810
***

706
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,750
We reached the ship without great problems.

707
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,400
'Now, Fritz, what do we really need?'

708
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,200
'I can only think of one very small thing,'
he answered.

709
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,490
'What's that?'

710
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,650
'I want something to catch big fish.'

711
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,780
'Yes,' I said, 'but we can't eat fish and
meat every day.'

712
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,880
'No,' he answered.

713
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,490
'We must have bread, and fruit, and green
vegetables.'

714
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:30,280
'Do you remember Mr Wilkins, on the ship?

715
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,190
He was moving to a new home.

716
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,790
I'll see if I can find his tools.

717
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,500
You find a fishing line.'

718
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,440
'Yes,' said Fritz.

719
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,540
'I remember watching one of the officers when
he was fishing over the side of the boat.

720
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,790
I know which room was his.

721
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,080
I'll look there.'

722
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,170
I went below and found some gardening tools.

723
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,780
I also found some seeds.

724
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,420
'That's lucky!'

725
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,730
I thought.

726
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:03,800
'Now we'll have lots of different vegetables
to eat.'

727
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,370
Fritz came back with his arms full.

728
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:13,790
'I remember,' I said to Fritz, 'that Mr Wilkins
was bringing a light plough with him.

729
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,680
Shall I take the plough to the island?'

730
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,710
'What will pull it?' asked Fritz.

731
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,570
'I don't think the donkey can pull a plough.'

732
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,940
'No,' I answered, 'no, you're right.

733
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,970
But it isn't very big.

734
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,000
We'll take it.

735
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,800
Perhaps we can use it.'

736
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
***

737
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,370
We slept on the ship that night.

738
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:43,030
The next day was windier, and the sky looked
stormy.

739
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,740
We put a good sail on our boat and started
back towards the land.

740
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:53,740
'Perhaps,' said Fritz, 'we can catch a fish
on the way back to the land.'

741
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,750
He put a fishing line over the side and pulled
it through the water.

742
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,970
Suddenly, we felt something on the line.

743
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:08,000
It was very strong - it pulled the boat back
towards the open sea.

744
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,460
'The fish will carry us away!'

745
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,460
cried Fritz.

746
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,370
'We must cut the line,' I said.

747
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,830
'No, no!'

748
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,290
cried Fritz.

749
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,750
'Let's wait.'

750
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:25,900
Just then, the wind began, and it pushed the
boat towards the land.

751
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:32,170
It became stronger and stronger, and we moved
faster and faster through the water.

752
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:39,120
The boat was thrown up on to the beach and
it broke into pieces.

753
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
***

754
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,140
My wife and the boys were waiting for us.

755
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,880
We quickly took our things off the boat and
put them on the sledge.

756
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,880
'There!

757
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,420
That's all,' I said.

758
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,150
'No,' answered Fritz.

759
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,150
'No!

760
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,530
Let's see if the fish is still with us.'

761
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,370
He went into the water.

762
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,050
'Yes, it's still here.

763
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,900
It's dead.'

764
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,310
So we carried the big fish on to the beach
and put it on the sledge.

765
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:16,940
'This will give us food for days,' I said,
'if it doesn't go bad.

766
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,330
We must put it in salt.'

767
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:24,570
'But now,' said Ernest, 'we haven't got a
boat.

768
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,750
What shall we do?'

769
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:31,490
'We'll take the barrels that we used for the
boat,' I said.

770
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,840
'They'll be very useful for food and other
things.

771
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,340
Ernest, you walk along the beach.

772
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:43,400
I think the sea threw one of the ship's boats
out of the water there.'

773
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,790
I was right.

774
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,520
There was a boat there.

775
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,550
It was badly broken, but we were able to mend
it.

776
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:57,130
We had some of the fish for supper, and it
tasted very nice.

777
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:03,380
Then my wife kept some for our meals the next
day, and put the rest into a barrel with salt.

778
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,380
***

779
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,090
After our meal, we sat round the fire.

780
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:13,470
We talked about the things that we had to
do in the next few days.

781
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,500
'You must make a hut for the tools and other
large things,' said my wife.

782
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,060
'You can't carry those tools up and down into
our house.'

783
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:27,840
'Yes,' I said, 'and we must also make some
huts for the animals.'

784
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,820
'We won't need many huts,' said Ernest.

785
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,820
'Oh?'

786
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,820
I said.

787
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,940
'Let's see.

788
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,420
I think we'll have more animals soon.'

789
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,430
And I was right!

790
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,160
'We must make a garden too,' I said.

791
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,470
'A big garden!' said Fritz.

792
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,950
'What have we got?

793
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,600
Plants and seeds from the ship - and potatoes.

794
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,170
And perhaps we can find other plants on the
island that we can grow in our garden.'

795
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,300
'Yes,' I said, 'but we must build a wall round
the garden.

796
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,870
We don't want the animals to eat the plants.

797
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,840
We'll use bamboo.'

798
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,780
'Oh, that's a lot of work!' said Ernest.

799
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,080
Ernest was lazy and didn't like work.

800
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:20,720
'There's one thing that you haven't told me,'
said my wife.

801
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,580
'You've told me what we'll be able to eat
next year.

802
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,950
But what are we going to eat now?'

803
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,850
'Ah,' I said.

804
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:35,030
'We haven't got any potatoes, but there are
wild plants.

805
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:40,290
I'm sure that there are sweet potatoes on
this island.'

806
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,290
***

807
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,680
Next morning, we all went out and looked for
sweet potatoes.

808
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,040
For some time, we didn't find anything.

809
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,790
Then Fritz found a plant and called me.

810
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:55,340
'Is this a sweet potato?' he asked.

811
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,290
'Yes,' I said.

812
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,599
'It is.'

813
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:01,840
We looked around and found more.

814
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,330
Back at the Tree House, my wife cooked the
sweet potatoes.

815
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,860
They tasted like potatoes, but not as nice.

816
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,540
Then she made some of the potatoes into a
sort of bread.

817
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:28,150
It was quite hard, but good.

818
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:32,260
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Garden

819
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,250
We got up very early in the morning.

820
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,500
We wanted to start work on our garden before
the weather got hot.

821
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,360
Fritz, Ernest and I took our tools.

822
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,120
Jack had a fork, but he wasn't really old
enough.

823
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,700
We all started to work.

824
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,880
After a time, when we were quite tired, I
said, 'Let's see what the animals left on

825
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,610
the ground last night.

826
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:00,810
That'll be very good for the earth in the
garden.'

827
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,330
We went to look.

828
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,720
'The pig!

829
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,160
The pig's gone!'

830
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,610
Jack cried.

831
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:12,790
It was true - the pig was nowhere near the
Tree House.

832
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:16,590
'We can't do anything about that,' I said.

833
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,160
'Perhaps she'll come back again.'

834
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,580
'You said "she"?' said Jack.

835
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,830
'Yes, of course.

836
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,310
I think she's going to be a mother.

837
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,030
Perhaps she's gone away to the forest to have
her babies there.

838
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:37,730
Then she'll come back, I hope.'

839
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,910
We went back and worked again in the garden.

840
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,180
We were all very tired when it was time for
the evening meal.

841
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,410
We had fish and sweet potatoes.

842
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:54,460
'Now,' I said, 'we must work in the garden
again tomorrow, and plant all the seeds from

843
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
the ship.

844
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,440
Then we'll put bamboo around our garden and
make huts for the animals.'

845
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:07,130
'We must make a big hut for the pig,' said
Jack, 'if she has a lot of little pigs.'

846
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,590
'Now, go to bed,' I said to the boys.

847
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,560
'Be ready to work hard tomorrow.

848
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,980
First, we'll get the bamboo.'

849
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,030
'How will we carry a lot of bamboo across
the ground?' asked Jack.

850
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,240
'We can't use the sledge.

851
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,100
Can the donkey pull it?'

852
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,980
'No,' I said.

853
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:32,180
'We won't go to the place where we found bamboo
before.

854
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,540
We'll go to a different place.

855
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,290
Then we'll be able to bring it here more easily.'

856
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,910
'Oh,' said Jack, 'is there an easier way?'

857
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,350
'Yes,' I said, 'we'll go up the river.

858
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:49,780
We'll cut the pieces of bamboo and pull them
to the river.

859
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,020
Then the river can carry them down to our
Tree House.'

860
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,220
'Ah!' said Jack.

861
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:02,720
'Yes, that'll be the best way.'

862
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:09,580
CHAPTER TWELVE
Buffaloes and Other Animals

863
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,880
We left the next morning to get bamboo for
our garden and for animal huts.

864
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,400
My wife and the four boys came with me and
the two dogs, Turk and Flora.

865
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,570
We also took the donkey.

866
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:27,540
We needed it to pull the bamboo to the side
of the river.

867
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:33,400
It was our first visit to this part of the
island, so we took our guns with us.

868
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,610
The dogs were a mistake - but the guns weren't.

869
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:42,280
We went up the river and found a lot of bamboo.

870
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,370
We cut it and tied it together, and the donkey
pulled it to the river.

871
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:51,370
Then we had a meal and rested.

872
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,050
Jack went for a walk.

873
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:59,260
After a time, he came back and said, 'Father,
there's a big field over there, and there

874
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:03,210
are ten or fifteen large horses in it.'

875
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,630
I said, 'Jack, there aren't any horses in
this place.'

876
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,750
'There are!' he said.

877
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,450
'Come and see.'

878
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:17,580
When we came out of the trees, we saw a lot
of buffaloes.

879
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:24,210
We went nearer and nearer until we were about
130 feet away.

880
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,580
The buffaloes stood and looked at us with
their big round eyes.

881
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,680
They didn't seem to be angry or afraid.

882
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,020
I could see two young buffaloes.

883
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,580
Then Turk and Flora began to jump up and down,
making a lot of noise.

884
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:47,310
The buffaloes became angry, and they came
towards us.

885
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:54,340
We were in great danger, but Fritz and I both
used our guns.

886
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:00,740
One of the buffaloes fell dead, and the others
turned and ran away.

887
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,210
We were lucky to escape so easily.

888
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:10,040
I said to Fritz and Ernest, 'Come and catch
those two young buffaloes.

889
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,770
The dogs have pushed them into the trees.

890
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,890
We must take them with us.'

891
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:21,260
We put ropes round their necks, and they came
with us without any trouble.

892
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,880
We hurried away as fast as we could.

893
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,880
'Now,' I said, 'we'll leave the bamboo until
tomorrow.

894
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,200
But the young buffaloes will be very useful!

895
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,420
We'll give them milk from the goat.'

896
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,420
***

897
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,620
The goat gave the young buffaloes her milk.

898
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:45,400
'But,' said Jack, 'there won't be much milk
for us.'

899
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,960
'No,' I said, 'but soon we'll have as much
milk as we need.'

900
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,630
'You seem very pleased about the young buffaloes,'
said Ernest.

901
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:02,530
'Yes, I am,' I answered, 'because now I can
see an answer to two big problems.'

902
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,320
'Oh,' said Ernest, 'what problems?'

903
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,600
'These,' I answered.

904
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,460
'When the goat doesn't give us any more milk,
we won't have any.

905
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,350
But these two young buffaloes will grow up,
and they'll have babies.

906
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:23,790
So we'll have more and more buffaloes and
plenty of milk.

907
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:26,560
Buffalo milk is very good.

908
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,810
We can make butter from it, and perhaps cheese
too.'

909
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:35,560
'And what was the other problem?' asked Fritz.

910
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,730
'The other problem?'

911
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,180
I answered.

912
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,030
'You remember the plough that we brought from
the ship?

913
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,980
I didn't know how we could pull it.

914
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:50,570
A buffalo is very strong and the buffaloes
can pull the plough for us.

915
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:54,750
So now we have a plough and we have milk.'

916
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,030
'Not yet,' said Ernest.

917
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:02,430
'No, not yet,' I answered, 'but next year.

918
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,610
We mustn't think only of today.

919
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:09,119
We must think of future years.'

920
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,119
***

921
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,250
The next day, we went back and cut up the
dead buffalo.

922
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:16,910
We brought a lot of the meat back and put
it into barrels with salt.

923
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:22,400
'Now,' I thought, 'we'll have food in the
winter.'

924
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,040
We also put the bamboo in the river, and the
river carried it down to a place near the

925
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,140
Tree House.

926
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:35,120
We pulled it to the Tree House and started
to put it around our garden.

927
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,120
***

928
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:41,350
Some days later, when the garden was finished,
I said, 'Now we must begin to make huts for

929
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,530
the animals.'

930
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:47,110
'We'll only need three huts,' said Ernest.

931
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,030
'Why only three huts?'

932
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,210
I asked.

933
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:56,440
'We need one for the buffaloes, one for the
goats and another for the sheep,' said Ernest.

934
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,630
'And perhaps we should make a house for the
chickens.'

935
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:04,470
'But,' I said, 'the donkey and the pig need
huts too.'

936
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:08,610
'Oh,' said Ernest, 'the pig's gone.

937
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,770
And today the donkey's gone too.'

938
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:11,770
'Gone?'

939
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,770
I said.

940
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,770
'Yes.

941
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,040
I can't see it anywhere.

942
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,860
And the pig went days ago.'

943
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:24,210
'Yes,' I said, 'but I hope they'll come back.

944
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:29,520
We'll make huts for all of them, and hope.'

945
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,520
***

946
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,550
We were sitting at breakfast, a few days later,
when Fritz said, 'Something's moving in those

947
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,730
tall grasses.

948
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,380
I'll get my gun.'

949
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,940
He ran and got his gun.

950
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,940
'Wait!'

951
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,940
I said.

952
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,020
'Don't shoot.

953
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:47,110
Let's see what it is.'

954
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,680
Jack said, 'I'll go round behind it and look.

955
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,380
If it's dangerous, I'll run away.'

956
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,580
So Jack moved very quietly.

957
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:02,760
He was very good at that because he often
followed birds with his bow and arrow.

958
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:11,660
The thing came nearer - and then out came
our pig with six little ones!

959
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,400
'At last!'

960
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
I said.

961
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,670
'We're all very glad to see you, Mrs Pig.

962
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,500
And your house is ready for you!'

963
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,690
So we pushed the pig and her six babies into
their hut.

964
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,710
Then Franz called to me.

965
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,970
'Look!' he cried.

966
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:36,600
'Flora's had six babies too!'

967
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,530
So now we had eight dogs and seven pigs.

968
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:44,150
'Now where's our donkey?'

969
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,310
I said.

970
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,310
***

971
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:52,550
One morning, we were planting potatoes in
the garden, when we heard a strange noise.

972
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,710
'What's that?'

973
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:54,870
I said.

974
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:58,830
'What sort of animal is making that noise?'

975
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,730
The dogs heard it too.

976
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,680
They looked ready for a fight.

977
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,750
We all looked round.

978
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:10,600
We couldn't see anything, but the noise continued.

979
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:16,750
It came nearer and nearer, and our dogs became
angrier and angrier.

980
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,160
I tied them to a tree.

981
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,190
Then Fritz put down his gun and started to
laugh.

982
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,790
'I can see it,' he said.

983
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,490
'It's our donkey.

984
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,040
He's come back!'

985
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,640
There he was.

986
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:38,120
And then we saw that he wasn't alone.

987
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:44,030
Our donkey was bringing another animal with
him, very similar to a donkey but smaller.

988
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:54,570
'That,' I said to Jack and Ernest, 'is probably
a kind of wild donkey Now don't make a sound.

989
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:59,650
Fritz and I will try to catch her.'

990
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:03,460
Fritz moved towards our donkey, holding some
salt in his hand.

991
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,560
Our donkey loved salt.

992
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:12,350
He came to Fritz, and the wild donkey came
a little closer too.

993
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:17,170
Then, when she was near enough, I put a rope
over her head from behind her.

994
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:22,890
She fought against us, but at last we were
able to tie her up.

995
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,820
I said, 'Perhaps the wild donkey will have
babies.

996
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,950
It will be easier to teach her if she does.

997
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,730
And she'll be useful to us.'

998
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:36,300
And that is what happened, in the end.

999
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:42,680
The chickens were sitting on eggs, and soon
we had forty little ones.

1000
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,240
So now we had a lot of animals to feed.

1001
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:53,080
We had the donkey and the wild donkey, two
buffaloes, the goats, the pigs and the dogs,

1002
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,640
the sheep and the monkey.

1003
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,120
I said, 'We must work very hard and get food
for all these animals.

1004
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,020
The rainy season is coming.'

1005
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,670
So we brought the tent from the beach and
filled it with dry grass.

1006
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:17,910
We got sweet potatoes and coconuts and put
them in a dry place at the foot of the tree.

1007
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:22,440
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Winter

1008
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,370
There were dark clouds in the sky, and the
sea was stormy.

1009
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:33,030
I looked out to sea and thought, 'The Sea
has finally broken up our ship.

1010
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:36,060
There will be more wood on the beach.

1011
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,340
And this rough sea will come up to our boat
on the beach.'

1012
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:44,990
'Boys,' I said, 'we must pull our boat high
up on the beach.

1013
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,990
We don't want the sea to carry it away.

1014
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:52,790
And we must turn it over, so it doesn't fill
with water.'

1015
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:59,030
We went down to the beach and pulled the boat
up high on the sand and turned it over.

1016
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:02,370
Then Ernest pointed and said, 'What's that
thing there?

1017
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,230
That square thing?'

1018
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:08,470
I looked and saw a big box.

1019
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:12,030
It was nearly covered with sand.

1020
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:19,230
We uncovered it and opened it, and it was
full of a sailor's clothes.

1021
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,110
The clothes were very wet and salty from the
sea water.

1022
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:27,270
'We can wash them in the river and dry them,'
I said.

1023
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,070
'They'll be too big for us,' said Jack.

1024
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,680
'They're too big for Fritz, or Ernest.'

1025
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,840
'Yes,' I said, 'they'll be too big for you.

1026
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,910
But you'll be glad when your other clothes
have got wet in the rain.'

1027
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:48,740
Then I thought, 'Now winter's coming, what
do we need?

1028
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,280
Dry firewood for my wife to cook with under
the Tree House.'

1029
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,080
We didn't, of course, cook in the Tree House,
because of the wooden floor.

1030
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:03,260
So we found a lot of firewood and put it at
the foot of the tree, under the Tree House.

1031
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:08,660
Then I thought, 'In the stormy weather we
won't be able to go far from our house to

1032
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,310
get food.

1033
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:15,210
We must be sure that we have a lot of food
in or near the house.

1034
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,990
Then we can use that when the weather's very
bad.

1035
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:21,980
We've got barrels of salt meat and buffalo
meat.

1036
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,600
I hope it will keep well.

1037
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,230
We can't get any more salt.'

1038
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:31,160
The sea was now coming up over the rocks.

1039
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,220
And there was no sunshine to dry the salt.

1040
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:41,110
My thoughts continued, 'We've got eggs, of
course, from our chickens.

1041
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,920
Perhaps we can catch fish with the fishing
line from the ship.

1042
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,670
But that's not easy when the sea is very stormy.

1043
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:52,560
We've got sweet potatoes and a lot of coconuts.

1044
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,690
The goats will give us a little milk, and
there's plenty of dry grass for our animals.'

1045
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:05,920
'Now,' I said to my family,' we've got a good
house and plenty of food, so we're ready for

1046
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,490
the winter.'

1047
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,570
That's what I thought.

1048
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:14,820
But I was very wrong!

1049
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:21,660
The next few months were probably the unhappiest
months that I have ever known in all my life.

1050
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:29,450
We had four enemies - the rain, the wind,
the cold and the shorter days.

1051
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:34,400
The days were not much shorter, but we had
to spend a lot of time inside the house because

1052
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,180
of the bad weather.

1053
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,710
The rain came down like a river from the sky.

1054
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,640
It rained nearly all day and all night.

1055
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,240
There were only a few days when it stopped.

1056
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,750
Most of the land was under water.

1057
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:55,670
The river was too big to cross, and our bridge
was broken.

1058
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:01,750
Luckily our garden was on higher ground, and
our plants were beginning to come through.

1059
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,410
The wind was very strong.

1060
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:08,010
When we made our Tree House, I didn't think
about the wind.

1061
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:13,740
If a house is built on the ground, with good
walls and a low roof, the wind will pass over

1062
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,740
it.

1063
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,280
The house is safe.

1064
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:23,300
But when a house is built up in a tree, the
wind goes up into it.

1065
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,680
The roof of our house was made of sailcloth.

1066
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,980
When it rained, there were deep pools of water
on the roof.

1067
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,990
The water ran over the sides, on to the floor.

1068
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:40,120
Then the strong wind pushed the sailcloth
up, and a river of rain came down into the

1069
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,570
room!

1070
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:50,140
The days were not as hot as before, and the
nights were the same - sometimes even cold.

1071
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,930
We sat all day in wet clothes and we couldn't
dry them.

1072
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,100
In the evenings, we didn't know how to keep
warm.

1073
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:04,540
We put stones on the floor of our tree room
and lit a fire on them, but soon the room

1074
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,370
was full of smoke and we were afraid of a
fire.

1075
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:11,360
We couldn't get the smoke out of the room.

1076
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,840
We couldn't make a hole in the roof because
of the rain.

1077
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,000
When the sun went down, darkness came suddenly.

1078
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,249
But even in the daytime, the room was quite
dark.

1079
01:08:23,249 --> 01:08:25,739
We had no light.

1080
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:28,839
We burned small pieces of wood, giving a little
light.

1081
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:31,880
But that wasn't enough.

1082
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:38,369
So at night we sat round in our wet clothes,
very cold, in the darkness.

1083
01:08:38,369 --> 01:08:42,609
There was nothing to do except sleep.

1084
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:44,520
We couldn't continue like this.

1085
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,349
I said, 'We must go down and live at the foot
of the tree.

1086
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:51,619
We'll put a sailcloth over this floor.

1087
01:08:51,619 --> 01:08:58,179
Then there will be two roofs - the roof in
the tree and the roof on this floor.

1088
01:08:58,179 --> 01:09:01,089
Then we'll be dry down there.'

1089
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:04,259
We built two walls at the foot of the tree.

1090
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:09,749
The animals' huts made the third wall, and
the tree was the fourth wall.

1091
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:15,109
We made a hole in the floor of the upstairs
room for the smoke from our fire.

1092
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:20,270
Now the rain couldn't come straight down on
to the fire.

1093
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:24,819
We were more comfortable in this lower room,
but the smell of the animals came in from

1094
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:28,909
the huts, and that was terrible.

1095
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:29,909
***

1096
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,549
After a time, we began to have problems with
our food.

1097
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:36,809
The buffalo meat went bad because there wasn't
enough salt in the barrels.

1098
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:40,869
Oh, why didn't I think about that before?

1099
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:46,650
We needed a lot of salt to keep our food fresh
through the bad months of the year.

1100
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:50,009
We killed some of the older chickens and ate
them.

1101
01:09:50,009 --> 01:09:54,600
Then, when the weather was better, the boys
were able to go out fishing or shooting with

1102
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,960
their bows and arrows.

1103
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,409
They brought in a little fish and meat.

1104
01:09:59,409 --> 01:10:04,570
We had sweet potatoes, but cooking was very
difficult.

1105
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:09,300
When the weather was good, my wife made enough
sweet-potato bread for a few days.

1106
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,880
But it wasn't very good.

1107
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,889
We didn't have enough food for the animals.

1108
01:10:15,889 --> 01:10:23,150
We killed four of the young dogs, leaving
only Turk and Flora and two of their babies.

1109
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:27,480
We had to find food for the goats, the sheep
and the buffaloes.

1110
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:32,900
We couldn't give them enough food in their
huts, so we moved them out into the forest.

1111
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:37,179
We put coconut shells around their necks,
so we could hear them.

1112
01:10:37,179 --> 01:10:45,730
Then we put a little food in their huts each
night, so they wanted to come back home.

1113
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:50,929
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Cave House

1114
01:10:50,929 --> 01:10:54,400
We were very pleased when the storms ended.

1115
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,580
After those long weeks of rain, the sun shone
again.

1116
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:04,889
We came out from our dark, smelly room and
looked up at the bright sun.

1117
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:09,460
Around us the grass was green, and flowers
were coming through.

1118
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:14,860
In our garden, the plants were coming up very
well - but the birds saw them too!

1119
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:20,659
So Jack guarded them, with Flora's help, and
kept the birds away.

1120
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:26,889
We also put fishing lines across the plants
to protect them from those little thieves.

1121
01:11:26,889 --> 01:11:30,280
We hung up our clothes in the sunlight to
dry them.

1122
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,510
Then we started work on the Tree House.

1123
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:38,070
In a few days, we were able to leave our room
at the foot of the tree and go back to our

1124
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,710
bright and happy home.

1125
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:45,700
'I can't live through another winter like
that,' said my wife.

1126
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,469
'It will kill me.

1127
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:52,449
I'm sure that the first men, thousands of
years ago, didn't live in trees like monkeys.

1128
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:57,790
They lived in caves, and we must find one
too.'

1129
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,130
I knew that she was right.

1130
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:05,969
I went out and walked along the coast and
looked at the hills near the sea.

1131
01:12:05,969 --> 01:12:09,530
Some came straight down to the beach.

1132
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:13,630
Those were possible places for caves.

1133
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:17,469
I walked a long way, but I couldn't see any
big ones.

1134
01:12:17,469 --> 01:12:22,280
I needed a large cave for my family.

1135
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,159
I went back and told my wife and the boys.

1136
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:27,510
The caves weren't large enough for us.

1137
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:35,809
'So,' said Fritz, 'if the caves aren't big
enough, we must make one bigger.'

1138
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:39,219
'You can try,' I said, 'but the rock's very
hard.

1139
01:12:39,219 --> 01:12:42,130
I don't know if it's possible.

1140
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:46,190
I'll take you to the best cave that I've found,
above the beach.

1141
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:52,489
It was probably made by the sea, but the sea's
gone down and left it in the side of the hill.

1142
01:12:52,489 --> 01:12:56,590
Bring the tools and we'll try.'

1143
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,639
So we went to the cave.

1144
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:02,850
We worked for a week, but we only made the
cave six feet deeper.

1145
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:06,210
The rock was very hard.

1146
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:11,719
I thought about using gunpowder, but gunpowder
was too important for us.

1147
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:13,909
I didn't know what to do.

1148
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:15,860
'Shall we stop?'

1149
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,809
I asked Fritz.

1150
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:20,199
'Shall we think of another idea?'

1151
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:26,710
'I think,' said Fritz, 'that the rock is getting
softer.

1152
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:30,449
This piece here seems softer.'

1153
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:35,409
Jack was the smallest, so he was working at
the lowest part of the rock.

1154
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:38,099
One morning, he cried out, 'I've done it!

1155
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:39,249
I've done it!

1156
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,909
I've made a hole right through the rock!'

1157
01:13:41,909 --> 01:13:44,640
'Don't be so silly,' said Fritz.

1158
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,780
'I don't believe you.'

1159
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:50,880
'But I have!' said Jack, 'I have!'

1160
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,250
Fritz went to look.

1161
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,920
He soon came back, saying, 'It's true, Father.

1162
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,920
Jack's right.

1163
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,409
I can't understand it.

1164
01:13:57,409 --> 01:14:02,570
Jack has made a hole in the rock and there's
nothing behind it.'

1165
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,530
I was very surprised.

1166
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,030
I took a long piece of bamboo and put it through
the hole.

1167
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:13,619
'Yes,' I said, 'there's nothing behind there.'

1168
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:15,600
'Let's make the hole bigger,' said Fritz.

1169
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,460
'Then one of us can go through.'

1170
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,710
I said, 'That's dangerous.

1171
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,190
If the hole's very deep, you'll fall.

1172
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:25,230
We must be very careful.

1173
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:27,780
Let's make the hole a little bigger.

1174
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:31,590
Then I can put my head in and look.'

1175
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:35,360
So we made the hole bigger and I put my head
in.

1176
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,040
Suddenly, I felt very ill.

1177
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,500
I moved away.

1178
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,080
'You mustn't go into the cave, boys - if it's
a cave,' I said.

1179
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,170
'The air's really bad and dangerous.

1180
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,579
I'm sure you can die in there.

1181
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:54,309
First, we must drive out the bad air.'

1182
01:14:54,309 --> 01:14:58,150
'How can we do that?' asked Fritz.

1183
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:02,190
'We must light a fire,' I replied.

1184
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:08,520
So we put burning grass and sticks into the
hole, but the fire went out immediately.

1185
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,809
'Perhaps,' said Ernest, 'if we light a fire
just in front of the hole, the hot air will

1186
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,369
pull the cold air out of the cave.'

1187
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:19,460
'Yes, that's possible,' I said.

1188
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:25,280
'But I think that will be slow - and, perhaps,
dangerous.

1189
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:30,050
I think this time we should use some of our
gunpowder.'

1190
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:36,030
So I took some coconut shells, tied some rope
round them and filled them with gunpowder.

1191
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:39,199
Then I lit one and threw it quickly into the
cave.

1192
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:45,030
There was a very loud noise, and the bad air
came out with the smoke.

1193
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:51,320
I did the same with two more coconut shells
and then we tried to light a fire again.

1194
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,250
This time the fire burned.

1195
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:59,469
It didn't burn very well, but the smoke and
hot air came out through the hole and soon

1196
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:02,329
the fire was burning better.

1197
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:11,090
At last, it began to burn brightly - as brightly
inside the cave as in the open air.

1198
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:13,929
'Run to the Tree House,' I said to Ernest.

1199
01:16:13,929 --> 01:16:17,010
'Bring all the small pieces of wood that we've
got.

1200
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:21,239
We can use them as lights when we go into
the cave.'

1201
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:25,270
While he was gone, we made the mouth of the
cave bigger.

1202
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:29,400
Then we could see the walls that were nearest
the doorway.

1203
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:35,889
Jack looked in and said, 'The walls are covered
with beautiful stones in lots of different

1204
01:16:35,889 --> 01:16:36,889
colours.

1205
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,719
It's wonderful!'

1206
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,389
I looked into the cave.

1207
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,219
Jack was right.

1208
01:16:42,219 --> 01:16:45,849
The walls were covered with things that looked
like stones.

1209
01:16:45,849 --> 01:16:49,170
'That's very strange,' I said.

1210
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,820
'What are they?'

1211
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,760
Then Ernest came back from the Tree House,
bringing the wood.

1212
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,830
I went into the cave first.

1213
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:00,050
I wanted to be sure that the air was good.

1214
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:02,440
I looked at the stones.

1215
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,090
Some were lying on the floor because of the
gunpowder.

1216
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:08,849
I took one and tasted it.

1217
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:10,260
It was salt.

1218
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,260
Salt!

1219
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:14,249
'Look, boys,' I cried.

1220
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:17,999
'We'll never have to look for salt again!

1221
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:25,099
Next winter we'll have plenty of salt, and
we'll have meat through all the bad months.'

1222
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:27,219
We looked round the cave.

1223
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:28,929
It was very big.

1224
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:33,880
I saw that we could make a room at one end
for all our things, with a bedroom next to

1225
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,989
it.

1226
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:38,480
We could have another big room as a kitchen
and sitting room.

1227
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:43,800
'But,' I said, 'there's one thing that we
must make now.

1228
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,539
I don't think this end of the cave is very
far from the outside air.

1229
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:51,230
I'll hit the rock inside the cave.

1230
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:54,789
I want you, Fritz, to go outside and listen.

1231
01:17:54,789 --> 01:17:57,760
Tell me where you hear me most clearly.

1232
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,760
Put a stick there to show the place.'

1233
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:07,139
So Fritz went out and I started to knock on
the inside of the cave wall in different places.

1234
01:18:07,139 --> 01:18:12,110
After a time, he came back and said, 'I've
found the best place.

1235
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:13,960
I can hear you quite well.'

1236
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:14,960
'Ah!'

1237
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:15,960
I said.

1238
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,699
'Then we'll make a hole through there from
the outside.

1239
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:22,360
We need fresh air in the cave.

1240
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:27,440
It'll be hard work, but we must do it.'

1241
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,440
***

1242
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:34,670
It was hard work, but after two days Fritz
was able to put bamboo through the hole.

1243
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:37,800
The other end of it came into the cave.

1244
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,080
Then we made the hole bigger from inside the
cave.

1245
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:47,030
'Now,' I said, 'we can make a fireplace, with
a hole for the smoke.'

1246
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:50,630
So we started work, using stones and earth.

1247
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:53,670
We made a good fireplace, with a hole for
the smoke.

1248
01:18:53,670 --> 01:19:00,090
'Now,' I said, 'we'll see if this idea really
works.'

1249
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:04,190
So we lit a fire, but the smoke came out into
the cave.

1250
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,739
I saw that the boys were very sad.

1251
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:10,559
They thought that all their work was for nothing.

1252
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:13,780
'No,' I said, 'don't worry.

1253
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:17,340
When the hole gets warm, the air will go up
it.

1254
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,570
It'll be all right.

1255
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:24,539
Keep the fire going for two days, and it'll
work very well.'

1256
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:26,500
And that was what happened.

1257
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:31,159
On the second evening, the air began to go
up the hole and it took all the smoke out

1258
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:32,290
of the cave.

1259
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:39,370
'Now,' I said, 'we don't have to fear the
next winter.'

1260
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:40,829
My wife was very pleased.

1261
01:19:40,829 --> 01:19:48,349
She said, 'Now I can cook and dry your clothes,
and we can sit round a nice bright fire on

1262
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:49,679
winter evenings.

1263
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,739
We'll be very happy.'

1264
01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:55,860
'Yes,' I said, 'but we'll have to do a lot
more work.

1265
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,639
Next winter we'll have more animals.

1266
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:01,659
We must build a farm between the Tree House
and the cave.

1267
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:04,849
Then the animals can live there in the summer
and winter.'

1268
01:20:04,849 --> 01:20:09,980
'And we'll need a lot more food,' said Fritz.

1269
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,390
'Yes,' I said.

1270
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:17,380
'We can use the plough to make fields, and
we must grow lots of vegetables.

1271
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,670
To work!

1272
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:21,650
To work!'

1273
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,650
***

1274
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,969
So we all had a very busy summer.

1275
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:29,840
We put lots of salt meat, dried fish and coconuts
in the cave.

1276
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:35,199
When the end of the year came, we added potatoes
and sweet potatoes.

1277
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:40,930
Then we made a hut at the farm, and put dried
grass and other food in it for the animals.

1278
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,969
We built a small hut there for someone to
live in.

1279
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:48,539
They could look after the farm at night and
drive away wild animals.

1280
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:53,420
'What are we going to do about clothes?' asked
my wife.

1281
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:58,389
'The boys' clothes are in a terrible state,
and the clothes from the sailor's box aren't

1282
01:20:58,389 --> 01:21:00,110
very useful.

1283
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:02,810
When we found them, they were full of sea
water.

1284
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:04,860
Now they're falling to pieces.

1285
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,659
They'll be all right for another year, but
not longer.

1286
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:12,400
I must make cloth.'

1287
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,969
'How can you make cloth?' said Fritz.

1288
01:21:14,969 --> 01:21:16,229
'From what?

1289
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:18,579
We've only got two sheep.'

1290
01:21:18,579 --> 01:21:24,070
'There are plants,' I said, 'that we can use
for cloth.'

1291
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:27,710
I won't tell you about all our problems with
those plants.

1292
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:31,780
But in the end, my wife was able to make cloth.

1293
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:37,800
It wasn't very good and it wasn't very white,
but she was happy.

1294
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,739
But until then the boys wore animal skins.

1295
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:46,440
They caught the animals, and we now had plenty
of salt.

1296
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:52,699
So we prepared the skins, and my wife was
able to make clothes out of them.

1297
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:58,780
So the year passed - our second year on the
island.

1298
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,170
The boys were getting big and strong.

1299
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:07,199
Fritz was now nearly sixteen, and Ernest was
fourteen.

1300
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:10,210
I thought about the future.

1301
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:15,030
One evening, I said to them, 'You two are
the oldest.

1302
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:19,920
Soon I'll have two fine, strong men to help
me in our work on the island.

1303
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:26,130
As I become older, you'll be able to do the
harder work.

1304
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:30,219
Jack is a quick learner and he can help your
mother.

1305
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:35,739
Little Franz isn't very helpful yet, but he's
a good little boy and doesn't give us much

1306
01:22:35,739 --> 01:22:37,230
trouble.

1307
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:43,989
Yes, we're very lucky.'

1308
01:22:43,989 --> 01:22:48,420
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Canoe

1309
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:52,699
As the years passed, we made our houses better.

1310
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:55,489
We put a wooden roof on the Tree House.

1311
01:22:55,489 --> 01:23:00,360
The rain didn't come through in winter after
that, but it still wasn't a good home for

1312
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,719
the rainy season.

1313
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:05,900
We also built a place in front of the cave.

1314
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:10,840
We could sit out there and enjoy the sea air
and the sunlight.

1315
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,719
The farm became bigger and bigger.

1316
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:18,570
The buffaloes pulled the plough and they gave
us all our milk.

1317
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:21,910
We were able to make butter from it too.

1318
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:26,530
We got more eggs from our chickens than we
could eat in the spring and the summer.

1319
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,980
In the winter, we had just enough eggs for
our needs.

1320
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,519
The wild donkey had a baby.

1321
01:23:33,519 --> 01:23:39,630
It was very pretty and it was easier to teach
than its mother.

1322
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:40,630
***

1323
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:42,530
Of course we had problems.

1324
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:45,469
One morning, Jack came running back from the
farm.

1325
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:50,320
'Oh Father, Father, come and see!' he cried.

1326
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,760
I went down there.

1327
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:59,140
Everything in the farm buildings was broken,
and the plants from the fields were everywhere.

1328
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:01,159
Monkeys laughed at us from the trees.

1329
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:02,480
'Oh no!'

1330
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,800
I said.

1331
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,719
'They've destroyed everything.

1332
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,960
We must be sure that this never happens again.'

1333
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,420
Turk and Flora's babies were now old enough
for us to teach them.

1334
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:22,199
We made a rule that one of us - Fritz, Ernest
or I - always slept down at the farm with

1335
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:23,199
the dogs.

1336
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,769
They were quick to learn about the monkeys.

1337
01:24:26,769 --> 01:24:29,610
We showed them that they must always run after
a monkey.

1338
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,840
When they did, the monkeys ran away.

1339
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:36,690
Soon the monkeys stopped coming to the farm.

1340
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:37,690
***

1341
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:43,719
As I watched my boys grow up, I was very pleased
with them.

1342
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:46,920
Fritz was very strong and tall.

1343
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,420
Ernest wasn't as big, and he was quieter.

1344
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,849
But he wasn't as lazy as before.

1345
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:58,679
He wrote down the names of all the plants
on the island and drew pictures of them.

1346
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:05,329
He made some paper out of plants, like the
Egyptians many thousands of years ago.

1347
01:25:05,329 --> 01:25:08,310
Franz was more sensible than Jack.

1348
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:10,829
He always did what he promised to do.

1349
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:17,489
But Jack was a good son too, and he did a
lot of work on the farm.

1350
01:25:17,489 --> 01:25:23,889
Franz liked helping his mother, while Jack
spent more time with me.

1351
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:24,889
***

1352
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:28,809
One day, Fritz said to me, 'I'd like to go
away alone.

1353
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:32,820
I want to visit the parts of the island that
we haven't seen.

1354
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,699
The ship's boat is too heavy for one person.

1355
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:37,579
I want to make a canoe.'

1356
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:41,511
'I think we can make a canoe,' I said.

1357
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,320
'I've seen canoes made from the bark of tall
trees.

1358
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,130
I'll try to help you.'

1359
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:52,530
We found a big tree and I cut a ring round
the bark, at the bottom.

1360
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:56,030
Then I tied a rope ladder to one of the branches.

1361
01:25:56,030 --> 01:26:02,170
I told Fritz to cut round the tree about twenty
feet up from the ring.

1362
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:07,869
Then I made a cut from top to bottom between
the two circles.

1363
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:13,729
We took the bark off very carefully, and it
fell away in one piece.

1364
01:26:13,729 --> 01:26:18,980
We tied pieces of bamboo to our canoe to hold
it in the right shape.

1365
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:22,630
Then we nailed together the sides at each
end of the boat.

1366
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:27,909
A sweet juice from one of the trees dried
quickly and went hard.

1367
01:26:27,909 --> 01:26:31,559
We used this to fill the holes.

1368
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:37,081
'I think,' said Fritz, 'that the water will
come in over the front of the canoe, and perhaps

1369
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:39,320
over the back.

1370
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,789
Perhaps we should cover those places.

1371
01:26:41,789 --> 01:26:44,230
We can leave a place in the middle where I
can sit.'

1372
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:47,650
'Yes,' I said, 'you're right.

1373
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:51,429
We must put a light cover over it.'

1374
01:26:51,429 --> 01:26:55,079
We also found a long flat piece of wood.

1375
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:59,849
Fritz could use that as a paddle, to move
the boat along.

1376
01:26:59,849 --> 01:27:03,349
When the canoe was ready, we waited for a
few days.

1377
01:27:03,349 --> 01:27:08,610
Then it was dry, and we tried it in the water.

1378
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,570
At first, Fritz had problems in the canoe.

1379
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:14,269
It turned over and he often fell out.

1380
01:27:14,269 --> 01:27:24,449
But he practised, and after a few days he
was able to travel safely, even in rough sea.

1381
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:28,520
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Jenny

1382
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,599
One day, Fritz went away in his little canoe.

1383
01:27:31,599 --> 01:27:34,400
He stayed away all day.

1384
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,530
In the evening, my wife became very worried.

1385
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:42,619
'I'm afraid that something has happened to
him,' she said.

1386
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:45,429
We couldn't do anything, so we went to bed.

1387
01:27:45,429 --> 01:27:47,440
But we didn't sleep very much.

1388
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:54,650
The next day, we went up to the top of a hill,
but we couldn't see him.

1389
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,159
Then Ernest pointed.

1390
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,830
'Look!' he said.

1391
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:01,500
'Is that him?'

1392
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,929
We looked.

1393
01:28:02,929 --> 01:28:04,949
It was Fritz in his canoe.

1394
01:28:04,949 --> 01:28:08,880
We all ran down to the water to meet him.

1395
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,789
'Oh, Fritz,' cried his mother, 'I thought
you were dead.'

1396
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:18,190
While he was having breakfast, Fritz told
us his story.

1397
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:25,179
'I've always wanted to know more about the
west of the island, so I decided to look there.

1398
01:28:25,179 --> 01:28:29,269
I took my gun and some gunpowder, a fishing
line and my knife.

1399
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:33,780
I came to the place where we found shellfish
for the first time.

1400
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:37,660
I went for a swim there, and I found a lot
more.

1401
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:42,520
I brought some up on to the beach and opened
them.

1402
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,099
Inside one of them I found this.'

1403
01:28:46,099 --> 01:28:47,210
He held out his hand.

1404
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:50,510
In it there was a large pearl.

1405
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:54,640
'I opened some more and I found a lot of pearls.

1406
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,640
Look!'

1407
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:01,500
'If you make holes through them, Mother can
wear them around her neck,' said Jack.

1408
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,530
'No, no,' said my wife, 'I don't want them.

1409
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:09,989
Who wants to wear pearls on this island?'

1410
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:14,229
'Perhaps one day,' I said, 'a ship will come
and take you home.

1411
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:16,489
You can sell these for a lot of money.

1412
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:19,610
We'll put them in a safe place.'

1413
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:24,479
'I haven't told you the most important thing,'
said Fritz.

1414
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:27,960
'I went on farther to the west.

1415
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,639
In the evening, I sat on the beach and had
a meal.

1416
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:35,940
As I was sitting there, a big bird flew over
me.

1417
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,880
It was flying very slowly, so I shot it.

1418
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,080
Then I saw why it was flying so slowly.

1419
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,909
It was hurt.

1420
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:49,130
And this was tied around its leg.'

1421
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:52,619
He showed us a little piece of cloth with
writing on it.

1422
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:57,559
I looked at the writing: 'Help!

1423
01:29:57,559 --> 01:30:00,110
Sailor on Smoking Island.'

1424
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:03,889
'The person wrote the message in blood!'

1425
01:30:03,889 --> 01:30:05,559
I said.

1426
01:30:05,559 --> 01:30:11,110
'Yes,' said Fritz, 'but where is the smoking
island?

1427
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:15,260
I went up the hill behind me and I looked
out to sea.

1428
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:21,019
There, far out at sea, there was a little
smoke going into the sky.

1429
01:30:21,019 --> 01:30:24,010
It came from a small island.

1430
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:29,280
'I went out to the island and climbed up to
the top.

1431
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:33,979
In a little wood, I saw a small hut made of
branches.

1432
01:30:33,979 --> 01:30:39,280
In front of the hut there was a fire, and
fish was cooking in a big shell.

1433
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,749
I hid behind a tree and waited.

1434
01:30:41,749 --> 01:30:45,100
Then someone came out of the hut.

1435
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,639
She was wearing the coat of a ship's officer.

1436
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,090
She went to the fire.

1437
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:53,980
I came out of the trees and she turned round.'

1438
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:54,980
'She!'

1439
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,099
I said.

1440
01:30:56,099 --> 01:30:59,469
'Did you say "she"?'

1441
01:30:59,469 --> 01:31:00,729
'Yes.

1442
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:03,110
It was a young woman!

1443
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:04,889
I told her not to be afraid.

1444
01:31:04,889 --> 01:31:07,090
I told her about us.

1445
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:09,599
She can live with us, can't she?

1446
01:31:09,599 --> 01:31:12,120
We will bring her here, won't we?'

1447
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,909
'Yes, of course we will.

1448
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:17,670
But tell us about her.'

1449
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:22,400
'Her father's William Montrose, an officer
who lives in India.

1450
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,760
Her mother died when she was born.

1451
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:30,900
Her father was going back to England in a
ship with his men, so Jenny had to travel

1452
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,810
in another ship.

1453
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:35,949
Her ship was lost in a storm a year ago.

1454
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:41,590
'She got away in a boat with a ship's officer
and some sailors.

1455
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:44,510
The officer gave her his coat.

1456
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:48,469
He told her to watch for another ship or for
land.

1457
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,890
Then another storm came.

1458
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:53,660
A big wave covered the boat...

1459
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:57,679
She doesn't know what happened after that.

1460
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,929
When she opened her eyes, she was on that
little island.'

1461
01:32:01,929 --> 01:32:05,889
'How has she lived there for more than a year?'

1462
01:32:05,889 --> 01:32:08,050
'I asked her that.

1463
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:12,179
She's got shellfish, and there are coconuts
on the trees.

1464
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:16,690
She made a fishing line from her hair and
she catches small fish.

1465
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:20,050
She uses stones to make a fire.

1466
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:26,559
She's made a little hut for birds from bamboo,
but she can only catch small ones.

1467
01:32:26,559 --> 01:32:30,449
When the big bird came down on the island,
it hurt its leg.

1468
01:32:30,449 --> 01:32:35,699
So she was able to tie that piece of cloth
round it, with her call for help.'

1469
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:38,790
'And the bird came to you.'

1470
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:40,909
'Yes,' said Fritz.

1471
01:32:40,909 --> 01:32:45,159
'I sat with her and listened to her story.

1472
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,309
Then I told her to stay on the island.

1473
01:32:47,309 --> 01:32:50,729
I promised to return as quickly as possible.

1474
01:32:50,729 --> 01:32:54,499
I couldn't come all the way home that day.

1475
01:32:54,499 --> 01:32:57,909
I slept on the beach and started again this
morning.

1476
01:32:57,909 --> 01:33:00,179
Can we go to Jenny today?'

1477
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:04,530
'Yes,' I said, 'yes, if we start immediately.'

1478
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:06,579
***

1479
01:33:06,579 --> 01:33:10,050
I asked my wife to make preparations for Jenny.

1480
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:17,400
Then, taking a day's food with us, Fritz and
I left in the ship's boat.

1481
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,190
Jenny was waving from the beach as we came
near.

1482
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:28,250
We stepped out of the boat onto the beach,
and she threw her arms round my neck and cried.

1483
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,900
We sailed back home along the coast.

1484
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:36,760
Mother and the three boys were waiting on
the beach to meet Jenny.

1485
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:43,099
My wife said, 'I'll have to dress you like
one of my sons, because these are our only

1486
01:33:43,099 --> 01:33:46,280
clothes.'

1487
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,420
Jenny had a bath and dressed in sailors' clothes.

1488
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:58,059
Then she joined us for a large lunch, and
Jack put flowers in her hair.

1489
01:33:58,059 --> 01:33:59,059
***

1490
01:33:59,059 --> 01:34:01,960
Perhaps my boys thought that they could teach
Jenny a lot of things.

1491
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,059
But she could shoot better than they could.

1492
01:34:05,059 --> 01:34:09,999
'My father taught me in India,' she said.

1493
01:34:09,999 --> 01:34:12,820
She was very good at catching fish.

1494
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:16,900
She was able to tell Ernest the real names
of many of his plants.

1495
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:22,270
'I learned all that at school,' she told him.

1496
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:27,179
Very soon she and the boys were close friends.

1497
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:29,969
Jenny thought about her father all the time.

1498
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:35,219
'I'm sure that ships are looking for me,'
she said.

1499
01:34:35,219 --> 01:34:39,769
Fritz said, 'If a ship comes, we'll hear a
gun.

1500
01:34:39,769 --> 01:34:42,150
We'll answer with our guns.

1501
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,809
Then they'll know that we're here.'

1502
01:34:44,809 --> 01:34:50,699
'A ship will come one day and take me back
to Father,' Jenny said.

1503
01:34:50,699 --> 01:34:55,010
'I'm very happy with you, but he's probably
very sad.

1504
01:34:55,010 --> 01:35:00,300
He doesn't know if I am alive or dead.'

1505
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,300
***

1506
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:05,070
The summer ended and the winter passed.

1507
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:09,179
Early one morning, Fritz went out in his canoe.

1508
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:12,749
He was looking for a nice big fish for our
lunch.

1509
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:18,400
Then, suddenly, we saw him turn round and
come back.

1510
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,469
'Quick!

1511
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:21,409
Quick!' he cried.

1512
01:35:21,409 --> 01:35:23,809
'There's a ship!'

1513
01:35:23,809 --> 01:35:26,530
We ran up to the top of a hill with our guns.

1514
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:27,530
'BANG!'

1515
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:31,880
There was an answering shot from far away.

1516
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:38,300
We waited, then used the gun again, and the
answer came, louder and nearer.

1517
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,679
Then we saw a boat coming towards the beach.

1518
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,460
We ran down to meet it.

1519
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:46,090
An officer stepped out.

1520
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:51,409
'I am Officer Littleton,' he said, 'of the
Unicom.

1521
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:54,580
Is Miss Jenny Montrose here?

1522
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:59,110
Some of the sailors from her ship, the Dorcas,
told me to try these islands, because the

1523
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:01,710
ship was lost near here.'

1524
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:09,750
'Yes,' I said, 'Miss Jenny Montrose is here,
and she's safe.'

1525
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:15,510
He looked at me and my family, and at Jenny
in sailors' clothes.

1526
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:19,010
'But...' he said.

1527
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:21,510
I told him my name.

1528
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:23,559
'And this is my wife...

1529
01:36:23,559 --> 01:36:26,469
my sons Fritz...

1530
01:36:26,469 --> 01:36:27,469
Ernest...

1531
01:36:27,469 --> 01:36:28,469
Jack...

1532
01:36:28,469 --> 01:36:38,119
Franz... and this,' I said, 'is Jenny, our
Jenny.'

1533
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:43,199
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The End

1534
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:47,760
I am writing this chapter with a sad heart.

1535
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,949
The Unicorns boat is waiting to take this
story of our life here to England.

1536
01:36:52,949 --> 01:36:57,560
There, perhaps, it will become a book.

1537
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:03,300
Other people will learn about our beautiful
island, and perhaps some will want to join

1538
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,539
us in this quiet, simple, happy life.

1539
01:37:06,539 --> 01:37:17,150
I asked my children, 'Do you want to go back
to Europe, boys, or to stay here?'

1540
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:24,000
Ernest said, 'I want to stay and learn more
about the plants, but the officer must send

1541
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,979
me books.'

1542
01:37:26,979 --> 01:37:30,820
Jack and Franz were too small to go.

1543
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,329
I turned to Fritz.

1544
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:34,670
'And you, Fritz?

1545
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:39,099
Do you want to go back to Europe?'

1546
01:37:39,099 --> 01:37:41,159
He took Jenny's hand in his.

1547
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:49,179
'Yes,' he said, 'we want to go now, but we'll
come back.'

1548
01:37:49,179 --> 01:37:55,239
Officer Littleton left us some things, and
we gave him our pearls.

1549
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:58,690
'I'll send you more from Europe,' he promised.

1550
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:03,309
'I'll sell the pearls for you to pay for them
and for Fritz's school,'

1551
01:38:03,309 --> 01:38:07,360
I must stop.

1552
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,370
The boat is waiting.

1553
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:11,590
Goodbye, my boy.

1554
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,409
Goodbye, Jenny.

1555
01:38:13,409 --> 01:38:14,870
Until we meet again!

1556
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:15,350
- THE END -
