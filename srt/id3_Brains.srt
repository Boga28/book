1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,360
BRAINS

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,840
The small monkey carefully completed the 
last piece of the one-hundred-piece puzzle.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
When all the pieces of the 
puzzle were put together,  

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,400
they made a copy of Sunflowers, a 
picture by the famous painter, Van Gogh.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,480
'Well done, Max!' said a 
young woman in a white coat.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,160
'It only took you twenty 
minutes this time - that's  

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
much better than the last time you tried it.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
Have a bite of lovely banana.'

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,600
The woman reached for the fruit from a 
bowl close by and gave it to the monkey.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Max ate it happily.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,840
The woman's name was Gina Capaldi 
and she was twenty-six years old.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,680
She was studying for a Ph.D.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,240
at a university in Rome.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,560
She was hoping to become a Doctor of Science.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,840
Her ideas had already caused much excitement.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,120
Now her work was almost finished.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,320
Great things were expected of her.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,720
As Gina prepared the monkey's next 
drug, Max played with his Rubik cube.

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,000
The Rubik cube was one of Max's favourite puzzles.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,200
He enjoyed turning around the 
sides of the cube in his hands  

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
so that each of the six 
sides was a different colour.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
Gina looked over at him and was pleased.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
He was getting better every day.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
Max completed the Rubik cube in five minutes.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:08,400
Mr Dimitri sat behind a big desk in a large 
office in a huge building in New York.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,600
On the front of his desk was a sign in gold 
letters which read: Mr Theodore Dimitri.

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
On his door there was a much bigger sign  

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,320
which read: President of the Centre for 
Science and Business Development (CSBD).

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,520
Mr Dimitri was middle-aged and 
wore a large dark-grey suit.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
He smoked a thick expensive cigar.

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,520
The smoke from his cigar filled the room.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Today he was going to see his 
most promising new scientists.

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
They were all studying for Ph.D.s so that 
they could become Doctors of Science.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,800
They had to give him their new ideas 
if they wanted money from the CSBD.

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
Mr Dimitri did this every year.

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,240
If he liked their work, CSBD would 
give them lots of money to develop it.

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
That was the way to make money in the future.

38
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,960
And Mr Dimitri was good at making money.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
But if he didn't like the 
work of these scientists,  

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
or if he didn't like them, he 
didn't have to give them a cent.

41
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,560
'After all,' Mr Dimitri 
thought, 'Business is business.'

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
Miss Epstein, his secretary, came into his office.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
'Miss Capaldi to see you, 
Mr Dimitri, sir,' she said.

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,320
'Send her in, Miss Epstein,' said Mr Dimitri 
in a voice which was cold and business-like.

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Gina Capaldi stood in her best suit 
and shoes in front of the big desk.

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,240
She wanted to look her best before Mr Dimitri.

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,440
In her bag was all the 
information needed about her work.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,520
She felt ready.

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,320
'Do sit down, Miss Capaldi.

50
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,840
I've heard so many good things about you,'  

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,480
said Mr Dimitri in a voice that 
now sounded friendly and welcoming.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
'Thank you, Mr Dimitri,' said Gina.

53
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
She sat down in front of the big desk.

54
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,040
Then Miss Epstein seemed to appear out 
of nowhere with coffee and biscuits.

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,560
She put them on the desk and was gone again.

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,440
'Allow me,' said Mr Dimitri, as he put his 
cigar down for a moment and poured the coffee.

57
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,760
Gina took her coffee and left the biscuits.

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
She didn't feel like eating.

59
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,840
She was nervous.

60
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr Dimitri smiled at her with 
teeth that were large and white.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Perfect teeth.

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,240
His cigar found its way back to his mouth.

63
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
The smoke rose up.

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
'Tell me, Gina...

65
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
may I call you Gina?' he asked.

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
'Of course, Mr Dimitri,' she answered.

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Mr Dimitri continued.

68
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,800
'Tell me about your latest work; I've 
heard very interesting things about it,  

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,400
but I would like you to explain it 
clearly to a simple man such as myself.'

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Gina knew that Theodore Dimitri 
was far from being simple.

71
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,120
You don't get to be the head of CSBD,  

72
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,080
the biggest organisation of its 
kind, if you aren't very clever.

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
She knew his decision could change her life.

74
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,480
Gina began: 'I've discovered a 
drug which raises intelligence.'

75
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,920
'Hold on, Gina!' said Mr pimitri.

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,160
'You mean to say you've found a 
way of making people smarter?'

77
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
'Yes,' Gina answered.

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,760
'And without any harmful side 
effects as far as I can tell .

79
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,160
'As far as you can tell?' Mr 
Dimitri said, his eyebrows raised.

80
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:57,760
'I mean,' said Gina, 'the work has not been 
used on people - I've only worked on animals.

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Especially Max.'

82
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,760
'Max?' asked Mr Dimitri.

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,440
'Sorry - Max is a monkey,' Gina explained.

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
'A monkey...'

85
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,240
said Mr Dimitri but his voice sounded 
less friendly than it had before.

86
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,800
Gina knew she had to persuade him somehow.

87
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,160
'Max has done really well - it's quite amazing.

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,760
He now has the intelligence of 
an eight-year-old human child.

89
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
He can do many things...'

90
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,720
'You want money for a performing 
monkey?' said Mr Dimitri.

91
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,520
He sounded a little annoyed.

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,480
'I can go to any cheap show to 
see smart monkeys doing tricks.

93
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
And I don't have to pay a 
lot of money for it, either.'

94
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,920
'Mr Dimitri,' Gina said as she reached 
for her bag, 'I have a video of Max.

95
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,560
I think you should see it 
before you make any decisions.'

96
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,040
'Oh, you do?' His voice was 
lower - not a good sign.

97
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,480
'Yes,' said Gina.

98
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
'If you would allow me.

99
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm sure you'll be as excited 
as I am once you've seen it.'

100
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Gina did not want to give up without a fight.

101
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,840
Her future depended on Mr Dimitri's decision.

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,960
'Let's see what you've got,' 
he said in his low voice.

103
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
The video showed Max three years earlier,  

104
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,240
before Gina had begun to work on him 
when he was still a normal monkey.

105
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,840
Then, three months after her work had begun, Max 
was seen drawing simple pictures with a pencil.

106
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,040
After a year he was spelling out simple words.

107
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,080
After two years he could add 
and take away simple numbers.

108
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,920
After three years he could read, 
write and do basic mathematics.

109
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
He also understood everything Gina said to him.

110
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,000
Max had come to see Gina as 
his mother and he loved her.

111
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,120
The video finished with Max putting his 
arms around Gina while Gin" laughed.

112
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,840
'That's one smart monkey.

113
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,160
Can you make him any smarter?' Mr Dimitri asked.

114
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,200
Gina knew he was interested.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
She was pleased.

116
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,800
'Max can be as intelligent as we 
want to make him, Mf Dimitri,'  

117
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,400
she said, trying not to show her 
pleasure in whac she had achieved.

118
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
'Yes,' he said.

119
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:23,760
'But could that monkey be made to be as 
smart as a man?'(Or a woman, thought Gina)

120
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,520
'As I said, Mr Dimitri,' said Gina, 'we 
can make him as intelligent as we want to.'

121
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:43,920
'You mean,' asked Mr Dimitri, 'that that 
monkey could get to be smarter than I am?'

122
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,600
'I suppose it is possible - there's no 
reason why not, as far as I can tell.

123
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Although, of course, Max is a long 
way from that just now,' Gina said.

124
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,960
'But you're working on it, 
right?' Mr Dimitri asked.

125
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,760
'Well, er...

126
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,600
yes.'

127
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,840
Gina was less confident now.

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,880
'And what if you worked on a human being 
- could you make them smarter?' he asked.

129
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,440
Gina answered: 'I think so, Mr Dimitri.'

130
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,520
Mr Dimitri narrowed his eyes.

131
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
'You only think so?'

132
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,840
'Well,' said Gina, 'the brains of a monkey 
and a man are built in much the same way,  

133
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
so I'm almost certain.'

134
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,840
'Almost certain.

135
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Hmm...'

136
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,880
Mr Dimitri looked out of the window, down at 
the streets of the busy city far below them.

137
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,600
His cigar smoke rose lazily to the ceiling.

138
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,000
Gina's hopes of money and success - and her Ph.D.

139
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
- depended largely on the 
decision Mr Dimitri would make.

140
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,440
'Tell me, Miss Capaldi...'

141
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
said Mr Dimitri.

142
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Gina noticed he had stopped using her first name.

143
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,920
This looked bad.

144
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
'...

145
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,440
have you ever taken this stuff yourself 
to increase your own intelligence?'  

146
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,280
Widi that, he turned to look 
out of the window again.

147
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,920
'Of course not, Mr Dimitri,' Gina 
said to the back of his head.

148
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
'But if you think I should...'

149
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,840
'NO!'

150
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,840
Mr Dimitri had turned suddenly 
from the window as he said this.

151
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,160
The speed of his action surprised 
her because he was such a large man.

152
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,320
His eyes were wide and looked angry.

153
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,560
Gina was scared.

154
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:21,680
'Miss Capaldi,' Mr Dimitri said, lowering 
his voice, 'your work has been very good.

155
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,480
In fact, it has been excellent 
and you have my congratulations.

156
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,760
Unfortunately, I must ask you 
to stop what you are doing.

157
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,520
At "once.'

158
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Gina's mouth suddenly felt very dry and 
she felt the hairs on her head rise up.

159
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,560
'But Mr Dimitri,' she said, 'I've done so much...

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,720
all my work, my Ph.D!'

161
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
'Who is going to believe you if they wonder for  

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,280
one moment if you took some of this stuff 
yourself?' Mr Dimitri's voice softened.

163
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,400
'They would say that anybody could get a Ph.D.

164
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,280
with your wonder drug to help them.

165
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,120
And they'd be right.'

166
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
'But I never...

167
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:22,960
I mean...

168
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
I wouldn't dream of doing 
such a thing!' said Gina.

169
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,000
She tried not to show the disappointment she felt.

170
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
'Wouldn't you?' said Mr Dimitri.

171
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
'There are many people that would take this stuff.

172
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,960
And many that would think that you had, too.'

173
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Gina looked alarmed, but said nothing.

174
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,920
'Yes,' he continued, 'it's 
a sad fact but a true one.

175
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,800
Many people would think that you had taken 
your own drug to make yourself smarter.

176
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,160
They would see you as being no different to those  

177
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,600
athletes who take stuff 
they're not supposed to take.

178
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,360
It might make them do better but 
it's not honest, is it, Miss Capaldi?  

179
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,440
And it's no different for CSBD 
- we do not want people to think  

180
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,600
that we are anything other than 
a completely honest organisation.

181
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,760
If they ever thought we had anything to do with 
such behaviour they would never trust us again!'

182
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,640
'But I promise you...

183
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,640
my work has all been done honestly,' said Gina.

184
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,040
'I never took anything!'

185
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,000
'But,' said Mr Dimitri as he 
looked straight at Gina's eyes,  

186
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,840
'you would if I asked you to, wouldn't you?'

187
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,000
Gina knew it was true, so she said 
nothing and looked at the floor.

188
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Mr Dimitri turned his great weight towards 
her and put his hand on her shoulder.

189
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
'I understand how much you 
want to succeed, Miss Capaldi.

190
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,160
Don't worry...

191
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm going to talk to the people at your 
university - I think you should have a Ph.D.

192
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
for the work you've done so far...'

193
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,760
Gina raised her eyes.

194
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:59,280
'Yes, Miss Capaldi, I believe in your honesty 
and believe you are a brilliant young scientist.

195
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,800
I would very much like you to 
continue to work for us...'

196
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
Gina shut her eyes.

197
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,320
She was tod happy to speak.

198
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
'...

199
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,840
but in a different area,' Mr Dimitri added.

200
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,320
Gina opened her eyes.

201
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,080
She could hardly believe what she had heard.

202
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520
'But what about my work?' she asked.

203
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:39,680
'You may carry on if you wish,' said Mr Dimitri, 
'but you will have no money from us if you do.

204
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,800
And I think I can say that 
nobody else will help you if  

205
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,560
I have anything to say about it - and I will.'

206
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,680
Gina felt bad about losing her work.

207
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,800
But she had been offered a job - and her Ph.D.

208
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:11,200
'If you leave all your work with us, Miss Capaldi, 
we'll make sure that it is properly taken care of.

209
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,560
After all, y^u have made a discovery 
which could change the world someday.

210
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:27,840
And you can be sure that we will recognise you 
as the person behind it all when the time comes.

211
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,120
But it could take a long time.

212
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:41,840
'But right now we would like to use your clever 
brain to the full in doing important work for us.

213
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,160
And, of course, you will be safe in the 
knowledge that you have the CSBD behind you.

214
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
You will never be short of money again.

215
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,000
So why not join us, Gina? What do you say?'

216
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
Gina felt surprisingly good about the offer.

217
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,040
And I'll get recognition for my work?' Gina asked.

218
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
'Definitely' said Mr Dimitri.

219
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,520
'Mr Dimitri, I accept!'

220
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,080
There were smiles and goodbyes and, soon 
after, a happy Gina Capaldi left the room.

221
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,680
Mr Dimitri sat down, lit another cigar  

222
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,920
and watched the smoke rise up to the 
ceiling before it finally disappeared.

223
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,960
He knew that business was not good 
when people asked too many questions.

224
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,200
If people were made to be too 
smart they would do just that.

225
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,840
And once they didn't get the answers 
they wanted, they might not buy things.

226
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,840
And if they didn't buy things 
there would be no money to be made.

227
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
No-one would like that.

228
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
No-one at all.

229
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,840
Miss Capaldi's work would be put 
away somewhere nice and safe.

230
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
Somewhere secret.

231
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,920
Along with all the other dangerous ideas.

232
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:36,960
Like the car that ran on water, or the shoes that 
never wore out, or the battery that never stopped.

233
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
But he was glad to have Miss Capaldi.

234
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920
She was bright.

235
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
He ought to give her something to do.

236
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
Something that would make a lot of money.

237
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,600
He picked up his telephone.

238
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
'Miss Epstein...

239
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,400
See that Miss Capaldi is sent to 
the biological science centre.

240
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,400
I want her to be a part of 
that three-legged chicken plan.

241
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,920
She can do it, if anybody can.

242
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,840
She's one smart lady.

243
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,240
Oh, and Miss Epstein...'

244
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,720
'Yes, Mr Dimitri?' said Miss Epstein.

245
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,160
'I want you to see that a dangerous 
animal from one of our centres is killed.

246
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,760
It's a monkey.

247
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:43,840
His name is Max.'
