1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
“I reckon,” he said, “I couldn’t be so good if I wasn’t bad onced
in a while.”

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:15,880
“Why, there’s a skunk,” said I, noticing the pretty little animal
trotting in front of us at the edge of the thickets.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,840
“Oh, where is it? Don’t let me see it!” screamed Molly.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:28,280
And at this deeply feminine remark, the Virginian looked at her with such a smile that,
had I been a woman, it would have made me his to do what he pleased with on the spot.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,520
Upon the lady, however, it seemed to make less impression.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:45,680
Or rather, I had better say, whatever were her feelings, she very naturally made no display of
them, and contrived not to be aware of that expression which had passed over the Virginian’s face.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,680
It was later that these few words reached me while I was fishing
alone:⁠—

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
“Have you anything different to tell me yet?” I heard him say.


9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
“Yes; I have.”

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,040
She spoke in accents light and well intrenched.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,760
“I wish to say that I have never liked any man better than you.
But I expect to!”

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
He must have drawn small comfort from such an answer as that.


13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
But he laughed out indomitably:⁠—

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
“Don’t yu’ go betting on any such expectation!”

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,320
And then their words ceased to be distinct, and it was only their
two voices that I heard wandering among the windings of the stream.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,920
CHAPTER XXII

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
“What Is a Rustler?”

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,640
We all know what birds of a feather do.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:35,600
And it may be safely surmised that if a bird of any particular feather has been for a long while unable to see other
birds of its kind, it will flock with them all the more assiduously when they happen to alight in its vicinity.

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Now the Ogdens were birds of Molly’s feather.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:48,000
They wore Eastern, and not Western, plumage, and their song
was a different song from that which the Bear Creek birds sang.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,600
To be sure, the piping of little George Taylor was full of hopeful interest; and many other strains,
both striking and melodious, were lifted in Cattle Land, and had given pleasure to Molly’s ear.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,920
But although Indians, and bears, and mavericks, make worthy themes
for song, these are not the only songs in the world.

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,120
Therefore the Eastern warblings of the Ogdens sounded doubly
sweet to Molly Wood.

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Such words as Newport, Bar Harbor, and Tiffany’s thrilled her
exceedingly.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:26,000
It made no difference that she herself had never been to Newport or Bar
Harbor, and had visited Tiffany’s more often to admire than to purchase.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,640
On the contrary, this rather added a dazzle to the music of the
Ogdens.

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:41,240
And Molly, whose Eastern song had been silent in this strange land, began
to chirp it again during the visit that she made at the Sunk Creek Ranch.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Thus the Virginian’s cause by no means prospered at this time.


30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,120
His forces were scattered, while Molly’s were concentrated.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,960
The girl was not at that point where absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:09,720
While the Virginian was trundling his long, responsible miles in the caboose, delivering
the cattle at Chicago, vanquishing Trampas along the Yellowstone, she had regained herself.

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:18,000
Thus it was that she could tell him so easily during those first hours that they
were alone after his return, “I expect to like another man better than you.”

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,760
Absence had recruited her.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,320
And then the Ogdens had reinforced her.

36
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,240
They brought the East back powerfully to her memory, and her
thoughts filled with it.

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,520
They did not dream that they were assisting in any battle.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,280
No one ever had more unconscious allies than did Molly at that
time.

39
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,160
But she used them consciously, or almost consciously.

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:49,840
She frequented them; she spoke of Eastern matters; she found that she had acquaintances
whom the Ogdens also knew, and she often brought them into the conversation.

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
For it may be said, I think, that she was fighting a battle⁠—nay,
a campaign.

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,240
And perhaps this was a hopeful sign for the Virginian (had he
but known it), that the girl resorted to allies.

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:09,040
She surrounded herself, she steeped herself, with the East, to have, as it
were, a sort of counteractant against the spell of the black-haired horse man.

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,360
And his forces were, as I have said, scattered.

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,600
For his promotion gave him no more time for lovemaking.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,360
He was foreman now.

47
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,640
He had said to Judge Henry, “I’ll try to please yu’.”

48
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:33,040
And after the throb of emotion which these words had both concealed and conveyed,
there came to him that sort of intention to win which amounts to a certainty.

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
Yes, he would please Judge Henry!

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
He did not know how much he had already pleased him.

51
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:51,240
He did not know that the Judge was humorously undecided which of his new foreman’s first acts
had the more delighted him: his performance with the missionary, or his magnanimity to Trampas.

52
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:00,360
“Good feeling is a great thing in anyone,” the Judge would say;
“but I like to know that my foreman has so much sense.”

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,600
“I am personally very grateful to him,” said Mrs. Henry.

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,120
And indeed so was the whole company.

55
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,240
To be afflicted with Dr. MacBride for one night instead of six
was a great liberation.

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:23,440
But the Virginian never saw his sweetheart alone again; while she was at the Sunk
Creek Ranch, his duties called him away so much that there was no chance for him.

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,680
Worse still, that habit of birds of a feather brought about a
separation more considerable.

58
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,640
She arranged to go East with the Ogdens.

59
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:40,880
It was so good an opportunity to travel with friends, instead
of making the journey alone!

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Molly’s term of ministration at the schoolhouse had so pleased
Bear Creek that she was warmly urged to take a holiday.

61
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,040
School could afford to begin a little late.

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Accordingly, she departed.

63
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,240
The Virginian hid his sore heart from her during the moment of
farewell that they had.

64
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,640
“No, I’ll not want any more books,” he said, “till yu’ come back.”


65
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
And then he made cheerfulness.

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,800
“It’s just the other way round!” said he.

67
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
“What is the other way round?”

68
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,520
“Why, last time it was me that went travelling, and you that
stayed behind.”

69
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,080
“So it was!”

70
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,480
And here she gave him a last scratch.

71
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,800
“But you’ll be busier than ever,” she said; “no spare time to
grieve about me!”

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
She could wound him, and she knew it.

73
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,600
Nobody else could.

74
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,280
That is why she did it.

75
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,560
But he gave her something to remember, too.

76
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,040
“Next time,” he said, “neither of us will stay behind.

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
We’ll both go together.”

78
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,920
And with these words he gave her no laughing glance.

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:45,800
It was a look that mingled with the words; so that now and again in the train, both came back to
her, and she sat pensive, drawing near to Bennington and hearing his voice and seeing his eyes.

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:56,120
How is it that this girl could cry at having to tell Sam Bannett she could
not think of him, and then treat another lover as she treated the Virginian?

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,720
I cannot tell you, having never (as I said before) been a woman
myself.

82
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,320
Bennington opened its arms to its venturesome daughter.

83
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,640
Much was made of Molly Wood.

84
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,080
Old faces and old places welcomed her.

85
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,400
Fatted calves of varying dimensions made their appearance.

86
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:31,440
And although the fatted calf is an animal that can assume more divergent shapes than any other known creature⁠—being sometimes
champagne and partridges, and again cake and currant wine⁠—through each disguise you can always identify the same calf.

87
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,520
The girl from Bear Creek met it at every turn.

88
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,040
The Bannetts at Hoosic Falls offered a large specimen to
Molly⁠—a dinner (perhaps I should say a banquet) of twenty-four.

89
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,240
And Sam Bannett of course took her to drive more than once.

90
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,280
“I want to see the Hoosic Bridge,” she would say.

91
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,520
And when they reached that well-remembered point, “How lovely
it is!” she exclaimed.

92
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,600
And as she gazed at the view up and down the valley, she would
grow pensive.

93
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,520
“How natural the church looks,” she continued.

94
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,040
And then, having crossed both bridges, “Oh, there’s the dear
old lodge gate!”

95
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,680
Or again, while they drove up the valley of the little Hoosic:
“I had forgotten it was so nice and lonely.

96
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,120
But after all, no woods are so interesting as those where you
might possibly see a bear or an elk.”

97
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:29,280
And upon another occasion, after a cry of enthusiasm at the view from the top of Mount Anthony,
“It’s lovely, lovely, lovely,” she said, with diminishing cadence, ending in pensiveness once more.

98
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
“Do you see that little bit just there?

99
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,200
No, not where the trees are⁠—that bare spot that looks brown
and warm in the sun.

100
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,200
With a little sagebrush, that spot would look something like
a place I know on Bear Creek.

101
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Only of course you don’t get the clear air here.”

102
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
“I don’t forget you,” said Sam.

103
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,040
“Do you remember me? Or is it out of sight out of mind?”

104
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,840
And with this beginning he renewed his suit.

105
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,800
She told him that she forgot no one; that she should return always,
lest they might forget her.

106
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
“Return always!” he exclaimed.

107
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,960
“You talk as if your anchor was dragging.”

108
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,160
Was it?

109
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,560
At all events, Sam failed in his suit.

110
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,480
Over in the house at Dunbarton, the old lady held Molly’s hand
and looked a long while at her.

111
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,640
“You have changed very much,” she said finally.

112
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,440
“I am a year older,” said the girl.

113
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,720
“Pshaw, my dear!” said the great-aunt.

114
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,680
“Who is he?”

115
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,400
“Nobody!” cried Molly, with indignation.

116
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,280
“Then you shouldn’t answer so loud,” said the great-aunt.

117
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,160
The girl suddenly hid her face.

118
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,080
“I don’t believe I can love anyone,” she said, “except myself.”


119
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:59,640
And then that old lady, who in her day had made her courtesy to Lafayette,
began to stroke her niece’s buried head, because she more than half understood.

120
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:16,720
And understanding thus much, she asked no prying questions, but thought of the
days of her own youth, and only spoke a little quiet love and confidence to Molly.

121
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,400
“I am an old, old woman,” she said.

122
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,040
“But I haven’t forgotten about it.

123
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,040
They objected to him because he had no fortune.

124
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,800
But he was brave and handsome, and I loved him, my dear.

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,600
Only I ought to have loved him more.

126
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,040
I gave him my promise to think about it.

127
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,280
And he and his ship were lost.”

128
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,880
The great-aunt’s voice had become very soft and low, and she
spoke with many pauses.

129
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
“So then I knew.

130
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,200
If I had⁠—if⁠—perhaps I should have lost him; but it would have
been after⁠—ah, well!

131
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,160
So long as you can help it, never marry!

132
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,040
But when you cannot help it a moment longer, then listen to nothing but
that; for, my dear, I know your choice would be worthy of the Starks.

133
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,080
And now⁠—let me see his picture.”

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,280
“Why, aunty!” said Molly.

135
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:25,480
“Well, I won’t pretend to be supernatural,” said the aunt, “but I thought
you kept one back when you were showing us those Western views last night.”

136
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,160
Now this was the precise truth.

137
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,800
Molly had brought a number of photographs from Wyoming to show
to her friends at home.

138
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,200
These, however, with one exception, were not portraits.

139
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,520
They were views of scenery and of cattle roundups, and other
scenes characteristic of ranch life.

140
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,280
Of young men she had in her possession several photographs, and
all but one of these she had left behind her.

141
00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:03,000
Her aunt’s penetration had in a way mesmerized the girl; she
rose obediently and sought that picture of the Virginian.

142
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:15,360
It was full length, displaying him in all his cowboy trappings⁠—the
leathern chaps, the belt and pistol, and in his hand a coil of rope.

143
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,200
Not one of her family had seen it, or suspected its existence.


144
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,760
She now brought it downstairs and placed it in her aunt’s hand.


145
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
“Mercy!” cried the old lady.

146
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Molly was silent, but her eye grew warlike.

147
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
“Is that the way⁠—” began the aunt.

148
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,920
“Mercy!” she murmured; and she sat staring at the picture.

149
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,960
Molly remained silent.

150
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,120
Her aunt looked slowly up at her.

151
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,680
“Has a man like that presumed⁠—”

152
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,120
“He’s not a bit like that. Yes, he’s exactly like that,” said
Molly.

153
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,080
And she would have snatched the photograph away, but her aunt
retained it.

154
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,120
“Well,” she said, “I suppose there are days when he does not
kill people.”

155
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
“He never killed anybody!”

156
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,880
And Molly laughed.

157
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,960
“Are you seriously⁠—” said the old lady.

158
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,440
“I almost might⁠—at times . He is perfectly splendid.”

159
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,160
“My dear, you have fallen in love with his clothes.”

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,120
“It’s not his clothes. And I’m not in love. He often wears others.
He wears a white collar like anybody.”

161
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,520
“Then that would be a more suitable way to be photographed, I
think.

162
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,240
He couldn’t go round like that here.

163
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
I could not receive him myself.”

164
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,840
“He’d never think of such a thing. Why, you talk as if he were
a savage.”

165
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
The old lady studied the picture closely for a minute.

166
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,480
“I think it is a good face,” she finally remarked.

167
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
“Is the fellow as handsome as that, my dear?”

168
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,000
More so, Molly thought.

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,440
And who was he, and what were his prospects? were the aunt’s
next inquiries.

170
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,200
She shook her head at the answers which she received; and she also shook her
head over her niece’s emphatic denial that her heart was lost to this man.

171
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,720
But when their parting came, the old lady said:⁠—

172
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:13,880
“God bless you and keep you, my dear. I’ll not try to manage
you. They managed me⁠—” A sigh spoke the rest of this sentence.

173
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,640
“But I’m not worried about you⁠—at least, not very much.

174
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
You have never done anything that was not worthy of the Starks.


175
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,200
And if you’re going to take him, do it before I die so that I
can bid him welcome for your sake.

176
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,160
God bless you, my dear.”

177
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,800
And after the girl had gone back to Bennington, the great-aunt
had this thought: “She is like us all.

178
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,320
She wants a man that is a man.”

179
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,440
Nor did the old lady breathe her knowledge to any member of the
family.

180
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,120
For she was a loyal spirit, and her girl’s confidence was sacred
to her.

181
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,840
“Besides,” she reflected, “if even I can do nothing with her,
what a mess they’d make of it!

182
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,840
We should hear of her elopement next.”

183
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,600
So Molly’s immediate family never saw that photograph, and never
heard a word from her upon this subject.

184
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:14,960
But on the day that she left for Bear Creek, as they sat missing her and discussing her visit in the
evening, Mrs. Bell observed: “Mother, how did you think she was?”⁠—“I never saw her better, Sarah.

185
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,680
That horrible place seems to agree with her.”⁠—“Oh, yes, agree.


186
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:30,240
It seemed to me⁠—”⁠—“Well?”⁠—“Oh, just somehow that she was thinking.”⁠—“Thinking?”⁠—“Well,
I believe she has something on her mind.”⁠—“You mean a man,” said Andrew Bell.⁠—“A man,

187
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,040
Andrew?”⁠—“Yes, Mrs. Wood, that’s what Sarah always means.”

188
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,800
It may be mentioned that Sarah’s surmises did not greatly contribute
to her mother’s happiness.

189
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:53,720
And rumor is so strange a thing that presently from the malicious outside air came
a vague and dreadful word⁠—one of those words that cannot be traced to its source.

190
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,080
Somebody said to Andrew Bell that they heard Miss Molly Wood
was engaged to marry a rustler.

191
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,480
“Heavens, Andrew!” said his wife; “what is a rustler?”

192
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,480
It was not in any dictionary, and current translations of it
were inconsistent.

193
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:15,920
A man at Hoosic Falls said that he had passed through Cheyenne, and heard
the term applied in a complimentary way to people who were alive and pushing.

194
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,760
Another man had always supposed it meant some kind of horse.

195
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,920
But the most alarming version of all was that a rustler was a
cattle thief.

196
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,360
Now the truth is that all these meanings were right.

197
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,760
The word ran a sort of progress in the cattle country, gathering
many meanings as it went.

198
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,040
It gathered more, however, in Bennington.

199
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:53,840
In a very few days, gossip had it that Molly was engaged to a gambler, a gold miner, an
escaped stage robber, and a Mexican bandit; while Mrs. Flynt feared she had married a Mormon.

200
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Along Bear Creek, however, Molly and her “rustler” took a ride
soon after her return.

201
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,840
They were neither married nor engaged, and she was telling him
about Vermont.

202
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,280
“I never was there,” said he.

203
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,240
“Never happened to strike in that direction.”

204
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,920
“What decided your direction?”

205
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,840
“Oh, looking for chances.

206
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,520
I reckon I must have been more ambitious than my brothers⁠—or
more restless.

207
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,280
They stayed around on farms.

208
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,960
But I got out.

209
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,920
When I went back again six years afterward, I was twenty.

210
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,880
They was talking about the same old things.

211
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,680
Men of twenty-five and thirty⁠—yet just sittin’ and talkin’ about
the same old things.

212
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,960
I told my mother about what I’d seen here and there, and she
liked it, right to her death.

213
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:55,240
But the others⁠—well, when I found this whole world was hawgs and turkeys to them, with a little gunnin’ afteh small game throwed
in, I put on my hat one mawnin’ and told ’em maybe when I was fifty I’d look in on ’em again to see if they’d got any new subjects.

214
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,360
But they’ll never.

215
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
My brothers don’t seem to want chances.”

216
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,600
“You have lost a good many yourself,” said Molly.

217
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
“That’s correct.”

218
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,760
“And yet,” said she, “sometimes I think you know a great deal
more than I ever shall.”

219
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,320
“Why, of course I do,” said he, quite simply.

220
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,280
“I have earned my living since I was fourteen.

221
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,800
And that’s from old Mexico to British Columbia.

222
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,240
I have never stolen or begged a cent.

223
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,160
I’d not want yu’ to know what I know.”

224
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,120
She was looking at him, half listening and half thinking of her
great-aunt.

225
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,360
“I am not losing chances any more,” he continued.

226
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,560
“And you are the best I’ve got.”

227
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,840
She was not sorry to have Georgie Taylor come galloping along
at this moment and join them.

228
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,760
But the Virginian swore profanely under his breath.

229
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,080
And on this ride nothing more happened.

230
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,120
CHAPTER XXIII

231
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,320
Various Points

232
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Love had been snowbound for many weeks.

233
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:56,240
Before this imprisonment its course had run neither smooth nor rough, so far as eye
could see; it had run either not at all, or, as an undercurrent, deep out of sight.

234
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:07,600
In their rides, in their talks, love had been dumb, as to spoken words at least;
for the Virginian had set himself a heavy task of silence and of patience.

235
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:17,960
Then, where winter barred his visits to Bear Creek, and there was for the while no ranch work or
responsibility to fill his thoughts and blood with action, he set himself a task much lighter.

236
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:26,080
Often, instead of Shakespeare and fiction, school books lay open on
his cabin table; and penmanship and spelling helped the hours to pass.

237
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,480
Many sheets of paper did he fill with various exercises, and
Mrs. Henry gave him her assistance in advice and corrections.

238
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,800
“I shall presently be in love with him myself,” she told the
Judge.

239
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,120
“And it’s time for you to become anxious.”

240
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,600
“I am perfectly safe,” he retorted.

241
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
“There’s only one woman for him any more.”

242
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,320
“She is not good enough for him,” declared Mrs. Henry.

243
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,160
“But he’ll never see that.”

244
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,960
So the snow fell, the world froze, and the spelling-books and
exercises went on.

245
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,720
But this was not the only case of education which was progressing
at the Sunk Creek Ranch while love was snowbound.

246
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,560
One morning Scipio le Moyne entered the Virginian’s sitting room⁠—that
apartment where Dr. MacBride had wrestled with sin so courageously all night.

247
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,960
The Virginian sat at his desk.

248
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,520
Open books lay around him; a half-finished piece of writing was
beneath his fist; his fingers were coated with ink.

249
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,640
Education enveloped him, it may be said.

250
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,440
But there was none in his eye.

251
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,080
That was upon the window, looking far across the cold plain.

252
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:35,680
The foreman did not move when Scipio came in, and this humorous
spirit smiled to himself.

253
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,280
“It’s Bear Creek he’s havin’ a vision of,” he concluded.

254
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,480
But he knew instantly that this was not so.

255
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,520
The Virginian was looking at something real, and Scipio went
to the window to see for himself.

256
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,120
“Well,” he said, having seen, “when is he going to leave us?”


257
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,000
The foreman continued looking at two horsemen riding together.


258
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,600
Their shapes, small in the distance, showed black against the
universal whiteness.

259
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,800
“When d’ yu’ figure he’ll leave us?” repeated Scipio.

260
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:22,360
“He,” murmured the Virginian, always watching the distant horsemen;
and again, “he.”

261
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,760
Scipio sprawled down, familiarly, across a chair.

262
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,320
He and the Virginian had come to know each other very well since
that first meeting at Medora.

263
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,840
They were birds many of whose feathers were the same, and the
Virginian often talked to Scipio without reserve.

264
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:59,440
Consequently, Scipio now understood those two syllables that the Virginian had pronounced
precisely as though the sentences which lay between them had been fully expressed.

265
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,880
“Hm,” he remarked.

266
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,960
“Well, one will be a gain, and the other won’t be no loss.”

267
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,320
“Poor Shorty !” said the Virginian.

268
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,080
“Poor fool!”

269
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,680
Scipio was less compassionate.

270
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,360
“No,” he persisted, “I ain’t sorry for him.

271
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,640
Any man old enough to have hair on his face ought to see through
Trampas.”

272
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:30,360
The Virginian looked out of the window again, and watched Shorty
and Trampas as they rode in the distance.

273
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,200
“Shorty is kind to animals,” he said.

274
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,680
“He has gentled that hawss Pedro he bought with his first money.


275
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,200
Gentled him wonderful.

276
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,440
When a man is kind to dumb animals, I always say he had got some
good in him.”

277
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,160
“Yes,” Scipio reluctantly admitted.

278
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,720
“Yes. But I always did hate a fool.”

279
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,080
“This hyeh is a mighty cruel country,” pursued the Virginian.


280
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,960
“To animals that is.

281
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,760
Think of it!

282
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,600
Think what we do to hundreds an’ thousands of little calves!

283
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,840
Throw ’em down, brand ’em, cut ’em, ear mark ’em, turn ’em loose,
and on to the next.

284
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,560
It has got to be, of course.

285
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,360
But I say this.

286
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:21,800
If a man can go jammin’ hot irons on to little calves and slicin’ pieces off ’em with his knife,
and live along, keepin’ a kindness for animals in his heart, he has got some good in him.

287
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,480
And that’s what Shorty has got.

288
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,480
But he is lettin’ Trampas get a hold of him, and both of them
will leave us.”

289
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,240
And the Virginian looked out across the huge winter whiteness
again.

290
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,600
But the riders had now vanished behind some foothills.

291
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,440
Scipio sat silent.

292
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,560
He had never put these thoughts about men and animals to himself,
and when they were put to him, he saw that they were true.

293
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,640
“Queer,” he observed finally.

294
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:50,720
“What?”

295
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
“Everything.”

296
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,440
“Nothing’s queer,” stated the Virginian, “except marriage and
lightning.

297
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,280
Them two occurrences can still give me a sensation of surprise.”


298
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,200
“All the same it is queer,” Scipio insisted.

299
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
“Well, let her go at me.”

300
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,560
“Why, Trampas.

301
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,640
He done you dirt.

302
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,440
You pass that over.

303
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,680
You could have fired him, but you let him stay and keep his job.


304
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
That’s goodness.

305
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,680
And badness is resultin’ from it, straight.

306
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,520
Badness right from goodness.”

307
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,760
“You’re off the trail a whole lot,” said the Virginian.

308
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,280
“Which side am I off, then?”

309
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,360
“North, south, east, and west.

310
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,680
First point.

311
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:36,280
I didn’t expect to do Trampas any good by not killin’ him, which
I came pretty near doin’ three times.

312
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,800
Nor I didn’t expect to do Trampas any good by lettin’ him keep
his job.

313
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
But I am foreman of this ranch.

314
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,160
And I can sit and tell all men to their face: ‘I was above that
meanness.’

315
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:53,040
Point two: it ain’t any goodness, it is Trampas that badness
has resulted from.

316
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,280
Put him anywhere and it will be the same.

317
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,520
Put him under my eye, and I can follow his moves a little, anyway.


318
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:12,240
You have noticed, maybe, that since you and I run on to that dead Polled Angus cow, that
was still warm when we got to her, we have found no more cows dead of sudden death.

319
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,400
We came mighty close to catchin’ whoever it was that killed that
cow and ran her calf off to his own bunch.

320
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,360
He wasn’t ten minutes ahead of us.

321
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,160
We can prove nothin’; and he knows that just as well as we do.


322
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,760
But our cows have all quit dyin’ of sudden death.

323
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,040
And Trampas he’s gettin’ ready for a change of residence.

324
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,760
As soon as all the outfits begin hirin’ new hands in the spring,
Trampas will leave us and take a job with some of them.

325
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,680
And maybe our cows’ll commence gettin’ killed again, and we’ll
have to take steps that will be more emphatic⁠—maybe.”

326
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,720
Scipio meditated.

327
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,400
“I wonder what killin’ a man feels like?” he said.

328
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
“Why, nothing to bother yu’⁠—when he’d ought to have been killed.


329
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:04,240
Next point: Trampas he’ll take Shorty with him, which is certainly
bad for Shorty.

330
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,200
But it’s me that has kept Shorty out of harm’s way this long.


331
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,960
If I had fired Trampas, he’d have worked Shorty into dissatisfaction
that much sooner.”

332
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,160
Scipio meditated again.

333
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,880
“I knowed Trampas would pull his freight,” he said.

334
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,720
“But I didn’t think of Shorty. What makes you think it?”

335
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,120
“He asked me for a raise.”

336
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,080
“He ain’t worth the pay he’s getting now.”

337
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,520
“Trampas has told him different.”

338
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,120
“When a man ain’t got no ideas of his own,” said Scipio, “he’d
ought to be kind o’ careful who he borrows ’em from.”

339
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,400
“That’s mighty correct,” said the Virginian.

340
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,600
“Poor Shorty!

341
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,240
He has told me about his life.

342
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,080
It is sorrowful.

343
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,040
And he will never get wise.

344
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,680
It was too late for him to get wise when he was born.

345
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,200
D’ yu’ know why he’s after higher wages?

346
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
He sends most all his money East.”

347
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,880
“I don’t see what Trampas wants him for,” said Scipio.

348
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,800
“Oh, a handy tool some day.”

349
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,000
“Not very handy,” said Scipio.

350
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,720
“Well, Trampas is aimin’ to train him.

351
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:19,320
Yu’ see, supposin’ yu’ were figuring to turn professional thief⁠—yu’d be lookin’ around
for a nice young trustful accomplice to take all the punishment and let you take the rest.”

352
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,280
“No such thing!” cried Scipio, angrily.

353
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,120
“I’m no shirker.”

354
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,800
And then, perceiving the Virginian’s expression, he broke out
laughing.

355
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,000
“Well,” he exclaimed, “yu’ fooled me that time.”

356
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,680
“Looks that way. But I do mean it about Trampas.”

357
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,560
Presently Scipio rose, and noticed the half-finished exercise
upon the Virginian’s desk.

358
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,320
“Trampas is a rolling stone,” he said.

359
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,520
“A rolling piece of mud,” corrected the Virginian.

360
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,800
“Mud! That’s right. I’m a rolling stone. Sometimes I’d most like
to quit being.”

361
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
“That’s easy done,” said the Virginian.

362
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,040
“No doubt, when yu’ve found the moss yu’ want to gather.”

363
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,680
As Scipio glanced at the school books again, a sparkle lurked
in his bleached blue eye.

364
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,560
“I can cipher some,” he said.

365
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,400
“But I expect I’ve got my own notions about spelling.”

366
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,160
“I retain a few private ideas that way myself,” remarked the
Virginian, innocently; and Scipio’s sparkle gathered light.

367
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,920
“As to my geography,” he pursued, “that’s away out loose in the
brush.

368
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,320
Is Bennington the capital of Vermont?

369
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,280
And how d’ yu’ spell bridegroom?”

370
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:28,680
“Last point!” shouted the Virginian, letting a book fly after him: “don’t
let badness and goodness worry yu’, for yu’ll never be a judge of them.”

371
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,600
But Scipio had dodged the book, and was gone.

372
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,240
As he went his way, he said to himself, “All the same, it must
pay to fall regular in love.”

373
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,360
At the bunk house that afternoon it was observed that he was
unusually silent.

374
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:54,760
His exit from the foreman’s cabin had let in a breath of winter so chill that
the Virginian went to see his thermometer, a Christmas present from Mrs. Henry.

375
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,640
It registered twenty below zero.

376
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:07,600
After reviving the fire to a white blaze, the foreman sat thinking over the story of
Shorty: what its useless, feeble past had been; what would be its useless, feeble future.

377
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,480
He shook his head over the sombre question, Was there any way
out for Shorty?

378
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,040
“It may be,” he reflected, “that them whose pleasure brings yu’
into this world owes yu’ a living.

379
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,840
But that don’t make the world responsible.

380
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,240
The world did not beget you.

381
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,920
I reckon man helps them that help themselves.

382
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:36,840
As for the universe, it looks like it did too wholesale a business
to turn out an article up to standard every clip.

383
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,800
Yes, it is sorrowful.

384
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
For Shorty is kind to his hawss.”

385
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
In the evening the Virginian brought Shorty into his room.

386
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,920
He usually knew what he had to say, usually found it easy to arrange
his thoughts; and after such arranging the words came of themselves.

387
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,120
But as he looked at Shorty, this did not happen to him.

388
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:04,760
There was not a line of badness in the face; yet also there was not a line of strength; no
promise in eye, or nose, or chin; the whole thing melted to a stubby, featureless mediocrity.

389
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:16,840
It was a countenance like thousands; and hopelessness filled the
Virginian as he looked at this lost dog, and his dull, wistful eyes.

390
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,040
But some beginning must be made.

391
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,840
“I wonder what the thermometer has got to be,” he said.

392
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,560
“Yu’ can see it, if yu’ll hold the lamp to that right side of
the window.”

393
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,840
Shorty held the lamp.

394
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,760
“I never used any,” he said, looking out at the instrument, nevertheless.


395
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,400
The Virginian had forgotten that Shorty could not read.

396
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,360
So he looked out of the window himself, and found that it was
twenty-two below zero.

397
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,200
“This is pretty good tobacco,” he remarked; and Shorty helped
himself, and filled his pipe.

398
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,560
“I had to rub my left ear with snow today,” said he.

399
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,360
“I was just in time.”

400
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,000
“I thought it looked pretty freezy out where yu’ was riding,”
said the foreman.

401
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,880
The lost dog’s eyes showed plain astonishment.

402
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
“We didn’t see you out there,” said he.

403
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,800
“Well,” said the foreman, “it’ll soon not be freezing any more;
and then we’ll all be warm enough with work.

404
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,520
Everybody will be working all over the range.

405
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,160
And I wish I knew somebody that had a lot of stable work to be
attended to.

406
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,680
I cert’nly do for your sake.”

407
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,120
“Why?” said Shorty.

408
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,760
“Because it’s the right kind of a job for you.”

409
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,960
“I can make more⁠—” began Shorty, and stopped.

410
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,000
“There is a time coming,” said the Virginian, “when I’ll want
somebody that knows how to get the friendship of hawsses.

411
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,600
I’ll want him to handle some special hawsses the Judge has plans
about.

412
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,480
Judge Henry would pay fifty a month for that.”

413
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,120
“I can make more,” said Shorty, this time with stubbornness.

414
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,400
“Well, yes. Sometimes a man can⁠—when he’s not worth it, I mean.
But it don’t generally last.”

415
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,720
Shorty was silent.

416
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,960
“I used to make more myself,” said the Virginian.

417
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,520
“You’re making a lot more now,” said Shorty.

418
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,280
“Oh, yes.

419
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:58,760
But I mean when I was fooling around the earth, jumping from
job to job, and helling all over town between whiles.

420
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,640
I was not worth fifty a month then, nor twenty-five.

421
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
But there was nights I made a heap more at cyards.”

422
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,840
Shorty’s eyes grew large.

423
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,960
“And then, bang! it was gone with treatin’ the men and the girls.”


424
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,160
“I don’t always⁠—” said Shorty, and stopped again.

425
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,800
The Virginian knew that he was thinking about the money he sent
East.

426
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,040
“After a while,” he continued, “I noticed a right strange fact.


427
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
The money I made easy that I wasn’t worth, it went like it came.


428
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,080
I strained myself none gettin’ or spendin’ it.

429
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,520
But the money I made hard that I was worth, why I began to feel
right careful about that.

430
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,400
And now I have got savings stowed away.

431
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,200
If once yu’ could know how good that feels⁠—”

432
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,880
“So I would know,” said Shorty, “with your luck.”

433
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,640
“What’s my luck?” said the Virginian, sternly.

434
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:47,200
“Well, if I had took up land along a creek that never goes dry and proved upon it like
you have, and if I had saw that land raise its value on me with me lifting no finger⁠—”

435
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,720
“Why did you lift no finger?” cut in the Virginian.

436
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,440
“Who stopped yu’ taking up land?

437
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,680
Did it not stretch in front of yu’, behind yu’, all around yu’,
the biggest, baldest opportunity in sight?

438
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,000
That was the time I lifted my finger; but yu’ didn’t.”

439
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,480
Shorty stood stubborn.

440
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,120
“But never mind that,” said the Virginian.

441
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,080
“Take my land away tomorrow, and I’d still have my savings in
bank.

442
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,160
Because, you see, I had to work right hard gathering them in.


443
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,720
I found out what I could do, and I settled down and did it.

444
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,120
Now you can do that too.

445
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,920
The only tough part is the finding out what you’re good for.

446
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,280
And for you, that is found.

447
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:29,920
If you’ll just decide to work at this thing you can do, and gentle those
hawsses for the Judge, you’ll be having savings in a bank yourself.”

448
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,840
“I can make more,” said the lost dog.

449
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,080
The Virginian was on the point of saying, “Then get out!”

450
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,640
But instead, he spoke kindness to the end.

451
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,360
“The weather is freezing yet,” he said, “and it will be for a
good long while.

452
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,400
Take your time, and tell me if yu’ change your mind.”

453
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:58,600
After that Shorty returned to the bunk house, and the Virginian knew that the boy had
learned his lesson of discontent from Trampas with a thoroughness past all unteaching.

454
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,120
This petty triumph of evil seemed scarce of the size to count
as any victory over the Virginian.

455
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,400
But all men grasp at straws.

456
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:28,200
Since that first moment, when in the Medicine Bow saloon the Virginian had shut the mouth of Trampas by a word, the man had been trying
to get even without risk; and at each successive clash of his weapon with the Virginian’s, he had merely met another public humiliation.

457
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Therefore, now at the Sunk Creek Ranch in these cold white days, a certain lurking insolence in
his gait showed plainly his opinion that by disaffecting Shorty he had made some sort of reprisal.

458
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,840
Yes, he had poisoned the lost dog.

459
00:34:45,840 --> 00:35:01,800
In the springtime, when the neighboring ranches needed additional hands, it happened as the Virginian had foreseen⁠—Trampas
departed to a “better job,” as he took pains to say, and with him the docile Shorty rode away upon his horse Pedro.

460
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,960
Love now was not any longer snowbound.

461
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,960
The mountain trails were open enough for the sure feet of love’s
steed⁠—that horse called Monte.

462
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,080
But duty blocked the path of love.

463
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:19,520
Instead of turning his face to Bear Creek, the foreman had other journeys
to make, full of heavy work, and watchfulness, and councils with the Judge.

464
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,520
The cattle thieves were growing bold, and winter had scattered
the cattle widely over the range.

465
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,360
Therefore the Virginian, instead of going to see her, wrote a
letter to his sweetheart.

466
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,160
It was his first.

467
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,360
CHAPTER XXIV

468
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,520
A Letter with a Moral

469
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,880
The letter which the Virginian wrote to Molly Wood was, as has
been stated, the first that he had ever addressed to her.

470
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:57,320
I think, perhaps, he may have been a little shy as to his skill in the epistolary art, a little anxious lest any
sustained production from his pen might contain blunders that would too staringly remind her of his scant learning.

471
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:12,680
He could turn off a business communication about steers or stock cars, or any other of the subjects involved in his
profession, with a brevity and a clearness that led the Judge to confide three-quarters of such correspondence to his foreman.

472
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:27,240
“Write to the 76 outfit,” the Judge would say, “and tell them that my wagon cannot start for the roundup
until,” etc.; or “Write to Cheyenne and say that if they will hold a meeting next Monday week, I will,” etc.

473
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,400
And then the Virginian would write such communications with ease.


474
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,320
But his first message to his lady was scarcely written with ease.


475
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,480
It must be classed, I think, among those productions which are
styled literary efforts.

476
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,480
It was completed in pencil before it was copied in ink; and that first
draft of it in pencil was well-nigh illegible with erasures and amendments.

477
00:36:49,480 --> 00:37:00,640
The state of mind of the writer during its composition may be gathered without further
description on my part from a slight interruption which occurred in the middle.

478
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,360
The door opened, and Scipio put his head in.

479
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,480
“You coming to dinner?” he inquired.

480
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,840
“You go to hell,” replied the Virginian.

481
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,600
“My jinks!” said Scipio, quietly, and he shut the door without
further observation.

482
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:20,400
To tell the truth, I doubt if this letter would ever have been undertaken, far less
completed and despatched, had not the lover’s heart been wrung with disappointment.

483
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,960
All winter long he had looked to that day when he should knock
at the girl’s door, and hear her voice bid him come in.

484
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,520
All winter long he had been choosing the ride he would take her.


485
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:40,280
He had imagined a sunny afternoon, a hidden grove, a sheltering cleft of rock, a running
spring, and some words of his that should conquer her at last and leave his lips upon hers.

486
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:52,320
And with this controlled fire pent up within him, he had counted the days, scratching
them off his calendar with a dig each night that once or twice snapped the pen.

487
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:00,520
Then, when the trail stood open, this meeting was deferred, put
off for indefinite days, or weeks; he could not tell how long.

488
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:08,440
So, gripping his pencil and tracing heavy words, he gave himself
what consolation he could by writing her.

489
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:16,440
The letter, duly stamped and addressed to Bear Creek, set forth
upon its travels; and

490
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,320
these were devious and long.

491
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,880
When it reached its destination, it was some twenty days old.


492
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:39,240
It had gone by private hand at the outset, taken the stagecoach at a way point, become late in that stagecoach, reached a point
of transfer, and waited there for the postmaster to begin, continue, end, and recover from a game of poker, mingled with whiskey.

493
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,200
Then it once more proceeded, was dropped at the right way point,
and carried by private hand to Bear Creek.

494
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,680
The experience of this letter, however, was not at all a remarkable
one at that time in Wyoming.

495
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,800
Molly Wood looked at the envelope.

496
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,560
She had never before seen the Virginian’s handwriting.

497
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,640
She knew it instantly.

498
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,960
She closed her door and sat down to read it with a beating heart.


499
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,400
Sunk Creek Ranch,

500
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,080
May 5, 188‒

501
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,680
My Dear Miss Wood:

502
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
I am sorry about this.

503
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,800
My plan was different.

504
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,200
It was to get over for a ride with you about now or sooner.

505
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,360
This year Spring is early.

506
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:17,480
The snow is off the flats this side the range and where the sun gets a chance
to hit the earth strong all day it is green and has flowers too, a good many.

507
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,080
You can see them bob and mix together in the wind.

508
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,360
The quaking-asps down low on the South side are in small leaf
and will soon be twinkling like the flowers do now.

509
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,520
I had planned to take a look at this with you and that was a
better plan than what I have got to do.

510
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:39,280
The water is high but I could have got over and as for the snow on top of the mountain
a man told me nobody could cross it for a week yet, because he had just done it himself.

511
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,440
Was not he a funny man?

512
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,840
You ought to see how the birds have streamed across the sky while
Spring was coming.

513
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,320
But you have seen them on your side of the mountain.

514
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,160
But I can’t come now Miss Wood.

515
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,600
There is a lot for me to do that has to be done and Judge Henry
needs more than two eyes just now.

516
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,400
I could not think much of myself if I left him for my own wishes.


517
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,960
But the days will be warmer when I come.

518
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,080
We will not have to quit by five, and we can get off and sit
too.

519
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,920
We could not sit now unless for a very short while.

520
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,440
If I know when I can come I will try to let you know, but I think
it will be this way.

521
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,480
I think you will just see me coming for I have things to do of
an unsure nature and a good number of such.

522
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,880
Do not believe reports about Indians.

523
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,280
They are started by editors to keep the soldiers in the country.


524
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,360
The friends of the editors get the hay and beef contracts.

525
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,200
Indians do not come to settled parts like Bear Creek is.

526
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,520
It is all editors and politicianists.

527
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,160
Nothing has happened worth telling you.

528
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,480
I have read that play Othello.

529
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,160
No man should write down such a thing.

530
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,640
Do you know if it is true?

531
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,520
I have seen one worse affair down in Arizona.

532
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,960
He killed his little child as well as his wife but such things
should not be put down in fine language for the public.

533
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
I have read Romeo and Juliet.

534
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,600
That is beautiful language but Romeo is no man.

535
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,920
I like his friend Mercutio that gets killed.

536
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,440
He is a man.

537
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,280
If he had got Juliet there would have been no foolishness and
trouble.

538
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,000
Well Miss Wood I would like to see you today.

539
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,920
Do you know what I think Monte would do if I rode him out and
let the rein slack?

540
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,320
He would come straight to your gate for he is a horse of great
judgement.

541
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,360
(“That’s the first word he has misspelled,” said Molly.)

542
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,440
I suppose you are sitting with George Taylor and those children
right now.

543
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:55,320
Then George will get old enough to help his father but Uncle Hewie’s twins will be ready for you about
then and the supply will keep coming from all quarters all sizes for you to say big A little a to them.

544
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,760
There is no news here.

545
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,320
Only calves and cows and the hens are laying now which does always
seem news to a hen every time she does it.

546
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,520
Did I ever tell you about a hen Emily we had here?

547
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:14,520
She was venturesome to an extent I have not seen in other hens
only she had poor judgement and would make no family ties.

548
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:28,240
She would keep trying to get interest in the ties of others taking charge of little chicks
and bantams and turkeys and puppies one time, and she thought most anything was an egg.

549
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,800
I will tell you about her sometime.

550
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:37,320
She died without family ties one day while I was building a house
for her to teach school in.

551
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,480
(“The outrageous wretch!” cried Molly!

552
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,840
And her cheeks turned deep pink as she sat alone with her lover’s
letter.)

553
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,200
I am coming the first day I am free.

554
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:53,600
I will be a hundred miles from you most of the time when I am not more
but I will ride a hundred miles for one hour and Monte is up to that.

555
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,760
After never seeing you for so long I will make one hour do if
I have to.

556
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,640
Here is a flower I have just been out and picked.

557
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,320
I have kissed it now.

558
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,160
That is the best I can do yet.

559
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,880
Molly laid the letter in her lap and looked at the flower.

560
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,200
Then suddenly she jumped up and pressed it to her lips, and after
a long moment held it away from her.

561
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,520
“No,” she said.

562
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,320
“No, no, no.”

563
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,160
She sat down.

564
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,760
It was some time before she finished the letter.

565
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,400
Then once more she got up and put on her hat.

566
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,320
Mrs. Taylor wondered where the girl could be walking so fast.


567
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:30,920
But she was not walking anywhere, and in half an hour she returned, rosy with
her swift exercise, but with a spirit as perturbed as when she had set out.

568
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:37,480
Next morning at six, when she looked out of her window, there
was Monte tied to the Taylor’s gate.

569
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:46,280
Ah, could he have come the day before, could she have found him
when she returned from that swift walk of hers!

570
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,480
CHAPTER XXV

571
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,560
Progress of the Lost Dog

572
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,720
It was not even an hour’s visit that the Virginian was able to
pay his lady love.

573
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,880
But neither had he come a hundred miles to see her.

574
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:04,000
The necessities of his wandering work had chanced to bring him close
enough for a glimpse of her, and this glimpse he took, almost on the wing.

575
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,200
For he had to rejoin a company of men at once.

576
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,520
“Yu’ got my letter?” he said.

577
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,920
“Yesterday.”

578
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,800
“Yesterday!

579
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
I wrote it three weeks ago.

580
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,160
Well, yu’ got it.

581
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,400
This cannot be the hour with you that I mentioned.

582
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,080
That is coming, and maybe very soon.”

583
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,920
She could say nothing.

584
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,640
Relief she felt, and yet with it something like a pang.

585
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,920
“Today does not count,” he told her, “except that every time
I see you counts with me.

586
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,640
But this is not the hour that I mentioned.”

587
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,000
What little else was said between them upon this early morning
shall be told duly.

588
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,880
For this visit in its own good time did count momentously, though
both of them took it lightly while its fleeting minutes passed.

589
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:52,200
He returned to her two volumes that she had lent him long ago and
with Taylor he left a horse which he had brought for her to ride.

590
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,120
As a goodbye, he put a bunch of flowers in her hand.

591
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,840
Then he was gone, and she watched him going by the thick bushes
along the stream.

592
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:12,880
They were pink with wild roses; and the meadowlarks, invisible in the grass, like
hiding choristers, sent up across the empty miles of air their unexpected song.

593
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,840
Earth and sky had been propitious, could he have stayed; and
perhaps one portion of her heart had been propitious too.

594
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:30,200
So, as he rode away on Monte, she watched him, half chilled by reason,
half melted by passion, self-thwarted, self-accusing, unresolved.

595
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:40,440
Therefore the days that came for her now were all of them unhappy ones, while
for him they were filled with work well done and with changeless longing.

596
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:48,440
One day it seemed as if a lull was coming, a pause in which he
could at last attain that hour with her.

597
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,640
He left the camp and turned his face toward Bear Creek.

598
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
The way led him along Butte Creek.

599
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,480
Across the stream lay Balaam’s large ranch;

600
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:07,680
and presently on the other bank he saw Balaam himself, and reined
in Monte for a moment to watch what Balaam was doing.

601
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,560
“That’s what I’ve heard,” he muttered to himself.

602
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,960
For Balaam had led some horses to the water, and was lashing
them heavily because they would not drink.

603
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,000
He looked at this spectacle so intently that he did not see Shorty
approaching along the trail.

604
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,480
“Morning,” said Shorty to him, with some constraint.

605
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,840
But the Virginian gave him a pleasant greeting, “I was afraid
I’d not catch you so quick,” said Shorty.

606
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,200
“This is for you.”

607
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,680
He handed his recent foreman a letter of much battered appearance.


608
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,160
It was from the Judge.

609
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:49,040
It had not come straight, but very gradually, in the pockets
of three successive cowpunchers.

610
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,280
As the Virginian glanced over it and saw that the enclosure it
contained was for Balaam, his heart fell.

611
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,280
Here were new orders for him, and he could not go to see his
sweetheart.

612
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,720
“Hello, Shorty!” said Balaam, from over the creek.

613
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,280
To the Virginian he gave a slight nod.

614
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,080
He did not know him, although he knew well enough who he was.


615
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,440
“Hyeh’s a letter from Judge Henry for yu’ ” said the Virginian,
and he crossed the creek.

616
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:22,040
Many weeks before, in the early spring, Balaam had borrowed two
horses from the Judge, promising to return them at once.

617
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,000
But the Judge, of course, wrote very civilly.

618
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,440
He hoped that “this dunning reminder” might be excused.

619
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,400
As Balaam read the reminder, he wished that he had sent the horses
before.

620
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,000
The Judge was a greater man than he in the Territory.

621
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,400
Balaam could not but excuse the “dunning reminder,”⁠—but he was
ready to be disagreeable to somebody at once.

622
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,320
“Well,” he said, musing aloud in his annoyance, “Judge Henry
wants them by the 30th.

623
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,840
Well, this is the 24th, and time enough yet.”

624
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,160
“This is the 27th,” said the Virginian, briefly.

625
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,120
That made a difference!

626
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,240
Not so easy to reach Sunk Creek in good order by the 30th!

627
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,360
Balaam had drifted three sunrises behind the progress of the
month.

628
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,600
Days look alike, and often lose their very names in the quiet
depths of Cattle Land.

629
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,880
The horses were not even here at the ranch.

630
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,920
Balaam was ready to be very disagreeable now.

631
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,440
Suddenly he perceived the date of the Judge’s letter.

632
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,600
He held it out to the Virginian, and struck the paper.

633
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,720
“What’s your idea in bringing this here two weeks late?” he said.


634
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,200
Now, when he had struck that paper, Shorty looked at the Virginian.


635
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,640
But nothing happened beyond a certain change of light in the
Southerner’s eyes.

636
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,360
And when the Southerner spoke, it was with his usual gentleness
and civility.

637
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,480
He explained that the letter had been put in his hands just now
by Shorty.

638
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,520
“Oh,” said Balaam.

639
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,480
He looked at Shorty.

640
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,640
How had he come to be a messenger?

641
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,760
“You working for the Sunk Creek outfit again?” said he.

642
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,520
“No,” said Shorty.

643
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,720
Balaam turned to the Virginian again. “How do you expect me to
get those horses to Sunk Creek by the 30th?”

644
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,960
The Virginian levelled a lazy eye on Balaam.

645
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,160
“I ain’ doin’ any expecting,” said he.

646
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,960
His native dialect was on top today.

647
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,240
“The Judge has friends goin’ to arrive from New Yawk for a trip
across the Basin,” he added.

648
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,960
“The hawsses are for them.”

649
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:23,480
Balaam grunted with displeasure, and thought of the sixty or seventy
days since he had told the Judge he would return the horses at once.

650
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:33,200
He looked across at Shorty seated in the shade, and through his uneasy
thoughts his instinct irrelevantly noted what a good pony the youth rode.

651
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,360
It was the same animal he had seen once or twice before.

652
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,400
But something must be done.

653
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:48,440
The Judge’s horses were far out on the big range, and must be found and driven
in, which would take certainly the rest of this day, possibly part of the next.

654
00:49:48,440 --> 00:50:03,800
Balaam called to one of his men and gave some sharp orders, emphasizing details, and enjoining haste, while the Virginian
leaned slightly against his horse, with one arm over the saddle, hearing and understanding, but not smiling outwardly.

655
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:10,800
The man departed to saddle up for his search on the big range,
and Balaam resumed the unhitching of his team.

656
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,680
“So you’re not working for the Sunk Creek outfit now?” he inquired
of Shorty.

657
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,440
He ignored the Virginian.

658
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,560
“Working for the Goose Egg?”

659
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,200
“No,” said Shorty.

660
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,240
“Sand Hill outfit, then?”

661
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,080
“No,” said Shorty.

662
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
Balaam grinned.

663
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:36,920
He noticed how Shorty’s yellow hair stuck through a hole in his
hat, and how old and battered were Shorty’s overalls.

664
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:45,640
Shorty had been glad to take a little accidental pay for becoming
the bearer of the letter which he had delivered to the Virginian.

665
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,800
But even that sum was no longer in his possession.

666
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:56,280
He had passed through Drybone on his way, and at Drybone there
had been a game of poker.

667
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,400
Shorty’s money was now in the pocket of Trampas.

668
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:08,240
But he had one valuable possession in the world left to him,
and that was his horse Pedro.

669
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,480
“Good pony of yours,” said Balaam to him now, from across Butte
Creek.

670
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:21,840
Then he struck his own horse in the jaw because he held back
from coming to the water as the other had done.

671
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:28,120
“Your trace ain’t unhitched,” commented the Virginian, pointing.


672
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,720
Balaam loosed the strap he had forgotten, and cut the horse again
for consistency’s sake.

673
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,680
The animal, bewildered, now came down to the water, with its
head in the air, and snuffing as it took short, nervous steps.

674
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,680
The Virginian looked on at this, silent and sombre.

675
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,200
He could scarcely interfere between another man and his own beast.


676
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,760
Neither he nor Balaam was among those who say their prayers.

677
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,200
Yet in this omission they were not equal.

678
00:51:51,200 --> 00:52:05,440
A half-great poet once had a wholly great day, and in that great day he was
able to write a poem that has lived and become, with many, a household word.

679
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,240
He called it The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

680
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:13,760
And it is rich with many lines that possess the memory; but these
are the golden ones:⁠—

681
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,160
“He prayeth well who loveth wellBoth man and bird and beast.

682
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:29,400
He prayeth best who loveth bestAll things both great and small;For
the dear God who loveth us,He made and loveth all.”

683
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,640
These lines are the pure gold.

684
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:40,680
They are good to teach children; because after the children come
to be men, they may believe at least some part of them still.

685
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,480
The Virginian did not know them⁠—but his heart had taught him
many things.

686
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,960
I doubt if Balaam knew them either.

687
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,200
But on him they would have been as pearls to swine.

688
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,640
“So you’ve quit the roundup?” he resumed to Shorty.

689
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,640
Shorty nodded and looked sidewise at the Virginian.

690
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,920
For the Virginian knew that he had been turned off for going
to sleep while night-herding.

691
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Then Balaam threw another glance on Pedro the horse.

692
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,320
“Hello, Shorty!” he called out, for the boy was departing.

693
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,800
“Don’t you like dinner any more? It’s ready about now.”

694
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:30,200
Shorty forded the creek and slung his saddle off, and on
invitation turned Pedro, his buckskin pony, into Balaam’s pasture.

695
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:38,800
This was green, the rest of the wide world being yellow, except only where Butte Creek, with
its bordering cottonwoods, coiled away into the desert distance like a green snake without end.

696
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,760
The Virginian also turned his horse into the pasture.

697
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,440
He must stay at the ranch till the Judge’s horses should be found.


698
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,760
“Mrs. Balaam’s East yet ,” said her lord, leading the way to
his dining room.

699
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,800
He wanted Shorty to dine with him, and could not exclude the
Virginian, much as he should have enjoyed this.

700
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,960
“See any Indians?” he enquired.

701
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,720
“Na-a!” said Shorty, in disdain of recent rumors.

702
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,720
“They’re headin’ the other way,” observed the Virginian.

703
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,200
“Bow Laig Range is where they was repawted.”

704
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:20,800
“What business have they got off the reservation, I’d like to
know,” said the ranchman, “Bow Leg, or anywhere?”

705
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:27,640
“Oh, it’s just a hunt, and a kind of visitin’ their friends on
the South Reservation,” Shorty explained.

706
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,440
“Squaws along and all.”

707
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:41,000
“Well, if the folks at Washington don’t keep squaws and all where they belong,” said Balaam,
in a rage, “the folks in Wyoming Territory ’ill do a little job that way themselves.”

708
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,640
“There’s a petition out,” said Shorty.

709
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:49,880
“Paper’s goin’ East with a lot of names to it . But they ain’t
no harm, them Indians ain’t.”

710
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,080
“No harm?” rasped out Balaam.

711
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,960
“Was it white men druv off the O.C. yearlings?”

712
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,320
Balaam’s Eastern grammar was sometimes at the mercy of his Western
feelings.

713
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:10,480
The thought of the perennial stultification of Indian affairs at Washington,
whether by politician or philanthropist, was always sure to arouse him.

714
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,520
He walked impatiently about while he spoke, and halted impatiently
at the window.

715
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:26,480
Out in the world the unclouded day was shining, and Balaam’s eye travelled across the
plains to where a blue line, faint and pale, lay along the end of the vast yellow distance.

716
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,040
That was the beginning of the Bow Leg Mountains.

717
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,240
Somewhere over there were the red men, ranging in unfrequented
depths of rock and pine⁠—their forbidden ground.

718
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,120
Dinner was ready, and they sat down.

719
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:45,280
“And I suppose,” Balaam continued, still hot on the subject, “you’d claim Indians
object to killing a white man when they run on to him good and far from human help?

720
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,120
These peaceable Indians are just the worst in the business.”

721
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:55,280
“That’s so,” assented the easy-opinioned Shorty, exactly as if
he had always maintained this view.

722
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,640
“Chap started for Sunk Creek three weeks ago.

723
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,680
Trapper he was; old like, with a red shirt.

724
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,960
One of his horses come into the roundup Toosday.

725
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,560
Man ain’t been heard from.”

726
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,720
He ate in silence for a while, evidently brooding in his childlike
mind.

727
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Then he said, querulously, “I’d sooner trust one of them Indians
than I would Trampas.”

728
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:23,280
Balaam slanted his fat bullet head far to one side, and laying his spoon down (he had
opened some canned grapes) laughed steadily at his guest with a harsh relish of irony.

729
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,080
The guest ate a grape, and perceiving he was seen through, smiled
back rather miserably.

730
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:33,680
“Say, Shorty,” said Balaam, his head still slanted over, “what’s
the figures of your bank balance just now?”

731
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,720
“I ain’t usin’ banks,” murmured the youth.

732
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:43,880
Balaam put some more grapes on Shorty’s plate, and drawing a
cigar from his waistcoat, sent it rolling to his guest.

733
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,240
“Matches are behind you,” he added.

734
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:54,160
He gave a cigar to the Virginian as an afterthought, but to his
disgust, the Southerner put it in his pocket and lighted a pipe.

735
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,760
Balaam accompanied his guest, Shorty, when he went to the pasture
to saddle up and depart.

736
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,720
“Got a rope?” he asked the guest, as they lifted down the bars.


737
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,760
“Don’t need to rope him. I can walk right up to Pedro. You stay
back.”

738
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:25,560
Hiding his bridle behind him, Shorty walked to the riverbank, where the pony was switching his long tail in the shade; and speaking
persuasively to him, he came nearer, till he laid his hand on Pedro’s dusky mane, which was many shades darker than his hide.

739
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,720
He turned expectantly, and his master came up to his expectations
with a piece of bread.

740
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,720
“Eats that, does he?” said Balaam, over the bars.

741
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,240
“Likes the salt,” said Shorty.

742
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,000
“Now, n-n-ow, here!

743
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,040
Yu’ don’t guess yu’ll be bridled, don’t you?

744
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,400
Open your teeth!

745
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,840
Yu’d like to play yu’ was nobody’s horse and live private?

746
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,160
Or maybe yu’d prefer ownin’ a saloon?”

747
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,360
Pedro evidently enjoyed this talk, and the dodging he made about
the bit.

748
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,840
Once fairly in his mouth, he accepted the inevitable, and followed
Shorty to the bars.

749
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,880
Then Shorty turned and extended his hand.

750
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:09,880
“Shake!” he said to his pony, who lifted his forefoot quietly
and put it in his master’s hand.

751
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:16,080
Then the master tickled his nose, and he wrinkled it and flattened
his ears, pretending to bite.

752
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,240
His face wore an expression of knowing relish over this performance.


753
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,800
“Now the other hoof,” said Shorty; and the horse and master shook
hands with their left.

754
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:32,120
“I learned him that,” said the cowboy, with pride and affection.


755
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:37,880
“Say, Pede,” he continued, in Pedro’s ear, “ain’t yu’ the best
little horse in the country?

756
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,160
What?

757
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,720
Here, now!

758
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,360
Keep out of that, you deadbeat!

759
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,280
There ain’t no more bread.”

760
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,280
He pinched the pony’s nose, one quarter of which was wedged into
his pocket.

761
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,440
“Quite a lady’s little pet!” said Balaam, with the rasp in his
voice.

762
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,360
“Pity this isn’t New York, now, where there’s a big market for
harmless horses.

763
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,960
Gee-gees, the children call them.”

764
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,640
“He ain’t no gee-gee,” said Shorty, offended.

765
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,680
“He’ll beat any cow-pony workin’ you’ve got.

766
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,240
Yu’ can turn him on a half-dollar.

767
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,840
Don’t need to touch the reins.

768
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,400
Hang ’em on one finger and swing your body, and he’ll turn.”

769
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,360
Balaam knew this, and he knew that the pony was only a four-year-old.


770
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,760
“Well,” he said, “Drybone’s had no circus this season.

771
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,760
Maybe they’d buy tickets to see Pedro.

772
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,280
He’s good for that, anyway.”

773
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,120
Shorty became gloomy.

774
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,840
The Virginian was grimly smoking.

775
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,320
Here was something else going on not to his taste, but none of
his business.

776
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,520
“Try a circus,” persisted Balaam.

777
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:39,600
“Alter your plans for spending cash in town, and make a little
money instead.”

778
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,560
Shorty having no plans to alter and no cash to spend, grew still
more gloomy.

779
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,920
“What’ll you take for that pony?” said Balaam.

780
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,640
Shorty spoke up instantly.

781
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:56,920
“A hundred dollars couldn’t buy that piece of stale mud off
his back,” he asserted, looking off into the sky grandiosely.

782
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,640
But Balaam looked at Shorty, “You keep the mud,” he said, “and
I’ll give you thirty dollars for the horse.”

783
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,320
Shorty did a little professional laughing, and began to walk
toward his saddle.

784
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,840
“Give you thirty dollars,” repeated Balaam, picking a stone up
and slinging it into the river.

785
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:19,320
“How far do yu’ call it to Drybone?” Shorty remarked, stooping to investigate the
bucking-strap on his saddle⁠—a superfluous performance, for Pedro never bucked.

786
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,440
“You won’t have to walk,” said Balaam.

787
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,000
“Stay all night, and I’ll send you over comfortably in the morning,
when the wagon goes for the mail.”

788
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,360
“Walk?” Shorty retorted.

789
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:35,560
“Drybone’s twenty-five miles. Pedro’ll put me there in three
hours and not know he done it.”

790
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,160
He lifted the saddle on the horse’s back.

791
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,240
“Come, Pedro,” said he.

792
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,200
“Come, Pedro!” mocked Balaam.

793
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,040
There followed a little silence.

794
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:50,920
“No, sir,” mumbled Shorty, with his head under Pedro’s belly,
busily cinching.

795
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,520
“A hundred dollars is bottom figures.”

796
01:00:52,520 --> 01:01:00,080
Balaam, in his turn, now duly performed some professional laughing,
which was noted by Shorty under the horse’s belly.

797
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,280
He stood up and squared round on Balaam.

798
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,320
“Well, then,” he said, “what’ll yu give for him?”

799
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,840
“Thirty dollars,” said Balaam, looking far off into the sky,
as Shorty had looked.

800
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,440
“Oh, come, now,” expostulated Shorty.

801
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,400
It was he who now did the feeling for an offer and this was what
Balaam liked to see.

802
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,240
“Why yes,” he said, “thirty,” and looked surprised that he should
have to mention the sum so often

803
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,240
.

804
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,240
“I thought yu’d quit them first figures,” said the cowpuncher,
“for yu’ can see I ain’t goin’ to look at em.”

805
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:31,720
Balaam climbed on the fence and sat there “I’m not crying for
your Pedro,” he observed dispassionately.

806
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:39,760
“Only it struck me you were dead broke, and wanted to raise cash and
keep yourself going till you hunted up a job and could buy him back.”

807
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,640
He hooked his right thumb inside his waistcoat pocket.

808
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,920
“But I’m not cryin’ for him,” he repeated.

809
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:54,480
“He’d stay right here, of course. I wouldn’t part with him. Why
does he stand that way? Hello!”

810
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,960
Balaam suddenly straightened himself, like a man who has made
a discovery.

811
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,680
“Hello, what?” said Shorty, on the defensive.

812
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,640
Balaam was staring at Pedro with a judicial frown.

813
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,600
Then he stuck out a finger at the horse, keeping the thumb hooked
in his pocket.

814
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:15,200
So meagre a gesture was felt by the ruffled Shorty to be no just
way to point at Pedro.

815
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,240
“What’s the matter with that foreleg there?” said Balaam.

816
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,040
“Which? Nothin’s the matter with it!” snapped Shorty.

817
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,120
Balaam climbed down from his fence and came over with elaborate
deliberation.

818
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,400
He passed his hand up and down the off foreleg.

819
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,240
Then he spit slenderly.

820
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:43,040
“Mm!” he said thoughtfully; and added, with a shade of sadness,
“that’s always to be expected when they’re worked too young.”

821
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,800
Shorty slid his hand slowly over the disputed leg.

822
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,640
“What’s to be expected?” he inquired⁠—“that they’ll eat hearty?


823
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,680
Well, he does.”

824
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,680
At this retort the Virginian permitted himself to laugh in audible
sympathy.

825
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,240
“Sprung,” continued Balaam, with a sigh.

826
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,240
“Whirling round short when his bones were soft did that. Yes.”


827
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,400
“Sprung!” Shorty said, with a bark of indignation.

828
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,080
“Come on, Pede; you and me’ll spring for town.”

829
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,920
He caught the horn of the saddle, and as he swung into place
the horse rushed away with him.

830
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:22,160
“O-ee! yoi-yup, yup, yup!” sang Shorty, in the shrill cow dialect.


831
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:33,360
He made Pedro play an exhibition game of speed, bringing him round close to
Balaam in a wide circle, and then he vanished in dust down the left-bank trail.

832
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,320
Balaam looked after him and laughed harshly.

833
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:47,600
He had seen trout dash about like that when the hook in their
jaw first surprised them.

834
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:54,880
He knew Shorty would show the pony off, and he knew Shorty’s
love for Pedro was not equal to his need of money.

835
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:08,960
He called to one of his men, asked something about the dam at the mouth of the canyon, where the main irrigation ditch began,
made a remark about the prolonged drought, and then walked to his dining-room door, where, as he expected, Shorty met him.

836
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,760
“Say,” said the youth, “do you consider that’s any way to talk
about a good horse?”

837
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,760
“Any dude could see the leg’s sprung,” said Balaam.

838
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:29,280
But he looked at Pedro’s shoulder, which was well laid back; and he admired his
points, dark in contrast with the buckskin, and also the width between the eyes.

839
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,800
“Now you know,” whined Shorty, “that it ain’t sprung any more
than your leg’s cork.

840
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:39,440
If you mean the right leg ain’t plumb straight, I can tell you
he was born so.

841
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,640
That don’t make no difference, for it ain’t weak.

842
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,560
Try him onced.

843
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,080
Just as sound and strong as iron.

844
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,480
Never stumbles.

845
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,760
And he don’t never go to jumpin’ with yu’.

846
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,920
He’s kind and he’s smart.”

847
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,880
And the master petted his pony, who lifted a hoof for another
handshake.

848
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:04,000
Of course Balaam had never thought the leg was sprung, and he now took on an
unprejudiced air of wanting to believe Shorty’s statements if he only could.

849
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,640
“Maybe there’s two years’ work left in that leg,” he now observed.


850
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,560
“Better give your hawss away, Shorty,” said the Virginian.

851
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,720
“Is this your deal, my friend?” inquired Balaam.

852
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,880
And he slanted his bullet head at the Virginian.

853
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,280
“Give him away, Shorty,” drawled the Southerner.

854
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,360
“His laig is busted. Mr. Balaam says so.”

855
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,520
Balaam’s face grew evil with baffled fury.

856
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,600
But the Virginian was gravely considering Pedro.

857
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,800
He, too, was not pleased.

858
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,600
But he could not interfere.

859
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,400
Already he had overstepped the code in these matters.

860
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:42,520
He would have dearly liked⁠—for reasons good and bad, spite and
mercy mingled⁠—to

861
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:49,920
have spoiled Balaam’s market, to have offered a reasonable or even an
unreasonable price for Pedro, and taken possession of the horse himself.

862
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,800
But this might not be.

863
01:05:50,800 --> 01:06:02,600
In bets, in card games, in all horse transactions and other matters of similar business, a man
must take care of himself, and wiser onlookers must suppress their wisdom and hold their peace.

864
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,120
That evening Shorty again had a cigar.

865
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:11,520
He had parted with Pedro for forty dollars, a striped Mexican
blanket, and a pair of spurs.

866
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:20,280
Undressing over in the bunk house, he said to the Virginian, “I’ll
sure buy Pedro back off him just as soon as ever I rustle some cash.”

867
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,200
The Virginian grunted.

868
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:35,600
He was thinking he should have to travel hard to get the horses to the Judge by the 30th;
and below that thought lay his aching disappointment and his longing for Bear Creek.

869
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:49,200
In the early dawn Shorty sat up among his blankets on the floor of the bunk house and saw the various
sleepers coiled or sprawled in their beds; their breathing had not yet grown restless at the nearing of day.

870
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:56,200
He stepped to the door carefully, and saw the crowding blackbirds begin
their walk and chatter in the mud of the littered and trodden corrals.

871
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:13,120
From beyond among the cottonwoods, came continually the smooth unemphatic sound of the doves answering each other invisibly; and
against the empty ridge of the river-bluff lay the moon, no longer shining, for there was established a new light through the sky.

872
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,720
Pedro stood in the pasture close to the bars.

873
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:27,680
The cowboy slowly closed the door behind him, and sitting down on the step, drew
his money out and idly handled it, taking no comfort just then from its possession.

874
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:41,280
Then he put it back, and after dragging on his boots, crossed to the pasture, and held a last talk with his
pony, brushing the cakes of mud from his hide where he had rolled, and passing a lingering hand over his mane.

875
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:53,880
As the sounds of the morning came increasingly from tree and plain, Shorty glanced back to see that no
one was yet out of the cabin, and then put his arms round the horse’s neck, laying his head against him.

876
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:00,160
For a moment the cowboy’s insignificant face was exalted by the
emotion he would never have let others see.

877
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,160
He hugged tight this animal, who was dearer to his heart than
anybody in the world.

878
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,000
“Goodbye, Pedro,” he said⁠—“goodbye.”

879
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,640
Pedro looked for bread.

880
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,400
“No,” said his master, sorrowfully, “not any more.

881
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,920
Yu’ know well I’d give it yu’ if I had it.

882
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,160
You and me didn’t figure on this, did we, Pedro?

883
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,000
Goodbye!”

884
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,200
He hugged his pony again, and got as far as the bars of the pasture,
but returned once more.

885
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:38,480
“Goodbye, my little horse, my dear horse, my little, little Pedro,”
he said, as his tears wet the pony’s neck.

886
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,680
Then he wiped them with his hand, and got himself back to the
bunk house.

887
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:54,040
After breakfast he and his belongings departed to Drybone, and Pedro from his field calmly watched this
departure; for horses must recognize even less than men the black corners that their destinies turn.

888
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:59,440
The pony stopped feeding to look at the mail-wagon pass by; but
the master sitting in the wagon forebore

889
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,640
to turn

890
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,400
his head

891
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:01,400
.

892
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,520
CHAPTER XXVI

893
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,600
Balaam and Pedro

894
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:14,960
Resigned to wait for the Judge’s horses, Balaam went into his office this dry,
bright morning and read nine accumulated newspapers; for he was behindhand.

895
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,920
Then he rode out on the ditches, and met his man returning with
the troublesome animals at last.

896
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,920
He hastened home and sent for the Virginian.

897
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,120
He had made a decision.

898
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,600
“See here,” he said; “those horses are coming.

899
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,560
What trail would you take over to the Judge’s?”

900
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:37,320
“Shortest trail’s right through the Bow Laig Mountains,” said
the foreman, in his gentle voice.

901
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,200
“Guess you’re right.

902
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,240
It’s dinnertime.

903
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,840
We’ll start right afterward.

904
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:47,720
We’ll make Little Muddy Crossing by sundown, and Sunk Creek tomorrow,
and the next day’ll see us through.

905
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:51,120
Can a wagon get through Sunk Creek Canyon?”

906
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,800
The Virginian smiled.

907
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,120
“I reckon it can’t, seh, and stay resembling a wagon.”

908
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:08,320
Balaam told them to saddle Pedro and one packhorse, and drive the bunch of
horses into a corral, roping the Judge’s two, who proved extremely wild.

909
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:14,520
He had decided to take this journey himself on remembering certain
politics soon to be rife in Cheyenne.

910
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,320
For Judge Henry was indeed a greater man than Balaam.

911
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:36,600
This personally conducted return of the horses would temper its tardiness, and, moreover, the sight of some New York visitors would be a good thing
after seven months of no warmer touch with that metropolis than the Sunday Herald, always eight days old when it reached the Butte Creek Ranch.

912
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:46,040
They forded Butte Creek, and, crossing the well-travelled trail which follows down to Drybone, turned
their faces toward the uninhabited country that began immediately, as the ocean begins off a sandy shore.

913
01:10:46,040 --> 01:11:05,160
And as a single mast on which no sail is shining stands at the horizon and seems to add a loneliness to the surrounding sea, so the long gray line
of fence, almost a mile away, that ended Balaam’s land on this side the creek, stretched along the waste ground and added desolation to the plain.

914
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:19,400
No solitary watercourse with margin of cottonwoods or willow thickets flowed here to stripe the dingy, yellow world with
interrupting green, nor were cattle to be seen dotting the distance, nor moving objects at all, nor any bird in the soundless air.

915
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:28,480
The last gate was shut by the Virginian, who looked back at the pleasant trees of
the ranch, and then followed on in single file across the alkali of No Man’s Land.

916
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,120
No cloud was in the sky.

917
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,280
The desert’s grim noon shone sombrely on flat and hill.

918
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,520
The sagebrush was dull like zinc.

919
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:41,280
Thick heat rose near at hand from the caked alkali, and pale
heat shrouded the distant peaks.

920
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,520
There were five horses.

921
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:52,280
Balaam led on Pedro, his squat figure stiff in the saddle, but
solid as a rock, and tilted a little forward, as his habit was.

922
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,160
One of the Judge’s horses came next, a sorrel, dragging back
continually on the rope by which he was led.

923
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:03,680
After him ambled Balaam’s wise pack-animal, carrying the light
burden of two days’ food and lodging.

924
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:13,800
She was an old mare who could still go when she chose, but had been schooled by the
years, and kept the trail, giving no trouble to the Virginian who came behind her.

925
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:21,960
He also sat solid as a rock, yet subtly bending to the struggles of the wild
horse he led, as a steel spring bends and balances and resumes its poise.

926
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:47,440
Thus they made but slow time, and when they topped the last dull rise of ground and looked down on the long slant of ragged, caked earth to the crossing of Little Muddy, with its single tree and
few mean bushes, the final distance where eyesight ends had deepened to violet from the thin, steady blue they had stared at for so many hours, and all heat was gone from the universal dryness.

927
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:53,960
The horses drank a long time from the sluggish yellow water, and
its alkaline taste and warmth were equally welcome to the men.

928
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:04,320
They built a little fire, and when supper was ended, smoked but a short while and in silence,
before they got in the blankets that were spread in a smooth place beside the water.

929
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:14,040
They had picketed the two horses of the Judge in the best grass they
could find, letting the rest go free to find pasture where they could.

930
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:20,760
When the first light came, the Virginian attended to breakfast,
while Balaam rode away on the sorrel to bring in the loose horses.

931
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,720
They had gone far out of sight, and when he returned with them,
after some two hours, he was on Pedro.

932
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:31,200
Pedro was soaking with sweat, and red froth creamed from his
mouth.

933
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:37,440
The Virginian saw the horses must have been hard to drive in,
especially after Balaam brought them the wild sorrel as a leader.

934
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:44,840
“If you’d kep’ ridin’ him, ’stead of changin’ off on your hawss,
they’d have behaved quieter,” said the foreman.

935
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,960
“That’s good seasonable advice,” said Balaam, sarcastically.

936
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,720
“I could have told you that now.”

937
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,200
“I could have told you when you started,” said the Virginian,
heating the coffee for Balaam.

938
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,520
Balaam was eloquent on the outrageous conduct of the horses.

939
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:03,160
He had come up with them evidently striking back for Butte Creek,
with the old mare in the lead.

940
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:08,480
“But I soon showed her the road she was to go,” he said, as he
drove them now to the water.

941
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:18,760
The Virginian noticed the slight limp of the mare, and how her
pastern was cut as if with a stone or the sharp heel of a boot.

942
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,760
“I guess she’ll not be in a hurry to travel except when she’s
wanted to,” continued Balaam.

943
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,680
He sat down, and sullenly poured himself some coffee.

944
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,400
“We’ll be in luck if we make any Sunk Creek this night.”

945
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:40,800
He went on with his breakfast, thinking aloud for the benefit of his companion, who made no comments,
preferring silence to the discomfort of talking with a man whose vindictive humor was so thoroughly uppermost.

946
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:50,120
He did not even listen very attentively, but continued his preparations for departure, washing the
dishes, rolling the blankets, and moving about in his usual way of easy and visible good nature.

947
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,800
“Six o’clock, already,” said Balaam, saddling the horses.

948
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,440
“And we’ll not get started for ten minutes more.”

949
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,600
Then he came to Pedro.

950
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,520
“So you haven’t quit fooling yet, haven’t you?” he exclaimed,
for the pony shrank as he lifted the bridle.

951
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:15,440
“Take that for your sore mouth!” and he rammed the bit in, at
which Pedro flung back and reared.

952
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,960
“Well, I never saw Pedro act that way yet,” said the Virginian.


953
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,280
“Ah, rubbish!” said Balaam.

954
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,040
“They’re all the same.

955
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,880
Not a bastard one but’s laying for his chance to do for you.

956
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,920
Some’ll buck you off, and some’ll roll with you, and some’ll
fight you with their fore feet.

957
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:44,080
They may play good for a year, but the Western pony’s man’s enemy,
and when he judges he’s got his chance, he’s going to do his best.

958
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,800
And if you come out alive it won’t be his fault.”

959
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,000
Balaam paused for a while, packing.

960
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,320
“You’ve got to keep them afraid of you,” he said next; “that’s
what you’ve got to do if you don’t want trouble.

961
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:06,120
That Pedro horse there has been fed, hand-fed, and fooled with
like a damn pet, and what’s that policy done?

962
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:13,480
Why, he goes ugly when he thinks it’s time, and decides he’ll
not drive any horses into camp this morning.

963
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,480
He knows better now.”

964
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:19,400
“Mr. Balaam,” said the Virginian, “I’ll buy that hawss off yu’
right now.”

965
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,400
Balaam shook his head.

966
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,280
“You’ll not do that right now or any other time,” said he.

967
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,520
“I happen to want him.”

968
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,520
The Virginian could do no more.

969
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:32,680
He had heard cowpunchers say to refractory ponies, “You keep still, or
I’ll Balaam you!” and he now understood the aptness of the expression.

970
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:38,080
Meanwhile Balaam began to lead Pedro to the creek for a last
drink before starting across the torrid drought.

971
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:43,200
The horse held back on the rein a little, and Balaam turned and
cut the whip across his forehead.

972
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:50,200
A delay of forcing and backing followed, while the Virginian,
already in the saddle, waited.

973
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:55,040
The minutes passed, and no immediate prospect, apparently, of
getting nearer Sunk Creek.

974
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,000
“He ain’ goin’ to follow you while you’re beatin’ his haid,”
the Southerner at length remarked.

975
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,440
“Do you think you can teach me anything about horses?” retorted
Balaam.

976
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,800
“Well, it don’t look like I could,” said the Virginian, lazily.


977
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,440
“Then don’t try it, so long as it’s not your horse, my friend.”


978
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,160
Again the Southerner levelled his eye on Balaam.

979
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,280
“All right,” he said, in the same gentle voice.

980
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,680
“And don’t you call me your friend. You’ve made that mistake
twiced.”

981
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:33,920
The road was shadeless, as it had been from the start, and they
could not travel fast.

982
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:43,400
During the first few hours all coolness was driven out of the glassy morning,
and another day of illimitable sun invested the world with its blaze.

983
01:17:43,400 --> 01:18:04,720
The pale Bow Leg Range was coming nearer, but its hard hot slants and rifts suggested no sort of freshness, and even the pines that spread
for wide miles along near the summit counted for nothing in the distance and the glare, but seemed mere patches of dull dry discoloration.

984
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:17,680
No talk was exchanged between the two travellers, for the cowpuncher had nothing to say and Balaam was
sulky, so they moved along in silent endurance of each other’s company and the tedium of the journey.

985
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:23,160
But the slow succession of rise and fall in the plain changed
and shortened.

986
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:32,760
The earth’s surface became lumpy, rising into mounds and knotted systems of steep small hills
cut apart by staring gashes of sand, where water poured in the spring from the melting snow.

987
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:49,040
After a time they ascended through the foothills till the plain below was for a while concealed, but came again into view in its
entirety, distant and a thing of the past, while some magpies sailed down to meet them from the new country they were entering.

988
01:18:49,040 --> 01:19:06,120
They passed up through a small transparent forest of dead trees standing stark and white, and a little higher
came on a line of narrow moisture that crossed the way and formed a stale pool among some willow thickets.

989
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:20,720
They turned aside to water their horses, and found near the pool a circular spot of ashes and
some poles lying, and beside these a cage-like edifice of willow wands built in the ground.

990
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,640
“Indian camp,” observed the Virginian.

991
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:30,840
There were the tracks of five or six horses on the farther side of the pool, and they
did not come into the trail, but led off among the rocks on some system of their own.

992
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,480
“They’re about a week old,” said Balaam.

993
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:37,080
“It’s part of that outfit that’s been hunting.”

994
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:42,520
“They’ve gone on to visit their friends,” added the cowpuncher.


995
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,480
“Yes, on the Southern Reservation. How far do you call Sunk Creek
now?”

996
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:55,880
“Well,” said the Virginian, calculating, “it’s mighty nigh fo’ty
miles from Muddy Crossin’, an’ I reckon we’ve come eighteen.”

997
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,920
“Just about. It’s noon.”

998
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,120
Balaam snapped his watch shut.

999
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,480
“We’ll rest here till 12:30.”

1000
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:07,440
When it was time to go, the Virginian looked musingly at the
mountains.

1001
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,240
“We’ll need to travel right smart to get through the canyon tonight,”
he said.

1002
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:20,400
“Tell you what,” said Balaam; “we’ll rope the Judge’s horses
together and drive ’em in front of us.

1003
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,880
That’ll make speed.”

1004
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,080
“Mightn’t they get away on us?” objected the Virginian.

1005
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,960
“They’re pow’ful wild.”

1006
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:33,840
“They can’t get away from me, I guess,” said Balaam, and the
arrangement was adopted.

1007
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,560
“We’re the first this season over this piece of the trail,” he
observed presently.

1008
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,560
His companion had noticed the ground already, and assented.

1009
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:50,160
There were no tracks anywhere to be seen over which winter had
not come and gone since they had been made.

1010
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:55,960
Presently the trail wound into a sultry gulch that hemmed in
the heat and seemed to draw down the sun’s rays more vertically.

1011
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,280
The sorrel horse chose this place to make a try for liberty.

1012
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,840
He suddenly whirled from the trail, dragging with him his less
inventive fellow.

1013
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:16,280
Leaving the Virginian with the old mare, Balaam headed them off, for Pedro was quick, and they came jumping down
the bank together, but swiftly crossed up on the other side, getting much higher before they could be reached.

1014
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:31,120
It was no place for this sort of game, as the sides of the ravine were ploughed with steep channels, broken with jutting
knobs of rock, and impeded by short twisted pines that swung out from their roots horizontally over the pitch of the hill.

1015
01:21:31,120 --> 01:22:01,000
The Virginian helped, but used his horse with more judgment, keeping as much on the level as possible, and endeavoring to anticipate the next turn of the runaways before they made it, while Balaam attempted to follow them close, wheeling
short when they doubled, heavily beating up the face of the slope, veering again to come down to the point he had left, and whenever he felt Pedro begin to flag, driving his spurs into the horse and forcing him to keep up the pace.

1016
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:18,680
He had set out to overtake and capture on the side of the mountain these two animals who had been running wild for many weeks,
and now carried no weight but themselves, and the futility of such work could not penetrate his obstinate and rising temper.

1017
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,480
He had made up his mind not to give in.

1018
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:32,520
The Virginian soon decided to move slowly along for the present, preventing the wild horses
from passing down the gulch again, but otherwise saving his own animal from useless fatigue.

1019
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,720
He saw that Pedro was reeking wet, with mouth open, and constantly
stumbling, though he galloped on.

1020
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:56,320
The cowpuncher kept the group in sight, driving the packhorse in front of him, and watching the tactics of the sorrel, who had now undoubtedly
become the leader of the expedition, and was at the top of the gulch, in vain trying to find an outlet through its rocky rim to the levels above.

1021
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:09,080
He soon judged this to be no thoroughfare, and changing his plan, trotted down to the bottom
and up the other side, gaining more and more; for in this new descent Pedro had fallen twice.

1022
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,920
Then the sorrel showed the cleverness of a genuinely vicious
horse.

1023
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:20,760
The Virginian saw him stop and fall to kicking his companion
with all the energy that a short rope would permit.

1024
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:28,080
The rope slipped, and both, unencumbered, reached the top and
disappeared.

1025
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:36,440
Leaving the packhorse for Balaam, the Virginian started after them and
came into a high tableland, beyond which the mountains began in earnest.

1026
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,480
The runaways were moving across toward these at an easy rate.


1027
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:46,080
He followed for a moment, then looking back, and seeing no sign of Balaam, waited,
for the horses were sure not to go fast when they reached good pasture or water.

1028
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:52,880
He got out of the saddle and sat on the ground, watching, till
the mare came up slowly into sight, and Balaam behind her.

1029
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:59,880
When they were near, Balaam dismounted and struck Pedro fearfully,
until the stick broke, and he raised the splintered half to continue.

1030
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:05,480
Seeing the pony’s condition, the Virginian spoke, and said, “I’d
let that hawss alone.”

1031
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:12,880
Balaam turned to him, but wholly possessed by passion did not seem to hear,
and the Southerner noticed how white and like that of a maniac his face was.

1032
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,320
The stick slid to the ground.

1033
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,840
“He played he was tired,” said Balaam, looking at the Virginian
with glazed eyes.

1034
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,160
The violence of his rage affected him physically, like some stroke
of illness.

1035
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,600
“He played out on me on purpose.”

1036
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,320
The man’s voice was dry and light.

1037
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:35,200
“He’s perfectly fresh now,” he continued, and turned again to
the coughing, swaying horse, whose eyes were closed.

1038
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,640
Not having the stick, he seized the animal’s unresisting head
and shook it.

1039
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:44,160
The Virginian watched him a moment, and rose to stop such a spectacle.


1040
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:55,920
Then, as if conscious he was doing no real hurt, Balaam ceased, and turning again
in slow fashion looked across the level, where the runaways were still visible.

1041
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,000
“I’ll have to take your horse,” he said, “mine’s played out on
me.”

1042
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,160
“You ain’ goin’ to touch my hawss.”

1043
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:11,600
Again the words seemed not entirely to reach Balaam’s understanding,
so dulled by rage were his senses.

1044
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:21,200
He made no answer, but mounted Pedro; and the failing pony walked
mechanically forward, while the Virginian, puzzled, stood looking after him.

1045
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,160
Balaam seemed without purpose of going anywhere, and stopped
in a moment.

1046
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,920
Suddenly he was at work at something.

1047
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,960
This sight was odd and new to look at.

1048
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,880
For a few seconds it had no meaning to the Virginian as he watched.


1049
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,960
Then his mind grasped the horror, too late.

1050
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:41,040
Even with his cry of execration and the tiger spring that he
gave to stop Balaam, the monstrosity was wrought.

1051
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,920
Pedro sank motionless, his head rolling flat on the earth.

1052
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,520
Balaam was jammed beneath him.

1053
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:54,520
The man had struggled to his feet before the Virginian reached the
spot, and the horse then lifted his head and turned it piteously round.

1054
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,520
Then vengeance like a blast struck Balaam.

1055
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:02,440
The Virginian hurled him to the ground, lifted and hurled him
again, lifted him and beat his face and struck his jaw.

1056
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,360
The man’s strong ox-like fighting availed nothing.

1057
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,920
He fended his eyes as best he could against these sledgehammer
blows of justice.

1058
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,720
He felt blindly for his pistol.

1059
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:18,040
That arm was caught and wrenched backward, and crushed and doubled.


1060
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,280
He seemed to hear his own bones, and set up a hideous screaming
of hate and pain.

1061
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:28,320
Then the pistol at last came out, and together with the hand
that grasped it was instantly stamped into the dust.

1062
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:34,920
Once again the creature was lifted and slung so that he lay across
Pedro’s saddle a blurred, dingy, wet pulp.

1063
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,120
Vengeance had come and gone.

1064
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,680
The man and the horse were motionless.

1065
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:44,120
Around them, silence seemed to gather like a witness.

1066
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,320
“If you are dead,” said the Virginian, “I am glad of it.”

1067
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:52,440
He stood looking down at Balaam and Pedro, prone in the middle
of the open tableland.

1068
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,760
Then he saw Balaam looking at him.

1069
01:26:53,760 --> 01:27:01,680
It was the quiet stare of sight without thought or feeling, the mere
visual sense alone, almost frightful in its separation from any self.

1070
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,520
But as he watched those eyes, the self came back into them.

1071
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,080
“I have not killed you,” said the Virginian.

1072
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,240
“Well, I ain’t goin’ to do any more to yu’⁠—if that’s a satisfaction
to know.”

1073
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:20,200
Then he began to attend to Balaam with impersonal skill, like
someone hired for the purpose.

1074
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:36,120
“He ain’t hurt bad,” he asserted aloud, as if the man were some nameless patient; and then to Balaam
he remarked, “I reckon it might have put a less tough man than you out of business for quite a while.

1075
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:39,200
I’m goin’ to get some water now.”

1076
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:44,120
When he returned with the water, Balaam was sitting up, looking
about him.

1077
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:49,080
He had not yet spoken, nor did he now speak.

1078
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:55,800
The sunlight flashed on the six-shooter where it lay, and the
Virginian secured it.

1079
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:01,800
“She ain’t so pretty as she was,” he remarked, as he examined
the weapon.

1080
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,000
“But she’ll go right handy yet.”

1081
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,920
Strength was in a measure returning to Pedro.

1082
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:15,760
He was a young horse, and the exhaustion neither of anguish
nor of overriding was enough to affect him long or seriously.

1083
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:22,000
He got himself on his feet and walked waveringly over to the
old mare, and stood by her for comfort.

1084
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:34,360
The cowpuncher came up to him, and Pedro, after starting back
slightly, seemed to comprehend that he was in friendly hands.

1085
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:44,080
It was plain that he would soon be able to travel slowly if no
weight was on him, and that he would be a very good horse again.

1086
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:52,440
Whether they abandoned the runaways or not, there was no staying
here for night to overtake them without food or water.

1087
01:28:52,440 --> 01:29:15,800
The day was still high, and what its next few hours had in store the Virginian could not say, and he left them to take care of themselves,
determining meanwhile that he would take command of the minutes and maintain the position he had assumed both as to Balaam and Pedro.

1088
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:28,040
He took Pedro’s saddle off, threw the mare’s pack to the ground, put Balaam’s saddle on her,
and on that stowed or tied her original pack, which he could do, since it was so light.

1089
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,680
Then he went to Balaam, who was sitting up.

1090
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,520
“I reckon you can travel,” said the Virginian.

1091
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,120
“And your hawss can.

1092
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,400
If you’re comin’ with me, you’ll ride your mare.

1093
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,760
I’m goin’ to trail them hawsses

1094
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:44,800
.

1095
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:50,920
If you’re not comin’ with me, your hawss comes with me, and you’ll
take fifty dollars for him.”

1096
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,160
Balaam was indifferent to this good bargain.

1097
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:57,480
He did not look at the other or speak, but rose and searched
about him on the ground.

1098
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:03,160
The Virginian was also indifferent as to whether Balaam chose
to answer or not.

1099
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,640
Seeing Balaam searching the ground, he finished what he had to
say.

1100
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:12,720
“I have your six-shooter, and you’ll have it when I’m ready for
you to. Now, I’m goin’,” he concluded.

1101
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:21,160
Balaam’s intellect was clear enough now, and he saw that though the
rest of this journey would be nearly intolerable, it must go on.

1102
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:35,640
He looked at the impassive cowpuncher getting ready to go and tying a rope on Pedro’s neck to lead him, then he looked at
the mountains where the runaways had vanished, and it did not seem credible to him that he had come into such straits.

1103
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:42,560
He was helped stiffly on the mare, and the three horses in single file
took up their journey once more, and came slowly among the mountains.

1104
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:47,840
The perpetual desert was ended, and they crossed a small brook,
where they missed the trail.

1105
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:54,440
The Virginian dismounted to find where the horses had turned off, and
discovered that they had gone straight up the ridge by the watercourse.

1106
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:59,240
“There’s been a man camped in hyeh inside a month,” he said,
kicking up a rag of red flannel.

1107
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:03,120
“White man and two hawsses. Ours have went up his old tracks.”


1108
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,800
It was not easy for Balaam to speak yet, and he kept his silence.


1109
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,400
But he remembered that Shorty had spoken of a trapper who had
started for Sunk Creek.

1110
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:21,360
For three hours they followed the runaways’ course over softer ground, and steadily ascending,
passed one or two springs, at length, where the mud was not yet settled in the hoofprints.

1111
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:26,160
Then they came through a corner of pine forest and down a sudden
bank among quaking-asps to a green park.

1112
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:34,760
Here the runaways beside a stream were grazing at ease, but saw
them coming, and started on again, following down the stream.

1113
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,480
For the present all to be done was to keep them in sight.

1114
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:43,680
This creek received tributaries and widened, making a valley
for itself.

1115
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:57,400
Above the bottom, lining the first terrace of the ridge, began the pines, and stretched back,
unbroken over intervening summit and basin, to cease at last where the higher peaks presided.

1116
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:02,320
“This hyeh’s the middle fork of Sunk Creek,” said the Virginian.


1117
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,640
“We’ll get on to our right road again where they join.”

1118
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,840
Soon a game trail marked itself along the stream.

1119
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,920
If this would only continue, the runaways would be nearly sure
to follow it down into the canyon.

1120
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:21,040
Then there would be no way for them but to go on and come out into their own
country, where they would make for the Judge’s ranch of their own accord.

1121
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,960
The great point was to reach the canyon before dark.

1122
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,920
They passed into permanent shadow; for though the other side of the creek shone
in full day, the sun had departed behind the ridges immediately above them.

1123
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,240
Coolness filled the air, and the silence, which in this deep valley
of invading shadow seemed too silent, was relieved by the birds.

1124
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:48,160
Not birds of song, but a freakish band of gray talkative observers, who came calling and croaking along through
the pines, and inspected the cavalcade, keeping it company for a while, and then flying up into the woods again.

1125
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:58,240
The travellers came round a corner on a little spread of marsh, and from somewhere in the middle of it rose a
buzzard and sailed on its black pinions into the air above them, wheeling and wheeling, but did not grow distant.

1126
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:06,640
As it swept over the trail, something fell from its claw, a rag of
red flannel; and each man in turn looked at it as his horse went by.

1127
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,920
“I wonder if there’s plenty elk and deer hyeh?” said the Virginian.


1128
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,160
“I guess there is,” Balaam replied, speaking at last.

1129
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,520
The travellers had become strangely reconciled.

1130
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:23,040
“There’s game ’most all over these mountains,” the Virginian
continued; “country not been settled long enough to scare them out.”

1131
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:28,600
So they fell into casual conversation, and for the first time
were glad of each other’s company.

1132
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:34,000
The sound of a new bird came from the pines above⁠—the hoot
of an owl⁠—and was answered from some other part of the wood.

1133
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,600
This they did not particularly notice at first, but soon they
heard the same note, unexpectedly distant, like an echo.

1134
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:48,440
The game trail, now quite a defined path beside the river, showed no sign of changing
its course or fading out into blank ground, as these uncertain guides do so often.

1135
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:55,080
It led consistently in the desired direction, and the two men
were relieved to see it continue.

1136
01:33:55,080 --> 01:34:02,160
Not only were the runaways easier to keep track of, but better
speed was made along this valley.

1137
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:13,840
The pervading imminence of night more and more dispelled the lingering afternoon, though there
was yet no twilight in the open, and the high peaks opposite shone yellow in the invisible sun.

1138
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,440
But now the owls hooted again.

1139
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:23,040
Their music had something in it that caused both the Virginian and
Balaam to look up at the pines and wish that this valley would end.

1140
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:41,640
Perhaps it was early for night-birds to begin; or perhaps it was that the sound never seemed to fall behind, but moved abreast
of them among the trees above, as they rode on without pause down below; some influence made the faces of the travellers grave.

1141
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:54,640
The spell of evil which the sight of the wheeling buzzard had begun, deepened as evening grew, while ever and again
along the creek the singular call and answer of the owls wandered among the darkness of the trees not far away.

1142
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:59,600
The sun was gone from the peaks when at length the other side
of the stream opened into a long wide meadow.

1143
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:09,440
The trail they followed, after crossing a flat willow thicket by the water, ran into
dense pines, that here for the first time reached all the way down to the water’s edge.

1144
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:17,800
The two men came out of the willows, and saw ahead the capricious
runaways leave the bottom and go up the hill and enter the wood.

1145
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:23,560
“We must hinder that,” said the Virginian; and he dropped Pedro’s
rope.

1146
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:34,840
“There’s your six-shooter. You keep the trail, and camp down there” ⁠—he
pointed to where the trees came to the water⁠—“till I head them hawsses off.

1147
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,240
I may not get back right away.”

1148
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:43,840
He galloped up the open hill and went into the pine, choosing
a place above where the vagrants had disappeared.

1149
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:54,160
Balaam dismounted, and picking up his six-shooter, took the rope off
Pedro’s neck and drove him slowly down toward where the wood began.

1150
01:35:54,160 --> 01:36:10,720
Its interior was already dim, and Balaam saw that here must be their stopping-place tonight, since there was no telling how
wide this pine strip might extend along the trail before they could come out of it and reach another suitable camping-ground.

1151
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:14,960
Pedro had recovered his strength, and he now showed signs of
restlessness.

1152
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:22,000
He shied where there was not even a stone in the trail, and finally
turned sharply round.

1153
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,840
Balaam expected he was going to rush back on the way they had
come; but the horse stood still, breathing excitedly.

1154
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,040
He was urged forward again, though he turned more than once.

1155
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:37,040
But when they were a few paces from the wood, and Balaam had got off preparatory
to camping, the horse snorted and dashed into the water, and stood still there.

1156
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:46,800
The astonished Balaam followed to turn him; but Pedro seemed to lose control of
himself, and plunged to the middle of the river, and was evidently intending to cross.

1157
01:36:46,800 --> 01:37:03,400
Fearing that he would escape to the opposite meadow and add to their difficulties, Balaam, with the idea of turning him round, drew his
six-shooter and fired in front of the horse, divining, even as the flash cut the dusk, the secret of all this⁠—the Indians; but too late.

1158
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:18,640
His bruised hand had stiffened, marring his aim, and he saw Pedro fall over in the water then rise and struggle
up the bank on the farther shore, where he now hurried also, to find that he had broken the pony’s leg.

1159
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:32,040
He needed no interpreter for the voices of the seeming owls that had haunted the latter hour of their journey, and
he knew that his beast’s keener instinct had perceived the destruction that lurked in the interior of the wood.

1160
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:47,120
The history of the trapper whose horse had returned without him might have been⁠—might still be⁠—his own; and he
thought of the rag that had fallen from the buzzard’s talons when he had been disturbed at his meal in the marsh.

1161
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:58,600
“Peaceable” Indians were still in these mountains, and some few of them had for the past hour been
skirting his journey unseen, and now waited for him in the wood which they expected him to enter.

1162
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:12,840
They had been too wary to use their rifles or show themselves, lest these travellers should be only part
of a larger company following, who would hear the noise of a shot, and catch them in the act of murder.

1163
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:20,360
So, safe under the cover of the pines, they had planned to sling their silent
noose, and drag the white man from his horse as he passed through the trees.

1164
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:34,320
Balaam looked over the river at the ominous wood, and then he looked at Pedro, the
horse that he had first maimed and now ruined, to whom he probably owed his life.

1165
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:42,320
He was lying on the ground, quietly looking over the green meadow,
where dusk was gathering.

1166
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:52,920
Perhaps he was not suffering from his wound yet, as he rested on the ground; and into his
animal intelligence there probably came no knowledge of this final stroke of his fate.

1167
01:38:52,920 --> 01:39:01,000
At any rate, no sound of pain came from Pedro, whose friendly
and gentle face remained turned toward the meadow.

1168
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,480
Once more Balaam fired his pistol, and this time the aim was
true, and the horse rolled over, with a ball through his brain.

1169
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:10,800
It was the best reward that remained for him.

1170
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,280
Then Balaam rejoined the old mare, and turned from the middle
fork of Sunk Creek.

1171
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:28,000
He dashed across the wide field, and went over a ridge, and found his way along in the night till
he came to the old trail⁠—the road which they would never have left but for him and his obstinacy.

1172
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:39,120
He unsaddled the weary mare by Sunk Creek, where the canyon begins, letting her drag a rope and find pasture
and water, while he, lighting no fire to betray him, crouched close under a tree till the light came.

1173
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,520
He thought of the Virginian in the wood.

1174
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,320
But what could either have done for the other had he stayed to
look for him among the pines?

1175
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:48,680
If the cowpuncher came back to the corner, he would follow Balaam’s
tracks or not.

1176
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,960
They would meet, at any rate, where the creeks joined.

1177
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:50,520
But they did not meet.

1178
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:58,720
And then to Balaam the prospect of going onward to the Sunk Creek
Ranch became more than he could bear.

1179
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:13,000
To come without the horses, to meet Judge Henry, to meet the guests of the Judge’s, looking as he did now after his
punishment by the Virginian, to give the news about the Judge’s favorite man⁠—no, how could he tell such a story as this?

1180
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,360
Balaam went no farther than a certain cabin, where he slept,
and wrote a letter to the Judge.

1181
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,720
This the owner of the cabin delivered.

1182
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:38,480
And so, having spread news which would at once cause a search for the Virginian, and having constructed such sentences to the Judge as would
most smoothly explain how, being overtaken by illness, he had not wished to be a burden at Sunk Creek, Balaam turned homeward by himself.

1183
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:45,920
By the time he was once more at Butte Creek, his general appearance
was a thing less to be noticed.

1184
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,240
And there was Shorty, waiting!

1185
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,920
One way and another, the lost dog had been able to gather some
ready money.

1186
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:54,280
He was cheerful because of this momentary purseful of prosperity.


1187
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,600
“And so I come back, yu’ see,” he said.

1188
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:01,440
“For I figured on getting Pedro back as soon as I could when
I sold him to yu’.”

1189
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,560
“You’re behind the times, Shorty,” said Balaam.

1190
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,080
Shorty looked blank.

1191
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,400
“You’ve sure not sold Pedro?” he exclaimed.

1192
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,840
“Them Indians,” said Balaam, “got after me on the Bow Leg trail.


1193
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,480
Got after me and that Virginia man.

1194
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:16,080
But they didn’t get me.”

1195
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:23,320
Balaam wagged his bullet head to imply that this escape was due
to his own superior intelligence.

1196
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,440
The Virginian had been stupid, and so the Indians had got him.


1197
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:29,960
“And they shot your horse,” Balaam finished.

1198
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,200
“Stop and get some dinner with the boys.”

1199
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,120
Having eaten, Shorty rode away in mournful spirits.

1200
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:42,600
For he had made so sure of once more riding and talking with
Pedro, his friend whom he had taught to shake hands.

1201
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,760
CHAPTER XXVII

1202
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,480
Grandmother Stark

1203
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:50,360
Except for its chair and bed, the cabin was stripped almost bare.


1204
01:41:50,360 --> 01:42:00,320
Amid its emptiness of dismantled shelves and walls and floor, only the tiny
ancestress still hung in her place, last token of the home that had been.

1205
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:13,480
This miniature, tacked against the despoiled boards, and its descendant, the angry girl with her hand on an open
box-lid, made a sort of couple in the loneliness: she on the wall sweet and serene, she by the box sweet and stormy.

1206
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:18,040
The picture was her final treasure waiting to be packed for the
journey.

1207
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:33,320
In whatever room she had called her own since childhood, there it had also lived and looked at her,
not quite familiar, not quite smiling, but in its prim colonial hues delicate as some pressed flower.

1208
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:46,840
Its pale oval, of color blue and rose and flaxen, in a battered, pretty gold frame,
unconquerably pervaded any surroundings with a something like last year’s lavender.

1209
01:42:46,840 --> 01:43:03,640
Till yesterday a Crow Indian war-bonnet had hung next it, a sumptuous cascade of feathers; on the other side a bow with arrows had dangled;
opposite had been the skin of a silver fox; over the door had spread the antlers of a blacktail deer; a bearskin stretched beneath it.

1210
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:13,440
Thus had the whole cozy log cabin been upholstered, lavish with trophies of the
frontier; and yet it was in front of the miniature that the visitors used to stop.

1211
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:18,440
Shining quietly now in the cabin’s blackness this summer day,
the heirloom was presiding until the end.

1212
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:27,200
And as Molly Wood’s eyes fell upon her ancestress of Bennington, 1777, there flashed
a spark of steel in them, alone here in the room that she was leaving forever.

1213
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:35,440
She was not going to teach school any more on Bear Creek, Wyoming;
she was going home to Bennington, Vermont.

1214
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,720
When time came for school to open again, there should be a new
schoolmarm.

1215
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,960
This was the momentous result of that visit which the Virginian
had paid her.

1216
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,560
He had told her that he was coming for his hour soon.

1217
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,440
From that hour she had decided to escape.

1218
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,080
She was running away from her own heart.

1219
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:58,520
She did not dare to trust herself face to face again with her
potent, indomitable lover.

1220
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,840
She longed for him, and therefore she would never see him again.


1221
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:09,560
No great-aunt at Dunbarton, or anybody else that knew her and her family, should
ever say that she had married below her station, had been an unworthy Stark!

1222
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:14,000
Accordingly, she had written to the Virginian, bidding him goodbye,
and wishing him everything in the world.

1223
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,520
As she happened to be aware that she was taking everything in the world
away from him, this letter was not the most easy of letters to write.

1224
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,360
But she had made the language very kind.

1225
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,440
Yes; it was a thoroughly kind communication.

1226
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:33,000
And all because of that momentary visit, when he had brought
back to her two novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice.

1227
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:39,520
“How do you like them?” she had then inquired; and he had smiled
slowly at her.

1228
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,640
“You haven’t read them!” she exclaimed.

1229
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:41,680
“No.”

1230
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,880
“Are you going to tell me there has been no time?”

1231
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:44,880
“No.”

1232
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:51,120
Then Molly had scolded her cowpuncher, and to this he had listened with
pleasure undisguised, as indeed he listened to every word that she said.

1233
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:57,200
“Why, it has come too late,” he had told her when the scolding
was over.

1234
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:03,040
“If I was one of your little scholars hyeh in Bear Creek schoolhouse,
yu’ could learn me to like such frillery I reckon.

1235
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:06,840
But I’m a mighty ignorant, growed-up man.”

1236
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,640
“So much the worse for you !” said Molly.

1237
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:14,680
“No. I am pretty glad I am a man. Else I could not have learned
the thing you have taught me.”

1238
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:17,720
But she shut her lips and looked away.

1239
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:20,080
On the desk was a letter written from Vermont.

1240
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:24,800
“If you don’t tell me at once when you decide,” had said the
arch writer, “never hope to speak to me again.

1241
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,320
Mary Wood, seriously, I am suspicious.

1242
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,440
Why do you never mention him nowadays?

1243
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,320
How exciting to have you bring a live cowboy to Bennington!

1244
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,360
We should all come to dinner.

1245
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,480
Though of course I understand now that many of them have excellent
manners.

1246
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:43,800
But would he wear his pistol at table?”

1247
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,000
So the letter ran on.

1248
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,520
It recounted the latest home gossip and jokes.

1249
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:54,840
In answering it Molly Wood had taken no notice of its childish
tone here and there.

1250
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:00,360
“Hyeh’s some of them cactus blossoms yu’ wanted,” said the Virginian.


1251
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,280
His voice recalled the girl with almost a start.

1252
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:08,880
“I’ve brought a good hawss I’ve gentled for yu’, and Taylor’ll
keep him till I need him.”

1253
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,800
“Thank you so much! but I wish⁠—”

1254
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,600
“I reckon yu’ can’t stop me lendin’ Taylor a hawss.

1255
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:18,240
And you cert’nly’ll get sick schoolteachin’ if yu’ don’t keep
outdoors some.

1256
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,000
Goodbye⁠—till that next time

1257
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:20,600
.”

1258
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:25,200
“Yes; there’s always a next time,” she answered, as lightly as
she could.

1259
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:28,800
“There always will be. Don’t yu’ know that?”

1260
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,600
She did not reply.

1261
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,920
“I have discouraged spells,” he pursued, “but I down them.

1262
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,880
For I’ve told yu’ you were going to love me.

1263
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,120
You are goin’ to learn back the thing you have taught me.

1264
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:40,160
I’m not askin’ anything now; I don’t want you to speak a word
to me.

1265
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,400
But I’m never goin’ to quit till ‘next time’ is no more

1266
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:42,800
,

1267
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:42,880
and

1268
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,480
it’s ‘all the time’ for you and me.”

1269
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,640
With that he had ridden away, not even touching her hand.

1270
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:54,760
Long after he had gone she was still in her chair, her eyes
lingering upon his flowers, those yellow cups of the prickly pear.

1271
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:01,960
At length she had risen impatiently, caught up the flowers, gone with them
to the open window⁠—and then, after all, set them with pains in water.

1272
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:05,160
But today Bear Creek was over.

1273
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,840
She was going home now.

1274
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,160
By the week’s end she would be started.

1275
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,760
By the time the mail brought him her goodbye letter she would
be gone.

1276
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,680
She had acted.

1277
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:24,520
To Bear Creek, the neighborly, the friendly, the not comprehending,
this move had come unlooked for, and had brought regret.

1278
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:31,440
Only one hard word had been spoken to Molly, and that by her
next-door neighbor and kindest friend.

1279
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:39,720
In Mrs. Taylor’s house the girl had daily come and gone as a
daughter, and that lady reached the subject thus:⁠—

1280
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:48,640
“When I took Taylor,” said she, sitting by as Robert Browning
and Jane Austen were going into their box, “I married for love.”

1281
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:53,360
“Do you wish it had been money?” said Molly, stooping to her
industries.

1282
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,640
“You know both of us better than that, child.”

1283
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:04,320
“I know I’ve seen people at home who couldn’t possibly have had
any other reason. They seemed satisfied, too.”

1284
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,680
“Maybe the poor ignorant things were!”

1285
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,240
“And so I have never been sure how I might choose.”

1286
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,440
“Yes, you are sure, deary.

1287
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,560
Don’t you think I know you?

1288
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:28,960
And when it comes over Taylor once in a while, and he tells me I’m the best thing in his life, and I tell him he ain’t merely the best
thing but the only thing in mine⁠—him and the children⁠—why, we just agree we’d do it all over the same way if we had the chance.”

1289
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,960
Molly continued to be industrious.

1290
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:39,160
“And that’s why,” said Mrs. Taylor, “I want every girl that’s
anything to me to know her luck when it comes.

1291
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:43,800
For I was that near telling Taylor I wouldn’t!”

1292
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:49,960
“If ever my luck comes,” said Molly, with her back to her friend,
“I shall say ‘I will’ at once.”

1293
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,240
“Then you’ll say it at Bennington next week.”

1294
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:59,960
Molly wheeled round.

1295
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:03,880
“Why, you surely will. Do you expect he’s going to stay here,
and you in Bennington?”

1296
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,440
And the campaigner sat back in her chair.

1297
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,480
“He? Goodness! Who is he?”

1298
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:13,120
“Child, child, you’re talking cross today because you’re at outs
with yourself.

1299
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:18,280
You’ve been at outs ever since you took this idea of leaving
the school and us and everything this needless way.

1300
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,520
You have not treated him right.

1301
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,920
And why, I can’t make out to save me.

1302
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,360
What have you found out all of a sudden?

1303
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:29,960
If he was not good enough for you, I⁠—But, oh, it’s a prime one
you’re losing, Molly.

1304
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:36,920
When a man like that stays faithful to a girl ’spite all the
chances he gets, her luck is come.”

1305
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:39,800
“Oh, my luck! People have different notions of luck.”

1306
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:40,840
“Notions!”

1307
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,400
“He has been very kind.”

1308
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,240
“Kind!”

1309
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:48,000
And now without further simmering, Mrs. Taylor’s wrath boiled
up and poured copiously over Molly Wood.

1310
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:48,760
“Kind!

1311
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,440
There’s a word you shouldn’t use, my dear.

1312
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,640
No doubt you can spell it.

1313
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,000
But more than its spelling I guess you don’t know.

1314
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:03,160
The children can learn what it means from some of the rest of
us folks that don’t spell so correct, maybe.”

1315
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,680
“Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor⁠—”

1316
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:05,640
“I can’t wait, deary.

1317
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:10,360
Since the roughness looks bigger to you than the diamond, you
had better go back to Vermont.

1318
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,200
I expect you’ll find better grammar there, deary.”

1319
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:18,400
The good dame stalked out, and across to her own cabin, and left
the angry girl among her boxes.

1320
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,680
It was in vain she fell to work upon them.

1321
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:27,760
Presently something had to be done over again, and when it was
the box held several chattels less than before the readjustment.

1322
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:46,080
She played a sort of desperate dominos to fit these objects in the space, but here were a paperweight, a portfolio, with two wretched volumes that no chink would
harbor; and letting them fall all at once, she straightened herself, still stormy with revolt, eyes and cheeks still hot from the sting of long-parried truth.

1323
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:54,360
There, on her wall still, was the miniature, the little silent
ancestress; and upon this face the girl’s glance rested.

1324
01:50:54,360 --> 01:51:02,720
It was as if she appealed to Grandmother Stark for support and
comfort across the hundred years which lay between them.

1325
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:14,120
So the flaxen girl on the wall and she among the boxes stood a moment face to
face in seeming communion, and then the descendant turned again to her work.

1326
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:21,680
But after a desultory touch here and there she drew a long breath
and walked to the open door.

1327
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:26,040
What use was in finishing today, when she had nearly a week?

1328
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:32,800
This first spurt of toil had swept the cabin bare of all indwelling
charm, and its look was chill.

1329
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:38,480
Across the lane his horse, the one he had “gentled” for her,
was grazing idly.

1330
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:43,720
She walked there and caught him, and led him to her gate.

1331
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:52,240
Mrs. Taylor saw her go in, and soon come out in riding-dress; and she watched
the girl throw the saddle on with quick ease⁠—the ease he had taught her.

1332
01:51:52,240 --> 01:52:03,000
Mrs. Taylor also saw the sharp cut she gave the horse, and laughed grimly to herself
in her window as horse and rider galloped into the beautiful sunny loneliness.

1333
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,320
To the punished animal this switching was new!

1334
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:18,200
and at its third repetition he turned his head in surprise, but was no more heeded
than were the bluffs and flowers where he was taking his own undirected choice of way.

1335
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:31,880
He carried her over ground she knew by heart⁠—Corncliff Mesa, Crowheart Butte, Westfall’s Crossing, Upper
Canyon; open land and woodland, pines and sagebrush, all silent and grave and lustrous in the sunshine.

1336
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:40,760
Once and again a ranchman greeted her, and wondered if she had forgotten who he was; once
she passed some cowpunchers with a small herd of steers, and they stared after her too.

1337
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:48,920
Bear Creek narrowed, its mountainsides drew near, its little falls began
to rush white in midday shadow, and the horse suddenly pricked his ears.

1338
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:53,600
Unguided, he was taking this advantage to go home.

1339
01:52:53,600 --> 01:53:08,080
Though he had made but little way⁠—a mere beginning yet⁠—on this trail over to Sunk Creek, here was already a Sunk
Creek friend whinnying good day to him, so he whinnied back and quickened his pace, and Molly started to life.

1340
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,720
What was Monte doing here?

1341
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:16,640
She saw the black horse she knew also, saddled, with reins
dragging on the trail as the rider had dropped them to dismount.

1342
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:24,800
A cold spring bubbled out beyond the next rock, and she knew
her lover’s horse was waiting for him while he drank.

1343
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:35,480
She pulled at the reins, but loosed them, for to turn and escape now was
ridiculous; and riding boldly round the rock, she came upon him by the spring.

1344
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:46,520
One of his arms hung up to its elbow in the pool, the other was crooked beside his head, but the
face was sunk downward against the shelving rock, so that she saw only his black, tangled hair.

1345
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:51,720
As her horse snorted and tossed his head she looked swiftly at
Monte, as if to question him.

1346
01:53:51,720 --> 01:54:00,040
Seeing now the sweat matted on his coat, and noting the white
rim of his eye, she sprang and ran to the motionless figure.

1347
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:13,840
A patch of blood at his shoulder behind stained the soft flannel shirt, spreading down
beneath his belt, and the man’s whole strong body lay slack and pitifully helpless.

1348
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:31,600
She touched the hand beside his head, but it seemed neither warm nor cold to her; she felt for the pulse, as nearly as she could remember the doctors did, but could
not tell whether she imagined or not that it was still; twice with painful care her fingers sought and waited for the beat, and her face seemed like one of listening.

1349
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:44,280
She leaned down and lifted his other arm and hand from the water, and as their ice-coldness reached her senses, clearly she saw the patch
near the shoulder she had moved grow wet with new blood, and at that sight she grasped at the stones upon which she herself now sank.

1350
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:56,480
She held tight by two rocks, sitting straight beside him, staring, and murmuring aloud, “I
must not faint; I will not faint;” and the standing horses looked at her, pricking their ears.

1351
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:15,840
In this cup-like spread of the ravine the sun shone warmly down, the tall red cliff was warm, the pines were a warm film and filter of green; outside
the shade across Bear Creek rose the steep, soft, open yellow hill, warm and high to the blue, and Bear Creek tumbled upon its sunsparkling stones.

1352
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:27,800
The two horses on the margin trail still looked at the spring and trees, where sat the
neat flaxen girl so rigid by the slack prone body in its flannel shirt and leathern chaps.

1353
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:30,120
Suddenly her face livened.

1354
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:33,320
“But the blood ran!” she exclaimed, as if to the horses, her
companions in this.

1355
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:36,800
She moved to him, and put her hand in through his shirt against
his heart.

1356
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:46,720
Next moment she had sprung up and was at his saddle, searching, then
swiftly went on to her own and got her small flask and was back beside him.

1357
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:53,960
Here was the cold water he had sought, and she put it against
his forehead and drenched the wounded shoulder with it.

1358
01:55:53,960 --> 01:56:06,600
Three times she tried to move him, so he might lie more easy, but his dead weight was
too much, and desisting, she sat close and raised his head to let it rest against her.

1359
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:14,240
Thus she saw the blood that was running from in front of the
shoulder also; but she said no more about fainting.

1360
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:28,360
She tore strips from her dress and soaked them, keeping them cold and wet upon both openings
of his wound, and she drew her pocketknife out and cut his shirt away from the place.

1361
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:36,000
As she continually rinsed and cleaned it, she watched his eyelashes,
long and soft and thick, but they did not stir.

1362
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:43,160
Again she tried the flask, but failed from being still too gentle,
and her searching eyes fell upon ashes near the pool.

1363
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:49,400
Still undispersed by the weather lay the small charred ends of a fire
he and she had made once here together, to boil coffee and fry trout.

1364
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:55,440
She built another fire now, and when the flames were going
well, filled her flask-cup from the spring and set it to heat.

1365
01:56:55,440 --> 01:57:00,000
Meanwhile, she returned to nurse his head and wound.

1366
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,720
Her cold water had stopped the bleeding.

1367
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:15,600
Then she poured her brandy in the steaming cup, and, made rough by
her desperate helplessness, forced some between his lips and teeth.

1368
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:22,840
Instantly, almost, she felt the tremble of life creeping back,
and as his deep eyes opened upon her she sat still and mute.

1369
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:42,720
But the gaze seemed luminous with an unnoting calm, and she wondered if perhaps he could not recognize her; she watched this internal clearness of his
vision, scarcely daring to breathe, until presently he began to speak, with the same profound and clear impersonality sounding in his slowly uttered words.

1370
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:47,240
“I thought they had found me. I expected they were going to kill
me.”

1371
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:57,200
He stopped, and she gave him more of the hot drink, which he took, still
lying and looking at her as if the present did not reach his senses.

1372
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,360
“I knew hands were touching me.

1373
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,440
I reckon I was not dead.

1374
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,920
I knew about them soon as they began, only I could not interfere.”


1375
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:06,720
He waited again.

1376
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:11,760
“It is mighty strange where I have been. No. Mighty natural.”


1377
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:20,120
Then he went back into his revery, and lay with his eyes still
full open upon her where she sat motionless.

1378
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:30,040
She began to feel a greater awe in this living presence than when it had been his body with
an ice-cold hand; and she quietly spoke his name, venturing scarcely more than a whisper.

1379
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,760
At this, some nearer thing wakened in his look.

1380
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:35,920
“But it was you all along,” he resumed.

1381
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,520
“It is you now. You must not stay⁠—”

1382
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:42,000
Weakness overcame him, and his eyes closed.

1383
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:50,800
She sat ministering to him, and when he roused again, he began
anxiously at once: “You must not stay.

1384
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:53,640
They would get you, too.”

1385
01:58:53,640 --> 01:59:00,720
She glanced at him with a sort of fierceness, then reached for
his pistol, in which was nothing but blackened empty cartridges.

1386
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:07,400
She threw these out and drew six from his belt, loaded the weapon,
and snapped shut its hinge.

1387
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,680
“Please take it,” he said, more anxious and more himself.

1388
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:14,360
“I ain’t worth tryin’ to keep. Look at me!”

1389
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:16,880
“Are you giving up?” she inquired, trying to put scorn in her
tone.

1390
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:19,080
Then she seated herself.

1391
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:21,520
“Where is the sense in both of us⁠—”

1392
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,360
“You had better save your strength,” she interrupted.

1393
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:26,920
He tried to sit up.

1394
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:29,040
“Lie down!” she ordered.

1395
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,280
He sank obediently, and began to smile.

1396
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:37,960
When she saw that, she smiled too, and unexpectedly took his
hand.

1397
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:40,800
“Listen, friend,” said she.

1398
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,840
“Nobody shall get you, and nobody shall get me. Now take some
more brandy.”

1399
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:50,440
“It must be noon,” said the cowpuncher, when she had drawn her
hand away from him.

1400
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:55,480
“I remember it was dark when⁠—when⁠—when I can remember.

1401
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:59,400
I reckon they were scared to follow me in so close to settlers.


1402
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:02,040
Else they would have been here.”

1403
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:05,080
“You must rest,” she observed.

1404
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:22,320
She broke the soft ends of some evergreen, and putting them beneath his head, went to the
horses, loosened the cinches, took off the bridles, led them to drink, and picketed them to feed.

1405
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:33,360
Further still, to leave nothing undone which she could herself manage, she took the horses’
saddles off to refold the blankets when the time should come, and meanwhile brought them for him.

1406
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,040
But he put them away from him.

1407
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:40,840
He was sitting up against a rock, stronger evidently, and asking
for cold water.

1408
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:47,040
His head was fire-hot, and the paleness beneath his swarthy skin
had changed to a deepening flush.

1409
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,720
“Only five miles!” she said to him, bathing his head.

1410
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:56,080
“Yes. I must hold it steady,” he answered, waving his hand at
the cliff.

1411
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:59,280
She told him to try and keep it steady until they got home.

1412
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,120
“Yes,” he repeated.

1413
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:04,080
“Only five miles. But it’s fightin’ to turn around.”

1414
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:11,960
Half aware that he was becoming lightheaded, he looked from the
rock to her and from her to the rock with dilating eyes.

1415
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,920
“We can hold it together,” she said.

1416
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,240
“You must get on your horse.”

1417
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:26,240
She took his handkerchief from round his neck, knotting it with her own, and to make more
bandage she ran to the roll of clothes behind his saddle and tore in halves a clean shirt.

1418
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:33,560
A handkerchief fell from it, which she seized also, and opening,
saw her own initials by the hem.

1419
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:51,560
Then she remembered: she saw again their first meeting, the swollen river, the overset stage, the unknown horseman who carried her to the bank on his saddle and went
away unthanked⁠—her whole first adventure on that first day of her coming to this new country⁠—and now she knew how her long-forgotten handkerchief had gone that day.

1420
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:58,200
She refolded it gently and put it back in his bundle, for there
was enough bandage without it.

1421
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:06,160
She said not a word to him, and he placed a wrong meaning upon
the look which she gave him as she returned to bind his shoulder.

1422
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:13,960
“It don’t hurt so much,” he assured her (though extreme pain was clearing his
head for the moment, and he had been able to hold the cliff from turning).

1423
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:17,040
“Yu’ must not squander your pity.”

1424
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:19,840
“Do not squander your strength,” said she.

1425
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:24,600
“Oh, I could put up a pretty good fight now!”

1426
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:31,680
But he tottered in showing her how strong he was, and she told
him that, after all, he was a child still.

1427
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:40,000
“Yes,” he slowly said, looking after her as she went to bring his
horse, “the same child that wanted to touch the moon, I guess.”

1428
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,320
And during the slow climb down into the saddle from a rock to which she
helped him he said, “You have got to be the man all through this mess.”

1429
02:02:46,320 --> 02:03:13,720
She saw his teeth clinched and his drooping muscles compelled by will; and as he rode and she walked to lend him support, leading her horse by a backward-stretched left hand, she counted off the distance to him
continually⁠—the increasing gain, the lessening road, the landmarks nearing and dropping behind; here was the tree with the wasp-nest gone; now the burned cabin was passed; now the cottonwoods at the ford were in sight.

1430
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:26,720
He was silent, and held to the saddle-horn, leaning more and more against his two hands clasped over it; and just
after they had made the crossing he fell, without a sound slipping to the grass, and his descent broken by her.

1431
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:29,720
But it started the blood a little, and she dared not leave him
to seek help.

1432
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:33,520
She gave him the last of the flask and all the water he craved.


1433
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,560
Revived, he managed to smile.

1434
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,480
“Yu’ see, I ain’t worth keeping.”

1435
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,120
“It’s only a mile,” said she.

1436
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:54,840
So she found a log, a fallen trunk, and he crawled to that, and from there crawled to his
saddle, and she marched on with him, talking, bidding him note the steps accomplished.

1437
02:03:54,840 --> 02:04:06,280
For the next half-mile they went thus, the silent man clinched on the horse, and by
his side the girl walking and cheering him forward, when suddenly he began to speak:⁠—

1438
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:09,640
“I will say goodbye to you now, ma’am.”

1439
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:11,560
She did not understand, at first, the significance of this.

1440
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:13,480
“He is getting away,” pursued the Virginian.

1441
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:17,800
“I must ask you to excuse me, ma’am.”

1442
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:21,200
It was a long while since her lord had addressed her as “ma’am.”


1443
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:28,440
As she looked at him in growing apprehension, he turned Monte
and would have ridden away, but she caught the bridle.

1444
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:32,720
“You must take me home,” said she, with ready inspiration.

1445
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:34,000
“I am afraid of the Indians.”

1446
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,840
“Why, you⁠—why, they’ve all gone. There he goes. Ma’am⁠—that
hawss⁠—”

1447
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:42,680
“No,” said she, holding firmly his rein and quickening her step.


1448
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:48,520
“A gentleman does not invite a lady to go out riding and leave
her.”

1449
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,400
His eyes lost their purpose.

1450
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:55,920
“I’ll cert’nly take you home. That sorrel has gone in there by
the wallow, and Judge Henry will understand.”

1451
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:06,520
With his eyes watching imaginary objects, he rode and rambled and it was now the
girl who was silent, except to keep his mind from its half-fixed idea of the sorrel.

1452
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:34,760
As he grew more fluent she hastened still more, listening to head off that notion of return, skilfully inventing questions to engage him, so that when she brought him to her gate she held him in a manner subjected, answering faithfully
the shrewd unrealities which she devised, whatever makeshifts she could summon to her mind; and next she had got him inside her dwelling and set him down docile, but now completely wandering; and then⁠—no help was at hand, even here.

1453
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:50,880
She had made sure of aid from next door, and there she hastened, to find the Taylor’s cabin locked and silent; and this meant that parents and
children were gone to drive; nor might she be luckier at her next nearest neighbors’, should she travel the intervening mile to fetch them.

1454
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:59,040
With a mind jostled once more into uncertainty, she returned
to her room, and saw a change in him already.

1455
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:13,360
Illness had stridden upon him; his face was not as she had left it, and the whole body, the splendid supple
horseman, showed sickness in every line and limb, its spurs and pistol and bold leather chaps a mockery of trappings.

1456
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:18,960
She looked at him, and decision came back to her, clear and steady.


1457
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,520
She supported him over to her bed and laid him on it.

1458
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:27,040
His head sank flat, and his loose, nerveless arms stayed as she
left them.

1459
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:36,040
Then among her packing-boxes and beneath the little miniature,
blue and flaxen and gold upon its lonely wall, she undressed him.

1460
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:46,000
He was cold, and she covered him to the face, and arranged the pillow, and
got from its box her scarlet and black Navajo blanket and spread it over him.

1461
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,120
There was no more that she could do, and she sat down by him
to wait.

1462
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:54,040
Among the many and many things that came into her mind was a
word he said to her lightly a long while ago.

1463
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:57,040
“Cowpunchers do not live long enough to get old,” he had told
her.

1464
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:02,520
And now she looked at the head upon the pillow, grave and strong,
but still the head of splendid, unworn youth.

1465
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:07,000
At the distant jingle of the wagon in the lane she was out, and
had met her returning neighbors midway.

1466
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:16,320
They heard her with amazement, and came in haste to the bedside; then Taylor
departed to spread news of the Indians and bring the doctor, twenty-five miles away.

1467
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:25,000
The two women friends stood alone again, as they had stood in
the morning when anger had been between them.

1468
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,440
“Kiss me, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor.

1469
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:32,240
“Now I will look after him⁠—and you’ll need some looking after
yourself.”

1470
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:45,360
But on returning from her cabin with what store she possessed of
lint and stimulants, she encountered a rebel, independent as ever.

1471
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:55,760
Molly would hear no talk about saving her strength, would not be in any room but this
one until the doctor should arrive; then perhaps it would be time to think about resting.

1472
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:04,960
So together the dame and the girl rinsed the man’s wound and wrapped him in clean things,
and did all the little that they knew⁠—which was, in truth, the very thing needed.

1473
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:07,480
Then they sat watching him toss and mutter.

1474
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:17,000
It was no longer upon Indians or the sorrel horse that his talk seemed
to run, or anything recent, apparently, always excepting his work.

1475
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:27,040
This flowingly merged with whatever scene he was inventing or living
again, and he wandered unendingly in that incompatible world we dream in.

1476
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:41,720
Through the medley of events and names, often thickly spoken, but rising at times to grotesque
coherence, the listeners now and then could piece out the reference from their own knowledge.

1477
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:54,840
“Monte,” for example, continually addressed, and Molly heard her own name, but invariably as
“Miss Wood”; nothing less respectful came out, and frequently he answered someone as “ma’am.”

1478
02:08:54,840 --> 02:09:01,440
At these fragments of revelation Mrs. Taylor abstained from speech,
but eyed Molly Wood with caustic reproach.

1479
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:11,840
As the night wore on, short lulls of silence intervened, and
the watchers were deceived into hope that the fever was abating.

1480
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:25,360
And when the Virginian sat quietly up in bed, essayed to move his bandage, and looked steadily
at Mrs. Taylor, she rose quickly and went to him with a question as to how he was doing.

1481
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:29,960
“Rise on your laigs, you polecat,” said he, “and tell them you’re
a liar.”

1482
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:45,160
The good dame gasped, then bade him lie down, and he obeyed her with that strange double understanding
of the delirious; for even while submitting, he muttered “liar,” “polecat,” and then “Trampas.”

1483
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:58,200
At that name light flashed on Mrs. Taylor, and she turned to Molly; and there was the girl
struggling with a fit of mirth at his speech; but the laughter was fast becoming a painful seizure.

1484
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:04,520
Mrs. Taylor walked Molly up and down, speaking immediately to
arrest her attention.

1485
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:06,880
“You might as well know it,” she said.

1486
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:11,200
“He would blame me for speaking of it, but where’s the harm all
this while after?

1487
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:13,920
And you would never hear it from his mouth.

1488
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:19,640
Molly, child, they say Trampas would kill him if he dared, and
that’s on account of you.”

1489
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:25,880
“I never saw Trampas,” said Molly, fixing her eyes upon the speaker.


1490
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:27,000
“No, deary.

1491
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:35,240
But before a lot of men⁠—Taylor has told me about it⁠—Trampas spoke
disrespectfully of you, and before them all he made Trampas say he was a liar.

1492
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:41,760
That is what he did when you were almost a stranger among us,
and he had not started seeing so much of you.

1493
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:45,760
I expect Trampas is the only enemy he ever had in this country.


1494
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:50,480
But he would never let you know about that.”

1495
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,920
“No,” whispered Molly; “I did not know.”

1496
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:56,640
“Steve!” the sick man now cried out, in poignant appeal.

1497
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,640
“Steve!”

1498
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:10,280
To the women it was a name unknown⁠—unknown as was also this deep inward
tide of feeling which he could no longer conceal, being himself no longer.

1499
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:13,400
“No, Steve,” he said next, and muttering followed.

1500
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:17,920
“It ain’t so!” he shouted; and then cunningly in a lowered voice,
“Steve, I have lied for you.”

1501
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,680
In time Mrs. Taylor spoke some advice.

1502
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:25,720
“You had better go to bed, child. You look about ready for the
doctor yourself.”

1503
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:28,240
“Then I will wait for him,” said Molly.

1504
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:35,680
So the two nurses continued to sit until darkness at the windows
weakened into gray, and the lamp was no more needed.

1505
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:37,960
Their patient was rambling again.

1506
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:48,880
Yet, into whatever scenes he went, there in some guise did the throb of his pain evidently
follow him, and he lay hitching his great shoulder as if to rid it of the cumbrance.

1507
02:11:48,880 --> 02:12:08,680
They waited for the doctor, not daring much more than to turn pillows and give what other ease they could; and then, instead of the doctor, came
a messenger, about noon, to say he was gone on a visit some thirty miles beyond, where Taylor had followed to bring him here as soon as might be.

1508
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:16,840
At this Molly consented to rest and to watch, turn about; and once she
was over in her friend’s house lying down, they tried to keep her there.

1509
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:33,040
But the revolutionist could not be put down, and when, as a last pretext, Mrs. Taylor urged the proprieties
and conventions, the pale girl from Vermont laughed sweetly in her face and returned to sit by the sick man.

1510
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:46,440
With the approach of the second night his fever seemed to rise and master him more completely than they
had yet seen it, and presently it so raged that the women called in stronger arms to hold him down.

1511
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:53,040
There were times when he broke out in the language of the roundup,
and Mrs. Taylor renewed her protests.

1512
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:59,960
“Why,” said Molly, “don’t you suppose I knew they could swear?”


1513
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:04,120
So the dame, in deepening astonishment and affection, gave up
these shifts at decorum.

1514
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:07,880
Nor did the delirium run into the intimate, coarse matters that
she dreaded.

1515
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:19,080
The cowpuncher had lived like his kind, but his natural daily thoughts
were clean, and came from the untamed but unstained mind of a man.

1516
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:31,960
And toward morning, as Mrs. Taylor sat taking her turn, suddenly he
asked had he been sick long, and looked at her with a quieted eye.

1517
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:36,920
The wandering seemed to drop from him at a stroke, leaving him
altogether himself.

1518
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:47,280
He lay very feeble, and inquired once or twice of his state and how he came here; nor
was anything left in his memory of even coming to the spring where he had been found.

1519
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:50,200
When the doctor arrived, he pronounced that it would be long⁠—or
very short.

1520
02:13:50,200 --> 02:14:08,600
He praised their clean water treatment; the wound was fortunately well up on the shoulder, and gave so far no bad signs; there were not any bad signs; and the blood and
strength of the patient had been as few men’s were; each hour was now an hour nearer certainty, and meanwhile⁠—meanwhile the doctor would remain as long as he could.

1521
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:10,360
He had many inquiries to satisfy.

1522
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:17,200
Dusty fellows would ride up, listen to him, and reply, as they
rode away, “Don’t yu’ let him die, Doc.”

1523
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:23,440
And Judge Henry sent over from Sunk Creek to answer for any attendance
or medicine that might help his foreman.

1524
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:37,400
The country was moved with concern and interest; and in Molly’s ears its words of
good feeling seemed to unite and sum up a burden, “Don’t yu’ let him die, Doc.”

1525
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:41,320
The Indians who had done this were now in military custody.

1526
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:58,400
They had come unpermitted from a southern reservation, hunting, next thieving, and as the slumbering spirit roused in one or
two of the young and ambitious, they had ventured this in the secret mountains, and perhaps had killed a trapper found there.

1527
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:10,200
Editors immediately reared a tall war out of it; but from five Indians in a guardhouse waiting punishment not even an editor can
supply spar for more than two editions, and if the recent alarm was still a matter of talk anywhere, it was not here in the sickroom.

1528
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:20,520
Whichever way the case should turn, it was through Molly alone (the doctor told
her) that the wounded man had got this chance⁠—this good chance, he related.

1529
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:36,840
And he told her she had not done a woman’s part, but a man’s part, and now had no more to do; no more till the patient got well,
and could thank her in his own way, said the doctor, smiling, and supposing things that were not so⁠—misled perhaps by Mrs. Taylor.

1530
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:47,840
“I’m afraid I’ll be gone by the time he is well,” said Molly, coldly; and the discreet
physician said ah, and that she would find Bennington quite a change from Bear Creek.

1531
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:52,320
But Mrs. Taylor spoke otherwise, and at that the girl said: “I
shall stay as long as I am needed.

1532
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,320
I will nurse him.

1533
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:55,240
I want to nurse him.

1534
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:58,600
I will do everything for him that I can!” she exclaimed, with
force.

1535
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:03,600
“And that won’t be anything, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor, harshly.


1536
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:06,920
“A year of nursing don’t equal a day of sweetheart.”

1537
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:21,360
The girl took a walk⁠—she was of no more service in the room at present⁠—but she turned without going far, and Mrs. Taylor spied
her come to lean over the pasture fence and watch the two horses⁠—that one the Virginian had “gentled” for her, and his own Monte.

1538
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:34,480
During this suspense came a new call for the doctor, neighbors profiting by his visit to Bear Creek; and
in his going away to them, even under promise of quick return, Mrs. Taylor suspected a favorable sign.

1539
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:44,280
He kept his word as punctually as had been possible, arriving after some six hours with a confident
face, and spending now upon the patient a care not needed, save to reassure the bystanders.

1540
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:50,600
He spoke his opinion that all was even better than he could have
hoped it would be, so soon.

1541
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:59,200
Here was now the beginning of the fifth day; the wound’s look was wholesome, no
further delirium had come, and the fever had abated a degree while he was absent.

1542
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:06,440
He believed the serious danger-line lay behind, and (short of the
unforeseen) the man’s deep untainted strength would reassert its control.

1543
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:14,960
He had much blood to make, and must be cared for during weeks⁠—three,
four, five⁠—there was no saying how long yet.

1544
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:30,640
These next few days it must be utter quiet for him; he must not talk nor hear anything likely to disturb
him; and then the time for cheerfulness and gradual company would come⁠—sooner than later, the doctor hoped.

1545
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:40,560
So he departed, and sent next day some bottles, with further cautions regarding
the wound and dirt, and to say he should be calling the day after tomorrow.

1546
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:43,480
Upon that occasion he found two patients.

1547
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:47,800
Molly Wood lay in bed at Mrs. Taylor’s, filled with apology and
indignation.

1548
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:59,040
With little to do, and deprived of the strong stimulant of anxiety and action, her
strength had quite suddenly left her, so that she had spoken only in a sort of whisper.

1549
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:12,040
But upon waking from a long sleep, after Mrs. Taylor had taken her firmly, almost severely, in hand, her natural voice had
returned, and now the chief treatment the doctor gave her was a sort of scolding, which it pleased Mrs. Taylor to hear.

1550
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:25,320
The doctor even dropped a phrase concerning the arrogance of strong nerves in slender bodies, and of undertaking
several people’s work when several people were at hand to do it for themselves, and this pleased Mrs. Taylor remarkably.

1551
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:27,960
As for the wounded man, he was behaving himself properly.

1552
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:32,600
Perhaps in another week he could be moved to a more cheerful
room.

1553
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:36,520
Just now, with cleanliness and pure air, any barn would do.

1554
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:43,720
“We are real lucky to have such a sensible doctor in the country,”
Mrs. Taylor observed, after the physician had gone.

1555
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:45,240
“No doubt,” said Molly.

1556
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:47,280
“He said my room was a barn.”

1557
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:52,440
“That’s what you’ve made it, deary. But sick men don’t notice
much.”

1558
02:18:52,440 --> 02:19:03,160
Nevertheless, one may believe, without going widely astray, that illness, so far from
veiling, more often quickens the perceptions⁠—at any rate those of the naturally keen.

1559
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:12,880
On a later day⁠—and the interval was brief⁠—while Molly was on her second drive to
take the air with Mrs. Taylor, that lady informed her that the sick man had noticed.

1560
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:22,840
“And I could not tell him things liable to disturb him,” said she,
“and so I⁠—well, I expect I just didn’t exactly tell him the facts.

1561
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:26,680
I said yes, you were packing up for a little visit to your folks.


1562
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:30,760
They had not seen you for quite a while, I said.

1563
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:35,200
And he looked at those boxes kind of silent like.”

1564
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:36,760
“There’s no need to move him,” said Molly.

1565
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:39,120
“It is simpler to move them⁠—the boxes.

1566
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:44,960
I could take out some of my things, you know, just while he has
to be kept there.

1567
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:50,200
I mean⁠—you see, if the doctor says the room should be cheerful⁠—”


1568
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:52,440
“Yes, deary.”

1569
02:19:52,440 --> 02:20:00,400
“I will ask the doctor next time,” said Molly, “if he believes
I am⁠—competent to spread a rug upon a floor.”

1570
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:05,200
Molly’s references to the doctor were usually acid these days.


1571
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:10,680
And this he totally failed to observe, telling her when he came,
why, to be sure!

1572
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:12,120
the very thing!

1573
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:24,760
And if she could play cards or read aloud, or afford any other light distractions, provided
they did not lead the patient to talk and tire himself, that she would be most useful.

1574
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:34,960
Accordingly she took over the cribbage board, and came with unexpected
hesitation face to face again with the swarthy man she had saved and tended.

1575
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:44,000
He was not so swarthy now, but neat, with chin clean, and hair and mustache
trimmed and smooth, and he sat propped among pillows watching for her.

1576
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:49,120
“You are better,” she said, speaking first, and with uncertain
voice.

1577
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:54,640
“Yes. They have given me awdehs not to talk,” said the Southerner,
smiling.

1578
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:59,600
“Oh, yes. Please do not talk⁠—not today .”

1579
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:06,960
“No. Only this” ⁠—he looked at her, and saw her seem to shrink⁠—“thank
you for what you have done,” he said simply.

1580
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:15,080
She took tenderly the hand he stretched to her; and upon these
terms they set to work at cribbage.

1581
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:25,360
She won, and won again, and the third time laid down her cards
and reproached him with playing in order to lose.

1582
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:29,600
“No,” he said, and his eye wandered to the boxes.

1583
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:37,080
“But my thoughts get away from me. I’ll be strong enough to hold
them on the cyards next time, I reckon.”

1584
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:43,400
Many tones in his voice she had heard, but never the tone of
sadness until today.

1585
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:48,480
Then they played a little more, and she put away the board for
this first time.

1586
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:50,360
“You are going now?” he asked.

1587
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:53,840
“When I have made this room look a little less forlorn.

1588
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:56,840
They haven’t wanted to meddle with my things, I suppose.”

1589
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:02,320
And Molly stooped once again among the chattels destined for
Vermont.

1590
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:19,960
Out they came; again the bearskin was spread on the floor, various possessions and ornaments went back into
their ancient niches, the shelves grew comfortable with books, and, last, some flowers were stood on the table.

1591
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:23,040
“More like old times,” said the Virginian, but sadly.

1592
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:30,400
“It’s too bad,” said Molly, “you had to be brought into such
a looking place.”

1593
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:33,960
“And your folks waiting for you,” said he.

1594
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:39,120
“Oh, I’ll pay my visit later,” said Molly, putting the rug a
trifle straighter.

1595
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:49,080
“May I ask one thing?” pleaded the Virginian, and at the gentleness of his
voice her face grew rosy, and she fixed her eyes on him with a sort of dread.

1596
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,160
“Anything that I can answer,” said she.

1597
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:51,800
“Oh, yes.

1598
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:56,200
Did I tell yu’ to quit me, and did yu’ load up my gun and stay?


1599
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:58,680
Was that a real business?

1600
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:01,440
I have been mixed up in my haid.”

1601
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,800
“That was real,” said Molly.

1602
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,760
“What else was there to do?”

1603
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:07,400
“Just nothing⁠—for such as you!” he exclaimed.

1604
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:16,000
“My haid has been mighty crazy; and that little grandmother of
yours yondeh, she⁠—but I can’t just quite catch

1605
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:28,040
ahold of these things”⁠—he passed a hand over his forehead⁠—“so many⁠—or else one right
along⁠—well, it’s all foolishness!” he concluded, with something almost savage in his tone.

1606
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:32,120
And after she had gone from the cabin he lay very still, looking
at the miniature on the wall.

1607
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:37,360
He was in another sort of mood the next time, cribbage not interesting
him in the least.

1608
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:39,680
“Your folks will be wondering about you,” said he.

1609
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:44,480
“I don’t think they will mind which month I go to them,” said
Molly.

1610
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:46,400
“Especially when they know the reason.”

1611
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,360
“Don’t let me keep you, ma’am,” said he.

1612
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:55,880
Molly stared at him; but he pursued, with the same edge lurking
in his slow words: “Though I’ll never forget.

1613
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:58,960
How could I forget any of all you have done⁠—and been?

1614
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:02,920
If there had been none of this, why, I had enough to remember!


1615
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:04,720
But please don’t stay, ma’am.

1616
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:11,440
We’ll say I had a claim when yu’ found me pretty well dead, but
I’m gettin’ well, yu’ see⁠—right smart, too!”

1617
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:17,120
“I can’t understand, indeed I can’t,” said Molly, “why you’re
talking so!”

1618
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:23,000
He seemed to have certain moods when he would address her as
“ma’am,” and this she did not like, but could not prevent.

1619
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,160
“Oh, a sick man is funny. And yu’ know I’m grateful to you.”

1620
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,600
“Please say no more about that, or I shall go this afternoon.


1621
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,160
I don’t want to go.

1622
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:33,880
I am not ready.

1623
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:36,640
I think I had better read something now.”

1624
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:36,800
“Why, yes.

1625
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,760
That’s cert’nly a good notion.

1626
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:42,320
Why, this is the best show you’ll ever get to give me education.


1627
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:45,760
Won’t yu’ please try that Emma book now, ma’am?

1628
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:48,400
Listening to you will be different.”

1629
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:50,480
This was said with softness and humility.

1630
02:24:50,480 --> 02:25:00,600
Uncertain⁠—as his gravity often left her⁠—precisely what he meant by what he said, Molly proceeded
with Emma, slackly at first, but soon with the enthusiasm that Miss Austen invariably gave her.

1631
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:11,920
She held the volume and read away at it, commenting briefly, and then, finishing
a chapter of the sprightly classic, found her pupil slumbering peacefully.

1632
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:15,160
There was no uncertainty about that.

1633
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:19,360
“You couldn’t be doing a healthier thing for him, deary,” said
Mrs. Taylor.

1634
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:24,440
“If it gets to make him wakeful, try something harder.”

1635
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:27,640
This was the lady’s scarcely sympathetic view.

1636
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:32,800
But it turned out to be not obscurity in which Miss Austen sinned.


1637
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:40,040
When Molly next appeared at the Virginian’s threshold, he said
plaintively, “I reckon I am a dunce.”

1638
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:41,240
And he sued for pardon.

1639
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:46,080
“When I waked up,” he said, “I was ashamed of myself for a plumb
half-hour.”

1640
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:50,200
Nor could she doubt this day that he meant what he said.

1641
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:59,280
His mood was again serene and gentle, and without referring to his singular words
that had distressed her, he made her feel his contrition, even in his silence.

1642
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,800
“I am right glad you have come,” he said.

1643
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:13,200
And as he saw her going to the bookshelf, he continued, with diffidence: “As regyards
that Emma book, yu’ see⁠—yu’ see, the doin’s and sayin’s of folks like them are above me.

1644
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:20,600
But I think” (he spoke most diffidently), “if yu’ could read me
something that was about something, I⁠—I’d be liable to keep awake.”

1645
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:21,960
And he smiled with a certain shyness.

1646
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:26,280
“Something about something?” queried Molly, at a loss.

1647
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:27,880
“Why, yes.

1648
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,520
Shakespeare.

1649
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:29,200
Henry the Fourth.

1650
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,320
The British king is fighting, and there is his son the prince.


1651
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:37,120
He cert’nly must have been a jim-dandy boy if that is all true.


1652
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,520
Only he would go around town with a mighty triflin’ gang.

1653
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:42,680
They sported and they held up citizens.

1654
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:45,880
And his father hated his travelling with trash like them.

1655
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:48,120
It was right natural⁠—the boy and the old man!

1656
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:50,640
But the boy showed himself a man too.

1657
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:58,440
He killed a big fighter on the other side who was another jim-dandy⁠—and
he was sorry for having it to do.”

1658
02:26:58,440 --> 02:26:59,880
The Virginian warmed to his recital.

1659
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:02,280
“I understand most all of that.

1660
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:05,720
There was a fat man kept everybody laughing.

1661
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:10,600
He was awful natural too; except yu’ don’t commonly meet ’em
so fat.

1662
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:15,320
But the prince⁠—that play is bedrock, ma’am!

1663
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:18,280
Have you got something like that?”

1664
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:20,600
“Yes, I think so,” she replied.

1665
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:22,440
“I believe I see what you would appreciate.”

1666
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:24,760
She took her Browning, her idol, her imagined affinity.

1667
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:33,680
For the pale decadence of New England had somewhat watered her good old Revolutionary blood too, and
she was inclined to think under glass and to live underdone⁠—when there were no Indians to shoot!

1668
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:45,480
She would have joyed to venture Paracelsus on him, and some lengthy rhymed
discourses; and she fondly turned leaves and leaves of her pet doggerel analytics.

1669
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:53,440
Pippa Passes and others she had to skip, from discreet motives⁠—pages which
he would have doubtless stayed awake at; but she chose a poem at length.

1670
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:55,760
This was better than Emma, he pronounced.

1671
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:56,840
And short.

1672
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:59,480
The horse was a good horse.

1673
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:11,960
He thought a man whose horse must not play out on him would watch the ground he was galloping
over for holes, and not be likely to see what color the rims of his animal’s eye-sockets were.

1674
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:17,480
You could not see them if you sat as you ought to for such a
hard ride.

1675
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:21,920
Of the next piece that she read him he thought still better.

1676
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:23,880
“And it is short,” said he.

1677
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:27,720
“But the last part drops.”

1678
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:32,360
Molly instantly exacted particulars.

1679
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:37,080
“The soldier should not have told the general he was killed,”
stated the cowpuncher.

1680
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,640
“What should he have told him, I’d like to know?” said Molly.


1681
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:41,440
“Why, just nothing.

1682
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:50,160
If the soldier could ride out of the battle all shot up, and tell his
general about their takin’ the town⁠—that was being gritty, yu’ see.

1683
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,080
But that truck at the finish⁠—will yu’ please say it again?”

1684
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:53,640
So Molly read:⁠—

1685
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:53,840
“ ‘You’re wounded!

1686
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:58,080
‘Nay,’ the soldier’s prideTouched to the quick, he said,‘I’m
killed, sire!’

1687
02:28:58,080 --> 02:29:01,360
And, his chief beside,Smiling the boy fell dead.”“

1688
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:07,160
‘Nay, I’m killed, sire,’ ” drawled the Virginian, amiably; for
(symptom of convalescence) his freakish irony was revived in him.

1689
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:12,920
“Now a man who was man enough to act like he did, yu’ see, would
fall dead without mentioning it.”

1690
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:15,960
None of Molly’s sweet girl friends had ever thus challenged Mr.
Browning.

1691
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:21,320
They had been wont to cluster over him with a joyous awe that
deepened proportionally with their misunderstanding.

1692
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:25,520
Molly paused to consider this novelty of view about the soldier.


1693
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:28,520
“He was a Frenchman, you know,” she said, under inspiration.

1694
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:30,240
“A Frenchman,” murmured the grave cowpuncher.

1695
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:36,080
“I never knowed a Frenchman, but I reckon they might perform
that class of foolishness.”

1696
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:37,880
“But why was it foolish?” she cried.

1697
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:40,280
“His soldier’s pride⁠—don’t you see?”

1698
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:40,600
“No.”

1699
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:42,240
Molly now burst into a luxury of discussion.

1700
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:56,480
She leaned toward her cowpuncher with bright eyes searching his; with elbow on knee and hand propping
chin, her lap became a slant, and from it Browning the poet slid and toppled, and lay unrescued.

1701
02:29:56,480 --> 02:30:13,160
For the slow cowpuncher unfolded his notions of masculine courage and modesty (though he did not deal in such high-sounding
names), and Molly forgot everything to listen to him, as he forgot himself and his inveterate shyness and grew talkative to her.

1702
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:19,320
“I would never have supposed that!” she would exclaim as she
heard him; or, presently again, “I never had such an idea!”

1703
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:25,280
And her mind opened with delight to these new things which came
from the man’s mind so simple and direct.

1704
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:32,720
To Browning they did come back, but the Virginian, though interested,
conceived a dislike for him.

1705
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:35,840
“He is a smarty,” said he, once or twice.

1706
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,880
“Now here is something,” said Molly.

1707
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:39,640
“I have never known what to think.”

1708
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:43,520
“Oh, Heavens!” murmured the sick man, smiling.

1709
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:45,560
“Is it short?”

1710
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:47,400
“Very short. Now please attend.”

1711
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:55,160
And she read him twelve lines about a lover who rowed to a beach
in the dusk, crossed a field, tapped at a pane, and was admitted.

1712
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:57,080
“That is the best yet,” said the Virginian.

1713
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:00,680
“There’s only one thing yu’ can think about that.”

1714
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:02,840
“But wait,” said the girl, swiftly.

1715
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:04,840
“Here is how they parted:⁠—

1716
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:14,920
“Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,And the sun looked over the mountain’s
rim⁠—And straight was a path of gold for him,And the need of a world of men for me.”

1717
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:21,280
“That is very, very true,” murmured the Virginian, dropping his
eyes from the girl’s intent ones.

1718
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,880
“Had they quarrelled?” she inquired.

1719
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:26,240
“Oh, no!”

1720
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:26,600
“But⁠—”

1721
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:29,080
“I reckon he loved her very much.”

1722
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:31,000
“Then you’re sure they hadn’t quarrelled?”

1723
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,760
“Dead sure, ma’am. He would come back afteh he had played some
more of the game.”

1724
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:35,800
“The game?”

1725
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:43,600
“Life, ma’am. Whatever he was a-doin’ in the world of men. That’s
a bedrock piece, ma’am!”

1726
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:48,520
“Well, I don’t see why you think it’s so much better than some
of the others.”

1727
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:51,520
“I could sca’cely explain,” answered the man.

1728
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,760
“But that writer does know something.”

1729
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:57,360
“I am glad they hadn’t quarrelled,” said Molly, thoughtfully.


1730
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:00,960
And she began to like having her opinions refuted.

1731
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:14,280
His bandages, becoming a little irksome, had to be shifted, and this turned their
discourse from literature to Wyoming; and Molly inquired, had he ever been shot before?

1732
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:16,280
Only once, he told her.

1733
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:20,320
“I have been lucky in having few fusses,” said he.

1734
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:22,400
“I hate them. If a man has to be killed⁠—”

1735
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:23,040
“You never⁠—” broke in Molly.

1736
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,440
She had started back a little.

1737
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:30,880
“Well,” she added hastily, “don’t tell me if⁠—”

1738
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:34,920
“I shouldn’t wonder if I got one of those Indians,” he said quietly.


1739
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,800
“But I wasn’t waitin’ to see!

1740
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:41,440
But I came mighty near doing for a white man that day.

1741
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:45,320
He had been hurtin’ a hawss.”

1742
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:46,480
“Hurting?” said Molly.

1743
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:47,760
“Injurin.’

1744
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,960
I will not tell yu’ about that.

1745
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:52,880
It would hurt yu’ to hear such things.

1746
02:32:52,880 --> 02:32:55,720
But hawsses⁠—don’t they depend on us?

1747
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:58,000
Ain’t they somethin’ like children?

1748
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,640
I did not lay up the man very bad.

1749
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:03,600
He was able to travel ’most right away.

1750
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:06,560
Why, you’d have wanted to kill him yourself!”

1751
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:08,640
So the Virginian talked, nor knew what he was doing to the girl.


1752
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:15,600
Nor was she aware of what she was receiving from him as he unwittingly
spoke himself out to her in these Browning meetings they had each day.

1753
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:16,840
But Mrs. Taylor grew pleased.

1754
02:33:16,840 --> 02:33:24,080
The kindly dame would sometimes cross the road to see if she
were needed, and steal away again after a peep at the window.

1755
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:37,840
There, inside, among the restored home treasures, sat the two: the rosy alert girl, sweet as
she talked or read to him; and he, the grave, half-weak giant among his wraps, watching her.

1756
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:48,640
Of her delayed home visit he never again spoke, either to her or to Mrs. Taylor; and
Molly veered aside from any trend of talk she foresaw was leading toward that subject.

1757
02:33:48,640 --> 02:34:05,280
But in those hours when no visitors came, and he was by himself in the quiet, he would lie often sombrely contemplating the girl’s
room, her little dainty knickknacks, her home photographs, all the delicate manifestations of what she came from and what she was.

1758
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:23,040
Strength was flowing back into him each day, and Judge Henry’s latest messenger had brought him clothes and mail from Sunk Creek and many
inquiries of kindness, and returned taking the news of the cowpuncher’s improvement, and how soon he would be permitted the fresh air.

1759
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:36,840
Hence Molly found him waiting in a flannel shirt of highly becoming shade, and with a silk
handkerchief knotted round his throat; and he told her it was good to feel respectable again.

1760
02:34:36,840 --> 02:34:49,960
She had come to read to him for the allotted time; and she threw around his shoulders
the scarlet and black Navajo blanket, striped with its splendid zigzags of barbarity.

1761
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:55,080
Thus he half sat, half leaned, languid but at ease.

1762
02:34:55,080 --> 02:35:10,280
In his lap lay one of the letters brought over by the messenger: and though she was midway in a book that engaged his full
attention⁠—David Copperfield⁠—his silence and absent look this morning stopped her, and she accused him of not attending.

1763
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:13,840
“No,” he admitted; “I am thinking of something else.”

1764
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:16,480
She looked at him with that apprehension which he knew.

1765
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:18,400
“It had to come,” said he.

1766
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:26,720
“And today I see my thoughts straighter than I’ve been up to
managing since⁠—since my haid got clear.

1767
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:31,440
And now I must say these thoughts⁠—if I can, if I can!”

1768
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:31,880
He stopped.

1769
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:36,640
His eyes were intent upon her; one hand was gripping the arm
of his chair.

1770
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:39,240
“You promised⁠—” trembled Molly.

1771
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:43,080
“I promised you should love me,” he sternly interrupted.

1772
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:49,200
“Promised that to myself. I have broken that word.”

1773
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:53,440
She shut David Copperfield mechanically, and grew white.

1774
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:58,760
“Your letter has come to me hyeh,” he continued, gentle again.


1775
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:00,520
“My⁠—” She had forgotten it.

1776
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:03,040
“The letter you wrote to tell me goodbye.

1777
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:10,680
You wrote it a little while ago⁠—not a month yet, but it’s away
and away long gone for me.”

1778
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:14,160
“I have never let you know⁠—” began Molly.

1779
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:22,160
“The doctor,” he interrupted once more, but very gently now,
“he gave awdehs I must be kept quiet.

1780
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:24,480
I reckon yu’ thought tellin’ me might⁠—”

1781
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:26,880
“Forgive me!” cried the girl.

1782
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:31,440
“Indeed I ought to have told you sooner! Indeed I had no excuse!”


1783
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:45,480
“Why, should yu’ tell me if yu’ preferred not? You had written. And you speak” (he lifted
the letter) “of never being able to repay kindness; but you have turned the tables.

1784
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:47,840
I can never repay you by anything!

1785
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:48,840
by anything!

1786
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:56,640
So I had figured I would just jog back to Sunk Creek and let
you get away, if you did not want to say that kind of goodbye.

1787
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,640
For I saw the boxes.

1788
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:03,880
Mrs. Taylor is too nice a woman to know the trick of lyin’, and
she could not deceive me.

1789
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:07,960
I have knowed yu’ were going away for good ever since I saw those
boxes.

1790
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:13,320
But now hyeh comes your letter, and it seems no way but I must
speak.

1791
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:15,960
I have thought a deal, lyin’ in this room.

1792
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:19,520
And⁠—today⁠—I can say what I have thought.

1793
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:21,400
I could not make you happy.”

1794
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,000
He stopped, but she did not answer.

1795
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,920
His voice had grown softer than whispering, but yet was not a
whisper.

1796
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:32,480
From its quiet syllables she turned away, blinded with sudden
tears.

1797
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:37,640
“Once, I thought love must surely be enough,” he continued.

1798
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:47,120
“And I thought if I could make you love me, you could learn me
to be less⁠—less⁠—more your kind.

1799
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:51,280
And I think I could give you a pretty good sort of love.

1800
02:37:51,280 --> 02:38:01,600
But that don’t help the little mean pesky things of day by day that
make roughness or smoothness for folks tied together so awful close.

1801
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,640
Mrs. Taylor hyeh⁠—she don’t know anything better than Taylor
does.

1802
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:08,360
She don’t want anything he can’t give her.

1803
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:11,440
Her friends will do for him and his for her.

1804
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:16,080
And when I dreamed of you in my home⁠—” he closed his eyes and
drew a long breath.

1805
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:18,720
At last he looked at her again.

1806
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:25,800
“This is no country for a lady. Will yu’ forget and forgive the
bothering I have done?”

1807
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:26,960
“Oh!” cried Molly.

1808
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:27,960
“Oh!”

1809
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:29,920
And she put her hands to her eyes.

1810
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:33,320
She had risen and stood with her face covered.

1811
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:39,840
“I surely had to tell you this all out, didn’t I?” said the cowpuncher,
faintly, in his chair.

1812
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,440
“Oh!” said Molly again.

1813
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:45,120
“I have put it clear how it is,” he pursued.

1814
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:50,040
“I ought to have seen from the start I was not the sort to keep
you happy.”

1815
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:55,560
“But,” said Molly⁠—“but I⁠—you ought⁠—please try to keep me happy!”


1816
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:58,760
And sinking by his chair, she hid her face on his knees.

1817
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:05,960
Speechless, he bent down and folded her round, putting his hands
on the hair that had been always his delight.

1818
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:07,600
Presently he whispered:⁠—

1819
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:10,200
“You have beat me; how can I fight this?”

1820
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:11,280
She answered nothing.

1821
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:14,960
The Navajo’s scarlet and black folds fell over both.

1822
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:25,840
Not with words, not even with meeting eyes, did the two plight
their troth in this first new hour.

1823
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:43,560
So they remained long, the fair head nesting in the great arms, and the black head laid against it, while over the silent
room presided the little Grandmother Stark in her frame, rosy, blue, and flaxen, not quite familiar, not quite smiling.

1824
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:44,000
CHAPTER XXVIII

1825
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,520
No Dream to Wake from

1826
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:51,120
For a long while after she had left him, he lay still, stretched
in his chair.

1827
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:56,120
His eyes were fixed steadily upon the open window and the sunshine
outside.

1828
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:59,920
There he watched the movement of the leaves upon the green cottonwoods.


1829
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:03,880
What had she said to him when she went?

1830
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:07,360
She had said, “Now I know how unhappy I have been.”

1831
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:13,880
These sweet words he repeated to himself over and over, fearing
in some way that he might lose them.

1832
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:23,920
They almost slipped from him at times; but with a jump of his mind he caught
them again and held them⁠—and then⁠—“I’m not all strong yet,” he murmured.

1833
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:25,840
“I must have been very sick.”

1834
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:31,000
And, weak from his bullet wound and fever, he closed his eyes
without knowing it.

1835
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:38,480
There were the cottonwoods again, waving, waving; and he felt
the cool, pleasant air from the window.

1836
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:43,760
He saw the light draught stir the ashes in the great stone fireplace.


1837
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,240
“I have been asleep,” he said.

1838
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:49,080
“But she was cert’nly here herself.

1839
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:50,360
Oh, yes.

1840
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:51,360
Surely.

1841
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:57,960
She always has to go away every day because the doctor says⁠—why,
she was readin’!” he broke off, aloud.

1842
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:59,840
“David Copperfield.”

1843
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:01,120
There it was on the floor.

1844
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:04,520
“Aha! nailed you anyway!” he said.

1845
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:07,880
“But how scared I am of myself!⁠—You’re a fool.

1846
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:09,160
Of course it’s so.

1847
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:12,680
No fever business could make yu’ feel like this.”

1848
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:21,600
His eye dwelt awhile on the fireplace, next on the deer horns, and
next it travelled toward the shelf where her books were; but it

1849
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:23,240
stopped before reaching them.

1850
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:32,200
“Better say off the names before I look,” said he.

1851
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:34,400
“I’ve had a heap o’ misreading visions.

1852
02:41:34,400 --> 02:41:40,480
And⁠—and supposin’⁠—if this was just my sickness fooling me some
more⁠—I’d want to die.

1853
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:41,280
I would die!

1854
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:42,520
Now we’ll see.

1855
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:54,080
If Copperfield is on the floor” (he looked stealthily to be sure that it was), “then she was
readin’ to me when everything happened, and then there should be a hole in the book row, top, left.

1856
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:59,960
Top, left,” he repeated, and warily brought his glance to the
place.

1857
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:01,640
“Proved!” he cried.

1858
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:02,760
“It’s all so!”

1859
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:05,600
He now noticed the miniature of Grandmother Stark.

1860
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:08,720
“You are awful like her,” he whispered.

1861
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:14,120
“You’re cert’nly awful like her. May I kiss you too, ma’am?”

1862
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:16,520
Then, tottering, he rose from his sick-chair.

1863
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:24,040
The Navajo blanket fell from his shoulders, and gradually, experimentally,
he stood upright.

1864
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:37,000
Helping himself with his hand slowly along the wall of the room, and round to the opposite wall with many
a pause, he reached the picture, and very gently touched the forehead of the ancestral dame with his lips.

1865
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:41,520
“I promise to make your little girl happy,” he whispered.

1866
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:52,360
He almost fell in stooping to the portrait, but caught himself
and stood carefully quiet, trembling, and speaking to himself.

1867
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:54,480
“Where is your strength?” he demanded.

1868
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:57,760
“I reckon it is joy that has unsteadied your laigs.”

1869
02:42:57,760 --> 02:42:58,480
The door opened.

1870
02:42:58,480 --> 02:43:00,960
It was she, come back with his dinner.

1871
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:06,880
“My Heavens!” she said; and setting the tray down, she rushed
to him.

1872
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:10,360
She helped him back to his chair, and covered him again.

1873
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:17,920
He had suffered no hurt, but she clung to him; and presently
he moved and let himself kiss her with fuller passion.

1874
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:20,040
“I will be good,” he whispered.

1875
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:21,720
“You must,” she said.

1876
02:43:21,720 --> 02:43:24,040
“You looked so pale!”

1877
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:26,640
“You are speakin’ low like me,” he answered.

1878
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:29,680
“But we have no dream we can wake from.”

1879
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:33,840
Had she surrendered on this day to her cowpuncher, her wild man?


1880
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:35,520
Was she forever wholly his?

1881
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:41,240
Had the Virginian’s fire so melted her heart that no rift in
it remained?

1882
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:44,600
So she would have thought if any thought had come to her.

1883
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:49,920
But in his arms today, thought was lost in something more divine.


1884
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:51,240
CHAPTER XXIX

1885
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:52,440
Word to Bennington

1886
02:43:52,440 --> 02:44:02,800
They kept their secret for a while, or at least they had that special joy of believing
that no one in all the world but themselves knew this that had happened to them.

1887
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:09,240
But I think that there was one person who knew how to keep a
secret even better than these two lovers.

1888
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:12,680
Mrs. Taylor made no remarks to anyone whatever.

1889
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:19,640
Nobody on Bear Creek, however, was so extraordinarily cheerful
and serene.

1890
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:30,200
That peculiar severity which she had manifested in the days when
Molly was packing her possessions, had now altogether changed.

1891
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:34,400
In these days she was endlessly kind and indulgent to her “deary.”


1892
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:47,840
Although, as a housekeeper, Mrs. Taylor believed in punctuality at meals, and visited her offspring with discipline
when they were late without good and sufficient excuse, Molly was now exempt from the faintest hint of reprimand.

1893
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:52,680
“And it’s not because you’re not her mother,” said George Taylor,
bitterly.

1894
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:54,760
“She used to get it, too.

1895
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,440
And we’re the only ones that get it.

1896
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:59,720
There she comes, just as we’re about ready to quit!

1897
02:44:59,720 --> 02:45:02,000
Aren’t you going to say nothing to her?”

1898
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,680
“George,” said his mother, “when you’ve saved a man’s life it’ll
be time for you to talk.”

1899
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:16,240
So Molly would come in to her meals with much irregularity; and her
remarks about the imperfections of her clock met with no rejoinder.

1900
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:24,960
And yet one can scarcely be so severe as had been Mrs. Taylor,
and become wholly as mild as milk.

1901
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:35,320
There was one recurrent event that could invariably awaken hostile
symptoms in the dame.

1902
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:41,200
Whenever she saw a letter arrive with the Bennington postmark
upon it, she shook her fist at that letter.

1903
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:44,840
“What’s family pride?” she would say to herself.

1904
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:51,360
“Taylor could be a Son of the Revolution if he’d a mind to. I
wonder if she has told her folks yet.”

1905
02:45:51,360 --> 02:46:07,080
And when letters directed to Bennington would go out, Mrs. Taylor would inspect every one as if its
envelope ought to grow transparent beneath her eyes, and yield up to her its great secret, if it had one.

1906
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:23,320
But in truth these letters had no great secret to yield up, until one day⁠—yes;
one day Mrs. Taylor would have burst, were bursting a thing that people often did.

1907
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:39,920
Three letters were the cause of this emotion on Mrs. Taylor’s part; one addressed to Bennington, one to Dunbarton,
and the third⁠—here was the great excitement⁠—to Bennington, but not in the little schoolmarm’s delicate writing.

1908
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:45,480
A man’s hand had traced those plain, steady vowels and consonants.


1909
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:49,560
“It’s come!” exclaimed Mrs. Taylor, at this sight.

1910
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:53,240
“He has written to her mother himself.”

1911
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:58,920
That is what the Virginian had done, and here is how it had come
about.

1912
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:02,280
The sick man’s convalescence was achieved.

1913
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:13,320
The weeks had brought back to him, not his whole strength yet⁠—that could come only by
many miles of open air on the back of Monte; but he was strong enough now to get strength.

1914
02:47:13,320 --> 02:47:18,640
When a patient reaches this stage, he is out of the woods.

1915
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:21,280
He had gone for a little walk with his nurse.

1916
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:30,600
They had taken (under the doctor’s recommendation) several such little walks,
beginning with a five-minute one, and at last today accomplishing three miles.

1917
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:33,640
“No, it has not been too far,” said he.

1918
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:37,240
“I am afraid I could walk twice as far.”

1919
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:37,960
“Afraid?”

1920
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:44,320
“Yes. Because it means I can go to work again. This thing we
have had together is over.”

1921
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:46,040
For reply, she leaned against him.

1922
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,680
“Look at you!” he said.

1923
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:56,560
“Only a little while ago you had to help me stand on my laigs.
And now⁠—” For a while there was silence between them.

1924
02:47:56,560 --> 02:48:00,640
“I have never had a right down sickness before,” he presently
went on.

1925
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:11,800
“Not to remember, that is. If any person had told me I could enjoy such a
thing⁠—” He said no more, for she reached up, and no more speech was possible.

1926
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:14,280
“How long has it been?” he next asked her.

1927
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:15,320
She told him.

1928
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:17,760
“Well, if it could be forever⁠—no.

1929
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:21,560
Not forever with no more than this.

1930
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:24,240
I reckon I’d be sick again!

1931
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:28,640
But if it could be forever with just you and me, and no one else
to bother with.

1932
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:31,600
But any longer would not be doing right by your mother.

1933
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:34,480
She would have a right to think ill of me.”

1934
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:35,840
“Oh!” said the girl.

1935
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:36,960
“Let us keep it.”

1936
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:40,400
“Not after I am gone. Your mother must be told.”

1937
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:44,000
“It seems so⁠—can’t we⁠—oh, why need anybody know?”

1938
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:50,800
“Your mother ain’t ‘anybody.’ She is your mother. I feel mighty
responsible to her for what I have done.”

1939
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:51,840
“But I did it!”

1940
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:58,280
“Do you think so? Your mother will not think so. I am going to
write to her today.”

1941
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:08,640
“You! Write to my mother! Oh, then everything will be so different!
They will all⁠—” Molly stopped before the rising visions of Bennington.

1942
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:15,920
Upon the fairytale that she had been living with her cowboy lover
broke the voices of the world.

1943
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:20,160
She could hear them from afar.

1944
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:25,080
She could see the eyes of Bennington watching this man at her
side.

1945
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:29,640
She could imagine the ears of Bennington listening for slips
in his English.

1946
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:34,160
There loomed upon her the round of visits which they would have
to make.

1947
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:47,680
The ringing of the doorbells, the waiting in drawing-rooms for the mistress to descend and utter her prepared
congratulations, while her secret eye devoured the Virginian’s appearance, and his manner of standing and sitting.

1948
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:51,440
He would be wearing gloves, instead of fringed gauntlets of buckskin.


1949
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:56,920
In a smooth black coat and waistcoat, how could they perceive
the man he was?

1950
02:49:56,920 --> 02:50:02,720
During those short formal interviews, what would they ever find
out of the things that she knew about him?

1951
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:04,600
The things for which she was proud of him?

1952
02:50:04,600 --> 02:50:23,920
He would speak shortly and simply; they would say, “Oh, yes!” and “How different you must find this from Wyoming!”⁠—and then,
after the door was shut behind his departing back they would say⁠—He would be totally underrated, not in the least understood.

1953
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:25,920
Why should he be subjected to this?

1954
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:27,120
He should never be!

1955
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:37,640
Now in all these half-formed, hurried, distressing thoughts which
streamed through the girl’s mind, she altogether forgot one truth.

1956
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:42,920
True it was that the voice of the world would speak as she imagined.


1957
02:50:42,920 --> 02:51:01,440
True it was that in the eyes of her family and acquaintance this lover of her choice would be examined even more like a specimen than are
other lovers upon these occasions: and all accepted lovers have to face this ordeal of being treated like specimens by the other family.

1958
02:51:01,440 --> 02:51:02,680
But dear me!

1959
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:06,040
most of us manage to stand it, don’t we?

1960
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:12,200
It isn’t, perhaps, the most delicious experience that we can
recall in connection with our engagement.

1961
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:13,600
But it didn’t prove fatal.

1962
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:15,320
We got through it somehow.

1963
02:51:15,320 --> 02:51:27,360
We dined with Aunt Jane, and wined with Uncle Joseph, and perhaps had two fingers given to us
by old Cousin Horatio, whose enormous fortune was of the greatest importance to everybody.

1964
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:33,000
And perhaps fragments of the other family’s estimate of us subsequently
reached our own ears.

1965
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:41,720
But if a chosen lover cannot stand being treated as a specimen by the
other family, he’s a very weak vessel, and not worth any good girl’s love.

1966
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:43,480
That’s all I can say for him.

1967
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:55,000
Now the Virginian was scarcely what even his enemy would term a weak vessel; and Molly’s
jealousy of the impression which he might make upon Bennington was vastly superfluous.

1968
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:08,880
She should have known that he would indeed care to make a good impression; but that such anxiety on his part would be
wholly for her sake, that in the eyes of her friends she might stand justified in taking him for her wedded husband.

1969
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,880
So far as he was concerned apart from her

1970
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:18,040
, Aunt Jane and Uncle Joseph might say anything they pleased,
or think anything they pleased.

1971
02:52:18,040 --> 02:52:21,040
His character was open for investigation.

1972
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:24,200
Judge Henry would vouch for him.

1973
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:30,760
This is what he would have said to his sweetheart had she but
revealed to him her perturbations.

1974
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:36,920
But she did not reveal them; and they were not of the order that
he with his nature was likely to divine.

1975
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:45,640
I do not know what good would have come from her speaking out to him, unless
that perfect understanding between lovers which indeed is a good thing.

1976
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:53,720
But I do not believe that he could have reassured her; and I am
certain that she could not have prevented his writing to her mother.

1977
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:58,880
“Well, then,” she sighed at last, “if you think so, I will tell
her.”

1978
02:52:58,880 --> 02:53:11,600
That sigh of hers, be it well understood, was not only because of those far-off
voices which the world would in consequence of her news be lifting presently.

1979
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:24,920
It came also from bidding farewell to the fairytale which she must leave now; that land in
which she and he had been living close together alone, unhindered, unmindful of all things.

1980
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:27,520
“Yes, you will tell her,” said her lover.

1981
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:30,640
“And I must tell her too.”

1982
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:32,480
“Both of us?” questioned the girl.

1983
02:53:32,480 --> 02:53:34,160
What would he say to her mother?

1984
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:38,200
How would her mother like such a letter as he would write to
her?

1985
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:41,000
Suppose he should misspell a word?

1986
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Would not sentences from him at this time⁠—written sentences⁠—be
a further bar to his welcome acceptance at Bennington?

1987
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,320
“Why don’t you send messages by me?” she asked him.

1988
02:53:54,320 --> 02:53:55,160
He shook his head.

1989
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:58,040
“She is not going to like it, anyway,” he answered.

1990
02:53:58,040 --> 02:54:02,000
“I must speak to her direct. It would be like shirking.”

1991
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:10,080
Molly saw how true his instinct was here; and a little flame
shot upward from the glow of her love and pride in him.

1992
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:14,440
Oh, if they could all only know that he was like this when you
understood him!

1993
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:19,040
She did not dare say out to him what her fear was about this
letter of his to her mother.

1994
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:24,360
She did not dare because⁠—well, because she lacked a little faith.


1995
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:25,640
That is it, I am afraid.

1996
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:28,920
And for that sin she was her own punishment.

1997
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:45,000
For in this day, and in many days to come, the pure joy of her love was vexed and clouded, all
through a little lack of faith; while for him, perfect in his faith, his joy was like crystal.

1998
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:48,600
“Tell me what you’re going to write,” she said.

1999
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:51,920
He smiled at her.

2000
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:53,040
“No.”

2001
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:55,560
“Aren’t you going to let me see it when it’s done?”

2002
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:56,200
“No.”

2003
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:58,400
Then a freakish look came into his eyes.

2004
02:54:58,400 --> 02:55:00,960
“I’ll let yu’ see anything I write to other women.”

2005
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:02,520
And he gave her one of his long kisses.

2006
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:11,600
“Let’s get through with it together,” he suggested, when they were
once more in his sickroom, that room which she had given to him.

2007
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:17,680
“You’ll sit one side o’ the table, and I’ll sit the other, and
we’ll go ahaid; and pretty soon it will be done.”

2008
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:20,080
“O dear!” she said.

2009
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:23,080
“Yes, I suppose that is the best way.”

2010
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:25,560
And so, accordingly, they took their places.

2011
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:28,080
The inkstand stood between them.

2012
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:34,120
Beside each of them she distributed paper enough, almost, for
a presidential message.

2013
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:36,400
And pens and pencils were in plenty.

2014
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:41,680
Was this not the headquarters of the Bear Creek schoolmarm?

2015
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:48,320
“Why, aren’t you going to do it in pencil first?” she exclaimed,
looking up from her vacant sheet.

2016
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:51,120
His pen was moving slowly, but steadily.

2017
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:57,240
“No, I don’t reckon I need to,” he answered, with his nose close
to the paper.

2018
02:55:57,240 --> 02:55:59,880
“Oh, damnation, there’s a blot!”

2019
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:03,920
He tore his spoiled beginning in small bits, and threw them into
the fireplace.

2020
02:56:03,920 --> 02:56:10,440
“You’ve got it too full,” he commented; and taking the inkstand,
he tipped a little from it out of the window.

2021
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:13,600
She sat lost among her false starts.

2022
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:17,000
Had she heard him swear, she would not have minded.

2023
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,160
She rather liked it when he swore.

2024
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:23,760
He possessed that quality in his profanity of not offending by
it.

2025
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:30,800
It is quite wonderful how much worse the same word will sound
in one man’s lips than in another’s.

2026
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:33,440
But she did not hear him.

2027
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:37,880
Her mind was among a litter of broken sentences.

2028
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:43,120
Each thought which she began ran out into the empty air, or came
against some stone wall.

2029
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:54,320
So there she sat, her eyes now upon that inexorable blank sheet that lay before her,
waiting, and now turned with vacant hopelessness upon the sundry objects in the room.

2030
02:56:54,320 --> 02:57:04,480
And while she thus sat accomplishing nothing, opposite to her the
black head bent down, and the steady pen moved from phrase to phrase.

2031
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:08,840
She became aware of his gazing at her, flushed and solemn.

2032
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:15,080
That strange color of the seawater, which she could never name,
was lustrous in his eyes.

2033
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:16,640
He was folding his letter.

2034
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:19,320
“You have finished?” she said.

2035
02:57:19,320 --> 02:57:19,920
“Yes.”

2036
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:21,720
His voice was very quiet.

2037
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:24,000
“I feel like an honester man.”

2038
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:30,320
“Perhaps I can do something tonight at Mrs. Taylor’s,” she said,
looking at her paper.

2039
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:33,120
On it were a few words crossed out.

2040
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:35,440
This was all she had to show.

2041
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:41,920
At this set task in letter-writing, the cowpuncher had greatly
excelled the schoolmarm!

2042
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:48,040
But that night, while he lay quite fast asleep in his bed, she
was keeping vigil in her room at Mrs. Taylor’s.

2043
02:57:48,040 --> 02:57:57,440
Accordingly, the next day, those three letters departed for the
mail, and Mrs. Taylor consequently made her exclamation, “It’s come!”

2044
02:57:57,440 --> 02:58:05,240
On the day before the Virginian returned to take up his work
at Judge Henry’s ranch, he and Molly announced their news.

2045
02:58:05,240 --> 02:58:17,560
What Molly said to Mrs. Taylor and what Mrs. Taylor said to her,
is of no interest to us, though it was of much to them.

2046
02:58:17,560 --> 02:58:24,040
But Mr. McLean happened to make a call quite early in the morning
to inquire for his friend’s health.

2047
02:58:24,040 --> 02:58:30,560
“Lin,” began the Virginian, “there is no harm in your knowing
an hour or so before the rest, I am⁠—”

2048
02:58:30,560 --> 02:58:33,800
“Lord!” said Mr. McLean, indulgently.

2049
02:58:33,800 --> 02:58:38,520
“Everybody has knowed that since the day she found yu’ at the
spring.”

2050
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:42,080
“It was not so, then,” said the Virginian, crossly.

2051
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:44,880
“Lord! Everybody has knowed it right along.”

2052
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,480
“Hmp!” said the Virginian.

2053
02:58:46,480 --> 02:58:50,320
“I didn’t know this country was that rank with gossips.”

2054
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:53,320
Mr. McLean laughed mirthfully at the lover.

2055
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:57,760
“Well,” he said, “Mrs. McLean will be glad.

2056
02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:01,880
She told me to give yu’ her congratulations quite a while ago.


2057
02:59:01,880 --> 02:59:06,040
I was to have ’em ready just as soon as ever yu’ asked for ’em
yourself.”

2058
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:10,720
Lin had been made a happy man some twelve months previous to
this.

2059
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:18,000
And now, by way of an exchange of news, he added: “We’re expectin’
a little McLean down on Box Elder.

2060
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:21,440
That’s what you’ll be expectin’ some of these days, I hope.”

2061
02:59:21,440 --> 02:59:24,560
“Yes,” murmured the Virginian, “I hope so too.”

2062
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:30,720
“And I don’t guess,” said Lin, “that you and I will do much shufflin’
of other folks’ children any more.”

2063
02:59:30,720 --> 02:59:35,960
Whereupon he and the Virginian shook hands silently, and understood
each other very well.

2064
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:45,600
On the day that the Virginian parted with Molly, beside the weight of farewell
which lay heavy on his heart, his thoughts were also grave with news.

2065
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:50,360
The cattle thieves had grown more audacious.

2066
02:59:50,360 --> 02:59:55,880
Horses and cattle both were being missed, and each man began
almost to doubt his neighbor.

2067
02:59:55,880 --> 03:00:00,360
“Steps will have to be taken soon by somebody, I reckon,” said
the lover.

2068
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:03,200
“By you?” she asked quickly.

2069
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:05,600
“Most likely I’ll get mixed up with it.”

2070
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:07,000
“What will you have to do?”

2071
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:10,640
“Can’t say. I’ll tell yu’ when I come back.”

2072
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:15,240
So did he part from her, leaving her more kisses than words to
remember.

2073
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:19,520
And what was doing at Bennington, meanwhile, and at Dunbarton?


2074
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:27,440
Those three letters which by their mere outside had so moved Mrs.
Taylor, produced by their contents much painful disturbance.

2075
03:00:27,440 --> 03:00:31,840
It will be remembered that Molly wrote to her mother, and to
her great-aunt.

2076
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:35,480
That announcement to her mother was undertaken first.

2077
03:00:35,480 --> 03:00:43,720
Its composition occupied three hours and a half, and it filled
eleven pages, not counting a postscript upon the twelfth.

2078
03:00:43,720 --> 03:00:46,560
The letter to the great-aunt took only ten minutes.

2079
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:53,200
I cannot pretend to explain why this one was so greatly superior
to the other; but such is the remarkable fact.

2080
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:59,000
Its beginning, to be sure, did give the old lady a start; she
had dismissed the cowboy from her probabilities.

2081
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:02,240
“Tut, tut, tut!” she exclaimed out loud in her bedroom.

2082
03:01:02,240 --> 03:01:04,960
“She has thrown herself away on that fellow!”

2083
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:10,840
But some sentences at the end made her pause and sit still for
a long while.

2084
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:16,800
The severity upon her face changed to tenderness, gradually.

2085
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:20,800
“Ah, me,” she sighed.

2086
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:23,480
“If marriage were as simple as love!”

2087
03:01:23,480 --> 03:01:29,120
Then she went slowly downstairs, and out into her garden, where
she walked long between the box borders.

2088
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:32,440
“But if she has found a great love,” said the old lady at length.


2089
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:37,840
And she returned to her bedroom, and opened an old desk, and
read some old letters.

2090
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:42,000
There came to her the next morning a communication from Bennington.


2091
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:45,720
This had been penned frantically by poor Mrs. Wood.

2092
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:56,000
As soon as she had been able to gather her senses after the shock of her daughter’s eleven pages and
the postscript, the mother had poured out eight pages herself to the eldest member of the family.

2093
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:59,160
There had been, indeed, much excuse for the poor lady.

2094
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:08,680
To begin with, Molly had constructed her whole opening page with
the express and merciful intention of preparing her mother.

2095
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:11,440
Consequently, it made no sense whatever.

2096
03:02:11,440 --> 03:02:16,160
Its effect was the usual effect of remarks designed to break
a thing gently.

2097
03:02:16,160 --> 03:02:21,280
It merely made Mrs. Wood’s head swim, and filled her with a sickening
dread.

2098
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:25,640
“Oh, mercy, Sarah,” she had cried, “come here.

2099
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:27,640
What does this mean?”

2100
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:34,840
And then, fortified by her elder daughter, she had turned over
that first page and found what it meant on the top of the second.

2101
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:38,440
“A savage with knives and pistols!” she wailed.

2102
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:42,360
“Well, mother, I always told you so,” said her daughter Sarah.


2103
03:02:42,360 --> 03:02:45,160
“What is a foreman?” exclaimed the mother.

2104
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:46,880
“And who is Judge Henry?”

2105
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:50,040
“She has taken a sort of upper servant,” said Sarah.

2106
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:55,880
“If it is allowed to go as far as a wedding, I doubt if I can
bring myself to be present.”

2107
03:02:55,880 --> 03:03:02,200
(This threat she proceeded to make to Molly, with results that
shall be set forth in their proper place.

2108
03:03:02,200 --> 03:03:02,600
)

2109
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:06,640
“The man appears to have written to me himself,” said Mrs. Wood.


2110
03:03:06,640 --> 03:03:09,200
“He knows no better,” said Sarah.

2111
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:11,960
“Bosh!” said Sarah’s husband later.

2112
03:03:11,960 --> 03:03:14,680
“It was a very manly thing to do.”

2113
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:17,960
Thus did consternation rage in the house at Bennington.

2114
03:03:17,960 --> 03:03:29,160
Molly might have spared herself the many assurances that she gave concerning the
universal esteem in which her cowpuncher was held, and the fair prospects which were his.

2115
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:38,040
So, in the first throes of her despair, Mrs. Wood wrote those
eight not maturely considered pages to the great-aunt.

2116
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:41,680
“Tut, tut, tut!” said the great-aunt as she read them.

2117
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:44,120
Her face was much more severe today.

2118
03:03:44,120 --> 03:03:49,920
“You’d suppose,” she said, “that the girl had been kidnapped!


2119
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:53,920
Why, she has kept him waiting three years!”

2120
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:57,480
And then she read more, but soon put the letter down with laughter.


2121
03:03:57,480 --> 03:04:04,160
For Mrs. Wood had repeated in writing that early outburst of
hers about a savage with knives and pistols.

2122
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:06,800
“Law!” said the great-aunt.

2123
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:09,320
“Law, what a fool Lizzie is!”

2124
03:04:09,320 --> 03:04:29,440
So she sat down and wrote to Mrs. Wood a wholesome reply about putting a little more trust in her own flesh and blood, and reminding her among other things that General Stark
had himself been wont to carry knives and pistols owing to the necessities of his career, but that he had occasionally taken them off, as did probably this young man in Wyoming.

2125
03:04:29,440 --> 03:04:33,640
“You had better send me the letter he has written you,” she concluded.


2126
03:04:33,640 --> 03:04:37,400
“I shall know much better what to think after I have seen that.”


2127
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:44,960
It is not probable that Mrs. Wood got much comfort from this
communication; and her daughter Sarah was actually enraged by it.

2128
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:51,720
“She grows more perverse as she nears her dotage,” said Sarah.


2129
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:59,680
But the Virginian’s letter was sent to Dunbarton, where the old
lady sat herself down to read it with much attention.

2130
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:04,160
Here is what the Virginian had said to the unknown mother of
his sweetheart.

2131
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:05,360
Mrs. John Stark Wood,

2132
03:05:05,360 --> 03:05:07,520
Bennington, Vermont.

2133
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:09,160
Madam:

2134
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:18,000
If your daughter Miss Wood has ever told you about her saving a man’s life
here when some Indians had shot him that is the man who writes to you now.

2135
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:24,520
I don’t think she can have told you right about that affair for she
is the only one in this country who thinks it was a little thing.

2136
03:05:24,520 --> 03:05:26,840
So I must tell you it, the main points.

2137
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:34,440
Such an action would have been thought highly of in a Western
girl, but with Miss Wood’s raising nobody had a right to expect it.

2138
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:37,520
“Indeed!” snorted the great-aunt.

2139
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:44,400
“Well, he would be right, if I had not had a good deal more to
do with her ‘raising’ than ever Lizzie had.”

2140
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:45,760
And she went on with the letter.

2141
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:48,720
I was starting in to die when she found me.

2142
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:55,160
I did not know anything then, and she pulled me back from where
I was half in the next world.

2143
03:05:55,160 --> 03:06:00,960
She did not know but what Indians would get her too but I could
not make her leave me.

2144
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:06,000
I am a heavy man one hundred and seventy-three stripped when
in full health.

2145
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:12,360
She lifted me herself from the ground me helping scarce any for
there was not much help in me that day.

2146
03:06:12,360 --> 03:06:16,360
She washed my wound and brought me to with her own whiskey.

2147
03:06:16,360 --> 03:06:26,960
Before she could get me home I was out of my head but she kept me on my horse somehow and
talked wisely to me so I minded her and did not go clean crazy till she had got me safe to bed.

2148
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:32,480
The doctor says I would have died all the same if she had not
nursed me the way she did.

2149
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:35,760
It made me love her more which I did not know I could.

2150
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:41,640
But there is no end, for this writing it down makes me love her
more as I write it.

2151
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:47,280
And now Mrs. Wood I am sorry this will be bad news for you to
hear.

2152
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:54,720
I know you would never choose such a man as I am for her for I
have got no education and must write humble against my birth.

2153
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:58,960
I wish I could make the news easier but truth is the best.

2154
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:01,280
I am of old stock in Virginia.

2155
03:07:01,280 --> 03:07:07,560
English and one Scotch Irish grandmother my father’s father brought
from Kentucky.

2156
03:07:07,560 --> 03:07:22,760
We have always stayed at the same place farmers and hunters not
bettering our lot and very plain.

2157
03:07:22,760 --> 03:07:31,720
We have fought when we got the chance, under Old Hickory and in Mexico
and my father and two brothers were killed in the Valley sixty-four.

2158
03:07:31,720 --> 03:07:37,040
Always with us one son has been apt to run away and I was the
one this time.

2159
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:40,000
I had too much older brothering to suit me.

2160
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:52,160
But now I am doing well being in full sight of prosperity and not too old
and very strong my health having stood the sundries it has been put through.

2161
03:07:52,160 --> 03:07:54,480
She shall teach school no more when she is mine.

2162
03:07:54,480 --> 03:07:58,680
I wish I could make this news easier for you Mrs. Wood.

2163
03:07:58,680 --> 03:08:00,760
I do not like promises I have heard so many.

2164
03:08:00,760 --> 03:08:05,880
I will tell any man of your family anything he likes to ask one,
and Judge Henry would tell you about my reputation.

2165
03:08:05,880 --> 03:08:12,320
I have seen plenty rough things but can say I have never killed for
pleasure or profit and am not one of that kind, always preferring peace.

2166
03:08:12,320 --> 03:08:21,680
I have had to live in places where they had courts and lawyers so called
but an honest man was all the law you could find in five hundred miles.

2167
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:29,080
I have not told her about those things not because I am ashamed of them
but there are so many things too dark for a girl like her to hear about.

2168
03:08:29,080 --> 03:08:31,040
I had better tell you the way I know I love Miss Wood.

2169
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:33,160
I am not a boy now, and women are no new thing to me.

2170
03:08:33,160 --> 03:08:40,160
A man like me who has travelled meets many of them as he goes
and passes on but I stopped when I came to Miss Wood.

2171
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:43,960
That is three years but I have not gone on.

2172
03:08:43,960 --> 03:08:47,800
What right has such as he? you will say.

2173
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:51,040
So did I say it after she had saved my life.

2174
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:56,640
It was hard to get to that point and keep there with her around
me all day.

2175
03:08:56,640 --> 03:09:09,000
But I said to myself you have bothered her for three years with your love and if you let your love
bother her you don’t love her like you should and you must quit for her sake who has saved your life.

2176
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:20,320
I did not know what I was going to do with my life after that but I supposed I
could go somewhere and work hard and so Mrs. Wood I told her I would give her up.

2177
03:09:20,320 --> 03:09:21,960
But she said no.

2178
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:25,160
It is going to be hard for her to get used to a man like me⁠—


2179
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:29,840
But at this point in the Virginian’s letter, the old great-aunt
could read no more.

2180
03:09:29,840 --> 03:09:34,440
She rose, and went over to that desk where lay those faded letters
of her own.

2181
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:41,920
She laid her head down upon the package, and as her tears flowed
quietly upon it, “O dear,” she whispered, “O dear!

2182
03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:44,720
And this is what I lost!”

2183
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:47,680
To her girl upon Bear Creek she wrote the next day.

2184
03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:52,600
And this word from Dunbarton was like balm among the harsh stings
Molly was receiving.

2185
03:09:52,600 --> 03:09:57,000
The voices of the world reached her in gathering numbers, and
not one of them save that great-aunt’s was sweet.

2186
03:09:57,000 --> 03:10:03,640
Her days were full of hurts; and there was no one by to kiss
the hurts away.

2187
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:06,520
Nor did she even hear from her lover any more now.

2188
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:09,760
She only knew he had gone into lonely regions upon his errand.


2189
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:11,720
That errand took him far:⁠—

2190
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:26,440
Across the Basin, among the secret places of Owl Creek, past the Washakie Needles, over the
Divide to Gros Ventre, and so through a final barrier of peaks into the borders of East Idaho.

2191
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:33,720
There, by reason of his bidding me, I met him, and came to share
in a part of his errand.

2192
03:10:33,720 --> 03:10:35,800
It was with no guide that I travelled to him.

2193
03:10:35,800 --> 03:10:41,280
He had named a little station on the railroad, and from thence
he had charted my route by means of landmarks.

2194
03:10:41,280 --> 03:10:46,600
Did I believe in omens, the black storm that I set out in upon
my horse

2195
03:10:46,600 --> 03:10:48,120
would seem like one today.

2196
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:53,840
But I had been living in cities and smoke; and Idaho, even with
rain, was delightful to me.

2197
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:55,520
CHAPTER XXX

2198
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:56,120
A

2199
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:57,000
Stable on the Flat

2200
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:12,120
When the first landmark, the lone clump of cottonwoods, came at length in sight, dark and blurred in the gentle
rain, standing out perhaps a mile beyond the distant buildings, my whole weary body hailed the approach of repose.

2201
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:18,640
Saving the noon hour, I had been in the saddle since six, and
now six was come round again.

2202
03:11:18,640 --> 03:11:24,240
The ranch, my resting-place for this night, was a ruin⁠—cabin,
stable, and corral.

2203
03:11:24,240 --> 03:11:35,920
Yet after the twelve hours of pushing on and on through silence, still to have silence,
still to eat and go to sleep in it, perfectly fitted the mood of both my flesh and spirit.

2204
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:46,160
At noon, when for a while I had thrown off my long oilskin coat, merely the sight of the newspaper
half crowded into my pocket had been a displeasing reminder of the railway, and cities, and affairs.

2205
03:11:46,160 --> 03:11:50,280
But for its possible help to build fires, it would have come
no farther with me.

2206
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:54,880
The great levels around me lay cooled and freed of dust by the
wet weather, and full of sweet airs.

2207
03:11:54,880 --> 03:11:58,240
Far in front the foothills rose through the rain, indefinite
and mystic.

2208
03:11:58,240 --> 03:12:02,920
I wanted no speech with anyone, nor to be near human beings at
all.

2209
03:12:02,920 --> 03:12:07,600
I was steeped in a revery as of the primal earth; even thoughts
themselves had almost ceased motion.

2210
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:23,360
To lie down with wild animals, with elk and deer, would have made my waking dream complete; and since such dream could not be,
the cattle around the deserted buildings, mere dots as yet across separating space, were my proper companions for this evening.

2211
03:12:23,360 --> 03:12:28,000
Tomorrow night I should probably be camping with the Virginian
in the foothills.

2212
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:36,120
At his letter’s bidding I had come eastward across Idaho, abandoning my hunting
in the Saw Tooth Range to make this journey with him back through the Tetons.

2213
03:12:36,120 --> 03:12:39,000
It was a trail known to him, and not to many other honest men.


2214
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,920
Horse Thief Pass was the name his letter gave it.

2215
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:45,360
Business (he was always brief) would call him over there at this
time.

2216
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:48,640
Returning, he must attend to certain matters in the Wind River
country.

2217
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:52,240
There I could leave by stage for the railroad, or go on with
him the whole way back to Sunk Creek.

2218
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:58,560
He designated for our meeting the forks of a certain little
stream in the foothills which today’s ride had brought in sight.

2219
03:12:58,560 --> 03:13:03,720
There would be no chance for him to receive an answer from me
in the intervening time.

2220
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:11,240
If by a certain day⁠—which was four days off still⁠—I had not
reached the forks, he would understand I had other plans.

2221
03:13:11,240 --> 03:13:25,000
To me it was like living back in ages gone, this way of meeting my friend, this choice
of a stream so far and lonely that its very course upon the maps was wrongly traced.

2222
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:38,920
And to leave behind all noise and mechanisms, and set out at ease, slowly, with one packhorse, into the wilderness, made me feel
that the ancient earth was indeed my mother and that I had found her again after being lost among houses, customs, and restraints.

2223
03:13:38,920 --> 03:13:46,240
I should arrive three days early at the forks⁠—three days of
margin seeming to me a wise precaution against delays unforeseen.

2224
03:13:46,240 --> 03:13:50,080
If the Virginian were not there, good; I could fish and be happy.


2225
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:55,400
If he were there but not ready to start, good; I could still
fish and be happy.

2226
03:13:55,400 --> 03:14:04,400
And remembering my Eastern helplessness in the year when we
had met first, I enjoyed thinking how I had come to be trusted.

2227
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:16,920
In those days I had not been allowed to go from the ranch for so much as an afternoon’s ride
unless tied to him by a string, so to speak; now I was crossing unmapped spaces with no guidance.

2228
03:14:16,920 --> 03:14:21,640
The man who could do this was scarce any longer a “tenderfoot.”


2229
03:14:21,640 --> 03:14:33,920
My vision, as I rode, took in serenely the dim foothills⁠—tomorrow’s goal⁠—and nearer in the vast wet
plain the clump of cottonwoods, and still nearer my lodging for tonight with the dotted cattle round it.

2230
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:35,320
And now my horse neighed.

2231
03:14:35,320 --> 03:14:45,880
I felt his gait freshen for the journey’s end, and leaning to pat his neck I noticed his ears no
longer slack and inattentive, but pointing forward to where food and rest awaited both of us.

2232
03:14:45,880 --> 03:15:00,520
Twice he neighed, impatiently and long; and as he quickened his gait still more, the packhorse did the same, and
I realized that there was about me still a spice of the tenderfoot: those dots were not cattle; they were horses.

2233
03:15:00,520 --> 03:15:02,880
My horse had put me in the wrong.

2234
03:15:02,880 --> 03:15:07,280
He had known his kind from afar, and was hastening to them.

2235
03:15:07,280 --> 03:15:10,760
The plainsman’s eye was not yet mine; and I smiled a little as
I rode.

2236
03:15:10,760 --> 03:15:17,080
When was I going to know, as by instinct, the different look
of horses and cattle across some two or three miles of plain?

2237
03:15:17,080 --> 03:15:19,440
These miles we finished soon.

2238
03:15:19,440 --> 03:15:28,000
The buildings changed in their aspect as they grew to my approach, showing their
desolation more clearly, and in some way bringing apprehension into my mood.

2239
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:34,360
And around them the horses, too, all standing with ears erect, watching
me as I came⁠—there was something about them; or was it the silence?

2240
03:15:34,360 --> 03:15:40,960
For the silence which I had liked until now seemed suddenly to
be made too great by the presence of the deserted buildings.

2241
03:15:40,960 --> 03:15:48,720
And then the door of the stable opened, and men came out and
stood, also watching me arrive.

2242
03:15:48,720 --> 03:15:51,800
By the time I was dismounting more were there.

2243
03:15:51,800 --> 03:15:59,240
It was senseless to feel as unpleasant as I did, and I strove
to give to them a greeting that should sound easy.

2244
03:15:59,240 --> 03:16:04,200
I told them that I hoped there was room for one more here tonight.


2245
03:16:04,200 --> 03:16:15,000
Some of them had answered my greeting, but none of them answered this; and as I
began to be sure that I recognized several of their strangely imperturbable faces

2246
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:19,000
, the Virginian came from the stable; and at that welcome sight
my relief spoke out instantly.

2247
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:20,760
“I am here, you see!”

2248
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:22,280
“Yes, I do see.”

2249
03:16:22,280 --> 03:16:25,760
I looked hard at him, for in his voice was the same strangeness
that I felt in everything around me.

2250
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:28,040
But he was looking at his companions.

2251
03:16:28,040 --> 03:16:31,080
“This gentleman is all right,” he told them.

2252
03:16:31,080 --> 03:16:34,480
“That may be,” said one whom I now knew that I had seen before
at Sunk Creek

2253
03:16:34,480 --> 03:16:36,880
; “but he was not due tonight.”

2254
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:38,400
“Nor tomorrow,” said another.

2255
03:16:38,400 --> 03:16:39,800
“Nor yet the day after,” a third added.

2256
03:16:39,800 --> 03:16:41,360
The Virginian fell into his drawl.

2257
03:16:41,360 --> 03:16:44,040
“None of you was ever early for anything, I presume.”

2258
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:50,200
One retorted, laughing, “Oh, we’re not suspicioning you of complicity.”


2259
03:16:50,200 --> 03:16:54,080
And another, “Not even when we remember how thick you and Steve
used to be.”

2260
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:56,200
Whatever jokes they meant by this he did not receive as jokes.


2261
03:16:56,200 --> 03:16:59,920
I saw something like a wince pass over his face, and a flush
follow it.

2262
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:03,040
But he now spoke to me.

2263
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:07,360
“We expected to be through before this,” he began.

2264
03:17:07,360 --> 03:17:11,480
“I’m right sorry you have come tonight. I know you’d have preferred
to keep away.”

2265
03:17:11,480 --> 03:17:14,920
“We want him to explain himself,” put in one of the others.

2266
03:17:14,920 --> 03:17:16,880
“If he satisfies us, he’s free to go away.”

2267
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:18,120
“Free to go away!” I now exclaimed.

2268
03:17:18,120 --> 03:17:22,280
But at the indulgence in their frontier smile I cooled down.

2269
03:17:22,280 --> 03:17:29,240
“Gentlemen,” I said, “I don’t know why my movements interest
you so much.

2270
03:17:29,240 --> 03:17:30,760
It’s quite a compliment!

2271
03:17:30,760 --> 03:17:33,480
May I get under shelter while I explain?”

2272
03:17:33,480 --> 03:17:36,520
No request could have been more natural, for the rain had now
begun to fall in straight floods.

2273
03:17:36,520 --> 03:17:42,240
Yet there was a pause before one of them said, “He might as well.”


2274
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:48,400
The Virginian chose to say nothing more; but he walked beside
me into the stable.

2275
03:17:48,400 --> 03:17:52,400
Two men sat there together, and a third guarded them.

2276
03:17:52,400 --> 03:18:00,600
At that sight I knew suddenly what I had stumbled upon; and on the
impulse I murmured to the Virginian, “You’re hanging them tomorrow.”

2277
03:18:00,600 --> 03:18:01,720
He kept his silence.

2278
03:18:01,720 --> 03:18:05,240
“You may have three guesses,” said a man behind me.

2279
03:18:05,240 --> 03:18:06,160
But I did not need them.

2280
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:12,480
And in the recoil of my insight the clump of cottonwoods came
into my mind, black and grim.

2281
03:18:12,480 --> 03:18:15,360
No other trees high enough grew within ten miles.

2282
03:18:15,360 --> 03:18:19,080
This, then, was the business that the Virginian’s letter had
so curtly mentioned.

2283
03:18:19,080 --> 03:18:23,240
My eyes went into all corners of the stable, but no other prisoners
were here.

2284
03:18:23,240 --> 03:18:35,360
I half expected to see Trampas, and I half feared to see Shorty; for poor stupid Shorty’s honesty had
not been proof against frontier temptations, and he had fallen away from the company of his old friends.

2285
03:18:35,360 --> 03:18:46,840
Often of late I had heard talk at Sunk Creek of breaking up a certain gang of horse and cattle thieves
that stole in one Territory and sold in the next, and knew where to hide in the mountains between.

2286
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:57,040
And now it had come to the point; forces had been gathered, a long expedition made, and here
they were, successful under the Virginian’s lead, but a little later than their calculations.

2287
03:18:57,040 --> 03:19:01,000
And here was I, a little too early, and a witness in consequence.


2288
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:11,000
My presence seemed a simple thing to account for; but when I
had thus accounted for it, one of them said with good nature:⁠—

2289
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:16,840
“So you find us here, and we find you here. Which is the most
surprised, I wonder?”

2290
03:19:16,840 --> 03:19:23,880
“There’s no telling,” said I, keeping as amiable as I could;
“nor any telling which objects the most.”

2291
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:25,120
“Oh, there’s no objection here.

2292
03:19:25,120 --> 03:19:26,040
You’re welcome to stay.

2293
03:19:26,040 --> 03:19:27,280
But not welcome to go, I expect.

2294
03:19:27,280 --> 03:19:28,880
He ain’t welcome to go, is he?”

2295
03:19:28,880 --> 03:19:31,120
By the answers that their faces gave him it was plain that I
was not.

2296
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:33,560
“Not till we are through,” said one.

2297
03:19:33,560 --> 03:19:34,880
“He needn’t to see anything,” ’ another added.

2298
03:19:34,880 --> 03:19:37,000
“Better sleep late tomorrow morning,” a third suggested to me.


2299
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:38,560
I did not wish to stay here.

2300
03:19:38,560 --> 03:19:45,560
I could have made some sort of camp apart from them before
dark; but in the face of their needless caution I was helpless.

2301
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:58,240
I made no attempt to inquire what kind of spy they imagined I could be, what sort of rescue I
could bring in this lonely country; my too early appearance seemed to be all that they looked at.

2302
03:19:58,240 --> 03:20:00,160
And again my eyes sought the prisoners.

2303
03:20:00,160 --> 03:20:02,800
Certainly there were only two.

2304
03:20:02,800 --> 03:20:12,320
One was chewing tobacco, and talking now and then to his guard
as if nothing were the matter.

2305
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:19,960
The other sat dull in silence, not moving his eyes; but his face
worked, and I noticed how he continually moistened his dry lips.

2306
03:20:19,960 --> 03:20:27,760
As I looked at these doomed prisoners, whose fate I was invited to sleep
through tomorrow morning, the one who was chewing quietly nodded to me.

2307
03:20:27,760 --> 03:20:29,560
“You don’t remember me?” he said.

2308
03:20:29,560 --> 03:20:30,560
It was Steve!

2309
03:20:30,560 --> 03:20:31,520
Steve of Medicine Bow!

2310
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:35,160
The pleasant Steve of my first evening in the West.

2311
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:38,120
Some change of beard had delayed my instant recognition of his
face.

2312
03:20:38,120 --> 03:20:40,440
Here he sat sentenced to die.

2313
03:20:40,440 --> 03:20:44,000
A shock, chill and painful, deprived me of speech.

2314
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:45,760
He had no such weak feelings.

2315
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:48,240
“Have yu’ been to Medicine Bow lately?” he inquired.

2316
03:20:48,240 --> 03:20:50,560
“That’s getting to be quite a while ago.”

2317
03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:51,440
I assented.

2318
03:20:51,440 --> 03:21:01,720
I should have liked to say something natural and kind, but words stuck against my will, and I stood
awkward and ill at ease, noticing idly that the silent one wore a gray flannel shirt like mine.

2319
03:21:01,720 --> 03:21:08,480
Steve looked me over, and saw in my pocket the newspaper which I had
brought from the railroad and on which I had pencilled a few expenses.

2320
03:21:08,480 --> 03:21:12,280
He asked me, Would I mind letting him have it for a while?

2321
03:21:12,280 --> 03:21:15,280
And I gave it to him eagerly, begging him to keep it as long
as he wanted.

2322
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:16,600
I was overeager in my embarrassment.

2323
03:21:16,600 --> 03:21:20,000
“You need not return it at all,” I said; “those notes are nothing.


2324
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:20,840
Do keep it.”

2325
03:21:20,840 --> 03:21:23,800
He gave me a short glance and a smile.

2326
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:26,480
“Thank you,” he said; “I’ll not need it beyond tomorrow morning.”


2327
03:21:26,480 --> 03:21:27,960
And he began to search through it.

2328
03:21:27,960 --> 03:21:33,360
“Jake’s election is considered sure,” he said to his companion,
who made no response.

2329
03:21:33,360 --> 03:21:36,600
“Well, Fremont County owes it to Jake.”

2330
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:38,640
And I left him interested in the local news.

2331
03:21:38,640 --> 03:21:51,400
Dead men I have seen not a few times, even some lying pale and terrible after violent ends, and the edge
of this wears off; but I hope I shall never again have to be in the company with men waiting to be killed.

2332
03:21:51,400 --> 03:21:57,120
By this time tomorrow the gray flannel shirt would be buttoned
round a corpse.

2333
03:21:57,120 --> 03:22:01,120
Until what moment would Steve chew?

2334
03:22:01,120 --> 03:22:11,120
Against such fancies as these I managed presently to barricade my mind, but I made a
plea to be allowed to pass the night elsewhere, and I suggested the adjacent cabin.

2335
03:22:11,120 --> 03:22:14,880
By their faces I saw that my words merely helped their distrust
of me.

2336
03:22:14,880 --> 03:22:18,680
The cabin leaked too much, they said; I would sleep drier here.


2337
03:22:18,680 --> 03:22:23,480
One man gave it to me more directly: “If you figured on camping
in this stable, what has changed your mind?”

2338
03:22:23,480 --> 03:22:29,680
How could I tell them that I shrunk from any contact with what they were
doing, although I knew that only so could justice be dealt in this country?

2339
03:22:29,680 --> 03:22:35,360
Their wholesome frontier nerves knew nothing of such refinements.


2340
03:22:35,360 --> 03:22:36,840
But the Virginian understood part of it.

2341
03:22:36,840 --> 03:22:40,000
“I am right sorry for your annoyance,” he said.

2342
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:43,960
And now I noticed he was under a constraint very different from
the ease of the others.

2343
03:22:43,960 --> 03:22:46,320
After the twelve hours’ ride my bones were hungry for rest.

2344
03:22:46,320 --> 03:22:54,720
I spread my blankets on some straw in a stall by myself and rolled up in them; yet I
lay growing broader awake, every inch of weariness stricken from my excited senses.

2345
03:22:54,720 --> 03:23:04,840
For a while they sat over their councils, whispering cautiously, so that I was made curious to hear them by
not being able; was it the names of Trampas and Shorty that were once or twice spoken⁠—I could not be sure.

2346
03:23:04,840 --> 03:23:07,720
I heard the whisperers cease and separate.

2347
03:23:07,720 --> 03:23:09,720
I heard their boots as they cast them off upon the ground.

2348
03:23:09,720 --> 03:23:13,600
And I heard the breathing of slumber begin and grow in the interior
silence.

2349
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:15,680
To one after one sleep came, but not to me.

2350
03:23:15,680 --> 03:23:22,520
Outside, the dull fall of the rain beat evenly, and in some angle
dripped the spouting pulses of a leak.

2351
03:23:22,520 --> 03:23:26,840
Sometimes a cold air blew in, bearing with it the keen wet odor
of the sagebrush.

2352
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:35,680
On hundreds of other nights this perfume had been my last waking remembrance;
it had seemed to help drowsiness; and now I lay staring, thinking of this.

2353
03:23:35,680 --> 03:23:41,320
Twice through the hours the thieves shifted their positions with
clumsy sounds, exchanging muted words with their guard.

2354
03:23:41,320 --> 03:23:47,120
So, often, had I heard other companions move and mutter in the
darkness and lie down again.

2355
03:23:47,120 --> 03:24:05,640
It was the very naturalness and usualness of every fact of the night⁠—the stable straw, the rain outside, my familiar blankets, the cool visits of the
wind⁠—and with all this the thought of Steve chewing and the man in the gray flannel shirt, that made the hours unearthly and strung me tight with suspense.

2356
03:24:05,640 --> 03:24:09,400
And at last I heard someone get up and begin to dress.

2357
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:17,840
In a little while I saw light suddenly through my closed eyelids,
and then darkness shut again abruptly upon them.

2358
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:23,640
They had swung in a lantern and found me by mistake.

2359
03:24:23,640 --> 03:24:25,400
I was the only one they did not wish to rouse.

2360
03:24:25,400 --> 03:24:31,640
Moving and quiet talking set up around me, and they began to
go out of the stable.

2361
03:24:31,640 --> 03:24:39,920
At the gleams of new daylight which they let in my thoughts went to the clump
of cottonwoods, and I lay still with hands and feet growing steadily cold.

2362
03:24:39,920 --> 03:24:40,920
Now it was going to happen.

2363
03:24:40,920 --> 03:24:51,840
I wondered how they would do it; one instance had been described to me by a
witness, but that was done from a bridge, and there had been but a single victim.

2364
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:55,720
This morning, would one have to wait and see the other go through
with it first?

2365
03:24:55,720 --> 03:25:02,080
The smell of smoke reached me, and next the rattle of tin dishes.
