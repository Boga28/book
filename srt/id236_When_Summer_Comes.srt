00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,700
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:08,570
The city heat

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:16,400
'When we get to Polreath on Saturday, I'm
going to do nothing,' said Anna.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,470
'I just want to sit and have cool drinks and
read and watch the world go by.'

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,100
'Me too,' replied Stephen.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,580
It was the hottest summer for twenty years.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,960
It had started at the end of May.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,579
Everyone thought the heat would only last
for a few days and then the rain would return,

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,590
but this summer was different.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,730
'And don't expect any intelligent conversation
from me,' Anna continued.

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,670
'It'll take a day or two for me to become
a member of the human race again!'

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,470
'Mm,' said Stephen, not really listening.

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,390
'What about this cottage we've booked, do
you think it's going to be all right?

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,280
To be honest, I'm a bit worried about it - we
were so late making our decision and it was

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,080
still available.

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,159
Why didn't anyone else want it?

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,500
It makes me think there must be something
wrong with it.'

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,390
'Don't worry.

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm sure it'll be fine.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,790
And even if it's not, we'll still be away
from here.

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,240
Just think - three weeks by the sea, without
any work.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,390
It sounds wonderful.'

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,990
In the city, the heat was uncomfortable.

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,470
People were not used to high temperatures
day after day.

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,780
Journeys to work became hot and sweaty, and
increasingly bad-tempered in the crowded trains

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,850
and buses.

27
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,320
By the beginning of July, nobody could remember
when it had last rained.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,009
Everywhere you looked seemed to be brown - the
grass in the parks was burnt and most of the

29
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,310
flowers had died.

30
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,469
The sun was burning hot and the air seemed
to be getting thicker and thicker.

31
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,170
At the weekends, the place was empty as many
people left for the countryside.

32
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,220
But Stephen and Anna couldn't leave - not
until the weekend anyway.

33
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,700
Stephen was thirty-two with dark, curly hair.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,030
He had noticed a few grey hairs that morning
when he was drying it after his shower.

35
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,970
But he didn't mind too much; in fact, he rather
liked the idea of a few which might make him

36
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,810
look serious.

37
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,379
But his face showed signs of stress and worry.

38
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,519
Stephen left the flat just before seven.

39
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,840
He was earlier than usual this morning because
he wanted to avoid the rush hour, but it seemed

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,450
as if everyone else had had the same idea
- the roads were busy and there had been an

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,500
accident half way along Sussex Gardens.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,830
He waited impatiently while the police sorted
out the chaos but by the time he arrived at

43
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,870
work, he was late and not in a very good mood.

44
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,390
He locked the Saab and went into the cool
building.

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,810
The offices of Jardine and Makepeace, advertising
agents, were on the fourteenth floor of a

46
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,670
modern block with wonderful views over Regent's
Park.

47
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,140
But this morning, when Stephen found himself
climbing the stairs (the lift was out of order

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:36,000
again!), he would happily have given up the
views for an office on the ground floor.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,920
'Please let everything go smoothly today,'
he said to himself as he made his way up the

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,470
stairs.

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,640
Stephen was worried about work - the agency
had lost an important client that week.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,989
He felt that Charlie Jardine, the agency boss,
blamed him.

53
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,220
A couple of days before, he'd passed by Charlie's
office and had heard him saying on the phone,

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,069
'Yes, well, I'll have to talk to Stephen about
that.

55
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,930
He was the one working on their new advertisement.'

56
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:15,140
Stephen hadn't heard any more but he thought
that Charlie sounded a bit angry.

57
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,280
He wondered if it was a bad time to go on
holiday - perhaps his job would disappear

58
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,490
when he was away.

59
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,330
But he didn't want to miss this break - and
in any case, Anna would kill him if he suggested

60
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,000
cancelling.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
So he said nothing to her about his worries.

62
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,260
He often found it hard to talk about his problems,
even with Anna.

63
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,039
God knows why, she was usually willing to
listen.

64
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:48,560
In his mind, he would think through different
ways of opening the conversation with her,

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,590
but everything he thought of sounded so obvious
- 'I'm worried about work' or 'I'd like to

66
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,100
talk to you about something'.

67
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,770
In any case, he really preferred to work things
out himself.

68
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,580
But he knew he was not easy to live with when
he didn't talk much.

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,850
'Morning Mark.

70
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,800
Another lovely day,' panted Stephen, and sat
down to get his breath back.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,259
His shirt was wet and sticking to his back.

72
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,740
'Morning Stephen,' said Mark.

73
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,729
'I'm not sure if it is a lovely day.

74
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:30,220
Clare's away - she's got food poisoning or
something - so between us we've got to do

75
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,449
her work as well as our own.'

76
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,120
'Oh hell!

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,860
Just what I needed to hear!' replied Stephen.

78
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,000
Anna's last day began even earlier.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,639
At 6.30 that morning, she yawned as she walked
across to St Phillips Hospital.

80
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,919
It was another beautiful morning - for her
the best time of the day when the air was

81
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,650
still fresh and the day was still full of
promise.

82
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,100
Her nurse's cap sat comfortably on her short
blond hair.

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,620
She looked fresh and efficient in her blue
uniform.

84
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,639
She loved her job as a nurse but it was hard.

85
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,910
There always seemed to be so much to do - more
than ever since the new manager had arrived.

86
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,920
'This weekend, when we're away,' she thought,
'I'm going to get up early and walk along

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,790
the beach before anyone else is awake.'

88
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,660
Then she laughed at the idea of getting up
early when she didn't have to!

89
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,560
Well, maybe she would - who knows, holidays
can change people.

90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
Maybe that's what she needed - change.

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,689
She was thirty and had been working at St
Phillips since she'd finished her training

92
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,090
- perhaps it was time to move on.

93
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,250
Later in the day, she went to say goodbye
to Michael Barton, a favourite patient who

94
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,639
was recovering from a major operation.

95
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,310
'Have a wonderful holiday!' he said.

96
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,879
'Thanks, I will.

97
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,500
And I hope I won't see you when I get back,'
replied Anna.

98
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,680
And as soon as she said it, she realised what
a stupid thing it was to say.

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,200
'I mean, I hope you won't still be in hospital,
you know, you'll be back at home,' she said

100
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
quickly.

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,990
'It's all right, love.

102
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,370
I know you weren't talking about me dying!

103
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,889
I hope I don't see you either - although I'll
miss you looking after me.

104
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,550
Bye - all the best.'

105
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,960
She left the ward knowing that this time tomorrow
she would be in a different world.

106
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,940
She got off the hospital bus at the end of
her street and walked slowly home, thinking

107
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,270
about a cool beer in the back garden.

108
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,710
They were lucky.

109
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:55,350
Their flat was on the ground floor of a nineteenth-century
house and the garden at the back was theirs.

110
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,330
The garden wasn't big but it was a wonderful
place to escape to in the summer.

111
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,820
She wondered what sort of day Stephen had
had.

112
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,990
She knew something was worrying him but was
too tired to do anything about it.

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,289
Anyway, she knew from past experience that
it was no use asking directly.

114
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:20,780
He'd once told her that he could only talk
about difficult things after they were past

115
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,539
and no longer difficult.

116
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:26,729
'I'll find out what it is on holiday,' she
thought.

117
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,500
'When we've got more time and energy.'

118
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,470
As Stephen was about to leave the office that
evening, Charlie Jardine called him into his

119
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,410
office and told him that there were going
to be some changes in the next month, that

120
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,870
probably one member of staff would have to
go - 'be made redundant' was how Charlie said

121
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:55,740
it, but Stephen thought 'sacked... fired...
dismissed' was what he really wanted to say.

122
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,460
Then Charlie said, 'But of course, I don't
want to lose you.'

123
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,019
Why didn't that make Stephen feel better?

124
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:13,589
He left work with a heavy heart.

125
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,200
CHAPTER TWO

126
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
On the way

127
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,560
'Got everything?'

128
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
asked Anna.

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,590
'I don't care if we haven't!' said Stephen.

130
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,870
'Let's go!

131
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,420
You drive.'

132
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,589
'OK.

133
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,560
We've got to stop at Rebecca's to leave our
keys with her,' said Anna, shutting the front

134
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,120
door quietly behind her.

135
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,360
'She said she'd come in and make sure everything
is OK while we're away.

136
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Remember?

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,560
Oh, and did you write down our holiday address
for her - she said she wanted it in case of

138
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
emergencies.

139
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,010
Though I don't think I want to know if there
are any emergencies, do you?

140
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,019
Now where did I put the car keys?'

141
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,589
'You always think you've lost the keys, and
you never have,' said Stephen.

142
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,480
'I think you just say it to annoy me.

143
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,800
Get in and drive!

144
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,750
I've got the address for Rebecca, I've got
the map, I've got the address of the cottage

145
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,279
and you've got enough bottles of suntan cream
to protect an army.

146
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,750
Now, come on!

147
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,950
We're wasting valuable holiday time!'

148
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,160
'Right.

149
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,329
I'll drive first.

150
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,580
Why don't you go to sleep?

151
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,140
I'll wake you when it's your turn to drive,'
said Anna.

152
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,050
London looked a bit like a ghost town at seven
o'clock that Saturday morning.

153
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,649
Either everybody had left it for their own
holidays or they were still in bed.

154
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,750
It was good to leave the city behind as Anna
set off west along the M4 on the 500 kilometre

155
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,800
drive to Polreath.

156
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,080
Polreath was a small, quiet fishing village
on the north-west coast of Cornwall with a

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,480
few holiday cottages, two hotels, and the
usual shops, bars and restaurants.

158
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,180
It was famous for its seafood restaurants
- lobsters, prawns, crabs - and relatively

159
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,540
unspoilt - a great place to relax.

160
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,480
It would take most of the day to get there
but Anna was happy to drive.

161
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,820
It gave her time to think about last night
when Stephen had come home from work.

162
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,950
He had looked almost ill - he said it was
only the heat and the traffic, and he just

163
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,130
needed some peace and quiet.

164
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,191
He had gone into the garden with a bottle
of beer and walked around looking as if he

165
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:33,000
was interested in the flowers (which she knew
he wasn't).

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,769
She had left him alone and after a while,
he came in for dinner, seeming a bit more

167
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,769
cheerful.

168
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:44,269
They had had a perfectly pleasant evening
talking about arrangements for the next day

169
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,149
and had gone to bed without mentioning work.

170
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,930
But later, she had woken up and heard him
in the kitchen, talking to someone on the

171
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,070
telephone.

172
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,960
When he had come back to bed, she had pretended
to be asleep.

173
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,769
In the morning, neither of them had mentioned
it.

174
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:10,560
'Oh well, when we've both relaxed, perhaps
he'll talk about it,' thought Anna.

175
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,579
The sun was behind her and she could feel
its warmth on her shoulders.

176
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:21,019
There wasn't much traffic about so she put
her foot down, and as the kilometres passed,

177
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:26,050
she felt her head begin to clear of all the
worries, the questions.

178
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,310
She put a cassette on quietly - a little Mozart
for company, perfect - and started to enjoy

179
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,310
the drive.

180
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,670
'Where are we?' asked Stephen sleepily.

181
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,550
'We've just passed Bristol, so I suppose we're
doing well,' said Anna.

182
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,240
'Your turn to drive.'

183
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,620
'OK.

184
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,899
Let's stop and have a cup of coffee first.'

185
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:55,850
Anna turned into the next service area where
they had to queue for a fairly awful cup of

186
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,980
coffee.

187
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,820
Half an hour later, they were back on the
road, this time with Stephen driving.

188
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,220
He changed the music to an Ella Fitzgerald
tape and Anna attempted to sing along with

189
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,220
her.

190
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,699
'I think I prefer Ella Fitzgerald to you,
if you don't mind,' joked Stephen.

191
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,899
'Sorry, this song always makes me want to
sing,' replied Anna.

192
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,190
'Don't worry, I'll go to sleep in a minute.'

193
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,029
Stephen turned off the motorway.

194
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:31,040
He reckoned it would take about another three
hours to get to Polreath.

195
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Anna was asleep.

196
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,600
'She wasn't last night, though, when I came
back to bed after that phone call, I know.

197
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,680
She's not very good at pretending.'

198
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,760
Stephen looked at her lovingly.

199
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,990
'Perhaps it was a mistake to ring Mark, but
I wanted to tell him what Charlie had said

200
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,730
about making someone redundant.

201
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,500
Now all I've done is make Mark feel bad, too.

202
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,180
I must be going mad.

203
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,540
Why did I tell him?

204
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,079
He'll find out soon enough if he's going to
lose his job.'

205
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,850
Anna moved beside him.

206
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,910
'Not long now,' said Stephen, trying to forget
about work.

207
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,720
'I'll be really happy to get out of this hot
car, won't you?'

208
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
'Mmm.'

209
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,290
'First thing I'm going to do is have a swim,'
he said.

210
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:23,339
'What about unpacking the car, and buying
a few things like milk and bread for tomorrow's

211
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,339
breakfast?' said Anna.

212
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,260
'To hell with that.

213
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,550
We're on holiday and we're going to do what
we want to do, not what we should.

214
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,360
No more planning, no more thinking ahead,
no more worrying.'

215
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,970
'I'll remember you said that.

216
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:47,980
This sounds as if it's going to be an interesting
three weeks.'

217
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,980
CHAPTER THREE

218
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,550
Polreath

219
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,030
Their first view of Polreath was from the
top of a hill.

220
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,410
'Oh look, Stephen!

221
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,709
The sea!

222
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,370
And lots of little boats.

223
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,399
It looks wonderful,' said Anna.

224
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,069
There was a big sign at the side of the road-telling
motorists not to drive into the village, that

225
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,639
they must leave their cars in the car park.

226
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,639
'Right.

227
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,060
Let's leave everything here.

228
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,699
I'm going for a swim,' said Stephen.

229
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:25,620
'Me too,' replied Anna.

230
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,560
They walked hand in hand down the steep, narrow
street to the beach below.

231
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,910
The water wasn't wonderfully warm - this was
the Atlantic after all - but even so that

232
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,800
first swim was almost magical.

233
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,509
Stephen lay on his back, looking at the sky
and enjoying the first taste of freedom.

234
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:54,220
Anna had swum quite a long way out but was
now coming up towards him.

235
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,639
He turned towards her and they managed a salty
kiss.

236
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,339
'Hello, love.

237
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:04,480
Welcome to our new world,' said Anna softly.

238
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,910
'Hi, little one,' he said.

239
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,589
'You look ten years younger already.

240
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,590
And that's after only one swim!'

241
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,000
They kissed again.

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,170
'Come on,' said Stephen, 'that's enough for
now.'

243
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,019
'What, swimming or kissing?' asked Anna.

244
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,200
'Both,' he smiled, and kissed her again.

245
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
They swam slowly back to the beach.

246
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,269
The sun still felt warm, so they sat on the
sand for a few minutes with their towels wrapped

247
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,830
round them.

248
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,949
Outside a pub, people were sitting with drinks
and watching them in a leisurely way.

249
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:53,950
Anna and Stephen - the only ones on the beach
at that time suddenly realised that everyone's

250
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,279
eyes were on them, so they picked up their
things and left.

251
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:04,600
'We'd better go and introduce ourselves to
Mr Goddard and get the key for the cottage,'

252
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Stephen said.

253
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,370
'He said to come to his house.

254
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,789
What was it called, Anna?'

255
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,260
'Seahorses,' she replied.

256
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,100
'We passed it on the way down the hill.

257
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,350
Look, you go.

258
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,230
I want to change my clothes.

259
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:26,230
'I don't know, one look at you in your swimsuit
and he might put the price down,' he replied.

260
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,300
'Very funny!

261
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,930
I'll wait on the corner over there,' she said,
giving him a little push.

262
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,020
Anna watched as Stephen knocked on the door
of Seahorses.

263
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,700
A youngish man appeared and she could hear
Stephen introduce himself.

264
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,740
'Mr Goddard?

265
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,390
Hello, I'm Stephen Martins.

266
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,300
Sorry about my appearance but we got so hot
travelling down here that we had to have a

267
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,270
quick swim,' he said.

268
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,990
'No problem.

269
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,980
I'm pleased you've arrived.

270
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm Tristan Goddard.

271
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,830
Welcome.'

272
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,840
He looked over Stephen's shoulder and saw
Anna standing at the corner.

273
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,230
She gave a small wave and smiled.

274
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,450
'That's Anna,' said Stephen.

275
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,810
'She said she'd come and introduce herself
when she's changed.'

276
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,980
'Fine.

277
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,659
Well look, this is the key for Dolphin Cottage.

278
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:26,860
Go down to the harbour, turn right and follow
that little road until you come to a stone

279
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
cottage.

280
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,730
You can't miss it, it's the only one with
a green door.'

281
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,230
'Thanks.

282
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,440
By the way, what about cars in the village?'

283
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,570
Stephen asked.

284
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,520
'Can I bring the car down?

285
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,180
It's in the car park at the top of the hill
at the moment.'

286
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,860
'Yeah,' replied Tristan.

287
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,680
'You can bring it down to unpack everything,
but then you'll have to take it back up to

288
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,710
the car park.

289
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,540
We're trying to keep the village free of cars
as much as possible.

290
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,630
It used to be a real problem with the fishermen
trying to get up and down to the harbour in

291
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,160
their vans, and visitors parking on the streets.

292
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,850
So now no visitors' cars are allowed.

293
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,850
Sorry.'

294
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,010
'That's OK,' Stephen said, 'I'll be perfectly
happy without it.'

295
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,010
'Fine.

296
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,540
I'll come down a bit later then to see that
everything's OK,' said Tristan.

297
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,420
Tristan stood on the step and watched Stephen
join Anna.

298
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,090
As they walked down the street holding hands,
he couldn't help noticing how good she looked

299
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,020
in her swim suit.

300
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,010
They seemed very comfortable with each other,
he thought, and wondered how long they'd been

301
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,200
together.

302
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Half-smiling, he turned and went back into
the house, with the picture of Stephen and

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,130
Anna still in his head.

304
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:46,860
Then the picture changed to him and Jill last
summer when they'd been so happy.

305
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:53,220
Now she was in London and God knows when they
were going to be together again, if ever.

306
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,490
She refused to live in Polreath - she said
it was 'too dead in the winter', and he knew

307
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,840
he couldn't live in London.

308
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,760
In fact, he had no wish to live anywhere but
Polreath.

309
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,559
To him it had everything.

310
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,510
For seven months of the year, the visitors
brought life and work to the village and for

311
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,360
the remaining five months the locals had the
place to themselves.

312
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,490
He loved it in the middle of winter when the
sea was rough and the waves crashed over the

313
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,210
harbour wall.

314
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,750
It was impossible then for any of the fishermen
to go to sea.

315
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:35,179
And the village had the feeling of being an
island with no way of escape.

316
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,720
Jill had wanted to leave as soon as the summer
had finished, to go back to the bright lights.

317
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,860
This summer, she'd been down and for a few
weeks they'd got on as well together as last

318
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,420
year.

319
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,000
But soon he had seen that she was getting
bored.

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,720
And then the telephone call with the promise
of a new, exciting job had pulled her back

321
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,620
to London.

322
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:06,170
They still spoke on the phone, but in his
heart, he knew that the whole thing was over.

323
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,480
He sighed sadly and sat down to plan his work
for tomorrow.

324
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,830
During the summer months, he took visitors
in his boat to Skellig - the island off the

325
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,980
headland - on fishing trips and on daylong
trips along the coast, and anything else they

326
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,169
wanted to do.

327
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,590
And he still managed to do a bit of fishing
between trips.

328
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:36,529
His first trip was at 9.30 - ten people to
take to Skellig.

329
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:41,419
He left the front door open to get a bit more
air into the house and walked down the narrow

330
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,289
streets to Dolphin Cottage.

331
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,240
'Hello, anyone at home?'

332
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,650
called Tristan.

333
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,059
'Oh hello.

334
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,250
I'm Anna.

335
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,210
Come in.'

336
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,900
Anna led the way into the kitchen.

337
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,610
Tristan followed and thought she looked good
in jeans, too.

338
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,679
Stephen was putting things away in cupboards.

339
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,440
'Is everything OK?

340
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,130
Have you found your way around?' asked Tristan.

341
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,160
Stephen smiled, 'Yes, everything's just perfect.

342
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,210
And thank you for buying the bread and milk
and things.

343
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,500
How much do we owe you for that?'

344
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,140
'Don't worry about it now, you can pay me
at the end.

345
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,000
I thought you might arrive after the shop
had closed so I just bought a few essentials.'

346
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,950
'Thanks a lot,' said Anna.

347
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,690
Stephen had told Anna that Tristan seemed
'very nice', and she had to agree.

348
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,900
She found herself almost staring at him.

349
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:49,529
He had the most amazing eyes - sort of strong
blue - that seemed to look through you.

350
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:55,390
She thought he must be in his early thirties,
about the same age as Stephen, but taller

351
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,850
and slimmer, and with those wonderful eyes!

352
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,010
He was saying something to Stephen but she
wasn't really listening.

353
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,700
'What do you think, Anna?

354
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,150
Shall we go?' said Stephen.

355
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,150
'What?

356
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,460
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

357
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,419
Shall we go where?'

358
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:18,970
'Tristan was just saying that he was running
a boat trip to a little island at half past

359
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,799
nine tomorrow morning and would we like to
go?' said Stephen.

360
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,130
Anna said, 'Really?

361
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,630
Do you often do boat trips?'

362
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,450
'Yes, there's something happening every day.

363
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,299
In fact, you should find a list of trips on
the wall by the back door.'

364
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:40,020
Tristan pointed, 'Yes, look, there it is.'

365
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,789
She made herself turn round to look.

366
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:48,400
'I'd really quite like to explore Polreath
tomorrow morning,' Anna said.

367
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,320
'It seems funny to go on a trip before we've
had a look round here first.

368
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,420
We can go on the boat any day'

369
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
'True.

370
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,850
We'll do that then, Tristan,' said Stephen.

371
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,590
'Have a day wandering around the village and
then come with you later in the week.'

372
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,679
'OK.

373
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,750
Well, I'll be off now and leave you to it,'
Tristan said, moving towards the door.

374
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,100
'If you've got any problems, you know where
I live.

375
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,090
Bye for now.'

376
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:23,770
Half an hour later, Stephen and Anna were
sitting outside drinking coffee in the front

377
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,300
garden.

378
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,720
The cottage was exactly how they'd imagined
it - a traditional fisherman's cottage built

379
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,100
of stone with very thick walls to keep out
the wind.

380
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,200
The tiny garden at the front looked over the
harbour.

381
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,309
'I can't believe our luck.

382
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:46,370
Can you imagine anything more ideal than this?'
asked Anna.

383
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,520
'And what about Tristan?

384
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,610
Don't you think he's got the most amazing
eyes.

385
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,190
I couldn't stop looking at him.'

386
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,520
'I noticed!

387
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,640
Actually, you're right, his eyes are interesting.

388
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,000
I'd like eyes like that.'

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,120
'So would I. And I wouldn't mind his hair
either.

390
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,289
It's all curly like yours is when you've just
had a shower, except his is really blond.'

391
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:18,320
'OK, that's enough about Tristan,' laughed
Stephen.

392
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,740
'I might get jealous.

393
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:27,000
Anyway, he can't be so good-looking and a
really nice person - there's probably something

394
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,870
wrong with him!'

395
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:35,460
Later, Stephen came into the bedroom drying
his hair after a cool shower.

396
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,000
Anna looked at him and smiled.

397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,670
She wondered if he remembered the conversation
about Tristan's hair.

398
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,159
Had he come in with wet hair deliberately,
just to remind her that she'd always liked

399
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,270
his hair?

400
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:55,520
They lay there, side by side, touching, with
the sound of the sea coming through the open

401
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,810
window.

402
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,110
CHAPTER FOUR

403
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,380
Exploring the village

404
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,880
The next day, Anna woke up not long after
dawn.

405
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,220
She could hear seagulls crying.

406
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,549
She thought about an early morning walk.

407
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:24,330
Maybe tomorrow, she decided, and turned over
for a bit more sleep.

408
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,330
She didn't notice that Stephen wasn't lying
beside her.

409
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,740
Stephen had woken up even earlier and had
heard the sounds of the birds.

410
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,520
He lay there for a time, listening, but slowly
his mind started to fill up with memories

411
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,309
of his last conversation with his boss.

412
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:49,220
'Oh no,' he thought, 'I don't want to start
thinking about that now.

413
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm on holiday, I need a break.'

414
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,400
But the problems of the last few weeks at
work wouldn't go away.

415
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,570
He could feel his stomach begin to get tight
- a sure sign that he was getting worried.

416
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:10,320
'It's no good,' he thought, 'I'll have to
get up and do something.'

417
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,630
Quietly, he got dressed and left the cottage.

418
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,720
The sun had just risen and the air already
felt warm.

419
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,340
He started jogging up the hill out of the
village, hoping that some physical activity

420
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,590
would help.

421
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,260
By the time, he reached the top he was a bit
out of breath.

422
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:37,510
He looked into the car park to make sure the
car was still there, then carried on walking.

423
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,091
There was a signpost saying "Footpath" so
he went along it.

424
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:45,340
It led to the edge of the cliff.

425
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,909
At this point, he was standing about a hundred
metres above the sea, looking back down onto

426
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:52,399
Polreath harbour.

427
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:59,179
It was a wonderful view - one he felt he'd
always remember.

428
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:04,330
There were one or two people on their boats
in the harbour, including a blond-haired man.

429
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,740
'I wonder if that's Tristan,' thought Stephen.

430
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,600
He watched the activity in the harbour and
slowly the tightness in his stomach started

431
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,910
to go away.

432
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,610
He felt calmer.

433
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,840
He realised that the problems at work were
not going to disappear; he was going to have

434
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,159
to think about his job clearly and carefully,
and decide what he really wanted to do.

435
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,600
And try and talk to Anna about it.

436
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,260
Once or twice recently, he had seen her looking
at him almost angrily.

437
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,110
'Poor Anna,' he thought.

438
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,740
'She must get fed up with me sometimes.'

439
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:52,059
He had started to walk back along the path
when he heard voices from the harbour below.

440
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:57,419
He turned and saw a dark-haired man standing
at the front of a fishing boat, shouting at

441
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,350
the blond man.

442
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,840
They seemed to be having some sort of argument.

443
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,510
The dark-haired man kept pointing at the blond
man's boat.

444
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,601
Stephen enjoyed the fact that other people
seemed to have problems at work, too, not

445
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,650
just him!

446
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,679
And he watched as the two small boats left
the harbour.

447
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,340
When he got back to Dolphin Cottage with some
fresh bread, Anna was sitting in the front

448
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,120
garden with a cup of coffee.

449
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,540
She looked at him closely and said, 'Hello,
are you all right?'

450
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,520
'Yes, I'm fine.

451
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,779
I woke up early and decided to get some exercise...
and some fresh bread.

452
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,059
Here, smell it, straight from the baker's.'

453
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,059
'Mm, delicious.

454
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,679
Let's have breakfast out here.

455
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,370
You can tell me what the village is like.'

456
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,840
Stephen told her about the argument in the
harbour, and how he was sure one of the men

457
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,269
was Tristan, but he didn't tell her what had
made him get up so early.

458
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:04,090
Time to get serious later, not now.

459
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:10,010
Stephen and Anna spent the rest of the morning
wandering round the village.

460
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,630
They walked up and down the narrow streets
and paths, looking at everything.

461
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:21,390
Most of the houses near the harbour were like
theirs - old stone cottages.

462
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,620
There were one or two which were obviously
holiday cottages but most of them still seemed

463
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,550
to be lived in by local people.

464
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:35,890
A bit further away from the harbour, it seemed
to be more mixed - some more modern houses

465
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:41,370
and one or two very fine ones which had probably
been built when it had first become fashionable

466
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,980
for city people to take their holidays by
the sea.

467
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:53,309
In one of the small side streets, they found
Philpots, a restaurant specializing in seafood.

468
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,260
The menu promised lobster, crab and fish,
all freshly caught.

469
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,630
'This looks wonderful.'

470
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,130
'And look at the prices!

471
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,029
This lot would cost twice as much in London.'

472
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,000
Stephen felt a hand on his shoulder.

473
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,010
'Morning.'

474
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,710
Tristan was standing behind them in shorts
and a T-shirt.

475
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,370
'You were up early today, Stephen.

476
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,320
I saw you leaving the cottage.'

477
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,919
'Yes, I went jogging,' replied Stephen.

478
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,990
'I didn't see you, though.'

479
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,649
'I was on the boat - just going out for an
hour or two's fishing,' said Tristan.

480
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:34,860
'Ah, so it was him,' thought Stephen.

481
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,639
'Did you catch anything?' he asked Tristan.

482
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,539
'I just put down the lobster pots.

483
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,429
I'll go back later and pull them up.

484
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:46,490
I usually get a few and then sell them to
this place.

485
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,519
So if you eat here tonight, they might be
serving my lobsters,' said Tristan, looking

486
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,669
at Anna.

487
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:54,830
'Great,' said Anna.

488
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,410
'How was the trip to the island?'

489
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,520
'Oh fine.

490
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,800
I left the people there for the day.

491
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,280
There's not much to do, but that's what's
attractive, I suppose.

492
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,080
They just walk round, look at the few people
who actually live there and think how wonderful

493
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,530
it'd be to have a house on a small island.

494
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,779
They see it on a wonderful, sunny day like
today and don't think about the times in the

495
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,460
winter when it's cut off for days by the storms.

496
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,029
But it's a very special place and you need
to be a special kind of person to be able

497
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,580
to enjoy it!'

498
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:35,020
For some reason, Stephen felt Tristan was
that special kind of person - a man who would

499
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,980
be happy with his own company.

500
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,860
'Well, see you later.

501
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,909
Have a good day,' said Tristan, and walked
off in the direction of the harbour.

502
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:49,409
'Let's go and have lunch in that pub by the
beach, and plan the rest of the day,' said

503
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:50,409
Anna.

504
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,929
'OK,' replied Stephen.

505
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,890
'Well, we now know two things about Tristan.

506
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:02,340
One, not everybody here likes him - remember
I told you about that argument in the harbour

507
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:08,760
this morning - and two, he seems to have strong
feelings about the island.'

508
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,260
'And three, he's got nice legs!' said Anna
as she watched him climb onto his boat.

509
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
'Anna!

510
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,590
Can't you think of anything except his eyes
and legs?

511
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,590
Honestly!

512
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,669
And they say it's men who think about sex
all the time!'

513
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,140
Stephen's voice sounded half-serious.

514
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,680
Actually, he was a bit surprised.

515
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,669
He'd never known Anna talk so openly about
a man's physical appearance.

516
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,559
He didn't quire know whether to be worried
about it.

517
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,149
'Its all right.

518
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,169
I'm only joking.

519
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:45,890
I'm sure he's a very interesting person...

520
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,679
as well as good to look at!'

521
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,990
At the Fisherman's Arms, they had crab salads
and ice-cold beer.

522
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,860
They sat outside in friendly silence and watched
the activity on the beach.

523
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,730
'Shall we walk over in that direction this
afternoon?'

524
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,230
Stephen pointed to the left.

525
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,419
'We could go along the coast path - see what
there is over the hill.'

526
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:16,909
'OK, but let's not hurry off just yet,' said
Anna.

527
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,060
They got some more drinks.

528
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,429
Anna stretched out her long legs in the sun
and started to read the guidebook for the

529
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,240
area.

530
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,899
Stephen watched her while drinking his beer.

531
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,899
Everything about her seemed so familiar.

532
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:38,079
'She looks so happy sitting there, like a
cat in the sun,' he thought.

533
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,550
'She's got a lovely face, so full of life
and smiles - except when I worry her with

534
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,200
my silences.'

535
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,310
He suddenly heard a loud voice behind him.

536
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,270
'Bloody Tristan,' said a man at another table.

537
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,760
'He thinks he owns the village.

538
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,260
Why does he want to buy another house?

539
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,410
He's already got two.

540
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,600
How many more does he want?'

541
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
'Ssh.

542
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,270
Not so loud, Jack.

543
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:12,160
In any case, you don't know if he does yet,'
said the man sitting with him in a low voice.

544
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,600
'Well, you heard him asking about how much
the cottage was being sold for.

545
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,510
He wants it, I'm sure,' said Jack.

546
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:25,130
'Then he'll rent it out as a holiday place,
just like he's done with Dolphin Cottage.'

547
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,870
Anna and Stephen sat there, pretending not
to listen.

548
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:35,220
'Come on, he's got to rent Dolphin Cottage
out, he can't live in two places at once,

549
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,580
can he?

550
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,310
In any case, that woman, what's her name,
Jane...

551
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,700
Jill, has been living there,' the other man
said.

552
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,560
'Well, she doesn't live there now, does she?'

553
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,599
replied Jack.

554
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,300
'I don't know, he talks a lot about trying
to keep the village the same - "unspoilt",

555
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,930
that's what he says - but if you ask me, it'll
be ruined in a few years' time.'

556
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,410
'This place has stood here for a few hundred
years, I'm sure it'll go on a bit longer.

557
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,540
Anyway, I don't believe Tristan'll buy another
cottage - why should he?'

558
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,810
'I asked him this morning, and he didn't say
no,' Jack answered.

559
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,710
'Knowing you, you probably didn't give him
time to answer your question before you got

560
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,030
angry with him,' the other man replied.

561
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:30,280
The man called Jack left the pub, still complaining
about 'bloody Tristan'.

562
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,790
The other man stayed at the bar, staring into
his beer.

563
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,790
'Help!'

564
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,109
whispered Anna.

565
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:42,070
'I'm glad he didn't realise we were the people
renting Dolphin Cottage.'

566
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,550
'Come on,' said Stephen, standing up.

567
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,849
'Let's go for our walk.'

568
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:52,000
They walked out of the village along the coast
path.

569
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,900
Although they talked about what they'd heard
in the bar, they were not really worried - just

570
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,060
interested in the life of the village and
what part Tristan Goddard played in it.

571
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,530
They knew that over the next three weeks they'd
probably discover what it was all about.

572
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:15,250
They followed the path through some trees,
happy to escape from the hot sun for a while.

573
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,650
Eventually, they walked round a corner and
came to a wide bay with people surfing on

574
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,980
beautiful, white waves.

575
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,050
'Hey, that looks fun,' said Stephen.

576
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,540
'I've always wanted to try it.'

577
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,490
'I did it once when I was about fifteen,'
said Anna.

578
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,060
'I wasn't very good at it.

579
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,730
Every time I stood up, I fell off.

580
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,160
But I'll have another go.

581
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,710
Age might have improved my balance.'

582
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:49,109
A woman in the beach shop told them they could
hire surfboards there and, if they wanted,

583
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:51,150
they could also have lessons.

584
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,250
'Right.

585
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,660
So, there's no reason why we shouldn't try,
then.

586
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,290
Thanks for the information.

587
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,150
We'll be back another day,' Stephen smiled.

588
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:06,890
They walked slowly back towards Polreath,
changed into their swimming things at the

589
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,359
cottage and went down to the beach.

590
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:16,420
The sand was warm from the day's sun and Stephen
fell asleep lying there.

591
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,700
Anna continued reading her local guidebook.

592
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,500
This was always the first thing she bought
when she went to a new place, and a map of

593
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,760
the area.

594
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,981
She enjoyed getting information, which she'd
then pass on to Stephen - who, actually, didn't

595
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:33,760
always want to know!

596
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,619
In fact, she sometimes annoyed him with her
facts.

597
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:44,650
Stephen woke up, saw Anna with her nose in
the book and knew that tonight in the restaurant

598
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,400
she was going to say, 'I read in the guide
book that...'

599
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,369
many times!

600
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:55,830
He turned over quietly and ran his finger
down her back.

601
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,010
'Oh, hello!

602
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,579
Had a good sleep?

603
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,790
You probably needed it after your early start
this morning.'

604
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,170
'Mmm.'

605
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,750
He stood up and stretched.

606
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,319
'Time for a swim?'

607
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,890
'Why not,' she replied.

608
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:21,900
'Then I'm going home for a quick sleep before
dinner.'

609
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,670
CHAPTER FIVE

610
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,890
Philpots

611
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,680
Sitting at dinner in Philpots that evening,
Anna felt wonderful.

612
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:39,000
The fresh air, the sun, the swimming, everything
had made her feel so alive.

613
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,470
She found it hard to remember the Anna of
a few days ago, and she almost couldn't recognise

614
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,920
Stephen he looked so relaxed.

615
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,130
'You've got a red nose,' she said.

616
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,930
'It's not red, it's the light in this restaurant.

617
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,240
And have you seen yours, by the way?'

618
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,800
'Yes, it looks very healthy,' she replied.

619
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,790
'Why is mine red and yours healthy?' he laughed.

620
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,990
'What are you having?'

621
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,880
she asked, changing the subject.

622
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,079
'Need you ask?' said Stephen.

623
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,280
'Lobster, of course.

624
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
And you?'

625
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
'The same.

626
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,930
Do you think it's one of Tristan's?'

627
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,520
'Will we be able to taste the difference?'
he joked.

628
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,890
Anna knew that over dinner, Stephen would
probably find it easy to start talking about

629
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,800
the things that were making him unhappy, but
she didn't want him to.

630
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,310
She wanted a relaxed, uncomplicated meal - an
evening without thinking about London, work

631
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,510
or Stephen's problems.

632
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,440
So she deliberately kept the conversation
away from anything serious.

633
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,020
'Hey, look at that!

634
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:54,900
Doesn't it look wonderful,' Anna said when
the waiter brought their plates to the table.

635
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,290
The warm lobster pieces covered each plate,
and a little bowl of extra sauce came with

636
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,640
it.

637
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:08,490
She dipped some bread into the sauce, 'This
is seriously delicious!'

638
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:14,850
The lobster was followed by a lime and lemon
dessert, and a wonderful selection of cheeses.

639
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,240
They finished with strong coffee.

640
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,190
'We're going to be all right here, aren't
we?' said Anna as they stood up to go.

641
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,210
'I think this is going to turn out to be our
best holiday ever.'

642
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,810
'I hope so,' said Stephen.

643
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,640
Just as they were leaving, Tristan arrived.

644
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,770
'Evening.

645
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,220
I thought you might be here,' he said.

646
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,640
'I just wondered if you'd like to come fishing
tomorrow morning Stephen?

647
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,910
You obviously get up early and I usually go
out about six, six thirty for a couple of

648
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,910
hours.

649
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,020
You too, Anna, if you'd like.'

650
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,619
'Thanks, Tristan,' said Stephen, 'I'd enjoy
that.

651
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,680
What about you, Anna?'

652
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,339
'I'd rather have a bit longer in bed tomorrow
morning.

653
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,369
I'm still catching up on my sleep.

654
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:04,010
But you go, Stephen.'

655
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,099
'Meet me at the harbour at about six tomorrow
then,' said Tristan.

656
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,030
'It's a blue boat called Wave Dancer.'

657
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,330
'Right.

658
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,849
See you there, and thanks again.

659
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:16,849
Goodnight.'

660
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:20,790
'That should be interesting,' said Anna to
Stephen as they walked home.

661
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:26,119
'I shall expect you to find out everything
about him - all that business with that man

662
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,080
in the pub yesterday, who the woman is who
lived in our cottage - everything, please.'

663
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,770
'I'm going fishing, I'm not going to question
him about his private life!'

664
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,770
Stephen laughed.

665
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:43,910
'If I catch anything we can have it for tomorrow
night's dinner, can't we?'

666
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,760
'Yes, but don't bring home a lobster, please.

667
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,980
I don't know whether I could cook one of those.

668
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:55,220
They're alive when you put them in boiling
water and they make a terrible noise.

669
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,390
I know it's stupid but I'd rather eat lobster
at Philpots and not hear them dying.'

670
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,160
'Don't worry,' Stephen said.

671
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,200
'I don't expect Tristan will let me have one.

672
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,680
I should think he needs to sell the expensive
stuff to make some money'

673
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,609
At six the next morning, Tristan was waiting
on his boat, Wave Dancer.

674
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:22,260
He was dressed in the shorts he seemed to
live in during the hot weather.

675
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,290
He was wondering why he'd asked Stephen and
Anna to come with him.

676
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,890
He didn't usually ask the Dolphin Cottage
people out on his boat in his 'private' time,

677
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:36,349
but there was something he liked about Stephen
and Anna - they were different.

678
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:41,819
But was he feeling just the smallest bit of
disappointment that it was only Stephen who

679
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,110
was coming?

680
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,599
He turned and looked up at Dolphin Cottage,
just in time to see Stephen coming out, pulling

681
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,349
a black T-shirt over his head.

682
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:55,650
A few minutes later, he jumped onto the boat.

683
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,060
'Am I late?

684
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,650
Sorry,' he said.

685
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,380
'Had a bit of difficulty waking up this morning.

686
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,770
Could be something to do with the excellent
wine last night!'

687
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,420
Tristan smiled.

688
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,980
'Do you know anything about boats?' he asked.

689
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,070
'Sure.

690
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,580
I'm used to boats.

691
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:23,060
We always had holidays by the sea when I was
a kid, and my parents taught me what to do.'

692
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,910
They left the harbour and turned north following
the coast.

693
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,000
Tristan dropped some lobster pots into the
sea and said he'd collect them later that

694
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,770
day.

695
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,560
The sea was calm as they continued northwards.

696
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,750
It was a bit cooler on the water than on the
land and Stephen was pleased he'd remembered

697
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,960
his sweater.

698
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,040
He'd left Anna in bed, sleeping like a baby.

699
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,060
She hadn't even woken up when he'd dropped
his keys on the floor.

700
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,660
Lucky her!

701
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,510
Being out on the sea was beginning to work
its magic.

702
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:05,200
As the boat rose and fell gently, Stephen
remembered his excitement as a child on fishing

703
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,089
trips with his father.

704
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:13,530
His memories of his childhood holidays were
of fishing with his father for hours, not

705
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,450
saying much but enjoying the activity.

706
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,800
It was one of the few times they'd spent a
lot of time together.

707
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,490
Now it was too late.

708
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:29,840
His father had died a year ago from an unexpected
heart attack, leaving Stephen full of things

709
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,500
he'd wanted to say to him.

710
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,930
Today, the sea was calm.

711
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,050
The sun made the tops of the waves dance and
shine.

712
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:46,320
And when Tristan stopped the boat there was
silence, no more noise from the engine, just

713
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,640
the rather sad sounds from a few seagulls.

714
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,390
Together they started fishing off the back
of the boat.

715
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,300
After a few minutes Tristan said, 'Got one.'

716
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,920
He pulled in the fish and said, 'Mm, a mackerel.

717
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,390
Nothing special, but quite nice grilled on
the barbecue.

718
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,210
Right, I can relax now.

719
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,200
I always think it's a good sign to catch the
first fish quickly.

720
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,130
I think we're going to have an excellent couple
of hours.'

721
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:22,849
'I hope so,' replied Stephen, Anna wants something
for tonight's dinner.'

722
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:26,559
'Are you both OK in Dolphin Cottage?

723
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,570
It's not very modern, I'm afraid.

724
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,530
I haven't done much to it, really.

725
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:35,180
My grandmother lived there all her life and
she left it to me when she died four years

726
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,180
ago.'

727
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,380
'We're absolutely fine.

728
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,569
We love it.

729
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:43,599
Actually, I don't think we'll ever want to
leave it.'

730
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,490
Tristan looked at him rather sharply.

731
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,490
'Sorry.

732
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,930
Have I said something wrong?' said Stephen.

733
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,630
'No, not at all.'

734
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,100
Tristan shook his head.

735
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,200
'I was just remembering someone else who said
that about the cottage.

736
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,829
But in fact she did leave in the end.'

737
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:05,890
'You're very lucky to live in such a beautiful
place.

738
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,109
Have you always lived here?'

739
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:12,140
Stephen was interested in getting people to
talk about themselves - and it was easier

740
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,460
than talking about himself.

741
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,380
'Yes, except when I went away for four years
to university.'

742
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,869
Stephen hadn't expected that.

743
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:28,330
Apparently, Tristan had left Polreath when
he was eighteen and had been very excited

744
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,589
about living in a city.

745
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:34,200
But he'd found that he missed the sea and
the open spaces.

746
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,650
'Now, when I have to go to London, I look
at people's faces and see how difficult life

747
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,160
is for a lot of them,' Tristan explained.

748
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,420
All that running about and all that fear.

749
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,420
You know - fear of crime, fear of losing your
job.

750
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,350
I couldn't live like that.

751
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,770
I've tried and I know.

752
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,089
Polreath is home for me.

753
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,609
I know it is.'

754
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,309
'Have you got any family here?'

755
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,309
asked Stephen.

756
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,809
'Only my sister now,' Tristan replied.

757
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:07,290
My parents moved away when my father retired
from fishing.

758
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,470
But my sister and I are very close.

759
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,710
She's happy here, like me.'

760
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,560
Stephen listened to what Tristan was saying
and, for the first time, he began to feel

761
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,829
he understood.

762
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:25,990
Of course, he'd heard other people say how
hard city living was, and he'd even said it

763
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,670
himself.

764
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,490
In fact, last year when they were on their
way home from two weeks' holiday in Greece,

765
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:38,090
he'd suggested to Anna that they should sell
their house and move to somewhere peaceful.

766
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,119
But he'd known it was only a dream.

767
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,319
When he'd gone back to the agency the following
Monday he found he enjoyed the office politics

768
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:53,240
and the competition for new business - it
made him feel alive and at the centre of things.

769
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,530
But now, something was different.

770
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,420
Perhaps it was because everything at work
was so uncertain.

771
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,700
Again, there was silence in the boat.

772
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,660
Both men watched the water to see if any fish
were biting, and both men were deep in their

773
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,059
own thoughts.

774
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:16,599
They each caught some fish - mainly mackerel
- and Tristan talked a little more about Polreath

775
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,450
and his life there.

776
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,660
Stephen liked the easy way in which Tristan
talked; he knew that that was how Anna would

777
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,780
like him to be.

778
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,869
'Well, we'd better go back, I suppose,' said
Tristan.

779
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:32,710
'I've got a trip to do later.

780
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,339
How many have you caught?'

781
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,339
'Four.

782
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:38,880
Not bad for a city boy!'

783
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,020
Stephen replied.

784
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:47,520
There was something in Stephen's voice that
made Tristan look at him.

785
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,240
CHAPTER SIX

786
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,240
The phone call

787
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:57,240
Anna was in the front garden of Dolphin Cottage
and she waved as she saw the boat come in

788
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,700
to the harbour.

789
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,510
'You two seem very happy together,' said Tristan.

790
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,520
'Yes,' Stephen agreed.

791
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,260
They had known Tristan for only a few days
and it seemed to Stephen a rather personal

792
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,660
thing to say.

793
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,390
But then Stephen realised he didn't mind.

794
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,980
'Have you got anyone special?' he asked.

795
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:26,380
'Sort of,' Tristan replied, and busied himself
tying up the boat to the harbour side.

796
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,339
He didn't really feel like going into detail
about it at that moment.

797
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:34,950
One reason was that he was thinking about
Anna, not Jill.

798
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,270
'Thanks for the trip,' said Stephen.

799
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,690
'It was great.

800
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:45,180
By the way, if you're not doing anything tonight,
would you like to come and have dinner with

801
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,180
us?

802
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,380
We could barbecue the fish.

803
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,240
Bring your friend, if you want.'

804
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,240
'OK.

805
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,240
Thanks.

806
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,369
It'll just be me though,' said Tristan, pleased
at the thought of seeing Anna again.

807
00:50:58,369 --> 00:50:59,660
'Fine.

808
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,119
See you about eight, then.'

809
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,329
Stephen walked up from the harbour, and held
up his fish to show Anna.

810
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:10,430
But when he got nearer, he could see that
something was wrong.

811
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,510
'What's the matter?' he asked.

812
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,310
'Has something happened?'

813
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,530
'Afraid so.

814
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:21,770
Rebecca's just phoned and said your office
need you to ring them immediately.'

815
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,900
'Oh shit!

816
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,660
I knew we shouldn't have left our number with
Rebecca!' he said angrily.

817
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,210
'What the hell do they want?

818
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:34,780
I don't feel like ringing them back.

819
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,970
I think I just won't, and pretend we never
got the message.

820
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,369
Do you know if Rebecca told the office she
knew where we were?'

821
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:47,910
'Apparently she said she'd pass the message
on to you, so I guess you'll have to contact

822
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,910
them.'

823
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,869
'Oh bloody hell.'

824
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:55,020
Stephen threw the fish down on the table and
went inside.

825
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,069
She could hear him in the kitchen, noisily
making a cup of coffee.

826
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:03,490
She wondered what the problem was at his office.

827
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,890
She had met Charlie Jardine, Stephen's boss,
a couple of times and he'd seemed to be a

828
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,410
reasonable person.

829
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,770
What was it all about?

830
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:19,260
Stephen must be talking to him now - she could
hear his voice rising in anger, and then she

831
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,740
heard him put the phone down with a bang.

832
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,540
He came out and sat next to Anna.

833
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,380
His face was red with anger.

834
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,680
'Well?'

835
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,859
she asked.

836
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:34,540
'Charlie wants everybody back in the office
for a crisis meeting tomorrow.

837
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,540
Everybody!

838
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,619
And that includes me,' Stephen replied.

839
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:40,720
'Another agency wants to buy our company'

840
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,609
'Can't you talk about it on the phone?'

841
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:46,010
Anna asked.

842
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:52,140
'Apparently, things are happening so quickly
and he needs to be able to act fast.'

843
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,330
Stephen stood up and started walking up and
down the tiny front garden.

844
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,099
'And he says he wants to do what's best for
the company.

845
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:02,210
He sounded really worried on the phone.'

846
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:06,200
'So you're going then,' she said, rather coldly.

847
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,990
''I'll have to.

848
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:12,230
Mark's been called back from a conference
in Italy as well.'

849
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,260
'That's work, not a holiday,' said Anna sharply.

850
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,260
'I know.

851
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,290
Look, I'm sorry.'

852
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,960
Stephen put his arms round her.

853
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,530
'I know this has ruined things for you as
well.

854
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,930
If I go this morning, I'll come back straight
after the meeting.

855
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,310
I'll drive through the night if I have to,
but I promise I'll be back for breakfast on

856
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,630
Thursday'

857
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,160
'Could you lose your job if someone buys the
company?'

858
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,200
Anna asked.

859
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,220
'Yes, it's quite possible,' Stephen said.

860
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,220
'It's also possible I could lose it anyway.

861
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,640
The agency is obviously in a bad way, as far
as money goes.'

862
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,349
'Oh Stephen - just when we were beginning
to relax here.

863
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:04,599
It's not fair!' said Anna, close to tears.

864
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:08,730
Stephen finished his coffee and went back
into the cottage.

865
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,849
Anna continued to sit in the front garden.

866
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:17,920
Half an hour later, Stephen appeared, carrying
a small bag and wearing his work trousers.

867
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,590
'I'll walk with you to the car,' said Anna.

868
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:27,799
It felt unreal to both of them - him going,
her staying.

869
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:31,750
She could see that Stephen's mind was already
full of work.

870
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:37,579
The inside of the car was hot from being in
the sun, so they opened all the doors to let

871
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:40,010
some air in.

872
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,640
'You'll be OK on your own for two days, won't
you?' said Stephen.

873
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,450
'Yes, no problem, Don't worry about me.

874
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,910
You just be careful driving.

875
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,770
Take care, please.'

876
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,329
'I will.

877
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:55,900
Bye love.'

878
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,900
'Bye.

879
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,840
I don't know what to say... good luck, I suppose.

880
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,160
Ring me tonight from home - I want to know
you're there.'

881
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,270
Anna watched Stephen drive away.

882
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:21,640
'Poor man,' she thought, and then selfishly,
'I'm pleased I don't have to go, too.'

883
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,069
CHAPTER SEVEN

884
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:27,670
Tristan comes for dinner

885
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,650
Anna had a pleasant day.

886
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,270
It was difficult not to.

887
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:38,270
Polreath was the same interesting place and
the weather was wonderful again.

888
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,619
She walked around and did a bit of shopping.

889
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:45,589
Some people in the village were beginning
to greet her, 'Morning.

890
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:50,950
Another nice day,' they said, and she smiled
back.

891
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:55,589
She sat in the front garden of the cottage,
reading and watching all the comings and goings

892
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:57,450
in the harbour.

893
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:02,059
She was learning to recognise some of the
different boats - which ones were fishing

894
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:06,270
boats, and which ones were owned by visitors.

895
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:11,740
Tristan's boat, full of passengers, went out,
and she decided she'd find out where he was

896
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,270
going the next day.

897
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:19,210
It might be nice to do something with other
people tomorrow, she thought.

898
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:23,329
She looked at Stephen's fish in the fridge
and remembered how pleased he'd looked when

899
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:26,300
he'd got off Tristan's boat earlier that day.

900
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,500
'I'll have some later,' she thought.

901
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,820
'Don't want to waste them.'

902
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,839
In the late afternoon, she went for a swim.

903
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:41,930
Back home, she showered and sat with a glass
of white wine in the front garden until the

904
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,710
sun disappeared behind the hill.

905
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:48,180
Then she went inside to get some dinner.

906
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:52,150
There was a knock on the door, and Tristan
appeared.

907
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,270
'Hello, I hope I'm not late.'

908
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,650
'Pardon?' said Anna.

909
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,450
'Late for what?'

910
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,450
'Dinner.

911
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,940
Stephen asked me for dinner.'

912
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,099
Tristan could see something was wrong.

913
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:08,130
'Oh, no!

914
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,060
I can see you didn't know!'

915
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,060
'I'm sorry.

916
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,819
Come in.

917
00:57:13,819 --> 00:57:16,060
No, I didn't know.

918
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:20,619
The thing is,' explained Anna, 'Stephen's
had to go back to London.

919
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:26,160
He had a phone call when you were out fishing
this morning, and he's gone.'

920
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,079
'Oh, I'm sorry.

921
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,329
Is everything all right...?

922
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:34,660
I mean, I hope nothing bad has happened.'

923
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:40,060
Tristan meant what he said, but if he was
honest with himself, he was also pleased that

924
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,579
Anna was now here alone, without Stephen.

925
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:47,069
'It's a crisis at work,' Anna said.

926
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:50,090
'He didn't want to leave but...

927
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,039
He'll be back on Thursday, he says.'

928
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:54,420
'Oh good.

929
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,030
Anyway, I'll go.

930
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:58,400
Don't worry about dinner,' said Tristan.

931
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,910
'No, stay, really,' she said.

932
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,130
'I was just grilling the fish.

933
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,510
I can easily do some more.

934
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,309
Help yourself to a glass of wine.'

935
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:10,809
'Well, if you're sure.

936
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:11,809
Thanks.'

937
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:15,960
Tristan poured himself a drink and filled
up Anna's glass as well.

938
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,500
'Can I do anything?' he asked.

939
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,660
'You could cut the bread, if you want.

940
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,270
And take all the plates and stuff outside.

941
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:29,309
Is it OK with you if we eat outside?'

942
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:30,309
'Fine.'

943
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:33,190
Tristan carried everything into the front
garden and waited for Anna.

944
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:40,520
He felt a bit strange sitting there, remembering
other times he'd had dinner at the cottage.

945
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,230
Jill and he used to eat there most evenings
during their first summer together.

946
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,650
But when she was here earlier this year, though,
she seemed to prefer to eat at his house or

947
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,220
in the village somewhere.

948
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,490
The cottage had become Jill's private world.

949
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,039
Anna brought the fish.

950
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,009
Strange, he thought, to himself.

951
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:08,030
There's Jill and Stephen in London and Anna
and me here.

952
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,930
Tristan talked a bit about his day.

953
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:16,319
After the fishing that morning, he'd been
quite busy - two trips with a full boat each

954
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,920
time, up the coast looking at the land from
the sea.

955
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,720
He seemed surprised when she asked him if
he ever got bored doing the same trips every

956
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,720
week.

957
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,079
'Never bored,' he said.

958
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:33,460
'Annoyed maybe at some of the stupid questions
people ask sometimes.

959
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:38,589
But basically I can't think of a better way
of earning a living.'

960
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:41,010
The phone rang and made them both jump.

961
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:47,260
'That'll be Stephen, I hope,' said Anna and
went to answer it.

962
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:52,030
Tristan sat and thought how much he liked
Anna's company.

963
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:54,369
She came back out a few minutes later.

964
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:56,319
'Yes, it was.

965
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,990
He said sorry about tonight - about forgetting
to tell me you were coming to dinner.

966
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,549
And he says London is hot, airless and dirty!'

967
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:10,849
'Does he enjoy his job, whatever it is?' asked
Tristan.

968
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:13,630
'He works for an advertising agency.

969
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:17,010
To be honest, I don't know if he does enjoy
it any more.

970
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:21,369
He used to, but recently something's changed.

971
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:22,700
Maybe he's changed.

972
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:28,630
He was hoping - well, actually, I was hoping
- this holiday would give him a chance to

973
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:31,369
have a good think about it all.

974
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:34,849
Perhaps now, the decisions will be taken for
him.

975
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:38,730
He may come back on Thursday without a job.

976
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:43,100
But, I'm sorry, you probably don't want to
hear all that.

977
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,640
You were just being polite.'

978
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,079
'No, I wasn't... if you understand me.

979
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,579
I'm interested.

980
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,819
I like the little I know about Stephen.

981
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:55,950
I enjoyed our fishing trip this morning.'

982
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:00,599
Tristan paused and then said, 'Maybe it's
my turn to be honest.

983
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:06,080
You see, you and Stephen make me think about
myself and my...

984
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:12,990
I don't know what to call her - woman-friend,
girl-friend, whatever.'

985
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,869
Anna waited for him to go on.

986
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:21,770
He told her about Jill and him and the difficulties
of continuing a long-distance relationship.

987
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:26,079
He spoke quite openly about it all.

988
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,360
Anna couldn't help comparing him with Stephen.

989
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,740
Stephen always had such difficulty trying
to explain something personal.

990
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,400
The death of his father had hit him hard but
he still hadn't really talked about it with

991
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,890
her.

992
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:45,720
Only once, about three months ago, when she'd
found him in the kitchen crying, then he'd

993
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,520
managed to talk about it a bit.

994
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,410
Poor darling Stephen, people who only saw
his public face just didn't know him.

995
01:01:54,410 --> 01:02:02,369
They opened another bottle of wine and carried
on talking - about him, about her and Stephen,

996
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:05,830
about the village and the people who lived
there.

997
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:09,349
Finally, Tristan stood up.

998
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:11,289
'It's time I went.

999
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:14,530
Thank you for a really nice evening.

1000
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,690
You're a good listener.'

1001
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,310
'So are you.'

1002
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,119
'Shall I see you tomorrow?' he asked.

1003
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,990
'Yes, I was thinking of coming on one of your
trips.

1004
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,849
Where are you going in the morning?' asked
Anna.

1005
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:31,890
'Out past Skellig and round the rocks.'

1006
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,410
He took a step nearer her.

1007
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,099
'It's a good trip.

1008
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:37,200
The boat leaves at ten.'

1009
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,609
'Fine.

1010
01:02:38,609 --> 01:02:42,620
I'll be there.'

1011
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:46,540
Maybe it was the wine, but he seemed to be
standing closer.

1012
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:52,900
He put his hands on her shoulders and kissed
her quite firmly on the lips.

1013
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,170
'Goodnight.

1014
01:02:54,170 --> 01:03:02,170
See you in the morning,' he said, and closed
the gate behind him.

1015
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,839
CHAPTER EIGHT

1016
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,960
On Wave Dancer

1017
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,650
When Anna woke the next morning, she forgot
that Stephen wasn't in bed next to her until

1018
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,660
she turned over to touch him.

1019
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,030
She looked at her watch - eight o'clock.

1020
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:24,520
He'd be on his way to the office now, probably
caught in traffic.

1021
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,119
Poor thing.

1022
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,900
She lay there for a while thinking about him
and wondering how much today would change

1023
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,730
their lives.

1024
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,849
'Coffee,' she thought.

1025
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:39,589
'And I think I'll go and get the newspaper.

1026
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:43,970
I can do the crossword before I go on the
trip.'

1027
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:49,880
On her way down to the shop, she started thinking
about last night's dinner with Tristan.

1028
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,339
She wondered if today they'd be as easy with
each other as they'd been last night.

1029
01:03:55,339 --> 01:03:57,049
The woman in the shop said, 'Morning.

1030
01:03:57,049 --> 01:04:00,779
Did you have a nice dinner last night?'

1031
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:05,970
'Yes, thank you,' said Anna in a surprised
voice.

1032
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:10,720
The woman continued, 'I saw you when I was
walking my dog.

1033
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,660
You can't keep anything secret in this place
for long!'

1034
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,340
Anna laughed.

1035
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:19,920
'I must remember that,' she thought.

1036
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:26,670
Back home, she tried the crossword but it
was too difficult, so she left it for later.

1037
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,480
She could see Tristan's boat below with Tristan
on board.

1038
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,720
She noticed there was more movement on the
sea today.

1039
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,839
It wasn't rough but the boats were moving
up and down a little.

1040
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:44,410
She went inside to collect her backpack from
the cottage and went down to the harbour.

1041
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,540
Tristan was by the boat, talking to another
man.

1042
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:50,750
'Morning, Anna,' said Tristan.

1043
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,349
'Everything OK?

1044
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:55,619
This is Gary - he works with me on the boat
trips.

1045
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:59,720
Anna's staying at Dolphin Cottage,' he said
to Gary.

1046
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,569
They smiled at each other.

1047
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:06,920
Gary looked at her quite closely and she wondered
if they'd been talking about her when she

1048
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
arrived.

1049
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,210
'I haven't got a ticket or anything for this
trip,' said Anna.

1050
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,640
'Do I need one?'

1051
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,980
'No,' replied Gary.

1052
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,430
'You pay on the boat.

1053
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,380
Have you got a jacket or something with you?

1054
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,119
You might need it today.

1055
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:26,910
We were just saying that the sea'll probably
be a bit rough on the other side of the island.'

1056
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:30,920
'The water comes over the boat in certain
places.

1057
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,549
Sit near the front on the right side if you
don't want to get wet,' Tristan added.

1058
01:05:35,549 --> 01:05:36,750
'Right.

1059
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,940
Thanks.'

1060
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:43,280
He jumped onto the boat and then turned to
help Anna.

1061
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,910
He held out his hand and took hers very firmly.

1062
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,430
He kept hold until she had sat down.

1063
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:54,000
Other people were now arriving and getting
on the boat.

1064
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,760
Most of them seemed to know Tristan.

1065
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,910
Perhaps they went on his trips often.

1066
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:05,920
Anna recognised one or two who she'd seen
on the beach or in the village somewhere.

1067
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:13,010
Everybody seemed very well-prepared - jackets,
extra sweaters, binoculars, cameras.

1068
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,619
Ready for a trans-Atlantic expedition, she
thought.

1069
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:21,380
Then she looked at Tristan and Gary in their
shorts and T-shirts and wondered which group

1070
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,350
had got it right.

1071
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:28,720
Tristan started explaining to everyone where
they were going and what they might see on

1072
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,720
the trip.

1073
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,360
This gave her a good chance to look at him
carefully.

1074
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:40,020
He told a few funny stories and the passengers
laughed in the right places.

1075
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,510
Anna found herself thinking how attractive
he was - and not just physically.

1076
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:49,550
He had an air of confidence about him that
she liked.

1077
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:54,420
But then, he must have felt Anna's eyes on
him because he turned towards her and she

1078
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,829
blushed!

1079
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:58,400
She could feel her cheeks going red!

1080
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,470
Just like a schoolgirl caught doing something
wrong!

1081
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:03,849
How embarrassing!

1082
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:09,100
As soon as they left the harbour, the sea
became much rougher but nobody seemed to be

1083
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,270
worried.

1084
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:15,080
In fact, it was quite fun trying to move your
body with the movement of the boat - a bit

1085
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,490
like riding a horse, Anna thought.

1086
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:24,540
Once or twice, when the boat went into a wave,
water came over the side, and again, people

1087
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,839
seemed to think it was all part of the fun.

1088
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,520
They passed the island and moved on towards
the rocks.

1089
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,760
From Polreath, you couldn't really see very
much beyond the island so Anna was surprised

1090
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:43,260
at the size of some of the rocks - almost
like mini-islands.

1091
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,630
Tristan took the boat close in and slowed
the engine.

1092
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:50,500
'There are very often seals around here.

1093
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:56,380
In fact, we might see some young ones - the
first ones are usually born around this time,'

1094
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,069
he said quietly.

1095
01:07:59,069 --> 01:08:01,690
'Look!' said a man at the back of the boat.

1096
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:05,849
'There are two in the water over there.'

1097
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:09,049
Everybody focused their binoculars where he
was pointing.

1098
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:15,390
The heads of two adult seals appeared and
then disappeared behind a wave.

1099
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:18,240
Someone tried to take a picture.

1100
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,200
Tristan took the boat in and out of the rocks.

1101
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,799
They managed to see some seals out of the
water - lying on rocks, almost sunbathing

1102
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:29,060
- but no young ones.

1103
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:34,009
They were about to turn for home when Gary
saw something white on the rocks just above

1104
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,009
the water.

1105
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:38,350
It was a very young seal.

1106
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:41,859
'Don't make too much noise,' said Tristan.

1107
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:46,710
'We don't want to frighten it, or worry its
Mum, wherever she is.

1108
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:49,380
This is the first one I've seen this year.

1109
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:53,100
I guess it's only a few days old.'

1110
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:59,339
Not many people on the boat had ever seen
a young seal before so they were really pleased.

1111
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:04,220
Anna thought how helpless it looked, all by
itself on the rock.

1112
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:09,359
And as if he knew what she was thinking, Tristan
said, 'The first few days are dangerous ones

1113
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,969
for the young.

1114
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:16,219
Some of the bigger seabirds attack them - they
go for their eyes.'

1115
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:21,330
The boat was moving up and down quite a lot
and it was difficult to stand.

1116
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:28,170
Suddenly, the boat was caught by a bigger
wave and an elderly woman fell sideways.

1117
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:32,410
In trying to save herself, she hit her arm
on the side.

1118
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:36,100
Immediately, people crowded round her, and
started talking:

1119
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,370
'Are you all right?'

1120
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,609
'Here, let's get you up onto a seat.'

1121
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,009
'Just sit quietly for a minute.

1122
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:45,750
What a nasty shock!'

1123
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:50,100
Tristan moved the boat out into deeper water,
away from the rocks.

1124
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,100
He looked at Anna and his eyes seemed to be
asking her 'Could you?'

1125
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,960
She went over to the woman.

1126
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,010
'Would you like me to look?'

1127
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:00,010
she said.

1128
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:01,610
'I'm a nurse.'

1129
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,270
'I'm all right,' she said.

1130
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:09,370
'I think I just hurt my arm, that's all.'

1131
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:13,510
Anna moved the woman and her husband up to
the front of the boat.

1132
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,860
She looked at the arm, which was quite red
and already beginning to get bigger.

1133
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:23,489
Very gently, she pressed and the woman made
a small sound.

1134
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:27,960
'Well, Mrs... er...' Anna began.

1135
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,100
'Taylor...

1136
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,630
Sheila,' the woman said.

1137
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:36,820
'Sheila, I don't think you've broken it, but
it'd be a good idea to have it X-rayed when

1138
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,140
we get back, just to make sure.'

1139
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,239
Anna looked up.

1140
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,380
'Tristan, where's the nearest place for that?'

1141
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,690
'The Cottage Hospital in Kingham - it's not
far.

1142
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:50,350
I'll take you in the car, Mrs Taylor.'

1143
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:55,640
Anna found a bandage in the First Aid box
and tied Mrs Taylor's arm up.

1144
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,130
The poor old woman had gone a bit white now
and was shaking.

1145
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,590
Someone passed her a cup of tea.

1146
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:07,960
I was right, thought Anna, they came prepared
for anything!

1147
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:13,280
By the time they reached Polreath, Mrs Taylor
looked better but her arm was clearly giving

1148
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,659
her a lot of pain.

1149
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:21,280
Fortunately, Tristan's car was near the harbour
and Mr and Mrs Taylor got in the back.

1150
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,320
'Would you like me to come too?' asked Anna.

1151
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,840
'Please,' said Tristan.

1152
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,710
He looked more worried than anybody.

1153
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:34,420
I wonder if he's insured for accidents, she
thought.

1154
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:39,650
I suppose something like this is not good
for his business.

1155
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:43,590
The X-ray showed bruising but the arm wasn't
broken.

1156
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:48,530
'I'm really sorry, Mrs Taylor,' said Tristan.

1157
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:51,530
'It's not your fault,' she replied.

1158
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:54,139
'You're not responsible for the sea.

1159
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:56,699
I shouldn't have been standing up.'

1160
01:11:56,699 --> 01:11:59,310
'Well, let's go back home.

1161
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,830
I'll buy everyone a drink when we get back.

1162
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,730
I think we all need one,' Tristan said.

1163
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:11,280
The Taylors didn't want a drink, so Tristan
and Anna left them at their hotel.

1164
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,570
'Your arm will hurt a lot tonight,' said Anna.

1165
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:18,750
'So take some aspirins before you go to bed
- they'll help with the pain.'

1166
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,409
'Thank you for your help,' said Mr Taylor.

1167
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:26,210
'Well probably see you around somewhere in
the next day or two.'

1168
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:31,280
'Poor old thing,' said Anna, drinking her
beer in the Fisherman's Arms.

1169
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,260
'She was lucky today.

1170
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,400
But I don't think she'll be doing much for
the next couple of days.

1171
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,449
That arm'll hurt for a bit.'

1172
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:44,120
'I was lucky,' replied Tristan, with a shake
of the head.

1173
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:49,230
'It's fortunate she was so nice about it - someone
different might have complained and spread

1174
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:51,159
the word about.

1175
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:55,739
People would soon begin to think I was a bit
careless with my passengers, and there are

1176
01:12:55,739 --> 01:13:00,560
one or two people in this village who would
be quite happy to see me lose business.'

1177
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,560
'Really?

1178
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,560
Why?'

1179
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,090
asked Anna.

1180
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:08,880
'Oh, jealousy, I suppose,' Tristan replied.

1181
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,540
'It's a small place, Polreath; feelings get
a bit strong sometimes.'

1182
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:16,560
'Have they got reason to be jealous?'

1183
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,040
Anna asked, remembering the conversation that
she and Stephen had heard in the bar the other

1184
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,040
day.

1185
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:27,120
'Well,' he laughed, 'I'm not sure I'm the
best person to answer that!

1186
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,520
You should ask them!

1187
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,750
People might think I've got a good life - what
with the boat and two cottages.'

1188
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,389
'And maybe a third cottage to come?'

1189
01:13:37,389 --> 01:13:38,400
Anna added.

1190
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,760
'Why do you say that?'

1191
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,260
Tristan asked sharply.

1192
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,760
'Sorry, I shouldn't have.

1193
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:50,050
I was just repeating something we heard about
you in here the other day,' Anna said, wishing

1194
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,440
she hadn't asked.

1195
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,900
'A guy called Jack was saying that you were
interested in another cottage in the village.'

1196
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,520
'Ah ha, Jack!

1197
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,020
There you are, you see.

1198
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:04,170
The stories that spread in a small village!'

1199
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:05,679
Tristan looked a bit angry.

1200
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,989
'Look, I'm sorry,' Anna said quickly.

1201
01:14:08,989 --> 01:14:11,050
'It's none of my business.

1202
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,120
Shall we change the subject?

1203
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:19,620
I meant to say earlier how much I enjoyed
the trip - except for the accident, of course.

1204
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,850
You made it interesting for everyone.'

1205
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,490
'Thanks.'

1206
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:27,360
There was a bit of an uncomfortable silence.

1207
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,489
Tristan stared into his beer and then said,
'I don't want another cottage.

1208
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:38,199
I was interested in the price because it's
more or less the same size as Dolphin Cottage.

1209
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:43,320
And I wanted to know how much I might be able
to sell that for.'

1210
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,969
'You want to sell Dolphin Cottage?' said Anna
in complete surprise.

1211
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:49,000
'Oh don't!

1212
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,650
It's too lovely to lose.'

1213
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:58,679
'I don't really know whether I want to or
not - I might need to, to get some money.

1214
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:02,370
It's got some rather mixed memories for me
- Jill, you know.

1215
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:07,980
And as you now understand, owning two places
can cause bad feeling.

1216
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,420
'Anyway, I've got to go.

1217
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:15,630
Believe it or not, I've got another trip to
do - a quick one-hour up the coast.'

1218
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,540
He waited a second or two before continuing.

1219
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:24,680
'But I was wondering, if you're not doing
anything tonight, can I buy you dinner - to

1220
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:29,630
thank you for dinner last night, and for Mrs
Taylor?'

1221
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:33,550
He looked at her carefully to see what she
would say.

1222
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:37,889
Would she think he was just being friendly
or more than that?

1223
01:15:37,889 --> 01:15:42,750
He meant it to be friendly, but he had an
awful feeling he wanted more.

1224
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,130
'Thank you.

1225
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:48,060
I'd like that,' she said returning his look.

1226
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:53,890
'I thought we could drive to a place in the
next village - it'd be a change.

1227
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:56,200
Meet in the car park at eight?'

1228
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,530
'Fine.

1229
01:15:57,530 --> 01:16:00,300
Have a safe trip this afternoon!'

1230
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:06,840
She ordered a coffee and sat there, wondering
what she was doing, and feeling guilty because

1231
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:13,220
she hadn't really thought about Stephen all
day.

1232
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:14,840
CHAPTER NINE

1233
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,920
Dinner at Gino's

1234
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:23,840
'Someone's going to buy the company,' said
Stephen on the phone from London.

1235
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,580
And then he said something about it being
'the best thing all round'.

1236
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:33,370
He sounded quite cheerful, said he would be
with her in the morning and that he missed

1237
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,830
her.

1238
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:39,400
Anna felt, in all honesty, that she couldn't
say the same thing back to him.

1239
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,520
Today had been so full of other things that
she hadn't really missed him.

1240
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:51,719
So all she said to him was, 'It'll be lovely
to see you for breakfast' - which was true,

1241
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:57,030
it would be lovely - Stephen was the most
important person in her life.

1242
01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:01,480
But she didn't say anything about going out
with Tristan.

1243
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:06,840
She put on a bright red dress that she'd had
for years but which always made her feel great,

1244
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,810
especially when she had a suntan, and gave
her hair a quick brush.

1245
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,159
She was excited about tonight.

1246
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,320
It was a great feeling getting ready to go
out with another man.

1247
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:22,929
It reminded her of how she felt before she
met Stephen.

1248
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:26,080
She walked slowly up the hill to the car park.

1249
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:31,770
'Hey, you look nice,' said Anna when she saw
Tristan.

1250
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:38,120
Instead of his usual shorts and T-shirt Tristan
was wearing trousers and a green short-sleeved

1251
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,120
shirt.

1252
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,920
'We're not going anywhere expensive, are we?'

1253
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,239
she asked.

1254
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:47,409
'No, just an Italian restaurant in St Leven,
not far.

1255
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:49,820
And you look wonderful!'

1256
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:50,840
Tristan replied.

1257
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,659
'Shall we go?'

1258
01:17:53,659 --> 01:17:55,330
Tristan's car smelt of fish.

1259
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,929
The whole of the back was full of nets.

1260
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:03,280
'Does it smell?' he asked when he saw Anna's
face.

1261
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,010
'It just seems normal to me.'

1262
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:10,810
'Well, I'm just glad we're not going far,'
laughed Anna.

1263
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:11,810
'Sorry.

1264
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,560
Actually, all I can smell is your perfume.

1265
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,530
Have you heard from Stephen?' asked Tristan.

1266
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:21,389
'Yes, he just rang,' replied Anna.

1267
01:18:21,389 --> 01:18:23,150
'He seemed fine.

1268
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:25,620
He said he'd be back tomorrow for breakfast.'

1269
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,050
'Is he driving down overnight, then?' asked
Tristan.

1270
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,409
'Yes, I guess so.

1271
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:34,170
He likes night driving.'

1272
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:37,570
It took about fifteen minutes to get to St
Leven.

1273
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:41,620
Anna suggested going for a walk round the
harbour first.

1274
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:45,530
She needed a bit of fresh air after the fishy
car.

1275
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:50,469
The harbour was bigger than Polreath and so
were the fishing boats.

1276
01:18:50,469 --> 01:18:55,600
One or two of the men on board said hello
to Tristan and gave Anna a quick look.

1277
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,020
'I get the feeling I'm being noticed,' Anna
thought.

1278
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:06,310
'I wonder if that woman in the shop in Polreath
is going to tell me tomorrow what I was doing

1279
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,310
tonight!'

1280
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:11,090
'What are you smiling at?' asked Tristan.

1281
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:17,560
'I was just thinking how hard it would be
to keep anything secret down here,' Anna replied.

1282
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,920
'True.

1283
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,500
Were you thinking about anything in particular?'
he asked, looking at her.

1284
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,290
'No,' she lied.

1285
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,920
'Let's go and eat.

1286
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,949
I'm really hungry.'

1287
01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:34,590
Gino's restaurant was away from the sea, in
a narrow street.

1288
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:38,420
They walked through the restaurant to the
garden at the back where there were a number

1289
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:41,340
of tables gathered around a pizza oven.

1290
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:46,580
Gino was putting in and taking out the pizzas
from the oven with a long wooden thing.

1291
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,719
'Hello, Tristan.

1292
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:50,000
Good to see you.

1293
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,850
How are you?' said Gino.

1294
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:57,530
Tristan and Anna sat at the only free table
and ordered two pizza margheritas and the

1295
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,780
house wine.

1296
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:04,730
They began talking about Italy, where they
had both been, and then the difficulty of

1297
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:08,130
living away from your own country.

1298
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,790
Tristan said it was not 'the country' that
was important for him but simply the place

1299
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:15,580
where you were - the town, the village.

1300
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:21,199
'And that's why Jill and I can never work
as a couple.

1301
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,570
Neither of us is willing to leave the place
where we want to be.

1302
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:30,600
We spoke on the phone earlier today and decided
to be realistic.

1303
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,750
We haven't really got a future together.

1304
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,080
I'm sure we'll try to remain friends.

1305
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,880
There was a lot between us and we had good
laughs.

1306
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,389
But everybody says that kind of thing when
their relationship breaks up.'

1307
01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:50,389
'I'm sorry it didn't work out for you,' said
Anna.

1308
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:57,300
'Actually, you helped me to take the decision,'
said Tristan, and looked across at Anna to

1309
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,790
see what she would do.

1310
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:03,000
She was looking directly at him so he continued.

1311
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:10,530
'This is going to sound like a Hollywood movie
but... you've woken me up.'

1312
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,969
Tristan reached across the table and took
her hand.

1313
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:18,179
'I was feeling really sorry for myself and
then you and Stephen arrived.'

1314
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:23,030
'Yes, me and Stephen!

1315
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,510
Anna repeated.

1316
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:31,050
And yes, it did sound like a film, she thought,
but she wanted him to continue.

1317
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:34,739
'What's so special about me and Stephen?

1318
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:40,770
You must meet hundreds of visitors every year,
and they probably all fall in love with Polreath,

1319
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,320
and half of them with you too.'

1320
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,100
'I don't know why.

1321
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:50,510
I just know I wanted to get to know you both
better.

1322
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:54,010
Maybe you arrived at the right time, I don't
know.

1323
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:59,159
Anyway, whatever it is, I feel clearer about
some things.'

1324
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,960
'I don't,' thought Anna.

1325
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,480
'I feel confused.

1326
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,300
Why is he holding my hand?

1327
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,050
Would he be holding Stephen's hand too if
he was here?'

1328
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:15,000
'But now there's another problem,' he went
on.

1329
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,469
'I think we're attracted to one another.'

1330
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:20,330
Anna pulled her hand away.

1331
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,699
How could he say that!

1332
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:27,920
He'd just been talking about her and Stephen
and now he was saying this.

1333
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,420
How could he?

1334
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,870
Five minutes ago, he'd been talking about
breaking up with Jill.

1335
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,300
That can't have been easy to do.

1336
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,230
And here he was, saying he was attracted to
her.

1337
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:44,679
It sounded like throwing off one pair of shoes
and trying on a new pair.

1338
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:46,830
What was he doing?

1339
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:47,900
'I'm sorry.

1340
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,650
I shouldn't have said that.'

1341
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,860
'No, you shouldn't,' said Anna.

1342
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,950
'But it's true, isn't it?'

1343
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,250
Tristan said softly.

1344
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,370
'Yes.'

1345
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:03,200
And she picked up her glass to hide her confusion.

1346
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,480
'But I don't intend to do anything about it.

1347
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,350
I'm with Stephen and we're happy.

1348
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,130
And you've confused me.'

1349
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:15,469
'Same here,' he said.

1350
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:17,400
He took hold of her hand again.

1351
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:23,240
'I know you're happy with Stephen - I could
see it the first day you were here.

1352
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:28,700
I just thought it was better to bring everything
out into the open.

1353
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:33,700
Sometimes if you don't talk about things they
become even more important.'

1354
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:37,960
'Maybe some things are better left unsaid.

1355
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:43,400
Stephen's coming back tomorrow and in three
weeks I'll have disappeared out of your life.

1356
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:48,170
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing anymore,'
Anna said.

1357
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:51,650
'It's not a crime to find someone attractive,
is it?' he said.

1358
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,310
'No, it's not.

1359
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:57,110
In fact, it's great in a way.

1360
01:23:57,110 --> 01:24:02,190
But I've been with Stephen for ten years and
this is the first time I've been in this situation.

1361
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,360
I don't know what to do.

1362
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:09,300
And by the way, Gino is looking at us.

1363
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,250
Let's talk about something else, please.'

1364
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,880
And they did.

1365
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,230
They talked about food and they slowly relaxed.

1366
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:20,860
But all the time Anna was thinking.

1367
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:28,239
She did find him attractive and if there were
no Stephen, who knows what might happen.

1368
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,660
Recently she had felt excluded sometimes by
Stephen.

1369
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:36,750
He had seemed to be in a world of his own,
so it was wonderful to be the centre of Tristan's

1370
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,680
attention.

1371
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,850
Tristan's thoughts were going along similar
lines.

1372
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:45,389
He didn't want to hurt anybody.

1373
01:24:45,389 --> 01:24:47,990
Maybe he should have kept his mouth shut.

1374
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:53,090
That was his problem - he always had to say
what he was thinking, didn't he?

1375
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:57,350
It had got him into trouble more than once
in the past.

1376
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:02,699
Anna was a warm, open, lively woman - and
he felt good when he was with her.

1377
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:08,250
But, as she said, she would be leaving in
three weeks, so there was no point in letting

1378
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,940
things go any further.

1379
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,780
They got up to leave and Gino came over.

1380
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:19,570
'Cheerio, my friend,' he said, and my friend's
friend,' he said looking at Anna.

1381
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:21,670
'Hope to see you again.

1382
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,100
Be good!'

1383
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:30,230
'Mmm, an interesting choice of words,' thought
Tristan as they stepped out into the street.

1384
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:36,090
'Gosh, Tristan, the smell of fish in your
car is quite powerful.

1385
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:40,290
We'll have to drive with the windows open,'
said Anna.

1386
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:44,450
Sitting in the car on the way back to Polreath
was not very easy.

1387
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:47,940
And it wasn't just because of the fishy smell.

1388
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:52,090
They were both very conscious of each other
sitting close by.

1389
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,880
Tristan parked the car above the village and
they got out.

1390
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,400
'Let's just walk for a bit,' said Anna.

1391
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,630
'I don't want to go back to the cottage yet.'

1392
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:05,760
They took the path along the top of the cliffs.

1393
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,280
It was dark but the moon was bright enough
so there was no danger of them walking over

1394
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,869
the edge.

1395
01:26:11,869 --> 01:26:17,150
In places, the path was quite narrow where
it passed between bushes and Anna walked in

1396
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,690
front.

1397
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:23,250
Being in front made her feel as if she was
in charge of the situation.

1398
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:29,420
Then she heard something move just ahead,
an animal probably, and she stopped suddenly.

1399
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,480
Tristan walked into the back of her.

1400
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,550
She jumped and half turned round.

1401
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:37,690
They were standing so close.

1402
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,510
She reached up and touched his face with her
finger.

1403
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:46,420
He put his arms round her and they kissed,
long and hard.

1404
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:49,199
Anna pulled away from him.

1405
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:55,159
'So much for not letting things go any further,'
said Tristan softly.

1406
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:59,150
'I think I knew that was going to happen,'
said Anna.

1407
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:02,219
The sense of his body was still with her.

1408
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:08,180
'I know this might sound odd, but I needed
that!'

1409
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:09,230
Tristan smiled.

1410
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:14,180
'So did I - and I need more.'

1411
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:18,260
They kissed again but this time more lightly.

1412
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:23,469
It was almost as if a spell had been broken,
and a deep and exciting kiss had been enough

1413
01:27:23,469 --> 01:27:24,680
for the moment.

1414
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:29,730
'Anna, I think you're wonderful,' he said,
trying to keep his voice light.

1415
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:35,170
'I wish we were free to do whatever we want,
but we're not.

1416
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:39,670
At least, I'll still be able to look Stephen
in the eye when I see him tomorrow.'

1417
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:42,119
'I hope I can, too.

1418
01:27:42,119 --> 01:27:46,619
Do you think we'd better go before anything
else happens?

1419
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:51,429
We don't need to say anything to Stephen,
either of us, do we?'

1420
01:27:51,429 --> 01:27:55,130
'No, why should we?' he replied.

1421
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,280
'Nothing's happened.'

1422
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:04,800
But they both knew something had.

1423
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,420
CHAPTER TEN

1424
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,530
Stephen's return

1425
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:14,290
Anna woke up because she felt something on
her cheek.

1426
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,619
She pushed it away.

1427
01:28:15,619 --> 01:28:16,619
'Ouch!

1428
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:18,860
That's my nose!'

1429
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,590
Stephen cried.

1430
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:25,820
She opened her eyes and there was Stephen
bending over her and rubbing his nose where

1431
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,600
she'd hit it.

1432
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,320
'Hello, love,' said Anna.

1433
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,380
'You're back.

1434
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,060
What time is it?'

1435
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,060
'Seven.

1436
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,070
Sorry to wake you but you looked so lovely
lying there.

1437
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:43,469
I'll go and make some coffee and bring it
up.

1438
01:28:43,469 --> 01:28:45,780
It's a beautiful morning.'

1439
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:52,040
Anna lay there, listening to Stephen downstairs,
and remembering the night before.

1440
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,929
She felt good.

1441
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:58,980
She'd had an 'adventure' and she had escaped.

1442
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:04,060
Now Stephen was back and everything would
be back to normal.

1443
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:09,680
He sat on the bed drinking coffee and told
her about the agency meeting.

1444
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:14,270
Everyone had all agreed in the end that the
sale of the company was the best thing.

1445
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:18,889
The buyers had been honest about the future
and said there were no guarantees of people

1446
01:29:18,889 --> 01:29:20,250
keeping their jobs.

1447
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:25,070
There would have to be some restructuring
- which, according to Stephen, meant a lot

1448
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:27,820
of people losing their jobs.

1449
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:33,380
'So, we're going to have a few months without
knowing whether I'll be one of the lucky ones,'

1450
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,860
said Stephen.

1451
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:39,250
'Well, you look very cheerful about it,' replied
Anna.

1452
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,929
'There's nothing I can do.

1453
01:29:40,929 --> 01:29:42,429
It's out of my hands.

1454
01:29:42,429 --> 01:29:44,980
So to hell with it all, for the moment.

1455
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:49,820
I don't even know if I want to keep the job
anyway,' Stephen said as he started to get

1456
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:50,820
undressed.

1457
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:56,510
'I'm going to have a shower, and then maybe
have a few hours' sleep.'

1458
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:58,640
Anna was surprised.

1459
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,090
Stephen didn't really seem worried about it
all.

1460
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:02,360
'How amazing!

1461
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:06,640
Perhaps he is changing,' she thought.

1462
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,760
She decided to get up.

1463
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,290
She didn't feel like lying in bed waiting
for Stephen.

1464
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:14,790
It was better to be active.

1465
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:20,920
She made another cup of coffee and stood outside
listening to the morning sounds.

1466
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:25,690
Tristan was on his boat, doing something with
a fishing net.

1467
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:28,969
'Probably one of the smelly ones from the
car,' she thought.

1468
01:30:28,969 --> 01:30:33,950
How did she feel about him this morning?

1469
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:38,909
Quite relaxed, she thought, although something
was making her heart beat faster.

1470
01:30:38,909 --> 01:30:46,469
'Must be the coffee,' she said to herself,
and went inside to get some breakfast.

1471
01:30:46,469 --> 01:30:48,969
'Did you have a good evening with Tristan?'

1472
01:30:48,969 --> 01:30:51,280
Stephen was sitting at the kitchen table.

1473
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,969
He stood up and put his arms round Anna.

1474
01:30:53,969 --> 01:31:01,150
'Mm, yes, I did,' said Anna, wondering for
a moment which evening he was talking about.

1475
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:03,050
'Yes, it was fun.

1476
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:08,240
He's very good to be with - and very open
about everything, isn't he?

1477
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,710
It doesn't seem to worry him that he's only
just met us.

1478
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:17,730
Anyway, what are you doing - I thought you
were going to have a bit of sleep?'

1479
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:20,300
'Changed my mind,' replied Stephen.

1480
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:24,969
'The bed seemed empty, and I don't want to
waste the day sleeping.

1481
01:31:24,969 --> 01:31:27,190
I want to start my holiday again.

1482
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,090
Do you feel like going surfing later?

1483
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:35,790
If we walk over there, you can tell me what
you've been doing while I've been away.'

1484
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:40,590
Anna had already decided that she was going
to tell him about last night's dinner.

1485
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:46,380
She knew if she didn't, he was sure to hear
about it from someone else - half the population

1486
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,150
of Polreath and St Leven probably.

1487
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:54,139
So, as they walked over to the surf beach,
she told him all about going on the boat out

1488
01:31:54,139 --> 01:32:00,750
to the rocks, and the accident and about Gino's,
and even about Tristan and Jill splitting

1489
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,150
up.

1490
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:05,440
But she missed out the walk at the end of
the evening.

1491
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,360
She could feel Stephen looking at her once
or twice.

1492
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,350
'Well, you have been busy,' he said thoughtfully.

1493
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:16,080
She seemed to have been perfectly happy without
him.

1494
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,420
'You obviously enjoyed it all.

1495
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,210
You like Tristan, don't you?'

1496
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:23,929
'Yes - don't you?'

1497
01:32:23,929 --> 01:32:25,530
she replied.

1498
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:30,900
'Yes, at least, what I know of him,' said
Stephen slowly.

1499
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:36,320
'I like the way he lives and the way he seems
to know what makes him happy.

1500
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,010
That's quite rare.'

1501
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:42,730
Anna waited; she realised that Stephen hadn't
finished.

1502
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:49,280
'Did he tell you he went to university - he
got a degree in civil engineering?

1503
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,760
He was offered a good job, too, but he didn't
take it.

1504
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,409
He wanted to come back to Polreath instead.

1505
01:32:55,409 --> 01:33:01,350
He could have been really successful by now
- probably a manager with a high salary.

1506
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:05,290
But he knew that wasn't really for him,' Stephen
paused.

1507
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:08,940
Now it was Anna's turn to look at him.

1508
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:13,420
'What are you saying?' asked Anna.

1509
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:20,020
'Nothing really - just that I think he made
the right decision - for him,' Stephen said.

1510
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:25,090
'Are you trying to tell me you feel you've
made the wrong decision?

1511
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:30,630
I always thought you loved the advertising
world - and life in the city,' said Anna.

1512
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:32,320
'I do...

1513
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,020
I did.'

1514
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,949
Stephen stopped for a moment.

1515
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:40,600
All I'm saying is I think I've reached a crossroads
in my life.

1516
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,840
I feel it's time for a change of direction.

1517
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,980
Maybe it's a mid-life crisis - I don't know.'

1518
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:50,870
'You're too young for a mid-life crisis,'
replied Anna.

1519
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:54,920
'Have you got any ideas about what you'd like
to do, then?'

1520
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:00,619
'One or two but they're still just ideas,
so I don't really want to talk about them

1521
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:01,619
yet.'

1522
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:04,889
'I've heard that before,' thought Anna.

1523
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:08,989
Stephen continued, 'I need time to think more.

1524
01:34:08,989 --> 01:34:10,060
Everything's happened so quickly'

1525
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,460
'Not that quickly, actually,' she said.

1526
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:17,000
'You've seemed different the last few weeks.

1527
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,989
I think this has been coming for a while.'

1528
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:21,659
'You're probably right.

1529
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:24,420
But don't push me to say more at the moment,
will you?

1530
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:27,090
I need time.'

1531
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:31,500
They walked on in silence, busy with their
own thoughts.

1532
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,739
Anna wasn't surprised by what Stephen had
said.

1533
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:39,130
She just hoped he'd talk to her more before
taking any big decisions.

1534
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:43,960
After all, it affected her life, too.

1535
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,949
The surf beach was busy when they got there.

1536
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:53,320
'I'm ready for this,' said Stephen, 'after
the last forty-eight hours, I need action.'

1537
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:57,030
They went to the beach shop and hired surfboards.

1538
01:34:57,030 --> 01:35:01,000
Neither of them felt like having a lesson
- they wanted to try it themselves first.

1539
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,389
They swam out with the boards to just beyond
the point where the waves were starting.

1540
01:35:06,389 --> 01:35:09,699
Then they watched to see what other people
did.

1541
01:35:09,699 --> 01:35:11,949
Timing was the important thing.

1542
01:35:11,949 --> 01:35:15,540
You had to catch the right wave at exactly
the right time.

1543
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:19,640
If you missed it, there was nothing to carry
you in towards the beach.

1544
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,850
You had to try again, wait for the next suitable
wave.

1545
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,040
It was fun.

1546
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:28,290
They couldn't really do it well, but they
enjoyed trying.

1547
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:33,360
Stephen did manage to stand up on his board
for about ten seconds but Anna was perfectly

1548
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,199
happy lying down on the board, surfing in
on her stomach.

1549
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:40,250
'I've had enough,' shouted Anna.

1550
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:43,909
'I'm giving up for the moment.'

1551
01:35:43,909 --> 01:35:47,219
She lay on the sand and let the sun warm her.

1552
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,190
Then she sat up to watch Stephen.

1553
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:51,790
He was doing quite well.

1554
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:54,619
But then he often did do well at sport.

1555
01:35:54,619 --> 01:35:56,970
She could see he wanted to be good at this.

1556
01:35:56,970 --> 01:36:02,360
'I enjoyed that,' said Stephen, lying down
on the beach beside her.

1557
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:06,969
'When you get it right, it's a great feeling!'

1558
01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:10,560
Turning over, he put his cold, wet hands on
Anna's stomach.

1559
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,560
'Ohhhh!

1560
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,810
You horror!

1561
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,810
Your hands are freezing!'

1562
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:18,900
He laughed, and pulled her to her feet.

1563
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,340
'Time for lunch.

1564
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,280
I could eat a horse.'

1565
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,370
They carried their surfboards to the open-air
cafe and 'parked' them next to some others.

1566
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:33,790
They had burgers and French fries with lots
of ketchup, and enjoyed every mouthful of

1567
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:34,790
it.

1568
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:40,110
'God, that was wonderful - just what I needed,'
said Stephen.

1569
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:41,580
'OK.

1570
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,350
What do you want to do now, then?

1571
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,750
I'd quite like to go back to the cottage.

1572
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,980
My sleepless night is catching up with me.

1573
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:50,280
I'm beginning to feel really tired.'

1574
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,270
'That's fine with me.

1575
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:57,290
I'm very happy sitting in the front garden
watching the world.

1576
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:05,230
I've got yesterday's crossword to finish,
too.'

1577
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:07,000
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1578
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,030
Back to normal

1579
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:13,350
Stephen went upstairs for a rest when they
got home.

1580
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:16,699
He asked Anna to wake him in a couple of hours.

1581
01:37:16,699 --> 01:37:23,920
She took her coffee, newspaper, book and suntan
cream into the garden and made herself comfortable.

1582
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,690
The sun felt good on her skin.

1583
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:32,030
She felt totally happy and couldn't imagine
ever wanting anything more.

1584
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:37,530
'It'd probably be better,' she thought, 'if
we didn't see Tristan today.

1585
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:41,199
Just give me time to get myself in balance
again.

1586
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:46,250
It seems as if that man is having an interesting
effect on both Stephen and me.

1587
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:51,840
I think Stephen knows I'm attracted to him,
and Stephen obviously likes him too.'

1588
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:57,210
At about five o'clock, she took a cup of tea
to Stephen to wake him up.

1589
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:59,990
He was fast asleep.

1590
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:02,110
'Teatime,' she whispered in his ear.

1591
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:06,950
He opened one eye and stared at her standing
there in her swimsuit.

1592
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:12,200
'How nice to be woken up by a half-naked woman
with a cup of tea.

1593
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:17,219
Why don't you join me in here, it's lovely.'

1594
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:20,030
She got in and they made love.

1595
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:26,250
They knew each other so well - it was all
so familiar, not passionate but comfortable

1596
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,790
and loving.

1597
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:31,890
'I'd like to stay here forever,' said Stephen.

1598
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:34,100
'What, in bed?'

1599
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:37,790
'No, in Polreath,' he laughed.

1600
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:45,980
'It suits us both - you look wonderful and
I feel better than I have for months.'

1601
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:49,380
'You said the same last year when we were
in Greece - remember?'

1602
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:53,130
'Did I?' said Stephen, getting out of bed.

1603
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:58,700
'Oh well, this is different, I think.'

1604
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:03,830
It was late afternoon and they went down to
the beach for a lazy swim.

1605
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:09,389
They called at the shop and sure enough, the
woman said, 'What did you think of Gino's

1606
01:39:09,389 --> 01:39:10,850
then, Mrs Martins?'

1607
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:15,949
'I knew it,' thought Anna, 'I knew she would
say something.

1608
01:39:15,949 --> 01:39:21,060
It's a good thing I told Stephen or I'd be
in trouble now.'

1609
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:25,280
She answered the woman in her sweetest voice.

1610
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:28,630
Outside the shop, Stephen suggested going
for a drink.

1611
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,900
'No, let's go back home.'

1612
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:35,320
Anna was surprised to find she felt bad about
the woman's comments.

1613
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:40,690
In any case, she didn't think she wanted to
meet Tristan at the moment.

1614
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:43,940
They spent a pleasant evening at home.

1615
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:49,030
Stephen cooked an amazing fish pie, and they
ate outside even though the evening was not

1616
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:51,280
quite as warm as before.

1617
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,110
'I'd like a quick beer in the pub before bedtime.

1618
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:55,349
Do you want to come?' asked Stephen.

1619
01:39:55,349 --> 01:39:59,250
'No, I'll stay here.

1620
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,909
You won't be long, will you?'

1621
01:40:01,909 --> 01:40:05,110
Ten minutes after Stephen left, the phone
rang.

1622
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:11,880
'If that's anybody from London from Stephen's
office, I'll probably shout at them,' thought

1623
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,290
Anna as she stood up.

1624
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:16,500
'Why don't they leave him alone?'

1625
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,500
'Hello!'

1626
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,670
she said very roughly.

1627
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:19,719
'Hello.

1628
01:40:19,719 --> 01:40:22,489
God, you sound angry!'

1629
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:23,920
It was Tristan.

1630
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,469
'Oh hello, Tristan.

1631
01:40:26,469 --> 01:40:29,780
Sorry, I thought it was going to be someone
else.

1632
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,780
Sorry.

1633
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:31,780
What...

1634
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:33,739
I mean, why...?'

1635
01:40:33,739 --> 01:40:36,280
and she didn't know how to finish.

1636
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,969
'You mean why am I ringing?'

1637
01:40:38,969 --> 01:40:40,860
Tristan finished her question for her.

1638
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:47,360
'Well, I saw Stephen going into the Fisherman's
Arms so I thought I'd just check to see if

1639
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,790
you... if everything's OK.'

1640
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:53,820
'Yes, I think so,' she said.

1641
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:55,030
'Stephen's happy to be back.

1642
01:40:55,030 --> 01:41:00,270
In fact, I thought when the phone rang it
was going to be someone about his work - that's

1643
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:01,730
why I sounded angry.

1644
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:04,810
Is everything OK with you?'

1645
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:06,040
'Yes, fine.'

1646
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,270
A pause.

1647
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:12,380
'The other reason I rang was to remind you
that there's another trip to Skellig tomorrow

1648
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,940
morning if you're interested.

1649
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:18,880
It'd be nice to see you, both of you, I think.'

1650
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,260
Tristan sounded a bit embarrassed.

1651
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:23,260
'Right.

1652
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:27,160
We'll probably come - I'll mention it to Stephen
when he gets back.

1653
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:30,590
What's the weather forecast for tomorrow?'
asked Anna.

1654
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,400
'I thought it was a bit cooler tonight.

1655
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,860
It's not going to change, is it?'

1656
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,810
'No, not yet,' he replied.

1657
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:41,460
'We've got the good weather for a bit longer,
so they say.'

1658
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,400
'Look, Tristan.

1659
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:46,800
Why don't you go and join Stephen in the bar?

1660
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:51,730
He'd like to see you, I know, and it might
be a good idea to see him without me around

1661
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:54,140
for the first time since we...

1662
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:57,830
you know...' and again, Anna couldn't finish.

1663
01:41:57,830 --> 01:42:02,969
'Mm, that's probably a good idea,' said Tristan
brightly.

1664
01:42:02,969 --> 01:42:03,989
'Thanks.

1665
01:42:03,989 --> 01:42:06,580
I won't say anything about ringing you tonight.

1666
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:09,320
And I'll mention the trip to Skellig to him.

1667
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,320
OK?

1668
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,400
Goodnight, Anna.

1669
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,670
See you tomorrow, I hope.'

1670
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:19,590
Anna was pleased with herself for being so
strong-minded, but she was shaking a bit when

1671
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:21,760
she put the phone down.

1672
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,390
Then she thought it was quite funny, really.

1673
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:27,850
Last night with her - tonight with Stephen.

1674
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:32,240
Tristan was certainly being very equal in
sharing himself between them.

1675
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:40,750
She hoped the woman from the shop would see
them together!

1676
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,770
CHAPTER TWELVE

1677
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:45,580
Decision time

1678
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:49,890
The next day they went on Tristans trip to
Skellig.

1679
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:54,940
About fifty people lived on the island all
year, and there was one hotel and a few holiday

1680
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:56,830
cottages.

1681
01:42:56,830 --> 01:43:01,920
It took them about an hour to walk around
the island, which, as Tristan had said, did

1682
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,320
seem to have something special about it.

1683
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,570
It was difficult to say exactly what it was.

1684
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:11,139
Maybe all small islands had it.

1685
01:43:11,139 --> 01:43:14,699
The far side, away from the coast, was the
best.

1686
01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:20,320
There was nothing to be seen except the rocks
where Anna had been a few days ago.

1687
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,750
Just ocean, going on forever.

1688
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:29,230
After their walk, they sat on the beach and
discussed whether they could live there.

1689
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:33,900
This was a game they often played when they
went somewhere new.

1690
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:39,760
Stephen thought he could, if he had some work
to do, but Anna didn't think she'd like it.

1691
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:45,599
'I'd be worried, I might not like any of the
other forty-eight people living here.

1692
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:49,830
It's not many to choose from,' she said.

1693
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:54,530
About half an hour before the boat was leaving,
they saw Tristan walking over the beach towards

1694
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:56,260
them.

1695
01:43:56,260 --> 01:44:00,969
'It's a beautiful place, isn't it?' said Tristan,
sitting down with them.

1696
01:44:00,969 --> 01:44:04,139
'Yes,' replied Stephen.

1697
01:44:04,139 --> 01:44:08,840
'Stephen thinks he could live here,' said
Anna, 'but I'm quite sure I couldn't.'

1698
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:14,770
'Well that's good, because the islanders wouldn't
be too happy about outsiders moving in.

1699
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:19,489
It'd take about twenty years before you were
accepted.'

1700
01:44:19,489 --> 01:44:21,920
Tristan sat there for a few minutes.

1701
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,929
Being in Anna's company again that day had
affected him.

1702
01:44:24,929 --> 01:44:31,340
He remembered last night - the taste of her
lips, the smell of her perfume.

1703
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,860
He turned to look at them both and said,

1704
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:40,270
'Now, if you really want to live down here
how about buying Dolphin Cottage?'

1705
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:42,150
'Are you serious?'

1706
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,400
asked Stephen.

1707
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,469
'Why do you want to sell?'

1708
01:44:45,469 --> 01:44:50,080
'I'm going to have to buy a new boat for next
year,' said Tristan.

1709
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:55,409
'This one's OK at the moment, but if I'm serious
about making more of a business out of the

1710
01:44:55,409 --> 01:45:00,080
trips, I really need a better boat - and they
cost a lot.

1711
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,989
Selling the cottage would give me the money
I need.

1712
01:45:02,989 --> 01:45:07,199
But I'm not in any hurry to sell - I just
thought I'd throw it into the conversation

1713
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:10,780
- give you something to think about!'

1714
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,260
Tristan's face showed nothing of what he really
felt.

1715
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:19,400
'Wouldn't it be the same - you know, not being
accepted by the locals in Polreath?'

1716
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,680
Anna asked.

1717
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:26,290
'It would be less of a problem than on Skellig,
because there are already one or two outsiders

1718
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:28,930
living in the village,' explained Tristan.

1719
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:32,929
And of course Dolphin Cottage has been a holiday
place for a few years.

1720
01:45:32,929 --> 01:45:38,770
But it's true, we do have to watch it - you
know, make sure the villagers are not pushed

1721
01:45:38,770 --> 01:45:39,770
out.'

1722
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:44,540
'Hey, wait a minute,' said Stephen with a
smile.

1723
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:47,469
'This conversation is going too fast.

1724
01:45:47,469 --> 01:45:49,620
We live in London, Anna - remember?

1725
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:52,449
Your job's there, our friends are there.

1726
01:45:52,449 --> 01:45:55,970
I don't know about my job, but it's there
at the moment.

1727
01:45:55,970 --> 01:46:00,409
I know I said I was ready for a change but
I'm not sure if this is the one I was thinking

1728
01:46:00,409 --> 01:46:02,050
of.'

1729
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:09,489
Stephen's look to Anna said 'I'm interested
but we need to talk about it together - later.'

1730
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:14,370
On the journey back, nobody said anything
more about the cottage.

1731
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:18,950
Anna realised that the possibility of living
in Polreath excited her.

1732
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:24,050
She started thinking about what work opportunities
there were for nurses down here.

1733
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:29,610
She also wondered if Tristan really wanted
to sell to anyone or just to them as a way

1734
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:32,239
of keeping in touch with her.

1735
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:37,369
Maybe it was asking for trouble even to think
about it.

1736
01:46:37,369 --> 01:46:41,280
A wonderful holiday or a new way of life?

1737
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,900
That was on their minds for the next few days.

1738
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:49,869
For Stephen and Anna there were days when
they seemed to do nothing except eat, sleep,

1739
01:46:49,869 --> 01:46:52,520
read and lie in the sun.

1740
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:57,350
There were other days when they were more
active: Stephen did some more surfing and

1741
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:58,860
became quite good.

1742
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:05,270
Anna quietly, without telling anyone, found
out about jobs for nurses in the area - just

1743
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:07,030
in case.

1744
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:10,750
The two of them talked about the possibility
of buying the cottage.

1745
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:16,739
But if they did, would they keep it as a holiday
home or move there to live?

1746
01:47:16,739 --> 01:47:21,060
Stephen told Anna that after the sale of the
company, one of his hopes was that the new

1747
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:23,460
owners would not want to keep him.

1748
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:28,650
They couldn't make him leave, so they'd have
to offer him some money and he could then

1749
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:31,599
use that money to start again.

1750
01:47:31,599 --> 01:47:35,489
The idea of doing something in the Polreath
area attracted him.

1751
01:47:35,489 --> 01:47:39,610
'Can we afford to buy this place?' asked Anna.

1752
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:44,330
'Yes,' replied Stephen, 'if we sell the flat
in London.'

1753
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:46,170
'But what about work down here?'

1754
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:47,460
asked Anna.

1755
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,820
'You'd have to do something, we can't live
off one salary.'

1756
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,889
'I know.

1757
01:47:51,889 --> 01:47:55,119
That's what I've been thinking about.

1758
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:59,570
I want to see if I could work in advertising
down here.

1759
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:03,489
I'd even be interested in possibly starting
a small agency of my own.

1760
01:48:03,489 --> 01:48:08,980
Or perhaps I could do something with Tristan
- possibly get a new boat together or something.

1761
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:11,500
What do you think?'

1762
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,020
Stephen felt quite good about this idea.

1763
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:20,650
'Find out about the advertising world in this
area first, because that's what you know about,'

1764
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,650
said Anna.

1765
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:27,739
'But if you meant what do I think about me
and my life, well to be honest I've already

1766
01:48:27,739 --> 01:48:31,139
got some information about nursing around
here.

1767
01:48:31,139 --> 01:48:36,270
There's a hospital about fifty kilometres
away and there's a health centre nearer, in

1768
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:38,840
Kingham, so I could work from here.'

1769
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,060
'Ah ha!

1770
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:42,500
You're a quiet one!'

1771
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,500
Stephen said.

1772
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,080
'You never told me you were doing that!

1773
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:51,630
But seriously, what do you think about leaving
London, and everyone there?'

1774
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:57,750
'A bit nervous, but definitely interested,'
replied Anna.

1775
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:01,630
'I think I'm ready for a change, too.'

1776
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:04,670
She remembered she had thought this on her
last day at work.

1777
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:09,360
'And this place has become special, hasn't
it?'

1778
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:13,330
They went on talking like this for the next
few days.

1779
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:17,970
Tristan didn't ask them anything about their
plans, but they did ask him if he was serious

1780
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:20,100
about selling Dolphin Cottage.

1781
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:24,190
'Yes,' he replied, 'but only to the right
people.

1782
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:30,280
Either a local person or, as I've said before,
you two.'

1783
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:35,590
In the middle of the last week of their holiday,
they felt they'd reached some sort of decision.

1784
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:39,469
They'd ask Tristan if they could buy the cottage.

1785
01:49:39,469 --> 01:49:43,949
Other decisions were going to take longer
to make, and even longer to organize, but

1786
01:49:43,949 --> 01:49:46,340
this was a start.

1787
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:51,820
They met Tristan that evening in the Fisherman's
Arms and told him they wanted to go ahead.

1788
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:54,310
'Great,' said Tristan.

1789
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:59,260
He and Stephen shook hands, and Tristan kissed
Anna on the cheek.

1790
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:05,460
He smelt a little bit of fish, which immediately
reminded her of his car and their evening

1791
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,460
together.

1792
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:09,910
'Are you going to live in it all the time?'
he asked.

1793
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:13,969
'Eventually, yes,' said Anna quickly.

1794
01:50:13,969 --> 01:50:15,159
Stephen looked at her in surprise.

1795
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:20,030
'But we've got a lot of things to do first,
like sell the flat in London and sort out

1796
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:23,120
our jobs... and things.'

1797
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:27,639
The three of them said goodbye, promising
to discuss the details the next day.

1798
01:50:27,639 --> 01:50:32,179
'Why did you tell him we were going to live
in it all the time?

1799
01:50:32,179 --> 01:50:35,139
I thought we hadn't really decided that,'
said Stephen.

1800
01:50:35,139 --> 01:50:39,300
'I had the feeling it was the right thing
to say.

1801
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,380
He doesn't really want it to be just a holiday
place.

1802
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:46,449
I think he feels better about not selling
it to a villager if he knows it's going to

1803
01:50:46,449 --> 01:50:49,409
become someone's home.'

1804
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:52,429
They walked slowly up to the door of Dolphin
Cottage.

1805
01:50:52,429 --> 01:51:04,389
'In any case, I think we had decided in our
own minds,' she added.

1806
01:51:04,389 --> 01:51:06,219
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1807
01:51:06,219 --> 01:51:07,280
A visit from Jill

1808
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:12,310
'I see she's back then.'

1809
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:16,699
This was the welcome that Anna got when she
went into the shop the next morning.

1810
01:51:16,699 --> 01:51:21,890
'Here we go again,' she thought, 'more gossip.

1811
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:25,880
Still I'd better try to be polite if we're
going to live here.'

1812
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,449
The woman would be a bad enemy to have.

1813
01:51:28,449 --> 01:51:30,890
'Who's that, Mrs Lennox.

1814
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:32,570
Who's back?'

1815
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,250
Anna asked.

1816
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:36,469
'Tristan's friend - Jill.

1817
01:51:36,469 --> 01:51:40,370
I saw her coming down the hill early this
morning.

1818
01:51:40,370 --> 01:51:43,030
Went to his house, she did.'

1819
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:47,719
Mrs Lennox looked carefully at Anna to see
what she thought of this news.

1820
01:51:47,719 --> 01:51:50,719
Anna tried to show nothing on her face.

1821
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:52,599
'That's nice.

1822
01:51:52,599 --> 01:51:57,420
I'm sure he'll be pleased to see her,' she
managed to say.

1823
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:01,969
She then had a quick conversation with Mrs
Lennox about whether to buy brown bread or

1824
01:52:01,969 --> 01:52:06,270
white, and what the weather was going to be
like for the weekend.

1825
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:12,050
Outside, she decided not to take the direct
way back to the cottage, but to go round the

1826
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:13,199
harbour.

1827
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:15,199
She needed to calm down.

1828
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:18,870
The news of Jill's arrival had shaken her.

1829
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:23,840
She'd felt over the past week or so that she
could control her feelings for Tristan.

1830
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:29,960
OK, she liked him, but her feelings for Stephen
were stronger and deeper and she'd really

1831
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,929
felt there wouldn't be any difficulty between
the three of them.

1832
01:52:33,929 --> 01:52:36,590
Now she felt mixed up again.

1833
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:39,930
All sorts of things were going through her
head.

1834
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:43,889
Had Tristan known Jill was coming and hadn't
said anything?

1835
01:52:43,889 --> 01:52:45,880
How long was she staying?

1836
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,800
Would she get the chance to meet her?

1837
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:52,329
Did this make a difference to their plans?

1838
01:52:52,329 --> 01:52:57,770
When she got back, Anna told Stephen what
Mrs Lennox had said, without mentioning her

1839
01:52:57,770 --> 01:52:59,640
own feelings.

1840
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:04,150
What she did say was 'It'll be interesting
to meet her.'

1841
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:08,920
'You don't think she wants to move back into
Dolphin Cottage, do you?'

1842
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,760
Stephen said in a worried voice.

1843
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,050
'Oh God!

1844
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:16,520
This house-buying business is complicated!'

1845
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:20,080
They sat drinking coffee in silence.

1846
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:26,070
Down in the harbour they saw Tristan arrive
and with him was a tall woman with short,

1847
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:27,530
dark hair.

1848
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:32,700
She was wearing shorts and looking completely
at home.

1849
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:38,430
Anna and Stephen watched them both get on
board Wave Dancer and Jill, if it was her,

1850
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:41,600
helped get everyone else on board for the
trip.

1851
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:46,530
There was no Gary today, only Tristan and
Jill.

1852
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:51,940
Anna looked through the binoculars at them;
Tristan said something to the woman, who laughed

1853
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,430
happily.

1854
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:57,389
He didn't look up at the cottage as he usually
did.

1855
01:53:57,389 --> 01:54:02,550
Luckily, Anna had already arranged to go and
look around the main county hospital that

1856
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:07,369
morning so she didn't have time to think about
things too much.

1857
01:54:07,369 --> 01:54:11,800
She drove there with Stephen who was going
to visit the public library in the town to

1858
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:16,840
find out what he could about advertising companies
in the area.

1859
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:21,880
Anna liked the hospital; it was the medical
centre for the whole region so they saw a

1860
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:24,250
wide range of patients and problems.

1861
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:31,070
They told her they were usually short of nurses
so she'd be welcome to apply for a job.

1862
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:36,520
But she might have to wait some time before
she got a job at the same level as her one

1863
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,889
in London.

1864
01:54:37,889 --> 01:54:43,260
When they got back, they found a note on the
kitchen table from Tristan:

1865
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,699
Sorry to miss you.

1866
01:54:44,699 --> 01:54:48,989
If you're back in time, we'll be in the Fisherman's
from 5.

1867
01:54:48,989 --> 01:54:49,989
Tristan

1868
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:53,179
'Mmm, we'll be in the Fisherman's.

1869
01:54:53,179 --> 01:54:54,179
Interesting.

1870
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:56,280
Let's go,' said Stephen.

1871
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:01,280
'We'd better find out if we're still buying
the cottage.'

1872
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:05,199
Anna quickly changed into her jeans and they
went off to the pub.

1873
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:12,770
As they reached it, she saw Tristan and Jill
sitting close together and chatting happily.

1874
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:15,550
Stephen took hold of Anna's hand as they went
over.

1875
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:17,190
'Hi, Tristan.

1876
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:18,190
We got your note.

1877
01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:20,500
Here we are.'

1878
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,449
They sat down at the same table and ordered
coffee.

1879
01:55:24,449 --> 01:55:29,750
Jill was introduced and she started talking
about Dolphin Cottage.

1880
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:33,409
'You've got the best view in the whole of
Polreath from there, haven't you?

1881
01:55:33,409 --> 01:55:37,060
I used to sit in the front garden watching
everything in the harbour.'

1882
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:40,579
'So do we,' said Anna.

1883
01:55:40,579 --> 01:55:45,079
She tried hard not to stare at the attractive
woman sitting opposite her.

1884
01:55:45,079 --> 01:55:46,710
'It's a lovely old place.

1885
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:51,320
Does the cold tap in the bathroom still make
a funny noise when you turn it on?

1886
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:56,150
It used to drive me mad, but the owner never
came to fix it.'

1887
01:55:56,150 --> 01:55:58,849
And she gave Tristan a kiss.

1888
01:55:58,849 --> 01:56:01,860
Stephen said, 'I've mended it.

1889
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,550
It doesn't make a noise now.'

1890
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:09,760
Everybody seemed to be looking at everyone
else - Jill at Tristan, Tristan at Anna, Anna

1891
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,429
and Stephen at Jill.

1892
01:56:11,429 --> 01:56:14,590
'Oh well, that's good,' she laughed.

1893
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:18,099
'You sound the perfect people to buy it.'

1894
01:56:18,099 --> 01:56:23,790
Anna smiled at Stephen and thought, 'So he's
told her, and it doesn't sound as if she's

1895
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:26,080
planning to move back in.

1896
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:29,370
Good, that's one thing less to worry about.'

1897
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:33,170
'I've been in touch with my lawyer,' said
Tristan.

1898
01:56:33,170 --> 01:56:35,360
'There doesn't seem to be a problem.

1899
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,910
He's going to get things started.

1900
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:40,239
He needs the name of your lawyer, by the way.

1901
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:43,699
But we can do all that tomorrow, can't we?'

1902
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:45,239
'Fine,' said Stephen.

1903
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:46,960
'Anyone want another coffee?'

1904
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:53,190
'Me, please,' said Anna, and Stephen went
over to the bar.

1905
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:54,880
'Did you have a good trip this morning?'

1906
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,170
Anna asked Tristan.

1907
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:58,900
'We saw you both going out.'

1908
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:02,110
And Jill answered, 'Yes, it was great.

1909
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:04,940
Just like old times, wasn't it?'

1910
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:06,050
'Mm, yes.

1911
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:11,369
And you still can't tie a boat up properly,'
Tristan smiled at her.

1912
01:57:11,369 --> 01:57:16,139
When Stephen came back with Anna's coffee,
Tristan said, 'Come on Jill.

1913
01:57:16,139 --> 01:57:17,150
We'd better go.

1914
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:19,670
We're going over to St Leven for the evening.'

1915
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:27,440
A drive in the 'fishy' car and dinner at Gino's
I bet, thought Anna, and felt terrible.

1916
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,159
Why did he say that?

1917
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:32,250
He didn't need to tell us where they were
going.

1918
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:33,409
What's he doing?

1919
01:57:33,409 --> 01:57:36,860
Is he trying to make me jealous?

1920
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:41,060
'I'll come round tomorrow mid-morning, if
that's all right,' Tristan continued.

1921
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:45,760
'I'm glad everything seems to be working out
well - with the cottage and everything.'

1922
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:53,210
Later that night, for the first time in a
long time, Anna turned away from Stephen when

1923
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:59,219
he wanted to make love.

1924
01:57:59,219 --> 01:58:00,980
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1925
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:04,389
Anna's last trip

1926
01:58:04,389 --> 01:58:06,659
Friday was even hotter.

1927
01:58:06,659 --> 01:58:12,550
There was no wind, not even a breeze, and
the air was still.

1928
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:17,220
Stephen and Anna had a swim before breakfast,
then stood in their front garden with their

1929
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:19,650
coffee, looking around them.

1930
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:25,389
They were both thinking that this view was
going to be theirs - forever, if they wanted.

1931
01:58:25,389 --> 01:58:30,219
There would be days in the future when everything
looked as calm and beautiful as today, and

1932
01:58:30,219 --> 01:58:37,610
other times, in the winter, when storms would
hit and the sea would become frightening.

1933
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,829
Tristan came round at eleven.

1934
01:58:39,829 --> 01:58:42,570
Anna was out walking.

1935
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:47,480
She and Stephen had already decided that she
would go back to London by train that weekend

1936
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:52,860
to start work again on Monday morning - but
Stephen would stay on another week to sort

1937
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:55,780
some things out with Tristan.

1938
01:58:55,780 --> 01:59:01,090
'You're not having second thoughts about selling
the cottage, are you?' asked Stephen.

1939
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:03,219
'No, not really.

1940
01:59:03,219 --> 01:59:06,810
It's a big step, though, selling a family
house, isn't it?'

1941
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:08,810
Tristan drank his coffee thoughtfully.

1942
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:11,469
'But what about you two?

1943
01:59:11,469 --> 01:59:13,639
Are you OK about it all?

1944
01:59:13,639 --> 01:59:17,860
It's an even bigger step for you - a complete
change of life, really'

1945
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:23,240
'I personally can't wait to say goodbye to
the big city world of advertising,' said Stephen.

1946
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:28,060
'I don't know how I've managed to do it for
so long.'

1947
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:30,520
Anna came back in to the cottage looking hot.

1948
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:34,010
'I think I need another swim to cool down.

1949
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:35,930
There's no wind today.'

1950
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:41,030
'Mm, I hate to say it but I think the weather
is going to change,' said Tristan.

1951
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:44,030
'The forecast says that there'll be a thunderstorm
tonight.'

1952
01:59:44,030 --> 01:59:48,889
'Just at the right moment, at the end of our
holiday!'

1953
01:59:48,889 --> 01:59:49,889
laughed Anna.

1954
01:59:49,889 --> 01:59:52,320
'Perhaps it's trying to tell us something.'

1955
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:58,400
'What,' said Stephen with a smile, 'like there'll
be stormy times ahead in our lives?'

1956
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,400
'Yeah.

1957
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,630
Just like in the movies,' Anna said.

1958
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:06,540
'A good storm is the director's way of telling
the audience that something terrible is going

1959
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,000
to happen.'

1960
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,400
'Well, I'm going fishing this afternoon before
the weather changes,' said Tristan.

1961
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,550
'Anyone want to come?'

1962
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:19,800
But he was thinking, not anyone, just Anna...
please.

1963
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:22,650
'I won't,' replied Stephen.

1964
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:27,340
'I want to make some phone calls to the office
to see what the latest news is.

1965
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,340
You go Anna.

1966
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:34,639
It might be cooler on the water - and it'll
be your last chance before you go back.'

1967
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:39,310
At three that afternoon, Anna and Tristan
left the harbour and went in the direction

1968
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:42,070
of the western rocks.

1969
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:45,950
Anna was happy that Stephen had suggested
she came with Tristan.

1970
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:51,100
She wanted to be alone with him and think
things through before she went back to London.

1971
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:54,380
The sea was flat and calm as they fished near
the rocks.

1972
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:58,290
'Did you have a good time last night at Gino's?'
asked Anna.

1973
02:00:58,290 --> 02:01:02,860
It was no good, she had to know.

1974
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:06,910
She was furious with herself, but she realised
that she was jealous.

1975
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:13,849
'We didn't go to Gino's, but yes, thanks,
we had a nice evening,' he said.

1976
02:01:13,849 --> 02:01:17,989
Anna looked at him and found him looking at
her.

1977
02:01:17,989 --> 02:01:21,020
'Jill went back this morning, to London,'
said Tristan.

1978
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:23,929
'She came to say goodbye.

1979
02:01:23,929 --> 02:01:26,460
She's got a job in Singapore, starting next
month.'

1980
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:27,480
'Oh.

1981
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:30,940
How do you feel about that?'

1982
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:31,940
she asked.

1983
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:34,600
'A bit sad, in some ways.

1984
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:40,070
But we'd already accepted that we had no future
together, so it wasn't a big surprise.

1985
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,909
I'll miss her, though.'

1986
02:01:42,909 --> 02:01:44,730
Anna felt good.

1987
02:01:44,730 --> 02:01:48,000
She had been a little bit jealous of Jill.

1988
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,750
She took Tristan's hand and said, 'I thought
she was nice - and you two seemed to get on

1989
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:55,590
really well together.

1990
02:01:55,590 --> 02:01:59,210
I thought she might be coming back to live
here.'

1991
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:00,739
Tristan pulled her close.

1992
02:02:00,739 --> 02:02:04,210
'Would you have liked that?'

1993
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:08,719
'No, I'm sorry to say, I wouldn't.'

1994
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:12,750
All her mixed-up feelings of the last couple
of days were near the surface now.

1995
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:15,110
They began kissing.

1996
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:16,699
Neither of them wanted to stop.

1997
02:02:16,699 --> 02:02:21,940
They lay on the floor of the boat, pulling
off each other's clothes, and made love eagerly.

1998
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:26,940
All the things that they'd been holding back,
trying to forget, were set free.

1999
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:32,750
Being responsible, being strong-minded, Stephen,
Jill, everything - it was all gone from their

2000
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:33,750
minds.

2001
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:40,420
It was wonderful - a powerful and completely
selfish act.

2002
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:45,350
After lying there next to each other for a
while, Anna turned over to face him.

2003
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:47,260
'Oh hell!

2004
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:51,060
What have we done?'

2005
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:56,360
'Changed the rules of the game a bit, I'm
afraid,' replied Tristan kissing her gently,

2006
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:59,020
and feeling very loving towards her.

2007
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:01,530
'I think it was my fault.

2008
02:03:01,530 --> 02:03:03,849
I'm embarrassed to say it.

2009
02:03:03,849 --> 02:03:08,030
I was jealous, seeing you with Jill,' Anna
admitted.

2010
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:13,699
'I was going to say, "Now you know how I feel
when you're with Stephen", but it's not the

2011
02:03:13,699 --> 02:03:14,730
same.

2012
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:17,280
I surprise myself sometimes.

2013
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:20,770
I don't actually feel jealous of Stephen.

2014
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:23,409
Funny, isn't it?

2015
02:03:23,409 --> 02:03:29,260
But we didn't make love just because of Jill,
did we?' he asked anxiously.

2016
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:32,900
'No,' replied Anna, with a smile.

2017
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,719
'Because of us.'

2018
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:40,360
Tristan slowly got up, looked around to make
sure nobody was near, and jumped over the

2019
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:41,910
side of the boat.

2020
02:03:41,910 --> 02:03:46,920
'Brrrr, that's fresh!' he said, shaking the
water from his hair.

2021
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:52,630
'Why don't you come in?' he said to Anna who
was still sitting on the floor of the boat,

2022
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:55,320
looking over the side at him.

2023
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:58,550
She got into the water and swam with Tristan.

2024
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:02,790
The water was cold and took the heat from
her body.

2025
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:06,639
Tristan climbed back into the boat and watched
Anna as she swam towards him.

2026
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:11,119
'You're beautiful, you know,' he said as he
pulled her on board.

2027
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:13,750
Their cold bodies touched.

2028
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:15,350
'Here.'

2029
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:17,960
Tristan passed her a towel from his bag.

2030
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:21,290
They dried quickly and put their clothes on.

2031
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:26,420
'Now what?' he said, but was afraid to hear
her answer.

2032
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,949
'Stephen must never know,' said Anna.

2033
02:04:29,949 --> 02:04:31,790
'We must never do that again.

2034
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:32,790
We can't!

2035
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:35,900
There's no way we can have an affair.

2036
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:40,480
Can you imagine, in a place this size - everyone
would know about it.

2037
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:45,980
In fact, some bird probably saw us and is
already spreading the news - to Mrs Lennox,

2038
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,360
no doubt!'

2039
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:52,540
'Do you really think you can just switch off
all your feelings, just like a tap?

2040
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:54,260
I'm not sure I can.'

2041
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:57,329
'Well, we've got to.'

2042
02:04:57,329 --> 02:05:00,309
Reality was hitting Anna, and she was beginning
to worry.

2043
02:05:00,309 --> 02:05:02,670
Had they ruined everything?

2044
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:06,179
Would she be able to hide it from Stephen?

2045
02:05:06,179 --> 02:05:11,770
Should she tell him and make him come back
to London and forget about buying the cottage?

2046
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:16,000
Tonight was the last night of their holidays,
it would be natural for them to make love

2047
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,309
- could she do it?

2048
02:05:19,309 --> 02:05:21,230
'Anna, listen.

2049
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:24,159
I know the situation as well as you do.

2050
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:27,969
You're probably thinking it's not going to
work, the three of us living in such a small

2051
02:05:27,969 --> 02:05:32,070
place, and you may be right.'

2052
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,340
Tristan started the engine.

2053
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:36,440
He was feeling very confused.

2054
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:40,230
He didn't want this to be the only time that
they made love.

2055
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:43,000
But he knew the next move was Anna's.

2056
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,380
So he continued.

2057
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:47,230
'You've got a choice.

2058
02:05:47,230 --> 02:05:52,110
Go back to London and take Stephen with you
and forget all about Polreath and living here.

2059
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:56,400
Or leave things as they are and see what happens.

2060
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,099
You're going back to London tomorrow anyway.

2061
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:02,750
We won't see each other again until you come
back.

2062
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:05,790
Maybe a bit of time and distance will help.

2063
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:09,730
I don't want to ruin everything for you - or
for me, either.

2064
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:11,489
But I want you in my life.'

2065
02:06:11,489 --> 02:06:17,020
'Sounds simple, doesn't it?' said Anna.

2066
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:19,560
Tristan had his arm round Anna's waist.

2067
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:21,690
But now she moved gently away.

2068
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:24,050
'You're right, though.

2069
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:28,420
When we get back, I think it'd be better if
we just said goodbye for now.

2070
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:33,060
It'll be less complicated if all I have to
do is think about behaving normally until

2071
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:36,530
I get on the train tomorrow.'

2072
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:41,219
As the boat came into the harbour, Anna looked
up at the cottage and waved to Stephen sitting

2073
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:42,600
in the front.

2074
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:46,760
'Anna,' said Tristan quietly.

2075
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:51,670
'I'm not sorry about what happened this afternoon,
are you?'

2076
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:53,440
'No.

2077
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:58,110
But I want to shut it away in a box, and not
let it escape.

2078
02:06:58,110 --> 02:07:03,500
Please, Tristan, can we try and pretend nothing
has happened.'

2079
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,739
Tristan kissed her.

2080
02:07:04,739 --> 02:07:07,780
'Bye, Anna,' he said sadly.

2081
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:10,760
'I don't know how it'll be when we see each
other again.

2082
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:14,790
But I'm glad you came to Polreath this summer.'

2083
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:25,510
He got into his car and drove off leaving
Anna to walk home alone.

2084
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:27,150
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2085
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:28,160
A stormy night

2086
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:32,520
'No fish?' said Stephen.

2087
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:39,270
'Tristan had them all,' said Anna, and thought,
that was the first lie.

2088
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:42,900
'I thought we'd probably want to eat at Philpots
tonight.

2089
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:44,199
Shall we?'

2090
02:07:44,199 --> 02:07:45,199
'Sure.

2091
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:48,390
We can celebrate the beginning of our new
lives,' said Stephen.

2092
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:50,370
'I'll go and book.

2093
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:53,440
It's Friday and they might be busy tonight.'

2094
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,190
Anna wanted to get out of the house.

2095
02:07:56,190 --> 02:08:00,690
She booked a table for eight o'clock and then
went into the shop.

2096
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:05,110
If Mrs Lennox had somehow managed to learn
anything about her and Tristan, she wanted

2097
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:08,760
to give her the chance to say it directly
to her face.

2098
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:11,659
But fortunately nothing was said.

2099
02:08:11,659 --> 02:08:15,200
When she got back, Stephen was waiting for
her.

2100
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:20,170
'You rushed out so quickly you didn't give
me time to tell you my news!' he said, smiling

2101
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:21,170
happily.

2102
02:08:21,170 --> 02:08:26,030
'I rang Charlie to ask him about the chances
of my having to leave the new company.

2103
02:08:26,030 --> 02:08:29,800
He thought I was worried and tried to say
nice things.

2104
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:33,389
But when I told him I wanted to leave, he
laughed.'

2105
02:08:33,389 --> 02:08:34,699
'Why?'

2106
02:08:34,699 --> 02:08:35,969
asked Anna.

2107
02:08:35,969 --> 02:08:40,260
'Because apparently the new managing director
was just about to tell me that I had lost

2108
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:44,290
my job, and he was not looking forward to
saying it,' said Stephen.

2109
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:46,170
'When will this happen?'

2110
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:48,030
'In a couple of months!'

2111
02:08:48,030 --> 02:08:49,380
Stephen replied happily.

2112
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:54,469
'I'll be free of Jardine's - and I'll have
a "thank you and goodbye" present of a year's

2113
02:08:54,469 --> 02:08:55,840
salary.

2114
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,440
Not bad, eh?

2115
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:00,610
Somebody, somewhere is taking care of us,
don't you think?

2116
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:03,290
This is exactly what I wanted.'

2117
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:08,489
'Stephen, that's great - if it's really what
you want.'

2118
02:09:08,489 --> 02:09:10,530
'It is.

2119
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:13,639
Anna, are you having second thoughts?'

2120
02:09:13,639 --> 02:09:19,170
'No, not at all,' she replied quickly.

2121
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:23,280
Stephen took hold of her as she walked past
his chair on the way upstairs.

2122
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:27,430
She fell backwards onto him and he kissed
the back of her neck.

2123
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:30,239
'Mmm... salt and fish!

2124
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:31,909
You smell wonderful!'

2125
02:09:31,909 --> 02:09:34,270
'I need a shower.'

2126
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:38,119
She got up and kissed him on the nose.

2127
02:09:38,119 --> 02:09:40,550
The shower helped.

2128
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:43,000
'Everything's working out well for him,' she
thought.

2129
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,760
'There's no way I can suddenly change my mind
about living here.

2130
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:49,580
God, I feel awful.

2131
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:52,809
He would be so hurt if he ever found out.

2132
02:09:52,809 --> 02:09:54,440
I'm a fool!

2133
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:55,530
I'm confused!

2134
02:09:55,530 --> 02:10:00,000
I don't know what to think anymore.'

2135
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,330
She dried herself roughly.

2136
02:10:02,330 --> 02:10:06,909
The main thing now was to get through the
next few hours without a disaster.

2137
02:10:06,909 --> 02:10:09,639
Real thinking would come later.

2138
02:10:09,639 --> 02:10:11,849
She found Stephen in the front garden.

2139
02:10:11,849 --> 02:10:14,040
'Better?' he said.

2140
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:16,139
'Yes, much.'

2141
02:10:16,139 --> 02:10:19,639
'Something's changed,' he said looking around.

2142
02:10:19,639 --> 02:10:21,719
'What do you mean?'

2143
02:10:21,719 --> 02:10:23,170
she asked quickly.

2144
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:25,909
'The air smells different.

2145
02:10:25,909 --> 02:10:29,480
I think there is going to be a storm, after
all.'

2146
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:35,250
'Good,' she said before realizing what she
was saying.

2147
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:39,910
As they went up the hill to Philpots, they
could hear thunder in the distance and the

2148
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:43,320
first whisper of wind cooled their faces.

2149
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:48,800
Over dinner, Stephen was full of plans - what
he was going to do, when they'd be able to

2150
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:55,050
come back down, how they'd have to buy another
car - or maybe he'd get a motorbike.

2151
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:58,849
Anna listened, smiled and said very little.

2152
02:10:58,849 --> 02:11:05,010
Their dinner was excellent and the wine helped
Anna to relax more.

2153
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:09,460
When they left the restaurant, the wind had
got stronger and big drops of rain were hitting

2154
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:11,520
the ground, hard.

2155
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,790
The storm was coming in from the west.

2156
02:11:14,790 --> 02:11:18,449
Skellig was suddenly lit up by a flash of
lightning.

2157
02:11:18,449 --> 02:11:23,059
Stephen put his sweater over his head and
they both ran down the street.

2158
02:11:23,059 --> 02:11:24,329
Then they saw Tristan.

2159
02:11:24,329 --> 02:11:27,070
'Oh, hi!' said Tristan.

2160
02:11:27,070 --> 02:11:31,679
'I was just going to make sure the boat was
tied up properly.'

2161
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:35,270
Another flash of lightning showed the white
tops of the waves in the harbour.

2162
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:41,210
'Want some help?' asked Stephen, but Tristan
was already moving away.

2163
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:43,210
The air was electric.

2164
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:46,650
'Come on, Stephen,' said Anna running down
the street.

2165
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:51,280
'Let's get home before it gets any worse.'

2166
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:54,680
As they reached the cottage, there was a huge
crash of thunder.

2167
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:57,980
They stood in the doorway and watched.

2168
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:02,260
With each flash of lightning, the sky was
lit up and they could see ghostly figures

2169
02:12:02,260 --> 02:12:05,260
in the harbour, checking boat ropes.

2170
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:08,199
'The water's high tonight,' said Stephen.

2171
02:12:08,199 --> 02:12:14,360
'We've never seen it so high - no wonder Tristan
was worried.'

2172
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:16,829
Stephen and Anna went upstairs to bed.

2173
02:12:16,829 --> 02:12:20,460
But the storm was so wild and beautiful.

2174
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:26,949
Anna stood at the bedroom window with Stephen
behind her, his arms holding her close.

2175
02:12:26,949 --> 02:12:30,139
'Next week'll be strange without you here,'
he said.

2176
02:12:30,139 --> 02:12:32,429
'No, it won't.

2177
02:12:32,429 --> 02:12:36,540
You'll be so busy arranging things you won't
have time to notice.

2178
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:41,440
In any case, it'll give you a chance to get
used to it,' replied Anna.

2179
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,449
'In what way?'

2180
02:12:43,449 --> 02:12:48,020
'Well, I might not be able to move down here
as soon as you.

2181
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:51,200
I don't know about my job and things yet,
do I?

2182
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:55,650
You might have to spend a bit of time here
alone,' said Anna, and added quickly, 'before

2183
02:12:55,650 --> 02:12:57,210
I can join you.'

2184
02:12:57,210 --> 02:12:58,210
'Oh.

2185
02:12:58,210 --> 02:13:01,159
We'll have to talk about that next weekend.

2186
02:13:01,159 --> 02:13:03,230
I don't want to come back without you.

2187
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:08,020
I want to start this together,' and he kissed
the back of her neck.

2188
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:11,750
They went to bed and reached for each other.

2189
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:16,750
His body was usually so familiar and lovely
but tonight she felt uncomfortable with his

2190
02:13:16,750 --> 02:13:23,590
body beside her and her dreams that night
were full of disturbing pictures.

2191
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:28,429
In the morning, it took a long time to wake
from her deep sleep - the dreams were still

2192
02:13:28,429 --> 02:13:31,329
pulling her back down.

2193
02:13:31,329 --> 02:13:35,840
Stephen wasn't there, so she slowly got out
of bed and walked to the window.

2194
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,550
The scene outside was much changed.

2195
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:41,420
The storm had passed but the sky was grey.

2196
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:47,909
Rain had washed away all the summer's dirt
and the streets looked fresh.

2197
02:13:47,909 --> 02:13:54,010
She looked down at the harbour - Wave Dancer
was still there, good - but she noticed three

2198
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:57,760
other boats on the beach, on their sides.

2199
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:03,160
Several people were down there, standing around,
including Stephen and Tristan.

2200
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:06,420
She turned away from the window.

2201
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:10,079
When Stephen came back, she was ready to leave.

2202
02:14:10,079 --> 02:14:17,659
She walked around the cottage-saying goodbye
to it, wondering when - and if - she'd return.

2203
02:14:17,659 --> 02:14:21,280
Her feelings this morning matched the sky.

2204
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:25,309
Stephen thought she was unhappy because she
was going back to London, and she let him

2205
02:14:25,309 --> 02:14:26,309
think that.

2206
02:14:26,309 --> 02:14:31,710
They said a rather sad goodbye at Kingham
station.

2207
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:37,010
She stood at the carriage window, waving to
Stephen until he disappeared.

2208
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:42,600
Then she suddenly started to cry.

2209
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,550
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

2210
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:48,579
The end of the affair

2211
02:14:48,579 --> 02:14:53,810
Back in London, Anna tried to get herself
back into her normal routine.

2212
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:59,070
She was busy at the hospital, and that kept
her mind fully occupied.

2213
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:03,969
Everybody kept telling her how well she looked,
and younger, too, and that the seaside was

2214
02:15:03,969 --> 02:15:06,940
obviously good for her.

2215
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:11,050
The routine of her familiar life helped her
to calm down.

2216
02:15:11,050 --> 02:15:17,580
In the evenings, in the flat alone, she thought
about Polreath and Tristan and Stephen, and

2217
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:23,659
she gradually began to realise that what had
happened was no more than a holiday love affair.

2218
02:15:23,659 --> 02:15:29,530
A mixture of lots of different things had
let it happen - Stephen's work crisis, her

2219
02:15:29,530 --> 02:15:34,460
need for some sort of change, the fact that
Tristan was very attractive and was attracted

2220
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:40,590
to her, and the fact that he was so open and
easy to talk to - unlike Stephen recently

2221
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:45,889
- and of course the magic of the sun and the
sea.

2222
02:15:45,889 --> 02:15:49,849
But understanding it didn't make her feel
any better.

2223
02:15:49,849 --> 02:15:54,440
She felt guilty that she had started something
with Tristan that she knew now she couldn't

2224
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:55,580
continue.

2225
02:15:55,580 --> 02:16:00,540
She had a horrible feeling, however, that
it was different for Tristan - but then he

2226
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:04,139
wasn't married; he had less to lose.

2227
02:16:04,139 --> 02:16:06,270
And she was right.

2228
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:09,480
Tristan couldn't get Anna out of his mind.

2229
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,610
The only time he felt calm was when he went
out fishing.

2230
02:16:12,610 --> 02:16:18,210
And as for talking to Stephen - well, it was
getting more and more difficult.

2231
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:24,060
Stephen, however, wanted to get on with the
business of buying Dolphin Cottage.

2232
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:28,739
They had agreed on the sale price, and he
wanted to pay Tristan the deposit before he

2233
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:32,030
went back to London at the weekend.

2234
02:16:32,030 --> 02:16:36,910
So early on Wednesday morning, he went down
to the harbour and found Tristan busy on his

2235
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:37,910
boat.

2236
02:16:37,910 --> 02:16:40,640
'Morning, Tristan,' he said.

2237
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:43,210
'Didn't see you yesterday.

2238
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:44,490
Everything OK?'

2239
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:49,760
'Yes, fine thanks,' Tristan replied as he
untied the ropes that held Wave Dancer to

2240
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,610
the harbour wall.

2241
02:16:51,610 --> 02:16:57,189
'I'm just going to pick up the lobster pots
I put down yesterday, behind Skellig.'

2242
02:16:57,189 --> 02:16:58,200
'Right.

2243
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,960
Look, can we meet tomorrow evening?

2244
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:04,019
I should have the cheque by then,' said Stephen.

2245
02:17:04,019 --> 02:17:09,700
'In the Fisherman's about seven?' said Tristan
turning Wave Dancer away from the harbour

2246
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,700
wall.

2247
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:16,760
'Sorry, Stephen, can't stop to talk now, I've
got a lot to do.'

2248
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:22,310
On Thursday morning, Anna woke up with a clear
head - as soon as she opened her eyes, she

2249
02:17:22,310 --> 02:17:25,130
knew that they couldn't buy Dolphin Cottage.

2250
02:17:25,130 --> 02:17:27,439
They couldn't live in Polreath.

2251
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:33,019
She knew that seeing Tristan every day would
be a constant reminder and, if she was honest,

2252
02:17:33,019 --> 02:17:37,219
she was afraid that what had happened once
could happen again.

2253
02:17:37,219 --> 02:17:40,639
Was she really strong enough to cut the relationship?

2254
02:17:40,639 --> 02:17:43,660
Tristan was lovely - too lovely to hurt any
more.

2255
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:48,430
Surely, it was better to end it all now while
she still had the choice.

2256
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,099
Stephen need never know.

2257
02:17:50,099 --> 02:17:54,820
Anna stood in the shower, letting the water
run over her face.

2258
02:17:54,820 --> 02:17:58,120
'Oh Stephen, I'm sorry.

2259
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:00,840
You'd never trust me again if you found out,
would you?'

2260
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:02,750
Anna thought.

2261
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:07,320
She realised she didn't want to lose him and
the life they had together.

2262
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:12,890
True, some of the early excitement had disappeared
over the ten years of their married life,

2263
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:17,920
and he could be difficult to live with but
she knew him so well.

2264
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:22,820
She knew what he liked to eat, she knew the
way he combed his hair, she knew what he would

2265
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:24,649
think about a programme on TV.

2266
02:18:24,649 --> 02:18:27,850
He was part of her.

2267
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:32,290
The first thing she had to do was stop Stephen
buying Dolphin Cottage tonight.

2268
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:38,590
He was going to be very confused about why
she had changed her mind and horribly disappointed.

2269
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:40,590
And he'd have to find a new job somewhere.

2270
02:18:40,590 --> 02:18:41,740
Oh God!

2271
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:48,300
How was she going to explain her reasons - maybe
she could introduce the idea of moving out

2272
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:52,870
of London but not going quite so far as Cornwall.

2273
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:57,380
It was true she had been thinking about the
things she would miss when they moved - her

2274
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:59,979
friends, the fun of living in the capital
city.

2275
02:18:59,979 --> 02:19:01,700
What about Brighton!

2276
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:07,250
Lots of London people moved to Brighton, and
she and Stephen had always enjoyed the weekends

2277
02:19:07,250 --> 02:19:10,300
they had spent there.

2278
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:13,080
Just as she was walking through to the kitchen,
the phone rang.

2279
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:15,550
It made her jump.

2280
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:18,710
'Stephen, or Mum,' she thought.

2281
02:19:18,710 --> 02:19:22,550
'They're the only people who'd phone so early
in the morning.

2282
02:19:22,550 --> 02:19:25,559
Or maybe it's Tristan.'

2283
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:29,250
Whoever it was, she wasn't ready to speak.

2284
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:32,010
She picked it up nervously.

2285
02:19:32,010 --> 02:19:34,319
It was Stephen.

2286
02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:37,189
'Anna, I've just seen Tristan.

2287
02:19:37,189 --> 02:19:39,719
He's just told me something.

2288
02:19:39,719 --> 02:19:42,719
We've got to talk.'

2289
02:19:42,719 --> 02:20:16,109
Anna's heart froze.
