1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,790
Doctor John Perry decided it was time to go
home.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:18,640
It had been a perfect day, a day alone, the
first such day in many years.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,680
He had filled his bag with all sorts of sea-shells
- enough to study for months.

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,950
He picked up his bag of shells and walked
toward the edge of the island.

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:42,370
He came to the sand reef that connected the
island and the shore of the mainland.

6
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,630
He stopped for a moment to enjoy the sunset
on the ocean water.

7
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:55,190
Then he began to walk along the sand reef
toward the shore.

8
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:03,989
The gray colors of evening were beginning
to spread across the ocean and the sand.

9
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,379
He hurried on.

10
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,740
Then, suddenly, he stepped into the water.

11
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,439
Before he knew what had happened he dropped
down and down.

12
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,749
The water was covering his head.

13
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:26,040
He rose to the top of the water struggling
to get back on to the dry sand.

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,289
He felt the water rushing about him.

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:38,110
Somehow, he got on to the sand and sat down,
wet and surprised at his sudden drop.

16
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,569
He heard the water still rushing about.

17
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,600
Then he saw a long gray shark.

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,479
He stood up and looked around.

19
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,799
He saw the shark swim toward the shore and
then he saw other sharks.

20
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,329
Five - six - seven of them.

21
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,869
But where was the sand reef?

22
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,590
What had happened to it?

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,000
He began to walk back toward the island.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,860
While he had searched for shells on the island
the strong ocean waves had washed a large

25
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,810
part of the sand reef away.

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,069
There was nothing between him and the shore
but water...

27
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,379
and sharks.

28
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:40,400
He did not know much about sharks but he was
a good swimmer.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,450
He looked at the shore which was now almost
black against the red sky.

30
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,610
He could swim, but what about the sharks?

31
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,909
Do they attack in the night?

32
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,350
He tried to remember what he had read about
sharks.

33
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,800
Did sharks find their food by smelling it?

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:14,230
If they did it meant they looked for food
at all times, even during the night.

35
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,939
He decided not to swim to shore; it was too
dark and he wanted to see the enemy if he

36
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,680
was to fight it.

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,390
He looked around for his bag of shells and
found it a few meters away.

38
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:38,480
He pulled the bag on to some dry sand, then
sat down next to it.

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,620
The wind was warm.

40
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,609
The stars began to show.

41
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:48,750
The moon rose.

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,930
The water looked peaceful and quiet and yellow
in the moonlight.

43
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,510
The gentle noises of night soon made him sleep
but not for long.

44
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,870
Host of the night he lay down and looked.

45
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,730
up at the stars, thinking.

46
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,709
He thought of wood for a fire, wood to signal
for help.

47
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,670
But there was no wood.

48
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,850
He thought of the sharks.

49
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,510
Would they go away during the night?

50
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,210
At last, he thought of sleep.

51
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,530
It came at last.

52
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,260
He slept until the sun rose.

53
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,170
He felt stiff when he got up.

54
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,060
He moved about, then looked at the water before
him.

55
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,820
It was clear and green.

56
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:51,220
Far off, he could hear the noise of splashing
water made by the sharks.

57
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,660
He saw red areas on the water.

58
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,980
He knew the sharks were killing and eating
the fish.

59
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,760
The sharks were there because the fish were
there.

60
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:11,810
The same waves that had washed the sand reef
away had somehow pushed large schools of fish

61
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,140
into the area.

62
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,320
He watched the sharks kill.

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,460
They swam after the schools of fish, played
with them and killed them even though they

64
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,220
were not hungry.

65
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:36,340
They would not let the fish swim out into
the open sea.

66
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,480
He looked at the sea.

67
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,560
If he swam to shore he would be in the water
five... six minutes.

68
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,250
A lot could happen in that time.

69
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,070
He looked at the sharks now near the shore.

70
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,300
They were still feeding.

71
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,690
It was hard to think of himself being attacked
by a shark.

72
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:14,280
A man when he is healthy feels good, but the
pain - a torn belly, a missing leg, a badly

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,590
crushed head by those powerful teeth.

74
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,880
No, no!

75
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,010
He wanted to live.

76
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:33,520
To swim now might mean sudden death, but the
sharks might stay here for days, a week, or

77
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,550
more.

78
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,710
He decided to swim.

79
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,300
He took off all his clothes.

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,630
He kept only his belt and his small knife.

81
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,000
The sharks were far off.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,270
He silently slipped into the water.

83
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,060
He went deep down and looked around.

84
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:06,300
He was about to rise to the top and start
swimming when he saw a long gray body below

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
him.

86
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,250
Small dots of sunlight danced on the shark's
body down through the clear water.

87
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,650
He kicked himself up to the top and struggled
on to the sand.

88
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,590
If he had not looked down he would be half
way across now, with the shark chasing after

89
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,260
him.

90
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,470
He did not think of the rest.

91
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,800
He stood up and looked around again.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
How could he make the sharks move out to sea?

93
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,920
If they swam out to sea he could swim to shore
before they saw him.

94
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,670
He saw the sharks rolling and playing.

95
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,020
Their hunger was now gone, they were killing
for fun.

96
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,890
How could he make them move?

97
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,690
He pulled his knife from his belt.

98
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,310
Sharks can smell blood, he thought.

99
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,930
He put the knife against his leg and cut deep
into the flesh.

100
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,240
The blood ran out.

101
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,630
He caught it on his white shirt.

102
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:27,750
When the shirt was red and wet he tied some
cloth around his leg to stop the flow of blood.

103
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:36,750
He tied a long piece of cloth to the shirt,
then walked to the edge of the sand.

104
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:44,370
He threw the shirt into the water and pulled
it with the piece of cloth.

105
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,400
The sharks smelled the blood.

106
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,810
They came racing toward the shirt.

107
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,130
He ran down the sand reef pulling the shirt.

108
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,460
The sharks raced after it.

109
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,650
He was leading them away from shore.

110
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:06,030
Suddenly, he dropped the cloth, turned toward
shore and ran as fast as he could.

111
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,760
He jumped into the water and swam.

112
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,010
He was half way across when he turned to look
back.

113
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:20,940
A high bony fin was cutting through the water
toward him.

114
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,490
He put his face in the water and kicked and
pulled himself forward as fast as he could.

115
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,610
The shore was nearer now.

116
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,620
But he thought of his belly under the water.

117
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,760
How defenseless it was!

118
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,300
He thought of the flat nose of the shark hitting
from below.

119
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,670
He lifted his head again to breathe.

120
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,870
He saw the shore very near.

121
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:53,580
From behind he felt the water rush toward
him, almost pushing him, helping him.

122
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,740
He kicked and shouted as loud as he could.

123
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,460
Then a great gray body hit him.

124
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,450
It almost rolled him over in the water.

125
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,020
He touched the shore with his fingers and
pulled himself up the stones.

126
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,740
The shark excited by the smell of blood and
the chase went after him.

127
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,020
Its great body crashed against the stones.

128
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,580
It rolled and turned as it dropped back into
the water.

129
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,300
The other sharks jumped on it.

130
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,680
The end came quickly as the shark's blood
turned the water red.

131
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,710
The injured shark was eaten alive as it tried
to escape.

132
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:33,980
- THE END -
