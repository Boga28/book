1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,610
Hester was a beautiful woman whose family
was important and powerful.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,180
But she had no luck.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,600
Hester fell in love and got married.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,020
But her marriage became dull and empty.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,430
She had three beautiful children - a boy and
two girls.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,210
But she did not love them.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,730
Hester pretended that she loved them, but
she knew that she did not.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,890
Hester's husband travelled to the city each
day and worked in an office.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,870
But he was not very successful in his job
and did not earn much money.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,350
Hester did not know how to make money either.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,720
They both spent more money than they could
earn.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,940
So they had serious money problems.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,640
Hester and her family lived in a fine house,
which had a pleasant garden.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,579
Beautiful and expensive things filled the
house.

15
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,920
The children had all the toys that they wanted.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,299
But sometimes it seemed that a voice was whispering
in the house.

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,259
The children could hear the voice all the
time.

18
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:14,500
Nobody spoke about it, but the whisper was
everywhere.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,179
There must be more money!

20
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:21,799
There must be more money!

21
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,759
Hester's son was called Paul.

22
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,369
'Mother,' said Paul, 'why don't we have our
own car?'

23
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,310
'Because we're the poor members of the family,'
she said.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,939
'But why are we poor, mother?' asked Paul.

25
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:45,829
When Hester replied, her voice was cold, hard
and angry.

26
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:51,149
'Well,' she said slowly, 'it's because your
father had no luck.'

27
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,409
'Is luck the same thing as money, mother?'

28
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,439
'No, Paul.

29
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
Luck brings money.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,419
If you're lucky, you have money.

31
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:08,179
That's why it's better to be born lucky than
rich.

32
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,549
If you're rich, you may lose your money.

33
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:14,560
But if you're lucky, you will always get more
money.'

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,890
'Oh!' said Paul.

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,719
'And is father not lucky?'

36
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,799
'He's very unlucky, I think,' said the mother
bitterly.

37
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,849
'Well,' said Paul, 'I'm a lucky person.'

38
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,849
'Excellent!' said Hester, laughing.

39
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,560
Paul saw that his mother did not believe him,
and this made him angry.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,830
So the boy decided to try and find luck.

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,950
Paul had a rocking horse in the nursery, the
room where the children played.

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,150
While his sisters played with their dolls,
Paul sat on the big wooden rocking horse and

43
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,989
rode it madly.

44
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,299
Then he stood in front of it, staring into
its face.

45
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:08,470
Its red mouth was slightly open, and its big
glass eyes were wide and bright.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:15,120
'Take me to the place where there is luck!'
he said to the horse.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,400
The horse could help him to find luck.

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,150
That is what Paul believed.

49
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,080
Sometimes he hit the horse on the neck, to
make it go faster.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,440
He rode it more and more wildly, hoping for
luck.

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,889
Paul's mother had a brother, Oscar Cresswell.

52
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,930
One day Paul's mother and Uncle Oscar came
to the nursery when Paul was riding his horse.

53
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,290
'Hello, young jockey!' said Uncle Oscar.

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,519
'Is your horse going to win its race?'

55
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,870
Paul finished his mad ride and got down from
the horse.

56
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,999
'What's the horse's name?' asked Uncle Oscar.

57
00:03:55,999 --> 00:04:01,209
'He doesn't have just one name,' said Paul
quietly.

58
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,200
'He has different names.

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,450
He was called Sansovino last week.'

60
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,299
'Sansovino?' said Oscar.

61
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,200
He was surprised.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,040
'But that's the name of the horse which won
the big race at Ascot.

63
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,310
How did you know that name?'

64
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,199
'He talks about horse-races with Bassett,'
said Paul's sister.

65
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,970
Bassett was the young gardener who worked
for Paul's parents.

66
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,199
He had been Oscar Cresswell's servant in the
war, when Oscar was an army officer.

67
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,780
Bassett now worked in the garden of Paul's
house.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,310
Bassett knew a lot about horseracing.

69
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,789
Oscar was very pleased that Paul was becoming
interested in horseracing too.

70
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:51,250
He went to see Bassett to ask him a few questions
about his nephew.

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,599
'Master Paul asks me a lot of questions about
the races, sir,' said Bassett.

72
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,150
'And does he ever make a bet?' asked Oscar.

73
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,360
'I don't want to tell you Master Paul's secrets,'
said Bassett.

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,770
'Please will you ask him that question yourself?'

75
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,180
Oscar took Paul for a ride in his car.

76
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,380
'Tell me, Paul, do you ever bet money on a
horse?' he asked.

77
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,130
'Do you think that I shouldn't?' asked Paul.

78
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,020
'No,' said his uncle.

79
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,139
'I hoped that you could give me a tip for
the next big race at Lincoln.

80
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,650
What's your advice?

81
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,360
Which horse is going to win?'

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,900
'It's going to be Daffodil,' said Paul.

83
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,080
Daffodil had not run in many races and had
not been successful.

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,419
No one expected Daffodil to win the race.

85
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,690
'Daffodil!' asked Oscar.

86
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,580
'Are you sure?

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,460
What about Mirza?'

88
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,970
'I only know the winner,' said Paul.

89
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,509
'That's Daffodil.

90
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,410
You won't give the information to anybody
else, will you Uncle?

91
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,910
I promised Bassett that I wouldn't tell anyone.

92
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,800
Bassett and I are partners.

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,990
We share our information with each other.

94
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,760
'Bassett lent me five shillings to bet on
my first racehorse,' Paul went on.

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,520
'But the horse lost.

96
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,960
Then you gave me ten shillings.

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,759
I bet that money on a horse, and it won!

98
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,290
So I thought that you were lucky.

99
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,010
But you won't tell anyone else, will you?'

100
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,720
'All right,' said Oscar.

101
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,659
'I'll keep your tip about Daffodil a secret.

102
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,500
How much money are you going to bet on Daffodil?'

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,919
'Three hundred pounds,' said the boy in a
serious voice.

104
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,379
Oscar was very surprised.

105
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,630
Three hundred pounds was a huge amount of
money.

106
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,120
He laughed.

107
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,720
'Where is your three hundred pounds?' he asked.

108
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,900
'Bassett keeps it safely for me,' the boy
replied.

109
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,020
'And how much is Bassett betting on Daffodil?

110
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,530
'Perhaps a hundred and fifty pounds,' said
Paul.

111
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,949
Oscar was silent.

112
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:17,210
He was very surprised but he was also very
interested.

113
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,199
He decided to take Paul to the racecourse
where Daffodil was racing.

114
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,290
It was Paul's first visit to a race meeting
and his blue eyes shone with excitement.

115
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,139
Daffodil won his race.

116
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:38,180
'I have one thousand, five hundred pounds
now,' said Paul.

117
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,930
'Uncle, if you want to be a partner with Bassett
and me, we could all be partners.

118
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,740
But you must make a promise.

119
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,849
You must never give the information about
the winning horses to anybody else.'

120
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:58,039
The next afternoon, Oscar took Bassett and
Paul to a park and they talked.

121
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,530
'If I'm sure about the winner, we're successful,'
said Paul.

122
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,259
'But sometimes I'm not sure.

123
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,610
Then we lose.'

124
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,419
'But when are you sure?' asked Uncle Oscar.

125
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:20,620
'It's Master Paul, sir,' said Bassett slowly,
in a soft, quiet voice.

126
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,770
'Perhaps Heaven tells him.

127
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,289
He was absolutely certain that Daffodil would
win.'

128
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,159
'But where's the money that Paul has won?'
asked Oscar.

129
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,680
'I keep it safely for him,' said Bassett.

130
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,280
'Whenever Master Paul wants the money, he
can have it.'

131
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,440
'Fifteen hundred pounds!' said Oscar, shaking
his head.

132
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,640
He almost did not believe it.

133
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,310
'Yes,' said Bassett.

134
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,040
They drove home again.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,840
Oscar asked to see Paul's fifteen hundred
pounds, and Bassett showed it to him.

136
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,820
Then Oscar decided to become a partner too.

137
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,740
'Sometimes I'm absolutely sure which horse
will win,' said Paul.

138
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,720
'I was sure about Daffodil.

139
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,070
Sometimes I have an idea, and sometimes I
have no idea at all, do I, Bassett?

140
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,650
Then we have to be careful, because we lose.'

141
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,740
'And when you're sure, what makes you sure?'
asked Oscar.

142
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,250
Paul looked uncomfortable.

143
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,360
'Oh, well, I don't know,' he said.

144
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,950
'I'm sure, Uncle.

145
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,690
That's all.'

146
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,330
The next race was the Leger.

147
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,510
Paul was 'sure' about the winner of this race.

148
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,310
He bet a thousand pounds on a horse called
Lively Spark.

149
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,120
Lively Spark came in first place and

150
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,210
Paul won ten thousand pounds.

151
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,100
Oscar Cresswell won two thousand pounds.

152
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,370
'You see,' said Paul.

153
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,670
'I was absolutely sure that Lively Spark would
win.'

154
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,340
'I don't understand how you're guessing correctly,'
said Oscar.

155
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,010
'What are you going to do with your money?'

156
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,090
'I wanted to get money for mother,' replied
Paul.

157
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,470
'She said that she had no luck because father
is unlucky.

158
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,230
I want to be lucky.

159
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,860
Then 1 can stop the whispers in our house.'

160
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,040
'Whispers in the house?'

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,330
repeated Oscar in surprise.

162
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,650
'What do you mean?'

163
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,050
'Oh - oh, I don't know,' said Paul.

164
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,100
'But the house never has enough money.

165
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,360
And so it's always whispering.

166
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,960
I want to stop the whispers.

167
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,060
But I don't want mother to know about my luck.

168
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,920
She wouldn't let me bet on the horses.'

169
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,000
'Very well, Paul!

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,430
We won't tell her,' said Oscar.

171
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,290
Paul and his uncle made a plan.

172
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,050
Paul gave five thousand pounds to Oscar, and
Oscar gave the money to a lawyer.

173
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,710
The lawyer was going to tell Hester about
a relative who she had never met.

174
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,800
Hester was going to get five thousand pounds
because the relative had died.

175
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,070
Each year, on her birthday, Hester was going
to receive one thousand pounds.

176
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:33,150
'So my sister will have a birthday present
of a thousand pounds for the next five years!'

177
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,510
said Oscar.

178
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,770
Paul's mother had her birthday in November.

179
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,420
By that time, the whispers in the house had
become very loud.

180
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,490
Paul was worried.

181
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,070
Hester opened her letters at breakfast on
her birthday.

182
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,060
Paul watched his mother's face carefully as
she read the lawyer's letter.

183
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,830
But she did not smile, her face became hard
and cold.

184
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,170
'Did you have any presents for your birthday?'
asked Paul.

185
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,070
'Not really,' said his mother.

186
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,540
Then she went to the city.

187
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,420
In the afternoon, Oscar came to the house.

188
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,670
He told Paul that his mother had been to see
the lawyer.

189
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,160
She had many large debts and she owed a lot
of money too many people.

190
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,210
So one thousand pounds was not enough for
her.

191
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,820
She wanted to have the whole amount.

192
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,020
She wanted the five thousand pounds immediately.

193
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,600
'Oh, let her have all the money now,' said
Paul.

194
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,500
'We can win some more money.

195
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,580
We'll get a lot of money if I choose the winners
of the Grand National, or the Lincolnshire,

196
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,330
or the Derby.

197
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,210
I'm sure to know the winner for one of these
races.'

198
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,940
So Hester got the whole five thousand pounds.

199
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,080
She spent a lot of money on new furniture
and expensive things for the house.

200
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,430
She told Paul that he would go to an expensive
school in the autumn.

201
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,700
Then something very strange happened.

202
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,770
The voices in the house suddenly changed.

203
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,540
Before, they had only whispered.

204
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,570
But now, they began to shout: There must be
more money!

205
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,710
There must be more money!

206
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,000
Paul was frightened.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,760
He spent a lot of time with Bassett.

208
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,130
The day of the Grand National race arrived,
but Paul was not sure about the name of the

209
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,350
winner.

210
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,500
He bet on the wrong horse and lost a hundred
pounds.

211
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,800
He did not know the winner for the Lincoln
either, and he lost fifty pounds.

212
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,360
He became very worried and his eyes were wild
and strange.

213
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,640
'Don't worry about it, my boy!' said Oscar.

214
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,970
The next big race was the Derby.

215
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,330
'I must know the winner for the Derby!' said
Paul.

216
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,690
His big blue eyes shone strangely.

217
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,570
Even his mother noticed that Paul did not
look well.

218
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,890
'Perhaps you need a holiday,' she said.

219
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,140
'Would you like to go to the seaside?

220
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,040
You'll feel better near the sea.

221
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,630
The sun and fresh air will help you.'

222
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,510
'Mother, I can't go away before the Derby,'
said Paul.

223
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,600
'You care too much about these horse-races,'
Hester said.

224
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,370
'It's not good for you.'

225
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,570
'Please don't send me away until after the
Derby,' said Paul.

226
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,100
'Don't send me away from this house.'

227
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,420
'Do you love this house so much?' asked his
mother in surprise.

228
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,580
'I didn't know that.

229
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,670
Very well.

230
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,600
You can stay here until after the Derby.'

231
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,500
There was a secret reason why Paul wanted
to stay in the house.

232
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,650
He had not told anyone about it - not even
Uncle Oscar or Bassett.

233
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,060
His secret was his wooden rocking horse, which
did not have a name.

234
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,510
He asked for the horse to be moved to his
bedroom.

235
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,010
'But aren't you too big for a rocking horse?'
asked Hester.

236
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,010
'Well, I can't have a real horse of my own,'
Paul said.

237
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,150
'And the rocking horse is a good friend to
me.'

238
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,870
The time for the Derby was getting near.

239
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,190
Paul behaved more and more strangely.

240
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,530
He became very thin and his eyes were wild.

241
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,950
His mother was worried about him.

242
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,190
Two nights before the Derby, Paul's mother
and father were at a big party.

243
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,000
Suddenly his mother felt worried about Paul.

244
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,890
She telephoned the house and spoke to the
children's governess.

245
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,020
'Is Master Paul all right?' asked Hester.

246
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,250
'Oh, yes,' said the governess in surprise.

247
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,780
'He's fine.'

248
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,050
Paul's parents got home at about one o'clock.

249
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,640
The house was very quiet.

250
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,990
Hester went upstairs to her son's room.

251
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,550
She stood outside Paul's bedroom door, listening.

252
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,750
A strange noise was coming from inside the
room.

253
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,300
Hester's heart gave a jump and almost stopped.

254
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,540
What was that noise?

255
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,880
The strange, mad sound went on and on.

256
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,660
Hester had heard the sound before, but she
did not know what it was.

257
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,880
Feeling very afraid, Hester slowly and carefully
turned the handle of the door.

258
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,600
The bedroom was dark.

259
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,740
But near the window, she saw something moving
wildly.

260
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,550
She switched on the light and stared in fear
and surprise.

261
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,009
Her son was wearing his pyjamas and riding
on the wooden horse.

262
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,009
'Paul!'

263
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:09,199
she cried.

264
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,110
'What are you doing?'

265
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,569
'It's Malabar!'

266
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,629
the boy screamed in a loud, strange voice.

267
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:22,350
'It's Malabar!'

268
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,069
He stared at his mother, his eyes shining
with a strange fire.

269
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,370
Then he stopped the horse and fell down onto
the floor.

270
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,380
Hester ran to Paul, picked him up, and took
him to his bed.

271
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,290
His body was hot and he was very weak.

272
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,620
He talked all the time in a wild, mad way.

273
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,830
'Malabar!

274
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,000
It's Malabar!' he shouted.

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
'Bassett!

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,970
Bassett, I know!

277
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,549
It's Malabar!'

278
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,799
'Who or what is Malabar?'

279
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,350
Hester asked her brother later.

280
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,250
'What does he mean?'

281
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,770
Her heart felt as dead as a stone.

282
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,080
'It's the name of a racehorse,' said Oscar.

283
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,820
'Malabar is running in the Derby.'

284
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,980
Paul was very ill.

285
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,480
But Oscar bet a thousand pounds on Malabar.

286
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,530
On the third day of Paul's illness, his mother
sat by his bed.

287
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,160
Paul was not asleep, and he was not awake.

288
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,529
His eyes stared ahead but saw nothing.

289
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,929
They were like blue stones.

290
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:40,259
His mother's heart felt like a stone too.

291
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,539
On the day of the Derby, Bassett came into
the house in the evening.

292
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,520
He wanted to see Paul.

293
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,830
Paul's parents agreed and Bassett went into
the boy's bedroom.

294
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,960
'Master Paul!' he whispered.

295
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,929
'Malabar came in first!

296
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:57,929
It won!

297
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,899
I did what you told me to do.

298
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,720
I bet on Malabar.

299
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,789
You now have eighty thousand pounds.'

300
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,639
Paul was very excited.

301
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:16,270
He kept saying the same thing again and again.

302
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,270
'Malabar!

303
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,270
Malabar!

304
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,649
Do you think I'm lucky, Mother?

305
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:24,280
I knew Malabar, didn't I?

306
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,019
Eighty thousand pounds!

307
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,110
That's lucky, isn't it, Mother?

308
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,340
If I can ride my rocking horse, then I can
be sure of the winner!

309
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,149
Mother, did I ever tell you?

310
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:38,620
I am lucky!'

311
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,720
'No, you never told me,' said his mother.

312
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,870
Later in the night, Paul died.

313
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,490
'My God,' said Oscar Cresswell to his sister.

314
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,179
'You've got eighty thousand pounds, but you've
lost your son.

315
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,500
Perhaps it's good that he's dead.

316
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,539
Now Paul is at peace.

317
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,450
He'll never have to ride a rocking horse again
to find a winner.'

318
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:09,649
- THE END -
