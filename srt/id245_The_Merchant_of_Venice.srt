1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,710
Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,480
ANTONIO

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,960
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,600
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,340
But how I caught it, found it, or came by
it,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,740
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,090
I am to learn;

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,120
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,980
That I have much ado to know myself.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,980
SALARINO

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,879
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;

12
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,080
There, where your argosies with portly sail,

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,680
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,950
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,230
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,370
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,280
As they fly by them with their woven wings.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
SALANIO

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,539
The better part of my affections would

21
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,050
Be with my hopes abroad.

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,550
I should be still

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,469
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the
wind,

24
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,180
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,640
And every object that might make me fear

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,240
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,780
Would make me sad.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
SALARINO

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,270
My wind cooling my broth

30
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,939
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought

31
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,720
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,980
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,560
But I should think of shallows and of flats,

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,540
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,

35
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,560
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,530
To kiss her burial.

37
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,790
Should I go to church

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,079
And see the holy edifice of stone,

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,080
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,

40
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,369
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,

41
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,119
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,

42
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,050
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,

43
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,070
And, in a word, but even now worth this,

44
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,270
And now worth nothing?

45
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,270
Shall I have the thought

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,850
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought

47
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,070
That such a thing bechanced would make me
sad?

48
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,200
But tell not me; I know, Antonio

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,409
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

50
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,409
ANTONIO

51
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,580
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,330
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,

53
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,709
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate

54
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,269
Upon the fortune of this present year:

55
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,940
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

56
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,940
SALARINO

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,300
Why, then you are in love.

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
ANTONIO

59
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Fie, fie!

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
SALARINO

61
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,360
Not in love neither?

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
Then let us say you are sad,

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,890
For you to laugh and leap and say you are
merry,

65
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,800
Because you are not sad.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,379
Now, by two-headed Janus,

67
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,860
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her
time:

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,840
Some that will evermore peep through their
eyes

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,830
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,

70
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,599
And other of such vinegar aspect

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,540
That they'll not show their teeth in way of
smile,

72
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,349
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

73
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,920
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO

74
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
SALANIO

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,319
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,680
Gratiano and Lorenzo.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,040
Fare ye well:

78
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,160
We leave you now with better company.

79
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
SALARINO

80
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,690
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,

81
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,060
If worthier friends had not prevented me.

82
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
ANTONIO

83
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,510
Your worth is very dear in my regard.

84
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,190
I take it, your own business calls on you

85
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,689
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

86
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,689
SALARINO

87
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,500
Good morrow, my good lords.

88
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
BASSANIO

89
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,930
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?

90
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,099
say, when?

91
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,870
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

92
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
SALARINO

93
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,690
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

94
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,341
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio

95
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,629
LORENZO

96
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:51,760
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,

97
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,950
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,

98
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,379
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

99
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,379
BASSANIO

100
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,379
I will not fail you.

101
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,379
GRATIANO

102
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,579
You look not well, Signior Antonio;

103
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,230
You have too much respect upon the world:

104
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,990
They lose it that do buy it with much care:

105
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,670
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.

106
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,670
ANTONIO

107
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,350
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;

108
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,030
A stage where every man must play a part,

109
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,729
And mine a sad one.

110
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:20,729
GRATIANO

111
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:21,729
Let me play the fool:

112
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,570
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,

113
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,820
And let my liver rather heat with wine

114
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,440
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,070
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,

116
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,050
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?

117
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,880
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
By being peevish?

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,050
I tell thee what, Antonio--

120
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,510
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--

121
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,630
There are a sort of men whose visages

122
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,710
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,

123
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,170
And do a wilful stillness entertain,

124
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,880
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,640
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,

126
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,699
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,

127
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,770
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'

128
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,850
O my Antonio, I do know of these

129
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,870
That therefore only are reputed wise

130
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,210
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,

131
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,250
If they should speak, would almost damn those
ears,

132
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,030
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers
fools.

133
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll tell thee more of this another time:

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,749
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,

135
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:30,340
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.

136
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,990
Come, good Lorenzo.

137
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,500
Fare ye well awhile:

138
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,010
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

139
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,010
LORENZO

140
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,710
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:

141
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,120
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,

142
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,960
For Gratiano never lets me speak.

143
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
GRATIANO

144
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,080
Well, keep me company but two years moe,

145
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,990
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own
tongue.

146
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,990
ANTONIO

147
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,120
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
GRATIANO

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,039
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,360
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

151
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,110
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO

152
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,110
ANTONIO

153
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,539
Is that any thing now?

154
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:09,539
BASSANIO

155
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,919
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,
more

156
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,539
than any man in all Venice.

157
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,169
His reasons are as two

158
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,479
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff:
you

159
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,139
shall seek all day ere you find them, and
when you

160
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,280
have them, they are not worth the search.

161
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
ANTONIO

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,139
Well, tell me now what lady is the same

163
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,979
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,

164
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,380
That you to-day promised to tell me of?

165
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
BASSANIO

166
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,560
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,330
How much I have disabled mine estate,

168
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,650
By something showing a more swelling port

169
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,380
Than my faint means would grant continuance:

170
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,789
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged

171
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,520
From such a noble rate; but my chief care

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,069
Is to come fairly off from the great debts

173
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,520
Wherein my time something too prodigal

174
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,930
Hath left me gaged.

175
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,059
To you, Antonio,

176
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:13,190
I owe the most, in money and in love,

177
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,330
And from your love I have a warranty

178
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,930
To unburden all my plots and purposes

179
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,850
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

180
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
ANTONIO

181
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,540
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;

182
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,150
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,

183
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,440

Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he

good man is to have you understand me that
he is

449

sufficient.

450
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,581
Yet his means are in supposition: he

hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another
to the

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:46,610

he

453
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:54,091
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England,
and

454
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:59,370
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad.

land-rats

and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves,
I

458
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:27,230
mean pirates, and then there is the peril
of waters,

winds and rocks.

I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear

I had forgot; three months; you told me so.

Well then, your bond; and let me see; but
hear you;

529
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,630
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow

535
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,450
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,470
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,

537
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,650
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--

538
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,650
ANTONIO

539
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,650
And what of him?

540
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,040
did he take interest?

541
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
SHYLOCK

542
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,080
No, not take interest, not, as you would say,

543
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,909
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.

544
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:56,419
When Laban and himself were compromised

545
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:00,400
That all the eanlings which were streak'd
and pied

546
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,470
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being
rank,

547
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,270
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,

548
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,700
And, when the work of generation was

549
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,850
Between these woolly breeders in the act,

550
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,179
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,

551
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,100
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,

552
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,279
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,

553
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,590
Who then conceiving did in eaning time

554
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,730
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were
Jacob's.

555
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,309
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:

556
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,230
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

557
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,230
ANTONIO

558
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,430
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served
for;

559
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,540
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,

560
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,620
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.

561
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,549
Was this inserted to make interest good?

562
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:52,460
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

563
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
SHYLOCK

564
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,960
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:

565
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,799
But note me, signior.

566
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,799
ANTONIO

567
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,390
Mark you this, Bassanio,

568
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,299
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.

569
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:08,740
An evil soul producing holy witness

570
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,419
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,

571
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,870
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:

572
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,210
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

573
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,210
SHYLOCK

574
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,590
Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.

575
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,220
Three months from twelve; then, let me see;
the rate--

576
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
ANTONIO

577
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,750
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

578
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,750
SHYLOCK

579
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,690
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft

580
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,380
In the Rialto you have rated me

581
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,940
About my moneys and my usances:

582
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,899
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,

583
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:42,090
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

584
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,990
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,

585
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,170
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,

586
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,750
And all for use of that which is mine own.

587
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,820
Well then, it now appears you need my help:

588
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,201
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say

589
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:03,539
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;

590
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,659
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard

591
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,210
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur

592
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,539
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit

593
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,919
What should I say to you?

594
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,409
Should I not say

595
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:17,929
'Hath a dog money? is it possible

596
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:20,669
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?'

597
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,669
Or

598
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:24,460
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,

599
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,940
With bated breath and whispering humbleness,
Say this;

600
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,789
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;

601
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:34,710
You spurn'd me such a day; another time

602
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,720
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies

603
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,070
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?

604
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,070
ANTONIO

605
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,770
I am as like to call thee so again,

606
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,080
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.

607
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,201
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not

608
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:52,350
As to thy friends; for when did friendship
take

609
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,789
A breed for barren metal of his friend?

610
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,740
But lend it rather to thine enemy,

611
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,970
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face

612
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,110
Exact the penalty.

613
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,110
SHYLOCK

614
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,149
Why, look you, how you storm!

615
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,650
I would be friends with you and have your
love,

616
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,230
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me
with,

617
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,690
Supply your present wants and take no doit

618
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,480
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear
me:

619
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,679
This is kind I offer.

620
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,679
BASSANIO

621
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,080
This were kindness.

622
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
SHYLOCK

623
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,440
This kindness will I show.

624
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,200
Go with me to a notary, seal me there

625
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,570
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,

626
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,650
If you repay me not on such a day,

627
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,799
In such a place, such sum or sums as are

628
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,380
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit

629
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,060
Be nominated for an equal pound

630
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,850
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken

631
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,650
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

632
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
ANTONIO

633
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,820
Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond

634
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,039
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

635
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,039
BASSANIO

636
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,690
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:

637
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,570
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

638
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,570
ANTONIO

639
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,539
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:

640
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,799
Within these two months, that's a month before

641
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,789
This bond expires, I do expect return

642
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:15,240
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

643
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
SHYLOCK

644
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,990
O father Abram, what these Christians are,

645
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,710
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect

646
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,500
The thoughts of others!

647
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,270
Pray you, tell me this;

648
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,590
If he should break his day, what should I
gain

649
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,630
By the exaction of the forfeiture?

650
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,320
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man

651
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,880
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,

652
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,690
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

653
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,710
I say,

654
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,160
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:

655
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,780
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;

656
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,640
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

657
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
ANTONIO

658
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,940
Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

659
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
SHYLOCK

660
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,779
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;

661
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,640
Give him direction for this merry bond,

662
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,159
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,

663
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,960
See to my house, left in the fearful guard

664
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,309
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently

665
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:16,970
I will be with you.

666
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,970
ANTONIO

667
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,470
Hie thee, gentle Jew.

668
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,470
Exit Shylock

669
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,500
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

670
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
BASSANIO

671
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,750
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

672
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,750
ANTONIO

673
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,920
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;

674
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:49,360
My ships come home a month before 

675
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
the day.

676
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Exeunt

677
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
ACT 2

678
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Scene 1

679
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Belmont.

680
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,450
A room in PORTIA'S house.

681
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:08,159
Flourish of cornets.

682
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:17,980
Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train;
PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending

683
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,040
MOROCCO

684
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,460
Mislike me not for my complexion,

685
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,240
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,

686
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,559
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

687
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,110
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,

688
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,500
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,

689
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,169
And let us make incision for your love,

690
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,370
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.

691
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,429
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine

692
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,250
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear

693
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,480
The best-regarded virgins of our clime

694
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,440
Have loved it too: I would not change this
hue,

695
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,850
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

696
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,850
PORTIA

697
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,130
In terms of choice I am not solely led

698
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,460
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;

699
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,210
Besides, the lottery of my destiny

700
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,299
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:

701
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:07,890
But if my father had not scanted me

702
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,410
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself

703
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,870
His wife who wins me by that means I told
you,

704
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,679
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair

705
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,179
As any comer I have look'd on yet

706
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,330
For my affection.

707
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,330
MOROCCO

708
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,809
Even for that I thank you:

709
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,130
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets

710
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,789
To try my fortune.

711
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:27,789
By this scimitar

712
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:30,409
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince

713
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:33,610
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,

714
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,289
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,

715
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:40,350
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,

716
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,710
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,

717
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,830
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,

718
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,460
To win thee, lady.

719
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,279
But, alas the while!

720
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,690
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice

721
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,149
Which is the better man, the greater throw

722
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,169
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:

723
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:01,230
So is Alcides beaten by his page;

724
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,610
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,

725
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,240
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,

726
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,330
And die with grieving.

727
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,330
PORTIA

728
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,359
You must take your chance,

729
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,830
And either not attempt to choose at all

730
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,799
Or swear before you choose, if you choose
wrong

731
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,490
Never to speak to lady afterward

732
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,419
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.

733
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,419
MOROCCO

734
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:23,470
Nor will not.

735
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,690
Come, bring me unto my chance.

736
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,690
PORTIA

737
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,480
First, forward to the temple: after dinner

738
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,130
Your hazard shall be made.

739
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,130
MOROCCO

740
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,130
Good fortune then!

741
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,360
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.

742
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,910
Cornets, and exeunt

743
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,910
Scene 2

744
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,910
Venice.

745
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,910
A street.

746
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,910
Enter LAUNCELOT

747
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,910
LAUNCELOT

748
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,910
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run
from

749
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,320
this Jew my master.

750
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,909
The fiend is at mine elbow and

751
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:56,070
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo,
good

752
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,990
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot

753
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:07,779
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run
away.

754
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:08,779
My

755
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:12,730
conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;

756
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,500
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid,
'honest

757
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,990
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running
with thy

758
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,059
heels.'

759
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,360
Well, the most courageous fiend bids me

760
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,520
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says
the

761
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,380
fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave
mind,'

762
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,090
says the fiend, 'and run.'

763
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,650
Well, my conscience,

764
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,480
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very
wisely

765
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,419
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an
honest

766
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:04,550
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son;
for,

767
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:10,490
indeed, my father did something smack, something

768
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:20,080
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my
conscience

769
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,429
says 'Launcelot, budge not.'

770
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,190
'Budge,' says the

771
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,190
fiend.

772
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,110
'Budge not,' says my conscience.

773
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:36,380
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'

774
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,049
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by
my

775
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:45,270
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my
master,

776
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:52,200
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil;
and, to

777
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,269
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by
the

778
00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:03,899
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the
devil

779
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:04,980
himself.

780
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,990
Certainly the Jew is the very devil

781
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,659
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience
is

782
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,970
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to
counsel

783
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,909
me to stay with the Jew.

784
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,480
The fiend gives the more

785
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,330
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels
are

786
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,550
at your command; I will run.

787
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,550
Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket

788
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,609
GOBBO

789
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,659
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is
the way

790
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,430
to master Jew's?

791
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,430
LAUNCELOT

792
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:49,040
[Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten
father!

793
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,679
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel
blind,

794
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,350
knows me not: I will try confusions with him.

795
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,350
GOBBO

796
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,750
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which
is the way

797
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,869
to master Jew's?

798
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,869
LAUNCELOT

799
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:11,140
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning,
but,

800
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,820
at the next turning of all, on your left;
marry, at

801
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,600
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but
turn

802
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,270
down indirectly to the Jew's house.

803
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,270
GOBBO

804
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,310
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to
hit.

805
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,310
Can

806
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,050
you tell me whether one Launcelot,

807
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,349
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?

808
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:37,369
LAUNCELOT

809
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,840
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

810
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Aside

811
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,990
Mark me now; now will I raise the waters.

812
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,990
Talk you

813
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,380
of young Master Launcelot?

814
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,380
GOBBO

815
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,720
No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his
father,

816
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,790
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor
man

817
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,950
and, God be thanked, well to live.

818
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,950
LAUNCELOT

819
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,990
Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk
of

820
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,960
young Master Launcelot.

821
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
GOBBO

822
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,670
Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.

823
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,670
LAUNCELOT

824
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,640
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech
you,

825
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,720
talk you of young Master Launcelot?

826
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,740
GOBBO

827
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,030
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.

828
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,060
LAUNCELOT

829
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,170
Ergo, Master Launcelot.

830
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,040
Talk not of Master

831
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,849
Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,

832
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:42,740
according to Fates and Destinies and such
odd

833
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:49,020
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches
of

834
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,180
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would
say

835
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,670
in plain terms, gone to heaven.

836
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,670
GOBBO

837
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,460
Marry, God forbid!

838
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,940
the boy was the very staff of my

839
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,150
age, my very prop.

840
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,150
LAUNCELOT

841
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,550
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a
staff or

842
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,849
a prop?

843
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,880
Do you know me, father?

844
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
GOBBO

845
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,170
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:

846
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,550
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest
his

847
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,630
soul, alive or dead?

848
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,630
LAUNCELOT

849
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,160
Do you not know me, father?

850
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
GOBBO

851
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,329
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.

852
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,329
LAUNCELOT

853
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,090
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might
fail of

854
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,780
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows
his

855
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,320
own child.

856
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,250
Well, old man, I will tell you news of

857
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,369
your son: give me your blessing: truth will
come

858
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:01,359
to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's
son

859
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,070
may, but at the length truth will out.

860
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
GOBBO

861
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,760
Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are
not

862
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,560
Launcelot, my boy.

863
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
LAUNCELOT

864
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,859
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about
it, but

865
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:20,060
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your
boy

866
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,511
that was, your son that is, your child that
shall

867
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,511
be.

868
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,511
GOBBO

869
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,770
I cannot think you are my son.

870
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,770
LAUNCELOT

871
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,220
I know not what I shall think of that: but
I am

872
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,400
Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery
your

873
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
wife is my mother.

874
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
GOBBO

875
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,829
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn,
if thou

876
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:47,849
be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and
blood.

877
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,740
Lord worshipped might he be!

878
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,880
what a beard hast thou

879
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
got!

880
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,829
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than

881
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:58,250
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

882
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,250
LAUNCELOT

883
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,800
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows

884
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,950
backward: I am sure he had more hair of his
tail

885
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,650
than I have of my face when I last saw him.

886
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,650
GOBBO

887
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,380
Lord, how art thou changed!

888
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,660
How dost thou and thy

889
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,030
master agree?

890
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,390
I have brought him a present.

891
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,390
How

892
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,390
'gree you now?

893
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,390
LAUNCELOT

894
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,290
Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have
set

895
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,830
up my rest to run away, so I will not rest
till I

896
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,470
have run some ground.

897
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,920
My master's a very Jew: give

898
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,690
him a present!

899
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,210
give him a halter: I am famished in

900
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:48,231
his service; you may tell every finger I have
with

901
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:49,460
my ribs.

902
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:56,829
Father, I am glad you are come: give me

903
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:01,170
your present to one Master Bassanio, who,
indeed,

904
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:06,200
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him,
I

905
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,619
will run as far as God has any ground.

906
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,380
O rare

907
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,380
fortune!

908
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,609
here comes the man: to him, father; for I

909
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:21,150
am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.

910
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,200
Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers

911
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
BASSANIO

912
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that
supper

913
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,970
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.

914
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,970
See

915
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,700
these letters delivered; put the liveries
to making,

916
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,599
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

917
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,930
Exit a Servant

918
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,930
LAUNCELOT

919
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,930
To him, father.

920
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,930
GOBBO

921
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,930
God bless your worship!

922
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,930
BASSANIO

923
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,930
Gramercy!

924
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,930
wouldst thou aught with me?

925
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,930
GOBBO

926
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,550
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--

927
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,550
LAUNCELOT

928
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,060
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man;
that

929
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,490
would, sir, as my father shall specify--

930
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,490
GOBBO

931
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,770
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would
say, to serve--

932
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,770
LAUNCELOT

933
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,720
Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve
the Jew,

934
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,329
and have a desire, as my father shall specify--

935
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:16,380
GOBBO

936
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,569
His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,

937
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:22,569
are scarce cater-cousins--

938
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:23,630
LAUNCELOT

939
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,900
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew,
having

940
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,150
done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father,
being, I

941
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,290
hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--

942
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,290
GOBBO

943
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,820
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow
upon

944
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,770
your worship, and my suit is--

945
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,770
LAUNCELOT

946
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:53,170
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to
myself, as

947
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,030
your worship shall know by this honest old
man; and,

948
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:03,650
though I say it, though old man, yet poor
man, my father.

949
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,119
BASSANIO

950
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,840
One speak for both.

951
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
What would you?

952
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
LAUNCELOT

953
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Serve you, sir.

954
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
GOBBO

955
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,630
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

956
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,630
BASSANIO

957
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,520
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:

958
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,339
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,

959
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,190
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment

960
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,700
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become

961
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,110
The follower of so poor a gentleman.

962
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,110
LAUNCELOT

963
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,270
The old proverb is very well parted between
my

964
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,510
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the
grace of

965
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,099
God, sir, and he hath enough.

966
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,099
BASSANIO

967
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,920
Thou speak'st it well.

968
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,400
Go, father, with thy son.

969
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,900
Take leave of thy old master and inquire

970
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,880
My lodging out.

971
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
Give him a livery

972
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,940
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

973
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
LAUNCELOT

974
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,980
Father, in.

975
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,470
I cannot get a service, no; I have

976
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:09,460
ne'er a tongue in my head.

977
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,650
Well, if any man in

978
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,430
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer
to swear

979
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,260
upon a book, I shall have good fortune.

980
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,359
Go to,

981
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,859
here's a simple line of life: here's a small
trifle

982
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:29,660
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing!

983
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
eleven

984
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:38,300
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in
for one

985
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,080
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and
to be

986
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:50,080
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;

987
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,300
here are simple scapes.

988
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,380
Well, if Fortune be a

989
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,310
woman, she's a good wench for this gear.

990
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,310
Father,

991
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,920
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the
twinkling of an eye.

992
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,450
Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo

993
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,450
BASSANIO

994
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,960
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:

995
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,780
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,

996
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,119
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night

997
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,550
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

998
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,550
LEONARDO

999
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,579
My best endeavours shall be done herein.

1000
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:27,730
Enter GRATIANO

1001
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,730
GRATIANO

1002
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,730
Where is your master?

1003
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,730
LEONARDO

1004
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,730
Yonder, sir, he walks.

1005
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,730
Exit

1006
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,730
GRATIANO

1007
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,730
Signior Bassanio!

1008
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,730
BASSANIO

1009
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,730
Gratiano!

1010
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,730
GRATIANO

1011
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,730
I have a suit to you.

1012
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,730
BASSANIO

1013
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:40,730
You have obtain'd it.

1014
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,730
GRATIANO

1015
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,730
You must not deny me: I must go with you to
Belmont.

1016
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,730
BASSANIO

1017
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,290
Why then you must.

1018
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,530
But hear thee, Gratiano;

1019
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:52,730
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;

1020
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,809
Parts that become thee happily enough

1021
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:58,590
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;

1022
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:03,341
But where thou art not known, why, there they
show

1023
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:05,940
Something too liberal.

1024
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,900
Pray thee, take pain

1025
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,410
To allay with some cold drops of modesty

1026
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,720
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild
behavior

1027
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,110
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,

1028
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,300
And lose my hopes.

1029
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,300
GRATIANO

1030
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,160
Signior Bassanio, hear me:

1031
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,349
If I do not put on a sober habit,

1032
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,210
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,

1033
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,430
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,

1034
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,970
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine
eyes

1035
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,020
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'

1036
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,460
Use all the observance of civility,

1037
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,780
Like one well studied in a sad ostent

1038
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,350
To please his grandam, never trust me more.

1039
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,350
BASSANIO

1040
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,079
Well, we shall see your bearing.

1041
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,079
GRATIANO

1042
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,180
Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge
me

1043
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,930
By what we do to-night.

1044
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,930
BASSANIO

1045
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,060
No, that were pity:

1046
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,240
I would entreat you rather to put on

1047
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,579
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends

1048
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,210
That purpose merriment.

1049
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,320
But fare you well:

1050
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,710
I have some business.

1051
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,710
GRATIANO

1052
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,550
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:

1053
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,450
But we will visit you at supper-time.

1054
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,450
Exeunt

1055
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,640
Scene 3

1056
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
The same.

A room in SHYLOCK'S house.

1058
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT

JESSICA

1060
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,700
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:

1061
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,530
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,

1062
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,470
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.

1063
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,710
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:

1064
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,970
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou
see

1065
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,819
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:

1066
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:40,670
Give him this letter; do it secretly;

1067
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,600
And so farewell: I would not have my father

1068
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,809
See me in talk with thee.

1070
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,809
Adieu!

1071
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:50,300
tears exhibit my tongue.

1072
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,300
Most beautiful

1073
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,650
pagan, most sweet Jew!

1074
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,410
if a Christian did not play

1075
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,640
the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.

1076
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,000
But,

1077
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,161
adieu: these foolish drops do something drown
my

1078
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,820
manly spirit: adieu.

Farewell, good Launcelot.

Exit Launcelot

1082
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,520
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me

1083
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,650
To be ashamed to be my father's child!

1084
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,810
But though I am a daughter to his blood,

1085
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,040
I am not to his manners.

1086
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,470
O Lorenzo,

1087
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,720
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,

1088
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,000
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.

1089

A street.

Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,

Disguise us at my lodging and return,

SALARINO

1101
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,550
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

1102
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,550
SALANIO

1103
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,849
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,

1104
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,890
And better in my mind not undertook.

'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours

1108

Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter

1109
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,220
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

1110
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,220
LAUNCELOT

LORENZO

1114
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,540
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;

1115
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,589
And whiter than the paper it writ on

1116
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,620
Is the fair hand that writ.

1117
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,620
GRATIANO

1118
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,040

LAUNCELOT

1124
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,339
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the

Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica

00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:48,599
I will not fail her; speak it privately.

Go, gentlemen,

Exit Launcelot

Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?

I am provided of a torch-bearer.

1133

SALANIO

1134
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,020
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

SALANIO

Meet me and Gratiano

LORENZO

1146
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,150
I must needs tell thee all.

1147
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,160
She hath directed

How I shall take her from her father's house,

What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,

1150
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,450
What page's suit she hath in readiness.

1151
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,940
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,

1152
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,670
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:

1153
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,119
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,

1154
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:43,349
Unless she do it under this excuse,

1155
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:47,520
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.

The same.

1161
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:00,069
Before SHYLOCK'S house.

1162
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:01,109
Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT

1163
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:02,109
SHYLOCK

1164
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:05,900
Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy
judge,

1165
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,680
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--

1166
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,250
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,

1167
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,210
As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--

1168
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:22,150
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--

1169
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,980
Why, Jessica, I say!

1170
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,980
LAUNCELOT

1171
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,980
Why, Jessica!

1172
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,980
SHYLOCK

1173
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,069
Who bids thee call?

1174
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,280
I do not bid thee call.

1175
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,280
LAUNCELOT

1176
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,971
Your worship was wont to tell me that

1177
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:36,849
I could do nothing without bidding.

1178
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:37,849
Enter Jessica

1179
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:38,849
JESSICA

Call you?

1181
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:40,849
what is your will?

1182
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:41,849
SHYLOCK

1183
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:42,849
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:

1184
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:45,360
There are my keys.

1185
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
But wherefore should I go?

1186
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,980
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:

1187
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,400
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon

1188
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,809
The prodigal Christian.

1189
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:01,119
Jessica, my girl,

1190
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,339
Look to my house.

1191
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,940
I am right loath to go:

1192
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,589
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,

1193
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:11,829
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

1194
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:12,829
LAUNCELOT

1195
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:18,200
I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth
expect

1196
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,589
your reproach.

1197
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:20,589
SHYLOCK

1198
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:22,049
So do I his.

1199
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:23,049
LAUNCELOT

1200
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:27,880
An they have conspired together, I will not
say you

1201
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,280
shall see a masque; but if you do, then it
was not

1202
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,850
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on

1203
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:43,270
Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,

1204
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:47,910
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was
four

1205
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,650
year, in the afternoon.

1206
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,650
SHYLOCK

1207
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,069
What, are there masques?

1208
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,609
Hear you me, Jessica:

1209
00:51:56,609 --> 00:51:59,740
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum

1210
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,270
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,

1211
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:07,559
Clamber not you up to the casements then,

1212
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,809
Nor thrust your head into the public street

1213
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:15,560
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd
faces,

1214
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,640
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:

1215
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,530
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter

1216
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,220
My sober house.

1217
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,079
By Jacob's staff, I swear,

1218
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,280
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:

1219
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,390
But I will go.

1220
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,290
Go you before me, sirrah;

1221
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,559
Say I will come.

1222
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:40,559
LAUNCELOT

1223
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,040
I will go before, sir.

1224
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,300
Mistress, look out at

1225
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,470
window, for all this, There will come a Christian

1226
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,930
boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

1227
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,930
Exit

1228
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:53,930
SHYLOCK

1229
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,890
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring,
ha?

1230
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,890
JESSICA

1231
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,280
His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing
else.

1232
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
SHYLOCK

1233
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,830
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;

1234
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,799
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day

1235
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:13,619
More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with
me;

1236
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:16,940
Therefore I part with him, and part with him

1237
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,200
To one that would have him help to waste

1238
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880
His borrow'd purse.

1239
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,020
Well, Jessica, go in;

1240
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,430
Perhaps I will return immediately:

1241
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:32,150
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:

1242
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,699
Fast bind, fast find;

1243
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:37,829
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

1244
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:38,829
Exit

1245
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:39,829
JESSICA

1246
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:41,310
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,

1247
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,040
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

1248
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Exit

1249
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Scene 6

1250
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
The same.

1251
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,589
Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued

1252
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:49,589
GRATIANO

1253
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:50,799
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo

1254
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:52,660
Desired us to make stand.

1255
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,660
SALARINO

1256
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,040
His hour is almost past.

1257
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
GRATIANO

1258
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,520
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,

1259
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,190
For lovers ever run before the clock.

SALARINO

1261
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,260
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly

1262
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,440
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are
wont

1263
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,780
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

1264
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
GRATIANO

1265
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,150
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast

1266
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,299
With that keen appetite that he sits down?

1267
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:19,180
Where is the horse that doth untread again

1268
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,280
His tedious measures with the unbated fire

1269
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,720
That he did pace them first?

1270
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,891
All things that are,

1271
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:28,859
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.

1272
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:30,640
How like a younker or a prodigal

1273
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,140
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,

1274
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,480
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!

1275
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,970
How like the prodigal doth she return,

1276
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,619
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,

1277
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:45,820
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

1278
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,380
SALARINO

1279
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,420
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

1280
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,420
Enter LORENZO

1281
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,420
LORENZO

1282
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,680
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;

1283
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,380
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:

1284
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,960
When you shall please to play the thieves
for wives,

1285
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,890
I'll watch as long for you then.

1286
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,890
Approach;

1287
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,030
Here dwells my father Jew.

1288
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,030
Ho!

1289
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,030
who's within?

1290
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,359
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes

1291
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:15,359
JESSICA

1292
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,460
Who are you?

1293
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,010
Tell me, for more certainty,

1294
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:22,200
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

1295
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,200
LORENZO

1296
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,660
Lorenzo, and thy love.

1297
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,660
JESSICA

1298
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,299
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,

1299
00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:30,109
For who love I so much?

1300
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:31,109
And now who knows

1301
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:35,480
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

1302
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
LORENZO

1303
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,770
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou
art.

1304
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,770
JESSICA

1305
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,820
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.

1306
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,589
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,

1307
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:48,850
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:

1308
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,329
But love is blind and lovers cannot see

1309
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:54,160
The pretty follies that themselves commit;

1310
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,329
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush

1311
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:00,480
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

1312
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,480
LORENZO

1313
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,839
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

1314
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,839
JESSICA

1315
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,930
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?

1316
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,260
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too
light.

1317
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,839
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;

1318
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,060
And I should be obscured.

1319
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,060
LORENZO

1320
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,930
So are you, sweet,

1321
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:21,540
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

1322
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,930
But come at once;

1323
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,290
For the close night doth play the runaway,

1324
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,920
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

1325
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
JESSICA

1326
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,079
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself

1327
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,160
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

1328
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
Exit above

1329
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
GRATIANO

1330
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,030
Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

1331
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,030
LORENZO

1332
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,849
Beshrew me but I love her heartily;

1333
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:46,520
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,

1334
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,120
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,

1335
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,920
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,

1336
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,829
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and
true,

1337
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:03,049
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

1338
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,539
Enter JESSICA, below

1339
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:07,089
What, art thou come?

1340
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,000
On, gentlemen; away!

1341
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,530
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

1342
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,250
Exit with Jessica and Salarino

1343
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,250
Enter ANTONIO

1344
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,250
ANTONIO

1345
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,299
Who's there?

1346
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:21,299
GRATIANO

1347
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:22,299
Signior Antonio!

1348
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:23,299
ANTONIO

1349
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:24,299
Fie, fie, Gratiano!

1350
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:25,299
where are all the rest?

1351
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:28,820
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for
you.

1352
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,680
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;

1353
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,960
Bassanio presently will go aboard:

1354
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,400
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

1355
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
GRATIANO

1356
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,390
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight

1357
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,700
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

1358
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,700
Exeunt

1359
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,700
Scene 7

1360
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Belmont.

1361
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1362
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Flourish of cornets.

1363
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,079
Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO,
and their trains

1364
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,079
PORTIA

1365
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,280
Go draw aside the curtains and discover

1366
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,630
The several caskets to this noble prince.

1367
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,450
Now make your choice.

1368
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,450
MOROCCO

1369
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,540
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,

1370
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:03,240
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men
desire;'

1371
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,300
The second, silver, which this promise carries,

1372
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:11,289
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'

1373
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:15,780
This third, dull lead, with warning all as
blunt,

1374
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:20,609
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all
he hath.'

1375
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:22,990
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

1376
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:23,990
PORTIA

1377
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,890
The one of them contains my picture, prince:

1378
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,010
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

1379
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,010
MOROCCO

1380
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,849
Some god direct my judgment!

1381
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:33,380
Let me see;

1382
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,809
I will survey the inscriptions back again.

1383
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:38,500
What says this leaden casket?

1384
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:43,260
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all
he hath.'

1385
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,700
Must give: for what? for lead?

1386
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,580
hazard for lead?

1387
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,470
This casket threatens.

1388
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,599
Men that hazard all

1389
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,390
Do it in hope of fair advantages:

1390
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,190
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;

1391
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,960
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.

1392
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,750
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

1393
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,859
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'

1394
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,260
As much as he deserves!

1395
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,599
Pause there, Morocco,

1396
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:13,359
And weigh thy value with an even hand:

1397
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,990
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,

1398
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,780
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough

1399
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,990
May not extend so far as to the lady:

1400
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,250
And yet to be afeard of my deserving

1401
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,289
Were but a weak disabling of myself.

1402
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:28,880
As much as I deserve!

1403
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,900
Why, that's the lady:

1404
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,940
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

1405
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,849
In graces and in qualities of breeding;

1406
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:40,339
But more than these, in love I do deserve.

1407
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:44,580
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?

1408
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,930
Let's see once more this saying graved in
gold

1409
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:50,430
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men
desire.'

1410
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:54,700
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires
her;

1411
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,400
From the four corners of the earth they come,

1412
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,750
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing
saint:

1413
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,630
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds

1414
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,819
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now

1415
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:10,220
For princes to come view fair Portia:

1416
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,380
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head

1417
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,770
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar

1418
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:17,569
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,

1419
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:20,890
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.

1420
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,599
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.

1421
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,080
Is't like that lead contains her?

1422
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,089
'Twere damnation

1423
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:29,990
To think so base a thought: it were too gross

1424
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,640
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.

1425
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,500
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,

1426
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,349
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?

1427
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,670
O sinful thought!

1428
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,670
Never so rich a gem

1429
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,530
Was set in worse than gold.

1430
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:45,970
They have in England

1431
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,240
A coin that bears the figure of an angel

1432
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,349
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;

1433
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:53,960
But here an angel in a golden bed

1434
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,589
Lies all within.

1435
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:57,200
Deliver me the key:

1436
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,720
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

1437
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
PORTIA

1438
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,910
There, take it, prince; and if my form lie
there,

1439
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,910
Then I am yours.

1440
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,119
He unlocks the golden casket

1441
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:09,119
MOROCCO

1442
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,119
O hell!

1443
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:11,119
what have we here?

1444
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,559
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye

1445
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:14,559
There is a written scroll!

1446
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,559
I'll read the writing.

1447
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:16,559
Reads

1448
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,280
All that glitters is not gold;

1449
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,470
Often have you heard that told:

1450
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,359
Many a man his life hath sold

1451
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:27,460
But my outside to behold:

1452
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,980
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

1453
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,230
Had you been as wise as bold,

1454
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,630
Young in limbs, in judgment old,

1455
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:37,340
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:

1456
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,589
Fare you well; your suit is cold.

1457
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:43,809
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:

1458
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:47,070
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!

1459
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,250
Portia, adieu.

1460
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,480
I have too grieved a heart

1461
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,029
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

1462
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,329
Exit with his train.

1463
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:58,430
Flourish of cornets

1464
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,430
PORTIA

1465
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,230
A gentle riddance.

1466
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,590
Draw the curtains, go.

1467
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,980
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

1468
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,980
Exeunt

1469
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,980
Scene 8

1470
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,980
Venice.

1471
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,980
A street.

1472
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,980
Enter SALARINO and SALANIO

1473
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,980
SALARINO

1474
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,320
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:

1475
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,690
With him is Gratiano gone along;

1476
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:19,130
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

1477
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,130
SALANIO

1478
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,920
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,

1479
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,430
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

1480
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,430
SALARINO

1481
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,609
He came too late, the ship was under sail:

1482
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:31,720
But there the duke was given to understand

1483
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,140
That in a gondola were seen together

1484
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,099
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:

1485
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:41,319
Besides, Antonio certified the duke

1486
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:43,930
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

1487
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:44,930
SALANIO

1488
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,950
I never heard a passion so confused,

1489
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,950
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,

1490
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,289
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:

1491
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:53,289
'My daughter!

1492
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:54,430
O my ducats!

1493
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,119
O my daughter!

1494
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:57,119
Fled with a Christian!

1495
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,280
O my Christian ducats!

1496
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,280
Justice!

1497
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
the law!

1498
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,599
my ducats, and my daughter!

1499
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:06,010
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,

1500
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:09,490
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!

1501
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:13,529
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious
stones,

1502
01:03:13,529 --> 01:03:15,130
Stolen by my daughter!

1503
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,130
Justice!

1504
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,130
find the girl;

1505
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,350
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

1506
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,350
SALARINO

1507
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,510
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,

1508
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:25,980
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his
ducats.

1509
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,980
SALANIO

1510
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,609
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,

1511
01:03:29,609 --> 01:03:31,030
Or he shall pay for this.

1512
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,030
SALARINO

1513
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,250
Marry, well remember'd.

1514
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,510
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,

1515
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,270
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part

1516
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,050
The French and English, there miscarried

1517
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,180
A vessel of our country richly fraught:

1518
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,349
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;

1519
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:49,060
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

1520
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,060
SALANIO

1521
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,619
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;

1522
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:55,430
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

1523
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,430
SALARINO

1524
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,680
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.

1525
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,359
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:

1526
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:04,809
Bassanio told him he would make some speed

1527
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:08,279
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;

1528
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,971
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio

1529
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:13,819
But stay the very riping of the time;

1530
01:04:13,819 --> 01:04:17,380
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,

1531
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,079
Let it not enter in your mind of love:

1532
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,720
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts

1533
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,290
To courtship and such fair ostents of love

1534
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:29,890
As shall conveniently become you there:'

1535
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:33,180
And even there, his eye being big with tears,

1536
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,410
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,

1537
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,130
And with affection wondrous sensible

1538
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:42,680
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

1539
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,680
SALANIO

1540
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,799
I think he only loves the world for him.

1541
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:48,450
I pray thee, let us go and find him out

1542
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,369
And quicken his embraced heaviness

1543
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,039
With some delight or other.

1544
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:53,039
SALARINO

1545
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,480
Do we so.

1546
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,480
Exeunt

1547
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,480
Scene 9

1548
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,480
Belmont.

1549
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,480
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1550
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Enter NERISSA with a Servitor

1551
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
NERISSA

1552
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,770
Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain
straight:

1553
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,109
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,

1554
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,010
And comes to his election presently.

1555
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,349
Flourish of cornets.

1556
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:09,041
Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their
trains

1557
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,041
PORTIA

1558
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:17,029
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:

1559
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:19,680
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,

1560
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,460
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:

1561
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,220
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,

1562
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,119
You must be gone from hence immediately.

1563
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,119
ARRAGON

1564
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:31,730
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:

1565
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:34,549
First, never to unfold to any one

1566
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:38,940
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail

1567
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,880
Of the right casket, never in my life

1568
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,640
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,

1569
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,140
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,

1570
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,520
Immediately to leave you and be gone.

1571
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,520
PORTIA

1572
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,430
To these injunctions every one doth swear

1573
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,799
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

1574
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:56,799
ARRAGON

1575
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,710
And so have I address'd me.

1576
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,710
Fortune now

1577
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,390
To my heart's hope!

1578
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,839
Gold; silver; and base lead.

1579
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:11,690
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all
he hath.'

1580
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,619
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.

1581
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,359
What says the golden chest?

1582
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,339
ha! let me see:

1583
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:24,650
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men
desire.'

1584
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,990
What many men desire!

1585
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,099
that 'many' may be meant

1586
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:32,240
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,

1587
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,430
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;

1588
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:39,430
Which pries not to the interior, but, like
the martlet,

1589
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,170
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,

1590
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,150
Even in the force and road of casualty.

1591
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,470
I will not choose what many men desire,

1592
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,170
Because I will not jump with common spirits

1593
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,360
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.

1594
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:58,240
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;

1595
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,770
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:

1596
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:07,190
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'

1597
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,349
And well said too; for who shall go about

1598
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:12,390
To cozen fortune and be honourable

1599
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,270
Without the stamp of merit?

1600
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,710
Let none presume

1601
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,700
To wear an undeserved dignity.

1602
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,839
O, that estates, degrees and offices

1603
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,240
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear
honour

1604
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,390
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!

1605
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,600
How many then should cover that stand bare!

1606
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,760
How many be commanded that command!

1607
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,400
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd

1608
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,400
From the true seed of honour! and how much
honour

1609
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,349
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times

1610
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:45,349
To be new-varnish'd!

1611
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:48,930
Well, but to my choice:

1612
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:52,619
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'

1613
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:54,809
I will assume desert.

1614
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,400
Give me a key for this,

1615
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,839
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

1616
01:07:58,839 --> 01:07:59,839
He opens the silver casket

1617
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:00,839
PORTIA

1618
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:01,850
Too long a pause for that which you find there.

1619
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,850
ARRAGON

1620
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:03,850
What's here?

1621
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,190
the portrait of a blinking idiot,

1622
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,140
Presenting me a schedule!

1623
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,160
I will read it.

1624
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,940
How much unlike art thou to Portia!

1625
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,150
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!

1626
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:20,560
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he
deserves.'

1627
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,540
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

1628
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,319
Is that my prize?

1629
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,140
are my deserts no better?

1630
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,140
PORTIA

1631
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,310
To offend, and judge, are distinct offices

1632
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,799
And of opposed natures.

1633
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:32,799
ARRAGON

1634
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:33,799
What is here?

1635
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:34,799
Reads

1636
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,140
The fire seven times tried this:

1637
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,700
Seven times tried that judgment is,

1638
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,040
That did never choose amiss.

1639
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,659
Some there be that shadows kiss;

1640
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:49,390
Such have but a shadow's bliss:

1641
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:52,160
There be fools alive, I wis,

1642
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,580
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.

1643
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,640
Take what wife you will to bed,

1644
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,540
I will ever be your head:

1645
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:03,450
So be gone: you are sped.

1646
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,409
Still more fool I shall appear

1647
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:07,390
By the time I linger here

1648
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,810
With one fool's head I came to woo,

1649
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,560
But I go away with two.

1650
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,310
Sweet, adieu.

1651
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,560
I'll keep my oath,

1652
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,420
Patiently to bear my wroth.

1653
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,580
Exeunt Arragon and train

1654
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,580
PORTIA

1655
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,440
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.

1656
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,000
O, these deliberate fools!

1657
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,560
when they do choose,

1658
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,640
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

1659
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,640
NERISSA

1660
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,299
The ancient saying is no heresy,

1661
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:37,040
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

1662
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,040
PORTIA

1663
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,609
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.

1664
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,609
Enter a Servant

1665
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:42,609
Servant

1666
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:43,609
Where is my lady?

1667
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:44,609
PORTIA

1668
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:45,609
Here: what would my lord?

1669
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:46,609
Servant

1670
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:47,609
Madam, there is alighted at your gate

1671
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:48,609
A young Venetian, one that comes before

1672
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:50,909
To signify the approaching of his lord;

1673
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:53,759
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,

1674
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,470
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,

1675
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,280
Gifts of rich value.

1676
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,350
Yet I have not seen

1677
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,350
So likely an ambassador of love:

1678
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,980
A day in April never came so sweet,

1679
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,510
To show how costly summer was at hand,

1680
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,929
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

1681
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:09,929
PORTIA

1682
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:12,370
No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard

1683
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:15,810
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,

1684
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,800
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising
him.

1685
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,120
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see

1686
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,870
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

1687
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,870
NERISSA

1688
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:31,920
Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!

1689
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
Exeunt

1690
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:39,050
ACT 3

1691
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:45,990
Scene 1

1692
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,460
Venice.

1693
01:10:49,460 --> 01:11:04,489
A street.

1694
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:06,830
Enter SALANIO and SALARINO

1695
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:07,830
SALANIO

1696
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,210
Now, what news on the Rialto?

1697
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,210
SALARINO

1698
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:13,620
Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio
hath

1699
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,940
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow
seas;

1700
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,540
the Goodwins, I think they call the place;
a very

1701
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,000
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses
of many

1702
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,360
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my
gossip

1703
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,000
Report be an honest woman of her word.

1704
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
SALANIO

1705
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,580
I would she were as lying a gossip in that
as ever

1706
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,530
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe
she

1707
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:39,280
wept for the death of a third husband.

1708
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,280
But it is

1709
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,110
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing
the

1710
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:46,830
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,
the

1711
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,860
honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good
enough

1712
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,600
to keep his name company!--

1713
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
SALARINO

1714
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,010
Come, the full stop.

1715
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,010
SALANIO

1716
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,010
Ha!

1717
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,010
what sayest thou?

1718
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,370
Why, the end is, he hath

1719
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:59,370
lost a ship.

1720
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,370
SALARINO

1721
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,450
I would it might prove the end of his losses.

1722
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,450
SALANIO

1723
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,630
Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil
cross my

1724
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,540
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness
of a Jew.

1725
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,540
Enter SHYLOCK

1726
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,540
How now, Shylock!

1727
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,440
what news among the merchants?

1728
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,780
SHYLOCK

1729
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:19,000
You know, none so well, none so well as you,
of my

1730
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,010
daughter's flight.

1731
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,010
SALARINO

1732
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,800
That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor

1733
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,940
that made the wings she flew withal.

1734
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,940
SALANIO

1735
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,820
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird
was

1736
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,120
fledged; and then it is the complexion of
them all

1737
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,620
to leave the dam.

1738
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,620
SHYLOCK

1739
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,860
She is damned for it.

1740
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,860
SALANIO

1741
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,860
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.

1742
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,860
SHYLOCK

1743
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,650
My own flesh and blood to rebel!

1744
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,650
SALANIO

1745
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,060
Out upon it, old carrion!

1746
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,770
rebels it at these years?

1747
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,770
SHYLOCK

1748
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:54,199
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.

1749
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,199
SALARINO

1750
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,231
There is more difference between thy flesh
and hers

1751
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:01,730
than between jet and ivory; more between your
bloods

1752
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:05,130
than there is between red wine and rhenish.

1753
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,130
But

1754
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,160
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have
had any

1755
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,150
loss at sea or no?

1756
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,150
SHYLOCK

1757
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:15,460
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt,
a

1758
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:20,620
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on
the

1759
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:26,020
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so
smug upon

1760
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:29,949
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to

1761
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:33,679
call me usurer; let him look to his bond:
he was

1762
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,650
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy;
let him

1763
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,460
look to his bond.

1764
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,460
SALARINO

1765
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,390
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not
take

1766
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:46,429
his flesh: what's that good for?

1767
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:47,429
SHYLOCK

1768
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:52,130
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing
else,

1769
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:55,590
it will feed my revenge.

1770
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,659
He hath disgraced me, and

1771
01:13:58,659 --> 01:14:03,380
hindered me half a million; laughed at my
losses,

1772
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:09,350
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted
my

1773
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:14,650
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine

1774
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,210
enemies; and what's his reason?

1775
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,250
I am a Jew.

1776
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,429
Hath

1777
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:24,450
not a Jew eyes?

1778
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:29,530
hath not a Jew hands, organs,

1779
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:34,400
dimensions, senses, affections, passions?

1780
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,679
fed with

1781
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:41,389
the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
subject

1782
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:46,770
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,

1783
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:49,989
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer,
as

1784
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:53,540
a Christian is?

1785
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:56,239
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

1786
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:00,310
if you tickle us, do we not laugh?

1787
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:01,310
if you poison

1788
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:06,430
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall
we not

1789
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,790
revenge?

1790
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:11,700
If we are like you in the rest, we will

1791
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,520
resemble you in that.

1792
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,950
If a Jew wrong a Christian,

1793
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:17,950
what is his humility?

1794
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,950
Revenge.

1795
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:19,950
If a Christian

1796
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:25,131
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be
by

1797
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:26,800
Christian example?

1798
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,469
Why, revenge.

1799
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:30,590
The villany you

1800
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:36,150
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go
hard but I

1801
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:38,530
will better the instruction.

1802
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,239
Enter a Servant

1803
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,239
Servant

1804
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:44,330
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house
and

1805
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,590
desires to speak with you both.

1806
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:47,590
SALARINO

1807
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,150
We have been up and down to seek him.

1808
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,159
Enter TUBAL

1809
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:52,159
SALANIO

1810
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,870
Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot
be

1811
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,480
matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.

1812
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,200
Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant

1813
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,200
SHYLOCK

1814
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,670
How now, Tubal!

1815
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,670
what news from Genoa?

1816
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:04,670
hast thou

1817
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,670
found my daughter?

1818
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,670
TUBAL

1819
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,800
I often came where I did hear of her, but
cannot find her.

1820
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
SHYLOCK

1821
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,810
Why, there, there, there, there!

1822
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:15,949
a diamond gone,

1823
01:16:15,949 --> 01:16:17,960
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort!

1824
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,960
The curse

1825
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,141
never fell upon our nation till now; I never
felt it

1826
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:28,080
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and
other

1827
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,260
precious, precious jewels.

1828
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,260
I would my daughter

1829
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,640
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her
ear!

1830
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,300
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the
ducats in

1831
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,300
her coffin!

1832
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,300
No news of them?

1833
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,511
Why, so: and I know

1834
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:47,159
not what's spent in the search: why, thou
loss upon

1835
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:48,159
loss!

1836
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:51,190
the thief gone with so much, and so much to

1837
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:55,380
find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:

1838
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:58,500
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on
my

1839
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:03,760
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no
tears

1840
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,170
but of my shedding.

1841
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,239
TUBAL

1842
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:11,300
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio,
as I

1843
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,640
heard in Genoa,--

1844
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,640
SHYLOCK

1845
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,719
What, what, what?

1846
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,800
ill luck, ill luck?

1847
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
TUBAL

1848
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,989
Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.

1849
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:21,989
SHYLOCK

1850
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:24,060
I thank God, I thank God.

1851
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,370
Is't true, is't true?

1852
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,370
TUBAL

1853
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,050
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped
the wreck.

1854
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,050
SHYLOCK

1855
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,320
I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good
news!

1856
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,610
ha, ha! where?

1857
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:35,610
in Genoa?

1858
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:36,610
TUBAL

1859
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,090
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard,
in one

1860
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:41,199
night fourscore ducats.

1861
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,199
SHYLOCK

1862
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:46,360
Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never
see my

1863
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,780
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!

1864
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,040
fourscore ducats!

1865
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,040
TUBAL

1866
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,360
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in
my

1867
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,400
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose
but break.

1868
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
SHYLOCK

1869
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,960
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll
torture

1870
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,790
him: I am glad of it.

1871
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,790
TUBAL

1872
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,920
One of them showed me a ring that he had of
your

1873
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,930
daughter for a monkey.

1874
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,930
SHYLOCK

1875
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:11,930
Out upon her!

1876
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,260
Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my

1877
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,930
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:

1878
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,940
I would not have given it for a wilderness
of monkeys.

1879
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,940
TUBAL

1880
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,260
But Antonio is certainly undone.

1881
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,260
SHYLOCK

1882
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,880
Nay, that's true, that's very true.

1883
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,640
Go, Tubal, fee

1884
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,510
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before.

1885
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,510
I

1886
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,870
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit;
for, were

1887
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:39,410
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise
I

1888
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,410
will.

1889
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,400
Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;

1890
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,920
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.

1891
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,920
Exeunt

1892
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,920
Scene 2

1893
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,920
Belmont.

1894
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,920
A room in PORTIA'S house.

1895
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,920
Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA,
and Attendants

1896
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,920
PORTIA

1897
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,240
I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two

1898
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,490
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,

1899
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,600
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.

1900
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,020
There's something tells me, but it is not
love,

1901
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,360
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,

1902
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,820
Hate counsels not in such a quality.

1903
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,260
But lest you should not understand me well,--

1904
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:17,640
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--

1905
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,870
I would detain you here some month or two

1906
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:21,790
Before you venture for me.

1907
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:22,980
I could teach you

1908
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:27,590
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;

1909
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:31,219
So will I never be: so may you miss me;

1910
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:35,460
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,

1911
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,560
That I had been forsworn.

1912
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,570
Beshrew your eyes,

1913
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:42,199
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;

1914
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,270
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,

1915
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:51,090
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,

1916
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,400
And so all yours.

1917
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,929
O, these naughty times

1918
01:19:54,929 --> 01:19:58,210
Put bars between the owners and their rights!

1919
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,889
And so, though yours, not yours.

1920
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:02,889
Prove it so,

1921
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:04,650
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.

1922
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:08,630
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,

1923
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:11,520
To eke it and to draw it out in length,

1924
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,310
To stay you from election.

1925
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,310
BASSANIO

1926
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,330
Let me choose

1927
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:18,010
For as I am, I live upon the rack.

1928
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,010
PORTIA

1929
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:20,710
Upon the rack, Bassanio!

1930
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,710
then confess

1931
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:23,740
What treason there is mingled with your love.

1932
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,740
BASSANIO

1933
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,420
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,

1934
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,199
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:

1935
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:33,300
There may as well be amity and life

1936
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,420
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

1937
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,420
PORTIA

1938
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,210
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,

1939
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:43,389
Where men enforced do speak anything.

1940
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:44,389
BASSANIO

1941
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,639
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

1942
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:47,639
PORTIA

1943
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,570
Well then, confess and live.

1944
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:50,570
BASSANIO

1945
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,370
'Confess' and 'love'

1946
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:55,930
Had been the very sum of my confession:

1947
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:59,139
O happy torment, when my torturer

1948
01:20:59,139 --> 01:21:02,949
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!

1949
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:06,199
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

1950
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:07,199
PORTIA

1951
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,200
Away, then!

1952
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,770
I am lock'd in one of them:

1953
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:13,290
If you do love me, you will find me out.

1954
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,239
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.

1955
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:18,170
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;

1956
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:22,200
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,

1957
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,470
Fading in music: that the comparison

1958
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:28,310
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the
stream

1959
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,310
And watery death-bed for him.

1960
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,310
He may win;

1961
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,860
And what is music then?

1962
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:35,310
Then music is

1963
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,150
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow

1964
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,810
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is

1965
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:42,810
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day

1966
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,950
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's
ear,

1967
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,360
And summon him to marriage.

1968
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,360
Now he goes,

1969
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,370
With no less presence, but with much more
love,

1970
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,989
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem

1971
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:56,600
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy

1972
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,410
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice

1973
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:03,380
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,

1974
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,159
With bleared visages, come forth to view

1975
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,650
The issue of the exploit.

1976
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:09,470
Go, Hercules!

1977
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:15,600
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay

1978
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,960
I view the fight than thou that makest the
fray.

1979
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,929
Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets
to himself

1980
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:25,219
SONG.

1981
01:22:25,219 --> 01:22:27,199
Tell me where is fancy bred,

1982
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,360
Or in the heart, or in the head?

1983
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,440
How begot, how nourished?

1984
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,480
Reply, reply.

1985
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,810
It is engender'd in the eyes,

1986
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,120
With gazing fed; and fancy dies

1987
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,550
In the cradle where it lies.

1988
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:44,510
Let us all ring fancy's knell

1989
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:46,980
I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.

1990
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,980
ALL

1991
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,980
Ding, dong, bell.

1992
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:49,980
BASSANIO

1993
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:54,120
So may the outward shows be least themselves:

1994
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,270
The world is still deceived with ornament.

1995
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:02,200
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,

1996
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,050
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,

1997
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,560
Obscures the show of evil?

1998
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,170
In religion,

1999
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:13,130
What damned error, but some sober brow

2000
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:17,310
Will bless it and approve it with a text,

2001
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:20,870
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

2002
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:24,350
There is no vice so simple but assumes

2003
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:28,790
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:

2004
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:33,239
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as
false

2005
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:37,139
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins

2006
01:23:37,139 --> 01:23:40,520
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;

2007
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,580
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as
milk;

2008
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:49,690
And these assume but valour's excrement

2009
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,170
To render them redoubted!

2010
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,770
Look on beauty,

2011
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:58,930
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;

2012
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:02,320
Which therein works a miracle in nature,

2013
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,520
Making them lightest that wear most of it:

2014
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:10,190
So are those crisped snaky golden locks

2015
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:14,159
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,

2016
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,420
Upon supposed fairness, often known

2017
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:20,540
To be the dowry of a second head,

2018
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,770
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.

2019
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:28,130
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore

2020
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:31,630
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf

2021
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:34,870
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,

2022
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:41,520
The seeming truth which cunning times put
on

2023
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,270
To entrap the wisest.

2024
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:47,969
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,

2025
01:24:47,969 --> 01:24:52,360
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;

2026
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,389
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge

2027
01:24:56,389 --> 01:25:02,150
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre
lead,

2028
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:05,850
Which rather threatenest than dost promise
aught,

2029
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:11,199
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;

2030
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:15,530
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

2031
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,530
PORTIA

2032
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:19,250
[Aside] How all the other passions fleet to
air,

2033
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:22,909
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,

2034
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,940
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!

2035
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,340
O love,

2036
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,830
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,

2037
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:34,560
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.

2038
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,070
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,

2039
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,070
For fear I surfeit.

2040
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,070
BASSANIO

2041
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,070
What find I here?

2042
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:43,170
Opening the leaden casket

2043
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,679
Fair Portia's counterfeit!

2044
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:47,679
What demi-god

2045
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,420
Hath come so near creation?

2046
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,660
Move these eyes?

2047
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:57,810
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,

2048
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:00,550
Seem they in motion?

2049
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:03,300
Here are sever'd lips,

2050
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,350
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar

2051
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:10,570
Should sunder such sweet friends.

2052
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,060
Here in her hairs

2053
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:17,469
The painter plays the spider and hath woven

2054
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:22,240
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,

2055
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:28,160
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--

2056
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:33,800
How could he see to do them? having made one,

2057
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:38,239
Methinks it should have power to steal both
his

2058
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,410
And leave itself unfurnish'd.

2059
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:43,740
Yet look, how far

2060
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:48,010
The substance of my praise doth wrong this
shadow

2061
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:52,679
In underprizing it, so far this shadow

2062
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,310
Doth limp behind the substance.

2063
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:58,370
Here's the scroll,

2064
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:01,969
The continent and summary of my fortune.

2065
01:27:01,969 --> 01:27:02,989
Reads

2066
01:27:02,989 --> 01:27:05,969
You that choose not by the view,

2067
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:11,410
Chance as fair and choose as true!

2068
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,969
Since this fortune falls to you,

2069
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:18,520
Be content and seek no new,

2070
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,580
If you be well pleased with this

2071
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:23,620
And hold your fortune for your bliss,

2072
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,659
Turn you where your lady is

2073
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:31,219
And claim her with a loving kiss.

2074
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,920
A gentle scroll.

2075
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,389
Fair lady, by your leave;

2076
01:27:38,389 --> 01:27:42,500
I come by note, to give and to receive.

2077
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,610
Like one of two contending in a prize,

2078
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:49,420
That thinks he hath done well in people's
eyes,

2079
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:53,199
Hearing applause and universal shout,

2080
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:57,080
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt

2081
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:01,360
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;

2082
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:06,700
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;

2083
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,770
As doubtful whether what I see be true,

2084
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:14,900
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.

2085
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,900
PORTIA

2086
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,950
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,

2087
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:22,050
Such as I am: though for myself alone

2088
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:23,989
I would not be ambitious in my wish,

2089
01:28:23,989 --> 01:28:27,750
To wish myself much better; yet, for you

2090
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,060
I would be trebled twenty times myself;

2091
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:35,170
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times
more rich;

2092
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:38,100
That only to stand high in your account,

2093
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:42,610
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,

2094
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:45,310
Exceed account; but the full sum of me

2095
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:50,190
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,

2096
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,440
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;

2097
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,000
Happy in this, she is not yet so old

2098
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,889
But she may learn; happier than this,

2099
01:28:59,889 --> 01:29:02,100
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;

2100
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,989
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit

2101
01:29:05,989 --> 01:29:10,000
Commits itself to yours to be directed,

2102
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,310
As from her lord, her governor, her king.

2103
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:15,590
Myself and what is mine to you and yours

2104
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:18,179
Is now converted: but now I was the lord

2105
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:21,300
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,

2106
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,429
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,

2107
01:29:25,429 --> 01:29:29,699
This house, these servants and this same myself

2108
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:33,219
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this
ring;

2109
01:29:33,219 --> 01:29:36,219
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,

2110
01:29:36,219 --> 01:29:38,570
Let it presage the ruin of your love

2111
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:41,420
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

2112
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:42,420
BASSANIO

2113
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:46,800
Madam, you have bereft me of all words,

2114
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,909
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;

2115
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:53,750
And there is such confusion in my powers,

2116
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:56,869
As after some oration fairly spoke

2117
01:29:56,869 --> 01:29:59,619
By a beloved prince, there doth appear

2118
01:29:59,619 --> 01:30:02,989
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;

2119
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:06,619
Where every something, being blent together,

2120
01:30:06,619 --> 01:30:11,390
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,

2121
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:13,659
Express'd and not express'd.

2122
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,179
But when this ring

2123
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:21,699
Parts from this finger, then parts life from
hence:

2124
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:26,070
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

2125
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,070
NERISSA

2126
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:30,440
My lord and lady, it is now our time,

2127
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:34,070
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,

2128
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:38,820
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

2129
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,820
GRATIANO

2130
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:41,860
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,

2131
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,810
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;

2132
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:47,130
For I am sure you can wish none from me:

2133
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:49,429
And when your honours mean to solemnize

2134
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:52,570
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,

2135
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:54,989
Even at that time I may be married too.

2136
01:30:54,989 --> 01:30:55,989
BASSANIO

2137
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:59,210
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

2138
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,210
GRATIANO

2139
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:03,260
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.

2140
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:06,010
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:

2141
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:08,550
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;

2142
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:12,130
You loved, I loved for intermission.

2143
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:15,239
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.

2144
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:17,770
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,

2145
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:20,020
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;

2146
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:22,670
For wooing here until I sweat again,

2147
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:25,119
And sweating until my very roof was dry

2148
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,740
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,

2149
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:31,060
I got a promise of this fair one here

2150
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:34,090
To have her love, provided that your fortune

2151
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,360
Achieved her mistress.

2152
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,360
PORTIA

2153
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,369
Is this true, Nerissa?

2154
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:38,369
NERISSA

2155
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:41,380
Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.

2156
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,380
BASSANIO

2157
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,400
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

2158
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,400
GRATIANO

2159
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,110
Yes, faith, my lord.

2160
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:49,110
BASSANIO

2161
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,820
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

2162
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:52,820
GRATIANO

2163
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,050
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand
ducats.

2164
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:56,050
NERISSA

2165
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,230
What, and stake down?

2166
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,230
GRATIANO

2167
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:01,889
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and
stake down.

2168
01:32:01,889 --> 01:32:03,739
But who comes here?

2169
01:32:03,739 --> 01:32:04,760
Lorenzo and his infidel?

2170
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,760
What,

2171
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,090
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?

2172
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,970
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger
from Venice

2173
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:13,970
BASSANIO

2174
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:16,239
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;

2175
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,820
If that the youth of my new interest here

2176
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,900
Have power to bid you welcome.

2177
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,130
By your leave,

2178
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:26,690
I bid my very friends and countrymen,

2179
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:27,690
Sweet Portia, welcome.

2180
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,690
PORTIA

2181
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,100
So do I, my lord:

2182
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,719
They are entirely welcome.

2183
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:32,719
LORENZO

2184
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:33,790
I thank your honour.

2185
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:35,810
For my part, my lord,

2186
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:38,739
My purpose was not to have seen you here;

2187
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:41,179
But meeting with Salerio by the way,

2188
01:32:41,179 --> 01:32:43,960
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,

2189
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,320
To come with him along.

2190
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,320
SALERIO

2191
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,350
I did, my lord;

2192
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:49,520
And I have reason for it.

2193
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,520
Signior Antonio

2194
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,550
Commends him to you.

2195
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:52,550
Gives Bassanio a letter

2196
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:53,550
BASSANIO

2197
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:54,550
Ere I ope his letter,

2198
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:56,210
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

2199
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:57,210
SALERIO

2200
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:59,940
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;

2201
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,409
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there

2202
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:03,909
Will show you his estate.

2203
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:04,909
GRATIANO

2204
01:33:04,909 --> 01:33:09,940
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.

2205
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:12,620
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?

2206
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:16,350
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?

2207
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:18,570
I know he will be glad of our success;

2208
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:21,540
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

2209
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,540
SALERIO

2210
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,870
I would you had won the fleece that he hath
lost.

2211
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:25,870
PORTIA

2212
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,840
There are some shrewd contents in yon same
paper,

2213
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:31,500
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:

2214
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,460
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the
world

2215
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,300
Could turn so much the constitution

2216
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,949
Of any constant man.

2217
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:40,989
What, worse and worse!

2218
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:43,060
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,

2219
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,350
And I must freely have the half of anything

2220
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:47,440
That this same paper brings you.

2221
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,440
BASSANIO

2222
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,980
O sweet Portia,

2223
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,540
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words

2224
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,540
That ever blotted paper!

2225
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:58,639
Gentle lady,

2226
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,500
When I did first impart my love to you,

2227
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,999
I freely told you, all the wealth I had

2228
01:34:04,999 --> 01:34:09,020
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;

2229
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:12,989
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,

2230
01:34:12,989 --> 01:34:15,830
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see

2231
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:19,000
How much I was a braggart.

2232
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
When I told you

2233
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,380
My state was nothing, I should then have told
you

2234
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:26,469
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,

2235
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:30,719
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,

2236
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,020
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,

2237
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,790
To feed my means.

2238
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:39,080
Here is a letter, lady;

2239
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,500
The paper as the body of my friend,

2240
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:45,190
And every word in it a gaping wound,

2241
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,239
Issuing life-blood.

2242
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:50,460
But is it true, Salerio?

2243
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,910
Have all his ventures fail'd?

2244
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:56,100
What, not one hit?

2245
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,489
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,

2246
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:02,400
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?

2247
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,219
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch

2248
01:35:06,219 --> 01:35:08,360
Of merchant-marring rocks?

2249
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,360
SALERIO

2250
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,950
Not one, my lord.

2251
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:13,869
Besides, it should appear, that if he had

2252
01:35:13,869 --> 01:35:16,969
The present money to discharge the Jew,

2253
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:18,480
He would not take it.

2254
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,561
Never did I know

2255
01:35:19,561 --> 01:35:22,429
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,

2256
01:35:22,429 --> 01:35:25,889
So keen and greedy to confound a man:

2257
01:35:25,889 --> 01:35:28,190
He plies the duke at morning and at night,

2258
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,740
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,

2259
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:34,389
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,

2260
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:36,750
The duke himself, and the magnificoes

2261
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:40,179
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with
him;

2262
01:35:40,179 --> 01:35:42,949
But none can drive him from the envious plea

2263
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:46,770
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.

2264
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:47,770
JESSICA

2265
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:50,080
When I was with him I have heard him swear

2266
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,870
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,

2267
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,889
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh

2268
01:35:55,889 --> 01:35:58,560
Than twenty times the value of the sum

2269
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,270
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,

2270
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:04,740
If law, authority and power deny not,

2271
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,300
It will go hard with poor Antonio.

2272
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,300
PORTIA

2273
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,600
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

2274
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,600
BASSANIO

2275
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,139
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,

2276
01:36:14,139 --> 01:36:17,369
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit

2277
01:36:17,369 --> 01:36:21,040
In doing courtesies, and one in whom

2278
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,830
The ancient Roman honour more appears

2279
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:26,320
Than any that draws breath in Italy.

2280
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,320
PORTIA

2281
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,830
What sum owes he the Jew?

2282
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:29,830
BASSANIO

2283
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:31,560
For me three thousand ducats.

2284
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,560
PORTIA

2285
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,560
What, no more?

2286
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,270
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;

2287
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:39,270
Double six thousand, and then treble that,

2288
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,930
Before a friend of this description

2289
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,160
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

2290
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,989
First go with me to church and call me wife,

2291
01:36:45,989 --> 01:36:48,400
And then away to Venice to your friend;

2292
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,139
For never shall you lie by Portia's side

2293
01:36:50,139 --> 01:36:51,889
With an unquiet soul.

2294
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:52,889
You shall have gold

2295
01:36:52,889 --> 01:36:55,320
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:

2296
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,230
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.

2297
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:00,369
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime

2298
01:37:00,369 --> 01:37:02,179
Will live as maids and widows.

2299
01:37:02,179 --> 01:37:03,230
Come, away!

2300
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:05,440
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:

2301
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,030
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:

2302
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:12,130
Since you are dear bought, I will love you
dear.

2303
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:14,030
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

2304
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:15,030
BASSANIO

2305
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:16,660
[Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all

2306
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:21,111
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate
is

2307
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:26,590
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and
since

2308
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:31,060
in paying it, it is impossible I should live,
all

2309
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:35,040
debts are cleared between you and I, if I
might but

2310
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,740
see you at my death.

2311
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,719
Notwithstanding, use your

2312
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:43,610
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you
to come,

2313
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:44,949
let not my letter.

2314
01:37:44,949 --> 01:37:45,949
PORTIA

2315
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:48,730
O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

2316
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,730
BASSANIO

2317
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:51,630
Since I have your good leave to go away,

2318
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:55,260
I will make haste: but, till I come again,

2319
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,949
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,

2320
01:37:57,949 --> 01:38:00,810
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

2321
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:01,810
Exeunt

2322
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:02,810
Scene 3

2323
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:03,810
Venice.

2324
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:04,810
A street.

2325
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:05,810
Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler

2326
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:06,810
SHYLOCK

2327
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:10,949
Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;

2328
01:38:10,949 --> 01:38:15,070
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:

2329
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:17,050
Gaoler, look to him.

2330
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:18,050
ANTONIO

2331
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,110
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

2332
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:20,110
SHYLOCK

2333
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:23,750
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:

2334
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,880
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.

2335
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,510
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;

2336
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:32,659
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:

2337
01:38:32,659 --> 01:38:35,540
The duke shall grant me justice.

2338
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,540
I do wonder,

2339
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,159
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond

2340
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:41,530
To come abroad with him at his request.

2341
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:42,530
ANTONIO

2342
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,969
I pray thee, hear me speak.

2343
01:38:43,969 --> 01:38:44,969
SHYLOCK

2344
01:38:44,969 --> 01:38:49,000
I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:

2345
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,470
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no
more.

2346
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:56,330
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,

2347
01:38:56,330 --> 01:39:01,270
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield

2348
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,980
To Christian intercessors.

2349
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,130
Follow not;

2350
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:10,890
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.

2351
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:11,890
Exit

2352
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:12,890
SALARINO

2353
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:14,260
It is the most impenetrable cur

2354
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,540
That ever kept with men.

2355
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:16,540
ANTONIO

2356
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:17,540
Let him alone:

2357
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:20,159
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.

2358
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:23,429
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:

2359
01:39:23,429 --> 01:39:25,540
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures

2360
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:28,010
Many that have at times made moan to me;

2361
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,610
Therefore he hates me.

2362
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:30,610
SALARINO

2363
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:31,610
I am sure the duke

2364
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,550
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

2365
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,550
ANTONIO

2366
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,580
The duke cannot deny the course of law:

2367
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,300
For the commodity that strangers have

2368
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:41,120
With us in Venice, if it be denied,

2369
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,511
Will much impeach the justice of his state;

2370
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:46,429
Since that the trade and profit of the city

2371
01:39:46,429 --> 01:39:48,489
Consisteth of all nations.

2372
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:50,239
Therefore, go:

2373
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:53,510
These griefs and losses have so bated me,

2374
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:55,730
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh

2375
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:58,120
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.

2376
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,340
Well, gaoler, on.

2377
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:02,260
Pray God, Bassanio come

2378
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:04,770
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

2379
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,770
Exeunt

2380
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:06,770
Scene 4

2381
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,770
Belmont.

2382
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:08,770
A room in PORTIA'S house.

2383
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,900
Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and
BALTHASAR

2384
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,900
LORENZO

2385
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:15,739
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,

2386
01:40:15,739 --> 01:40:19,949
You have a noble and a true conceit

2387
01:40:19,949 --> 01:40:24,969
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly

2388
01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:28,150
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.

2389
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:32,200
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,

2390
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,100
How true a gentleman you send relief,

2391
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,280
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,

2392
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,260
I know you would be prouder of the work

2393
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,420
Than customary bounty can enforce you.

2394
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:47,420
PORTIA

2395
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:48,850
I never did repent for doing good,

2396
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,880
Nor shall not now: for in companions

2397
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,880
That do converse and waste the time together,

2398
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,890
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,

2399
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,540
There must be needs a like proportion

2400
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,560
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;

2401
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,909
Which makes me think that this Antonio,

2402
01:41:03,909 --> 01:41:06,260
Being the bosom lover of my lord,

2403
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,920
Must needs be like my lord.

2404
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,470
If it be so,

2405
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,230
How little is the cost I have bestow'd

2406
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,290
In purchasing the semblance of my soul

2407
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,800
From out the state of hellish misery!

2408
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,270
This comes too near the praising of myself;

2409
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:21,820
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.

2410
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:24,330
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands

2411
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:26,820
The husbandry and manage of my house

2412
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:30,310
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,

2413
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:32,460
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow

2414
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,179
To live in prayer and contemplation,

2415
01:41:35,179 --> 01:41:36,460
Only attended by Nerissa here,

2416
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:39,130
Until her husband and my lord's return:

2417
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,530
There is a monastery two miles off;

2418
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,630
And there will we abide.

2419
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,630
I do desire you

2420
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:45,969
Not to deny this imposition;

2421
01:41:45,969 --> 01:41:48,889
The which my love and some necessity

2422
01:41:48,889 --> 01:41:50,369
Now lays upon you.

2423
01:41:50,369 --> 01:41:51,369
LORENZO

2424
01:41:51,369 --> 01:41:53,790
Madam, with all my heart;

2425
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:56,810
I shall obey you in all fair commands.

2426
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:57,810
PORTIA

2427
01:41:57,810 --> 01:42:00,330
My people do already know my mind,

2428
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:02,420
And will acknowledge you and Jessica

2429
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,480
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.

2430
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:07,110
And so farewell, till we shall meet again.

2431
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,110
LORENZO

2432
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,849
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

2433
01:42:10,849 --> 01:42:11,849
JESSICA

2434
01:42:11,849 --> 01:42:13,730
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

2435
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:14,730
PORTIA

2436
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:16,750
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased

2437
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:19,391
To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.

2438
01:42:19,391 --> 01:42:20,969
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO

2439
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:22,550
Now, Balthasar,

2440
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,800
As I have ever found thee honest-true,

2441
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,000
So let me find thee still.

2442
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,550
Take this same letter,

2443
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:30,880
And use thou all the endeavour of a man

2444
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,130
In speed to Padua: see thou render this

2445
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:36,760
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;

2446
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,010
And, look, what notes and garments he doth
give thee,

2447
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,830
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed

2448
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:45,070
Unto the tranect, to the common ferry

2449
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:46,199
Which trades to Venice.

2450
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:47,739
Waste no time in words,

2451
01:42:47,739 --> 01:42:50,409
But get thee gone: I shall be there before
thee.

2452
01:42:50,409 --> 01:42:51,409
BALTHASAR

2453
01:42:51,409 --> 01:42:53,270
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.

2454
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:54,270
Exit

2455
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:55,270
PORTIA

2456
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,270
Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand

2457
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:58,349
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands

2458
01:42:58,349 --> 01:42:59,870
Before they think of us.

2459
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:00,870
NERISSA

2460
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:01,870
Shall they see us?

2461
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:02,870
PORTIA

2462
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:04,700
They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,

2463
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,219
That they shall think we are accomplished

2464
01:43:06,219 --> 01:43:07,469
With that we lack.

2465
01:43:07,469 --> 01:43:08,929
I'll hold thee any wager,

2466
01:43:08,929 --> 01:43:11,969
When we are both accoutred like young men,

2467
01:43:11,969 --> 01:43:14,400
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,

2468
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,550
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,

2469
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:18,360
And speak between the change of man and boy

2470
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,530
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps

2471
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:24,119
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays

2472
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:27,989
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint
lies,

2473
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:30,340
How honourable ladies sought my love,

2474
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:32,761
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;

2475
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:36,270
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,

2476
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:38,920
And wish for all that, that I had not killed
them;

2477
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:42,480
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,

2478
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,980
That men shall swear I have discontinued school

2479
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,580
Above a twelvemonth.

2480
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,080
I have within my mind

2481
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:51,250
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,

2482
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:52,470
Which I will practise.

2483
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,470
NERISSA

2484
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:55,400
Why, shall we turn to men?

2485
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400
PORTIA

2486
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,400
Fie, what a question's that,

2487
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,739
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!

2488
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:02,369
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device

2489
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:04,840
When I am in my coach, which stays for us

2490
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,310
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,

2491
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,290
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.

2492
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,290
Exeunt

2493
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:11,290
Scene 5

2494
01:44:11,290 --> 01:44:12,290
The same.

2495
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:13,290
A garden.

2496
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:14,290
Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA

2497
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:15,290
LAUNCELOT

2498
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:17,500
Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the
father

2499
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:21,500
are to be laid upon the children: therefore,
I

2500
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:22,500
promise ye, I fear you.

2501
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,500
I was always plain with

2502
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:27,670
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the

Truly then I fear you are damned both by father

01:51:58,619 --> 01:52:02,340
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive

2680
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:05,849
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:

2681
01:52:05,849 --> 01:52:10,610
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?

2682
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:13,130
What if my house be troubled with a rat

2683
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:16,179
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats

2684
01:52:16,179 --> 01:52:17,920
To have it baned?

2685
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,869
What, are you answer'd yet?

2686
01:52:20,869 --> 01:52:23,200
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;

2687
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:27,090
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;

2688
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:30,480
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the
nose,

2689
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,409
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,

2690
01:52:32,409 --> 01:52:36,270
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood

2691
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:38,830
Of what it likes or loathes.

2692
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,710
Now, for your answer:

2693
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:44,560
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,

2694
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,160
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;

2695
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:51,679
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;

2696
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:54,969
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force

2697
01:52:54,969 --> 01:52:57,820
Must yield to such inevitable shame

2698
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:00,310
As to offend, himself being offended;

2699
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:04,619
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,

2700
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:07,179
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing

2701
01:53:07,179 --> 01:53:09,469
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus

2702
01:53:09,469 --> 01:53:11,989
A losing suit against him.

2703
01:53:11,989 --> 01:53:13,829
Are you answer'd?

2704
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:14,869
BASSANIO

2705
01:53:14,869 --> 01:53:17,929
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,

2706
01:53:17,929 --> 01:53:20,619
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

2707
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:21,619
SHYLOCK

2708
01:53:21,619 --> 01:53:24,929
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

2709
01:53:24,929 --> 01:53:25,929
BASSANIO

2710
01:53:25,929 --> 01:53:29,090
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

2711
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:30,119
SHYLOCK

2712
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:33,159
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

2713
01:53:33,159 --> 01:53:34,159
BASSANIO

2714
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:36,869
Every offence is not a hate at first.

2715
01:53:36,869 --> 01:53:37,869
SHYLOCK

2716
01:53:37,869 --> 01:53:40,430
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee
twice?

2717
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:41,430
ANTONIO

2718
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:43,969
I pray you, think you question with the Jew:

2719
01:53:43,969 --> 01:53:46,150
You may as well go stand upon the beach

2720
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,790
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;

2721
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:52,159
You may as well use question with the wolf

2722
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,929
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;

2723
01:53:54,929 --> 01:53:57,540
You may as well forbid the mountain pines

2724
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:00,620
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,

2725
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,579
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;

2726
01:54:03,579 --> 01:54:05,889
You may as well do anything most hard,

2727
01:54:05,889 --> 01:54:08,829
As seek to soften that--than which what's
harder?--

2728
01:54:08,829 --> 01:54:12,699
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech
you,

2729
01:54:12,699 --> 01:54:16,099
Make no more offers, use no farther means,

2730
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:18,500
But with all brief and plain conveniency

2731
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,780
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

2732
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,780
BASSANIO

2733
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,780
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

2734
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:26,780
SHYLOCK

2735
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:30,380
What judgment shall I dread, doing

2736
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:34,500
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,

2737
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,400
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

2738
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,400
DUKE

2739
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,520
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

2740
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,520
SHYLOCK

2741
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:45,770
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

2742
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:49,449
You have among you many a purchased slave,

2743
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:53,829
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

2744
01:54:53,829 --> 01:54:59,190
You use in abject and in slavish parts,

2745
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:03,290
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,

2746
01:55:03,290 --> 01:55:08,909
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?

2747
01:55:08,909 --> 01:55:11,699
Why sweat they under burthens?

2748
01:55:11,699 --> 01:55:12,699
let their beds

2749
01:55:12,699 --> 01:55:15,760
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates

2750
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,580
Be season'd with such viands?

2751
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:19,710
You will answer

2752
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:25,159
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:

2753
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:28,500
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,

2754
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:33,989
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have
it.

2755
01:55:33,989 --> 01:55:37,159
If you deny me, fie upon your law!

2756
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:39,810
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

2757
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:42,949
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have
it?

2758
01:55:42,949 --> 01:55:43,949
DUKE

2759
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:46,520
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,

2760
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,020
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,

2761
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,389
Whom I have sent for to determine this,

2762
01:55:51,389 --> 01:55:52,739
Come here to-day.

2763
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:53,739
SALERIO

2764
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:55,260
My lord, here stays without

2765
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:57,850
A messenger with letters from the doctor,

2766
01:55:57,850 --> 01:55:59,389
New come from Padua.

2767
01:55:59,389 --> 01:56:00,389
DUKE

2768
01:56:00,389 --> 01:56:02,760
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

2769
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:03,760
BASSANIO

2770
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,369
Good cheer, Antonio!

2771
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:07,870
What, man, courage yet!

2772
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:12,000
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones
and all,

2773
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,239
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

2774
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:16,239
ANTONIO

2775
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:17,880
I am a tainted wether of the flock,

2776
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,929
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit

2777
01:56:20,929 --> 01:56:23,829
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me

2778
01:56:23,829 --> 01:56:26,410
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,

2779
01:56:26,410 --> 01:56:28,790
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.

2780
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:32,301
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk

2781
01:56:32,301 --> 01:56:33,301
DUKE

2782
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:36,150
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

2783
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,150
NERISSA

2784
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,270
From both, my lord.

2785
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:40,139
Bellario greets your grace.

2786
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:41,139
Presenting a letter

2787
01:56:41,139 --> 01:56:42,139
BASSANIO

2788
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:44,349
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

2789
01:56:44,349 --> 01:56:45,349
SHYLOCK

2790
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:48,430
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

2791
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,430
GRATIANO

2792
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:52,230
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,

2793
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:55,560
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,

2794
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,560
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness

2795
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,750
Of thy sharp envy.

2796
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,579
Can no prayers pierce thee?

2797
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:03,579
SHYLOCK

2798
01:57:03,579 --> 01:57:05,969
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

2799
01:57:05,969 --> 01:57:06,969
GRATIANO

2800
01:57:06,969 --> 01:57:09,240
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!

2801
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,739
And for thy life let justice be accused.

2802
01:57:11,739 --> 01:57:14,380
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith

2803
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:16,540
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,

2804
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:18,670
That souls of animals infuse themselves

2805
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:21,909
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit

2806
01:57:21,909 --> 01:57:24,640
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,

2807
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,790
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,

2808
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:30,900
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd
dam,

2809
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:33,430
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires

2810
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:35,660
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.

2811
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,660
SHYLOCK

2812
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:39,949
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my
bond,

2813
01:57:39,949 --> 01:57:42,980
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:

2814
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:45,520
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall

2815
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,579
To cureless ruin.

2816
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:49,810
I stand here for law.

2817
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:50,810
DUKE

2818
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:52,889
This letter from Bellario doth commend

2819
01:57:52,889 --> 01:57:55,989
A young and learned doctor to our court.

2820
01:57:55,989 --> 01:57:56,989
Where is he?

2821
01:57:56,989 --> 01:57:57,989
NERISSA

2822
01:57:57,989 --> 01:57:59,440
He attendeth here hard by,

2823
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:02,190
To know your answer, whether you'll admit
him.

2824
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:03,190
DUKE

2825
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:04,520
With all my heart.

2826
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,829
Some three or four of you

2827
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:09,619
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.

2828
01:58:09,619 --> 01:58:12,290
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

2829
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:13,290
Clerk

2830
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,290
[Reads]

2831
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:15,880
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt
of

2832
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:19,520
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant
that

2833
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,949
your messenger came, in loving visitation
was with

2834
01:58:22,949 --> 01:58:26,920
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar.

2835
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,920
I

2836
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,540
acquainted him with the cause in controversy
between

2837
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:33,900
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned
o'er

2838
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:36,940
many books together: he is furnished with
my

2839
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:40,080
opinion; which, bettered with his own learning,
the

2840
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,341
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend,
comes

2841
01:58:43,341 --> 01:58:46,449
with him, at my importunity, to fill up your
grace's

2842
01:58:46,449 --> 01:58:48,699
request in my stead.

2843
01:58:48,699 --> 01:58:50,579
I beseech you, let his lack of

2844
01:58:50,579 --> 01:58:54,420
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend

2845
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,900
estimation; for I never knew so young a body
with so

2846
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,940
old a head.

2847
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:00,869
I leave him to your gracious

2848
01:59:00,869 --> 01:59:03,840
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish
his

2849
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,400
commendation.

2850
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,949
DUKE

2851
01:59:08,949 --> 01:59:12,290
You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:

2852
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:13,830
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

2853
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:14,830
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws

2854
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:16,639
Give me your hand.

2855
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:18,239
Come you from old Bellario?

2856
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,239
PORTIA

2857
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:20,239
I did, my lord.

2858
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:21,239
DUKE

2859
01:59:21,239 --> 01:59:22,660
You are welcome: take your place.

2860
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:24,849
Are you acquainted with the difference

2861
01:59:24,849 --> 01:59:27,579
That holds this present question in the court?

2862
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:28,579
PORTIA

2863
01:59:28,579 --> 01:59:30,050
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.

2864
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:33,159
Which is the merchant here, and which the
Jew?

2865
01:59:33,159 --> 01:59:34,159
DUKE

2866
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:36,240
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

2867
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,240
PORTIA

2868
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,240
Is your name Shylock?

2869
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,520
SHYLOCK

2870
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,080
Shylock is my name.

2871
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,080
PORTIA

2872
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,969
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;

2873
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:48,079
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law

2874
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:50,300
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.

2875
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,970
You stand within his danger, do you not?

2876
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:53,970
ANTONIO

2877
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,290
Ay, so he says.

2878
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:56,290
PORTIA

2879
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:57,690
Do you confess the bond?

2880
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:58,690
ANTONIO

2881
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,690
I do.

2882
01:59:59,690 --> 02:00:00,690
PORTIA

2883
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:01,690
Then must the Jew be merciful.

2884
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:02,690
SHYLOCK

2885
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:06,130
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

2886
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:07,130
PORTIA

2887
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:10,099
The quality of mercy is not strain'd,

2888
02:00:10,099 --> 02:00:12,120
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

2889
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:15,829
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;

2890
02:00:15,829 --> 02:00:19,590
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:

2891
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:21,869
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes

2892
02:00:21,869 --> 02:00:24,520
The throned monarch better than his crown;

2893
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:27,219
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,

2894
02:00:27,219 --> 02:00:29,860
The attribute to awe and majesty,

2895
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:33,760
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;

2896
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,360
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;

2897
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,190
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,

2898
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:40,950
It is an attribute to God himself;

2899
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:42,770
And earthly power doth then show likest God's

2900
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:45,099
When mercy seasons justice.

2901
02:00:45,099 --> 02:00:46,540
Therefore, Jew,

2902
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:50,320
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,

2903
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,960
That, in the course of justice, none of us

2904
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:57,050
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;

2905
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:59,000
And that same prayer doth teach us all to
render

2906
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,739
The deeds of mercy.

2907
02:01:00,739 --> 02:01:02,000
I have spoke thus much

2908
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,060
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;

2909
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:07,300
Which if thou follow, this strict court of
Venice

2910
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:10,170
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant
there.

2911
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:11,170
SHYLOCK

2912
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,840
My deeds upon my head!

2913
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:14,770
I crave the law,

2914
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:17,390
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

2915
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:18,390
PORTIA

2916
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:20,790
Is he not able to discharge the money?

2917
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:21,790
BASSANIO

2918
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:25,730
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;

2919
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:28,540
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,

2920
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:31,860
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,

2921
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:35,390
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:

2922
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:38,510
If this will not suffice, it must appear

2923
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:42,280
That malice bears down truth.

2924
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:43,690
And I beseech you,

2925
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:46,110
Wrest once the law to your authority:

2926
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:49,969
To do a great right, do a little wrong,

2927
02:01:49,969 --> 02:01:53,020
And curb this cruel devil of his will.

2928
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:54,020
PORTIA

2929
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:56,820
It must not be; there is no power in Venice

2930
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:58,120
Can alter a decree established:

2931
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:00,880
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,

2932
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,340
And many an error by the same example

2933
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:06,420
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

2934
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:07,420
SHYLOCK

2935
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,010
A Daniel come to judgment!

2936
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:10,329
yea, a Daniel!

2937
02:02:10,329 --> 02:02:13,230
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!

2938
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:14,230
PORTIA

2939
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:15,710
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

2940
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:16,710
SHYLOCK

2941
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:19,340
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

PORTIA

2943
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,860
Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd
thee.

SHYLOCK

2945
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:27,800
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:

2946
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,080
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

2947
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,080
No, not for Venice.

2948
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,080
PORTIA

2949
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:35,020
Why, this bond is forfeit;

2950
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:36,829
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim

2951
02:02:36,829 --> 02:02:39,369
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off

2952
02:02:39,369 --> 02:02:40,980
Nearest the merchant's heart.

2953
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:41,980
Be merciful:

2954
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:45,429
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

2955
02:02:45,429 --> 02:02:46,429
SHYLOCK

2956
02:02:46,429 --> 02:02:48,460
When it is paid according to the tenor.

2957
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:51,600
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;

2958
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,770
You know the law, your exposition

2959
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:57,540
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the
law,

2960
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,699
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,

2961
02:02:59,699 --> 02:03:02,900
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear

2962
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:04,849
There is no power in the tongue of man

2963
02:03:04,849 --> 02:03:08,469
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

2964
02:03:08,469 --> 02:03:09,469
ANTONIO

2965
02:03:09,469 --> 02:03:11,020
Most heartily I do beseech the court

2966
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,300
To give the judgment.

2967

PORTIA

2968
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:14,850
Why then, thus it is:

2969
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:17,409
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

2970
02:03:17,409 --> 02:03:18,409
SHYLOCK

2971
02:03:18,409 --> 02:03:19,409
O noble judge!

PORTIA

2974
02:03:22,349 --> 02:03:24,130
For the intent and purpose of the law

2975
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:26,190
Hath full relation to the penalty,

2976
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:28,250
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

Ay, his breast:

2984
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:43,450
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?

2985
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:47,040
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,040
It is so.

Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!

3007

Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;

3008
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:29,329
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind

3009
02:04:29,329 --> 02:04:32,579
Than is her custom: it is still her use

3010
02:04:32,579 --> 02:04:35,680
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,

3011
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:38,309
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow

3012

An age of poverty; from which lingering penance

3013
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:44,989
Of such misery doth she cut me off.

3014
02:04:44,989 --> 02:04:46,570
Commend me to your honourable wife:

3015
02:04:46,570 --> 02:04:49,460
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;

3016
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:53,150
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;

Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,

But life itself, my wife, and all the world,

3027
02:05:22,559 --> 02:05:26,290
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:

3028

Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted

3215
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:16,120
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,

3216
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:19,599
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,

3217
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,489
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

And I, delivering you, am satisfied

3224
02:12:36,070 --> 02:12:38,639
And therein do account myself well paid:

3225
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:41,659
My mind was never yet more mercenary.

3226
02:12:41,659 --> 02:12:45,550
I pray you, know me when we meet again:

3227
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:48,199
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

BASSANIO

3229
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:52,090
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:

3230
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:55,520
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,

3231
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:59,969
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray
you,

3232
02:12:59,969 --> 02:13:03,440
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

3238
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:14,130
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from
you:

3239
02:13:14,130 --> 02:13:18,220
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;

3240
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:20,700
And you in love shall not deny me this.

BASSANIO

3242
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:27,489
This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!

3243
02:13:27,489 --> 02:13:30,730
I will not shame myself to give you this.

3245
02:13:31,730 --> 02:13:34,510

There's more depends on this than on the value.

3249
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:45,639
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,

3250
02:13:45,639 --> 02:13:48,580
And find it out by proclamation:

3251
02:13:48,580 --> 02:13:52,230

I see, sir, you are liberal in offers

02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:58,349
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks

3255
02:13:58,349 --> 02:14:00,440
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

BASSANIO

3257
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:05,050
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;

3258
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:07,800
And when she put it on, she made me vow

3259
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:12,159

it.

And know how well I have deserved the ring,

3264
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:21,690
She would not hold out enemy for ever,

3265
02:14:21,690 --> 02:14:23,030
For giving it to me.

3266
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:26,389

Let his deservings and my love withal

My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,

Within the house, your mistress is at hand;

There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st

Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;

Such harmony is in immortal souls;

The reason is, your spirits are attentive:

For do but note a wild and wanton herd,

Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing
loud,

Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze

By the sweet power of music: therefore the
poet

3449
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:43,090
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones

Since nought so stockish, hard and full of
rage,

Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;

02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:18,540
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,

3574
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:21,090
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,

3575
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:24,250
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,

3576
02:26:24,250 --> 02:26:26,840
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:

3577
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:29,180
I could not for my heart deny it him.

3578
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:30,180
PORTIA

3579
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:31,830
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,

3580
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:34,750
To part so slightly with your wife's first
gift:

3581
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:37,760
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger

3582
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:40,340
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.

3583
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:43,710
I gave my love a ring and made him swear

3584
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:46,710
Never to part with it; and here he stands;

3585
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:49,270
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave
it

3586
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:52,160
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth

3587
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:54,580
That the world masters.

3588
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:55,740
Now, in faith, Gratiano,

3589
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:58,310
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:

3590
02:26:58,310 --> 02:27:02,660
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

3591
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:03,660
BASSANIO

3592
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:07,450
[Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand
off

3593
02:27:07,450 --> 02:27:10,250
And swear I lost the ring defending it.

3594
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:11,250
GRATIANO

3595
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:12,520
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away

3596
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,680
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed

3597
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:17,461
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,

3598
02:27:17,461 --> 02:27:20,550
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd
mine;

3599
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:22,439
And neither man nor master would take aught

3600
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:23,689
But the two rings.

3601
02:27:23,689 --> 02:27:24,689
PORTIA

3602
02:27:24,689 --> 02:27:26,560
What ring gave you my lord?

3603
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,750
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

3604
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:29,750
BASSANIO

3605
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:32,069
If I could add a lie unto a fault,

3606
02:27:32,069 --> 02:27:36,340
I would deny it; but you see my finger

3607
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:40,130
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

3608
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:41,130
PORTIA

3609
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:44,120
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

3610
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:46,580
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed

3611
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:47,689
Until I see the ring.

3612
02:27:47,689 --> 02:27:48,689
NERISSA

3613
02:27:48,689 --> 02:27:49,689
Nor I in yours

3614
02:27:49,689 --> 02:27:51,620
Till I again see mine.

3615
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:52,620
BASSANIO

3616
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:53,950
Sweet Portia,

3617
02:27:53,950 --> 02:27:57,600
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,

3618
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:01,740
If you did know for whom I gave the ring

3619
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:04,649
And would conceive for what I gave the ring

3620
02:28:04,649 --> 02:28:08,660
And how unwillingly I left the ring,

3621
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:12,270
When nought would be accepted but the ring,

3622
02:28:12,270 --> 02:28:15,290
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

3623
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:16,340
PORTIA

3624
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:18,300
If you had known the virtue of the ring,

3625
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:20,979
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,

3626
02:28:20,979 --> 02:28:23,930
Or your own honour to contain the ring,

3627
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:26,431
You would not then have parted with the ring.

3628
02:28:26,431 --> 02:28:29,109
What man is there so much unreasonable,

3629
02:28:29,109 --> 02:28:31,481
If you had pleased to have defended it

3630
02:28:31,481 --> 02:28:34,800
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty

3631
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:38,470
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?

3632
02:28:38,470 --> 02:28:40,370
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:

3633
02:28:40,370 --> 02:28:44,189
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

3634
02:28:44,189 --> 02:28:45,189
BASSANIO

3635
02:28:45,189 --> 02:28:48,400
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,

3636
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:52,200
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,

3637
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,360
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of
me

3638
02:28:55,360 --> 02:29:00,060
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny
him

3639
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:03,279
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;

3640
02:29:03,279 --> 02:29:06,490
Even he that did uphold the very life

3641
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:09,230
Of my dear friend.

3642
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:11,260
What should I say, sweet lady?

3643
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:15,680
I was enforced to send it after him;

3644
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:19,160
I was beset with shame and courtesy;

3645
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:21,689
My honour would not let ingratitude

3646
02:29:21,689 --> 02:29:25,840
So much besmear it.

3647
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,760
Pardon me, good lady;

3648
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:31,450
For, by these blessed candles of the night,

3649
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:34,840
Had you been there, I think you would have
begg'd

3650
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:37,930
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

3651
02:29:37,930 --> 02:29:38,930
PORTIA

3652
02:29:38,930 --> 02:29:41,840
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:

3653
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:44,380
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,

3654
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:47,390
And that which you did swear to keep for me,

3655
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:49,720
I will become as liberal as you;

3656
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:52,530
I'll not deny him any thing I have,

3657
02:29:52,530 --> 02:29:56,170
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:

3658
02:29:56,170 --> 02:29:58,920
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:

3659
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:02,720
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:

3660
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:05,890
If you do not, if I be left alone,

3661
02:30:05,890 --> 02:30:08,420
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,

3662
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:10,740
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

3663
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:11,740
NERISSA

3664
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:16,050
And I his clerk; therefore be well advised

3665
02:30:16,050 --> 02:30:18,370
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

GRATIANO

3667
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:22,620
Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;

3668
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:25,990
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

3669
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,990
ANTONIO

3670
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:29,351
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

3671
02:30:29,351 --> 02:30:30,351
PORTIA

3672
02:30:30,351 --> 02:30:33,240
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

3673
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:34,240
BASSANIO

3674
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:38,020
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;

3675
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:41,270
And, in the hearing of these many friends,

3676
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:47,070
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,

3677
02:30:47,070 --> 02:30:48,620
Wherein I see myself--

3678
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:49,620
PORTIA

3679
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:50,840
Mark you but that!

3680
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:53,000
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;

3681
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,940
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,

3682
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:58,910
And there's an oath of credit.

3683
02:30:58,910 --> 02:30:59,910
BASSANIO

3684
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:01,580
Nay, but hear me:

3685
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:05,939
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear

3686
02:31:05,939 --> 02:31:09,510
I never more will break an oath with thee.

3687
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:10,510
ANTONIO

3688
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:12,590
I once did lend my body for his wealth;

3689
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:16,010
Which, but for him that had your husband's
ring,

3690
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:19,170
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,

3691
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:21,760
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord

3692
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,790
Will never more break faith advisedly.

PORTIA

3694
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:26,060
Then you shall be his surety.

3695
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:28,420
Give him this

3696
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:31,050
And bid him keep it better than the other.

3698
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:34,040

PORTIA

3702
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:42,700
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;

3703

For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,

3707
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:55,479
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

GRATIANO

3709
02:31:56,479 --> 02:31:58,210
Why, this is like the mending of highways

In summer, where the ways are fair enough:

3711
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,590
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved
it?

You are all amazed:

3715
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:12,729
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;

3716
02:32:12,729 --> 02:32:14,729
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:

3717
02:32:14,729 --> 02:32:18,930
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,

3718
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:21,510
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here

3719
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:24,580
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you

3720

And even but now return'd; I have not yet

3721
02:32:27,229 --> 02:32:28,610
Enter'd my house.

02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:31,060
Antonio, you are welcome;

And I have better news in store for you

There you shall find three of your argosies

You shall not know by what strange accident

3728
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,180
I chanced on this letter.

Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.

3750
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:32,080
There do I give to you and Jessica,

3751
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:35,819
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,

3752
02:33:35,819 --> 02:33:39,840
After his death, of all he dies possess'd
of.

3753
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:40,840
LORENZO

3754
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:44,410
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way

3755
02:33:44,410 --> 02:33:45,970
Of starved people.

3756
02:33:45,970 --> 02:33:46,970
PORTIA

3757
02:33:46,970 --> 02:33:48,090
It is almost morning,

3758
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:50,170
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied

3759
02:33:50,170 --> 02:33:52,200
Of these events at full.

3760
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,820
Let us go in;

3761
02:33:53,820 --> 02:33:56,260
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,

3762
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:58,110
And we will answer all things faithfully.

3763
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:59,110
GRATIANO

3764
02:33:59,110 --> 02:34:01,130
Let it be so: the first inter'gatory

3765
02:34:01,130 --> 02:34:03,840
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,

3766
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:06,220
Whether till the next night she had rather
stay,

3767
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:09,051
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:

3768
02:34:09,051 --> 02:34:12,150
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,

3769
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:15,570
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

3770
02:34:15,570 --> 02:34:18,640
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing

3771
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:27,720
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

3772
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:31,060
Exeunt
