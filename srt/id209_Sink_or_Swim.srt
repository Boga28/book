CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,600
On board the Parvina

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
Leaning on the rail at the stern of the 
cruise ship Parvina, sipping his champagne,  

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,280
Eddie Munro looked out across the water and into 
the darkness. There was a warm, gentle breeze,  

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,200
and the sea was calm except for the dizzy trail of 
water churned up by the ship's angry propellers.  

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,840
It was a beautiful evening and there was no 
one else on deck. Eddie liked it that way. 

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
He looked down at his watch, 
which showed 10.31 p.m.,  

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
and the ship was already 
half a mile from the harbour.  

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,800
He was amazed that such a huge cruise ship could 
move so fast - he was amazed it stayed afloat at  

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,280
all! He watched St Thomas island getting further 
and further away. He stared at the silhouette of  

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,560
the island, at its faint black shapes of hills 
rising up into the night sky. Eddie smiled to  

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,520
himself as he noticed he could no longer see 
where the lights ended and the stars began. 

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
He finished his champagne and, for good 
luck, threw the glass far out into the sea.  

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,640
He never heard it drop. He couldn't see much 
at all in the warm Caribbean darkness, but he  

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
noticed for the first time how high up he was. 
The sea was a long, long way down, he thought. 

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,480
At this point his wife, Lynn, came out looking 
for him, wearing her long black evening dress  

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,480
and the silk purple scarf she had bought on the 
excursion earlier in the day. Her hair was dark  

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,080
and short with plum-coloured highlights.
He turned to put his arm around her as she  

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,880
joined him. He noticed her perfume, 
a powerful and luxurious scent. 

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,040
"Hello," he said, turning round. "You smell 
nice. And you look lovely. Are you married?" 

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,800
"Yes, thank you. To a very wealthy 
man, so you have no chance,"  

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,840
she said, smiling.
"Ah. But so am I." 

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,480
"Ah, so you're married to a wealthy man, are you?"
"I mean I'm wealthy. Very rich, in fact." 

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,200
"Well aren't you the lucky one," Lynn said.
"Yes, so if you're lucky, I might buy you dinner,"  

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,080
said Eddie, turning back to 
look out to sea once more. 

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,680
"Well, lucky me. How can I refuse such charm?" 
She looked at him and took hold of his hand.  

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
She smiled and stared out into the night, too, 
to the island which was now even further away. 

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,720
"I thought I'd find you out here," she said. "How  

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,960
many glasses have you thrown 
into the sea this evening?" 

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,760
"Only two," he said.
"Eddie!" 

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,600
"It's good luck."
"No, it isn't. Not  

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,960
if you're a fish and you get hit by a glass."
"The fish might like it. It's probably quite  

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,760
boring being a fish. The sudden arrival of a 
champagne glass might brighten up your life." 

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,600
"Or end it," she said.
"It's fun," said Eddie. "You should try it." 

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,120
"I think I've had enough 
champagne," his wife said. 

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,320
"I love the way the glass disappears the minute 
it leaves my hand, and the sea eats it up. You  

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,640
can't see it falling and you can't hear it 
hit the water. But you know it's landed,  

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,480
dived in and sunk to the bottom. Imagine 
- a tiny glass holding a giant ocean." 

39
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,240
"You think too much," she said, moving away 
and pulling him with her. "Why don't you come  

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,240
back inside? They're serving coffee and 
I think there's going to be some jazz." 

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,600
"All right," he said. "Just a few more minutes." 

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,600
"We have two more weeks on this cruise, Eddie. 
You have plenty of time to take it all in." 

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
"It's incredible, though, isn't 
it? So beautiful. It's perfect." 

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Lynn laughed. "It's completely black. 
I can't see anything in the dark." 

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,240
"I know. But it's all out there. 
The blue sea, the white sand,  

46
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,840
the palm trees, the boats..."
"The champagne glasses..." 

47
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,920
"Very funny," said Eddie. Then he pointed to the 
horizon. "Look over there at the dots of light. Do  

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,360
you think they're lights on the island or stars?"
Lynn looked hard into the night and gave it some  

49
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,720
thought. "Erm... lights."
"But you're not sure." 

50
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,360
"I am sure. I'm always sure."
"Hmm," he said. "How is that?" 

51
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,040
"Because I'm always right," she said, smiling.
"Oh really?" 

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
"Of course. I was right about setting 
up your own business, wasn't I?" 

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,720
"Yes."
"And I was right about  

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,840
selling the business off this year for twenty 
million - only sixteen years after starting." 

55
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
"Possibly," he teased. He 
wouldn't give in so easily. 

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,400
"And I was right to let you take me on this 
cruise to relax and celebrate in style." 

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
"Oh, I see. How generous."
"Just think. You don't have to  

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,760
work ever again. You're a millionaire, 
Mr Edward Munro. How does that sound?" 

59
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,120
"Lucky me," he said proudly.
"Yes, lucky you. Lucky us. Now  

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
come inside before we lose all our money 
paying for missing champagne glasses." 

61
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Back inside, the dining room was full of people. 
It was hot, but the lighting made it welcoming  

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,320
and comfortable. In the time Eddie had been 
outside, a space had been cleared for dancing and  

63
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,800
a few couples were already on their feet. In the 
corner, four musicians, three men and one woman,  

64
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,560
were playing a song Eddie knew well, but he 
couldn't recall its name. The singer was wearing a  

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,800
navy blue cocktail dress, and the men were wearing 
tuxedos, black ties and formal dinner suits. 

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,280
Eddie noticed how young the woman looked. Too 
young to have known the tune when it first  

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,440
appeared, Eddie thought, but her voice was strong 
and clear. And she seemed to believe in the words,  

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,760
at least. How old was she? Twenty-five? 
Twenty-six? Imagine singing on a cruise  

69
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,120
ship in your twenties! What a life! 
The fun, the parties, the people.  

70
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,200
The places to go and things to see 
- before your life had even started. 

71
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,320
It seems so easy now, Eddie thought. His twenties 
had been very different. And his thirties.  

72
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,120
Eddie tried not to think about his own past. Now 
was all that mattered. The past was the past.  

73
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,200
'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,' 
Clive, his business partner, always said. 'No  

74
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,560
such thing as luck,' he once said, 'it's simply 
the moment when preparation meets opportunity.' 

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,840
By now, Eddie was sitting back at 
his table and next to his wife.  

76
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,760
She was watching the band and tapping the table. 
She smiled at the other passengers opposite her,  

77
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,560
who smiled back, relaxed and enjoying the moment.  

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Eddie looked at his watch. It was almost 11 p.m., 
but he wasn't tired. Quite the opposite. He felt  

79
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,520
relaxed and energized. He'd always been 
an evening person, never a morning person. 

80
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,360
He looked around at the giant lounge with 
its circular tables and well-dressed diners,  

81
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,960
and the perfect white tablecloths. The waiters 
and waitresses in their smart uniforms moved  

82
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,000
smoothly in and out of the room, and Eddie's 
eyes followed them as they carried plates  

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,280
and coffee and cakes and trays around the 
tables, along the aisles and past the bar. 

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,520
Eddie watched the barman throwing ice cubes 
and cocktail shakers in the air and juggling  

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,840
them as he made the drinks in acrobatic style. 
He was confident and polished, and also young.  

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Possibly the same age as the singer. 
Why was everyone so young these days?  

87
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,080
Where were all the cruise ship jobs when 
Eddie was trying to get started in life?  

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,320
Why hadn't he thought of working 
on a ship in the Caribbean? 

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,040
He found himself staring at the bar in the 
distance. He was no longer thinking of anything  

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,160
in particular. He was simply listening to the 
sounds of jazz and the noise of a few hundred  

91
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
people talking and laughing.
And that was when he saw him. 

92
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,160
That was the moment when he saw Dominic 
for the first time in many, many years.  

93
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,840
The man was sitting at the bar, leaning 
forward and smoking a large cigar.  

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,120
He was older now, clearly, and his hair was very 
grey, but Eddie had no doubt that it was him.  

95
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,880
He couldn't believe that awful 
man was here on the ship. 

96
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,280
And then everything was different.
Nothing was the same. All was spoiled. 

97
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,120
Just like before.
 
CHAPTER TWO

98
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Argument with Dominic

99
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,640
"You know your problem, Eddie?" said Dominic 
Stephens in his office. "You're too hands-on."  

100
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,560
He leaned back in his large, leather chair behind 
his glass desk. He seldom made eye contact. His  

101
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,480
shoulders looked tense and his neck was hidden.
"I don't understand," said Eddie. "How can that  

102
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,720
be a problem? The team really appreciates my style 
and the customers love it. It's what I do best.  

103
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,640
It's why I was brought here in the first place."
"Oh, really?" said Dominic, clearly unimpressed. 

104
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,600
"I know for a fact that Ann and Gary 
didn't want an executive to run things.  

105
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,240
They wanted someone with practical experience, 
and drive - and lots of it. They said dull and  

106
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,680
uninspiring executives and managers have 
come and gone and there's been no direction,  

107
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,520
no feeling for the business. No passion."
"And you have passion?" said Dominic. 

108
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,960
"Yes. Do you?"
"This isn't about me, Eddie. It's about you,  

109
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,360
and it takes more than passion to do 
this job. You need to be a leader." 

110
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,320
"I am a leader," replied Eddie. "I've done it 
for years. My track record speaks for itself." 

111
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,320
"Well, you can't do it all by yourself."
"I'm not trying to do it all by myself,  

112
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Dominic. I'm building a team. I'm training new 
people. Resources are limited. It takes time." 

113
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,600
"We don't have time, Eddie."
What did Dominic Stephens know  

114
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,760
about passion or time? wondered Eddie. The only 
passion he seemed to have was being in charge.  

115
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,080
And golf. He seemed to have a lot of time 
for that. He even kept his clubs in the  

116
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,480
corner of his office. And today was Thursday. 
On Thursdays he always left early to play golf  

117
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,920
and he didn't even try to hide it.
Eddie was so angry his mouth was dry.  

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,440
"I don't know why you have a problem with 
me, Dominic. There's nothing wrong with my  

119
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
performance. Quite the opposite in fact."
"Oh, really?" 

120
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,000
"Yes. When I joined Fenton's, they were only 
producing software for small businesses in the UK.  

121
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,080
They had some accounting packages 
and sales and marketing databases,  

122
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,840
but not much else. I was brought in to expand 
the business and build exports, and that is  

123
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,160
exactly what I have done. I brought in some very 
talented people to develop our products, and we  

124
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,840
now offer some unique and very powerful programs 
used by the biggest and best companies globally.  

125
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,240
When I proposed and won the Moscow account, 
you said it couldn't be done, and now we  

126
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,040
supply the entire Russian region."
"Erm, excuse me, Mr Passion. I  

127
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,160
won the Moscow contract for you," said 
Dominic, pointing firmly at his own chest. 

128
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,320
Eddie could not believe his ears. This was so 
unfair. Rage filled his whole mind and body.  

129
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,560
"You did not win that contract. You knew some of 
the people in the Russian state department there,  

130
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,560
that's all. I spent most of last year - and the 
year before - going to Russia and working long,  

131
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,280
long hours to build a business plan that would 
work. Don't take the credit away from me,  

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,480
Dominic. Without me, this company could 
never have won such a high-profile project." 

133
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,320
"Well, I still haven't seen the final numbers, 
and I still haven't seen the new business plan,"  

134
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Dominic said, throwing his arms around.
"Yes, you have. I've kept you informed  

135
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,640
the whole time with numerous emails."
"Oh, emails, emails! I don't have time  

136
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,080
for emails. I get about three hundred a day. 
How on earth can I keep up with all that?" 

137
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,240
Well, it would help if you didn't play so much 
golf, Eddie wanted to say. It would help if you  

138
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
let me do my job and didn't interfere. It 
would help if you weren't so aggressive.  

139
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,000
Instead, he tried to remain diplomatic and 
said, "Well, if you don't read my emails,  

140
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
how can we communicate?"
"Simple. Pick up the phone." 

141
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,680
He made it sound so easy. This was ridiculous. 
"I do call you, Dominic. You're never there.  

142
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,560
I leave messages but you don't call 
back. When we do get time to meet,  

143
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,320
I don't think you're really listening."
"I'm always listening to you, Eddie," said  

144
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,800
Dominic in a weary voice. "Because you talk so 
much, that's all you ever do. Talk, talk, talk." 

145
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,040
"You're making personal comments, and that is 
not professional. I talk because I'm passionate.  

146
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,320
And I deliver. If I say I'll do something, I 
do it, and within budget, and you know it." 

147
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
"You were not on budget. Last year 
you went over budget by 25,000 pounds" 

148
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,600
Not this again. Eddie was so tired of 
the same story. "I can account for every  

149
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,480
penny my department spent. No one seems to 
know what happened to that 25,000 pounds." 

150
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,840
Dominic looked at him accusingly.
"Don't look at me like that,"  

151
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,000
said Eddie.
"Like what?" 

152
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,080
"Look, the way I see it..." Eddie began, but again 
he was cut off in mid-sentence. Dominic always  

153
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:29,280
interrupted everyone. He was like a spoilt child.
And so the situation was impossible. Eddie  

154
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,680
simply wanted to leave. He could no 
longer focus. He could never win. 

155
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,040
Eddie came out of the office. His whole body was 
trembling, and he tried very hard not to slam the  

156
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,920
door, scream or break something. He realized he 
was too angry and too upset to go back to the team  

157
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,880
or finish his work. He decided to slip 
out of the office for ten minutes,  

158
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,520
just to calm down. He would have a coffee. 
Or call Lynn. Come on, Ed, he told himself.  

159
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Get things in perspective. It's only a job. 

160
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,920
He was almost at reception and the main door, when 
Clive passed him on the way to the photocopier.  

161
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,440
"Ed, what's wrong?" he asked, 
stopping in the corridor. 

162
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,520
Eddie couldn't speak. He was afraid to say 
anything, as he didn't know what might come out.  

163
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
His face was red and tears were 
stinging his eyes. He looked down,  

164
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,720
ignored Clive and walked out of the door into 
the street and towards the local cafe.
 
 

165
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
CHAPTER THREE

166
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
Someone from the past

167
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,640
"You all right, Eddie?" asked Lynn, who 
had noticed Eddie staring at the bar.  

168
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Eddie took a moment and then said, "Yes, fine. 
Why?" But he was still lost in thought. He wasn't  

169
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,520
sure if the ship was moving or if he was dizzy.
"You look so serious. Come on, let's dance." 

170
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,560
He was still staring at the bar. The man was still 
there. It was Dominic. Sitting at the bar barely  

171
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:12,000
fifty meters away, drinking and smoking. As simple 
as that. Was the world so small? thought Eddie.  

172
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,760
Couldn't it be a bit bigger? Why here? Why now? 
After all this time. Why on this ship? A familiar  

173
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,920
sickness in his stomach returned.
"Well, don't get too excited,  

174
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,600
will you?" Eddie heard his wife say.
"Sorry?" he said, turning his attention to Lynn. 

175
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,480
"A dance! Can we dance?" Lynn said impatiently.
"Yes, sure. Sorry." 

176
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,400
They both got up and walked to the dance 
floor. They held each other and danced  

177
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,720
slowly for the final verse of yet another 
song whose name Eddie couldn't remember. 

178
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,280
Turning in the dance, Eddie was pleased that 
Lynn was there with him as he tried to take in  

179
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,800
the fact that he was now staring at the distant 
shape of Dominic Stephens, on the far side of  

180
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,960
the ship's dining room. The man, Eddie saw, now 
turned to watch the dining room and the dancing.  

181
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,760
He was hidden in a fog of his own cigar smoke. How 
Eddie had hated him. And how, after all this time,  

182
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,560
he still hated him.
The memories. 

183
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,120
The anger.
The pain. 

184
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,640
"Are you sure you're feeling 
all right, Eddie?" asked Lynn  

185
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
when they got back to their cabin. Eddie 
was sitting on the bed staring into space. 

186
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,760
"Yes. Just tired. I think I'm still jet-lagged, 
and I'm tired after walking on the island today." 

187
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,920
"You sure?"
"Yes." 

188
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,560
"That trip on the glass-bottomed 
submarine was amazing, wasn't it?" 

189
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,040
"Yeah," said Eddie. But he 
still couldn't think straight.  

190
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,880
His mind was filling up more and more with the 
terrible realization that Dominic was on the ship. 

191
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,120
Lynn knew him too well. "Eddie," 
she said, sitting down beside him,  

192
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,080
taking his hand and looking at him. She 
stroked the back of his head. "What's wrong?" 

193
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,280
Eddie had decided to accept that the trip was 
now spoiled. Did he need to spoil it for his  

194
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,360
wife? She didn't have to know. They would have 
their luxury cruise and go home to a new life.  

195
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,360
The ship was big enough. Dominic and Eddie 
both looked older and Dominic probably wouldn't  

196
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,040
even remember him, so why worry about it?
But all the old feelings were there again,  

197
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,720
and Eddie could sense his energy 
slipping away just thinking about it.  

198
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,200
It showed on his face and Lynn could see it. 
Eddie could never hide much from his wife,  

199
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:47,680
and before he knew it he found himself weakening.
"It's Dominic. He's on the ship." It sounded so  

200
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,760
strange to Eddie to even say those words.
There was a pause. 

201
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,080
Lynn looked more closely at her husband.
"What?" said Lynn quietly. "Dominic Stephens?  

202
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,840
You're kidding."
"I'm not kidding, Lynn. I wish I was," said Eddie. 

203
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
"I haven't heard that name in a long time." 

204
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
"Well, he's here."
"How do you know he's here?" 

205
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,000
"I saw him. He was sitting at the bar this 
evening when we came in from the deck." 

206
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
"Eddie, we were sitting on the other side of 
the dining room - you could hardly see anything.  

207
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,840
How can you be sure it was him?"
"Oh, I'm sure, Lynn. No mistake.  

208
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,680
The same fat, lazy bloke. But less 
hair now. And grey. And fatter." 

209
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,000
Lynn was still trying to take it in. 
"Dominic Stephens is on this ship?" 

210
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,280
"Yes."
She waited a moment. "Oh, Eddie." 

211
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,320
They both sat there for a moment. Then Lynn 
spoke again. She was already recovering.  

212
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,080
"Well, look, it's a long time ago, Ed. It doesn't 
matter any more. He doesn't matter any more. He's  

213
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,160
nothing. You don't have to talk to him."
"I know." 

214
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,040
"It's a big ship," Lynn continued. "It's 
extremely unlikely you're going meet him..." 

215
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,680
"I saw him at the bar!" said Eddie.
"... and even if you met him by chance,  

216
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,600
as I said, he won't remember you." Then she 
looked closely at Eddie and asked softly,  

217
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,880
"You didn't speak to him, did you?"
"No," replied Eddie. "Of course not." 

218
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
"And did he see you?" 

219
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,640
"No." Eddie wasn't sure if Dominic 
had seen him or not. Probably not.  

220
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,320
"Well, that's OK then," Lynn said, but 
she knew it was an unhelpful thing to say. 

221
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,320
"It's not OK, Lynn. It's not 
OK at all. That man is back." 

222
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,520
"He's not back. Try to calm down."
"Calm down?!" said Eddie,  

223
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,760
raising his voice and standing up. "We lost 
everything because of him, Lynn, everything - he  

224
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,920
cheated and bullied and took it all away!"
"Yes, I know, Ed, but it was sixteen years ago.  

225
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,640
We've come a long way since then. You and Clive 
have each just put ten million quid in the bank!" 

226
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,480
"So what? Dominic got away 
with it all at Fenton's!" 

227
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,000
"It's all in the past. It doesn't matter anymore."
"It does matter. He's still getting away with it.  

228
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
He still looks very pleased with himself."
"You don't know that.  

229
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,320
You don't know his life now. I can't believe 
we're talking about all this after so long." 

230
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,640
"Because he's here, Lynn. 
On the ship. On our cruise!" 

231
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,120
"Eddie, listen to me. Calm down. He and Neal 
gave you a bad time, I know. But you fought back  

232
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,680
and survived, and you became successful anyway. 
Without him. In spite of him and the things he  

233
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,480
said and did. You're here with me now, on holiday, 
with financial security for the rest of our lives.  

234
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,280
You did it. You climbed back out of the hole 
and it's OK. He can't hurt you anymore." 

235
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,840
"He nearly destroyed us, Lynn."
"But he didn't, did he? We didn't let him." 

236
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:20,720
Eddie wiped the tears from his eyes. "I can't 
believe he's on board! Why? He's still out  

237
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,240
there getting in the way. Spoiling everything."
"He's not spoiling anything. Only if you let him.  

238
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,240
You've come a long way since he pushed you out."
"So why do I suddenly feel so angry? I can't  

239
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,640
believe it. I think of him and those 
days at Fenton's from time to time,  

240
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,800
sometimes a lot, and it never upsets me.
"Well, you went through a tough time.  

241
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,400
It was very hard. If you really did see him 
tonight, of course that's going to upset you.  

242
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,000
It's not the same as the occasional memory."
"Oh, I saw him all right. He still smokes those  

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
hideous cigars."
"OK," said Lynn. 

244
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
"You went through it too, 
you know," he reminded her. 

245
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,000
"I know."
Another pause. 

246
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,360
"We lost so much, Lynn: the house, the money. 
Us. I was off sick for a year. A year!" 

247
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,320
"I know," said Lynn. "There's no getting away 
from the damage the man caused. But you have  

248
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,720
to calm down. Nothing is going to happen. You 
don't have to see him again or talk to him." 

249
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,240
"Well, what if he takes the same excursion as us 
at some point? Or sits at our table for dinner?" 

250
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,360
"Eddie, there are almost 2,000 
people on board. It won't happen.  

251
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,160
We can ignore him. Being the sort of person 
Dominic is, he's probably treated lots of  

252
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,960
people the way he treated you, so he won't 
know who you are or remember what he did." 

253
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,520
"Somehow that makes it worse."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it. If  

254
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,120
we see him again or he even recognizes you, we'll 
cross that bridge when we come to it, all right?" 

255
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,880
Eddie was quiet.
"All right?"  

256
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,560
Lynn repeated, holding his face in her hands. 

257
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,200
"OK," said Eddie.
 
 
CHAPTER FOUR

258
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
After the argument

259
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Eddie sat in a cafe not far from the office, 
dipping his teaspoon into a large cappuccino,  

260
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,680
and tried to think of what he could do about 
his job. He could leave, but that would mean  

261
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,760
giving in and letting Dominic have exactly what 
he wanted. Besides, it would take several months,  

262
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,400
possibly a year, to find another good job, 
and he would still have to put up with him  

263
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,080
in the meantime. He could officially complain 
about Dominic's behavior. He had a strong case.  

264
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,720
But that would only make things worse. Somehow 
Dominic had Gary, the CEO, on his side.  

265
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,680
And Ann Blake, the Financial Director, 
would never support getting rid of Dominic,  

266
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:08,240
since she had hired him in the first place.
"He's unbelievable. He actually said I was  

267
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,400
too hands-on," said Eddie, stabbing 
at his drink with his spoon. 

268
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,160
"Really?" said Clive, who had left the 
office and found Eddie sitting in the cafe. 

269
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,520
"Yes. He also said I wasn't a leader 
and that Moscow was his deal." 

270
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,960
"You're joking," said Clive. 
He seemed genuinely surprised.  

271
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
"That deal was yours. Everyone knows that." 

272
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
"Then he said my communication 
wasn't good enough." 

273
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,480
"Eh? He can talk. He's got no people skills 
whatsoever. Anyway, he never reads his emails." 

274
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,880
"I know. I told him that. 
He says I should phone him,"  

275
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,080
and Eddie laughed in disgust.
"He's never there!" 

276
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,240
"Exactly! I said that too. It's pointless, Clive. 
He doesn't listen and he interrupts all the time.  

277
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
He's so smug. He thinks he's 
right about everything." 

278
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
"At least you're not alone. Everyone 
has the same problem with him." 

279
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
"Well, what is his problem?"
"It's obvious. He's insecure." 

280
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
"Well, it's not obvious when you're 
sitting in a meeting with him." 

281
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,120
"He's a bully in a shirt and tie. All bullies 
are insecure. Maybe his dad didn't show  

282
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,640
him any love. Maybe his dad's worse!"
Eddie tried to smile as he looked out  

283
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,320
of the window, as if the answer were out there 
somewhere. Maybe if he were to look long enough,  

284
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,880
the answer would come and find him. 
He doubted it. He was exhausted. 

285
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,040
"Clive, how do they get to be in charge, these 
people? They're utterly useless. He's useless." 

286
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,760
"Yes, and he knows it. Deep down. That's why 
he picks on people and moves responsibility.  

287
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,760
No one actually knows what he does."
"Yeah, and by the time they find out they  

288
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
have to pay him a year's salary, 
and then he gets another job." 

289
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
"That's his skill, though. He 
talks well to the top guys.  

290
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,840
But the real people don't respect him. I spoke 
to someone at Gallagher's the other week,  

291
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,040
where Dominic worked for about two 
years. They said the same thing." 

292
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,840
"Do you think he has any idea what 
people really think and say about him?" 

293
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:27,280
"No, I don't think he does. He's so superior in 
his own mind he probably thinks we're all losers." 

294
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,560
"But he knows I'm good. He knows you're good 
too, and that really irritates him, because we  

295
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,600
know this job and he doesn't. He just moves tasks 
and people around all day and calls it strategy." 

296
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:48,000
"I know," said Clive.
They both stared out of the window. 

297
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,520
"Did you hear what he said to Steve the 
other day?" asked Clive. "No, what?" 

298
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,160
"'Dominic told Steve that he 
got the top job because Ann  

299
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:06,320
and Gary saw him as a wise ambassador.'"
"Wise? Ambassador? Ambassador for what?" 

300
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,680
"Who knows? He's in his own dream world."
"Did he really say that?" 

301
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,600
"Yes. And when Steve questioned it, Dominic 
then said he was older than anyone else anyway." 

302
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,480
"Unbelievable."
"Who knows what he thinks?  

303
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,080
He's not like us. I think that scares him."
"Where do these people come from?" 

304
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,040
"I don't know, mate, but they soon move 
on. We just have to hold on. Look on  

305
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:42,560
the bright side - it couldn't get any worse."
But Eddie wasn't so sure. Eddie had the feeling  

306
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,320
that things were going to get a lot worse.
And he was right. 

307
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Back at home, Eddie spent the evening trying to 
catch up on the work he'd missed that afternoon,  

308
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,840
and looking at the many emails he 
had sent Dominic. It was a nightmare. 

309
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,000
Again and again he considered walking away 
from the job, but it hurt him more simply to  

310
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,920
give up. Besides, he was enjoying the Moscow 
project, and he had done so much work for it.  

311
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,920
When he was in Moscow, he 
could get on with things. He  

312
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,280
loved Russia and he loved the people there. 
It was such a different world from the UK;  

313
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:28,160
and the owners of Zariya, Dima and Tatiana, always 
made him feel so welcome. Over time Eddie had  

314
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,720
had to explain to them some of the difficulties 
back in London, and they had been very helpful.  

315
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,000
Eddie was reading one of Dima's emails and 
smiling again when Lynn walked into the room. 

316
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,840
"Will you be much longer?" asked Lynn.
"Maybe. I'm behind on some deadlines,  

317
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,440
and today's battle with Dominic didn't help."
"Just leave it now, Ed. Come to bed," said Lynn. 

318
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,680
"I can't. There's so much. Too much."
"There's always too much,"  

319
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,840
Lynn replied. "It will still be there 
in the morning. Give yourself a break." 

320
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,320
"Yeah, well, that's true, but with Dominic I have 
to be extra careful. He picks on everything." 

321
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,680
"He's an idiot."
"Yeah, I know it,  

322
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,440
and you know it, and everyone else 
knows it, but he's still the boss." 

323
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,640
"Well, what I mean is just ignore him."
"How can I ignore him, Lynn? He's the boss!  

324
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,760
He runs the division. He runs me."
"Well, don't let him," said Lynn. 

325
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,120
"I'm not letting him!" shouted Eddie. "I'm 
trying to stop him. That's the problem!" 

326
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,960
"There's no need to shout, Eddie. I'm not deaf."
"Well, you're not being very helpful." 

327
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,760
"Thanks a lot," she said 
sarcastically. "I'm doing my best." 

328
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,280
"Sorry. I was hired to build a team, win a project 
like the one in Moscow and make things profitable.  

329
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,280
He was brought in to oversee the whole division. 
Then he gets bonuses for doing very little,  

330
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,240
and I get the blame when the 
numbers suddenly don't add up." 

331
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,160
"Your numbers are fine."
"Not according to Dominic." 

332
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,680
"Why?"
"Oh, well, during our  

333
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:13,600
useless meeting today, he brought up that old 
story about being 25,000 pounds over budget,  

334
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,720
when everyone knows he fixed the numbers. 
Somehow he gets his bonuses and puts  

335
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,120
any blame on me. I'm almost certain 
now that he wants me out, Lynn." 

336
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:31,360
"Surely not. He needs you. If it weren't for you, 
good people would have left ages ago. Besides,  

337
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,120
who else could move Russia along?"
"Oh, don't mention Russia." 

338
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,680
"Why? That's your big success story."
"Oh, he keeps going on about the fact that  

339
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,960
he won the Moscow contract, not me."
"What? That's just not true." 

340
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,800
"I know."
"What about Ann and Gary?  

341
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,640
Can't you talk to them about all this?"
"They've changed, Lynn. I've hardly seen them  

342
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,000
since the new partners came in. Besides, Gary and 
Dominic are always playing golf at the weekends.  

343
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,920
Ann's OK still, but she's very political, 
and I think she's embarrassed that Dominic's  

344
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,000
upsetting everyone. After all, she 
was the one who recruited him." 

345
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,920
'And Human Resources? Can't 
you report him to them?" 

346
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,080
"What do I tell them? That he's 
got the people skills of a goat!" 

347
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,600
"Well, that's one thing. And the 
intimidation, the lies and the..."  

348
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,040
It's very hard to prove, Lynn. 
He's got his back covered,  

349
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,640
and they would only report the whole 
thing to Ann and Gary. And then what?" 

350
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,840
"Well, presumably they tell Dominic and 
you all get together and sort it out." 

351
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,160
"Easy, really. Why didn't I think of that?"
"You know what I mean, Eddie. There's no  

352
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,200
need to be sarcastic. I'm only trying to 
help. I hate it when you're like this." 

353
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,560
"Well, you're not living in the real world, 
are you, Lynn? You're a Primary school teacher,  

354
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,280
for goodness' sake. If things go wrong, you 
all get into a circle and sing a song about  

355
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,160
it. Or draw a picture. It's not that simple when 
you're in a multi-million pound business and..." 

356
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,080
But Lynn had heard enough.
She was already leaving the room.  

357
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,040
Eddie stared back at the open screen on 
his laptop at hundreds and hundreds of  

358
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,840
emails. He thought about how much more 
he had to do before he could go to bed,  

359
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,080
about the hurt he had caused Lynn and about the 
injustice of Dominic and of people like him. 

360
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,880
Eddie slammed down the laptop lid.
The job was broken, the evening was broken,  

361
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,000
and now his relationship was broken.
 
 
CHAPTER FIVE

362
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,800
Eddie's dream

363
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
Although the sea was calm, 
Eddie didn't sleep well.  

364
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,840
He had a dream that seemed to last all night.
It began with him lying in bed in the cabin of  

365
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,480
the ship, and waking up to find himself 
in his old bedroom from his childhood.  

366
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,840
But the bedroom was on the ship. He sat up in 
the top bunk of some familiar bunk beds. In the  

367
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,080
bottom bunk should have been his sister Ellen, 
but he knew his wife was the occupant now. The  

368
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,680
bottom bunk was empty, however, and he saw water 
coming in quietly but rapidly under the door. 

369
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,840
In his dream, he jumped out of his bunk 
and straight into half a meter of water.  

370
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,240
It was ice-cold and Eddie gasped in shock. He was 
wearing a grey suit and black shoes, but no socks,  

371
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,880
shirt or tie. With his feet already going numb 
in the cold water, he opened the small wardrobe  

372
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,760
to look for them and found a public telephone. 
Business cards were stuck all over the wall. He  

373
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,160
noticed his own from years ago with the familiar 
Fentons logo. But his details were in Russian. 

374
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,880
His stomach was tight.
His head ached. 

375
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,800
In his dreaming mind, a thousand tasks and 
deadlines seemed to weigh upon his shoulders. 

376
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:03,520
The phone started ringing. He picked it up.
"Where are you?" a voice shouted on the other end. 

377
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,080
It was Dominic.
"The unmistakable,  

378
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,760
cold, demanding tone of voice: 
"Do you know what time it is?" 

379
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Eddie lifted the sleeve of his suit to look at his 
watch, but its face was frosted over and unclear.  

380
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Water had got into it somehow. 
The hands were barely visible. 

381
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,000
"I can't tell," he heard himself say.
"You can't tell the time?  

382
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,920
Typical! What's the matter with you? 
We're all waiting for you. Come on." 

383
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,600
"Who's waiting for me? Where are you?"
Eddie heard laughter in the background. 

384
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
"On the bridge. Where do you 
think?" Then the line went dead. 

385
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,440
The water was up to Eddie's knees now, and rising 
fast. He decided to leave the socks, shirt and  

386
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,320
tie and make his way to the bridge - dressed 
or not dressed. How much worse could it be? 

387
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,840
As Eddie opened the door, water poured in at waist 
level, and with it thousands of champagne glasses.  

388
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,800
Most of them were intact, but many 
were broken. Too many for Eddie to  

389
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,240
avoid. His chest and legs were cut many 
times as he waded out into the corridor. 

390
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,200
He saw Clive at the far end.
"Clive!" he shouted. "Clive, it's me! Over here!" 

391
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,080
But Clive didn't hear him. He, too, was struggling 
with the strong current of water dragging him down  

392
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,840
and away at the far end of the corridor.
"CLIVE!" shouted Eddie in his sleep. 

393
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,680
Opposite Eddie in the dream was a metal ladder 
which went up to the next level of the ship  

394
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,320
through a small hole. It was big enough for him 
to get through. This ladder led to another ladder  

395
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,320
and another hole. And another. And another. 
Ladders stretched all the way in a giant tunnel  

396
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,080
leading upwards. Eddie climbed and climbed. 
He could hear the laughter getting louder,  

397
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,880
so he decided to follow the sound.
When he reached the top, he suddenly  

398
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,280
found himself on the ship's funnel. It was dark, 
and a strong sea wind took his breath away.  

399
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,520
He was scared and excited at the same time. He 
thought the funnel would be hot, but it was not.  

400
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,520
It was at an angle, and he was looking up into 
the sky, almost touching the stars themselves. 

401
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,440
"They're stars, Lynn. Not lights. 
You were wrong," he shouted again  

402
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,040
(in reality, his shouting woke Lynn up).
Then he looked around and saw that the  

403
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,560
front part of the ship was already 
underwater and the ship was sinking. 

404
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,840
"Lynn!" he shouted. This time it was a scream. 
That was when he slipped and fell and, in his  

405
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,120
sleep, flung out his arms to save himself. But 
there was no impact. Instead he was now standing  

406
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,680
on the bridge of the ship, which was full of 
people from work - from his days at Fenton's.  

407
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,040
People he hadn't thought of in all this time. 
People he thought he'd never remember again.  

408
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,160
People he certainly didn't want to see again. 

409
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,320
Ann and Gary were there, but they were behind 
Dominic, who stood by the wheel in his captain's  

410
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,480
uniform staring at him. He was older now and 
heavier. The way Eddie had seen him at the bar. 

411
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
"Glad you could join us. 
We're only sinking, you know!" 

412
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,880
"What's going on?" said Eddie, looking around. 
The jazz band was playing in the corner,  

413
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,480
but the female singer was not the girl he had seen 
earlier. Instead it was Lynn. Singing a song whose  

414
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
name escaped him.
"Lynn?" 

415
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,320
She didn't look at him. She 
was looking away and singing. 

416
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,840
"LYNN! What are you doing here?" 
shouted Eddie, confused and frightened. 

417
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,560
"I'm the captain. What does 
it look like?" said Dominic. 

418
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,720
"No. Not you. Lynn. What's she doing 
here?" She wasn't paying him any attention. 

419
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,240
More and more people were coming on to 
the bridge. He saw Dima and Tatiana.  

420
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,560
They spoke in Russian. Eddie couldn't 
hear them over the laughter of the crowd. 

421
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,040
"Ssh. I can't hear what they're saying. 
And I can't remember the name of the song." 

422
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,880
"Never mind that, Eddie. We've 
got more important things to do." 

423
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,960
"What?"
Laughter. 

424
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,600
"We're sinking, no thanks to you."
"Why? What have I done?" 

425
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,000
More laughter from the crowd.
A familiar face appeared. It was Neal. 

426
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
"Champagne glasses, Eddie.  

427
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,840
Champagne glasses," he said.
"What about them?" 

428
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,600
What about them?" shouted Dominic. 
"They put a hole in the ship, you fool." 

429
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,640
"That's impossible." Fear 
filled Eddie's mind and body. 

430
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,760
"Oh, really? Take a look around. Glass 
everywhere. Holes in the side of my ship." 

431
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,080
"It's not your ship!" protested Eddie.
"Who cares? We'll be underwater in ten minutes.  

432
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,160
Fifteen at the most," added Neal.
"Shut up, Neal. You're only  

433
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,840
here because of Dominic."
Then he heard a loud buzzing. 

434
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,840
A giant helicopter arrived and flew over the front 
decks. And another. Three, four, five. Dozens.  

435
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,000
Like bees around a beehive. Buzzing, louder 
and louder. They flew around and shone powerful  

436
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,880
lights on to the bridge. So many lights. The 
noise and lights were unbearable. Then sirens.  

437
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,960
Police sirens. People screaming. Eddie covered 
his ears and shut his eyes. He cried out: "LYNN!" 

438
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,280
The noise lessened but the 
lights were bright, so bright.  

439
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,160
He was trying to open his eyes, but he 
couldn't. Now someone was pulling at his arms. 

440
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,080
"Let me go! Let me go!" he shouted.
"Eddie..." Lynn said, trying to wake him up. 

441
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,560
"Lynn?" His eyes were opening. It was so bright.
"It's all right, I'm here," she said, holding him. 

442
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,840
"We've got to get off! We're sinking!"
"It's all right," she said again. 

443
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,160
Then his eyes opened and he was finally awake.
 
 
CHAPTER SIX

444
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,840
Another bad meeting

445
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,360
The next morning Eddie woke early and his mind 
was racing. The house was quiet and there was  

446
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,840
little traffic outside. He felt like he hadn't 
been to sleep at all, and he was still angry. 

447
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,400
Lynn was still asleep. It was 5.50 a.m. He 
listened to the radio for a while until he heard  

448
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,480
the news, and then he got up, had a shower and 
got dressed. By 6.45 a.m. he was ready for work  

449
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,440
and quickly said goodbye to Lynn before walking to 
the station to get the train into central London. 

450
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,320
The train was full, but Eddie 
managed to get a seat by the window.  

451
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,240
It was a fast train with only a 
couple of stops before Paddington.  

452
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
As the train picked up speed and aimed for 
the city, Eddie looked out at the fields  

453
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,200
and industrial estates passing by. He took deep 
breaths and tried to calm himself before the day  

454
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,600
started. He thought about his conference call 
with Moscow at 9.30 a.m., his scheduled sales  

455
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,640
meeting at 12 noon, and a lunch appointment at 
1.30 p.m. with Neal Skinner in Production. Then  

456
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,680
he was hoping to block off a couple of hours in 
the afternoon to catch up on emails and paperwork. 

457
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,480
He got to the office at 8.15 a.m. and sat at 
his desk with a double espresso and a bagel.  

458
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,040
As his PC started up, Eddie sorted through some 
of his papers and wrote a quick to do list for  

459
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:40,240
the day ahead. He logged on to his email and took 
care of a few basic queries, before noticing that  

460
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,880
Dominic had sent a meeting schedule for 10 a.m. 
There was no subject heading. Eddie saw that it  

461
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,240
clashed with his Moscow call, so he rejected 
it and suggested rescheduling for 11 a.m.,  

462
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,080
and wrote a line to ask what the meeting was 
about. To support his message, he mentioned  

463
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,600
that he had an important call at 9.30 a.m. and 
asked Dominic for his patience in the matter.  

464
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,440
It annoyed him to think that his day with 
Dominic was already starting on a negative note,  

465
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,320
but he tried to put it to the back of his mind.
By 9 a.m. the open-plan office was filling up, and  

466
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Maxine, Paula and Gavin arrived, who all worked in 
Eddie's department and sat near him in the office. 

467
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,800
"Hi, Ed! How's it going?" asked Paula.
"Fine, thanks," replied Eddie. 

468
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,600
"How was the meeting with Dominic yesterday?" 
asked Gavin. "Oh, well, you know. A challenge,  

469
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,080
shall we say," said Eddie, trying 
to smile and not give too much away. 

470
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,840
"I bet it was. Rather you than me, mate," 
said Gavin. Eddie knew that Gavin and the  

471
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,200
team were on his side, but what could they do?
Eddie went back to dealing with his emails and  

472
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,160
preparing for the call to Moscow at 9.30 a.m.
At 9.20 a.m. his phone rang. It was Dominic.  

473
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,240
"Did you get the meeting schedule 
I sent? 10 a.m. this morning." 

474
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,440
"Yes, I replied. I can't do that time. I've got 
a call at 9.30 with Dima and his team in Moscow.  

475
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,800
I'm dialing in Adam in IT, who needs an update on 
the platform they're using for the new software." 

476
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,040
"It's too early for IT. Why are 
you bothering them with this?" 

477
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,920
"Because we need their input on..."
"Look, Eddie. Forget IT and forget  

478
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,640
your call. Do it tomorrow."
"I can't. It's taken ages to  

479
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,880
find a time when we can all..."
"You and I have a meeting at 10." 

480
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,080
"What about?"
"Let's discuss that then. OK?" Dominic hung up. 

481
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,720
Eddie glanced around and 
noticed Maxine looking at him. 

482
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,360
"You OK?" she asked.
"Not really. Max,  

483
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,320
can you get hold of Dima for me and ask if he can 
reschedule the call for any time this afternoon?" 

484
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,160
"He won't like it," she said.
"I know. Tell him I'm really sorry,  

485
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,600
and tell him Dominic has to see me at 10 a.m. Tell 
him I didn't have any warning. He'll understand."  

486
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,000
Eddie tried to smile again. This smile was more 
fake than the last, and Maxine could see it. 

487
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,480
"OK," she said.
Eddie calmly got up out  

488
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,760
of his seat and walked across to the far side 
of the office floor, took the lift upstairs  

489
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,840
and went into the gents' toilet. It was empty.
He went to the sink, turned on the cold tap,  

490
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,240
collected water in his cupped hands and 
splashed it on his face to freshen up.  

491
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,320
The situation was impossible, he thought. 
Eddie felt he could no longer do his job. 

492
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,920
For a moment or two he stayed where 
he was, leaning over the sink,  

493
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,360
staring at the pouring water and watching 
it go down the plughole. Then he looked up,  

494
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,400
reached for some towels and dried his face.
At that moment the phone in his pocket  

495
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,120
announced the arrival of a text with the 
sound of a mystical harp. It was from Lynn.
 

496
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,040
sorry about last night, hope 
u r ok. stay strong. D is a  

497
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:09,120
useless robot and he knows it. love u. L. x
 
Eddie smiled and punched back a quick reply: 

498
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,600
thanks, love u 2. X
 
The text and cold water  

499
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,200
seemed to give Eddie enough strength to go 
back and face another meeting with Dominic.  

500
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,520
It was almost ten o'clock. He had enough time to 
grab a coffee before going to Dominic's office. 

501
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,640
Eddie knocked on the door, walked in and sat 
down. Dominic was engrossed in something on his  

502
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,280
PC. Without looking up he muttered, "I'll be with 
you in a moment," and spent the next five minutes  

503
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,960
doing more work and ignoring Eddie. He even made 
a phone call to someone Eddie had never heard of.  

504
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,480
Eventually, Dominic turned his attention 
away from his computer and on to Eddie. 

505
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,360
"Right. What's the latest from Moscow?" 

506
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,880
"I haven't called them yet."
"Why not?" Dominic's tone was sharp.  

507
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,960
Eddie was always amazed at how unpleasant and cold 
this man was. Was he like this at home? What kind  

508
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,200
of friends did he have? Did he have any friends?
"I had a call planned for this morning at 9.30,  

509
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,920
but you asked me to change it so 
that we could have this meeting." 

510
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,560
"So when are you talking to them?"
"I don't know yet," said Eddie. 

511
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,040
"You need to get a call 
sorted as soon as possible." 

512
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,960
"Maxine's doing that now."
"Maxine shouldn't be doing  

513
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,240
that sort of thing. She's only a temp."
"Well, she sometimes takes phone calls  

514
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,320
for us in the office and sets UP meetings."
"She's not a secretary, Eddie, she's a student!  

515
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,880
She types in data. You can't ask her 
to phone our biggest customers..." 

516
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,160
Eddie's face was red, he could feel 
it. Already things were out of control. 

517
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,240
"She's only setting up a 
conference call," he said. 

518
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,960
"Do it yourself," said Dominic impatiently.
"Fine," Eddie. It wasn't fine at all. 

519
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,200
"And copy me in on the schedule. 
I want to join the call." 

520
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,920
"Why?"
"I want to find  

521
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,000
out when Dima's going to order the rest of the 
software for all the offices in the region." 

522
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,320
"Dominic, please leave that to me. This call 
is more for product training and looking at any  

523
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,040
specific problems so far. I don't want 
to distract him with pressure for more  

524
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,120
orders. We have time for that."
"We don't have time, Eddie." 

525
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,520
"Yes, we do. At least until my next visit to 
Moscow. That's when we will be looking at the next  

526
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,640
orders. As a matter of fact I've got a meeting 
with Neal in Production today to look at costs." 

527
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,160
There was a knock on the door and Neal Skinner, 
Head of Production, walked into the office. 

528
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,800
"Well, well. Here he is!" said Dominic. "Come 
in, Neal. We were just talking about you." 

529
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,240
"Nothing bad, I hope," said 
Neal. His smile was insincere. 

530
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,680
He was a very tall, thin man who 
always looked pale and wore dull suits.  

531
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,000
The Grey Man, they called him in the office. 
Neal was Eddie's main contact in Production  

532
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
for all things related to the Moscow project. 

533
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,800
He was a cold character who 
took himself very seriously  

534
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,640
and had little sense of humor. Like Dominic, 
he had a superior manner and was stubborn.  

535
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,960
When engaged in conversation he looked at the 
other person critically, judging them negatively.  

536
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,640
Neal always tried to give the impression that 
he knew everyone and that he was in charge,  

537
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,520
but it was clear he was not really comfortable in 
his role and didn't really know what he was doing.  

538
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,840
He hid behind business jargon, name-dropping 
and things he had learned from going on too many  

539
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,400
training courses. But bosses liked him. Employees 
and customers did not. They thought he was a waste  

540
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,400
of time. Eddie knew he was a waste of time.
"Neal, thanks for joining us." 

541
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,400
"No problem," Neal replied. So 
agreeable. So good with a boss around.  

542
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,320
Neal crossed his long legs and folded his arms.
Eddie now had a feeling that this meeting had been  

543
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,680
arranged, and that Neal was part of it. It was no 
coincidence that he had turned up at that point. 

544
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,960
"Did you see the match last night?" 
Neal asked Dominic. Still no smile. 

545
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,080
"No, I missed it. I heard that new 
defender Slater scored an own goal  

546
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:26,160
and saved us. That was very kind, thank you."
"We're still five points ahead of you, though." 

547
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,880
"Not for long. You've got Chelsea on Saturday, and 
then you're away to Liverpool the following week." 

548
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,040
"Gentlemen," interrupted Eddie, "if it's OK 
with you... could we get back to business?" 

549
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,440
"The thing is, Eddie," said Dominic, "we 
need more people on the Moscow account..." 

550
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,960
Eddie wasn't sure where this was going, but he 
was slightly encouraged by the possibility of  

551
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,840
getting more assistance. "Right. That's 
good," he said, trying to be positive.  

552
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,680
"We're short-staffed, as you 
know, and we could use more help."  

553
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,280
But he still wasn't sure why Neal was 
there - he remained still and quiet,  

554
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,600
looking first at Dominic and then at Eddie.
"... so Neal has agreed to take charge and  

555
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:15,280
give you guys a hand." Dominic looked back at 
his computer screen, then tapped something on  

556
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,840
his keyboard. Eddie looked at Neal.
"Take charge of what,  

557
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,920
exactly?" he asked, looking back at Dominic.
"Take charge of the account. In Moscow."  

558
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,160
Dominic gave a little laugh.
Eddie went cold. He could feel the sharp blade  

559
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:39,040
of realization enter his back. "Are you moving 
to Moscow, Neal?" he asked, confused but hopeful. 

560
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,960
"No, mate. I'm staying in London." 
Neal smiled his superior smile. 

561
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,840
Eddie did not like the sound of this. 
He didn't like being laughed at either. 

562
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,680
Eddie turned his attention to Dominic. "Dominic, 
I don't quite follow. What's going on?" 

563
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,000
"I've decided to make some changes in the team. 
Neal has a lot of experience in this field, so  

564
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,600
you will report to him. He is now Head of Product 
and Business Development. It's a new position." 

565
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,440
Neal kept his eyes on Dominic the whole time. 
He looked very pleased with himself, as if he  

566
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,800
was waiting to be given a trophy of some sort.
'It makes sense, Eddie. Really," said Neal. 

567
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,000
"I'm not interested in your opinion," 
snapped Eddie. He was trying to stay calm  

568
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
but inside he was ready to explode. He tried 
to keep his voice steady. He leaned forward  

569
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,840
on Dominic's desk and looked him in the eye.
"So what's my position?" he asked.
 
 

570
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,160
CHAPTER SEVEN

571
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,840
An encounter in Barbados

572
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,880
The Parvina docked quietly 
at Bridgetown, Barbados,  

573
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,560
at 7.20 a.m. Eddie and Lynn were already 
awake and they lay in bed listening to  

574
00:52:52,560 --> 00:53:00,160
the radio. At 7.30 there was a knock on the door.
"Good morning. Breakfast," said the voice outside. 

575
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,560
Eddie got out of bed, almost believing 
he would step into cold water once more,  

576
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:11,040
and opened the door. A young, smiling man brought 
in a large tray full of cereals, orange juice,  

577
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,880
pastries and a cafeteria of coffee. Eddie led him 
through the cabin to the balcony door, which he  

578
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:24,080
opened. The humid air struck him immediately.
"Phew, it's warm. Leave the tray inside," he  

579
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,200
said to the man. "Thanks." Eddie gave 
him a few dollars and the man left. 

580
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,880
Eddie looked out across the harbour 
view to where blue sea met white sand,  

581
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,960
to the houses dotted about the town, and to 
the green palm trees inland. Market stalls were  

582
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,000
already being set up near the ship, where locals 
could sell souvenirs and fruit to the passengers.  

583
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:52,880
Eddie heard the distinctive metallic sound of a 
steel band and saw five boys playing down below.  

584
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,400
He could see at least three other ships 
in the harbour. Given his nightmare,  

585
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,680
he really appreciated the fact 
that this was the reality. 

586
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,800
"Good morning, Mrs Millionaire. 
Another day in paradise," he said. 

587
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,360
"What's for breakfast?" asked Lynn, yawning.
"Get up and have a look." 

588
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,600
"You seem very awake and lively," she said.
"Yes, well, after last night's trip  

589
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,800
to hell and back, this comes as a relief."
"You were in a terrible state. Do you remember?" 

590
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,280
"Yes. I'm trying not to think about it," said 
Eddie. And he really was trying not to think about  

591
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,680
it - about the dream, about Dominic Stephens, 
about the real nightmare of sixteen years ago.  

592
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,320
But he knew it wouldn't be easy.
"Damn him," he said under his breath. 

593
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,840
Lynn and Eddie had decided to do different things 
that day. Eddie had chosen to go on a catamaran  

594
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:55,760
and snorkeling trip in the morning, while Lynn 
had booked tennis lessons. They took a taxi to  

595
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,560
the Tropical Beach Hotel and Spa, where they 
were welcomed with fruit punch and given a short  

596
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,720
talk about the area by one of the hotel guides.
The catamaran was scheduled to depart from the  

597
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,880
hotel's private beach at 10.30 a.m., and Eddie 
put on his life jacket and joined several other  

598
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:19,360
passengers and hotel guests for the two-hour 
trip. He was given a mask, snorkel and fins,  

599
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,640
and he waved to Lynn as he walked down to where 
the boat was tied up. He was carrying his deck  

600
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:30,640
shoes and had a towel in his hand as he made 
his way, barefoot, across the fine, smooth sand. 

601
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,920
As he waited his turn to get on board, he looked 
down at his feet in the warm, green water and  

602
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,880
thought again about the nightmare and about 
Dominic. He wondered where Dominic was today.  

603
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,760
Was he on a trip? Was he even still on board?
In the taxi on the way to the hotel,  

604
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,560
Eddie had worried that Dominic 
would be on the same excursion.  

605
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,240
But how likely was it that he would meet him? 
He started feeling angry again that Dominic was  

606
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,800
on the ship. And that he still existed at all.
In spite of this, Eddie was able to relax during  

607
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:11,040
the boat trip. After an hour of sailing around the 
bay and past some spectacular beaches and coves,  

608
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,840
the catamaran dropped anchor and the small 
group went snorkeling near an old shipwreck.  

609
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,120
They watched and fed some stingrays, and 
Eddie enjoyed the calming effect of being  

610
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:27,280
below the surface and in a very different world 
underwater. He was a good swimmer and very fit.  

611
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,640
He had swum for his school and his university, 
and he had won medals for long-distance swimming.  

612
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,280
Even now, at home, he tried to get to 
the local pool at least twice a week. 

613
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,560
When he got back to the beach hotel, 
he was feeling tired but refreshed.  

614
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,400
He'd caught the sun too, and his forehead and 
nose were burnt. He found Lynn sitting on a sun  

615
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,760
lounger by a small pool with fountains. She 
was reading and sipping another fruit punch. 

616
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,240
"Hello, you. I thought I'd 
find you here," he said. 

617
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,960
"Oh, hi. How was it?"
"Brilliant." 

618
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,120
"You've caught the sun."
"I know. I forgot to take some decent sun block.  

619
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,080
I borrowed some off the guys on the 
boat, but I think it was too late." 

620
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,760
"Here," she said, reaching 
for some cream in her bag.  

621
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,240
"Use some of this." She passed him a tube 
of cream and Eddie squeezed some into his  

622
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,880
hand and rubbed it on his face.
"How was the tennis?" he asked. 

623
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,960
"It was cancelled. The guy never turned up, 
and it was too late to get another trainer." 

624
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,800
"Really? That's not good. 
We've already paid for it." 

625
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,280
"I know," said Lynn, "but they're 
giving us lunch for free instead,  

626
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,000
so I don't mind really. I'm booked for tennis 
again in St Lucia in a few days, so that's OK." 

627
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,880
He mocked her: "Listen to you! I 'm booked 
for tennis again in St Lucia in a few days,  

628
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,560
she says, sipping her cocktail." Then he said,  

629
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,200
"This is the life, eh?"
"It certainly is. Oh, look, here's Jen." 

630
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,480
"Who's Jen?" asked Eddie, looking 
around. He thought she looked familiar. 

631
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,200
"She was booked for the tennis as well, so we 
came here for a drink instead and we started  

632
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,080
chatting. You'll never guess who she is."
"I know her, don't I?" asked Eddie. 

633
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,880
"Yes and no. The same thing happened 
to me when I first saw her." 

634
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,080
"She's from the ship. She must be," he said. Jen 
was almost at the pool where they were sitting. 

635
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,480
"Yes. Not only that. She's 
the singer in the band!" 

636
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,760
"Oh yes!" said Eddie, turning to meet her. 
She had on wide sunglasses and a baseball cap.  

637
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,720
She wore a colourful sarong with palm 
tree patterns, and her T-shirt was orange  

638
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,160
with a black saxophone logo. She was carrying a 
drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other. 

639
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:51,600
"Hi, Lynn. Is this your man then?" asked Jen.
"Yes, this is Eddie. Eddie, this is Jen." 

640
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,600
"Nice to meet you, Jen," 
Eddie said, shaking her hand. 

641
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,560
"Likewise," she said. "How was the boat trip?"
"Great, thanks. They took us around some  

642
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,720
fabulous beaches. Then we stopped and 
swam off the reef near an old shipwreck." 

643
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,040
"Cool!" said Jen.
"Some stingrays came by and  

644
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,880
we were given some food for them."
"Oh, I'd love to do that,  

645
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,680
but I'd be terrified," said Jen.
"They're not that dangerous actually,  

646
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,360
although they can give you a nasty bite."
"Ugh!" said Lynn. 

647
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,360
"Or sting with their tail," added Jen.
"Yeah, well, that's true. It's rare, though," said  

648
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,160
Eddie. "That usually happens if you stand on one 
when they're buried in the sand in shallow water." 

649
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,880
"Aren't you afraid of sharks?" asked 
Jen, lifting up her sunglasses. 

650
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,640
"I try not to stand on 
sharks," said Eddie, smiling. 

651
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,320
"You know what I mean."
"There weren't any in the  

652
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,160
area we were in," said Eddie, sitting 
down on a sun lounger next to his wife. 

653
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,040
"How do you know?" asked Lynn.
"Well, you don't. You have to  

654
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,640
hope that there aren't any."
"You must be mad," said Jen. 

655
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,360
"It's worth it. The fish you can 
see near the reef are so beautiful." 

656
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,440
"Well, Jen and I have been doing as 
little as possible, haven't we, Jen?" 

657
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
"Absolutely," said Jen, sitting back 
on her lounger and sipping her drink. 

658
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,120
"So, no tennis, then?" asked Eddie. 

659
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,520
"No," said Jen. "But we get 
a free lunch," she added. 

660
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,720
"So I heard," said Eddie. 
"What are you doing later?" 

661
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:28,080
"Well, my partner will be here soon and 
we're booked to go on the Island Safari." 

662
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:33,120
"Oh, I saw that in the brochure," said Lynn. "Is 
that the trip where you get a private jeep and go  

663
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,880
around the island and see the Wildlife Reserve?"
"Yes, that's it. I love all the animal trips.  

664
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,240
I can't wait. Dominic isn't keen at all, but he 
says he doesn't mind as long as he gets his golf,  

665
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:52,400
Typical! It's like he's married to the stupid 
game. I find it so dull. He loves it, though.  

666
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,160
Do you play golf, Eddie?"
 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT

667
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,200
Eddie's departure

668
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,200
"So, what's your position?" asked Clive 
later that evening at Eddie house.  

669
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,760
Eddie had come straight home after the 
meeting and no one had been able to reach him.  

670
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,320
Clive had been worried, and so he ha 
called in to see Eddie after work. 

671
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:19,040
"That's what I said," replied Eddie.
"And what did he say?" asked Clive. 

672
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:26,080
Lynn, clearly angry and upset, interrupted at 
this point to add, "Oh Clive, listen to this..." 

673
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:34,080
Eddie was trying to stay calm. He was in shock. 
"He couldn't give me a straight answer. He went on  

674
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,880
and on about budget control, an Neal's experience 
in Austria when he was with Gallagher's." 

675
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,920
"Neal doesn't do anything. And 
Austria is very different from Russia.  

676
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,520
Doesn't he realize that? This 
project is completely different." 

677
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,440
"I know, Clive, I said all that. There was 
nothing I could say. When I got a chance to speak,  

678
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,480
he either didn't listen or simply interrupted. 
Or Neal joined in with a useless reason to  

679
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,920
justify himself. It was pathetic to watch."
"No one at Gallagher's has a good word to say  

680
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,040
about Neal, or the work he did in Austria. 
In fact, the rumor is that he was sacked  

681
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:14,560
because he messed it up. That's how he got into 
Fenton's in the first place. He needed a job  

682
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,160
and Dominic is an old mate of his 
from university. It makes me sick." 

683
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,400
"I know." That was all Eddie could say. 
He was so tired. He rubbed his eyes. 

684
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:30,000
"So there's no position for you?" asked 
Clive, but he could see the answer coming. 

685
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,400
"Right," said Eddie.
"They're making you redundant, then?" 

686
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,720
"No."
Clive was confused,  

687
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,880
and Eddie could not bring himself to 
say any more. So Lynn continued for him.  

688
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,840
"They fired him," she said.
There was a brief silence. 

689
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:53,840
"They what"
"Can you believe it? It's disgusting," said Lynn. 

690
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,760
Clive turned to Eddie. "I 
don't believe it," he said. 

691
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,520
"Neither do I," said Eddie, staring into space.
"Fired for what?" 

692
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,040
"He's using the issue about the 
25,000 pounds in last year's budget,  

693
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,440
but he also said I was a negative influence 
on the project and not hands-on enough'." 

694
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,960
"You have got to be joking!" Neither Eddie 
nor Lynn said anything. It was no joke. 

695
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,400
"You're very hands-on. The other day he 
said you were too hands-on, didn't he?" 

696
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,000
"Exactly," said Eddie.
"And in what way are you  

697
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,600
negative? You are more enthusiastic and positive 
than the two of them put together," said Clive. 

698
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:41,680
Eddie didn't say anything.
"He just wants a yes-man," continued Clive.  

699
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,720
"Neal is the true corporate yes-man. He 
plays the game and does what he's told.  

700
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,040
But he's useless otherwise, and too 
frightened to say anything and rock the boat." 

701
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,160
"Who would want to be like that?"
"These guys think they're above everyone else.  

702
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,640
It's as simple as that. They have no idea 
what other people really think of them.  

703
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,480
They either scare you so you won't tell them, or 
they just talk over you in case they look weak." 

704
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,840
"Meanwhile, Neal gets a job 
and Eddie doesn't," said Lynn. 

705
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,160
"It's funny, but I really don't care anymore," 
said Eddie. "They deserve each other. I don't want  

706
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:25,360
to be a part of their grey world with their grey 
suits and grey ideas. They have no imagination.  

707
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:32,640
Only a selfish need to justify themselves."
"They can't do this, surely?" Lynn asked Clive. 

708
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,040
"They can and they have."
"But it's unfair dismissal.  

709
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,760
You can take them to a tribunal."
"I'm not sure I can cope with that," said Eddie. 

710
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,880
"But you have to," said Lynn. 
"You've got to fight it." 

711
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,240
"All I do with him is fight. Now 
he has Neal to do his fighting.  

712
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,840
And he says he has the full support 
of Ann and Gary, so they're no help." 

713
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,640
"You should have played more golf, 
Ed," said Clive sarcastically. 

714
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,920
Eddie thought about that for a moment 
and then said, "Now that I have no job,  

715
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:10,400
maybe I'll have the time."
The next morning Eddie went into the office  

716
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:16,720
early again to clear his desk. There were only a 
few people there. He saw Adam from IT, who came  

717
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,720
over to him. He noticed Eddie was busy emptying 
drawers and throwing files and old documents away. 

718
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:28,080
"Hi, Ed, how's it going? Doing a spring clean? 
Good man. Long live the paperless office!" 

719
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,680
"Not exactly, Adam. I'm 
leaving, as a matter of fact." 

720
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,560
"No way!" he said. "I had no idea."
"Me neither," said Eddie, reaching for a  

721
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,960
folder and glancing quickly at its contents. 
He got halfway through and then threw the  

722
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,760
folder into the bin.
"What's happened?" 

723
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,400
"I was fired yesterday," said Eddie. The 
words sounded unreal when they came out. 

724
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,040
"What for?"
"Oh, it doesn't matter." 

725
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,560
"You're one of the best 
people here, Ed. I mean it." 

726
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,840
"Thanks, Adam, but they don't want 
the best here. They just want..."  

727
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,240
Eddie stopped for a moment and looked 
across the office, deep in thought.  

728
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:16,080
"You know what, Adam, I have absolutely no idea 
what they want." He turned and looked at Adam.  

729
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,480
"And do you know what the worst thing is?"
"What?" 

730
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,800
"They don't know either. My guess is they just 
want to be in charge. Nothing else matters.  

731
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,680
They just want to move people 
around and feel important,"  

732
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,720
said Eddie, slamming a cupboard door shut 
and pushing his chair away from the desk.  

733
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:38,880
"They don't think about the people, their work, 
their customers. They don't care about loyalty.  

734
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,080
They don't care about building a business. 
They talk, have meetings and play golf,  

735
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,400
but they don't know the business and 
they know they need us to make it work." 

736
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,880
"You know your problem," came a voice from behind 
them. "You were never a corporate man, Eddie." 

737
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:01,200
It was Neal. Eddie was completely taken 
by surprise. He was both embarrassed and  

738
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,920
furious to see him standing there.
Adam started walking away. "Look,  

739
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,680
Ed, I'll catch you later," he said. 
"Let's have a drink before you go, OK?" 

740
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,960
"Sure," said Eddie, who decided to 
ignore Neal and finish clearing his desk. 

741
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,600
"You need the skin of a crocodile 
in this business, I'm telling you."  

742
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,160
Eddie tried to ignore him and carried on throwing 
away files, paper, software manuals. Everything. 

743
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,840
"Besides," continued Neal, 
"Dominic needs someone like me.  

744
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:39,760
Someone more... academic. He needs someone who can 
talk to him." Eddie stopped and looked at him. Was  

745
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:46,400
there no end to Neal's patronizing arrogance?
"Neal, you're deceiving yourself. Dominic  

746
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,120
wants a yes-man. Pure and simple. 
Now he's got one. Congratulations." 

747
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,840
"You're upset."
"No, really? Amazing. How did you guess?" 

748
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,320
"Look, I don't have a problem 
with you. It's nothing personal." 

749
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,440
"That's so generous of you, Neal. I feel so much 
better," said Eddie, moving up close to him. He  

750
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:13,600
could smell Neal's stale cigarette breath. "Well, 
I have a big problem with you, and, believe it or  

751
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:21,200
not, I am taking this very personally. I guess I'm 
human, not a crocodile. What would you rather be?" 

752
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,840
"I know how you feel," said Neal.
"You have no idea how I feel, and don't talk  

753
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:33,760
to me about how to talk to people like Dominic. 
He needs someone more academic, indeed. What does  

754
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,880
that mean? And corporate. What is corporate?"
"You have to play the game, Eddie." 

755
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,360
"Maybe. But I'm not interested if 
the end result is turning into a grey  

756
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,440
yes-man like you. Ask yourself the question: 
are you true to yourself? I wonder." 

757
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:57,360
"Nice, Eddie. Very professional," said 
Neal, finally showing his irritation. 

758
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:03,040
"And you know all about professional, do you? 
Open your eyes. Really open your eyes. Listen  

759
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,320
to what people say about you. You're deceiving 
yourself and I actually feel sorry for you.  

760
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,960
And if you want a second opinion, go and ask 
people here or your old friends at Gallagher's." 

761
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,320
Neal was walking away now, so Eddie shouted after 
him: "Did they give you a good reference, by the  

762
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:28,320
way? It wasn't redundancy, was it?" Eddie carried 
on putting things in his bag before sitting down  

763
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:33,840
to write an email to all his customers and 
colleagues to inform them of his departure.
 
 

764
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,840
CHAPTER NINE

765
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,400
The fight

766
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,880
As Dominic Stephens came out of the hotel towards 
them, Eddie froze. He looked at Lynn and her face  

767
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,880
said the same. Before they could make an excuse 
to leave, Dominic was already on the cafe terrace.  

768
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:56,080
His hair was grey and combed back, 
and he was wearing white trousers,  

769
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:01,920
grey golf shoes and a green polo shirt 
which was too tight for his large stomach. 

770
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,000
It was definitely Dominic. The same hard face 
but now with a dark tan, though his chin and  

771
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,800
cheeks were fuller than the last time Eddie 
had seen him. He looked older and different. 

772
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,120
"Hello, everyone. New friends, I 
see," he said, putting out his hand.  

773
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,760
In a reflex action, Eddie noticed his hand go 
out to shake Dominic's. He instantly felt he  

774
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,240
had betrayed himself. Dominic's handshake had not 
changed: his palm at an angle, the fingers locked  

775
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:39,520
tight, difficult to grip. Do Not Enter, it said.
Again, automatically, Eddie lifted his sunglasses  

776
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,040
to be polite, but Dominic kept his on. Eddie 
waited for the moment when Dominic would  

777
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:52,000
recognise him. But he did not. This cannot be 
true, he thought. Is this really Dominic? After  

778
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,760
all this time, am I shaking hands with him 
and he does not know me? He looked at Lynn,  

779
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,320
who was shaking his hand, too. Eddie could 
see that she was not comfortable either. 

780
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,880
"Nice to meet you," she said, 
putting on her best smile. 

781
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,840
"How was the tennis?" Dominic asked, 
leaning on the back of Jen's chair. 

782
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,160
"Cancelled," she said. "Then I met Lynn and we've 
been working hard on cocktails since we got here." 

783
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,440
"Ah, it's a hard life," he said. 

784
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:28,160
Yes, thought Eddie. It can be very hard. 
And some people make it harder. His head  

785
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,320
was quickly filling up with flashes 
of memory. Angry words and images. 

786
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,120
"So, what are you guys 
going to do?" asked Dominic. 

787
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,640
"Er, we've got to get back 
to the ship," said Eddie. 

788
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,160
"I thought you were staying 
for the free lunch," said Jen. 

789
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,440
"Ah, there's no such thing 
as a free lunch, eh, Eddie?" 

790
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,160
Eddie wasn't sure if Dominic had 
recognised him. Maybe. Maybe not.  

791
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,280
Or maybe he was unsure and was playing 
for time? He never showed much emotion,  

792
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,160
and behind the dark glasses 
he looked almost robotic. 

793
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:07,360
"I don't really know," said Eddie. He was still 
trying to recover from the shock of Dominic  

794
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:13,600
standing there in front of him after so long.
"Sure. I've been in business twenty-five years  

795
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,040
and I can tell you no lunch is free."
"Right," said Eddie. "Right,  

796
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,360
well, nice to meet you both."
"Come on," said Jen, "stay for lunch." 

797
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,440
"No, really, I've had too much 
sun, I think," said Eddie. 

798
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,400
"Well, we can sit in the shade," said Jen.
"No, I mean I don't feel too well," Eddie said. 

799
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,160
"Hmm..." said Dominic, finally lifting 
up his glasses and having a good look at  

800
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,680
Eddie's face, "... your nose is burnt, 
but you do look quite pale otherwise.  

801
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,120
You look like you've seen a ghost."
Eddie looked into Dominic's eyes.  

802
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:59,600
He did not see any signs of recognition. He 
looked away. "Right. Yes. Anyway. Lynn?" he said. 

803
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:05,200
"Yes," she said, standing up. "I'm coming."
"Well, maybe we could meet for a drink  

804
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,120
after I finish tonight?" asked Jen.
"She's a great singer, isn't she?" said Dominic. 

805
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,560
"Yes," said Eddie.
"Wonderful," said Lynn. 

806
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,360
'I'm off at about eleven, so I'll come over 
to the bar and we can meet you both then." 

807
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:27,040
"We'll see how Ed feels," said Lynn.
Sure. Well, tomorrow then? Or breakfast?"  

808
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,640
Dominic was laughing. "We're stuck together 
on the ship for the next two weeks,  

809
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:38,560
so there's no getting away, is there?"
Eddie had never imagined Dominic on holiday.  

810
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,880
He only remembered that Dominic always came back 
from holidays complaining about the children. "Ah,  

811
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,960
it's good to be back in the office," 
he used to say, "away, from the kids."  

812
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,440
Eddie felt sorry for Dominic's family 
whenever he heard him say that. 

813
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,000
"What would his kids say if they heard him 
say that?" Eddie had once asked Clive. "Why  

814
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,440
did he have kids or a family at all 
if he preferred to be in an office?" 

815
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,960
"Because these guys like to be the center 
of the universe, and kids and partners take  

816
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,240
that away from them. Besides, family life 
and kids are all about showing emotion,  

817
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:20,080
and they find it too scary. That's why they 
hide behind desks and power. Can you imagine  

818
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,360
Dominic or Neal trying to be with their kids? They 
don't know how. They probably didn't know how to  

819
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:30,640
be with kids when they were kids."
"That's so sad," Eddie had said. 

820
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:36,160
"They are sad. They've missed the best things 
in life and think money and status are enough.  

821
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,560
But they are so superior in their 
own minds that they don't know it." 

822
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,080
"So they're actually happy? 
Ignorance is happiness?" 

823
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:50,480
"Maybe. I'm not so sure. How often do you 
see these guys relax, laugh or even smile?" 

824
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,840
"True."
"Well, there's your answer." 

825
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:02,800
"Eddie?" Lynn's voice suddenly brought Eddie 
back to reality. "Eddie? Are you coming?" 

826
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:09,840
"Yeah. Sorry," he said. "See you guys later."
"Bye," said Jen and Dominic together. 

827
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,720
Eddie and Lynn walked back 
through the hotel to the taxis.  

828
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,800
As they went back to the port 
and the ship, Lynn spoke first. 

829
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,400
"Well?"
"He looks older. He's  

830
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,840
still got that arrogant look. And he's put on a 
lot of weight." Eddie glanced out of the window. 

831
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,200
"Are they married, do you think? 
What happened to his wife?" 

832
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,680
"Don't know," said Eddie. "I 
hope she left him. For her sake." 

833
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,200
"I wonder what Jen is doing 
with a man like him, then?" 

834
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,640
"Goodness knows. He's old 
enough to be her father." 

835
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,360
The taxi moved along the harbour 
and passed the yachts in the marina.  

836
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,160
Eddie was shaking his head in disbelief.
"I don't believe it, Lynn,"  

837
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,800
he said. "Can you believe it?"
"No. But at least he doesn't remember you,"  

838
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,480
she said, looking at him. Eddie 
kept staring out of the window.  

839
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:07,120
"Do you think not?" he said. "Oh, come on. It's 
over sixteen years, Ed. If he had remembered you,  

840
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:12,160
he would have said something - don't you think?"
"Not necessarily. You never know with him. I  

841
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:17,840
never knew with him. He's a snake. A fat 
snake now, of course. But still a snake." 

842
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,640
"Maybe he's changed," said Lynn hopefully.
"I doubt it." 

843
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:29,600
The taxi slowed down and stopped near the gangway 
for the Parvina. They paid the driver and got out. 

844
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:36,640
"It doesn't matter if he's an angel now. I'll 
never forgive him. The three things I hate  

845
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,520
most in the world are arrogance, bullying 
and betrayal. He's guilty of all three." 

846
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,480
"Well, let's hope he doesn't remember 
you. We don't have to see them anyway." 

847
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,040
"He's with the singer of the ship's 
band, Lynn - we'll see him every night!"  

848
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,600
Lynn walked in silence on to the ship and 
into the reception deck. What could she say? 

849
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,360
That night Eddie and Lynn had dinner in the 
main dining room, which was full, as it was  

850
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:09,440
every night. As the sun went down and the room got 
darker, Eddie found it harder to see if Dominic  

851
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,160
was in the room or not. Throughout dinner he had 
expected him to turn up, but he was not there. 

852
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:20,080
As they finished dessert and drank their 
coffee, however, Dominic appeared and took  

853
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,320
a seat at the bar to watch Jen.
"There he is," said Eddie. 

854
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,000
"Oh yes. Well, maybe we could go 
back to the cabin, or the casino." 

855
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,960
"No, Lynn. We're not letting 
him push us around again." 

856
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,800
"But he'll soon see us and come over."
"I doubt it. He was always antisocial." 

857
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,320
"Maybe he's changed."
"You keep saying that.  

858
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,280
People like him never change."
Eddie sipped his coffee and said,  

859
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
"I think I need to know for sure if he 
remembers me. I'd feel a lot happier." 

860
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,840
"But why, Ed? What good will that do?" she asked.
"I can't explain." 

861
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,960
"Eddie, please... Look, he's leaving 
anyway. He's not going to bother us." 

862
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,720
But Eddie had already got up 
from the table and was walking  

863
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:12,560
over to the bar and the exit to follow him.
He followed Dominic down the corridor and past the  

864
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:18,400
Starlight Lounge, where people were playing cards 
and reading. He followed him through the door,  

865
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,520
out on to the side deck and to the stern of 
the ship. It was dark, and Eddie thought he  

866
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:30,640
had lost him. But then he swelled the unmistakable 
cigar smoke and he saw him. The earlier breeze had  

867
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:37,440
been replaced by a strong wind and the sea was 
quite rough. He noticed Dominic in a small area,  

868
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,760
alone, sheltered from the wind, leaning 
on to the rail and looking out to sea. 

869
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,880
"Hello," said Eddie, walking up to him.
"Oh, hello there. Getting some fresh air?" 

870
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,920
"I suppose so."
"Me too," said Dominic.  

871
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,200
"Feeling better?" he asked.
"Yes, thanks." 

872
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,720
They both looked out to sea together for 
a long minute. Eddie broke the silence. 

873
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,240
"You don't remember me, do you?" 
he asked, looking at Dominic. 

874
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,040
"Yes, I just asked if you were feeling 
better. We met at the hotel today.  

875
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,240
Your wife's tennis was cancelled."
"No, not here. Back home. At work." 

876
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,040
"What do you mean?" asked Dominic, 
looking at Eddie. "Where?" 

877
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,280
Eddie knew Dominic had been in many companies.  

878
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,720
Creeping his way in, then getting thrown 
out. Dominic called them redundancies.  

879
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,840
Others knew better.
"Fenton's." 

880
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,600
Dominic looked at him and then looked harder, 
using the light coming from the spotlight on the  

881
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,080
wall. "What's your surname?" he asked.
"Munro." 

882
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,640
Dominic appeared to be trying to remember.
"I was in sales. There was the big  

883
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:59,120
project at Zariya in Moscow."
"Ah," said Dominic. "Eddie Munro.  

884
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:06,960
Yes." He smoked his cigar some more, buying 
time. "When was that?" he asked finally. 

885
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,640
"Sixteen years ago."
"Wow, good memory," said Dominic. 

886
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,480
"Not really..." said Eddie, "... you fired 
me and it's not something one forgets." 

887
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,360
"Did I?" and Dominic actually laughed. Over 
the years Eddie had imagined meeting him  

888
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,280
again and confronting him. He had 
never imagined the man laughing. 

889
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,280
"You did, yes. You found a way to blame 
me for a budget loss of 25,000 pounds." 

890
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,200
"It's a long time ago. I honestly can't 
remember," said Dominic, still smoking,  

891
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:46,720
looking back at the sea. Eddie was staring 
at him. His mouth was dry. He was trembling. 

892
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,880
"Well, I remember."
"Good for you,"  

893
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,480
said Dominic, and now his tone was changing.
Less interested. Colder. 

894
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,480
"Actually, I remember you were an incompetent 
bully. You made my life miserable." 

895
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:10,240
Dominic turned around and looked at Eddie. "Is 
that so?" It was too dark to see if he was angry  

896
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,680
or not. Eddie felt that the situation was getting 
out of control, but there was no turning back.  

897
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:21,680
The words were coming out on their own.
"I was very successful at Fenton's," said Dominic  

898
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:27,840
firmly, "and one reason was probably because I 
was able to get rid of useless rubbish like you." 

899
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,480
"They fired you from there 
eventually, I heard. Why was that?" 

900
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:38,560
Dominic started walking away. "An 
interesting reunion, my friend, but it's late  

901
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,720
and I'm bored with this conversation. I suggest 
you leave the past in the past and move on." 

902
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,960
Eddie grabbed his arm. He 
felt Dominic's body stiffen. 

903
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,840
"Get your hands off me," Dominic said, putting 
his cigar in his mouth to free his hand. 

904
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:01,600
"I moved on, Dominic. I moved on after you 
took away my job, my money, my peace of mind  

905
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,680
and almost my wife."
Eddie was angry now.  

906
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,760
The words were not coming out right any more. 

907
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:14,320
"I've seen your wife, Eddie," Dominic 
said, laughing. "I can tell you that you  

908
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:18,000
still need to move on."
"What does that mean?"  

909
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,840
This time Eddie pushed him against the rail of 
the ship and hit the cigar out of Dominic's mouth.  

910
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:30,240
The light was shining on Dominic's face, and 
Eddie saw a mixture of surprise and anger. 

911
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:36,800
"Hey! What is your problem?!" he shouted, but they 
were out on deck in the wind and darkness and it  

912
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,680
was like a whisper. Dominic pushed back against 
the rail, but Eddie would not let him move. 

913
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:49,600
"You! You are my problem!" Eddie shouted. He had 
no idea what he was doing any more. He was scared,  

914
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:55,520
and angrier than he had been for a long time.
"Move away, Eddie. This is unacceptable." 

915
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:03,760
"Unacceptable? Unacceptable? Oh, really? So, after 
all these years you know what is acceptable and  

916
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:10,560
unacceptable. What you and Neal Skinner did to 
me was unacceptable. The way you patronized and  

917
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:18,240
intimidated me was unacceptable. You cheated 
and lied. You were so smug, so superior." 

918
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:24,400
"I was the boss. I made tough decisions. You 
were a casualty. It happens in business. Sink  

919
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,960
or swim, my friend. Get over it."
Without thinking, Eddie brought  

920
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:35,600
his knee hard and fast up into Dominic's groin. 
Dominic shouted out in shock and blinding pain,  

921
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,280
but was able to push his hand hard into Eddie's 
face. Eddie lost his balance for a moment, giving  

922
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:47,520
Dominic time to stand up straight. Dominic pushed 
Eddie in the chest, but Eddie did not feel it.  

923
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,760
He was too busy getting his hands around Dominic's 
neck. He squeezed and squeezed, and Dominic tried  

924
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:59,440
to get himself free. But he could not. Eddie's 
hands were locked around Dominic's throat.  

925
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:04,720
He dug in his nails to be sure. He pressed 
his thumbs. Dominic was trying to speak,  

926
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,040
but he couldn't. He choked out some words 
but Eddie could make no sense of them. 

927
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:17,520
"Just shut up! Shut up! You stupid... 
arrogant man!" Eddie growled at him. 

928
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,400
Eddie could finally see fear in 
Dominic's face, which had gone pale,  

929
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,760
and his eyes stared back at him. Eddie could see 
he was going to pass out, so he loosened his grip.  

930
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,680
What am I doing? he thought. This is madness. 

931
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,480
But the moment he let go, pain suddenly shot into 
Eddie's ear as Dominic threw a punch to the right  

932
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:45,680
side of Eddie's head, and then to his right side 
into his ribs. Eddie was wild and angry once more,  

933
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,480
this time pushing Dominic back on to the 
ship's rail. Hard against the rail. Fast  

934
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:55,840
against the rail. Dominic shouting in pain 
once more. Eddie punching and punching. 

935
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:05,440
"OK, OK, enough, enough. Stop," pleaded 
Dominic, his arms up in defense. 

936
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:12,720
Eddie stopped. He loosened his grip again and 
waited for a reaction from Dominic, but none came.  

937
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,200
Eddie stood back and watched Dominic try 
to stand up against the rail. Dominic was  

938
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:26,320
holding his stomach and breathing heavily. He 
coughed a couple of times. His head was down. 

939
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,800
Eddie was out of breath himself. He hadn't 
been in a fight since he was fifteen.  

940
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,800
It felt just the same even as an adult - tiring,  

941
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,640
frightening and sore. That time there was a 
crowd watching. This time there was no one. 

942
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:48,720
"Don't come near me or speak to 
me again... ever. Do you hear me?" 

943
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:56,480
Dominic was still trying to get his breath. Either 
he could not speak or he did not want to. But he  

944
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:02,320
said nothing. Eddie took one last look at him 
and backed away until he was at a safe distance.  

945
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,680
Then he left the deck and went back inside. 

946
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,720
That was the last time anyone 
ever saw Dominic Stephens.
 
 

947
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,200
CHAPTER TEN

948
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,040
Sinking not swimming

949
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,840
For a few days after his dismissal from 
Fenton's, Eddie actually felt quite excited.  

950
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,000
He was relieved. A great weight 
had been lifted from his shoulders.  

951
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:32,240
But this feeling did not last long, and he soon 
started to feel irritable and, later on, angry. 

952
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:39,600
For weeks he couldn't get Fenton's and Neal 
and Dominic out of his mind. He thought over  

953
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,200
and over again about the injustice of it all. He 
thought about all the arguments and frustrations.  

954
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:51,680
All the work he had done. All the work he could 
have done. Wasted. He missed his colleagues and  

955
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:55,920
a sense of belonging, and he missed going to 
Russia and working with Dima and the team. 

956
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,720
To cheer himself up, he tried to remind himself 
that, apart from people like Dominic, there were  

957
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:09,280
things he would not miss, like emails. On the 
day Eddie left Fenton's for the last time, there  

958
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:15,520
were over four hundred unanswered emails in his 
inbox. Eddie always tried to get back to people,  

959
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,760
but it had become impossible. Every time he got 
rid of one email, a dozen more would appear within  

960
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:28,240
half an hour. The world had gone mad, he thought. 
At first, like everyone else, Eddie had welcomed  

961
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:34,880
the new form of communication. It was neat, cheap, 
fast and flexible. But soon it dragged him down.  

962
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:40,960
He didn't like to admit it, but Dominic was right 
about not reading emails. They were never-ending. 

963
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:46,320
Dominic.
Back in his mind again. 

964
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,240
Many times he had terrible thoughts about 
what he would like to do to Dominic,  

965
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,480
and to Neal for that matter. He thought 
of storming into the office and using  

966
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,320
Dominic's own golf clubs to smash 
up computers and break windows,  

967
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:04,720
and then going into the car park and doing his 
worst on Dominic's Mercedes. The shiny paintwork,  

968
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:11,200
the windows - all slashed, scratched and broken. 
It felt good but his conscience would not let him. 

969
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,840
In the end, he followed Lynn's advice, which was 
to get out of the house more and go for walks,  

970
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:24,560
or go swimming. Keep busy. Get some exercise. They 
lived two miles from their local sports center,  

971
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,280
so every morning Eddie got up with Lynn and then 
walked through the park to the pool at the sports  

972
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,480
center. He made this his morning routine, but he 
couldn't get used to being in a swimming pool on  

973
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:40,720
a weekday morning at 10 a.m. He normally swam 
after work, so it was strange for him to find  

974
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,920
the pool almost empty, except for some elderly 
swimmers and sometimes small school groups.  

975
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:52,880
As he sat in the cafe afterwards, drinking a 
coffee or two, he always felt better. He wanted to  

976
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:58,240
stay there all day and hide. Then his heart would 
sink at the thought of heading home to nothing. 

977
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:05,440
In fairness, Eddie had started looking for jobs in 
the same week that he was fired. But as depression  

978
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:13,680
set in, he lost interest and motivation. Then, 
to his alarm, he lost confidence. In a way,  

979
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:18,400
this was worse than the depression, but these 
were all new feelings and he was overwhelmed.  

980
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,400
Everything he had done seemed meaningless, and he 
wondered how he would ever do a serious job again. 

981
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,120
He and Lynn had enough money saved 
to last for about four months,  

982
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:34,320
but the time soon passed and there were 
no vacancies. His chances with the best  

983
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,360
companies in his sector were also harmed by the 
news of his dismissal over the budget fiasco. 

984
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:46,800
By the time there were a couple of 
opportunities, Eddie was physically unwell  

985
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,560
and his doctor had agreed he was not fit for work. 
It took time for sickness benefits to be paid,  

986
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:57,840
and with the two of them living on Lynn's small 
teaching salary the financial pressures grew.  

987
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:05,040
Bills turned into reminders. Reminders turned 
into final reminders. And final reminders became  

988
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,400
phone calls from angry gas and electricity 
companies, TV companies and insurance companies.  

989
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:18,000
Then finally the bank called. Eddie was having a 
bad day anyway. This was the last thing he needed. 

990
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:26,720
"Hello, Mr Munro, this is CNTS bank. May I ask you 
some security questions?" said a young male voice. 

991
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,880
"Not really," said Eddie. He 
almost hung up straight away. 

992
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,760
"I just want to ask you some security 
questions and then talk to you about  

993
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,840
your account," the voice insisted.
"Well, how do I know you're the bank? You  

994
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,720
could be anyone," said Eddie. He had decided 
to stay on the phone, but he wasn't going to  

995
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:50,320
make it easy for the person at the other end.
"I can assure you this is the CNTS bank calling." 

996
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,520
"OK, then, well I can assure you that 
this is Mr Munro. What do you want?" 

997
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,000
"I can't do that, Mr Munro. I need 
to ask some security questions." 

998
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,560
"Well, my bank told me not to 
give my security questions away." 

999
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,760
"Mr Munro..."
"Ah, you don't  

1000
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,720
know I am Mr Munro yet, do you?" said 
Eddie. "When is your date of birth?" 

1001
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,840
"I'm not telling you that until 
you prove you are the bank." 

1002
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,000
"All right, sir, ask me a 
question about your account." 

1003
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,000
"OK, how much money is in my account?"
"I can't tell you that.  

1004
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,840
I have to ask you some security 
questions first." Eddie hung up. 

1005
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:36,480
Thirty seconds later the phone rang again. Eddie 
considered ignoring it, but he was bored and was  

1006
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:44,240
enjoying being in control for once. "Hello?"
"Good morning, Mr Munro. This is CNTS bank..." 

1007
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:47,680
"Hi, how are you?"
The voice didn't know what  

1008
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:52,480
to say for a moment, but then sprang back 
into action. "I'm fine, thank you, sir." 

1009
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,080
Eddie had to admit that the young man 
was professional. If he was annoyed,  

1010
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:03,840
he was hiding it well. Eddie felt a little 
guilty - the man was only doing his job.  

1011
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:09,280
Then he thought of Dominic and Neal and what 
bosses like them would do to such youthful  

1012
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:14,880
enthusiasm. He realized that the voice was still 
speaking, but Eddie wasn't paying attention.  

1013
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,880
"Sorry? I wasn't listening," he said.
"That's OK, sir. I was just saying that  

1014
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,920
we need to talk to you about your account, 
and I can get my supervisor if you wish." 

1015
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,800
Eddie decided to give some 
ground. This was getting boring. 

1016
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,800
"Go on, I believe you. You're 
CNTS bank. What do you want?" 

1017
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,720
"Thank you, Mr Munro. I just need to ask 
you some security questions. Is that OK?" 

1018
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,480
"Fine."
"Thank you. Can you confirm your  

1019
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,280
telephone banking password?"
"Chinatown." 

1020
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:50,400
"Thank you. And can you give me the second 
and last numbers in your security code?" 

1021
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,000
"Eight and three."
"Thank you, Mr Munro." 

1022
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,800
"You're welcome."
"That completes the security with you." 

1023
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,640
"I'm so pleased."
"I was calling because your  

1024
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:08,320
account had insufficient funds to pay some direct 
debits this month, and your credit card with us is  

1025
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:14,000
now stopped until you make further payments."
"Great. Thank you for telling me. Goodbye." 

1026
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:22,400
"No, Mr Munro. You are currently overdrawn by 
3,478.11 pounds, and the balance on your credit  

1027
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:31,520
card is 4,490.30 pounds I have to ask if and when 
you will be making payments into your account." 

1028
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,560
"I have no idea. I've lost my job and I can't 
work. I'm thinking of doing the lottery on  

1029
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,320
Saturday, so give me a call on Monday and 
I'll tell you if I can pay you or not.  

1030
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,080
If it helps, I'll enter my bank 
account number and see if it wins." 

1031
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,360
"Mr Munro, my supervisor is here. He would like 
to have a word with you. Would that be OK?" 

1032
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,480
"Not really." Eddie hung up. 

1033
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,520
This time the phone did not ring 
again, which surprised Eddie in a way.  

1034
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:06,240
He walked slowly into the kitchen, made a coffee, 
picked up the newspaper and sat in an armchair to  

1035
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:10,960
flick through the pages to see what was on TV.
 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1036
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,320
After the fight

1037
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:19,120
Eddie went back inside the ship and made his way 
to the toilets, where he locked himself inside a  

1038
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,680
cubicle. He was shaking and sweating. He sat 
down and put out his hands in front of him,  

1039
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:32,080
watching the shaking in fascination and fear. He 
could feel the pain in his chest now, and his ear  

1040
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:37,360
was sore. He wiped his face with the palm 
of his hand; there was blood coming from  

1041
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,560
his nose. He used some toilet paper to 
stop the bleeding. He felt exhausted. 

1042
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,800
Eddie stayed where he was for about ten 
minutes. The toilets were empty and no  

1043
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:54,560
one else came in during that time. He almost 
expected Dominic to come in, and he imagined  

1044
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,400
the fight starting all over again. A struggle 
by the sinks, mirrors breaking, doors slamming. 

1045
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,960
He decided to make his way back to the dining 
room. He came out of the cubicle and looked in  

1046
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:13,840
the mirror to straighten his clothes and his hair. 
The bleeding had stopped. He washed his face. 

1047
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:20,160
The dance floor was full and the dining area was 
being cleared. Lynn was at the table talking to  

1048
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:25,040
some other guests when Eddie found her.
"Hello, stranger," she said. "You  

1049
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,920
took your time. Where's Dominic?"
Eddie wasn't ready for a conversation  

1050
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,800
about this right now. "I couldn't find him."
"So where've you been all this time?" 

1051
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:39,520
"I went to get some fresh air, then I 
went over to the Starlight Lounge and  

1052
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,720
checked some emails on the internet."
"Eddie, you're on holiday!" she said,  

1053
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,680
putting her arm around him.
"I know. Sorry." 

1054
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,960
"Come on, what do you want to drink?"
"I'll have a large scotch. No ice." 

1055
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,400
"Really?"
"Well, why not? We're on holiday." Eddie  

1056
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:04,640
tried to smile. His ear and nose were stinging. 
His chest ached. Maybe he had a broken rib? 

1057
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:11,040
"OK. Wait here. I'll get them," she said, and 
Eddie turned to watch the dancing and the band.  

1058
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:18,640
He was calmer now. The shock felt less. He glanced 
over at the band and saw Jen looking at him,  

1059
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:24,400
and she gave a small wave. He waved back, 
but suddenly wondered if she was in fact  

1060
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:29,040
waving to Dominic somehow. He looked 
behind him, but Dominic wasn't there. 

1061
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,320
When Lynn came back, they had their 
drinks and danced for a while.  

1062
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,520
Eddie was tense the whole time, waiting for 
Dominic to launch a sudden attack on the table.  

1063
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:44,320
Or maybe he had gone back to his cabin 
to rest and would wait until tomorrow  

1064
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:50,400
or the next day to continue the fight.
"I wonder where Dominic is?" said Lynn. 

1065
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,720
"No idea," said Eddie. "Come 
on. I'm tired. Let's go to bed." 

1066
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,600
Even as they reached the cabin, Eddie was looking 
around for Dominic, but he knew now that he must  

1067
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:07,360
have gone to his own cabin. He felt relieved as 
they walked in, and he sat down on the couch. 

1068
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:14,160
Lynn was looking in the mirror, taking off her 
necklace and earrings. In the mirror she watched  

1069
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:20,160
Eddie sitting down. "You OK?" she asked.
"Not really." 

1070
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,680
"What happened to your face?"
Eddie laughed briefly.  

1071
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:30,720
He suddenly saw the absurdity of it all. 
"I had a fight with Dominic," he said,  

1072
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:34,640
looking at the bruises on his hands.
"You mean you had an argument?" 

1073
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:42,000
"No, I mean I had a fight. A proper fight. You 
know, where people hit each other a few times."  

1074
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,000
He was trying to laugh again. But the tears in 
his eyes and on his cheeks were not happy ones.  

1075
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,320
Lynn stopped what she was doing 
and came to sit beside Eddie. 

1076
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,960
"You're shaking."
"Yeah." 

1077
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:02,080
"What happened?" she asked.
"To be honest, I can't really remember.  

1078
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:08,240
It all happened so fast. We were outside on deck 
one minute, and the next I was trying to strangle  

1079
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:13,520
him." Eddie made a strangling gesture with his 
hands, and again he saw that they were shaking. 

1080
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:18,800
"What?"
"I know. I can't really believe it myself.  

1081
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,760
At one point I think he was going to pass 
out. I almost pushed him over the side." 

1082
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,040
"Eddie!"
He was shaking his head. 

1083
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,200
"Was anyone watching all this? 
You must have looked like madmen." 

1084
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,120
"No. It was just us. By the lifeboats."
"Where is he now?" asked Lynn. 

1085
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:44,240
"I don't know. I thought he followed me back 
inside, but he must have gone back to his cabin." 

1086
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:49,360
Lynn got Eddie a glass of water.
"Thanks," he said. "Sorry." 

1087
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:56,080
"I can't believe this. You're like a pair of 
kids. It's one thing to find him on board,  

1088
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,040
but it's another to start fighting 
like kids in a playground." 

1089
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,360
"He started it," said Eddie.
"Listen to yourself, Ed!" 

1090
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,080
"I know."
"Look,  

1091
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:11,040
it's a shock that he's on the same cruise, 
I admit, and I know it brings it all back.  

1092
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,400
But I thought the plan was to keep a low 
profile now. Ignore him. Forget him." 

1093
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,840
"How can we forget him when 
he's on the same cruise ship?" 

1094
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,840
"Well, we'll have to manage, and I 
suggest we wait and see what happens.  

1095
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:32,320
If he approaches you at breakfast or something, 
don't get involved. Apologise and walk away." 

1096
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:36,320
"Apologise?!"
"OK, well, maybe not  

1097
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:42,880
apologise. Just ignore him. Promise?"
"Yes, I promise," said Eddie.
 
 

1098
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,120
CHAPTER TWELVE

1099
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,120
Lynn and Eddie argue

1100
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,720
Six months had passed since Eddie's departure 
from Fenton's, and no work offers were coming  

1101
01:39:54,720 --> 01:40:02,320
in. Summer was over and the evenings were getting 
darker. Eddie had lost weight and his relationship  

1102
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:08,320
with Lynn was in a bad way. Either they argued 
over most things or they didn't speak at all. 

1103
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:15,760
One Thursday afternoon Lynn came in from work 
and Eddie was sitting in his armchair as usual,  

1104
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:22,080
watching a TV show from America. A couple 
and their neighbours were arguing over a dog.  

1105
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,200
Lynn was soaking wet. The rain was heavy outside. 

1106
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:33,520
"These people are so stupid," he said, not looking 
up. "This guy says he can't sleep because of his  

1107
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:38,320
neighbours dog, and the neighbour says the other 
guy's been shooting at it with an air rifle!" 

1108
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:44,560
"It's OK. I'm fine, thanks. Don't get up," 
Lynn said, putting down heavy shopping  

1109
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:50,160
bags as she came through the front door.
"So this guy..." Eddie continued, "... the  

1110
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:54,720
guy with the dog, is suing the other guy 
for a hundred thousand dollars in damages!" 

1111
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,840
Lynn was neither interested nor 
amused. She took off her coat,  

1112
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:05,360
picked up the bags and went into the kitchen. 
On the way, she threw the post on to the sofa. 

1113
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:11,360
"But the other guy - the guy with 
the gun - he's suing the dog owner  

1114
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:15,120
because he says the dog barks all 
night and messes up his garden." 

1115
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,840
Eddie knew he had already upset 
Lynn, but he stayed where he was.  

1116
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,840
She was always upset these days. He decided 
to shout out the rest of his commentary  

1117
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:31,040
so that Lynn could hear him in the kitchen.
"And now their wives are complaining that  

1118
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:36,000
the men are obsessed with arguing with each 
other. They've been fighting over the dog for  

1119
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,920
three years, and now they both want a divorce."
Eddie heard Lynn say something from the kitchen. 

1120
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,840
"What?" he shouted.
"Nothing." 

1121
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:53,680
"No, go on," he shouted. "What did you say?"
"Nothing. Go back to your show. It sounds  

1122
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:59,840
fascinating," she said. Eddie got up 
and went to see her. "What's wrong?" 

1123
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,960
Lynn ignored him and started putting 
shopping away in cupboards and in the fridge. 

1124
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:13,160
"What's wrong?" he asked again.
This time she stopped and looked at Eddie. "Erm,  

1125
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:19,040
well, let me see. I get up in the morning 
and go to work while you sit and watch telly.  

1126
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:25,280
I come in from work, and you're still sitting and 
watching telly. I do the shopping, I get no help.  

1127
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:31,200
I do the cooking, I get no help. I try to talk to 
you, and I get nothing. You used to have breakfast  

1128
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:35,920
with me in the mornings, and now you don't get 
up at all! We never go out. Our friends don't  

1129
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:41,360
call us. The house is a mess, and you're here 
all day making it messier. You don't clean up,  

1130
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:45,200
you don't tidy. You look a mess..."
"Thanks very much." 

1131
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:51,440
"... and I don't hear anything positive from 
you about anything. Anything! I'm sick of it." 

1132
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:58,080
There was a pause after she stopped.
"Bad day then?" he said. 

1133
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:03,600
"It's not funny, Eddie. I worry so 
much about you, your job situation,  

1134
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:08,240
money - and then I go into work and I have at 
least twenty - five kids in my class all day.  

1135
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,400
I try to keep them under control 
and happy, but I just want to cry.  

1136
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:19,520
I want to tell them all to shut up. I want to tell 
them to enjoy drawing pictures and singing songs,  

1137
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,560
because after that life is pointless."
"So, you did have a bad day." 

1138
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:30,640
"Bad year, Eddie. Bad year."
"So it's all my fault?" 

1139
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:35,200
"That is not what I mean."
"Yeah, right." 

1140
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:42,800
At that point, Lynn picked up a full box of eggs 
and threw it at Eddie. He ducked just in time,  

1141
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:48,880
and the whole thing exploded on the kitchen wall.
"I guess we can have omelets for dinner," said  

1142
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:55,600
Eddie, but he knew things had gone too far.
"You can have omelets for dinner. I'm going out." 

1143
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,520
"Where to?"
"I'm going to Angela's." 

1144
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,840
"Angela's? That's two hours 
away. When will you be back?" 

1145
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:07,280
"Saturday."
"Saturday?" 

1146
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,320
"Maybe Sunday. I don't know."
"Lynn, please." 

1147
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:18,560
"No, Eddie. I've had enough. We're broke - 
worse than broke - we are in so much debt.  

1148
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:23,440
You've got no job and you can't get a 
job, or you don't want one. I don't know." 

1149
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,480
"Lynn, listen to me."
"You sit in the house all day,  

1150
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,560
feeling sorry for yourself..."
"Lynn..." 

1151
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:32,160
She was crying now.
"... and it isn't getting better,"  

1152
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:37,200
she sobbed. "It's getting worse and I 
hate it. I'm sorry you lost your job,  

1153
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:43,760
and I'm sorry it made you ill. I'm sorry I'm not 
strong enough now, but I can't help you anymore.  

1154
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:54,080
I tried. I've lost you. You're here, but you're 
not here. I want a break. We want a break." 

1155
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,840
"No, Lynn. Please, we have to talk..."
"I'll call you when I get to Angela's." 

1156
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:05,120
She was walking out of the kitchen and 
into the hall. She opened the door under  

1157
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,920
the stairs and took out an overnight bag. 
Eddie could see she had already packed it. 

1158
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:18,800
"I don't believe this. You're leaving me?"
"No. I'll be back on Sunday. Maybe. I don't know." 

1159
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,040
"This is ridiculous. You can't go. Lynn, 
we've been together for ten years." 

1160
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:30,320
She was putting on her coat.
"What about your job?" 

1161
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:35,360
"I don't care about the job. You don't care 
about work. Now I don't care about work." 

1162
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:39,040
She was walking down the 
hall towards the front door.  

1163
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,920
Eddie grabbed her arm.
"Get your hands off me." 

1164
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,800
"Lynn."
"Get your hands off me!" 

1165
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,880
He let go.
"Lynn, I'm sorry." 

1166
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,320
But she had walked out of the door and got 
into her car, and was driving down the road. 

1167
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,400
Eddie stood in the doorway 
and watched the car disappear.  

1168
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,120
The rain had stopped, but the 
clouds were ready for another storm.  

1169
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:10,480
He went back inside and the house felt very 
strange. Panic was in his mind, heart and stomach.  

1170
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,400
The kitchen door was open, and he saw broken 
eggs dripping off the clock and down the wall. 

1171
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:21,680
He sat down on the sofa. The neighbours 
were still arguing about the dog,  

1172
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,840
which was now in the studio, and a dog 
psychologist was trying to talk to it.  

1173
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:31,920
This time last year he was in Moscow working 
on the project of his career with good money  

1174
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:38,080
in the bank, and he and Lynn had even discussed 
starting a family. Now, he had lost his job,  

1175
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:44,400
his money, his health, his confidence, and 
even his wife. Instead of taking the company  

1176
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:49,920
to the next level and building a future, he was 
sitting in his lounge watching a dog in therapy. 

1177
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,840
He looked around for the remote control 
to change channels, and saw the post.  

1178
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,000
There were some letters for Lynn, 
the new programme for the theatre,  

1179
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,520
more bills, and a letter from 
Steve Scott, his solicitor.  

1180
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:10,400
He knew what the letter said before he opened it. 
It was the result of many difficult meetings with  

1181
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:16,000
his solicitor and financial adviser. The 
letter now confirmed that he was bankrupt. 

1182
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,600
Bankrupt.
A death. 

1183
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:25,280
The end of a life with money.
For a few more minutes Eddie  

1184
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:31,440
watched two American adults fighting and a dog 
being hypnotized. Then he put the letter back  

1185
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:35,840
in its envelope and went into the kitchen 
to clean the eggs off his kitchen wall.
 
 

1186
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,560
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1187
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,120
The search

1188
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,440
The next morning Eddie and Lynn walked 
into the dining room and saw Jen having  

1189
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:51,120
breakfast with some members of the band. Two 
men in uniform were also sitting at the table.  

1190
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,880
They were asking questions and taking notes. 
Eddie assumed it was a discussion about the  

1191
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:02,080
coming evening's performance. He was relieved 
to see that Dominic was nowhere to be seen.  

1192
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,320
He still didn't feel ready for the 
inevitable second confrontation. 

1193
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,160
"She looks upset," said Lynn as they sat 
eating their breakfast at a table nearby. 

1194
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
"Maybe Dominic went back last 
night and started another fight." 

1195
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,200
"Where is he then?"
"Maybe she strangled him?" 

1196
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,760
"Eddie!"
"Sorry. He's  

1197
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:31,680
having a lie-in, I suppose. Who knows? Who cares?"
At this point Jen looked across and saw Eddie and  

1198
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:37,280
Lynn. She pointed at them and got up to come 
over. The two men in uniform accompanied her. 

1199
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:45,200
"Hello, Jen," said Lynn. "Is something wrong?"
"It's Dominic. He's missing. He never came  

1200
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:51,040
back last night. Have you seen him?"
Eddie went cold. Lynn looked at him. 

1201
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,200
"Not this morning, no," said Eddie. Lynn 
shook her head to say the same thing. 

1202
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,520
"Did you see him last night 
at all?" said one of the men. 

1203
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:08,560
"Yes, I did," said Eddie. "I went out for 
some fresh air, and Dominic was outside. We  

1204
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,840
chatted for a bit and then I came in. Dominic 
stayed outside. I didn't see him after that." 

1205
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:19,440
Eddie could honestly say that this was 
the truth. He decided not to mention the  

1206
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:24,480
part about trying to kill each other.
"When was this?" asked the other man. 

1207
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:30,160
"Oh, about midnight, I think. Or just after."
"What did you talk about?" 

1208
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,680
"Not much really. The cruise, the 
weather, the food - that kind of thing."  

1209
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,600
Eddie decided he needed to tell them more. 
Just in case people became suspicious.  

1210
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,800
Get his story out first. "I remembered him 
from a long time ago, though," he said. 

1211
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,280
"What do you mean?" asked the second 
man, looking up from his notes. 

1212
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:57,440
"Mr Stephens used to work at the same 
company as me years ago - at Fenton's - a  

1213
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:02,960
software manufacturer in the UK. He was the 
divisional boss for a while. I was in sales.  

1214
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,760
When Lynn and I first saw him yesterday, 
we weren't sure if it was him or not.  

1215
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,800
I wasn't feeling well anyway, so we thought 
we'd meet him later and find out then." 

1216
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,360
"And was it him? You knew him from work?"
"Yes." 

1217
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,880
"And did you talk to him about 
it when you saw him later?" 

1218
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:27,680
"He didn't really remember me, and it was almost 
twenty years ago. I don't blame him. Anyway,  

1219
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:31,760
we're both here to get away from work, so I 
guess that's why we didn't really talk about it.  

1220
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:37,840
I wasn't outside with him for that long."
"Did he seem upset or stressed in any way?" 

1221
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:45,520
Eddie suddenly recalled Dominic's face again. He 
had looked very upset and considerably stressed  

1222
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,440
when Eddie had his hands around 
his neck. "Not particularly." 

1223
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:56,400
"What about you, ma'am?" asked the first man.
"I only met him on the cruise for the first time  

1224
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:01,840
yesterday. Jen introduced us when we all met by 
chance at the hotel around lunchtime yesterday." 

1225
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:06,240
"And how did he seem to you?"
"Normal, I suppose.  

1226
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,560
Eddie wasn't feeling well, so we came 
back. I didn't see him after that." 

1227
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,160
The Parvina returned to Barbados, where the 
cruise was delayed and an official search began.  

1228
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:22,880
Eddie saw helicopters come and 
go, and he saw police coming and  

1229
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:28,880
going at the harbour. There was even a TV crew.
The atmosphere on board had not changed very much.  

1230
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,920
The ship was so big and there were so 
many people, with so many things going on,  

1231
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,200
that Dominic's disappearance seemed only a 
minor problem. It was almost like an additional  

1232
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:45,120
activity for the passengers to talk about. 
Who was the man? When did he disappear? Why?  

1233
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:49,440
What happened? Was he injured on the 
ship somewhere? Did he fall overboard? 

1234
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:56,400
Eddie and Lynn walked into town to get away from 
things. They walked for hours around the streets  

1235
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:01,200
and marinas. Here and there they stopped and 
looked at their map, and read their guidebook  

1236
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:07,680
about the history of Bridgetown. They tried not 
to talk about Dominic, or even to think about it.  

1237
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:12,240
But Eddie could see that Lynn was worried, 
and Lynn could see the same in Eddie.  

1238
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:19,600
Sooner or later they had to talk again. So they 
had lunch in a cafe overlooking a small bay,  

1239
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,680
and Lynn was the first to speak.
"What do you think has happened, Ed?" 

1240
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,960
"I've no idea. I left him 
standing by the rail. He was OK.  

1241
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:35,520
After the fight, he was obviously tired 
and so was I. To be honest, I think we  

1242
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:41,120
were both a bit shocked and embarrassed - and 
bruised. But he was all right when I left him.  

1243
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,320
Actually, I thought he would come after me. 
I was in the toilet for about ten minutes.  

1244
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:52,080
Then I came back in to find you."
"Do you think he fell overboard?" she asked. 

1245
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,680
"Not from where we were. There was another 
deck below, and the rail was too high.  

1246
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:01,840
To go overboard he'd need to jump."
"So, do you think he jumped?" 

1247
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,400
"The man thinks he's better than 
anyone else. Why would he do that?" 

1248
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,160
"Who knows? Sixteen years is 
a long time. People change." 

1249
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:16,400
"Yeah, well, people like him 
don't change. Unfortunately." 

1250
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,440
When they returned to the ship, the police 
asked him to go to the office in Bridgetown  

1251
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:28,880
to give an official statement. Jen had made her 
statement and given all the information she could.  

1252
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:33,840
When she mentioned meeting Lynn and Eddie, 
it did not take them long to follow it up. 

1253
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:40,560
"And you met at the hotel, is that right?" 
asked a tall policeman sitting at his PC. 

1254
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:43,680
"Yes."
"Were you friends?" 

1255
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:50,240
"No, but I worked with him many years ago. We 
never stayed in touch. We were only colleagues,  

1256
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,640
and I never knew much about him or his life. 
I couldn't believe it when I saw him again  

1257
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,640
after so long. He didn't even recognise me."
"So did you meet later, back on the boat?" 

1258
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,960
"Not together, no. As I said, his girlfriend 
met my wife by chance. We met briefly at lunch,  

1259
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:14,720
and we agreed to meet later for a drink." Eddie 
didn't mean to say that, but then he realized Jen  

1260
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:20,160
had probably said that in her statement.
Eddie waited for another question. The  

1261
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:26,400
policeman looked up at him. "How did he seem 
when you met him at the hotel? Happy? Sad?" 

1262
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:34,080
"It was hard to tell," said Eddie. That was 
true. "He had his sunglasses on the whole time.  

1263
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:37,520
We only chatted for a few minutes."
"And did you meet for a drink?" 

1264
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,040
"No, we didn't. We were supposed to meet 
at the bar after Jen, his girlfriend,  

1265
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:46,800
finished her session with the band. 
I met him briefly on deck though." 

1266
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:53,680
"I see," said the policeman, tapping information 
on his keyboard. "What did you talk about?" 

1267
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,760
"Not much really. I was only with him for 
about five minutes, but I came inside because  

1268
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:05,760
I was cold." Then Eddie thought he should 
add something else. "I was hoping to find  

1269
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,600
out what he'd been up to since the old 
days, but I never saw him after that." 

1270
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,600
"Why not?"
"I'm not sure, to be honest.  

1271
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:18,400
I was with my wife for the evening, but we went 
back to our cabin earlier than we had planned.  

1272
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:24,560
We were tired. I was feeling unwell. I was 
unwell at the hotel. Too much sun, I think." 

1273
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:31,920
"Ah yes, Mr Stephens' girlfriend mentioned 
that. What time did you go to your cabin?" 

1274
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:37,760
"I have no idea." Eddie didn't like to end 
his statement with uncertainty, so he added:  

1275
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:43,600
"On the ship you lose track of time. We both 
went to sleep. The first thing we heard about  

1276
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:47,920
Dominic's disappearance was this morning 
when Jen came to tell us at breakfast." 

1277
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:55,440
The policeman nodded and carried on typing.
"So what do you think has happened?" Eddie  

1278
01:55:55,440 --> 01:56:00,880
asked the policeman. "We're not allowed 
to say, Mr Munro. A thorough search of the  

1279
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:06,080
ship and the area is being carried out. If we 
hear anything, there will be an announcement." 

1280
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:12,880
"Is that all then?" asked Eddie.
"Yes, thank you, that's all for now. We  

1281
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:20,240
have your details if we have any more questions."
"OK," said Eddie. He got up and walked out of the  

1282
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:24,400
office into the bright Caribbean sunshine.
 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1283
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:27,840
Swimming not sinking

1284
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:34,400
In the end, Lynn stayed with Angela for five 
months. She told Eddie that she needed some time  

1285
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:40,240
to feel normal again. They didn't argue anymore 
and it was only a separation, but it frightened  

1286
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:46,320
Eddie. When Lynn left and stayed away for five 
months instead of three nights, he really thought  

1287
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:52,880
he'd lost her forever. He was as low, lost and 
lonely as anyone can feel, but he knew this was  

1288
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:59,600
a turning point. Losing Lynn was a thousand times 
worse than losing his job, and he needed to make  

1289
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:06,160
changes. As Clive said to him during that time: 
"When you hit rock bottom, the only way is up." 

1290
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:13,520
It was a mess, however. Eddie's mental health was 
not good, and it got much worse when Lynn left.  

1291
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:21,600
He couldn't find work, and his depression made it 
impossible to do so. Lynn also lost her job when  

1292
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:27,360
she didn't come back immediately. They had to sell 
the house and furniture to cover all their debts,  

1293
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,400
and they were no longer in a position 
to borrow money to start again. 

1294
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:37,360
Steve Scott, their solicitor, was an enormous 
help to both of them, handling their finances  

1295
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:42,880
and their legal problems. He did everything 
except start a divorce action for them,  

1296
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:49,120
and they had Clive to thank for that. Clive 
realized that the separation could not last long,  

1297
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:53,520
and he kept in touch with both of them to make 
sure that it didn't result in total breakdown. 

1298
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:59,600
By Christmas that year Eddie was staying at 
Clive's and Lynn was I still at Angela's.  

1299
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,840
On New Year's Day Eddie called 
Lynn to give her his best wishes. 

1300
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:09,760
"Happy New Year," he said.
"Same to you. All the best," she said. 

1301
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:15,920
"I hope it's better than the last one," he said.
"That won't be difficult. It couldn't be worse,"  

1302
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:20,160
she said.
Silence. 

1303
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:24,480
"It's strange," said Eddie. "We have 
never been apart on New Year's Eve." 

1304
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:28,080
"No," said Lynn.
"What did you do?" 

1305
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:35,680
"Well, you know me. I don't like it much. Angela 
and I stayed in on our own and watched DVDs.  

1306
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,560
Then some neighbours came around just before 
midnight. We got to bed around two o'clock." 

1307
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,000
"Sounds good." 

1308
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,320
"Not really."
"Why?" 

1309
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:51,040
"Well, you know..." she said.
Eddie knew. "Yes," he said. 

1310
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,720
"You?" asked Lynn.
"What?" 

1311
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:59,040
"What did you do?"
"Oh, Clive and I went to the pub and  

1312
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:03,520
stayed there until about one. It was OK."
"How is Clive?" 

1313
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:08,160
"He's here. Do you want to speak to him?"
"No, it's all right. I'll text him." 

1314
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,880
"OK."
A pause. 

1315
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:15,840
"Lynn?" said Eddie eventually.
"I'm still here." 

1316
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,560
"I miss you."
"I know." 

1317
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,000
"Come back. Please."
"I can't." 

1318
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,480
"Why?"
"Because... you haven't  

1319
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:29,840
got a house, and neither have I!"
They both laughed a little. 

1320
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,400
"OK. If I get a house, will you come back?"
"Only if you get a big one." 

1321
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,800
"OK."
"Very big." 

1322
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,880
"OK."
"With a garden." 

1323
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,800
"Right."
"A big garden." 

1324
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:44,320
"I'l1 try."
"And a swimming pool." 

1325
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,560
"Erm, OK."
"Liar." 

1326
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,240
"OK, the swimming pool will 
take time. I'll work on that." 

1327
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:55,120
"Fine. A large bathroom and modern 
kitchen will be OK instead." 

1328
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,560
"With or without egg on the walls?" 

1329
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,040
He heard her laugh on the other end.
Another pause. 

1330
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:10,880
"How are you feeling?" she asked. "Generally."
"Not bad. Clive makes me go swimming and read  

1331
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,120
his car magazines."
"Good for you." 

1332
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,880
"Hmm," muttered Eddie.
Silence. 

1333
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,080
Eddie wanted to tell Lynn 
again that he missed her. 

1334
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:26,320
"Don't give up, Ed," she said.
"I know," he said. 

1335
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:32,560
Lynn was Eddie's motivation to rebuild his life, 
and Clive was his support. But Eddie realized  

1336
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:38,480
that only he could turn things around. He was 
encouraged that over the time he was out of work,  

1337
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:44,720
he had actually started missing his work and his 
friends in the business. Over the next few years,  

1338
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:49,040
Eddie put together a business plan and 
borrowed money from friends and family. 

1339
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:57,040
He began as an export agent in London for various 
UK software companies. He still had a strong and  

1340
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:02,000
loyal commercial network throughout Europe, 
and many of his old customers and contacts  

1341
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:07,120
were glad to have him back. Some had already 
become disillusioned with the larger companies  

1342
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:13,120
like Fenton's, and Eddie's introduction of new 
products and a faster and more personal service  

1343
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:19,360
brought good results. His enthusiasm and 
energy returned, and every day he enjoyed the  

1344
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,800
thought that he was his own boss; no one could 
undermine his plans or take away the credit. 

1345
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:31,680
He set up a small office not far from Notting Hill 
and started off with a part-time office assistant.  

1346
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:38,320
At the end of the first year he had taken on 
three full-time people. By the following year  

1347
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:44,160
he had moved to larger offices and had a team 
of ten. It was the beginning of a sixteen-year  

1348
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:50,560
journey which turned Eddie from a bankrupt, broken 
individual into a confident and very wealthy man. 

1349
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:55,680
Over time Eddie poached some 
of the team from Fentons,  

1350
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:58,400
including Clive, who soon joined him as a partner.  

1351
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:04,640
Clive then head hunted some of the best people 
from Fenton's production and development team.  

1352
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:11,680
With investment from some overseas partners, 
they then created a series of online titles  

1353
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:16,400
for companies to provide general training, 
systems and platforms to run their businesses. 

1354
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:23,440
This was a turning point. Clive and Eddie's team 
developed a unique way of linking online training  

1355
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:28,320
with mobile phone technology, and their 
best-seller was a twelve-module course  

1356
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:35,200
called People Skills for Successful Business. They 
licensed it worldwide and won an innovation award.  

1357
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:41,120
At the awards night at the Savoy Hotel in London, 
Clive suggested they send a copy of the whole  

1358
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:47,040
series to Dominic and Neal, but Eddie said it 
was a waste. "They wouldn't understand," he said.  

1359
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:53,120
"Some people think they know everything anyway. 
Let them suffer." And they toasted their success. 

1360
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:58,640
Business went from strength to strength, 
and Eddie travelled extensively  

1361
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:04,480
to build strategic partnerships using the training 
catalogue of integrated online-mobile training  

1362
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:09,360
(OMT). His contacts and friends in 
business were loyal and supportive.  

1363
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:15,200
Within five years they had offices in 
Hong Kong, San Francisco, New York,  

1364
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:21,200
Sydney, Bucharest, Munich and Paris.
On the day when he and Clive sold the  

1365
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:26,320
business for 20 million pounds, Eddie came home 
to Lynn, who was sitting in the garden reading. 

1366
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:31,040
"It's done," he said, smiling.
"Really?" 

1367
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:36,400
"Really. We signed the agreement 
this afternoon. It's over." 

1368
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:41,840
"Twenty million?" she asked.
"Twenty million." 

1369
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:47,120
"Oh, Eddie!" She jumped up 
and put her arms around him.  

1370
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:54,240
"I am so pleased for you. For us. You deserve it."
"Thanks. Let's open the champagne." 

1371
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,280
"It's in the fridge. I'll 
go and get it," she said. 

1372
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,280
When she came back, Eddie 
handed her a large envelope. 

1373
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,040
"What's this?" she asked excitedly.
"Open it." 

1374
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,320
Lynn tore open the envelope and pulled 
out a large, colourful holiday brochure.  

1375
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:15,120
"What's this?" she asked.
"It's a holiday brochure." 

1376
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:19,840
"I know it's a holiday brochure," she 
said, smiling. "Where are we going?" 

1377
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,840
"We're going on a cruise."
 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1378
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,200
Revelations

1379
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:32,880
Two more days passed with no sign of Dominic. 
Then three days, then four, then five.  

1380
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:39,200
Soon a whole week had passed. Eventually the 
authorities decided to call off the search,  

1381
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:44,640
and let the ship continue on its voyage. The 
shipping line did not want to cause any further  

1382
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:49,760
inconvenience for the passengers. The longer 
they stayed there, the more bad publicity they  

1383
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,720
faced from the press. From their point of 
view the sooner things got back to normal,  

1384
02:04:54,720 --> 02:05:02,240
the better. Cruise life continued and the 
Parvina took Eddie and Lynn, and its mystery,  

1385
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:10,640
to St Lucia, Antigua, Martinique and Grenada.
Back in Barbados, before flying home, Eddie and  

1386
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:16,640
Lynn went shopping and stopped at a cafe. The 
TV was on by the bar, but the sound was off.  

1387
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:22,880
Eddie stared at the news and saw some familiar 
pictures of the ship, the helicopter searches,  

1388
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:27,200
and the same photograph of Dominic that was 
used in all the reports of his disappearance.  

1389
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:33,360
They had seen all these pictures before, 
but this time the report seemed to continue  

1390
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:39,920
with interviews with people back in the UK.
Eddie could see a businessman talking to a TV  

1391
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:46,000
journalist. Then another. Then there were pictures 
of some buildings. They were offices where Dominic  

1392
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,440
had worked, but Eddie didn't recognise them. 
There were pictures of Dominic's house, and an  

1393
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:57,840
interview with an elderly couple. The caption read 
that they were Dominic's neighbours. There was no  

1394
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:02,480
time to get up and see if he could turn on the 
sound before the news moved on to another topic. 

1395
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,160
"Lynn, they've just shown the report on 
Dominic again. But they're showing more  

1396
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:11,840
stuff from home and about where he worked 
- and interviews with his neighbours!" 

1397
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:16,560
"Well, everyone loves a good 
mystery, I suppose," she said. 

1398
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:20,480
"No, I think the story's 
changed. Something's going on." 

1399
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,800
"Well, maybe you should get a 
newspaper or look on the internet." 

1400
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:31,600
"Good idea," said Eddie, looking around. There 
were no papers, but there were two computer  

1401
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:36,960
screens in the corner. Eddie bought a username 
and password from the waiter and went online.  

1402
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:43,600
He keyed in the address for The Times' website, 
and there he saw a headline below the UK political  

1403
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:50,160
news that took him completely by surprise. Under 
a familiar photograph of Dominic, it read:
 

1404
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,960
Missing businessman stole 
thousands. Police suspect suicide.
 

1405
02:06:56,160 --> 02:07:00,480
Eddie couldn't believe it. He clicked on 
the headline and a new page revealed itself  

1406
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:04,960
on the screen. Underneath the headline 
there was a picture of a younger Dominic,  

1407
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:08,880
and a new article appeared. Eddie 
could not read it fast enough:
 

1408
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:15,280
The search for missing London businessman 
Dominic Stephens has finally been called off.  

1409
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:21,440
Authorities now believe that Mr Stephens took 
his own life whilst on a cruise in the Caribbean,  

1410
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,840
leaving behind large debts and 
a trail of fraud and corruption. 

1411
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:31,280
Mr Stephens went missing over a week ago on 
the American cruise ship Parvina some time  

1412
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:37,520
after midnight on 20 June in the south 
Caribbean sea. After days of searching,  

1413
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:42,400
it is now believed that Mr Stephens may have 
jumped overboard somewhere between Barbados and  

1414
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:49,600
St Lucia in an act of suicide. The exact time of 
his disappearance is not known. Search and rescue  

1415
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:54,480
teams have been covering an area of thousands 
of square miles with no sign of Mr Stephens. 

1416
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:00,480
The disappearance follows reports that Mr Stephens 
had recently been fired from Flash Electronics  

1417
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:06,640
Inc. by partners in the firm. It had been 
discovered that Mr Stephens had embezzled at least  

1418
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:12,800
145,000 pounds from the company during the 
seven years he had worked there as CEO.  

1419
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:17,200
Further interviews with police are 
also being held at other companies,  

1420
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:23,040
who have also reported acts of fraud, corruption 
and intimidation in connection with Mr Stephens. 

1421
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:29,920
The sixty-one-year-old businessman was due to 
appear in court on 15 June, charged with theft,  

1422
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:35,120
but failed to make an appearance. He was 
reported missing by his wife, Margaret Stephens,  

1423
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,920
but it is believed Mr Stephens left 
the country on 16 June to join the  

1424
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:44,640
cruise ship Parvina. Friends and colleagues 
spoke of their shock and disappointment... 

1425
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:50,880
Eddie looked up from the screen and turned 
around to Lynn who was sipping an iced tea. 

1426
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:56,560
"Lynn, you're not going to believe this," he said. 

1427
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:05,200
On the last night of the cruise Eddie and Lynn had 
a quiet dinner together in the Starlight Lounge,  

1428
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:08,560
danced for a while, and then went 
for a walk on deck before bed. 

1429
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,960
Although the day's intense humidity 
had gone, the evening was still warm.  

1430
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:20,480
The sky was clear, and bright stars mixed once 
more with island lights on the far horizon.  

1431
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:26,320
Eddie leaned on the rail and looked out.
"I'm going to miss all this," he said. 

1432
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,560
"I know. Me too. But we 
can do it again, can't we?" 

1433
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:34,400
"Yes. Definitely."
"But maybe next time  

1434
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:39,360
we can do it without your ex-boss turning 
up and creating an international incident." 

1435
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:44,160
Eddie smiled. "Well, if he does turn up next time,  

1436
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:48,960
he'll have a lot of explaining to do."
"Unbelievable.  

1437
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:54,640
It's like a story from a film or a book."
"Yes. Truth is often stranger than fiction." 

1438
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:02,560
A pause. Both of them looked out to sea.
"Do you really think he's out there?" asked Lynn. 

1439
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,920
"He must be. He's not on 
the ship, that's for sure." 

1440
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:14,240
"It's a scary thought. He must have been so 
desperate, to jump off a ship at sea. If he did  

1441
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:18,240
jump. Can you imagine?" said Lynn.
"Maybe he fell." 

1442
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:24,560
"Maybe you pushed him," she said, smiling 
and nudging Eddie in the side with her elbow.  

1443
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:29,840
It still hurt where Dominic had punched 
him. The man was still a pain in his side. 

1444
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:33,360
"Maybe someone else pushed him?" suggested Eddie.  

1445
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,800
"Back home there was probably a long queue of 
people waiting to do something like that to him,  

1446
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:42,720
and to all the superior-minded, 
arrogant Dominic's of the world." 

1447
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:49,040
"Sad," she said.
"Very," said Eddie. "Some are pushed and some  

1448
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:55,840
jump anyway. That's the way it is. That's the way 
it's always been. The trick is what you do next." 

1449
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:03,760
Eddie took a deep, relaxed breath, let out a 
long sigh and looked out to sea to the Caribbean  

1450
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,400
horizon once more and for the last time.
And then he smiled. 

1451
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:14,640
It was very clear to him now.
He could easily make out the difference between  

1452
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:20,880
the stars and the lights of the island, and he 
wondered why he had never noticed it before.

1453
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:21,380
- THE END -
