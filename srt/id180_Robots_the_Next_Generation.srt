00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,720
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,880
Robots and Japan

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
IF IN THE FUTURE YOU BUY A HOUSEHOLD 
ROBOT, THE CHANCES ARE IT WILL BE JAPANESE

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,680
Japan is famous for its long tradition 
of automatons, or machines that look and  

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,040
act like humans. In the 18th and 19th centuries, 
realistic human models, known as Karakuri ningyo,  

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,800
or "dolls that trick," were seen in homes, 
theaters, and religious ceremonies. The most  

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,680
common example was a small model of a woman 
in a kimono that served cups of tea to guests.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
These sophisticated dolls became 
highly popular. Interestingly,  

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,800
the great engineer Tanaka Hisashige, founder of 
the company that would eventually become TOSHIBA,  

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
actually started his career in the early 
19th century as a maker of Karakuri dolls.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,560
But Japan did not invent automatons. In fact, 
they have been with us for thousands of years.  

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,360
The word automaton comes from the Greek "it 
moves itself." The 1st-century Greek inventor  

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,080
Hero was famous for his automated machines, 
which included moving dancers and fountains.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,440
There are also many stories from ancient 
China of wooden automatons that sang,  

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,920
danced, or served drinks. Later, in the 12th 
century, the Islamic scholar Al-Jazari wrote  

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,880
a whole book on mechanisms and automatons, 
which included clocks, animals, a waitress,  

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
and even a programmable musical band 
complete with flute-player and drummer!

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
The English word robot comes from the 
Czech language and means "to serve."  

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,960
It was first used in the 1920s in a 
play by the Czech writer Karel Capek,  

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,280
titled R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). The 
play showed a futuristic world where human-like  

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,360
machines did all the work. In Capek's 
play these machines could think and feel,  

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
and eventually they rebelled 
against their human rulers.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,360
By the 1920s in Japan robots were 
starting to appear in department stores.  

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,160
At first, however, they were not 
much more than complicated Karakuri.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,440
The first Japanese humanoid robot was created 
in 1928 and was called Gakutensoku, or "Learning  

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,880
from the Laws of Nature." It was a Buddha-like 
model that used air to move its head and hands.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,160
Its creator, the biologist Makoto Nishimura, 
believed these machines were part of nature.  

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,320
He is quoted as saying, "If one considers 
humans as the children of nature,  

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,320
artificial humans created by the hand 
of man are thus nature's grandchildren."  

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,720
His robot became a huge success 
and toured Asia and Europe.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,480
Nishimura's opinions highlight the Japanese 
attitude to machines and technology and the  

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,840
fascination they have with robots. This 
may be linked to Japan's Shinto religion,  

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,640
whose followers regard all 
things as having spirits.  

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Tools and all objects made with tools 
possess their own special qualities,  

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,760
almost as if they were individuals. Certainly 
the Japanese view of robots is very different  

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
from the views traditionally held in Western 
cultures, which are often suspicious of robots.

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,120
The Japanese look upon robots as 
things of interest and beauty,  

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,160
designed to help humans and make our lives better. 
This view was most famously expressed in the 1951  

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Manga comic, Tetsuwan Atomu. Atomu, or Astro 
Boy, as he was later known in the West,  

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,800
was the first major robot character to 
show robots as friendly and helpful.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,880
The Japanese love of comic book robot characters,  

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,400
together with the country's fast 
increasing electronics industry,  

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,040
meant that by the 1980s Japan had become a world 
leader in robot research and production. Today,  

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,240
more than a third of the world's industrial 
robots work in factories in Japan.

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,280
As well as the typical industrial robots, 
many robots are designed simply as toys  

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,200
or for entertainment. Animal robots, 
dancing robots, car-driving robots,  

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,440
even piano- playing robots are all made and 
sold in Japan. And as technology improves,  

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,280
the differences between humans and machines 
may become increasingly blurred.
 
 
 
 

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,440
CHAPTER TWO

50
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,240
Robot and Recreation

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,480
FOR THE JAPANESE, ROBOTS ARE A 
GREAT SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT.

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,960
Technically, a robot is any kind of autonomous 
self-controlled or remote-controlled machine,  

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,720
often used in factories for dangerous or 
precision work. But when we think of a robot,  

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,480
we often imagine a machine with a 
recognizably human face and figure.  

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,080
These robots are called androids (from the 
Greek for man, andr-) and are specifically  

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,840
designed to have characteristics that 
make them more attractive to humans.

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Japan has a keen interest in humanoid models.  

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,960
Karakuri dolls, for example, were seen as 
more than models; they were respected as  

59
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,800
an art form. The Japanese fascination with 
robots meant that in the late 20th century,  

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,040
when huge improvements were being made 
in motors and computing, many electronics  

61
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,760
companies began to design humanoid robots that 
could interact with people on a social level.

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,840
The first entertainment robot with commercial 
success was not a humanoid, however, but a robot  

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,600
dog. Designed as a toy pet and launched in 1999, 
Sony's AIBO quickly became popular worldwide.  

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,360
The AIBO (Japanese for "companion") 
could walk, could see using cameras,  

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
and had special software that allowed 
it to develop from puppy to adult,  

66
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,080
learning to play and understand up 
to 100 voice commands. Furthermore,  

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,520
special programmable software allowed owners to 
change their AIBO's personality and behavior.

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
Teams of AIBOs have even 
played at the annual RoboCup,  

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,720
a soccer tournament where all the 
competitors must be autonomous robots.

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,640
Humanoid robots have proved 
more difficult to make.  

71
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,800
However, in 2000 Honda finally introduced 
its first real humanoid robot, ASIMO.

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
ASIMO was able to help disabled 
people move around more easily.  

73
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,320
The robot could recognize and respond 
to human movements and commands,  

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,600
and was aware of its environment. It has 
made many public appearances, talking,  

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,840
dancing, and even conducting an orchestra. 
Its little brother, the QRIO made by Sony,  

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,240
could run and interact to such an extent that 
it was also capable of playing in the RoboCup.

77
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
Although the QRIO was too expensive to be 
produced commercially, there are now many  

78
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,200
different humanoid robots available on the 
market. They are generally simpler, more like  

79
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,160
expensive remote-controlled toys, but they are 
all humanoid and have some degree of autonomy.

80
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,720
The lack of easily available or reasonably-priced 
humanoid robots hasn't stopped Japan's robot  

81
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,560
enthusiasts. DIY robotics has become 
increasingly popular in recent years,  

82
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,120
to such an extent that a robot 
championship, Robo-One, was started in 2002.

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,880
The championship consists of a series of 
tasks that the homemade robots must perform.  

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Tasks include falling from a standing position, 
getting up, walking, jumping, and even competing  

85
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
against other robots in a one-on-one boxing match. 
There has also been a Robo-One soccer match.

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,520
The robots in Robo-One are designed and built 
at home by individual designers, but may use  

87
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,440
commercial parts. Many robots are made from 
aluminum and powered by small electric motors.

88
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,000
One problem with two-legged robots 
is how to make them walk like us.  

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Robots look awkward when they walk 
because they constantly bend their knees.  

90
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,960
However, in 2011 the Nagoya Institute 
of Technology produced the first robot  

91
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,360
legs modeled on human biomechanics. So naturally 
moving humanoids may soon be a common sight.
 
 
 
 

92
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
CHAPTER THREE

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
Robots and Money

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,480
JAPAN IS THE THIRD LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD  

95
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,120
AND HAS THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, IN 
WHICH IT IS CONSIDERED A LEADING INNOVATOR.

96
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,160
The Japanese have traditionally been noted 
for the high quality of their craftsmanship.  

97
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,200
European travelers arriving in Japan in the 16th 
and 17th century were amazed at its architecture,  

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
metalwork, and technology.

99
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,440
After the Second World War, the Japanese emphasis 
on quality and precision helped to create strong,  

100
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,840
dynamic industries, innovating in many areas.  

101
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,720
Japanese cars and electronics became synonymous 
with quality, reliability, and affordability.  

102
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,840
This led to continuous economic growth for over 30 
years, which leveled off in the late 20th century.

103
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,840
As Japan enters the 21st century, the main 
problem its economy faces is a shortage of  

104
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,080
workers, a result of an aging population and 
a falling birth rate. These changes mean that,  

105
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,240
among other things, there are fewer workers 
to earn money or care for the elderly.

106
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,240
Many people in Japan believe that the Japanese 
robotics industry may be the answer to Japan's  

107
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,280
challenges, both economically (in 2010, the 
worldwide industry was worth $5.6 billion), but  

108
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,160
also as a technology that can produce workers and 
caregivers for the country's aging population.
 
 

109
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,000
CHAPTER FOUR

110
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,160
Robots and Work

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,320
WILL TOMORROW'S ROBOTS BE 
ABLE TO FULFILL A SOCIAL ROLE?

112
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
What can Japan do to solve the problem 
of the reduction in its workforce?  

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,960
Traditionally suspicious of foreigners, the 
country seems reluctant to relax its strict  

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,600
immigration policy, looking instead to the 
robotics industry to provide its workers.

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,440
What would seem a strange solution in many 
other countries seems perfectly normal to the  

116
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,080
electronics-obsessed Japanese. Robots in Japanese 
society already carry out many different roles.  

117
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,440
Here are a few ways that robots are 
becoming a part of everyday life in Japan.

118
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,120
Healthcare

119
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,240
One of the main shortages in workers in 
Japan at the moment is in healthcare,  

120
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
especially for the elderly. Although 
there are many trained nurses available  

121
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,120
from other parts of Asia, Japan allows 
very few immigrants into the country.  

122
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,000
Consequently, many robotics firms are 
looking at the possibility of robot nurses.

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,560
Toyota launched four robot nursing models 
in 2013. These machines aren't humanoid,  

124
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,760
but resemble motorized chairs, designed to help 
patients move around and get in and out of bed.

125
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,840
A highly innovative use of a robot in healthcare 
can be found in Tokyo's Cyberdyne gym. Here, users  

126
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,880
can exercise wearing robotic legs that recognize 
impulses made by the brain when the person wants  

127
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,960
to walk. With practice, people who have problems 
with their legs can walk around and do exercises.

128
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,800
Security

129
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
Several Japanese companies 
have built security robots.  

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,800
There are robots to guard houses and offices, 
a robot that collects cash from banks,  

131
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,680
and a robot that can stop criminals. The Tmsuk 
Company's T-34 is a small, four-wheeled robot  

132
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,880
that can be controlled by mobile phone. It 
can catch thieves by firing a net over them.

133
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,880
Other robots have been used 
to direct traffic in Tokyo.  

134
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,440
And Fujitsu has produced a guide 
robot for offices and malls.  

135
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,920
It recognizes faces and has a touch screen 
that people can press for information.

136
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,640
Actroids

137
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,800
An astounding example of Japanese robot philosophy 
can be seen in their development of actroids.  

138
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
A combination of the words actor and android,  

139
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,800
these robots are specifically designed 
to look as believably human as possible.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
Robot directing traffic in Japan

141
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,400
The first actroid, presented at the 2003 
International Robot Convention by the  

142
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,480
University of Osaka, was modeled on the looks 
of an average Japanese woman. It had realistic  

143
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,120
silicone skin and could blink, speak, and 
breathe, using air to move its features.

144
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,840
Later models are even more realistic. 
Professor Ishiguro of Osaka University  

145
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,160
believes that human acceptance of robots 
depends on them having a familiar appearance.  

146
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,280
In the future, he hopes that these human 
copies could be used to represent people  

147
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,040
in business meetings and in other events. 
So far, the closest any of the actroids has  

148
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,000
come was when HRP-4C starred as a model

CHAPTER FIVE

150
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,080
Robots and Life

151
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,800
JAPAN'S RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS HELP 
ITS PEOPLE APPRECIATE ROBOTS.

152
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,760
Mindless metal boxes, coldly following 
their programming to the end,  

153
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
robots are not to be trusted.

154
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,240
This, at least, is the impression you might 
get from many Hollywood movies. Traditionally,  

155
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,440
robots in Hollywood have generally played the 
bad guy, an unforgiving, unstoppable creature of  

156
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,400
incredible power, usually only defeated because 
of its lack of flexibility and imagination.  

157
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
From movies like Blade Runner and Terminator to 
The Matrix, we are often shown a world where,  

158
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,200
given the opportunity, robots and computers 
will enslave humans and try to take over.

159
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,360
This view reflects a deep mistrust of machines 
in Western culture, a sense of separation from  

160
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,120
the things we create. However, it is a view 
not necessarily shared by other cultures.  

161
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,520
In Japan, many fictional 
accounts of robots are positive.  

162
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,040
Robots are seen as a force for good, 
as creators of a more pleasant society.

163
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,400
These different points of view carry over into 
everyday life. An American may see robots as a  

164
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,840
threat to his or her job, as an unnecessary 
complication, or simply as a useless toy.  

165
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,280
In Japan the same robot would be seen as a 
way to make work easier and more efficient,  

166
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,040
and as an interesting companion, as something 
fun. This probably explains why there are hundreds  

167
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,080
of humanoid robots being developed in Japan, 
while in the USA there are currently just two.

168
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,320
So why is there such a difference 
between these two points of view?  

169
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Many people have written about the 
subject, both in Japan and abroad.  

170
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,400
It seems mainly to be a question of whether 
and how much something is seen to be alive.  

171
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,840
In this respect, Japan's Shinto and 
Buddhist heritage plays an important role.

172
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
Japan's Religious Tradition

173
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,640
While Buddhism and Shinto are officially separate, 
in reality most people practice them together.  

174
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,160
Buddhism, with its belief in the oneness or unity 
of all things, was imported from China. Shinto is  

175
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,520
a set of religious beliefs and practices native to 
Japan and was first recorded in the 8th century.

176
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,720
Shinto involves the worship of Kami, 
which roughly translates as "spirits."  

177
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,600
These spirits can be a natural 
experience, such as wind or rain,  

178
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,600
or the spirit of a natural place, such 
as a forest or river, or even rocks. This  

179
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,680
recognition of spiritual life in all things and 
actions is known as animism. Although Kami can  

180
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,400
also be the spirits of ancestors or people, they 
are not gods in the Western sense of the word.

181
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,200
Shinto's main aim is to keep in harmony 
with the surrounding world by showing  

182
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,240
respect for the kami that inhabit it. 
In the same way, the tools you use or  

183
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,160
works you create possess their own spirit or 
identity, something worthy of respect. It is  

184
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,560
not surprising that such a belief would give 
rise to a culture of exceptional craftsmen.

185
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
A Sense of Connection

186
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,400
This sense of connection with the things an 
artist or designer creates is very different  

187
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,280
from Western ideas, which sharply divide 
living, thinking beings from lifeless machines.  

188
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,320
Japanese craftsmen's natural respect 
for and appreciation of the machines  

189
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,840
they create becomes even stronger 
when applied to a responsive robot.

190
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,840
In Japan, robots are not seen only as tools that 
exist to make human life easier. As one writer has  

191
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:08,000
put it, it is no longer a question of robots doing 
things for people, but of doing things with them.  

192
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,080
This is a philosophy that looks into a future 
where man and machine live in harmony.
 
 
 
 

193
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,840
CHAPTER SIX

194
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,760
What Do You Think?

195
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,760
HOW WILL OUR LIVES CHANGE IN 
THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF ROBOTS?

196
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,040
Every year, technological advances 
mean newer, faster computers,  

197
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,360
newer communication devices, and more 
sophisticated, more capable robots.

198
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,400
In Japan, this is viewed with excitement. 
Perhaps, due to their philosophical history,  

199
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,080
the Japanese are more capable of 
"understanding" and working with robots.  

200
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,560
Do you think robots will become as 
popular in other parts of the world?  

201
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,840
Will they be as accepted in other 
countries or will they be objects of fear?

202
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,240
Robots will probably soon play a 
more important role in our lives.  

203
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,440
They will be able to move around better 
and perform simple jobs around the house,  

204
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,120
such as painting, cleaning, and other household 
tasks. But will they be able to communicate with  

205
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,680
humans, have decision-making abilities, and 
generally live alongside us on the planet?

206
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,600
The robot brain is based on computers and their 
increasing ability to carry out billions of  

207
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,760
instructions very quickly. But will robot brains 
ever have the same kind of intelligence as humans  

208
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,840
do? Will the computer-based artificial brain allow 
robots to become like intelligent human beings?

209
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,920
Some predictions say "Yes!" Already 
computers can "understand" humans to  

210
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,200
some extent by recognizing our speech. Can 
you imagine having a robot as a friend?  

211
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,920
Will children go to school with robot 
friends who help them with their homework?

212
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,720
How will people behave socially with robots in 
the future? Will they be treated as machines?  

213
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,280
Or will they act so like us that we treat them 
as equals? Will we have to change our laws to  

214
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,800
include the fair treatment of robots? We might 
even have groups fighting for "robot rights."  

215
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,960
For example, should robots be paid 
for the work they do? And if so, how?

216
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,840
What do you think will happen? And will 
it happen in your lifetime?
 
 
 
 
 
 

217
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,328
