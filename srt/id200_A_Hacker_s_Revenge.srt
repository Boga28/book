CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,200
The New Computer System

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,160
At exactly 8.20 Mr Henry Williams 
walked through the doors of the bank.  

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,760
He was the manager and had worked there for twenty 
years. He wasn't always calm and relaxed when  

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
he arrived at work but yesterday something 
had happened to make his life much easier.  

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,360
He looked around the bank. There were 
beautiful new computers on every desk.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,240
Some were connected to printers, others to 
scanners. The CPUs were hidden under the desks  

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,720
and the keyboards waited to be used. On each 
mouse pad was a mouse with a small red light,  

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,280
which lit up when the computer was switched on. 
The VDUs shone as the sun came through the window.  

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,800
Mr Williams smiled. When he entered his office, 
he saw that his secretary had already arrived.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,400
"Morning, Mr Williams," she said happily. She 
was a very nice girl with long, blonde hair  

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
and a big smile but she wasn't the 
most efficient secretary in the world.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
"Good morning, Belinda. Are you looking forward to  

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,360
discovering the wonderful things 
that your new computer can do?"

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,320
She looked worried. "Yes, but I 
hope I don't make too many mistakes.  

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,480
Yesterday I nearly lost some important 
information because I pressed the wrong key."

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,600
"Don't worry. I know you've only been here for six 
months. Mike has assured me that we now have the  

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,960
most up-to-date computer hardware and software 
are the most secure system money can buy."

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Mike Black was the bank's network 
manager and head of technology.  

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
He had organized and set up the new system.

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,920
At that moment someone knocked 
on the door and Mike came in.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,160
"Morning, Mr Williams. How are you?" he said.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,960
"Very well, thank you, Mike. Now, are you 
sure the system is functioning properly? Can  

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,880
I go on holiday next week to the Caribbean 
without worrying about things back here?"

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Mike smiled. "Things couldn't be better. 
Our LAN is working perfectly. It is now  

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,480
connected to the bank's WAN and 
the security access rights are..."

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,240
"Mike, you know that my knowledge of 
computers is very limited. I'm afraid  

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,120
I belong to another generation - which is 
why I pay you to solve our IT problems."

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,000
IT terms were a foreign language to Henry 
Williams. His son Robbie was only 15 but  

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,040
he was already a computer genius and sat in 
front of his monitor for hours every day.  

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,360
He had no problem logging on and off, surfing 
the net or downloading files. His father was an  

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,000
excellent bank manager but unfortunately 
he had no idea what these terms meant.  

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
He was grateful for experts like Mike who 
could decipher these mysteries for him.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
"Don't worry.  

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,160
You can have a wonderful time in the Caribbean. 
Things couldn't be better here," replied Mike.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
He left the office and Mr Williams sat down  

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
at his desk on which there was no 
computer at all, either new or old.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,040
He was dreaming of blue seas and white 
beaches when a cry from Belinda's desk  

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,440
brought him back to reality. "Mr Williams, my 
computer has crashed!" As soon as she had said  

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,480
the words, they heard similar cries of alarm 
coming from the bank's main area downstairs.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:45,840
One by one the computers were crashing...
 
 

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,160
CHAPTER TWO

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
A Problem

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
Mr Williams ran down the escalator 
and into the main office area.  

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
What was happening? All the computers 
were down. Everyone was trying to reboot  

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,560
but it was impossible. Henry Williams tried 
not to panic. He asked Belinda to call Mike  

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
and tell him to come immediately. Then he 
said to his staff, "Don't worry, everyone.  

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm sure it's a minor problem that Mike will 
soon resolve." A young bank teller whispered to  

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,200
a colleague, "He said that last week when that 
virus destroyed most of our files. Remember?"

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,160
His friend smiled. Someone had sent an e-mail to 
all the staff which promised to show photos of  

51
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,960
Belinda's new boyfriend. Belinda was very popular 
with the staff in the bank so naturally everyone  

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,800
opened it. But there was no photo, just a 
virus which corrupted the entire system.  

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
Mike, who still didn't know about the problem, 
arrived in the lift just as strange things began  

54
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,320
to happen. First the lights went off, leaving 
the bank in darkness. Then a client came in to  

55
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,400
complain to a cashier that he couldn't access 
his account from the ATM outside the bank. Then  

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,360
the lights came on again but the doors closed 
automatically, locking everyone in the bank.  

57
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr Williams said sarcastically, "As you can see, 
Mike, our new system is working perfectly. Nobody  

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
can do any work, the clients are angry, 
and we are all prisoners in the bank!"

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Mike smiled nervously. "I'm sure it's 
nothing. I'll take a look at the server  

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,160
and see what the problem is." Mike was the 
only person with total security access rights  

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
for the system and he had the 
only copy of the password list.  

62
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
He was very good at his job so 
he wasn't too worried about these  

63
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,920
"hiccups." He went to the main computer and put 
in his password. A message appeared on the screen:

64
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,680
Access Denied

65
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Password Invalid

66
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,520
Everyone in the bank was watching him. Mike took 
his password list from his wallet. He typed in  

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,920
his password again, slowly and carefully. Every 
time he tried the same message appeared on the  

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,480
screen. "That's impossible," he cried. His face 
was white with tension. Mr Williams was waiting  

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,280
for an explanation. "Is everything OK?" he asked. 
Mike prepared to give his boss the bad news.

70
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,080
"It seems that... someone has obtained 
the passwords for the new system  

71
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
and... has changed them."

72
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,800
"And what exactly does that mean?" asked 
his boss angrily. Mike took a deep breath.

73
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,760
"It means that this person now 
has total control of the bank."

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,880
At that moment the doors of the 
bank miraculously opened again.  

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:47,840
No one spoke. The silence was broken only 
by the noise of the clock on the wall.  

76
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,200
All the staff were waiting 
for Mr Williams' reaction.

77
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,040
"And tell me, how did this person get the 
passwords?" asked Mr Williams quietly.

78
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,640
"I have no idea," replied Mike. "I always 
keep the password list in my wallet.  

79
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,280
No one else has ever seen 
it. It's a complete mystery."

80
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,280
"No!" shouted Mr Williams. "The 
mystery is why I gave you a  

81
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,960
job. First the virus and now this. Well, you 
can start looking for a new job. You're sacked!"

82
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,240
Mike left the bank without a word. He didn't 
look at anyone. He knew that it was his fault.  

83
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,160
Belinda's voice broke the silence. 
"Oh, Mr Williams, what are we going to  

84
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,800
do?" Before he could answer, the 
computer displayed a new message:

85
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:43,840
E-mail arriving for Henry Williams
 
 

86
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
CHAPTER THREE

87
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,360
Are You Ready to Play, Henry?

88
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,600
Mr Williams turned to the bank staff and said,  

89
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,680
"Please, continue to work as normal. 
There is nothing to worry about."

90
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:09,120
Everyone looked surprised. How could they work 
without computers? It would be impossible. No one  

91
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,480
moved and no one spoke. Mr Williams repeated 
his message: "Back to work now, please.  

92
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Our clients will arrive soon and we must be 
ready." As his staff slowly began to return  

93
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,720
to work, the bank manager sat down in front 
of the server. Belinda stood next to him.  

94
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,680
Mr Williams looked at the screen. He was now 
extremely worried. He hesitated for a moment.  

95
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,360
Belinda thought he was in difficulty and she 
wanted to help. "You have to click on the e-mail  

96
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,640
icon in the comer of the screen," she said. "I 
know, I know. I'm not completely stupid!" her  

97
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,880
boss shouted. Some members of staff looked at one 
another and smiled. Belinda knew Mr Williams well.  

98
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,280
She knew that when he was angry, as he was now, it 
was better to say nothing. She watched silently as  

99
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,320
he clicked on the icon. The mailbox appeared 
and revealed the subject of the new message:

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,960
Are you ready to play, Henry Williams?

101
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Yes, he was ready. He had no idea who had 
sent the e-mail but he wanted an explanation  

102
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,920
and an end to this situation. He opened the 
message and the screen filled with words.

103
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
Hello Henry!

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,920
How are you today? Happy? Or 
maybe worried? Or even angry!  

105
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,280
I haven't seen you for a long time but I can 
tell you that I am very, very annoyed with you.  

106
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:49,360
You are not my favorite person. How many enemies 
do you have? AT least one - me! I am going to  

107
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,680
make you pay for what you did to me before. As you 
know, I have entered your new and secure (ha! ha!)  

108
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:05,520
computer system and guess what? It's MY system 
now. It was so easy to discover the passwords.  

109
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,360
You should be more careful, Henry. You 
don't mind if I call you Henry, do you?

110
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Mr Williams was definitely angry 
now, and confused. He asked Belinda,  

111
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,000
"Who is this person? What does he want? Or maybe 
it's a woman? Why is he (or she) angry? I'm an  

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,480
honest and respectable man and people like me 
- well, most people. Isn't that true, Belinda?"  

113
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,960
He turned to look at Belinda, hoping that she 
would give him the answer he wanted to hear,  

114
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,080
but she wasn't listening. She was reading 
the rest of the message as it appeared...

115
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,320
I have changed all the passwords so now I 
control everything in your bank. Be nice to me  

116
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:53,360
or I will lock the door again - or perhaps I'll 
do something much worse! But don't be afraid;  

117
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,760
I know that you're an intelligent (ha! 
ha!) man, Henry, so I am going to give  

118
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,480
you a chance to save your precious bank. 
We are going to play a game. If you win,  

119
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,840
the bank will be saved. If you lose... the 
bank will be destroyed! Do you like my idea?  

120
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,520
I think it's great! It means that the fate 
of the bank, your bank, is in your own hands.

121
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,840
So, Henry, my friend... are you ready to play?
 
 

122
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
CHAPTER FOUR

123
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
Don't Call the Police!

124
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,440
It was very noisy in the bank. Clients were 
arriving and the staff had to tell them that  

125
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,000
there was a problem with the computers. Some 
clients left immediately, some were angry and  

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,680
began to shout, others wanted to see the manager. 
But Mr Williams had no time to speak to anyone.  

127
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,160
He had a problem too. A big problem. Two members 
of his staff had moved the server to his office.  

128
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
It was much quieter in there and he could 
think without anyone disturbing him.

129
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,200
Belinda was sitting next to 
him. She was beginning to panic  

130
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,760
and when she felt like that 
she couldn't stop talking.

131
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
"What a horrible man. I'm sure it's a man.  

132
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,320
He's so evil. What are you going to do, 
Mr Williams? What a terrible situation!  

133
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,400
I want to help you but I just don't know what 
to do. Shall we call the police? I'm sure..."

134
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,880
Mr Williams couldn't concentrate. His 
secretary was talking faster and faster.

135
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,880
"Belinda, why don't you go and 
make me a nice cup of tea?"

136
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,920
Belinda smiled brightly 
and went out of the office.  

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
A nice cup of tea was the solution 
to all problems in her opinion.

138
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,480
So, undisturbed, Mr Williams was able to 
read the final part of the mysterious e-mail.

139
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,600
This is the game: I will send you three puzzles,  

140
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,880
one at a time. You must solve 
these puzzles in just 24 hours.

141
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,000
That's plenty of time for an intelligent man 
like you, Henry. You'll probably need to be a  

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,680
computer expert to solve them, but you use 
computers every day, don't you? (Ha! ha!)  

143
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,080
If you fail to solve all three puzzles, I 
will empty every bank account in your bank  

144
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,600
from the smallest to the largest. all the money 
will disappear and your bank will be destroyed.

145
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,960
One final thing - DON'T call the 
police. That would be very stupid.  

146
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
If you call the police, I will know.

147
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,240
Remember that I can destroy your bank 
in a few seconds. Don't risk it, Henry.

148
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,880
Do you think this is all a joke? I want 
to show you that I am very serious.  

149
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,840
Henry, do you know how much money you 
have in your bank account? Are you sure?

150
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Why don't you check? I think you'll be surprised!

151
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,480
Now I am going to give your staff access to the 
computers so the bank can function as normal.  

152
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
You see, I'm not so evil,  

153
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,560
but remember that I can switch off the 
computers or change anything at any time.

154
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,240
Bye for now, but don't worry... I'll be back soon.

155
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,720
Mr Williams sat back in his chair. He had a 
bad headache. Things were not improving. He was  

156
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,840
thinking about what to do when he heard shouts 
of joy coming from the bank staff downstairs.  

157
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,840
The door opened and Belinda came in with the tea.  

158
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,840
"The computers are working again, 
Mr Williams. Isn't that wonderful?  

159
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,320
Everything is back to normal. 
Maybe the e-mail was just a joke."

160
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,120
"Well, we'll know in a moment, Belinda," 
he replied. There were two things that  

161
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Mr Williams could do on a computer - use 
e-mail and access his own bank account.  

162
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,040
Why did the mystery hacker tell him to check 
his account? He put in his password and then his  

163
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,720
account number and waited. After a few seconds the 
information he wanted appeared on the screen...
 
 

164
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
CHAPTER FIVE

165
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
Puzzle Number One

166
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,280
Mr Williams stared at the 
computer screen, horrified.  

167
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,440
His hank account was empty! The 
bank manager quickly closed the page  

168
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,360
but Belinda had already seen it. She 
dropped her cup of tea and began to cry.  

169
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,840
Before Henry Williams could say a word, 
another message appeared on the screen.

170
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
E-mail arriving for Henry 
Williams Puzzle Number One

171
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,080
Mr Williams clicked to open the 
message and looked at the first puzzle.  

172
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,760
There were just a few words and lots 
of strange symbols and abbreviations.

173
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
It's 9.15 and time to play!

174
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
WU Henry? I C that UR : - ( Y?

175
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,000

176
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,280

177
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,240
TAFN I'll BBL

178
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
EOM HAND (LOL)

179
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
Henry, do you like the first puzzle?  

180
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,520
Isn't it cool? Cool and wicked. The clock has 
started to tick. Hurry, hurry, hurry! BFN :-)

181
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,440
Mr Williams didn't understand anything.  

182
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,200
He looked at Belinda, who was still crying. 
"Belinda, please, stop crying for just one minute  

183
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,920
and call Mike. Tell him to come 
here at once. We need his help."

184
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,800
She looked at him in amazement and replied,  

185
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,840
"But Mr Williams, you sacked Mike 
about an hour ago. Don't you remember?"

186
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,720
Yes, now he did remember. 
There was no one to help him.

187
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,320
His headache was getting worse. He couldn't think. 
Then Belinda's voice came from behind his chair.  

188
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,760
"Why don't you call your son, Robbie? 
He's very good with computers, isn't he?"

189
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,440
Mr Williams got up and hugged her. "Yes! Belinda, 
you're fantastic. Why didn't I think of that?"  

190
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,960
It was a school holiday so Robbie would be in his 
bedroom, playing on the computer and listening  

191
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,160
to music but definitely not studying. It was 
rare to see an open textbook in that bedroom.  

192
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,000
There were two things Mr Williams always 
associated with his son - his mobile phone  

193
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,120
and his baseball cap. Mr Williams picked 
up the phone and dialled his home number.

194
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,520
"Robbie? This is your father. Listen, I have 
a problem with the computers at the bank.  

195
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,560
Can you come and help me? I don't care if you're 
fighting Lara Croft. This is really important.  

196
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,400
Come as soon as possible please. Thank you."

197
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,280
Mr Williams put down the phone and smiled. "That 
was a great idea of yours, Belinda. Robbie's  

198
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,080
a teenager so I'm sure he'll understand all the 
strange symbols and abbreviations in the puzzle."

199
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,280
Belinda blushed. "If I could make 
another suggestion, Mr Williams?  

200
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,680
I think you can see where the e-mail 
came from. Look at the top of the page."

201
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,680
She was right. "Well done again, Belinda!  

202
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,640
It was sent from the local library. So, our 
mystery hacker thinks he's clever, does he?"

203
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Mr Williams picked up the phone again. 
This time he called the security office.

204
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,440
He explained the situation and 
told the head of security to  

205
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
send two guards to the library 
to find and arrest the hacker.

206
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
He was feeling a little bit better 
and Belinda had stopped crying.  

207
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,720
Then he noticed something appear on the computer 
screen. It was a clock icon and an hourglass.  

208
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,840
Fifteen minutes had already 
passed and the sand was falling.

209
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
The countdown had begun...
 
 

210
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,000
CHAPTER SIX

211
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Trouble in the Library

212
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,840
It was only 9.30 but there were already a lot of 
people inside the library; some were looking for  

213
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,560
a bestseller on the bookshelves, others were 
reading the newspapers or books in the study  

214
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,800
area and a few were using the photocopying machine 
and the computers. A man was reading the messages  

215
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,440
on a big notice-board. A mother and her child 
were going upstairs to the children's section.

216
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,400
A librarian was pushing a trolley 
of books. It was very quiet.

217
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,160
In the library anyone who had to speak,  

218
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,880
spoke quietly. The librarians were 
there to help anyone who had a problem.

219
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,080
This was the scene when Bill and Ben, 
the two security guards from the bank,  

220
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,840
arrived to investigate. They walked to the 
desk where a librarian was helping an old lady.

221
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,760
"We believe that a criminal has sent an 
e-mail message from a computer in this library  

222
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,240
and we want to see the list of people who have 
used the Internet this morning," said Bill.

223
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
The librarian calmly replied, "I'm sorry 
but I'm busy now. If you would like to wait,  

224
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
I'll be happy to help you as soon as I can."

225
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,600
Ben was not a patient man. "I 
don't think you understand, madam.  

226
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,720
We are here to arrest a criminal and 
we want to do it now!" he shouted.

227
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,080
The old lady, who was in front of Ben, was angry 
and she hit both guards with her handbag. "Hey,  

228
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,400
I was here first! You are very rude men!" she 
said. The librarian tried to calm everyone down.  

229
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,840
She said to the men, "Please don't shout. This is 
a library. I'm afraid we can only give information  

230
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,960
about the people who use our library to the 
police. Are you policemen?" Bill replied,  

231
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,160
"No, we're security guards from 
the bank on London Road and we..."

232
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,840
The librarian interrupted him, 
"Then I can't help you. Now,  

233
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,960
will you please leave the library?" But 
the men didn't want to leave. Bill had an  

234
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,400
idea. "Hey, Ben, maybe the hacker is still 
using the computer. Let's go and see."

235
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
They ran to the computer area and began to 
question the four people who were using the  

236
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,320
computers. Now everyone in the library, 
including the librarians, came to watch.

237
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
The guards were shouting and the people 
at the computers were frightened.

238
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,400
Mr Page, the head librarian, 
came out of his office  

239
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,800
to see why there was all this noise in 
his usually quiet library. The scene  

240
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,440
he saw shocked him. He walked to the computer 
area and demanded to know what was happening.

241
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,000
About twenty people answered him at 
the same time so it was impossible  

242
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,120
to understand. But he soon realized that 
the two men dressed in blue uniforms  

243
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
were causing the problem and 
were disturbing everyone.

244
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,040
He shouted, "You two, get out of my library now!" 
And with the help of some people in the library,  

245
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,480
he pushed them to the door and then 
out of the library and into the street.

246
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,320
"And don't come back!" yelled 
the old lady, furiously.  

247
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,320
All the people in the library were 
talking about what had just happened.

248
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:07,920
Nobody noticed a man who was hiding 
behind the shelves. He was laughing...
 
 

249
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
CHAPTER SEVEN

250
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,560
Robbie the Hero

251
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,000
- Robbie Williams arrived at the bank a 
few minutes after the phone conversation  

252
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,680
with his father. He wasn't very happy. It 
was the school holidays and he wanted to go  

253
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,120
out with his friends but his mother told him 
at least ten times a day to open a textbook  

254
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,560
and study. Today he had wanted to buy a 
new football scarf and a computer game but  

255
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,960
instead he had to help his father at the bank! 
He went inside and up the stairs to the office.

256
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,360
"Hey, Dad, what's up? I have to meet my 
friends at the shopping centre at lunchtime.  

257
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm going to buy a new computer game. It's wicked.  

258
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,680
It's called..." Mr Williams interrupted his 
son. "Robbie, please, take those headphones  

259
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,000
off and listen to me." He quickly explained the 
problem of the hacker. Robbie couldn't believe it.

260
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
"Bad luck, Dad. How can I help?"

261
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,320
Mr Williams showed him the first puzzle. 
Robbie gave his father a big smile.

262
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,880
"Relax, Dad. This is so easy I can do it with 
my eyes shut! I use these abbreviations every  

263
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,960
day when I'm in a chat room or when 
I text my friends on my mobile phone.  

264
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:25,760
I'll show you. WU stands for 'What's up?' 
I C stands for 'I see.' And these symbols  

265
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,720
are called 'emoticons.' They look like a face and 
they express the way you feel. I can easily decode  

266
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,600
this message for you." Robbie sat down, clicked 
on the reply icon and wrote out the message:

267
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,880
What's up Henry? I see you are 
sad. Why? You can't see me.  

268
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,840
You are sad but I am angry. In my opinion you 
are surprised or perhaps afraid. That's all for  

269
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:04,160
now. I'll be back later. End Of Message Have 
a nice day (laughing out loud) Bye for now!

270
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,520
"See? I told you it was easy. Now I'll click 
on 'Send' and the message will go back to  

271
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:20,800
the sender." Mr Williams thanked his son and 
slowly he began to relax... but for how long?

272
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,240
It was now 10.15. Only one hour had passed. 
Belinda came into the office and said to her boss,

273
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,600
"The ATM is working again..." Mr Williams smiled.  

274
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,200
"But," she added quickly, "it's giving 
the customers too much money..."

275
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,640
Mr Williams tell back into his 
chair. Why was life so difficult?

276
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,240
The security guards Bill and Ben knocked 
at the door and came into his office.  

277
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,120
Did they have some good news for him?

278
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,600
"Well?" he asked hopefully. "Did you find him?"

279
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,480
Bill answered, "Not exactly, Mr Williams.  

280
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
We tried but the people at the 
library were very unfriendly."

281
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,920
"Yes," added Ben. "They didn't 
want to help us and in the end  

282
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,560
they asked us to leave. There was an 
old lady who..." Mr Williams was angry.

283
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,880
"I'm not interested in the old lady. You 
obviously didn't catch the hacker. You  

284
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,280
are both completely incompetent. Now go 
back to your office before I sack you."

285
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,040
His headache had returned, worse than ever. Then 
his son said, "Dad, look. There's another message  

286
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:37,840
from the hacker." He looked at Robbie and then at 
Belinda. Then they all looked at the screen...
 
 

287
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
CHAPTER EIGHT

288
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
My Name is Trentine

289
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,120
Hello Henry,

290
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,160
Well, that was an easy puzzle. I imagine 
someone helped you - your son Robbie perhaps?  

291
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,800
He's intelligent but your 
security guards are really stupid.

292
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:06,800
They didn't see me at the library but I 
saw them! Never mind! Maybe they'll have  

293
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:16,080
better luck next time... Here's your second 
puzzle - impossible, I think. Have fun! BFN

294
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,920
Puzzle Number Two

295
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,600
My name is TRENTINE - I am power 
and knowledge. These are my friends:

296
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:41,840
Berrows limea rodlw ediw bew thac moro frus

297
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,960
Henry Williams wasn't very worried. 
He had his secret weapon - Robbie!

298
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,280
"You can solve this puzzle too, can't you, 
Robbie?" he asked. Then he saw his son's face.

299
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,120
"Dad, I'm really sorry but I don't understand it.  

300
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,160
But, look - the hacker sent it from 
the Internet Cafe in the city centre."

301
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Belinda was crying again. Mr Williams phoned 
the security office for the second time that day  

302
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,040
and told Bill and Ben to go to the Internet 
Cafe to find the hacker. As soon as he put  

303
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,320
down the phone, a bank teller came 
into his office with more bad news.

304
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,400
"A customer has just told me that 
the bank's website is advertising  

305
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,080
a special offer - a credit card with 
0% interest. Is it true?" he asked.

306
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,880
"Of course it isn't!" yelled Mr Williams.  

307
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
"Don't give any new credit cards to any 
of our customers! Now go back to work!"

308
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,680
The teller disappeared. The minutes became hours  

309
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,560
and Mr Williams became more and more agitated. 
Robbie continued to look at the puzzle perplexed,  

310
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,120
and Belinda continued to cry. Suddenly Robbie 
had an idea. "I know what to do!" he shouted.

311
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,800
His father jumped up. "Have you 
solved the puzzle?'" he asked.

312
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,160
"No, but I bet my friend Joe can help us. 
I'll send him a text message on his mobile."  

313
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,880
Mr Williams sat down again 
while Robbie sent the message.

314
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
Come to Bank Now. Rob

315
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,520
When Joe arrived it was already 5 o'clock.

316
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,200
"What's up, Robbie?" he asked. Then 
he saw Belinda, who smiled at him.  

317
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,320
He smiled back. Wow! She was beautiful! 
He immediately fell in love with her.

318
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,960
"Joe, listen to me," said Robbie. He explained 
about the hacker and showed Joe the second puzzle.  

319
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,680
Joe didn't want to take his eyes off Belinda 
but he had to look at the computer screen.  

320
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,480
Mr Williams was beginning to panic.

321
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,680
"Hurry, boys. There isn't much time left."

322
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,880
"Take it easy, Mr W. We can solve 
this. Come on, Robbie. Let's do it."

323
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,400
After four long hours they solved the puzzle. 
"So, who is Trentine?" asked Mr Williams.

324
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,600
"The Internet," replied Joe.

325
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,520
"Of course," said Robbie. "And the 
friends are all words connected with  

326
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,440
the Internet - browser, e-mail, 
world wide web, chat room and..."

327
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
"Surf," said Belinda happily.

328
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Joe looked at her. "Belinda, you are so cool.  

329
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,240
You're the perfect girl tor me," he 
said as he clicked on the "Send" icon.

330
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Mr Williams looked at them and said to 
himself: "What are they talking about?  

331
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,360
I think I'm getting old."

332
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,680
It was nine o'clock. The hourglass was half-empty 
but they had solved the puzzle in time.  

333
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,320
Mr Williams was very relieved. The 
situation was improving at last.  

334
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
At that moment the telephone rang.  

335
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,680
When Mr Williams answered he heard a voice 
say: "Good evening. This is the police..."
 
 

336
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
CHAPTER NINE

337
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
A Surprise for Henry

338
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:16,160
Mr Williams put down the phone. He said, "That was 
the police. It seems that Bill and Ben created a  

339
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,960
disturbance at the Internet Cafe and they have 
been arrested. They didn't catch the hacker,  

340
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,400
of course. Why doesn't that surprise me? Well, 
they can stay at the police station until we find  

341
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,000
the hacker." There was no reply from the others. 
Robbie was sending a text message on his mobile  

342
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,280
phone to his friends to say why he hadn't met 
them that afternoon. Joe was talking to Belinda.

343
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,240
"Will you go out with me tonight, Belinda?  

344
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,320
There's a great hamburger place 
near here." Belinda smiled at him.

345
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,040
"But you're only 15, Joe. I'm too old for you."

346
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,360
"I'm very mature for my age," he 
replied quickly. "Come on! We'll  

347
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,000
have a fantastic time. I'll pay and..." Their 
conversation was interrupted by the hacker.

348
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:05,360
Congratulations, Henry. You've solved the second 
Puzzle. I suppose Robbie helped you again. It's a  

349
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,760
pity those security guards aren't as intelligent 
as your son. They failed again, didn't they?  

350
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:20,800
Henry, there's still another puzzle to solve. If 
you solve it, you will discover my identity. I'll  

351
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:29,200
send the Message later. First, you need to relax 
and... cool down. Are you ready for a surprise?

352
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,880
BFN

353
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,880
"A surprise. What does that mean, 
Mr Williams'" asked Belinda.

354
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,840
"I have no idea but I'm sure we'll 
soon find out," replied her boss.

355
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,840
All the staff had gone home at 5 o'clock as usual.  

356
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,440
The offices were silent. He was suddenly 
very tired. His eyes began to close...

357
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,480
He was on holiday in the Caribbean. He was on 
the beach. It was hot and sunny. There were  

358
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,520
no clouds in the sky. It was too hot so he went 
swimming in the sea to cool down. He was wet, very  

359
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:15,280
wet... Mr Williams woke up. He was wet! Was it 
raining in his office? He heard Belinda's voice:

360
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,800
"Mr Williams, what's happening? I'm all 
wet. Where is the water coming from?  

361
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,840
My hair and clothes are ruined!"

362
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,440
Mr Williams answered, "This 
is our surprise, Belinda.  

363
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,200
Our friend the hacker has started the sprinkler 
system. Very funny. Let's get out of here."

364
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,880
They all ran out of the 
office and went downstairs.  

365
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,000
Joe tried to console Belinda, and Robbie 
wanted to know if he could go home.

366
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
"Please, Dad. It's late and 
I want to watch TV tonight."

367
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,800
"Not yet," replied his father. "We 
still have another puzzle to solve."

368
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,280
"What do you mean 'we,' Dad? You haven't done 
anything yet," replied his son sarcastically.  

369
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,760
Mr Williams looked at his son but 
he knew that Robbie was right.  

370
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,640
The boys had solved the first two puzzles.

371
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,200
In the distance they heard a siren.  

372
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Was it the police? Mr Williams and 
Robbie went to the doors of the bank.  

373
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:33,840
Slowly Mr Williams opened the door...
 
 

374
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,920
CHAPTER TEN

375
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,240
Where's the Fire?

376
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,360
Mr Williams opened the door and 
three firemen ran into the hank.

377
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,080
"OK, where's the fire?" they said. 
Mr Williams was very confused.

378
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,240
"What do you mean, 'fire'? There's no 
fire here. I think you've made a mistake."

379
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,160
The firemen were not convinced. "Mr Williams, 
have you forgotten that the bank's sprinkler  

380
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,720
system is connected to the alarm at the 
tire station? The sprinklers started,  

381
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,200
the alarm sounded and we came here to put out the 
fire. Now, where is it?" This time Robbie spoke.

382
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,760
"There is no fire. The sprinklers started 
because there must be a problem with the system."

383
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,400
"Yes," added Mr Williams. "I'm so sorry 
that you've come here for nothing."

384
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,240
"Well, I must say I can't see any fire.  

385
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,520
We'll come back tomorrow morning to check if 
there's some kind of problem with the sprinklers,"  

386
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,640
the fireman replied. "You're working very 
late tonight, Mr Williams," he added.

387
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,480
"Yes, we have a lot to do,"  

388
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,600
came the tired reply. When they had gone, Mr 
Williams told Belinda that she could go home.  

389
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,760
He opened the door for her and Robbie tried to go 
out at the same time. His father pulled him back.

390
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,960
"I need you here," he said. 
"Let's go back to the office."

391
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,840
"Oh, Dad," Robbie protested but 
he followed his father upstairs.

392
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,840
It was four o'clock in the morning 
when the final puzzle arrived.  

393
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,880
Robbie and Joe were sleeping on 
the floor. They had been too tired  

394
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,200
to stay awake. Henry Williams forced 
himself to look at the computer screen.

395
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,120
Hi, Henry. Here's the final puzzle.

396
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,600
You have to read these sentences about 
a famous person and find the four words.

397
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,080
Puzzle Number Three

398
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:36,080
The first word is his first but it's your second. 
The second word is a barrier but also a way to  

399
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:44,720
enter. The third word is the baby, or is it a 
monster? The fourth word is where it all began.

400
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,160
Now take the first letter of each 
word, then add the letters I and A.  

401
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,400
You now have six letters and in 
these letters you will find my name.

402
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,160
BFN

403
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,240
It was incredible. A few hours ago everything was 
fine. Now someone wanted to destroy his bank and  

404
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:17,440
his life. Why? He touched Robbie gently and said, 
"Robbie, wake up! The last puzzle has arrived.  

405
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,000
We've only got a few hours to solve 
it." There was no response from his son,  

406
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,240
who continued to sleep. Mr Williams tried to 
wake Joe, but Joe simply mumbled in his sleep,  

407
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,720
"Belinda, do you want a hamburger or a 
cheeseburger?" Mr Williams sat with his  

408
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:44,160
head in his hands. The boys were sleeping and he 
couldn't wake them. What was he going to do? He  

409
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,840
looked at the clock again - it was already 
four thirty! Then another e-mail arrived.

410
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,640
Come on, Henry. Admit it. You've lost.

411
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,120
Soon I will start to empty the bank accounts. Who 
shall I choose first? Perhaps the police station?  

412
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,720
OR maybe I'll choose Mrs Miller, 
the poor old lady from the library.  

413
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,600
No, I think I'll start with the Town Council - 
it's the end of the month and wages must be paid.

414
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:31,840
Was the hacker right? Was this the end...?
 
 

415
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,920
CHAPTER ELEVEN

416
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,720
Is It the End?

417
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,080
At 8.30 Mr Williams opened his eyes. For a moment 
he didn't remember the events of the previous day.  

418
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
Then slowly his mind formed a 
picture of a computer hacker  

419
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,080
and some strange puzzles. He wondered if he 
had dreamt it all. Then he saw Robbie and Joe,  

420
00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:00,000
who were still asleep on the floor and he saw the 
computer screen. The final puzzle was still there  

421
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,080
and the hourglass was almost empty. 
It wasn't a nightmare; it was real!

422
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,000
The door of the office opened and Belinda came in. 
"Oh, Mr Williams. Have you been here all night?  

423
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,600
And poor Robbie and Joe too. Did you 
find the solution to the last puzzle?"

424
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,240
She saw his expression and 
already knew the answer.  

425
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,920
"I'll make you a nice cup of tea and 
you'll soon feel better," she said.

426
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,120
There were only thirty minutes left. Mr 
Williams was angry with himself. He felt  

427
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,240
responsible for everything. His bank was in 
danger and he couldn't save it. He tried to  

428
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,840
wake Robbie again but it was difficult 
to wake his teenage son before midday!  

429
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Belinda returned with the tea. 
Mr Williams drank three cups.

430
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,960
He looked out of his window. The bank teller were 
arriving for another day's work - maybe the last  

431
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,960
day. What could he tell them? In desperation 
he sat down in front of the computer again.  

432
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,360
"Belinda, if we win, I promise that I will 
learn about computers and become an expert.  

433
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,040
My son is only 15 and he knows much more than 
me. I'm living in the past and I have to change."

434
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,520
"That's a wonderful idea, 
Mr Williams. And of course,  

435
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll help you as much as possible. 
I know a lot of things now and..."

436
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,560
She didn't finish her sentence because Mr 
Williams shouted so loudly that Robbie and Joe  

437
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,000
woke up. "That's it! I've found the 
solution! I know the answer to the puzzle!"

438
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,880
Robbie and Joe got up right 
away. They looked at one another  

439
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,840
and then at Mr Williams. Robbie said hesitantly, 
"Are you sure Dad? It looks impossible to me."

440
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,880
"Yes, of course I'm sure. I've done it. Now, first 
I click on the reply icon, right? And then I write  

441
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,760
the answers. The first word is Bill - it's the 
man's first name and the abbreviation of my  

442
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,480
second name, Williams. The second word is 
gate. It's a barrier and a way to enter."

443
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,080
"So the man is Bill Gates," said Joe.

444
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:17,520
"Exactly," replied Mr Williams. "The third 
word is Microsoft - his baby, his creation,  

445
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,240
but also a monster in the opinion 
of some people. And the last word is  

446
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:30,160
Seattle. That's where Bill Gates lives and 
where he started Microsoft, the beginning."

447
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,560
"That's brilliant Dad. Well done!" said Robbie.

448
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:43,200
"Now," continued Mr Williams, "if we take the 
first letter of each word we have B, G, M, and S.  

449
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,200
We have to add two more letters 
- I and A - and these six letters  

450
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,000
should spell the name of the hacker." 
Everyone looked at the six letters:

451
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,840
B G M S I A

452
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,160
They tried to see a name but they could only 
see words like big and bags but no names.  

453
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:15,840
Then suddenly Mr Williams jumped up and yelled, 
"Yes! Yes! I know the name of the hacker..."
 
 

454
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,800
CHAPTER TWELVE
A Holiday for Someone

455
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,280
"Sam Gib," said Mr Williams. "I don't 
believe it. But why does he hate me?"

456
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,560
"Maybe because you sacked him two weeks ago," 
suggested Belinda. Robbie asked, "Who's Sam  

457
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,880
Gib?" Mr Williams explained, "He used to work here 
at the bank. In the beginning he was a good bank  

458
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,960
teller. Then he started to arrive late for work 
every day. Instead of working he used to surf  

459
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,880
the net and log on to chat rooms. He spent hours 
talking to people all over the world. So I sacked  

460
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:04,080
him. But wait a minute. If he left two weeks 
ago, how did he know the new computer passwords?"

461
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,320
Belinda had the answer to his question.

462
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,600
"He came back to the bank a few days ago 
to empty his desk. I think you were in a  

463
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,640
meeting. I remember that he went to Mike's 
office and stayed there for a long time.  

464
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,280
I thought he was talking to Mike, but now I 
think about it Mike wasn't there all the time.  

465
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,560
Anyway, Mr Williams, you're a 
hero. You've saved the bank!"

466
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,400
"Yes, and there are only two minutes 
left. Look, it's 9.13," said Joe.

467
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,440
They all looked at the computer screen. 
Suddenly Robbie said, "Dad, did you remember  

468
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,800
to click on the 'send' icon to return the 
message to the hacker, I mean, Sam Gib?"

469
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,440
"Oh, no! Quickly, click, 
CLICK before it's too late!"  

470
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,320
shouted Mr Williams. Four hands tried to 
operate the mouse but in the confusion  

471
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,120
it fell on the floor. Finally Robbie picked up 
the mouse, clicked and the message disappeared.  

472
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,200
For a moment nobody spoke. Then they all 
began laughing and hugging each another.

473
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:10,880
"We've won! We've won, you've won, Dad," said 
Robbie while Joe hugged Belinda again. Mr Williams  

474
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,360
went downstairs to give the good news to the 
staff, who also laughed and applauded their boss.  

475
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,360
When Mr Williams returned to his 
office he picked up the phone.

476
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,640
"Now I can call the police and tell 
them everything and they can go to  

477
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:35,840
Sam's house and arrest him." But before 
he could do it, another e-mail arrived.

478
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,640
Hello Henry

479
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,040
Now you know who I am. Congratulations!

480
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,480
Did you enjoy playing my game?

481
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,560
When you sacked me I wanted my 
revenge so I sent the virus that  

482
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:57,600
infected the bank's computers. But it wasn't 
enough. You installed a new computer system  

483
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:04,480
so I came to visit Mike and saw the new 
passwords on his desk. It was so easy.  

484
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,600
You really need to improve security 
at the bank. Maybe I can help you?

485
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,240
But Henry, I still have a surprise for you...

486
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,600
This time Mr Williams went white.

487
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,680
"Oh please no! Not another puzzle!" he cried.

488
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,720
I think I need a holiday. As you booked 
your holiday to the Caribbean on the net,  

489
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,200
I changed the address and the tickets arrived 
at my house instead of your house yesterday.  

490
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,960
I also changed the date of 
the holiday and I'm leaving at  

491
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,800
10.00 today. I'm sending this message 
from the airport on my new laptop.  

492
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,920
To show you that I am a kind person, I have 
returned all the money to your bank account.

493
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,000
Thanks for the holiday. Maybe we can play 
another game when I come back...
 
 
 
 

494
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,542
- THE END -
