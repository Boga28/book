00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:06,359
CHAPTER ONE
The Three Friends

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,520
One of the pages of Longridge's note to Mrs.
Oakes flew into the air.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,850
It sailed across the room and landed on the
fire.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,020
The journey took place in Canada, in the northwest
of Ontario.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,470
This part of the country is wild, with woods,
lakes, and fast rivers.

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,680
There are thousands of kilometers of narrow
country roads, a few small towns, and lonely

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,950
farms.

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:47,860
Men from the big paper companies cut down
trees deep in the forests.

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,260
There are Indians and hunters.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:57,950
But most of the time there are no human beings,
only wild animals.

11
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,059
And silence.

12
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:08,170
For almost half the year the area is covered
in snow, and the temperature falls below zero

13
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,370
for weeks.

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,690
The seasons are different in north Ontario.

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,729
The plants and flowers do not grow slowly
in spring.

16
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:26,909
There is a sudden, short summer when everything
grows fast.

17
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,780
Then it is fall again with clear blue skies,
sunny days, and wonderful, richly colored

18
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,189
leaves on the trees: gold and yellow and red.

19
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:48,100
Through this wild, lonely country, in the
fall, the three travelers made their incredible

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,710
journey.

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:02:00,850
John Longridge lived alone a long way from
one of the small towns, in an old stone house

22
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,049
that belonged to his family.

23
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,269
He was a tall man of about forty, serious
but kind.

24
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,700
He was a writer of history books and traveled
a lot.

25
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,239
But he always returned to the comfortable
old stone house to write his books.

26
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,849
Mrs. Oakes and her husband Bert lived about
a kilometer away.

27
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,769
Mrs. Oakes went to Longridge's home every
day.

28
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,750
She looked after the house and cooked his
main meals.

29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,109
Bert looked after the backyard.

30
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,540
They understood Longridge very well.

31
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,809
While he was writing, they worked quietly
around the place.

32
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:57,319
On the evening before the incredible journey,
toward the end of September, Longridge was

33
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,510
reading a newspaper by a warm wood fire in
his comfortable library.

34
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:09,650
He couldn't turn the pages easily because
a Siamese cat with bright blue eyes was sitting

35
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,109
on his knees.

36
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:22,189
From time to time, the cat moved his brown
front paws as he looked into the fire.

37
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:30,069
On the floor, with his head on one of Longridge
s feet, lay an old white bull terrier.

38
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:36,729
His eyes were closed and his tail moved in
his sleep.

39
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,980
Some people think bull terriers are strange,
ugly dogs.

40
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:50,489
But Longridge loved him: he was a friendly
family pet and, at the same time, a strong,

41
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,609
brave fighter.

42
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:59,469
The man always enjoyed the look of happiness
in the old dog s little eyes.

43
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:04,779
By the door lay another dog with his nose
on his paws.

44
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:13,230
This was a large red-gold Labrador retriever,
a young dog with a strong body.

45
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,769
His brown eyes were wide open, watching everything.

46
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:26,810
When Longridge got up from his chair, the
dog lifted his proud head.

47
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:34,940
Longridge put the cat on the floor and carefully
moved his foot from under the old dog's head.

48
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,379
He walked across the room and looked out the
window.

49
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:46,620
A huge orange moon was coming up just above
the trees at the far end of the yard.

50
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,290
It was bright outside from the light of the
moon.

51
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,590
Longridge could see the leaves on the grass.

52
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,120
There were a few colorful flowers, still there
from the summer.

53
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,620
He turned, crossed the room, and turned on
another light.

54
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,370
Next he opened a narrow cupboard halfway up
the wall.

55
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,150
Inside were a lot of guns.

56
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,280
He took one out and looked at it carefully.

57
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,760
The Labrador sat up when he saw the gun.

58
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,569
He looked at it with excitement and great
interest.

59
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:33,979
When Longridge put the gun back in the cupboard,
the young dog lay down again.

60
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,810
He turned his head away, his eyes unhappy.

61
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:46,450
Suddenly, the telephone rang and broke the
silence of the quiet room.

62
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,580
Woken by the noise, the cat jumped angrily
off the chair.

63
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,539
The old bull terrier struggled to his feet.

64
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,410
Longridge answered the phone.

65
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,909
He could hear Mrs. Oakes, but her voice was
not very clear.

66
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,349
"Speak louder, Mrs. Oakes," he said.

67
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,730
"I can't hear you."

68
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:17,599
"I can't hear you very well either," said
Mrs. Oakes.

69
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,020
"Is that better?

70
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm shouting now!

71
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,879
What time are you leaving in the morning,
Mr. Longridge?

72
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,400
Excuse me?

73
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Could you talk louder, please?"

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,129
"About seven o'clock.

75
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:43,590
I want to get to Heron Lake before dark,"
he shouted.

76
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,389
"But you don't have to be here at that time,
Mrs. Oakes."

77
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,909
"What did you say?

78
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:51,909
Seven?

79
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:57,870
Will it be all right if I come at about nine?

80
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,249
My daughter's arriving on the early bus and
I'd like to meet her.

81
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,910
But I don't want to leave the dogs alone too
long..."

82
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,030
"Of course you must meet her," John shouted.

83
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,389
"The dogs will be fine.

84
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:21,029
I'll take them out before I leave and..."

85
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:24,789
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Longridge.

86
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:30,800
I'll be there at about nine, I promise.

87
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,680
What did you say about the animals?

88
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,220
Don't worry about them.

89
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,770
Bert and I will..."

90
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,139
But Longridge couldn't hear her.

91
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:48,069
He put down the phone, walked over to the
outside door, and opened it wide.

92
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,710
The three animals followed him and ran out
into the cold night air.

93
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,699
Longridge stood at the door, quietly smoking
his pipe.

94
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,759
The animals did the same thing every night.

95
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:07,330
For the first few minutes they stayed in the
yard, then they all ran into the fields.

96
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:14,990
As they disappeared into the darkness (the
old bull terrier far behind the other two),

97
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,939
Longridge turned back into the house.

98
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:27,400
Longridge and his brother owned a cabin on
Heron Lake, over three hundred kilometers

99
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,790
away.

100
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:35,539
Twice a year they went there together for
two or three weeks to fish and hunt.

101
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,300
Mrs. Oakes and Bert looked after the house
and the three animals while Longridge was

102
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,209
away on vacation.

103
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:50,589
Bert worked in the yard, so the animals could
be outside most of the time.

104
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:56,380
Mrs. Oakes fed them while she was working
in the house.

105
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,240
Longridge finished packing and went into the
library.

106
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,430
He sat down and wrote a note.

107
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:10,660
Dear Mrs. Oakes, he wrote, I've taken some
coffee and sugar with me.

108
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,810
Please buy some more.

109
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,690
I will take the dogs (and the cat too, of
course!)...

110
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,769
Here he came to the end of the small square
of paper.

111
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,589
He took another piece and continued:

112
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,329
... out for a run before I leave.

113
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,040
I will give them something to eat, too.

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,160
Don't worry about them.

115
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,050
I know they will be fine with you and Bert.

116
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:47,510
He left the note on the desk, then opened
the outside door.

117
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,720
The old dog and the cat hurried in to greet
him.

118
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,530
They brought the fresh smell of the fields
with them.

119
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,220
The young dog followed behind, walking calmly.

120
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,279
The old dog wagged his tail against Longridge's
legs.

121
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,390
The cat pressed against him, too.

122
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:14,750
He moved his tail politely from side to side
when the man softly touched him.

123
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,899
The Labrador stood near them and watched quietly.

124
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,720
The cat then walked into the library to lie
down in front of the warm fire.

125
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,100
Every night he lay there first, and later
moved upstairs to Longridge's bed.

126
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:42,269
The cat could go everywhere in the house because
he could open all the doors himself!

127
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,910
The young dog walked over to his bed on the
kitchen floor, and the bull terrier started

128
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,399
climbing up the stairs to Longridge's bedroom.

129
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,190
Longridge followed him, undressed, and got
into bed.

130
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,320
But he couldn't sleep.

131
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,770
He lay awake and thought about his trip the
next day, and about the animals.

132
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,550
He was unhappy about the sad look in the young
dog's eyes.

133
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,330
He really didn't want to leave them all alone
when he went away.

134
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:25,660
The three strange, lovable animals belonged
to the family of an old and dear college friend.

135
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:33,579
This friend, Jim Hunter, was a professor of
English in a small college about four hundred

136
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,709
kilometers away.

137
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:43,790
Longridge often stayed with him, his wife,
and their two children, Elizabeth and Peter.

138
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:51,660
When the professor was invited to teach at
a college in England for nine months, Elizabeth

139
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,660
and Peter wanted to go with their parents.

140
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,009
But they couldn't take their pets.

141
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:04,149
Longridge could see that the children were
very unhappy about the animals.

142
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:07,910
He loved Elizabeth and Peter and he could
understand their feelings.

143
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:16,760
The cat, Tao, belonged to nine-year-old Elizabeth.

144
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:25,459
She looked after him, fed him, took him for
walks, and he slept at the bottom of her bed.

145
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:33,170
Eleven-year-old Peter couldn't remember a
day in his life without Bodger, the terrier,

146
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,500
a gift to him on his first birthday.

147
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,779
The Labrador, Luath, belonged to their father.

148
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:50,540
The young dog often went hunting with his
master.

149
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,860
Longridge sat and watched the family.

150
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,230
Everybody was very quiet, thinking about the
animals.

151
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,649
Then he suddenly heard a voice, his own voice!

152
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,540
"Don't worry," the voice said.

153
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,319
"I'll look after the animals while you're
in England.

154
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,870
I know them well already.

155
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,980
And I've got a big house and a large yard.

156
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,810
Mrs. Oakes will love them.

157
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,820
Everything will be wonderful!

158
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,949
Before you leave for England, you can bring
them to me.

159
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,920
You can see where they'll sleep.

160
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,910
And you can give me a list of things that
they like to eat.

161
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,350
I'll look after them until you come back."

162
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:49,110
So one day the Hunter family drove to Longridge's
house and left their three pets.

163
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,050
Elizabeth cried when she had to say goodbye
to Tao.

164
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,850
Peter gave Longridge a long list of Bodger's
needs.

165
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:07,300
During the first few days the animals looked
unhappy and Longridge was worried about them.

166
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:15,600
But soon, with the help of Mrs. Oakes's delicious
food, the old terrier and the cat seemed happy

167
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,899
and comfortable.

168
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,720
They started to love their new master.

169
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,579
Then Bodger started disappearing in the afternoons.

170
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,040
Longridge didn't know where he went.

171
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,940
Finally, one day, he saw the terrier in the
school playground.

172
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:43,000
The dog walked over the fields every afternoon
to play with the school children!

173
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,810
But the young Labrador, Luath, was very different.

174
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:57,329
He ate well and looked healthy, but he never
stopped missing his home and master.

175
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,769
He didn't come close to Longridge like the
other two, and he seemed nervous.

176
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:09,339
He was always listening and waiting for something
far away.

177
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,070
Longridge felt sorry for Luath and worried
about him.

178
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,879
Longridge fell asleep at last.

179
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:24,699
Downstairs the dreaming, curious moon shone
through the window and woke the cat.

180
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:34,570
He got up, his huge blue eyes wide open, sat
near the window, and looked out at the yard.

181
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,259
Only his tail moved.

182
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:41,740
Then he turned and jumped onto the desk.

183
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,300
One of the pages of Longridge's note to Mrs.
Oakes flew into the air.

184
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,819
It sailed across the room and landed on the
fire.

185
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:57,029
As it slowly burned, the writing disappeared.

186
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,940
The pale light from the moon reached the young
dog in the kitchen.

187
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,310
He moved uncomfortably in his sleep, then
sat up.

188
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,050
He was listening for a sound that never came:
his master's voice.

189
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,620
Finally, the moon lit the upstairs bedroom.

190
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:23,940
There Longridge lay asleep in his bed with
the old bull terrier, warm and happy, against

191
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:30,250
his back.

192
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:36,480
CHAPTER TWO
The Journey Begins

193
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:44,380
She thought that the animals were traveling
north, on vacation with Longridge...

194
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:54,819
She had no idea that they were now on a lonely
country road, going west.

195
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,069
Longridge got up early the next morning.

196
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:02,180
The sun was already shining over the fields
and through the bedroom window.

197
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,330
It was the beginning of a perfect, warm fall
day.

198
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,830
He shaved and dressed quickly, and then went
downstairs.

199
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:19,700
The animals were waiting patiently by the
outside door for their early morning run.

200
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,950
He let them out, then cooked and ate his breakfast.

201
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,830
He was putting his bags in the car when the
dogs and the cat returned from the fields.

202
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,430
He gave them some cookies and they lay by
the wall of the house in the sun.

203
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,880
They watched him as he put his guns and hunting
equipment into the back of the car.

204
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,360
When it was time to leave, he crossed the
yard to the animals.

205
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,300
He said goodbye to each of them.

206
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,080
"Be good.

207
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,140
Mrs. Oakes will be here soon.

208
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,660
Goodbye, Luath," he said to the Labrador retriever.

209
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,530
"I know you want to come with me.

210
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,770
I'd like to take you, but I can't.

211
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,180
Our boat is too small for three of us."

212
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,670
As he spoke, he put his hand on the young
dog's soft face.

213
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,520
The golden- brown eyes looked into his, and
then the dog did an unusual thing.

214
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,340
He lifted his right paw and placed it in the
man's hand!

215
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,350
Longridge was surprised at the dog's friendliness.

216
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,620
"Thank you, Luath," he said.

217
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,520
"You're a good friend."

218
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,110
He looked at his watch.

219
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,840
"I have to go now," he said to the animals.

220
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,070
"I'm already late."

221
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,990
He wasn't worried about leaving them alone
in the yard.

222
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,130
They never went far without him.

223
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,960
And when they wanted to get back into the
house, they could push the door open.

224
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,790
They all looked happy in the sun, too.

225
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,080
The cat was washing carefully behind his ears.

226
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,950
The old dog was resting after his early morning
run, with his long pink tongue hanging out

227
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,600
of his smiling mouth.

228
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:26,550
And the Labrador lay quietly by the terrier's
side.

229
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:32,290
Longridge started the car, waved to the animals
through the window, and drove slowly down

230
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,430
the road.

231
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,970
He smiled to himself, feeling stupid.

232
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,820
"What do I want them to do?" he laughed.

233
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,650
"Wave to me?

234
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,140
Or shout 'Goodbye'?

235
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,940
I've lived alone too long, and I'm beginning
to love them too much."

236
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,230
The car turned a corner and disappeared.

237
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:04,030
The cat started washing one of his back legs;
the old dog lay down and went to sleep.

238
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:15,140
The young dog stayed near him; only his eyes
moved, and his nose from time to time.

239
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,900
Twenty minutes passed.

240
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,230
Then suddenly, the young dog got up and looked
hard down the road.

241
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,210
He stayed like this for a long time.

242
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,830
The cat watched him closely, with one leg
up in the air.

243
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:39,260
Then the Labrador started to walk slowly down
the road.

244
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,600
After a few seconds he stopped, turned, and
looked back at the others.

245
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,390
He was inviting them to follow.

246
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,620
The old dog struggled up to his feet and joined
him.

247
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,280
Together they turned the corner of the road
and disappeared from the cat's view.

248
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,240
He stayed by the house for a minute, blue
eyes shining in his dark face.

249
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,820
Then, with a curious run, he started to follow
the two dogs.

250
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,380
They were waiting by the gate when he turned
the corner.

251
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,210
When the cat reached them, the Labrador continued
up the road.

252
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,720
But the old terrier didn't move.

253
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,310
He looked back, hoping to see Mrs. Oakes with
some delicious food.

254
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,050
And the cat stood next to him, with one paw
in the air.

255
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,900
He didn't know what to do.

256
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,800
Then suddenly, they both decided to follow
Luath.

257
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:52,080
Soon all three disappeared down the road,
walking quickly and with purpose.

258
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:00,050
About an hour later, Mrs. Oakes walked up
the road.

259
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:06,150
She was carrying a bag with her working clothes
and some special food for the animals.

260
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,340
"That's strange," she thought.

261
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,841
"Where are the dogs?

262
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:14,100
They usually run up to say hello.

263
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,880
Maybe Mr. Longridge left them inside the house."

264
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:26,320
But when she pushed open the kitchen door,
there was complete silence.

265
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,700
She stood at the bottom of the stairs and
called the animals.

266
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,610
Nothing happened.

267
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:38,470
Then she walked through the quiet house and
out into the front yard.

268
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,740
She called again, but they didn't come.

269
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:51,880
"Maybe they've gone up to the school," she
said to herself in the empty, sunny yard.

270
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,210
She went back into the kitchen and sat down.

271
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,700
"It's funny that Tao isn't here, though,"
she thought as she put on her work shoes.

272
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,930
"He usually sits near the window at this time
of day.

273
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,230
Maybe he's out hunting again."

274
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,590
She washed and put away some dishes.

275
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,550
Then she went into the living room.

276
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,620
On the desk she saw Longridge's note.

277
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,230
She read the first page.

278
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,270
Then she looked for a second piece of paper
but couldn't find one.

279
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,820
"That's strange," she thought.

280
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,230
"Where has Mr. Longridge taken them?

281
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,950
The second page of the note must be here somewhere."

282
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,550
But when she searched the room, she couldn't
find anything.

283
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:51,410
Then, when she was cleaning the fireplace,
she noticed a burnt piece of paper.

284
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:57,380
She picked it up carefully, but there was
no writing on it now.

285
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,950
"That's very strange," she said to herself
while she cleaned the room.

286
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:12,430
"In his note he's written, I will take the
dogs (and the cat, too, of course!).

287
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,990
He's taken the animals to Heron Lake with
him!

288
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,850
But why has he suddenly done that?

289
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,490
He asked me and Bert to look after them.

290
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,550
He didn't say anything about it on the telephone
last night.

291
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,430
But wait a minute!

292
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,600
I remember now!

293
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,160
He said something about the animals that I
couldn't hear.

294
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,970
Maybe he was trying to tell me about a new
plan."

295
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,400
Mrs. Oakes finished cleaning the house, locked
it, and went home.

296
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,510
She thought that the animals were traveling
north, on vacation with Longridge in the back

297
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,990
of his car.

298
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:06,270
She had no idea that they were now on a lonely
country road, going west.

299
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,900
For the first hour of their journey the animals
moved quite quickly.

300
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,650
The bull terrier and the Labrador walked together.

301
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:22,600
The old dog couldn't see out of his left eye,
so the Labrador walked near him on his left

302
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,040
side.

303
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,760
Behind them came the cat.

304
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,740
Always curious, he often stopped for a few
minutes to look at things.

305
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,020
Then he had to run after the dogs.

306
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:44,120
His long, thin body moved quickly along the
road with his tail close to the ground.

307
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,290
Soon the old dog got tired, so they turned
off the quiet road.

308
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:56,070
They stopped in a wood next to a clear, fast-running
stream.

309
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,470
The bull terrier was very thirsty and drank
deeply.

310
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:06,450
The cat walked over to a rock and sat on it.

311
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:13,800
Later, they rested in the dry leaves under
the trees.

312
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,090
The old dog lay, exhausted, with his eyes
half closed.

313
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,400
The cat was busy washing himself as usual.

314
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,660
After about an hour the young dog got up and
started to walk toward the road.

315
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:38,090
The old dog stood up with difficulty and followed
the Labrador, his head low.

316
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,270
The cat finished washing himself and danced
into the sunlight.

317
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:48,250
He played with a leaf and then ran straight
to the dogs.

318
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,300
All that afternoon they walked along the quiet
country road.

319
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,850
When the young dog heard a car, they moved
to the side, onto the grass.

320
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:08,440
By late afternoon the cat was still walking
smoothly and strongly, and the young dog was

321
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,020
fresh, too.

322
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,910
But the old terrier was exhausted and could
only walk very slowly.

323
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:23,940
They turned off the road into the woods and
the terrier stood for a minute, his heavy

324
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,880
head down.

325
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,050
He was tired and hungry, and the place looked
safe and comfortable.

326
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,990
He lay down on his side to rest his aching
body.

327
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:42,860
The cat looked around carefully and then lay
down in the leaves near him.

328
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:50,750
The young dog disappeared to find some water,
then came back and lay down a little way from

329
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,460
the others.

330
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,350
The old dog was shaking badly, exhausted and
weak.

331
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,120
At last his eyes closed and he fell asleep.

332
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,960
Later, when it was dark, the Labrador moved
over and lay down close to the bull terrier.

333
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,700
The cat moved closer too and lay between his
paws.

334
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:22,850
And so, warm and comfortable with his two
friends, the old dog forgot about the pain

335
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,310
in his tired, aching body.

336
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:34,210
In the middle of the night a strange noise,
like a baby's crying, woke the terrier up.

337
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,770
When he looked around he couldn't see the
cat.

338
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,890
Tao was hunting in the woods.

339
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,600
The young dog slept badly.

340
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,730
He often woke up, nervously lifting his head.

341
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,450
He barked softly from time to time, and once
jumped up to his feet.

342
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:07,021
In this wild, dangerous place only one thing
was clear to him: he was going home, home

343
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:10,320
to his dear master.

344
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,530
Home was in the west, he knew.

345
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,550
But he couldn't leave the other two.

346
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:24,660
He must take them with him, all the way.

347
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,300
CHAPTER THREE
Danger!

348
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,180
Bears!

349
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,640
Finally the terrier stopped.

350
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,660
He fell to the ground, closed his eyes, and
didn't move.

351
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:48,150
In the early morning the bull terrier woke
up and struggled to his feet.

352
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,180
He was very cold, hungry, and thirsty.

353
00:29:53,180 --> 00:30:00,330
He walked slowly toward a pool, passing the
cat with a bird in his paws on the way.

354
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,500
The old dog watched the cat as he started
to eat.

355
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,970
His tail wagged with interest.

356
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:15,990
The cat finished the bird, looked at Bodger,
and then proudly walked away.

357
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,090
There was no meat on the dead bird's body
for the poor old terrier.

358
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,760
He drank long and deeply from the pool and
ate some grass.

359
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,840
But he was still very hungry.

360
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,170
Soon the young dog walked over.

361
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:40,400
Bodger was glad to see Luath and slowly followed
him toward the road.

362
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,920
A few seconds later the cat joined them.

363
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,070
He was looking happy after his delicious breakfast.

364
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:56,750
In the gray light of early morning, the three
friends continued along the side of the road.

365
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:02,460
In the middle of the day they rested by a
stream.

366
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,500
The dogs watched the cat as he caught and
killed a small animal.

367
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,040
The terrier moved toward the cat with his
mouth open and a hopeful look in his eyes.

368
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:20,780
But Tao ran off with the animal and both dogs
stayed hungry.

369
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:30,670
A few minutes later, the cat came back, sat
down, and started washing himself.

370
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,890
The old dog walked away to search for food.

371
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,900
He found nothing.

372
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:45,890
Sadly he lay down under a tree, put his paws
on his dirty face, and washed himself.

373
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:52,170
The Labrador wanted food, too, but he wasn't
a real hunter.

374
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:57,070
He often went hunting with men, but not alone.

375
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:04,400
He drank deeply at a stream and then they
all started their journey again.

376
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,330
The road went high over the hilly, wooded
country.

377
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:17,761
Below them, the land was full of incredibly
beautiful colors: red, yellow, gold, and dark

378
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:18,761
green.

379
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:25,480
Late in the afternoon the old dog slowed down.

380
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,880
He was very weak and his body was shaking.

381
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,670
The cat noticed this and started to walk closer
to his struggling old friend.

382
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,650
Finally the terrier stopped.

383
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:45,340
He fell to the ground, closed his eyes, and
didn't move.

384
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,160
The young dog looked worried.

385
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,350
He pushed the old dog with his nose again
and again and barked loudly.

386
00:32:54,350 --> 00:33:00,140
The cat joined him and tried to wake the terrier
up, too.

387
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,540
But Bodger didn't move.

388
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:11,920
The Labrador and the cat sat by the terrier's
side, worried and afraid.

389
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,630
At last they got up and left him.

390
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:22,270
The Labrador disappeared into the trees and
the cat started hunting for his supper.

391
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:30,200
It began to get dark and windy, but still
the old dog didn't move.

392
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,250
Leaves flew over him and covered his dirty,
old body.

393
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,210
Then the wind stopped and the wood was silent
again.

394
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,280
Suddenly, there was a sound of a large animal
in the wood.

395
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,860
Out of the trees came a young, half-grown
bear!

396
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:58,700
Its round ears stood up and its small, curious
eyes shone in its sharp little face.

397
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:05,490
Its mother stood behind it, interested in
something on the ground.

398
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,980
The young bear saw the terrier and watched
him for a minute.

399
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,669
Then it slowly moved toward him.

400
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:17,190
The terrier opened his eyes.

401
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,819
He could feel the danger near him.

402
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:27,429
Then the bear put its long paw on the dog's
white head.

403
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,679
The terrier barked weakly and the bear jumped
back.

404
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,379
But the dog was quiet, so it came nearer again.

405
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:44,559
The excited bear hit the terrier with its
paw, harder this time.

406
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,619
The old dog wasn't strong enough to fight
back.

407
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:54,419
He barked in pain, and bravely tried to struggle
to his feet.

408
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:57,380
The bear attacked his aching shoulder.

409
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,720
The smell of blood excited it and it climbed
on top of the dog's body.

410
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,730
It started to play with the terrier's long
white tail, biting the end of it like a child

411
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,440
with a new toy.

412
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,309
But the poor old dog couldn't move.

413
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:21,340
He lay down with his eyes closed, feeling
no pain.

414
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,299
Around the corner of the road came the cat
with a large dead bird in his mouth.

415
00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:32,950
When he saw the bear, he stopped suddenly.

416
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:38,569
He dropped the bird, and a terrible change
took place in him.

417
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,839
His huge blue eyes shone angrily in his dark
face.

418
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,700
Every hair on his body stood up, so he looked
twice his real size.

419
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,410
His chocolate-colored tail moved from side
to side.

420
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,279
He lay low on the ground, ready to attack.

421
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:02,730
And when the bear turned around, the cat jumped.

422
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:10,119
The bear screamed in pain and fear as the
cat landed on the back of its neck.

423
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:16,400
Again and again the cat attacked, and the
young bear's body was soon covered m blood.

424
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,849
Its screams were answered by its mother.

425
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:24,859
The great black bear hurried through the trees
to protect her baby.

426
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:30,809
She attacked the cat with a huge paw, but
the cat was too quick for her.

427
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:38,760
With a terrible, angry cry he jumped down
to the ground and disappeared behind a tree.

428
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,750
The mother turned and saw the old dog.

429
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:52,910
As she listened to the cries of fear and pain
from the young bear, she felt crazy and angry.

430
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,619
She stood up to her full height, ready for
attack.

431
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:02,809
Her red eyes shone angrily, and her head moved
from side to side.

432
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:05,440
The cat saw this.

433
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,710
He ran back to help his friend.

434
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:17,460
When the mother bear heard the cat's terrible
screams, she felt nervous and afraid.

435
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,630
She lowered her head, and started to move
back.

436
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:30,720
Slowly, purposefully, the cat moved closer,
and again the bear moved back.

437
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,960
The cat stopped and moved his tail from side
to side.

438
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,849
The bear stopped, too, afraid of this strange,
terrible animal.

439
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:48,990
Suddenly, the Labrador jumped out from behind
the trees, barking loudly.

440
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,559
Every hair on his red-gold back stood up.

441
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,640
When the bear saw the two of them, she ran
toward her baby.

442
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,230
There was one more cry from the bears and
then they disappeared into the wood.

443
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,650
Everything was quiet again.

444
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,319
The cat changed back to his usual size.

445
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:19,040
His eyes became calm again and lost their
angry look.

446
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,579
He shook each paw and slowly walked back to
his dead bird.

447
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:31,930
The young dog went over to his old friend
and touched him lovingly with his nose.

448
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,890
The terriers body was covered in blood.

449
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,250
The Labrador tried to clean it with his rough
tongue.

450
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:46,680
He barked near the old dog's head, but the
terrier didn't move.

451
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,960
At last the Labrador lay down next to him
on the grass.

452
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:00,070
His eyes were nervous, the hairs on his back
stood up, and from time to time he barked.

453
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:07,519
He watched Tao as he pulled a large gray bird
up to the old dog's nose.

454
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,869
Slowly the cat began to break open the bird's
body, and soon the smell of the warm meat

455
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,829
reached the terrier.

456
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:20,460
He opened one eye and wagged his tail.

457
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,660
Then he sat up.

458
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,470
He was shaking badly, and his body was wet
and bloody.

459
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,299
But when he saw the bird, he looked interested.

460
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:36,200
He pushed his nose against it and began to
eat.

461
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,600
The cat sat down near him, proudly washing
his tail.

462
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,250
The old dog ate quickly.

463
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:51,650
As his friends watched, they could see his
body get stronger.

464
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:57,329
Then he slept, and by night he was able to
walk to the soft grass at the side of the

465
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,150
road with the Labrador.

466
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,240
He lay down again.

467
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,970
An hour or two later, the cat joined them,
carelessly dropping another bird near his

468
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,940
old friend's nose.

469
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,720
The terrier ate it quickly and then went to
sleep.

470
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,920
The cat sat against his chest and the young
dog lay at his back.

471
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,670
They stayed awake, looking for signs of danger.

472
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:38,570
Neither animal moved from their old friend's
side all night.

473
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,059
CHAPTER FOUR
The White Dog of the Indians

474
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:54,170
His thin tail began to wag from side to side
and his black eyes shone in his old white

475
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,859
face.

476
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:02,599
Somewhere, not too far away, were human beings.

477
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,619
His world!

478
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:12,549
The next day the old terrier was still weak
and exhausted after the adventure with the

479
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,440
bear.

480
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,759
There was blood all over his aching body.

481
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:26,119
All day he lay on the grass in the warm fall
sunshine, sleeping deeply.

482
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:31,440
He wagged his tail when one of his friends
came near.

483
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,109
The Labrador was now very hungry, but he wasn't
a skillful hunter.

484
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,420
He spent the day searching for food.

485
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,970
In the evening, at last, he succeeded in catching
a small animal.

486
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:51,440
He ate the delicious, warm meat quickly.

487
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,940
They slept in the same place that night and
most of the following day.

488
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,160
The weather continued warm and sunny.

489
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,450
By the third day the old dog seemed better
and was able to walk around comfortably.

490
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:12,940
So, in the late afternoon, they started their
journey again.

491
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:20,130
They walked slowly along the road for a few
kilometers and arrived at a small lake.

492
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:28,280
They were sitting at the side of the lake
when the young dog suddenly turned his head.

493
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,589
He could smell wood smoke far away...

494
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:38,029
Seconds later, the old dog smelled it too
and got up.

495
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:44,760
His thin tail began to wag from side to side
and his black eyes shone in his old white

496
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,230
face.

497
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,410
Somewhere, not too far away, were human beings.

498
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,569
His world!

499
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:58,490
He couldn't refuse their invitation: they
were cooking something delicious.

500
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,470
He hurried off toward the wonderful smell.

501
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:11,480
The young dog followed more slowly and the
cat ran past them both.

502
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,099
The smell was coming from wood smoke, rice,
and chicken.

503
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:23,480
When the hungry animals looked down from the
hill, they saw some small boats by the side

504
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,700
of a lake.

505
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,970
Near the boats were six or seven fires, and
tents in the trees.

506
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:38,890
In the light of the fires they could see the
flat, brown faces of North American Indians,

507
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,660
talking in the firelight.

508
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:48,450
The men looked colorful in jeans and bright
shirts, but the women were dressed in dark

509
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,540
colors.

510
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:57,589
Two young boys, the only children there, were
moving from fire to fire.

511
00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:01,970
They were helping to cook the rice and meat.

512
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,880
Some of the men lay back from the fires, smoking
lazily.

513
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,750
They talked quietly to each other.

514
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:14,049
The old dog couldn't see all this clearly.

515
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:19,430
But he could hear and smell everything and
couldn't wait.

516
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:25,190
He walked carefully down the hill because
his shoulder was still aching.

517
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:31,310
One of the boys looked up and watched the
terrier.

518
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:38,740
Bodger came out of the shadows and into the
firelight, friendly and sure of a warm welcome.

519
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:49,579
His tail wagged from side to side and he had
his big, ugly smile on his face.

520
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:56,520
There was a surprised silence and then the
smaller boy started to cry.

521
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,230
He ran to his mother and the Indians all started
talking excitedly.

522
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,160
For a second the old dog didn't know what
to do.

523
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,200
Then he walked toward the nearest boy, hopefully.

524
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:18,380
The boy ran away, but his mother came toward
the old dog.

525
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:25,410
She spoke some soft words to him, touched
his head, and smiled at him.

526
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:32,990
The old dog wagged his tail against her legs,
happy to be near a human being again.

527
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,670
The two boys moved closer.

528
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,339
The other Indians came nearer, too.

529
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:43,160
This was what the old dog loved.

530
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,279
There were people all around him.

531
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:48,900
They gave him meat and he ate it hungrily.

532
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,150
They laughed and gave him more.

533
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,310
Soon he grew tired and lay down, warm and
happy.

534
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,339
Then he looked up at the hillside for his
two friends.

535
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:08,660
Next, the long-legged, blue-eyed cat came
out of the darkness.

536
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:14,109
He walked up to the dog and calmly took a
piece of meat from him.

537
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,349
The Indians couldn't stop laughing.

538
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:22,589
The two little boys lay on the ground, kicking
their legs with excitement.

539
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:28,339
The terrier loved children and started playing
with them.

540
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:34,890
All this time the young dog stayed on the
hillside, watching his friends below with

541
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,319
the Indians.

542
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:43,190
He saw the cat, well fed and happy, lying
by the fire in the arms of one of the sleepy

543
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,200
children.

544
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,539
He saw one of the Indian women washing the
blood from the terrier's body.

545
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:56,140
Then she put a piece of meat on the grass
in front of the old dog.

546
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,849
The hungry Labrador watched as the terrier
ate it.

547
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:06,690
When the fires began to burn low, the Indians
got ready for bed.

548
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:12,859
But the old dog and the cat were comfortable
and didn't move.

549
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:16,650
The young dog on the hillside started barking.

550
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,390
When they heard him, the other two woke up.

551
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:28,279
The cat jumped down from the arms of the sleepy
little Indian boy and ran toward the terrier.

552
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:36,920
He shook himself and walked slowly after the
cat, away from the warm fire.

553
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,990
The Indians watched silently.

554
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,329
They didn't try to stop the animals.

555
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:49,799
Only the mother called out softly, saying
goodbye to the travelers.

556
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:57,140
The old dog looked back once or twice, but
he could hear the Labrador's loud bark.

557
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,859
Then the two animals disappeared into the
blackness of the night.

558
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:07,140
The Indians never forgot their two visitors.

559
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,550
The old dog became the famous "White Dog of
the Indians."

560
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:16,059
"He was sent to bring us luck," they said.

561
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:21,180
"We welcomed him, fed him, and looked after
him.

562
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:29,630
We will have great luck in the future."

563
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:36,819
CHAPTER FIVE
An Invitation to Dinner

564
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:39,840
He belonged at home with his master.

565
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,310
Nothing mattered except this.

566
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:54,190
And he had to take his two friends with him,
through wild, unknown country.

567
00:48:54,190 --> 00:49:01,259
The three friends continued on their journey
for the next few days with no new adventures

568
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:03,549
or excitement.

569
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:09,880
At night they slept in the woods, warm and
comfortable under the leaves on the ground.

570
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,559
At first, in the day, they often stopped and
rested.

571
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,200
The old dog was too weak to go far.

572
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:26,109
But he got stronger every day and after a
week looked much better.

573
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:31,809
In fact, he looked younger and healthier than
at the beginning of the journey.

574
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:38,049
Most of the time he was happy as he walked
along with his friends.

575
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:44,900
He was always hungry, but the skillful hunter,
the cat, found food for him.

576
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,119
But the Labrador really suffered.

577
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,119
He had very little to eat.

578
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:57,500
While the other two animals were resting,
he always looked for food.

579
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:04,420
When they played together, he sat away from
them, nervous and uncomfortable.

580
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:10,069
He could never forget his purpose: he was
going home.

581
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:12,849
He belonged at home with his master.

582
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,660
Nothing mattered except this.

583
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:23,359
And he had to take his two friends with him,
through wild, unknown country.

584
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:32,230
They traveled along old country roads and
sometimes straight through fields and woods.

585
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,640
On good days they walked as many as twenty-five
kilometers.

586
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,780
The weather was fine, with warm, sunny days.

587
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:47,890
This was a good thing because the bull terrier's
hair was short and thin.

588
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,760
The Labrador's hair was flat and thick and
he never felt the cold like the old dog.

589
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:02,239
The cat was enjoying the adventure, sometimes
leaving the other two for an hour or more.

590
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,589
They didn't worry, as he always returned.

591
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:13,779
The days were warm but the nights were cold,
and the old dog suffered then.

592
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:19,039
The leaves on the trees were quickly losing
their color.

593
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:25,830
Many of the birds of the forest started to
fly to warmer places in the south.

594
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:30,809
Once they saw another bear, but it was fat
and sleepy.

595
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:35,160
It was sitting in the sun when the three friends
saw it.

596
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,210
It looked up lazily but wasn't interested
in them.

597
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:45,089
But the cat looked angry for about an hour
after this meeting.

598
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:49,779
The animals didn't see any more human beings
for days.

599
00:51:49,779 --> 00:51:57,480
Then one day, when the old dog was alone,
he saw an old man.

600
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:04,700
The terrier loved people and his tail began
to wag from side to side in welcome.

601
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:11,690
The man was carrying a bag and talking quietly
to himself.

602
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:17,720
When he saw the old dog, he lifted his old
green hat from his white hair.

603
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,240
He smiled kindly at the terrier and said hello.

604
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,619
The old dog started to follow him.

605
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:35,630
Soon the cat followed, too, and far behind
them came the Labrador.

606
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,720
After about a kilometer, they arrived at a
small cabin and walked through the yard to

607
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,450
the front steps.

608
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:48,339
Here the old man put his bag down and opened
the green door.

609
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:51,510
He then invited his new friends to come in.

610
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:59,220
The old dog walked in with the cat near his
shoulder, then the man.

611
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:06,660
The young dog waited outside, unsure at first,
and then followed the others.

612
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:11,359
A delicious, meaty smell filled the front
room.

613
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:19,660
The old man hung up his hat, walked over to
the fire, and put on some more wood.

614
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:25,930
He washed his hands and then looked in a pot
on the stove.

615
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:30,569
The three hungry animals watched him carefully.

616
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:35,869
The man took four plates from a cupboard and
put them on the table.

617
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:41,170
As he put the food on the plates, the old
dog moved nearer.

618
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:48,809
The old man sat down, looked around the table,
and said, "Please, sit down."

619
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:56,150
The three animals sat down on the floor behind
him and waited patiently.

620
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:03,349
The old man ate slowly and carefully as the
animals watched.

621
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:04,450
Soon his plate was empty.

622
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:14,660
Then he looked around the table and said,
in a surprised voice, "You haven't eaten your

623
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,660
food!"

624
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,839
He looked at the three full plates thoughtfully
for a long time.

625
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:27,089
Then he got up, picked up one of them, and
ate all the food on it.

626
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:31,619
He got up again and picked up the second plate.

627
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:36,480
When that was empty, he ate the food on the
third plate.

628
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,279
His three visitors sat and watched.

629
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,589
None of them moved.

630
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:48,630
They never jumped up on chairs and ate at
the table with the Hunters or with Longridge.

631
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,819
So they stayed politely on the floor and waited.

632
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:57,059
But they felt very, very hungry.

633
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:00,599
The old man sat at the table when the last
plate was empty.

634
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:06,999
He was lost in his private thoughts and forgot
about his visitors.

635
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:13,239
After some time a bird flew in through the
window and broke the silence.

636
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:20,309
The old man got up, looked around, and noticed
the animals by the door.

637
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:24,749
He looked surprised and smiled down at them
kindly.

638
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:29,609
"You must come more often," he said.

639
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:31,920
Then he looked at the old dog.

640
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,039
He was wagging his tail.

641
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:39,979
"Please say hello to your dear mother from
me!"

642
00:55:39,979 --> 00:55:42,759
He opened the door for the animals.

643
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:48,809
They walked out, through the yard, and into
the wood, their heads down and their tails

644
00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:49,809
low.

645
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:58,119
None of them looked back at the old man.

646
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:04,499
CHAPTER SIX
Lost in the River

647
00:56:04,499 --> 00:56:09,190
A large piece of wood hit the cat on the head.

648
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:21,520
He was swept under and over and over, and
was carried away down the river.

649
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,279
The next day the travelers came down from
the hills to a river which ran from north

650
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:28,220
to south.

651
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,329
It was very wide and deep.

652
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:34,809
The Labrador knew that his two friends hated
water.

653
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:38,690
They didn't even like getting their feet wet.

654
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:44,440
But they all had to get across to the other
side.

655
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,470
Luath tried to find a shallow part of the
river.

656
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:53,200
Once or twice he went into the water and swam
around.

657
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,940
He looked back at the other two, inviting
them in.

658
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:03,279
But they stayed on the side of the river,
sitting close together.

659
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:09,319
In this lonely, wild country there were no
human beings and no bridges.

660
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:14,520
The young dog continued searching for an easy
place to cross.

661
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:22,210
But the river got wider and wider, and after
four or five kilometers he lost patience.

662
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:27,500
He ran into the water and swam quickly and
strongly to the other side.

663
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,150
He loved the water and felt completely comfortable
in it.

664
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:38,999
He stood on the other side of the river, looking
back at the old dog and the cat.

665
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:44,390
He barked loudly, but they looked nervous
and afraid.

666
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:51,729
At last, the young dog swam back to his friends
and waited in the shallow water.

667
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:56,710
The terrier joined him, but he was shaking
with cold and fear.

668
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:04,640
Once again the Labrador swam across the river,
climbed out onto the far side, shook himself,

669
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,640
and barked.

670
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,569
His bark meant: "You two must follow me!

671
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,079
Come on!

672
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:13,549
It's easy!"

673
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:17,010
The old dog stepped into the water.

674
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,789
The Labrador swam back to help him.

675
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:27,650
This happened three times, and the third time
the old dog walked into the river up to his

676
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,510
chest.

677
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,109
Then he started swimming.

678
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:37,289
He wasn't a very good swimmer: he held his
head high out of the water,

679
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:40,180
and his little black eyes looked scared.

680
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:47,390
But he was a brave bull terrier and he continued
following the Labrador.

681
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:52,109
At last he reached the other side and climbed
out onto dry land.

682
00:58:52,109 --> 00:58:58,820
He ran around happily, lay on his back, and
dried himself in the long grass.

683
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:09,130
Then he joined the Labrador at the side of
the river and barked at the cat.

684
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:13,599
The poor cat now showed the first signs of
fear on the journey.

685
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,880
He was alone and didn't want to swim across
this terrible river.

686
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,220
But he had to join his friends on the other
side.

687
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:28,030
He ran up and down, crying out to the other
two animals.

688
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:34,779
The young dog swam back and waited in the
water.

689
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:39,749
After a long time, the cat suddenly decided
to cross.

690
00:59:39,749 --> 00:59:44,880
He ran into the water and started swimming
toward the Labrador.

691
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,690
He was a surprisingly good swimmer, quickly
reaching the middle of the river.

692
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,099
But then a terrible accident happened!

693
00:59:54,099 --> 01:00:01,619
There was an old dam on a smaller stream that
ran into the river about three kilometers

694
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:02,619
away.

695
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:09,220
It was built from small trees and pieces of
wood and wasn't very strong.

696
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:17,200
Suddenly it broke, and a wave of water poured
into the river and hit the two animals!

697
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,509
The brave young dog tried to protect the cat,
but he was too late.

698
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:28,483
The wave passed over them and a large piece
of wood hit the cat on the head.

699
01:00:28,483 --> 01:00:37,130
He was swept under and over and over, and
was carried away down the river.

700
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,609
The old dog barked wildly on the side of the
river.

701
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:45,989
Then he jumped into the water and swam.

702
01:00:45,989 --> 01:00:53,739
He tried to save the cat, but the water knocked
him back and he had to swim to the side again.

703
01:00:53,739 --> 01:01:00,300
The young dog was a strong swimmer, but he
swam with great difficulty.

704
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:05,910
The river carried him a kilometer before he
could put his feet down.

705
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:11,520
When he reached dry land, he quickly climbed
out onto the grass.

706
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,900
He ran down the side of the river, looking
for the cat.

707
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,319
He could see his little body, half under water.

708
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:26,150
But he was never near enough to catch his
friend.

709
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,634
Soon Luath was far behind and couldn't see
Tao at all.

710
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:36,569
He came to a place where steep rocks formed
the side of the river.

711
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,089
The path took him high above the water.

712
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:46,250
When it came down again, there was no sign
of the cat.

713
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:50,740
It was almost dark when the Labrador returned
to the terrier.

714
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:57,049
Bodger was walking toward him along the river,
tired and unhappy.

715
01:01:57,049 --> 01:02:00,529
The Labrador was exhausted, too.

716
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:04,170
He greeted the old dog and then dropped to
the ground.

717
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:08,810
He only got up when he needed a drink.

718
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:13,410
They spent that night by the side of the river.

719
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,720
They lay close together to get comfortable
and warm.

720
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:23,729
When a thin, cold rain fell, they moved under
an old tree.

721
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:29,510
In the middle of the night the old dog sat
up, shaking with cold.

722
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,749
He threw his head back and cried out to the
heavy, black sky.

723
01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:38,170
He missed his dear, lost friend.

724
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,270
He wanted to see him by his side again.

725
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:49,619
At last the young dog got up sadly and the
two started their lonely journey again, away

726
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:56,509
from the river and over the hills to the west.

727
01:02:56,509 --> 01:03:00,229
CHAPTER SEVEN
A Loving Family

728
01:03:00,229 --> 01:03:08,499
'This cat's been in the water for a long time,"
he said.

729
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:10,410
"He's very weak.

730
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:15,609
Shall we try to save him?"

731
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:21,119
Many kilometers down the river there was a
small cabin, with beautiful red flowers in

732
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,739
the windows, and a blue front door.

733
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:31,650
Vegetables grew in the yard, and there were
apple trees and green fields around the house.

734
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,960
Reino Nurmi and his wife lived here.

735
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:43,089
They came from Finland and had a ten-year-old
daughter, Helvi.

736
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:46,579
Life was hard in this wild place near the
forest.

737
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:50,509
But the Nurmis were strong people.

738
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:54,509
They worked hard and had a good, simple life.

739
01:03:54,509 --> 01:03:57,819
They ate the food that they grew.

740
01:03:57,819 --> 01:04:02,170
They caught fish in the river and sold wood.

741
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:08,650
Unlike her parents, Helvi was born in Canada.

742
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:13,930
Every day she walked through the lonely country
to the school bus.

743
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:20,660
And every afternoon, when she came home, she
told her parents about life outside their

744
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:24,700
small farm.

745
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:30,670
One Sunday afternoon, Helvi was playing down
by the river.

746
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:34,480
She was throwing stones across the water.

747
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,609
She was lonely and wanted a friend to play
with.

748
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:43,309
Suddenly, a big wave came past.

749
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:48,519
Helvi was safe because she wasn't standing
in the river.

750
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:53,009
She stood and watched, then saw something
strange.

751
01:04:53,009 --> 01:04:55,190
What was it?

752
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:59,119
It looked like a small, wet body!

753
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:08,300
It turned round and round in the water, and
was then pushed onto the rocks.

754
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:12,589
Helvi ran along by the water to look more
closely.

755
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:14,630
Then she shouted out to her mother.

756
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,630
"Mother!

757
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,630
Mother!

758
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,019
Come here quickly!

759
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:22,400
There's a strange animal in the river!

760
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,750
It's caught in the rocks!"

761
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:31,650
Mrs. Nurmi was out in the yard, planting vegetables.

762
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:39,160
She hurried down to the side of the river,
calling to her husband at the same time.

763
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:45,710
He followed her, walking calmly with a quiet,
thoughtful face.

764
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:52,589
They all looked down in silence at the small,
thin body on the rocks.

765
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:59,170
Then Mr. Nurmi put his hand lightly on it
and pulled back the skin above and below one

766
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,490
eye.

767
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:06,339
He turned and saw Helvi's worried face close
to his.

768
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:11,310
"This cat's been in the water for a long time,"
he said.

769
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:13,190
"He's very weak.

770
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,799
Shall we try to save him?"

771
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:21,190
Helvi and her mother both wanted to save the
poor animal.

772
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:28,640
So Mr. Nurmi picked up the wet cat and walked
back to the cabin.

773
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:34,079
He put the cat down in a sunny place by the
fire and dried him.

774
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:42,829
Then Helvi's mother opened his teeth and Helvi
poured a little warm milk into his mouth.

775
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:48,960
The cat shook, coughed, and some milk came
out of his mouth.

776
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,250
Mr. Nurmi pressed his body.

777
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:58,640
The cat coughed again and a stream of river
water came out of his mouth.

778
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,890
Then he lay down and went to sleep.

779
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:05,009
Mr. Nurmi smiled happily.

780
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:09,259
"Keep him warm and quiet," he told Helvi.

781
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:12,539
"But are you sure you want a cat?"

782
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:21,619
"Oh, yes!" answered Helvi, as she looked down
at the sleeping animal by the fire.

783
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:25,880
Her mother went into the kitchen to make supper.

784
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:30,140
Her father left to feed the chickens.

785
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:35,869
Helvi sat by the cat and watched patiently.

786
01:07:35,869 --> 01:07:42,779
Sometimes she put her hand near the fire and
touched the soft, warm body.

787
01:07:42,779 --> 01:07:46,349
After about half an hour the cat woke up.

788
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:50,400
Helvi looked closely into the bright blue
eyes.

789
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,469
The cat looked back and slowly started to
move.

790
01:07:55,469 --> 01:08:01,900
Very excited, Helvi called to her parents.

791
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:08,249
After another half hour, she was holding the
Siamese cat in her arms.

792
01:08:08,249 --> 01:08:11,940
Then she gave him some milk.

793
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,299
He usually hated milk, but he drank it quickly.

794
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:21,730
Then he started washing himself from head
to foot.

795
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:27,660
As the Nurmi family ate their supper, he finished
a bowl of meat.

796
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:35,550
Then he walked around the table legs, asking
for more food, his tail straight in the air.

797
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:40,290
Helvi thought he was wonderful.

798
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:44,430
That night the Nurmis were having fresh fish.

799
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:52,320
It was cooked in the country way with the
head still on, in a soup with potatoes.

800
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,770
Helvi put the head with

801
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:59,540
some soup and potatoes into a bowl and placed
it on the floor.

802
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,810
The cat ate everything, holding the bowl down
with his paws.

803
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:11,000
Happy at last, he lay down near Helvi s feet
and went to sleep.

804
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:18,810
For the first time in her life, Helvi had
her own pet.

805
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:21,980
Helvi carried the cat up to bed with her.

806
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:26,440
He lay on her shoulder as she climbed the
steep stairs to her little room at the top

807
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,940
of the house.

808
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:34,260
She put him into the old wooden bed that she
slept in as a baby.

809
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,210
He went to sleep there happily.

810
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:43,550
Late in the night she woke up when the cat
climbed on her back.

811
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:49,060
The weather outside was cold, wet, and windy.

812
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,530
Helvi got up to shut the window.

813
01:09:51,530 --> 01:10:00,920
Then she lay down again and felt the warm,
comfortable body of the cat on her bed.

814
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:08,080
When Helvi left in the morning for the long
walk and ride to school, the cat lay by the

815
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,960
window.

816
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:15,480
His hair shone in the sun as he washed himself
sleepily.

817
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,500
His eyes followed Mrs. Nurmi as she moved
about the cabin.

818
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:26,020
She went outside with the washing and looked
back at the cat.

819
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,980
He was standing on his back legs, looking
out at her.

820
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:35,750
His mouth was opening and shutting behind
the window.

821
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:40,500
She ran back, opened the door, and he followed
her to the washing line.

822
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:48,330
He sat by her and then followed her around
the cabin and yard all morning.

823
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:54,470
When she shut him in the cabin once by mistake,
he cried out loudly.

824
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:58,260
He followed the Nurmis around all day.

825
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,980
"Why is he watching us all the time?"

826
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,990
Mrs. Nurmi asked her husband.

827
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,500
"Maybe he needs to be near people."

828
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:13,280
But her husband noticed the worried look in
the cat's blue eyes.

829
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,880
When a bird flew near him, he didn't look
up.

830
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:23,660
"No, it's because he can't hear," Mr. Nurmi
said.

831
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:28,520
"I think the poor cat's deaf!"

832
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,640
Helvi ran most of the way home across the
fields.

833
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,560
When she saw the cat, she picked him up.

834
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:41,790
He sat on her shoulder while she helped her
mother with the supper.

835
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:44,430
She saw that her father was right.

836
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:50,140
The cat was deaf and his ears didn't turn
toward any sound.

837
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:57,760
After supper her parents sat by the fire and
Helvi read to them.

838
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,450
Because they were Finnish, they couldn't read
English.

839
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:09,490
But Helvi learned English every day at school,
so she helped them with the new language.

840
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:19,310
They sat and rested, with the cat near their
feet, and listened to the child's soft voice.

841
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:26,380
She had a book about Siamese cats: great,
proud Siamese cats from all over the world.

842
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:32,290
As they listened, they looked down at their
visitor.

843
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:37,990
He lay in front of the fire with his tail
sometimes moving.

844
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:44,260
His beautiful blue eyes watched their daughter's
hand as she turned the pages of the book.

845
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:49,540
They touched his soft body and wonderful tail.

846
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,850
Then Helvi gave him a bowl of milk.

847
01:12:52,850 --> 01:13:01,490
He drank it proudly, like a king, before she
carried him upstairs to bed.

848
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:09,080
That night, and for one more night, the cat
lay happily in Helvi's arms.

849
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:15,930
In the daytime, while she was at school, he
followed her parents everywhere.

850
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:21,210
He walked close to her mother as she looked
for wood in the forest.

851
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:27,920
He sat at her feet on the front steps as she
prepared vegetables in the sun.

852
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:33,090
He followed Mr. Nurmi and his work horse across
the fields.

853
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:40,400
And in the late afternoons, when Helvi came
back from school, he was waiting for her.

854
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,590
He was one of the family.

855
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:47,440
But on the fourth night he changed.

856
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,150
He didn't seem comfortable on Helvi's bed.

857
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:55,390
He shook his head and cried out unhappily.

858
01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:00,710
At last he lay down and pushed his head into
her hand.

859
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:08,450
She noticed that his ears were moving; he
could hear every sound in the night outside!

860
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:12,560
She was happy that he wasn't deaf any more.

861
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,120
Soon she fell asleep.

862
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:22,100
When she woke up later in the night, the bed
felt cold.

863
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:28,850
She saw the cat near the open window, looking
out over the pale fields at the tall, dark

864
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:31,530
trees below.

865
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:35,750
His long tail moved from side to side.

866
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:44,550
She put out her hand, but he suddenly jumped
out of the window onto the soft ground below.

867
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,590
She looked down and called out.

868
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:51,870
His head turned for the first time to her
voice.

869
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:57,650
His eyes shone in the moonlight and then he
turned away.

870
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:01,170
She realized sadly that he was leaving.

871
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:03,330
He didn't need her now.

872
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:07,010
Crying, she watched him go into the night.

873
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,760
He walked toward the river.

874
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:20,489
Soon the running shadow of the cat was lost
in the other shadows.

875
01:15:20,489 --> 01:15:24,980
CHAPTER EIGHT
A Cat Fight

876
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:31,190
Suddenly, every hair on his back stood up!

877
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:36,320
He could hear and feel an animal behind him.

878
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,570
And it was not far away!

879
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:44,080
The cat was a fast traveler.

880
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,150
Only the rain slowed him down.

881
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:51,480
He hated the wet and hid under a tree with
his ears back.

882
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,100
When the rain stopped completely, he came
out.

883
01:15:55,100 --> 01:16:01,750
He walked uncomfortably through the wet grass
and often shook his paws.

884
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:07,070
Without his noisier friends, the dogs, the
curious cat saw everything.

885
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:12,750
He watched the forest animals, but they couldn't
see him.

886
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:16,400
When he met an animal face to face, it turned
away.

887
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,560
He only slept a little, up in the trees.

888
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,850
He was a smart and skillful traveler, afraid
of nothing.

889
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:32,080
Early on the second morning of his travels
alone, he went down to a lake to drink.

890
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:39,550
He suddenly saw two men on the side of the
lake with guns across their knees, and a dog.

891
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:44,260
The men called out to him, but the cat didn't
look up.

892
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:47,500
He put his pink tongue in the water and drank
slowly.

893
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:53,860
Both men called out again, amused by the cat.

894
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:59,340
At last he looked up, shook each paw, and
calmly walked away.

895
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:08,210
Behind him the men started laughing as the
proud cat continued his journey.

896
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:15,080
The two dogs felt very sad as they traveled
without the cat.

897
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:21,870
Tao was the terrier's oldest friend and he
missed him a lot.

898
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,530
The Labrador loved the cat, too, but

899
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:28,690
Tao and Bodger were special friends.

900
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:37,390
The two dogs tried to hunt for food, but without
the cat's help they didn't do very well.

901
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:40,160
One day they walked near a farm.

902
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,840
The young dog didn't want to meet any human
beings, but he was hungry.

903
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:51,760
They crossed an open field to steal one of
the farmer s chickens.

904
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:57,730
Suddenly, they heard an angry shout and saw
a man at the far corner of the field.

905
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:01,080
A black farm dog was with him.

906
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,160
It ran to attack them.

907
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:09,690
The Labrador was a terrible fighter and was
hungry and weak.

908
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:16,140
He was on his back, with the farm dog on top
of him, when brave Bodger jumped at the farm

909
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,810
dog's neck.

910
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:19,540
He knocked him over.

911
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:26,310
The farm dog struggled to his feet and the
terrier knocked him over again.

912
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:30,470
Then he turned and proudly walked away.

913
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:37,390
The farm dog, usually very brave, stood up
shakily.

914
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:40,540
His neck was covered in blood.

915
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:43,640
He ran away toward his master.

916
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:50,160
The farmer watched the two dogs running away
across the field with one of his chickens.

917
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:57,980
"Come back here!" he shouted angrily, but
the dogs were too far away.

918
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:03,590
Bodger felt stronger and braver after this
fight.

919
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:10,390
That evening he caught a small animal and
had a delicious supper.

920
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:15,000
Luath was badly hurt, but he seemed happier,
too.

921
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,070
Maybe it was because he could feel the west
wind.

922
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:22,200
Memories of home came back to him.

923
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:31,250
He knew that every day, every hour, they were
getting nearer.

924
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:35,680
The cat was following the Labrador and the
old terrier.

925
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,480
He knew which way to go.

926
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,140
He could smell his friends clearly.

927
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:46,320
But he began to feel nervous and afraid.

928
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:51,760
Something was wrong, something bad was following
him.

929
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,260
He started to walk through the forest more
quickly, looking for the blue sky and open

930
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:00,770
country far in front of him.

931
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:04,810
Suddenly, every hair on his back stood up!

932
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:09,770
He could hear and feel an animal behind him.

933
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:11,710
And it was not far away!

934
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:16,710
The cat jumped up into a tree and looked down.

935
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:22,530
There, moving silently through the forest,
was a huge cat!

936
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:27,030
And it was very different from an ordinary
cat like Tao.

937
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:35,080
This one was almost twice as large, heavy,
with a short tail and thick legs.

938
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:40,540
Its coat was soft gray, and darker in some
places.

939
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:46,900
It had the wild face of a killer, much stronger
and faster than Tao.

940
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,770
It was a lynx!

941
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:52,510
Tao quickly climbed to the top of the tree.

942
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:56,030
The lynx heard him and stopped suddenly.

943
01:20:56,030 --> 01:21:00,730
It looked up, lifting one heavy paw.

944
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:04,340
Its terrible eyes shone angrily.

945
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:07,481
The cat looked around nervously, searching
for a way to escape.

946
01:21:07,481 --> 01:21:16,340
His tail moved from side to side and he made
a low, scared noise.

947
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:20,440
Then the lynx started climbing the tree toward
the cat.

948
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:25,890
As its heavy body came nearer, the tree moved
dangerously.

949
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:30,330
The cat found it difficult to hold on.

950
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:33,690
Then the lynx attacked with its great paw.

951
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:41,110
The cat hit back, the tree moved wildly and
the cat fell to the ground.

952
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:46,960
He heard the lynx land near him, got up fast,
and ran for his life.

953
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:52,000
Almost immediately, he heard the lynx close
behind him.

954
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:58,990
The cat couldn't turn and fight: this was
a dangerous enemy, not a stupid bear.

955
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:03,510
As he ran away, he knew it was hopeless.

956
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:07,930
Every time the cat climbed up a tree, the
lynx followed.

957
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:13,240
Its great size shook the tree, and the cat
fell off again and again.

958
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:18,860
Then he saw a hole in the ground and ran into
it.

959
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,650
The hole was too small for the lynx to follow.

960
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:27,860
It lay on the ground and looked into the hole
with one terrible green eye.

961
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:32,920
But it soon moved back when some earth hit
it in the face.

962
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:40,810
The cat's back legs were working hard, throwing
earth out of the hole!

963
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:43,190
The lynx sat back and thought.

964
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:46,700
There was complete silence in the forest.

965
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:51,300
Deep in the hole, the cat waited, too scared
to do anything.

966
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:57,670
Suddenly, the lynx began to push the earth
around the hole to one side with its huge

967
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:58,790
paws.

968
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:03,020
It didn't hear a young boy behind it.

969
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,920
The boy was wearing a bright red jacket and
carrying a gun.

970
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,330
He was hunting, so he walked softly.

971
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:15,770
Suddenly, he saw the wild animal at the entrance
to the hole.

972
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:20,990
At exactly the same time, the lynx saw the
boy.

973
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:23,850
It made a terrible noise.

974
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:28,280
No fear showed in its angry eyes as it moved
toward the boy.

975
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:35,370
In a second, the boy lifted his gun and shot,
all in one quick movement.

976
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:39,750
The lynx turned over in the air and fell.

977
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:44,350
It hit the ground and lay there, dead.

978
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:48,250
The boy was shaking as he moved toward the
dead animal.

979
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:51,810
He couldn't forget the crazy look in the lynx's
eyes.

980
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:57,290
He looked down at it with a pale face but
he couldn't touch it.

981
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:00,500
The boy's father hurried toward his son.

982
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:06,180
He stopped suddenly when he saw the huge body
on the ground and his son's white face.

983
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:09,850
The man turned the animal over.

984
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,770
"Look, son," he said to the boy, smiling.

985
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:14,940
"Look at that hole.

986
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,440
That's where you shot it!"

987
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,670
The boy smiled back, still shaking.

988
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:25,580
"Tie this red cloth on the tree, son," said
his father.

989
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,770
"Then it'll be easy to find.

990
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,990
We'll come back later."

991
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:37,980
The boy tied the cloth tightly on the tree
and looked down at the lynx one more time.

992
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,120
Then father and son walked away together,
talking excitedly.

993
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:48,070
The hidden cat could hear their voices for
a long time.

994
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:53,420
When everything was silent, he came out of
his hiding place into the sun.

995
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,710
He was tired and dirty.

996
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:58,870
He didn't look at the dead body once.

997
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:05,080
He calmly walked around it, sat down near
it, and started washing his body from the

998
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,100
end of his tail to his nose.

999
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:13,680
Then he continued on his way, as calm and
proud as always.

1000
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:19,140
Two days later, the cat found the two dogs.

1001
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:25,730
He came down a hill into a valley and suddenly
saw his dear golden and white friends on the

1002
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:28,650
other side of a small stream.

1003
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:34,460
His tail moved in excitement, he opened his
mouth and cried out.

1004
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:40,600
The two dogs stopped immediately, listening
to the unbelievable sound in the valley.

1005
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,070
The cat jumped up onto a rock so that they
could see him clearly.

1006
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:52,070
The young dog started to bark loudly and hurried
across the stream.

1007
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:56,150
The old dog followed and the cat began to
run, too.

1008
01:25:56,150 --> 01:26:02,940
They met near the little stream, all of them
very excited.

1009
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:07,810
In his happiness, the old dog knocked the
cat over twice with his head!

1010
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:15,250
The cat ran straight up a tree and then dropped
down onto the old dog's back!

1011
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:18,570
The young dog stood there, slowly wagging
his tail.

1012
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:25,080
When the old dog was too tired to move, the
Labrador walked up to the cat.

1013
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:33,090
Tao stood on his back legs and put his chocolate-colored
front paws on the great dog's neck.

1014
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:39,130
That night the three friends were happier
than any other animals in the world.

1015
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:44,730
They lay close together under an old tree
near the stream.

1016
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:50,870
Bodger had his dear cat, warm and loving,
between his paws again.

1017
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,810
Luath stopped worrying.

1018
01:26:52,810 --> 01:27:03,460
His friend was back and he could continue
the journey with a lighter heart.

1019
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:06,770
CHAPTER NINE
A Welcome Rest

1020
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:16,110
He had a look of sadness in his little eyes
and he was too thin.

1021
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:28,710
This wasn't a brave adventurer'only a tired
old dog, hungry for food and love.

1022
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:33,750
Longridge's house was now three hundred kilometers
behind them.

1023
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:39,520
The three animals were all alive, but only
the cat was really healthy.

1024
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:46,880
The old dog still struggled along happily,
but the Labrador was really weak after the

1025
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,870
fight with the farm dog.

1026
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:53,030
His beautiful red-gold coat didn't shine.

1027
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:58,130
He couldn't open his mouth fully because of
an aching tooth, so he was hungry all the

1028
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,360
time.

1029
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:06,510
When the cat killed a small animal or bird,
he gave it to the Labrador.

1030
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:11,780
But the young dog could only drink the fresh
blood of the animal.

1031
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:17,430
Every day the two dogs walked along side by
side, brave and purposeful.

1032
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:23,250
They looked like two family pets out for a
walk around the neighborhood.

1033
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:28,650
One morning they were seen like this by a
man who was working in the forest.

1034
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:32,610
He was busy with the trees and didn't think
about them at the time.

1035
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:39,380
But later in the day, when he remembered the
two dogs, he was surprised.

1036
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,340
There were no houses for forty kilometers.

1037
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,010
So where did the dogs come from?

1038
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:50,050
He told his boss but his boss just laughed.

1039
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:52,940
He thought that his friend was imagining things!

1040
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:58,040
"What will you start dreaming about next?"
he asked.

1041
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:06,030
But a few days later, people started to talk
about the disappearance of the three animals.

1042
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:11,650
And then the boss stopped laughing.

1043
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:17,790
At Heron Lake, the vacation of John Longridge
and his brother was ending.

1044
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:24,670
In England, the excited Hunter family were
packed and ready to return home.

1045
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:32,710
Mrs. Oakes was busy in the old stone house,
while her husband worked in the yard.

1046
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:38,280
At the same time, the three animals continued
on their way.

1047
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:45,390
The country was less wild now, and once or
twice they saw small, lonely houses.

1048
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:50,360
The young dog stayed in the woods and didn't
go near them.

1049
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:58,260
But the old dog loved human beings and looked
at the houses with hopeful eyes.

1050
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,420
Late one afternoon they were followed by a
bear.

1051
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:07,710
It was curious about the animals but was no
danger to them.

1052
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:14,220
The young dog felt uncomfortable, though,
with the shadow of the great bear behind them.

1053
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:18,930
He decided to leave the woods and walk along
a quiet country road.

1054
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:27,990
As it got dark, they arrived at a few small
houses, a schoolhouse, and a white church.

1055
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:34,630
The young dog wanted to continue, but the
old dog suddenly refused to move.

1056
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:37,820
He was, as usual, very hungry.

1057
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:46,690
And when he saw the warm lights from the houses,
he wanted food, from the hand of a human being.

1058
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:52,400
His eyes grew bright at the thought and he
started to walk toward the houses.

1059
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,480
The young dog followed.

1060
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:59,000
He felt weak and sick after the fight with
the farm dog.

1061
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,080
His bad tooth was very painful.

1062
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,820
He wanted to lie down and rest his aching
head on the ground.

1063
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:14,000
As they passed the first houses, they could
smell the delicious smell of supper.

1064
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,130
They heard the sounds of human beings everywhere.

1065
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:22,500
The old dog stopped outside one of the houses.

1066
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:28,150
He walked up the steps, lifted his paw, and
knocked on the door.

1067
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:32,430
Then he sat down and listened hopefully.

1068
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:36,830
Soon the door opened and a small girl stood
in front of him.

1069
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:41,260
The old dog looked up at her with his ugly
smile on his face.

1070
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:45,600
The girl looked afraid and shouted out, "Dad!..."

1071
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,760
Then the door shut hard in the terrier's face.

1072
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:56,460
The old dog couldn't understand, but knocked
again.

1073
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:01,170
He saw a face at the window and barked politely
at it.

1074
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:07,480
Suddenly, the door was thrown open again and
a man ran out with a bowl of water in his

1075
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,480
hand.

1076
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,920
Angry, he threw the water in the old dog's
face.

1077
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:12,920
"Get out!

1078
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,900
Get out of here!"

1079
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,250
the man shouted.

1080
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:22,920
The wet terrier ran away fast toward the Labrador
and the cat.

1081
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,900
He wasn't afraid but he felt unhappy.

1082
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,950
Human beings were not usually like that when
he was friendly to them.

1083
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:36,110
They always laughed and played with him.

1084
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:40,880
He quietly followed the Labrador back along
the road.

1085
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,490
Three kilometers later, they arrived at a
farm.

1086
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:53,630
They crossed some dark fields and lay down
for the night outside one of the farm buildings.

1087
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:56,940
The young dog had a bad night.

1088
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:02,310
His mouth was aching and he was exhausted
with the pain.

1089
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:06,540
He got up in the night to drink from a small
lake.

1090
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:10,050
He stood chest-deep in the cold water.

1091
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:15,130
When the old dog woke up in the morning, he
was alone.

1092
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:22,170
The cat was hunting for his breakfast and
the young dog was down by the lake.

1093
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:26,050
The terrier could smell cooking through the
morning air.

1094
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:32,880
The pale sun was coming up in the sky as he
walked to the farmhouse door.

1095
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,460
He sat down on the steps and waited.

1096
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:43,690
His memory was short; human beings were friendly
again and gave dogs food.

1097
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:46,510
He knocked on the door with his paw.

1098
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:51,070
It opened and a wonderful smell of breakfast
came out.

1099
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:54,060
The terrier smiled his ugly smile.

1100
01:33:54,060 --> 01:34:02,690
There was a silence, then the deep, amused
voice of a man said, "Who's here?"

1101
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:07,320
He looked down at his strange visitor, then
called into the house.

1102
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:11,300
"Come here a minute, dear, and look at this!"

1103
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:20,050
The warm voice of a woman answered, and then
she stood next to the man at the open door.

1104
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:23,670
She looked down in surprise at the white dog
on the step.

1105
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:29,640
When he saw her smile, the old terrier gave
her his paw.

1106
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:33,000
She shook it, laughing quietly.

1107
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,600
Then she invited him into the house.

1108
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:42,210
The old dog walked in calmly and looked around
for food.

1109
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:49,370
He was lucky because this man and woman were
the kindest people in the neighborhood.

1110
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:51,720
Their house was the most welcoming.

1111
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:57,570
James and Nell Mackenzie lived alone in the
big farmhouse.

1112
01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:03,740
Their eight children were adults now and lived
away from home.

1113
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:09,010
Nell gave their visitor a bowl of food and
he ate it quickly.

1114
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,920
Then he looked up for more.

1115
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,090
"He's very hungry!"

1116
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:17,070
she said, and gave him her breakfast.

1117
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:21,980
He ate that almost before it reached the ground.

1118
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:27,270
Without a word James Mackenzie gave him his
plate of food, too.

1119
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:29,380
And some milk.

1120
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:36,220
At last, warm and happy, the old dog lay down
in front of the fire while Nell cooked another

1121
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,330
breakfast.

1122
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:40,430
"What type of dog is he?"

1123
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:41,430
she asked.

1124
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:44,110
"I've never seen anything so friendly.

1125
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:46,450
But he's ugly, too!"

1126
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:50,550
"He's an English bull terrier," said her husband.

1127
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:52,790
"I love them.

1128
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:56,430
He's about ten or eleven years old.

1129
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,862
And I think he's been in a fight."

1130
01:35:57,862 --> 01:36:05,090
The old dog listened and wagged his tail from
side to side.

1131
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:08,470
Then he got up and put his head on Mackenzie's
knee.

1132
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:11,330
"You are friendly, aren't you?

1133
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:15,130
But what are we going to do with you?"

1134
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:19,550
Nell touched the dog's shoulder and then looked
at him more closely.

1135
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:23,910
"He hasn't been in a dog fight," she said.

1136
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:27,480
"He's had a fight with a bear!"

1137
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:32,660
In silence they looked down at the dog by
their feet.

1138
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:36,320
They could see now that he was exhausted.

1139
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:41,020
He had a look of sadness in his little eyes
and he was too thin.

1140
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:49,420
This wasn't a brave adventurer'only a tired
old dog, hungry for food and love.

1141
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:54,400
"We'll keep him if he wants to stay," Nell
said.

1142
01:36:54,400 --> 01:37:00,140
"I'll tell the police when I go into Deepwater,"
said Mackenzie.

1143
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:05,220
"Maybe we can write something about the dog
for the city newspaper too.

1144
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:10,300
If nobody wants him, he can live with us."

1145
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:16,470
After breakfast Mackenzie went down to a small
lake to do some hunting.

1146
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:20,600
Six birds flew into the air and he shot at
them twice.

1147
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:26,940
One bird fell into the water and another on
the ground near the lake.

1148
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:34,320
He picked one up and then, to his surprise,
saw the large head of a dog in the lake!

1149
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,380
It was swimming toward the dead bird!

1150
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:45,210
The Labrador caught the bird, swam out of
the water with it, and brought it to the man.

1151
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:47,360
Mackenzie couldn't believe it.

1152
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:52,450
"Good dog!" he said quietly, holding out one
hand.

1153
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:53,620
"Well done!

1154
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,410
Now give it to me."

1155
01:37:56,410 --> 01:38:01,370
The dog walked slowly toward the man and put
down the bird.

1156
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:06,990
Mackenzie saw that he was in great pain and
needed help.

1157
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:12,550
He picked up the bird and said, "Follow me,"
to the Labrador.

1158
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:17,130
The dog walked behind him back to the farmhouse.

1159
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:22,910
He was too weak to worry about human beings.

1160
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:28,430
Crossing the fields with the dog at his side,
Mackenzie thought about the other dog.

1161
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:32,961
How many more were there in the neighborhood?

1162
01:38:32,961 --> 01:38:39,550
"Maybe another one will come to the kitchen
door this afternoon!" he laughed to himself.

1163
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:46,320
As Mackenzie passed one of the farm buildings,
a sleepy Siamese cat looked up.

1164
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:51,800
The farmer didn't see him, but the young dog
wagged his tail and turned his head.

1165
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:59,070
In the kitchen, the man looked in the Labrador's
mouth and carefully cleaned his bad tooth.

1166
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:04,270
Then he gave him some medicine to help the
pain.

1167
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:08,650
While Mackenzie was helping Luath, the terrier
watched closely.

1168
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:14,150
He didn't want the man to hurt his dear friend.

1169
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:18,380
After about an hour, the Labrador looked much
better.

1170
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:23,610
The old dog sat next to him as he drank a
bowl of milk.

1171
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:30,020
It was clear to the Mackenzies that the two
dogs came from the same home.

1172
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:34,570
But they couldn't understand why the animals
weren't with their family.

1173
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:39,410
"What are they doing out in this wild country?"

1174
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,420
Nell asked.

1175
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:47,460
"Maybe their master's died," Mackenzie answered,
"and they've run away together.

1176
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:53,040
Or maybe they were in a car with someone but
got lost.

1177
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,290
You can see that they've been away from home
a long time.

1178
01:39:57,290 --> 01:39:58,840
And they've been very hungry.

1179
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,640
How did they find enough food to stay alive?"

1180
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,290
"Hunting?

1181
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:06,420
Stealing maybe?"

1182
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,420
Nell suggested.

1183
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:13,250
"I saw the old dog take some food off a plate
on the table after breakfast!"

1184
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:19,630
"So they didn't eat much in the forest," said
her husband thoughtfully.

1185
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:22,030
"The Labrador's very thin.

1186
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:28,260
I'll shut them in one of the farm buildings
outside when I go to Deepwater, Nell.

1187
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:30,190
We don't want them to run away.

1188
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:34,840
Now, are you sure you want these two strange
dogs?"

1189
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,680
"I want them," she said, "if they'll stay.

1190
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:41,630
But we must think of names for them.

1191
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:44,450
We can't say 'good dog' all the time.

1192
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:51,920
I'll think of some names while you're in Deepwater."

1193
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:57,860
Mackenzie crossed the yard with the two dogs
and put them in one of the warm, sweet-smelling

1194
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:59,620
farm buildings.

1195
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:03,260
Then he shut the door carefully behind him.

1196
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,220
The cat sat in the sun and watched.

1197
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:11,630
Soon Mackenzie drove away and everything was
quiet again.

1198
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:16,280
A few curious farm cats came to look at Tao.

1199
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:20,880
Who was this stranger in their favorite place
in the sun?

1200
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:26,360
Tao didn't like other cats and watched them
coldly.

1201
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:34,460
After two or three small fights, the farm
cats walked away and Tao went back to sleep.

1202
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:39,310
Halfway through the morning, he woke up and
walked toward the farm building.

1203
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:44,150
He skillfully opened the door with his paws
and walked in.

1204
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:51,150
His old friends welcomed him loudly and followed
him into the sunny yard.

1205
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:56,510
When Mackenzie drove into the yard later in
the afternoon, he was surprised to see the

1206
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:58,680
two dogs outside in the sun.

1207
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:02,090
They stood up when they saw him.

1208
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:06,290
Then, with wagging tails, they followed him
into the house.

1209
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:10,450
"Did you let them out into the yard, Nell?"
he asked.

1210
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:13,440
"Of course not," she answered in surprise.

1211
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:19,400
"I took them some milk, but I shut the door
carefully after me."

1212
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,460
"That's strange.

1213
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:25,000
Were lucky they're still here," said Mackenzie.

1214
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,250
"The Labrador looks much better.

1215
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,030
He'll be able to eat a good meal this evening.

1216
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:34,610
I'd like to see him fatter.

1217
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:37,840
Nobody knew about the dogs in Deepwater.

1218
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:45,130
But they came from the east because somebody
in a town to the east saw them on his doorstep.

1219
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:49,200
Maybe the Labrador was on a hunting trip and
got lost.

1220
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,590
But what about the bull terrier?

1221
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:54,780
Why is he with the young dog?

1222
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:58,570
If we don't want the dogs, somebody in Deepwater
will take them."

1223
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:00,320
"No they won't!"

1224
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,340
Nell said.

1225
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:04,180
"All right," her husband agreed, laughing.

1226
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:07,910
"We'll keep them as long as we can, dear.

1227
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:13,810
But if they're going somewhere with a purpose,
Nell, nothing will keep them here.

1228
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:16,000
We can feed them well.

1229
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,290
Then, if they leave, they'll have a better
start."

1230
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:27,650
After supper that night the Mackenzies and
their guests moved into the little back room.

1231
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:36,110
It was warm and comfortable, with children's
books, pictures, and photos of the family.

1232
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:39,400
Mackenzie sat at the table, smoking his pipe.

1233
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,590
His wife read a book.

1234
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:47,240
The Labrador lay under the table in a deep
sleep, warm and safe.

1235
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,240
The terrier slept near him on an old sofa.

1236
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:57,790
The only sound during the evening was the
noise of a huge cat fight out in the yard.

1237
01:43:57,790 --> 01:44:01,760
Both dogs sat up immediately, wagging their
tails.

1238
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,880
"They look very interested," said Nell to
her husband.

1239
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:12,290
Later, the dogs followed Mackenzie out to
the farm building.

1240
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:16,510
He filled a bowl with water, then shut the
door behind him.

1241
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:21,010
A few minutes later, the lights in the house
went out.

1242
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:26,630
The dogs lay quietly in the darkness, waiting.

1243
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:31,200
Soon they heard the soft sound of paws on
wood, and the door opened.

1244
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:38,050
The cat walked in and lay down next to the
old dog's chest.

1245
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:39,290
Then there was silence in the building.

1246
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:45,700
The young dog woke up in the cold early morning.

1247
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:49,880
He knew that they had to start their journey
to the west again.

1248
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:52,780
The cat joined him at the door.

1249
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:57,460
Then the old dog came, shaking in the cold
wind.

1250
01:44:57,460 --> 01:45:01,690
For a few minutes they sat there quietly,
listening.

1251
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:05,670
They could hear some of the farm animals moving.

1252
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:08,380
They looked across the dark yard.

1253
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:14,530
Then they silently crossed it, went into the
fields, and started to walk west.

1254
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:20,120
In front of them lay the last eighty kilometers
of their journey.

1255
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,361
This country was more dangerous and lonely
than before.

1256
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:33,030
And the young dog was already sick and weak.

1257
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:36,610
CHAPTER TEN
The Search Begins

1258
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:47,150
In twenty-four hours he must tell the Hunters
the terrible news about their lost pets.

1259
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:51,190
And he had no idea where they were!

1260
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:58,180
The Hunter family were on their way home from
England.

1261
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:02,660
The children, Peter and Elizabeth, were very
excited.

1262
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:11,190
They wanted to see their home and friends
again and, of course, their wonderful pets.

1263
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:17,800
Every day Elizabeth said to her mother, "I
hope Tao hasn't forgotten me."

1264
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:22,560
She had a special present from England for
him.

1265
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,580
Peter wasn't worried about seeing Bodger again.

1266
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:29,440
He knew that his old terrier couldn't forget
him.

1267
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:33,400
Their father was excited, too.

1268
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,620
He wanted to see Luath again and go hunting
with him.

1269
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:44,590
Far away in Ontario, John Longridge returned
from his vacation to an empty house.

1270
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:52,580
He looked for the animals everywhere: in the
house, in the yard, in the fields.

1271
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:56,880
He called and called, but there was no answer.

1272
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,030
Mrs. Oakes didn't know where they were either.

1273
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:07,710
She showed Longridge the first page of his
note to her and the burnt second page.

1274
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:12,790
"I only read the first page," said Mrs. Oakes.

1275
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:17,840
"I thought the animals were with you at Heron
Lake."

1276
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:23,270
"No, the animals have disappeared," Longridge
said sadly.

1277
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,390
"But they were happy here.

1278
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:26,390
Why did they leave?"

1279
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:27,390
"And why didn't anybody see them?" asked Mrs.
Oakes sadly.

1280
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:28,390
"I don't know.

1281
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:29,390
I've spoken to some of Bodger's friends at
the school.

1282
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:30,390
None of the children saw the dogs or the cat
on the day I left for my vacation.

1283
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:31,390
And the police don't know anything either."

1284
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:32,390
Longridge went to sit down at his desk.

1285
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:33,390
He read a letter from Elizabeth again.

1286
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:34,390
She was excited about seeing Tao, and the
dogs.

1287
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:35,390
In twenty-four hours he must tell the Hunters
the terrible news about their lost pets.

1288
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,390
And he had no idea where they were!

1289
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:37,390
He pressed his aching head into his hands
and tried to think clearly.

1290
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:38,390
Animals didn't just disappear.

1291
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:39,390
Then he remembered Luath on the last morning...

1292
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,390
his eyes...

1293
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:41,390
Something was different...

1294
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:42,390
lifting up his paw.

1295
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,390
Suddenly, he understood!

1296
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:44,390
"Mrs. Oakes!" he shouted.

1297
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:45,390
"I know what's happened!

1298
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:46,390
I know where they've gone!

1299
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:47,390
Luath's taken them home!

1300
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:48,390
He's taken them all back to their home!"

1301
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:49,390
Mrs. Oakes looked at him in silence for a
minute.

1302
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:50,390
Then she cried out, "No!

1303
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:51,390
It's not possible!

1304
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,390
The Hunters live more than four hundred kilometers
away!

1305
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:53,390
And nobody's seen them..."

1306
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:54,390
"There aren't many people if you go straight
across country, over the Ironmouth mountains,"

1307
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:55,390
said Longridge thoughtfully.

1308
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:56,390
"Over the Ironmouth?"

1309
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,390
Mrs. Oakes said.

1310
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:58,390
"If you're right, then there's no hope.

1311
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:59,390
There are bears and other wild animals over
there, and no food..."

1312
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:00,390
"Maybe a hunter or somebody has helped them,"
said Longridge when he saw Mrs. Oakes's sad

1313
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,390
face.

1314
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:02,390
"No, Mr. Longridge, it's impossible.

1315
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:03,390
A young dog could cross that country, and
possibly a cat.

1316
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:04,390
A cat can look after itself.

1317
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:05,390
But old Bodger couldn't walk ten kilometers!

1318
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:06,390
No dog as old as Bodger could live more than
a day or two in that wild country.

1319
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:07,390
And that's a fact."

1320
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:08,390
They both looked out of the window at the
dark.

1321
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:09,390
"You're right, Mrs. Oakes," said Longridge
in an exhausted voice.

1322
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:10,390
"They left almost three weeks ago.

1323
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:11,390
I'm sure our old friend Bodger is dead.

1324
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:12,390
And Tao, too,

1325
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:13,390
maybe.

1326
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:14,390
Siamese cats hate the cold.

1327
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:15,390
But a big, strong dog like Luath may still
be alive."

1328
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,390
"That Luath!" said Mrs. Oakes angrily.

1329
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:17,390
"Why did Bodger follow him to his death?

1330
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,390
And why didn't Tao stop Luath?

1331
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:19,390
Poor old Bodger."

1332
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:20,390
She left the room quickly and shut the door.

1333
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:21,390
Longridge knew that she was crying about the
animals.

1334
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:22,390
With no time to lose, he phoned the police.

1335
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:23,390
"I'm sure the animals are trying to get home,"
he told him.

1336
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:24,390
"Can you ask everyone in the area to look
for them?"

1337
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,390
"Yes, of course, Mr. Longridge," the officer
replied.

1338
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:26,390
"Everybody will help.

1339
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:27,390
But we can't do anything until tomorrow morning."

1340
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:28,390
Longridge found a map of the area and drew
a line between his small town and the Hunters'

1341
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:29,390
town.

1342
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:30,390
The line passed through hills, woods, and
lakes, but not through many towns.

1343
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:31,390
The last seventy or eighty kilometers looked
very wild and dangerous.

1344
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:32,390
Longridge felt less and less hopeful as he
looked at the map.

1345
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:33,390
"Why did I offer to take the animals when
the Hunters went to England?" he thought to

1346
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:34,390
himself.

1347
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:35,390
"Now they're dead, because of me.

1348
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:36,390
And tomorrow Elizabeth and Peter are coming
home..."

1349
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:37,390
Later that night the telephone rang.

1350
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:38,390
It was a hunter in a place called Lintola.

1351
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:39,390
A little girl from the Nurmi family found
a Siamese cat in the river about two weeks

1352
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:40,390
ago, he told Longridge.

1353
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:41,390
"But it disappeared again a few days later."

1354
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:42,390
Thank you, said Longridge.

1355
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:43,390
"I'll phone Lintola tomorrow and try to speak
to the child."

1356
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:44,390
"There's some other news too," the man said.

1357
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:45,390
"But I don't know if it's useful.

1358
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,390
Old Jeremy Aubyn came into town and talked
about three visitors' to his house.

1359
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:47,390
He never has any visitors, poor old man.

1360
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:48,390
Maybe his visitors were animals, not people."

1361
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:49,390
Longridge thanked the man warmly, put down
the phone, and looked at Lintola on the map.

1362
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:50,390
"They are going home," he thought.

1363
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:51,390
"I was right.

1364
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,390
Two weeks ago the cat was alive.

1365
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:53,390
But what's happened to the other two?

1366
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,390
Are they dead?"

1367
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:55,390
He lay awake in the dark that night, missing
the feeling of the old terrier's warm body

1368
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:56,390
next to him on the bed.

1369
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:57,390
"You can have the bed if you come back, Bodger,"
he thought.

1370
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:58,390
"I'll sleep on the floor.

1371
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:59,390
But please, come back!"

1372
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,390
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Coming Home

1373
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:01,390
"They can't be alive now," Jim Hunter told
his family sadly.

1374
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:02,390
"But I hope their incredible journey ended
quickly and without pain."

1375
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:03,390
In the following week Longridge's telephone
never stopped ringing.

1376
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,390
Some of the news was difficult to believe.

1377
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:05,390
Some of it was hopeful.

1378
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:06,390
Longridge listened to it all patiently.

1379
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:07,390
"Every man, woman, or child has seen a cat
or dog on the road," said Longridge, exhausted,

1380
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:08,390
on the phone to Jim Hunter.

1381
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:09,390
"And they're all ringing to tell us!"

1382
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:10,390
"Yes, but they're all trying to be helpful
and kind," said Jim Hunter.

1383
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:11,390
"And some of them really did see our dear
pets."

1384
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:12,390
"We know from these phone calls that I was
right," Longridge said to his friend.

1385
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:13,390
"The animals are traveling west along the
line of my map.

1386
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:14,390
The little girl, Helvi Nurmi, looked after
Tao for a short time.

1387
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:15,390
And a man saw two dogs in the Ironmouth mountains.

1388
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:16,390
And a farmer saw an old white dog who was
stealing one of his chickens!"

1389
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:17,390
Peter smiled for the first time when he heard
this.

1390
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:18,390
He could see Bodger enjoying himself in a
fight.

1391
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:19,390
But he knew that his old dog was really dead.

1392
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:20,390
And Luath.

1393
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:21,390
Elizabeth was different from her brother.

1394
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:22,390
She was sure that Tao was alive.

1395
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:23,390
"He'll come home soon," she told her family.

1396
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,390
"I don't believe that he's dead.

1397
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,390
You'll see."

1398
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:26,390
But only Elizabeth was hopeful.

1399
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:27,390
Longridge and the rest of the Hunter family
looked at the map: the animals were in wild,

1400
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:28,390
lonely country.

1401
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:29,390
"They can't be alive now," Jim Hunter told
his family sadly.

1402
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:30,390
"But I hope their incredible journey ended
quickly and without pain."

1403
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,390
Some weeks later, Longridge visited the Hunters
again.

1404
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:32,390
People continued to ring about the animals,
but there was no good news.

1405
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,390
It was Peter's twelfth birthday the following
Sunday.

1406
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:34,390
"Let's all go to Lake Windigo for a short
vacation," Longridge suggested to the family.

1407
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:35,390
"But maybe Tao will come back when we're away,"
said Elizabeth.

1408
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:36,390
Longridge showed her Lake Windigo on the map.

1409
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:37,390
"It's on the line I drew," he told her.

1410
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:38,390
Elizabeth agreed, full of hope.

1411
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:39,390
So they left for Lake Windigo to stay in the
Hunters' small cabin there.

1412
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:40,390
It was almost winter and the lake was cold.

1413
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:41,390
There were no boats and all the other cabins
were empty.

1414
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:42,390
Peter had a new camera and he went into the
woods for hours with it.

1415
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:43,390
Elizabeth played in a treehouse near the lake.

1416
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:44,390
On the last afternoon, the Sunday of Peter's
birthday, they decided to go for a long walk.

1417
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:45,390
It was a beautiful, clear day and they walked
in friendly silence.

1418
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:46,390
Each person was quietly thinking to himself.

1419
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:47,390
Jim Hunter missed his dog.

1420
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:48,390
He remembered walking with Luath on other
fall days, gun in hand.

1421
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:49,390
And he remembered hunting with Luath on lakes,
waiting patiently for hours in boats with

1422
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:50,390
him.

1423
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:51,390
Peter remembered his last birthday as he walked
up the hill.

1424
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:52,390
"Do you remember Bodger last year, Dad?" he
asked his father.

1425
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:53,390
"I tried to teach him to hunt, but he didn't
enjoy it.

1426
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:54,390
He soon got bored, poor old Bodger."

1427
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,390
Peter suddenly felt very lonely and started
crying quietly.

1428
01:49:55,390 --> 01:49:56,390
But he didn't want his family to see, so he
quickly picked up his camera.

1429
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,390
They sat for a long time on the rocks at the
top of the hill.

1430
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:58,390
It was very quiet.

1431
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,390
A bird sang and another bird ate some of their
cookies.

1432
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:00,390
Everyone was silent and busy with their thoughts.

1433
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:01,390
Suddenly, Elizabeth stood up.

1434
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:02,390
"Listen!"

1435
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:03,390
she said.

1436
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:04,390
"Listen, Daddy!

1437
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,390
There's a dog barking!"

1438
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,390
Everyone listened, but no one heard anything.

1439
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:07,390
"You're imagining things," said her mother.

1440
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:08,390
"Or maybe it was another animal.

1441
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:09,390
We must go back now."

1442
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:10,390
"Wait, wait!

1443
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,390
You'll hear it in a minute, too," said Elizabeth
quietly.

1444
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:12,390
Her mother remembered that the child's hearing
was still very good.

1445
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:13,390
She could hear noises that were lost to adults
forever.

1446
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:14,390
And now even to Peter.

1447
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:15,390
So she stayed silent.

1448
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:16,390
Elizabeth's excited, listening face changed
to a huge smile.

1449
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,390
"It's Luath!"

1450
01:50:17,390 --> 01:50:18,390
she said.

1451
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:19,390
"I know that bark!"

1452
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:20,390
"Don't do this, Liz," said her father.

1453
01:50:20,390 --> 01:50:21,390
"It's..."

1454
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:22,390
Now Peter thought he heard something, too.

1455
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:23,390
"Shhh!" he said to his father.

1456
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,390
There was silence again as everyone listened
hard.

1457
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:25,390
Jim Hunter felt strangely nervous.

1458
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:26,390
He got up and hurried down the hill with Peter
behind him.

1459
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:27,390
Then they both heard the bark.

1460
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:28,390
They stood there in the quiet afternoon, waiting
to welcome an exhausted traveler.

1461
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:29,390
They didn't have to wait long.

1462
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:30,390
A small body with a chocolate-colored tail
came running through the trees on the high

1463
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:31,390
hillside.

1464
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:32,390
With a welcoming cry the Siamese jumped down
the last two meters and landed at their feet.

1465
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:33,390
Elizabeth was smiling all over her face now.

1466
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:34,390
She got down on her knees and picked up the
excited cat.

1467
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:35,390
"Oh, Tao!" she said softly as she took him
in her arms.

1468
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:36,390
He put his brown paws lovingly around her
neck.

1469
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:37,390
"Tao!" she said again, kissing him.

1470
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,390
And Tao tightened his paws around her neck.

1471
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:39,390
A second later, the Labrador arrived.

1472
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:40,390
He was much thinner and weaker than before,
a shadow of the beautiful dog Longridge knew.

1473
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:41,390
He made excited noises as he jumped up to
his master.

1474
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:42,390
When Longridge saw his friend Jim's face,
he had to turn away.

1475
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:43,390
Minutes passed.

1476
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:44,390
Everyone started talking excitedly at the
same time.

1477
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:45,390
Luath barked and barked.

1478
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:46,390
He was shaking all over his body, and his
eyes never left his master's face.

1479
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:47,390
The cat, on Elizabeth's shoulder, joined in
with loud cries.

1480
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:48,390
Everyone laughed, talked, or cried at the
same time.

1481
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:49,390
There was a lot of noise in the quiet wood!

1482
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:50,390
Then, suddenly, there was silence.

1483
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:51,390
Everybody was thinking the same thought.

1484
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:52,390
No one looked at Peter.

1485
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:53,390
When Luath ran to him, he turned away.

1486
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:54,390
"I'm glad he's back, Dad," he said.

1487
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:55,390
"And your Tao, too!"

1488
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:56,390
he added to Elizabeth, with a difficult smile.

1489
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:57,390
Elizabeth, usually the happy one, started
to cry.

1490
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:58,390
Peter touched Tao behind the ears.

1491
01:50:58,390 --> 01:50:59,390
"You go back to the cabin," he said to his
family.

1492
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:00,390
"I want to go up the hill to take a photo..."

1493
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:01,390
"Shall I come too, Peter?"

1494
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:02,390
Longridge asked.

1495
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:03,390
And, to his surprise, the boy accepted his
offer.

1496
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:04,390
They watched the rest of the family walking
down the hill.

1497
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:05,390
Tao lay in Elizabeths arms and Luath walked
close behind his master.

1498
01:51:05,390 --> 01:51:06,390
Peter and Longridge returned to the top of
the hill to take some photos.

1499
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:07,390
And all the time they talked.

1500
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:08,390
About everything, but not about dogs.

1501
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:09,390
At last Longridge looked at his watch.

1502
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:10,390
It was time to go.

1503
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:11,390
He looked at Peter.

1504
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:12,390
"Let's..." he started to say.

1505
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:13,390
But he stopped when he saw the boy's excited
face.

1506
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,390
Down below, out of the darkness of the woods
and into the light of the sun, came Bodger!

1507
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:15,390
Thin and tired, hopeful, happy'and hungry.

1508
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:16,390
Bodger, the dear old terrier, was coming as
fast as he could!

1509
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:17,390
He started to run, faster and faster, and
threw himself at Peter.

1510
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,390
John Longridge turned away then and left them
in the private world of boy and dog.

1511
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:19,390
He started walking toward the lake when he
suddenly saw a small animal in front of him.

1512
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:20,390
It ran past his legs and its long tail disappeared
up the hill in a second.

1513
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:21,390
It was Tao, returning for his old friend.

1514
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,390
They were ending their incredible journey
together.

1515
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:22,392
- THE END -
