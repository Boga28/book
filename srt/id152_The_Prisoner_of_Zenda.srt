CHAPTER ONE
Rassendylls and Elphbergs

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,120
'When are you going to do something, Rudolf?'

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,570
my sister-in-law asked me one day.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,210
'What do you mean, Rose?'

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,580
'When are you going to find some work?'

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,580
'Work!'

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,580
I replied.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,070
'I don't need to work.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,330
I'm a Rassendyll.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,450
My family is one of the best in England.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,449
I'm rich - I don't need to do anything.'

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,600
'Your brother works,' Rose reminded me crossly.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
'He works very hard.'

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,519
Just at that moment my brother Robert came
into the room.

15
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,329
He looked at his wife.

16
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,679
He could see that she was angry about something.

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,100
'What's wrong, dear?' he asked.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,890
'Rose is angry because I don't do anything,'
I explained.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,659
'I told her I don't need to work.

20
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,010
We Rassendylls don't need to do anything.'

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,670
I looked at my sister-in-law again.

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,550
She was looking at my red hair.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,070
'Perhaps she's also angry because I've got
red hair,' I joked.

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,130
Rose blushed.

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,140
'Don't be silly!'

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,140
she told me.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,450
'That's not your fault.

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:24,080
But all the same,' she went on, 'your red
hair does remind people of that story about

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,010
the Rassendylls.

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,520
It's a pity.'

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Robert smiled at me.

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,960
'Of course it's not his fault,' he said cheerfully.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,740
'He's got the nose as well,' he added thoughtfully.

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,540
'I like my nose, and J like my hair,' I told
them.

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,090
I turned to look at the picture of Countess
Amelia on the wall.

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,400
Rose saw where I was looking.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,450
She became angry again.

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,350
'That picture!'

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,950
she complained to Robert.

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,210
'People will never forget the story if you
don't take that picture down.'

41
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,690
'People will never forget the story while
Rudolf's here,' Robert said.

42
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,690
'Look at his red hair - and that nose!'

43
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,549
Then I decided to annoy Rose a little.

44
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:17,129
'Actually,' I said, 'I like being an Elphberg.'

45
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,239
'Rudolf!'

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,239
Rose cried.

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,980
'How can you say that?'

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm sure you want to know why Rose was so
angry about my red hair and my nose.

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,540
I'll tell you the whole story.

50
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,069
We Rassendylls are a very old family.

51
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,480
Old families have scandals, and we have a
very interesting one.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,310
It all happened a long time ago - in 1733.

53
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,139
The young prince of Ruritania came to England
that year.

54
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:56,180
Prince Rudolf Elphberg was a tall man, and
he had red hair and a long nose.

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,120
He was a dashing figure, and was popular everywhere
he went.

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,480
He was a good linguist, he could ride well,
and he was an excellent marksman and swordsman.

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,359
The Prince stayed in England for a long time,
and then something strange happened.

58
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,480
One day he fought a duel with an Englishman.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,349
The Englishman's name was James Rassendyll.

60
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,400
Rassendyll wounded the Prince.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,150
The Prince was not badly hurt, but he returned
to Ruritania after the duel.

62
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,870
A few months later James Rassendyll died.

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:45,510
His wife, the Countess Amelia, had a son who
was born after Rassendyll's death.

64
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,780
The baby looked exactly like Prince Elphberg.

65
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,659
He had red hair and a long nose.

66
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:59,400
Now everybody understood why Rassendyll and
the Prince had fought a duel!

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,279
Ever since that time, there have always been
some Rassendylls who have red hair and long

68
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,879
noses.

69
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,480
We call them 'Elphberg' Rassendylls.

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,540
I'm an 'Elphberg' Rassendyll myself, you see.

71
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,620
Rose did not like the old story of Countess
Amelia and the Prince of Ruritania.

72
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,500
It embarrassed her.

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,060
Almost as much as my Elphberg features embarrassed
her.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,320
She thought that my features showed the weakness
of character and the uselessness of my life.

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,220
However, I thought that I had learnt quite
a lot.

76
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,600
I spoke fluent German, my French was very
good, and my Italian was acceptable.

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,700
I was good enough with a pistol, but not excellent.

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,880
I could also ride any horse you gave me.

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,970
I started to think about Ruritania over the
next few days.

80
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,470
I thought about Countess Amelia and the Prince.

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,030
It was a romantic story.

82
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,470
I knew that the old King was dead.

83
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,540
His son, another Prince Rudolf, was going
to be the next King.

84
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,560
I decided to visit Ruritania.

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,880
I wanted to see the coronation of the young
Prince Rudolf.

86
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,150
I did not tell my brother Robert of my plan
to visit Ruritania.

87
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,570
I told him I was going to the Tyrol for a
short holiday.

88
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,630
I was very excited when I left England.

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:42,210
I did not know that I was going on a great
adventure - the greatest adventure of my life!

90
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,780
CHAPTER TWO
The Journey to Ruritania

91
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:53,080
I decided to stay in Paris for a night on
my way to Ruritania.

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,380
Paris is a lively city, and I enjoyed myself
a lot.

93
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,920
I spent the evening with two friends.

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,690
One of them, George, worked in the British
Embassy.

95
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,490
We were three young men, and we talked about
the beautiful women in Paris.

96
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,000
Somebody mentioned Antoinette De Mauban.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
'I've heard of her,' I said excitedly.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,170
'She's a famous beauty.

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,420
What does she look like?'

100
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,000
'She's the most wonderful woman in Paris,'
George told me.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
'You won't see her, I'm afraid,' he added.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,250
'She's leaving Paris tonight.'

103
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,260
He spoke quietly now.

104
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,420
'The Duke of Strelsau visited here in Paris,'
he said.

105
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,670
'Really,' I replied.

106
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,380
'I wonder I where she's going.'

107
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,250
I knew that the Duke of Strelsau was the half-brother
of Prince Rudolf of Ruritania.

108
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,970
Perhaps Antoinette De Mauban was going to
Ruritania as well!

109
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,750
George went to the railway station with me
the next day.

110
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,780
I did not tell him I was travelling to Ruritania
because I did not want anyone to know.

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,620
I told him I was going to Dresden.

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,770
There was a smartly dressed lady on the platform
when we arrived.

113
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,810
'Excuse me, Rudolf,' he said.

114
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,970
'I know that lady.

115
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,060
I'll just go and say hello to her.

116
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,670
I won't be long.'

117
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,520
He went to talk to the lady.

118
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,990
He was smiling when he came back.

119
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,810
'You're in luck!' he joked.

120
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,250
'That's Antoinette De Mauban, and she's travelling
on your train.

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,430
She's going to Dresden as well.'

122
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:42,490
I did not see Antoinette De Mauban again until
the train arrived at Dresden.

123
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,950
I got off the train there because I wanted
to take the train for Ruritania.

124
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,120
Then I saw her!

125
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,310
Antoinette De Mauban got on the same train
as me.

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,300
She was travelling to Ruritania as well.

127
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,620
Perhaps she was going to visit the Duke of
Strelsau.

128
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,400
As soon as we reached the Ruritanian border,
I went to buy some newspapers and the officer

129
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,810
in charge of the customs house gave me such
a stare that I was surer than ever of my resemblance

130
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,920
to the Elphbergs.The train journey to Ruritania
was a long one.

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,630
I read some of the Ruritanian newspapers during
the journey.

132
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,060
There were lots of articles about Prince Rudolf
and the coronation.

133
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,330
The capital city, Strelsau, was full of people
who wanted to see the ceremony.

134
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,120
I did not want to stay in a crowded hotel,
so I decided not to go to Strelsau.

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,330
There is a little town called Zenda about
fifty miles from the capital.

136
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,410
I decided to stay there until the day of the
coronation.'I can travel into Strelsau every

137
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,340
day on the train,' I said to myself, i can
come back to Zenda every night.

138
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,940
It's not very far.'

139
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,970
I got off the train at Zenda.

140
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,190
There was a good hotel in the town.

141
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,170
I was comfortable there.

142
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,150
There was a lot of excitement in Zenda because
of the coronation.

143
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:24,330
Everybody was talking about Prince Rudolf
and his half-brother, the Duke of Strelsau.

144
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,750
I learned that the Duke owned the castle in
Zenda.

145
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,390
Everybody spoke very well about the Duke.

146
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,610
They made less friendly remarks about Prince
Rudolf.

147
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,690
He had spent a long time away from the country,
and very few people even knew what he looked

148
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,300
like.

149
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,060
I heard that he had also shaved off his famous
beard which made it even more difficult for

150
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,840
people to recognize him.

151
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,990
The old lady who owned the hotel was excited
about the coronation like everybody else.

152
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,330
'Prince Rudolf is here in Zenda!'

153
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,520
she told me.

154
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,250
'He's staying near the castle.

155
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,900
He'll travel from Zenda to Strelsau on the
day of the coronation.

156
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,150
Suddenly she looked very serious.

157
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,550
'It's a pity,' she told me.

158
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:24,649
'The Duke's a good man - he'd be a very good
king for Ruritania.

159
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:25,649
Prince Rudolf's'

160
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:26,649
-'Mother!'

161
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,060
one of the old lady's daughters cried.

162
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
She was angry.

163
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,500
'The Duke's a bad man, you know that.

164
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,480
I want Prince Rudolf to be king.

165
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,200
He's a real Elphberg, with red hair and a
long nose.'

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,890
'Are the Prince and the Duke good friends?'

167
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,820
I asked the old lady.

168
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,270
'No,' the old lady's daughter said.

169
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,110
'They hate each other really.

170
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,800
They're both in love with the same girl, Princess
Flavia.'

171
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
'Be quiet!'

172
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,220
the old lady commanded her.

173
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,480
She turned to me with a smile.

174
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,770
'You mustn't take what she says seriously,
sir,' she told me.

175
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,520
'The Duke and the Prince are the best of friends.

176
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,740
The Duke is helping the Prince to prepare
for the coronation.'

177
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,540
'You know that's not true!'

178
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,680
the old lady's daughter interrupted once again.

179
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,490
'The Duke hates Prince Rudolf.

180
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,910
Black Michael -'

181
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,550
The door of the room opened and a man came
in.

182
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,490
He looked very angrily at the girl.

183
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,140
'I've told you before not to call him 'Black
Michael',' he shouted angrily.

184
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,400
'He's the Duke of Strelsau!'

185
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,900
The man saw me in the room now and he was
suddenly silent.

186
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,300
He seemed shocked for a moment.

187
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,990
The old lady explained who I was.

188
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,630
'This is Mr. Rassendyll,' she said.

189
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,890
'He's come from England to see the Prince's
coronation.'

190
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,860
She turned politely to me.

191
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,240
'This is Johann,' she said.

192
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,960
'Fie works for the Duke of Strelsau.'

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,590
The man was still silent.

194
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,960
He stared at me in a very strange way.

195
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,050
I did not understand what was troubling him.

196
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,390
The girl began to laugh.

197
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,649
'You've got red hair, sir,' she said to me.

198
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,190
'He doesn't like red hair.

199
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,720
It's the Prince's colour, you see.'

200
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,120
The man laughed.

201
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,380
'I'm sorry, sir,' he said.

202
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
'You look -'

203
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,670
He was silent again and then he said, 'You
surprised me.

204
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:42,120
I didn't know anyone was staying in the hotel.'

205
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,240
CHAPTER THREE
The Cousins Rudolf

206
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,400
I went for a walk in the forest the next morning.

207
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,750
I walked near the castle.

208
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,680
The old part was very imposing and still in
good condition.

209
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,649
I noticed that it stood on an island, and
there was a moat full of water surrounding

210
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,029
it.

211
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,839
The water looked deep and cold.

212
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,980
On the other side of the moat there was an
elegant modern chateau, the country home of

213
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,020
the Duke of Strelsau.

214
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,310
I walked for a long time.

215
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,060
I decided to lie down and rest for a while.

216
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,190
I fell asleep in the forest.

217
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,990
I dreamt I was married to Princess Flavia
and we lived in the castle of Zenda.

218
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,899
I was about to kiss the Princess when I heard
someone say, 'This man looks just like the

219
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,270
Prince except for his beard.'

220
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:47,150
I opened my eyes and saw two men looking at
me with great curiosity.

221
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,190
Then the other man said, 'He's the same height
as the Prince, as well.

222
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,080
Really, it's very odd!'

223
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,990
I stood up now and looked at the two men.

224
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,460
One of them was quite an old man.

225
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,670
He had a square head and a grey moustache,
and he looked serious.

226
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,350
The other one was young.

227
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,820
He had dark skin, and he seemed friendlier
than the older man.

228
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,970
The young man smiled at me.

229
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,770
'What's your name?' he asked politely.

230
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,560
'Rassendyll' I told him.

231
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,470
'Rudolf Rassendyll.'

232
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,170
'I'm Fritz von Tarlenheim,' he said.

233
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,120
He pointed at the older man.

234
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,940
'And this is Colonel Sapt,' he told me.

235
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,600
'We work for the Prince.'

236
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,890
Colonel Sapt smiled at me now.

237
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,550
'So you're a Rassendyll,' he said happily.

238
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:49,870
'You know the old story about the Prince of
Ruritania and the Countess Amelia, I suppose?'

239
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,720
I smiled as well.

240
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,750
'I know the story very well,' I told him.

241
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,660
There was a noise behind some trees, and a
man began to shout.

242
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,180
'Fritz!

243
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,709
Fritz!

244
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,920
Where are you?'

245
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,010
'It's the Prince,' Fritz von Tarlenheim said.

246
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,050
'He's calling me.'

247
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,420
Now the man came forward.

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,589
I looked at him in great surprise.

249
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,810
He looked at me in great surprise.

250
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:29,620
Prince Rudolf of Ruritania and Rudolf Rassendyll
looked the same - except for my beard.

251
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,990
I studied the Prince carefully.

252
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,860
The likeness was remarkable.

253
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,399
He was a little shorter than me, and his face
was a little fatter than mine.

254
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,220
I also noticed that his mouth did not look
as determined as mine.

255
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,200
But for all that, we were nearly identical!

256
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,680
For a moment no one spoke.

257
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,720
Then the Prince turned to Fritz and Colonel
Sapt.

258
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Colonel Sapt whispered something in the Prince's
ear.

259
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,550
The Prince listened carefully, and then he
began to smile.

260
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,480
Suddenly he laughed very loudly.

261
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,680
'We're cousins!' he said to me.

262
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,399
I'm very pleased to know you, cousin,' he
added.

263
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,649
'Come and dine with me tonight.

264
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,950
We'll talk of old times together.

265
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,430
And you will stay at my house tonight, of
course.'

266
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,340
Colonel Sapt stepped forward to speak to the
Prince again.

267
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,480
He spoke seriously.

268
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,220
'The coronation is tomorrow morning, sir,'
he said.

269
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,390
'There is a lot to do before then.

270
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,690
We have a lot of things to talk about.

271
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,000
It's not the evening for a dinner with Mr.
Rassendyll.'

272
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,370
Prince Rudolf looked angrily at Colonel Sapt.

273
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,640
He did not seem pleased with the Colonel's
advice.

274
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,490
'I want to dine with Mr. Rassendyll!' he said
crossly, i want to drink wine with him.

275
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,839
He's my cousin - and I don't meet a new cousin
every day.

276
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,920
That is how I came to dine with Prince Rudolf.

277
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,700
We ate well, and we drank a lot of wine.

278
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,170
Prince Rudolf drank more wine than anyone
else.

279
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,699
He was very happy because of the wine.

280
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,720
It was a long dinner.

281
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,980
I thought the evening was finished, but I
was wrong.

282
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,770
The servant, Joseph, brought another bottle
of wine to the table.

283
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,970
'This bottle comes from the Duke of Strelsau,'
he told Prince Rudolf.

284
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,660
'He told me to give you this message: "Drink
this wine because you love me."

285
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,290
That's what he told me to say, sir.'

286
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,240
'What a good brother Michael is!'

287
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,530
Prince Rudolf cried joyfully.

288
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,880
'I'll certainly drink his wine.'

289
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,370
He reached for the bottle and poured a glass
of the wine.

290
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,950
He drank the glass quickly.

291
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,060
Then he put his head on the table and fell
asleep.

292
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,550
Nobody else touched the wine from the Duke
of Strelsau.

293
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,640
I looked at Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel
Sapt.

294
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,460
I did not say anything, but the Prince of
Ruritania was a disappointment to me.

295
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:27,080
He seemed a selfish young man - a selfish
young man who was too fond of wine.

296
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,720
I remember nothing else about that evening.

297
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,640
I, too, had drunk too much wine.

298
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,740
I fell asleep at the table.

299
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,480
CHAPTER FOUR
The Game Begins

300
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,570
I woke suddenly the next morning.

301
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,950
Someone had thrown water over me!

302
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,150
I opened my eyes angrily and looked up at
Fritz and the Colonel.

303
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,820
'That wasn't a good joke!'

304
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,040
I said angrily.

305
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,620
'Be quiet,' Colonel Sapt ordered angrily.

306
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,610
'We had to wake you up.

307
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,970
There's something wrong.'

308
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,160
He pointed to the floor.

309
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,890
The Prince was lying there.

310
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,630
'The Prince is still sleeping.

311
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,380
We've tried to wake him, but we can't.'

312
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,730
'We think the Duke put something in that bottle
of wine,' Fritz explained.

313
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,270
'Something that will make the Prince sleep
all day.'

314
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,560
'It's a crisis for Ruritania,' Colonel Sapt
said.

315
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,170
'The coronation is this morning.

316
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:38,210
If Prince Rudolf does not go to Strelsau today,
he'll never be king!'

317
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,940
'What do you mean?'

318
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
I asked.

319
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,200
'The Duke wants to be king,' Colonel Sapt
told me.

320
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,059
'Prince Rudolf is not popular.

321
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,890
I think the Duke will seize the crown!'

322
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,640
'What are you going to do about it?'

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,140
I asked him.

324
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,570
'There's only one chance,' Colonel Sapt explained.

325
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,450
'The coronation is today.

326
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,419
Prince Rudolf must go to Strelsau this morning!'

327
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,710
'But if he's asleep - ' I began.

328
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,470
'You can go,' Colonel Sapt said.

329
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,910
'You can be Prince Rudolf for the day.'

330
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,910
'Me!'

331
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,960
I cried.

332
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,809
'But that's ridiculous.

333
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,380
I don't know how to behave like a prince.

334
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,740
I can't pretend to be the Prince of Ruritania!'

335
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,580
'You look like the Prince, except for your
beard,' Colonel Sapt said slowly.

336
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,600
'You can do it.

337
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,070
Rassendyll, I know you can.'

338
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,710
I did not say anything.

339
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:44,730
'If you don't do it, the Duke will be the
next King of Ruritania,' Colonel Sapt went

340
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,730
on.

341
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,080
'And he'll kill Prince Rudolf.'

342
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,750
Then I decided.

343
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,040
I was young and I liked excitement and adventure.

344
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,960
'Very well,' I told the Colonel.

345
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,860
'I'll help you.

346
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,770
I'll be the Prince for a day.'

347
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,179
'Well done!'

348
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,549
the Colonel cried excitedly.

349
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,630
He shook my hand.

350
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,610
'There's a lot to do.

351
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,350
Let's make a start.'

352
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,260
I got up and began to shave off my beard while
the Colonel told me his plan.

353
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,600
'I'll hide the Prince in the wine-cellar,'
he said excitedly.

354
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,700
'Then we all go to Strelsau together to the
coronation, and you become King.

355
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,240
Then we come back to Zenda.

356
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,480
We wake the real King.

357
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,530
He goes back to Strelsau with us the next
day.

358
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,680
And you, Mr. Rassendyll, you leave Ruritania
very secretly.'

359
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,300
He paused then he clapped his hands together.

360
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,360
'Yes!

361
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,780
It's a good plan,' he cried.

362
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,080
The Colonel picked up the Prince and carried
him to the door.

363
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,300
He was very strong.

364
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,500
He opened the door suddenly - and then stopped.

365
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,810
Johann's mother was standing on the other
side of the door.

366
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,630
'Was she listening?'

367
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,910
Fritz asked quickly.

368
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,090
'I'll make sure she's quiet!'

369
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:19,370
the Colonel said grimly.'The Colonel carried
the Prince into the wine cellar.

370
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,290
Then he came upstairs again and seized hold
of Johann's mother.

371
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,100
He put a handkerchief in her mouth and tied
her up.

372
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,260
Then he carried her down to a coal-cellar
and locked her in.

373
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,500
Then Colonel Sapt, Fritz and I continued to
make our plans.

374
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,880
'No one will ever know,' Fritz said.

375
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,350
'It'll work - and you'll save Ruritania from
disaster, Mr. Rassendyll.'

376
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:52,390
'All we've got to do is hide the real Prince
while we're all in Strelsau,' the Colonel

377
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,390
said.

378
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,020
'Fritz and I will do that while you're getting
ready, Mr. Rassendyll.

379
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,210
Joseph will guard him while we're away.'

380
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:09,940
Colonel Sapt hurried out of the room to make
all the arrangements with the servant.

381
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:16,230
CHAPTER FIVE
Coronation of a King

382
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,790
It was now six o'clock in the morning.

383
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,950
I dressed in one of Prince Rudolf's uniforms.

384
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,620
Colonel Sapt, Fritz and I took our horses
and rode towards Strelsau.

385
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,809
It was a beautiful ride that early morning,
and I will never forget it.

386
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:40,660
The Colonel gave me advice about how to behave
when we reached Strelsau.

387
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,000
He told me about the things that Prince Rudolf
liked, and the things he did not like.

388
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,870
'Don't worry,' he said.

389
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,080
I'll stand next to you all the time.

390
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,799
I'll tell you what to say.'

391
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,740
We reached the railway station at eight o'clock.

392
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,789
At nine - thirty we were in the capital city.

393
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:03,390
'Are you frightened?'

394
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,059
Colonel Sapt asked me.

395
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,370
'Don't worry about me,' I told him.

396
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,710
I'll manage.'

397
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,179
'I think you will,' the Colonel replied.

398
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,429
'You're a real Elphberg, Mr. Rassendyll.'

399
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,020
When we got off the train, the people surrounded
us.

400
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,730
They were excited to see their Prince in front
of them.

401
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,850
They began to cheer and shout.

402
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,780
Soon the station was full of noise and shouting.

403
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
A party of important people were waiting for
us.

404
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:41,500
The commander of the Ruritanian army, an important-looking
marshal, was also there with some soldiers.

405
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,790
We all rode towards the cathedral together.

406
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,539
First we rode through the new part of Strelsau.

407
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:55,120
The Colonel told me that the people in this
part of the city were loyal to Prince Rudolf.

408
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,710
They wanted him to be king.

409
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,410
The crowds in the street cheered as we rode
past.

410
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,380
Suddenly I looked up at one of the buildings.

411
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,669
Antoinette De Mauban was standing in the window
watching the procession.

412
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:13,810
For a moment I was very nervous.

413
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:20,430
I was sure she would recognize me and tell
everyone that I was not the real Prince.

414
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,480
She did not do anything, however.

415
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,250
Then we rode through the old part of the city.

416
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,559
The people in this part of Strelsau did not
like Prince Rudolf.

417
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,610
They wanted his brother, the Duke of Strelsau,
to be king.

418
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,730
The marshal made a sign to the soldiers who
were riding with us.

419
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,400
He wanted them to stay close to me.

420
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,070
He wanted them to protect me from the crowd.

421
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,850
I decided that a real prince would be a brave
man.

422
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,020
'Why did you tell the soldiers to ride close
to me?'

423
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,100
I asked the marshal.

424
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,299
'For your safety, sir,' the marshal replied.

425
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,419
I'm not afraid,' I told the marshal.

426
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,770
'I'll ride in front of the soldiers.

427
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,890
I'm not afraid of my own people!'

428
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,980
Colonel Sapt put a hand on my arm.

429
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,380
He did not like what I was doing.

430
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,440
'I'll ride in front,' I repeated.

431
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,270
'Tell the soldiers to go away, marshal.'

432
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,450
I rode out in front of the soldiers.

433
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,059
For a few moments I felt like a real king.

434
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:34,660
It was a wonderful feeling.

435
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,590
Soon we arrived at the cathedral.

436
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,430
It was a splendid building, and it was full
of people.

437
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:47,460
Everyone was wearing their best clothes for
the coronation of their king.

438
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,340
I do not remember much about the ceremony.

439
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,420
It was long, and Colonel Sapt stood very close
to me throughout it.

440
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,820
He whispered to me all the time, telling me
what to do.

441
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,230
I saw Prince Rudolf's brother, the Duke of
Strelsau, in the cathedral.

442
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,550
He was very surprised to see me - he looked
quite ill for a moment!

443
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,260
He looked at me as if he had seen a ghost.

444
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,480
I also saw a beautiful young woman.

445
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,120
Colonel Sapt told me she was Princess Flavia.

446
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,060
She was the most beautiful woman I had ever
seen.

447
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,190
She had the red hair of the Elphbergs.

448
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,539
The coronation was a great success.

449
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:39,460
No one recognized that I was not the real
Prince Rudolf.

450
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,010
When it was over Fritz, Colonel Sapt and I
went to the palace.

451
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,550
We laughed and joked together.

452
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:50,050
The day had gone well for us.

453
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,740
I did think about the real Prince Rudolf - or
King Rudolf, as he now was.

454
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,000
I wondered what he was doing.

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,179
CHAPTER SIX
Kingship and Love

456
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:13,100
Colonel Sapt and I waited in the palace until
very late that night.

457
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,280
We talked together about the ceremony, and
about the Duke of Strelsau.

458
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,820
'He's a dangerous man,' the Colonel told me.

459
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:28,110
'But we've defeated him this time - thanks
to you, Mr. Rassendyll.'

460
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,350
At last everyone was asleep.

461
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,980
We went outside to the stables.

462
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,990
We found our horses, and put on their saddles.

463
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,770
'Let's go,' the Colonel said quietly.

464
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,870
We jumped on the horses and rode out of the
palace grounds.

465
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,880
It was exciting to ride through the sleeping
city.

466
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,910
We rode all night on our way back to Zenda.

467
00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:00,900
Suddenly we heard two horses following us
in the darkness - the Duke and one of his

468
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,740
men!

469
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,820
We rode on very quickly and managed to lose
them at a cross-roads in a forest.

470
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,770
We arrived at Zenda very early in the morning.

471
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:20,230
We went straight to the house - and there
we found a terrible tragedy.

472
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,940
At first there seemed to be no one in the
house.

473
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,090
Then we saw some blood coming from under the
locked door of the wine - cellar, where we

474
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,900
had left the King.

475
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,799
Perhaps the King was dead!

476
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,870
We opened the door to the room.

477
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,780
The servant Joseph was lying there - he was
dead.

478
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,860
We looked everywhere for the King, but we
could not find him.

479
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,360
'The Duke of Strelsau!'

480
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,370
the Colonel said angrily.

481
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,140
'He's been here.'

482
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,120
He pointed at the body of the servant on the
floor.

483
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,490
'This is the Duke's work!' he exclaimed.

484
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,490
'But where's the King?'

485
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,530
I asked.

486
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,620
'Do you think the Duke has killed him, too?'

487
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,600
'No,' the Colonel replied.

488
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,990
'I think the King is a prisoner in his brother's
castle.'

489
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,120
'What do we do?'

490
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,039
I asked.

491
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,580
'Everything's changed now,' the Colonel said
thoughtfully.

492
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,909
'We must change our original plan.'

493
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:27,270
He thought for a moment.

494
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,580
'Ruritania needs her King,' he told me.

495
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,240
'You will have to be the King for a while
longer, Mr. Rassendyll.'

496
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,220
'You want me to go back to Strelsau?'

497
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,580
I asked.

498
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,620
'But what about the real King?

499
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,130
What will happen to him?'

500
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,590
'You're the only King we've got,' the Colonel
said grimly.

501
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,840
'Go back to Strelsau, Mr Rassendyll.

502
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,510
You are the King of Ruritania again.'

503
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,540
'But the Duke of Strelsau knows that I'm not
the real King,' I said.

504
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,570
'He knows I'm a fake!'

505
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,390
'That's true,' the Colonel admitted.

506
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:13,160
'He knows you're not the real King, because
the real King is his prisoner in the castle

507
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
here at Zenda.

508
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,780
But the Duke can't tell anyone that you're
a fake.

509
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,770
He can't tell anyone that the real King is
a prisoner, can he?'

510
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,690
I nodded my head.

511
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,570
The Colonel was right.

512
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,750
'Do you think the King is in danger?'

513
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
I asked.

514
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,150
'Will the Duke kill him?'

515
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,919
Colonel Sapt looked at me very seriously for
a moment.

516
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,600
The King's life is in great danger,' he said
slowly.

517
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,250
'The Duke has already killed once.

518
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,730
But if he does kill the King,' he went on,
'you'll have to stay here.

519
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,000
You're an Elphberg, after all!'

520
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,830
Colonel Sapt and I went outside to our horses.

521
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,360
We rode back to the capital.

522
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,470
No one saw us enter the palace.

523
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:13,690
The next day the Colonel and Fritz told me
more about the King.

524
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,850
'Do you remember Princess Flavia?'

525
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,279
the Colonel asked me.

526
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,350
'She was at the coronation.'

527
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,220
I remembered her very well.

528
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,660
She was the beautiful girl I had noticed in
the cathedral.

529
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,120
'The King's in love with her,' Colonel Sapt
told me.

530
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,200
'Princess Flavia is very popular with the
people.

531
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,220
Everyone hopes the King will marry her.'

532
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,370
Fritz looked impatiently at Colonel Sapt.

533
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,120
He was young and very loyal to the King.

534
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,779
He always wanted to be busy, to be doing something
to help the King.

535
00:32:53,779 --> 00:33:00,070
The older man was also very loyal to the King,
but he knew how to wait, how to be patient

536
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,980
until the time for action came.

537
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,760
'When are we going to rescue the King?' he
asked impatiently.

538
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,210
'We can't sit here in the palace forever,
Colonel!'

539
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,559
'We must be patient' Colonel Sapt told him.

540
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,660
'The Duke won't kill the King while Mr. Rassendyll
is here pretending to be the King.

541
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,289
He'll wait and see what we do.

542
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,800
We must wait, too'

543
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,190
'You know that some of the Six are here in
Strelsau?'

544
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,279
Fritz asked.

545
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,150
The Colonel nodded.

546
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,070
'Yes,' he replied.

547
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,330
'The Duke sent them here to spy on Mr. Rassendyll'

548
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,809
'Who are the Six?'

549
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:43,809
I said.

550
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:47,860
'They're the Duke's favorite soldiers' Fritz
told me.

551
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,920
'They're the most dangerous men in the country,
and they're very loyal to the Duke.

552
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,470
They do everything he tells them to.'

553
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,730
'Three of them are Ruritanians' the Colonel
explained.

554
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,620
'There's also a Frenchman, a Belgian and an
Englishman.

555
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,810
But the most dangerous of the Six is Rupert
Hentzau.'

556
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,400
The three of us talked for a long time.

557
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,990
Fritz and I wanted to do something to help
the King, but Colonel Sapt told us to be patient.

558
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,980
He said we could do nothing until we knew
what the Duke was planning.

559
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,679
'Be patient, my friends,' he said.

560
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,010
The time for action will come soon."

561
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,440
'Very well,' I agreed.

562
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,060
'We'll do nothing until you tell us, Colonel.

563
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,619
But meanwhile, I'm the King of Ruritania.

564
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,030
Let's enjoy ourselves this evening!'

565
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,450
We all went out that evening to visit Princess
Flavia.

566
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,790
Fritz told me that he was in love with one
of the Princess's ladies - in -waiting.

567
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,040
'Countess Helga is very beautiful,' he said.

568
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,580
'We'll see her when we arrive.'

569
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,210
Princess Flavia was very happy to see me.

570
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,960
She did not realize that I was not the real
King.

571
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,280
She seemed worried about something, though,
and I asked her what was the matter.

572
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,810
'It's your brother,' she said.

573
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,890
'I think Michael is dangerous.

574
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,900
Please be careful.

575
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,250
Your Majesty!'

576
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,560
'I'm not frightened of Michael,' I told her.

577
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,500
She looked at me very seriously.

578
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,530
'Your life is important to Ruritania,' she
told me.

579
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:40,050
'And to your friends, as well,' she added
with a tender look.

580
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,359
I began to fall in love with Princess Flavia
that evening.

581
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,089
It was difficult for me not to tell her the
truth.

582
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:52,830
I wanted to tell her who I really was.

583
00:35:52,830 --> 00:36:00,460
But I was playing a dangerous game - and the
King's life depended on me.

584
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,350
I kept silent.

585
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:12,359
CHAPTER SEVEN
A Dangerous Meeting

586
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:17,010
The next morning Colonel Sapt came into my
room at the palace.

587
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,350
He was carrying a letter for me.

588
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,150
He looked at the writing on the envelope before
he gave me the letter.

589
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,330
'From a woman, I think,' he said with a smile.

590
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,790
'I wonder who it is?'

591
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,580
At first I thought the letter was from Princess
Flavia.

592
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,630
I opened it excitedly and began to read.

593
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,270
'Your Majesty,

594
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,290
I have important news for the King.

595
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,270
Come to the old house in New Avenue tonight.

596
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,040
Do not come with anyone else.

597
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,890
Antoinette De Mauban'

598
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,640
I handed the letter to the Colonel.

599
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,780
He read it quickly.

600
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,640
'You can't go.' he decided.

601
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,589
'Antoinette De Mauban is a friend of the Duke's.

602
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,290
They want to catch you alone and kill you.'

603
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,430
'I must go,' I argued.

604
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,540
'She says she has important news.

605
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,970
Perhaps she wants to help us.'

606
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,900
'I forbid it,' the Colonel said angrily.

607
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,260
'The Duke's men will kill you if you go to
this meeting tonight.'

608
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,670
'I'm going,' I announced firmly.

609
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,670
'If you try to stop me, I'll go straight back
to England!'

610
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,730
Colonel Sapt looked at me in surprise.

611
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,330
He was beginning to understand me.

612
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,030
We Rassendylls can be very stubborn!

613
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:45,290
'All right,' he agreed at last, 'you can go
if you want to - but I'm going with you, Mr.

614
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,520
Rassendyll!'

615
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,850
The Colonel and I left the palace very secretly
that night.

616
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,560
We were both carrying pistols in our pockets.

617
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,320
We went to the old house in New Avenue and
I left Colonel Sapt at the gate.

618
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,540
I entered the grounds of the house, and saw
someone in the summerhouse.

619
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,250
I walked across the garden to the summerhouse.

620
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,119
Antoinette De Mauban turned to greet me when
I entered.

621
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,609
She was very pale and nervous.

622
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:22,050
'You're in danger, Mr. Rassendyll,' she told
me quickly.

623
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,560
'Michael forced me to write that letter to
you.

624
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,230
I didn't want to do it.

625
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,690
His men will be here in a few minutes.

626
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,170
They want to kill you.

627
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,500
Then they're going to say the King is dead.

628
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,820
They'll arrest all your friends, and Michael
will be the new King.

629
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,080
You must escape from here.

630
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,470
Go quickly!'

631
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,860
I did not move.

632
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,970
'Why are you telling me this?'

633
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,010
I asked her.

634
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,390
'Michael's your friend, isn't he?'

635
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,060
She looked at me unhappily.

636
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,650
'I love him,' she said sadly.

637
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:00,140
'But I know he'll marry Princess Flavia if
he becomes King.

638
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,690
That's why I'm helping you, Mr. Rassendyll.'

639
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,700
Suddenly I heard a noise outside in the garden.

640
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,100
I turned towards the door of the summerhouse
and locked it.

641
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:16,040
I could see three men standing outside in
the garden - three of theSix!

642
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,410
One of them began speaking softly in English.

643
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,000
It was the Duke's man, Detchard.

644
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,900
'We just want to talk,' he said.

645
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,770
'We've come from Duke Michael.

646
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,220
He wants to make you an offer, Mr. Rassendyll.'

647
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,420
'What kind of an offer?'

648
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
I asked.

649
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,390
'The Duke wants you out of the country,' the
man said.

650
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:46,760
'He'll give you fifty thousand pounds if you
leave Ruritania.'

651
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,150
Antoinette De Mauban moved close to me.

652
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,109
She put her hand on my arm.

653
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:56,690
'Don't trust them,' she whispered urgently.

654
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,710
I moved very quietly away from the door of
the summerhouse.

655
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,480
I picked up a small tea table.

656
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,460
'All right,' I called.

657
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,070
'I'm coming out now.'

658
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:13,589
I held the tea table in front of me and ran
out of the summerhouse into the garden.

659
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:17,920
I pushed two of the Duke's men onto the ground
as I ran past them.

660
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,119
Then I heard Detchard shouting.

661
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,430
He fired a pistol at me, but it missed.

662
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,470
I turned and fired my pistol.

663
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,030
He gave a cry of pain.

664
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,630
I continued running.

665
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,119
Colonel Sapt was waiting for me when I reached
the road.

666
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,030
'What happened?' he asked.

667
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,810
'I thought you were dead when I heard the
shooting.'

668
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,420
We went back to the palace.

669
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:53,190
When we arrived, I told him everything that
had happened in the summerhouse.

670
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,170
CHAPTER EIGHT
A King's Love

671
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,359
The days that followed were very difficult
for me.

672
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,400
I saw Princess Flavia very often.

673
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,790
Each time I saw her I loved her more.

674
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,410
She, too, seemed to love me more each time
we met.

675
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,420
I remember that there was a ball one night,
and I gave Princess Flavia a red rose.

676
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,740
I behaved like all young men when they are
in love.

677
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,160
'You're different, Rudolf,' she told me once.

678
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,970
'You changed when you became King.

679
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,700
You're a new man!'

680
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,260
I wanted to tell her who I really was.

681
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,180
I wanted to tell her that I was not the King
of Ruritania.

682
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:44,660
I wanted her to love Rudolf Rassendyll, not
the King of Ruritania!

683
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,320
Sometimes I imagined the future.

684
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,060
'Will I always have to pretend to be the King?

685
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,760
Will I marry Princess Flavia?

686
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,790
Will she become my queen?'

687
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,349
One day she and I were talking.

688
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:03,010
She said to me, 'You are the King.

689
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,390
Why can't you be an ordinary man?

690
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,960
Then I'd show you how much I love you!'

691
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,520
'Would you really love me if I were an ordinary
man, Princess?'

692
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,570
I asked.

693
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,900
'Do you love me that much?'

694
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,580
'Of course I do,' she said.

695
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,060
Her words made me very happy.

696
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,240
I decided that I could not go on lying to
her any more.

697
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,599
I loved her.

698
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:36,700
I wanted to tell her the whole truth about
myself and the King of Ruritania.

699
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,720
I decided to speak.

700
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,079
'Princess,' I began.

701
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,990
'I want to tell you something.

702
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,180
I am -'

703
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,490
Just at that moment the door of the room opened
and Colonel Sapt came in.

704
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,040
He looked angrily at me.

705
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,000
'Forgive me, sir,' he said.

706
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,870
'I need to talk to you about something important.'

707
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,000
'One moment, Princess,' I said.

708
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,850
I left the room and followed Colonel Sapt.

709
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,810
He was furious with me.

710
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,290
'I heard everything you said,' he told me.

711
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,970
'You were going to tell her the truth.

712
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,390
Be careful,' he warned me.

713
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,650
'The King's life is in your hands, Mr. Rassendyll.'

714
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:24,000
Princess Flavia was not the only person who
liked the new King.

715
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,900
The people seemed happy with me, as well.

716
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,630
I was becoming popular as the King of Ruritania.

717
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,100
I spoke about this to Colonel Sapt one evening
when we were alone together.

718
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,359
'You know, Colonel,' I said, 'I'm a good king.

719
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:41,839
The people like me.

720
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,240
I could stay here and pretend to be the King
forever.

721
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,390
No one could stop me.'

722
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,040
The Colonel smiled.

723
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
'It's true,' he agreed.

724
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,400
'No one could stop you.

725
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,730
But I know you're a man of honor, Mr. Rassendyll.

726
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,790
I know you'll help us to find the real King.

727
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,430
And then you'll have to leave the country.

728
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,420
There can't be two Rudolfs in Ruritania!'

729
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,000
I sighed deeply.

730
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,960
The Colonel was right.

731
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,430
'I promised to help the King,' I said, 'and
I will help him.

732
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,880
I'll help him even if - even if -'

733
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,250
'Even if the real King marries Princess Flavia?'

734
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,109
the Colonel asked gently.

735
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:28,359
'Even that,' I replied.

736
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:31,010
'The Princess will marry the King.

737
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,230
It's her duty, Colonel.

738
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:38,370
You know that.'

739
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,140
CHAPTER NINE
Return to Zenda

740
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:48,020
At last Colonel Sapt decided that the time
was right for rescuing the real King.

741
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,760
'We'll go to Zenda together,' the Colonel
explained.

742
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,599
'We'll tell everyone that we're going hunting
I there.

743
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,750
No one will suspect anything.'

744
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,180
We took ten soldiers with us.

745
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,000
The soldiers did not know the real truth.

746
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,010
They thought I was the King.

747
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,910
The Colonel told them I was in danger.

748
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,690
He said someone had tried to kill me in the
summerhouse in New Avenue.

749
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:20,349
We stayed in Zenda for a few days while the
Colonel made his plans to get inside the castle.

750
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:25,150
One afternoon I was sitting in the garden
of the house, when Rupert Hentzau rode up

751
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,240
to the house.

752
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,390
He waved at me and smiled cheerfully.

753
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,910
Then he got down from his horse and came into
the garden.

754
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,619
'I've come with another offer from the Duke,'
he said.

755
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:39,810
'I don't want to hear it,' I told him.

756
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,060
The Duke will give you one million crowns
if you leave Ruritania,' Rupert said.

757
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,380
'What do you say?'

758
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,090
'No,' I replied coldly.

759
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,730
'I thought you'd say that,' Rupert told me
with a smile.

760
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,930
'I told the Duke it was no good.

761
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:58,160
You're a gentleman, Mr. Rassendyll - but you're
a fool as well!'

762
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,390
I said nothing, and we looked at each other
for a few minutes in silence.

763
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,180
Then Rupert spoke again.

764
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,990
'Listen to me,' he said.

765
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,160
'You could really be the King of Ruritania,
if you want.

766
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,210
My friends and I will help you.

767
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,650
Being king is fun, isn't it, Mr Rassendyll?

768
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,670
And the King will marry Princess Flavia, won't
lie?'

769
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,329
I still said nothing.

770
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:24,080
'We'll help you, and you help us,' he went
on.

771
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,530
'I want to be the Duke of Strelsau.

772
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,329
I like the Duke's castle - and I like his
lady as well,' he laughed.

773
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,800
'Antoinette De Mauban's a beauty!'

774
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,260
No,' I said again.

775
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,710
'I promised to help the King - and I'll keep
my promise.'

776
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,120
'I like you, Rassendyll,' Rupert said.

777
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,770
He spoke in a friendly way.

778
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,020
'I don't want to be your enemy.

779
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,890
Shake my hand before I go.

780
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,670
You're a brave man.'

781
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,460
He put out his hand for me to shake.

782
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,300
He was smiling.

783
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,109
Suddenly he took out a dagger from his coat.

784
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:01,770
He stabbed me in the arm with the dagger.

785
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:07,140
I cried out in pain and the soldiers ran into
the garden.

786
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:15,260
Rupert Hentzau jumped onto his horse and rode
away.

787
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,260
The soldiers carried me into the house and
put me to bed.

788
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,520
My arm was very painful.

789
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,609
That evening Fritz came to the house to see
me.

790
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,590
He brought someone with him.

791
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:32,410
I recognized Johann, the old man from the
hotel in Zenda.

792
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,839
I remembered that Johann worked for the Duke
of Strelsau.

793
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,339
The three of us talked together, and Johann
agreed to work with us.

794
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:44,510
He knew the King was a prisoner in the castle.

795
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,540
He was afraid of the Duke, he told us.

796
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,400
Johann told us that the King was still alive
but he was very ill.

797
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,900
'He'll die soon,' Johann told us.

798
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,050
There are two secret rooms in the castle,'
he explained.

799
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,280
They're holding the King in one of the rooms.

800
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,770
Two members of the Six are in the other room.

801
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,780
The Duke has told them to kill the King if
anyone tries to rescue him.'

802
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,640
'What will they do with the King's body?'

803
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,750
I asked him.

804
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,280
'If they kill him, we'll find his body.

805
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,790
Everybody will know the Duke's a murderer
then.'

806
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,440
They've got a plan,' Johann told me.

807
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,030
'There's a metal pipe that goes from the room
where they're keeping him, down into the moat.

808
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:37,130
When they kill the King, they're going to
throw the body into the castle moat.

809
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:42,050
The Duke's men will slide down the pipe into
the moat and swim away.

810
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,390
There'll be no evidence of the murder.

811
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,320
No one will ever find the King's body.'

812
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,300
I knew that we had to do something to save
the King.

813
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,650
Suddenly I had an idea.

814
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,470
'Listen, Johann,' I said, 'I want you to help
us to enter the castle.

815
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,450
Will you do that?'

816
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,060
'Yes, sir,' the old man replied.

817
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,920
'Good,' I said.

818
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,829
'Open the castle gate tomorrow night at two
o'clock.'

819
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:11,660
'What do I do then?'

820
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,200
the old man asked nervously.

821
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,160
'Nothing,' I told him.

822
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,080
'Open the castle gate, and then go away.

823
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,359
Leave the castle.'

824
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,850
'Very well,' he agreed.

825
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,560
'I'll do it.'

826
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,940
I gave Johann a letter for Antoinette De Mauban.

827
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,440
I told her to make a noise at two o'clock
the next night.

828
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,310
I wanted her to shout for help.

829
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,170
I wanted the Duke to go to her room when she
cried for help.

830
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,710
Then we could enter the castle through the
gate.

831
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,079
The next night I hid near the castle and watched.

832
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:57,080
It was very dark, and the castle seemed huge
against the sky.

833
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,450
CHAPTER TEN
Rescue

834
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,920
When it was nearly two o'clock I entered the
castle moat.

835
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,710
The water was cold.

836
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,180
I swam to the metal pipe under the King's
cell.

837
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,450
It was very close to Antoinette De Mauban's
room in the castle.

838
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,240
I looked up at the castle.

839
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,270
There was a light in Antoinette De Mauban's
room.

840
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,320
There was a man in the room with her.

841
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,410
It was Rupert Hentzau.

842
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,980
They were arguing about something.

843
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,630
I saw Rupert approach her, and she walked
away from him.

844
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,160
I heard her say angrily, 'Never!

845
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,609
You're mad.'

846
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:37,060
'Forget Black Michael,' Rupert told her.

847
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,640
'I'm a better man than he is.'

848
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,660
He moved forward again and tried to kiss Antoinette
De Mauban.

849
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,339
She pushed him away angrily.

850
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:47,710
Then I heard someone come into the room.

851
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,800
It was the Duke!

852
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,869
'Leave us alone' he ordered Rupert.

853
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:55,450
Rupert smiled cruelly and left the room.

854
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,630
A few minutes later the Duke also left Antoinette
De Mauban's room.

855
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,660
The castle was now dark.

856
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,220
I was waiting for Johann to open the gate
when there was a terrible scream from Antoinette

857
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,880
De Mauban's room.

858
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,240
'Help, Michael!'

859
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,720
she cried, it's Hentzau, help me!'

860
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,290
I could not see anything, but I heard it all.

861
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,220
First there was the sound of a man running
towards Antoinette De Mauban's room - the

862
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,390
Duke.

863
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,000
Then I heard the noise of swords.

864
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,810
Rupert and the Duke were fighting.

865
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:36,530
One man called out in pain, and there was
silence.

866
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,390
The window opened, and I saw Rupert standing
there.

867
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:44,040
He had killed the Duke of Strelsau!

868
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,220
Then more men rushed into the room.

869
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,090
They attacked Rupert, but he jumped out of
the window into the castle moat.

870
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,890
One of the Duke's men tried to follow Rupert.

871
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,950
I grabbed him and killed him quickly and quietly.

872
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,990
Then I searched his body for the keys to the
King's cell.

873
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,240
I took the keys and opened the door that led
to the cell.

874
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,090
I was now outside the King's cell.

875
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,630
There were two men with the King.

876
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,310
They thought I was a friend.

877
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,380
They opened the cell door.

878
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,390
I ran in and attacked them.

879
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,550
I killed one of them immediately.

880
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,599
The other man, Detchard, ran towards the King
with his sword.

881
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,819
The King was weak and ill, and he stood in
one corner of the cell.

882
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:31,740
I attacked Detchard before he could kill the
King.

883
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,090
He was a good swordsman, and we fought for
a long time down there in the dark cell.

884
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:41,930
Detchard was stronger than me, and I was in
great danger.

885
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,770
Suddenly the King recognised who I was.

886
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,400
'Cousin Rudolf!' he cried.

887
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,720
'I'll help you.'

888
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,369
He ran forward and picked up a chair.

889
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,420
Then he pushed the chair against Detchard.

890
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,560
Detchard turned and wounded the King with
his sword.

891
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,460
The King fell to the floor.

892
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:06,880
Then Detchard turned back to me, but he slipped
on the blood from the King's wound.

893
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,480
I killed him as he fell.

894
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,520
The fight was over.

895
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,280
I helped the King to climb the steps into
the castle.

896
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,760
Then we saw a strange sight.

897
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,750
There was a group of the Duke's men standing
near Rupert Hentzau.

898
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,599
Colonel Sapt and our soldiers were approaching
Rupert from the other direction.

899
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,770
Rupert looked at both groups of enemies and
smiled.

900
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,060
He did not seem afraid of danger.

901
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,550
Then I saw Antoinette De Mauban.

902
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:43,490
She was standing in a door of the castle - and
she was pointing a pistol at Rupert.

903
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,490
She fired, but the bullet missed.

904
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:49,490
Rupert turned to her and smiled.

905
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:54,480
Then he looked once at the Duke's men and
once at Colonel Sapt and the soldiers.

906
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,710
He ran to the wall and jumped into the castle
moat once more.

907
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:07,069
I jumped in after him, but he was a good swimmer.

908
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:10,680
He swam to the other side quickly and climbed
out.

909
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,030
Then he began to run through the countryside.

910
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,190
I ran after him, but he was faster than me.

911
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,820
He suddenly turned to the right, and I could
not see.

912
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:24,430
Then I heard a scream - it was a woman's voice.

913
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,220
I ran as fast as I could towards the sound.

914
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,580
Then I saw Rupert.

915
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,180
He was pulling a young girl off her horse.

916
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,530
He pulled her to the ground, kissed her gently,
and jumped onto the horse.

917
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,650
He rode up to me.

918
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,110
'What happened in the castle?' he asked.

919
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,420
�eI killed three of your friends,' I told
him.

920
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,579
'And the King?' he asked.

921
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:52,250
'The King is hurt,' I replied sternly, 'but
I think he will live.

922
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,059
I killed your friend Detchard.'

923
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,130
'You're a fool!'

924
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,290
Rupert said in a friendly way.

925
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,360
'One more thing,' I told him.

926
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,330
'I saved your life.

927
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:07,240
I was behind you on the bridge with a pistol'

928
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,740
He looked at me in surprise.

929
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,190
'Now get off the horse' I said angrily.

930
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,849
'Come and fight me like a man.'

931
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:17,810
I ran towards him and hit him.

932
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,420
I was furious.

933
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,319
He defended himself, and I think he would
have killed me there and then, I except for

934
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,410
a sudden noise.

935
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,470
Someone was coming towards us on a horse.

936
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,210
I turned and saw that it was Fritz.

937
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,500
He was carrying a pistol.

938
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,200
Rupert looked at Fritz.

939
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,819
He stopped fighting me.

940
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:39,150
'Au revoir, Rassendyll,' he said.

941
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,000
Then he rode away laughing.

942
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,819
Back at the castle the King was now lying
in Black Michael's own room.

943
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:50,680
His men sent a message to Princess Flavia
that he was safe.

944
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,670
She now hurried to Zenda to see him.

945
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,760
The Princess immediately set out for Zenda
in her carriage.

946
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,030
She arrived just as Fritz and I were approaching
the castle.

947
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,010
Fritz gave me a sudden look.

948
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:08,180
I understood that Princess Flavia must not
see me.

949
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,619
I hid behind some bushes - near the road.

950
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:17,079
Just at that moment the young girl whose horse
Rupert had taken, came forward.

951
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:19,340
She ran up to Princess Flavia.

952
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,859
'The King is here, Princess!'

953
00:56:21,859 --> 00:56:22,859
she cried.

954
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,090
'In the bushes.'

955
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,470
'Nonsense' one of the soldiers told her.

956
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,809
'The King is in the castle.'

957
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:30,430
'He's here, I tell you!'

958
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,450
the girl cried.

959
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,960
'He's here with Count Fritz.'

960
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,260
'How can the King be in two places?'

961
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,589
Princess Flavia asked.

962
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:41,869
'Or are there two kings?'

963
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:44,170
Colonel Sapt now appeared.

964
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,420
He told the Princess that the King was in
the castle.

965
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,750
'But this girl says he's here, in the bushes,'
the Princess told him.

966
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,490
Colonel Sapt smiled at the girl.

967
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:03,349
'Every fine gentleman looks like a king to
a simple girl like her,' he said.

968
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:07,130
'I'll see this man,' the Princess decided.

969
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:11,770
'Then come alone,' Colonel Sapt advised her.

970
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:16,130
A few minutes later Princess Flavia and the
Colonel were standing over me.

971
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,940
'It is the King!'

972
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,980
she cried excitedly.

973
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,030
She moved forward to kiss me.

974
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,270
'It is not the King,' Colonel Sapt told her.

975
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:29,270
'You cannot kiss this man, Princess.'

976
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,220
'Of course lie's the King!'

977
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,950
Princess Flavia cried.

978
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,910
'It is the King's face - it is my love!'

979
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,270
'Your love.

980
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:44,880
Princess,' the Colonel said slowly, 'but he
is not the King.'

981
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,420
'Why do you let them torture me?'

982
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,599
the Princess asked me.

983
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,069
'Tell me what it means.'

984
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:56,390
I looked at her sadly for a moment, then I
spoke.

985
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,240
'I am not the King!'

986
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,040
I said sadly.

987
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,180
Epilogue

988
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,530
That night I went to see the King.

989
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,200
He thanked me for my loyalty.

990
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,380
'You have been a good and dear friend, cousin,'
he told me.

991
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,780
'I will try to be a good king.

992
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,809
You have shown me how a good king behaves.'

993
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:30,920
Fritz and I left the King.

994
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,020
Fritz seemed in a hurry, and he led me quickly
to another part of the building.

995
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,089
'Where are we going?'

996
00:58:37,089 --> 00:58:38,369
I asked him.

997
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:41,740
'We're going to see Princess Flavia,' he told
me.

998
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:46,830
'She heard that the King was here, and she
came to see him.'

999
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,079
He coughed awkwardly.

1000
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,910
'Colonel Sapt has told her everything.

1001
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,400
She knows who you are now, Mr. Rassendyll'

1002
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,120
'I see.'

1003
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:05,040
I said slowly, I wonder why she wants to see
me.'

1004
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,710
Fritz opened a door and pushed me into the
room.

1005
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,340
He did not enter.

1006
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:14,630
The room was dark, and at first I thought
I was alone.

1007
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:18,400
Then I saw the figure of a woman standing
near the window.

1008
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,320
I approached her.

1009
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,430
'Princess!'

1010
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,920
I said.

1011
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,670
I bowed very low to her.

1012
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,670
'No!'

1013
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:27,670
she cried.

1014
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:32,490
'You must not bow to me, Rudolf - you're the
man I love.'

1015
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,359
'I love you,' I told her.

1016
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:39,380
I love you with all my heart.'

1017
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,569
Princess Flavia looked at me tenderly, but
she did not say a word.

1018
00:59:44,569 --> 00:59:49,569
'Perhaps I was wrong to pretend to be the
King,' I said.

1019
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:55,000
'But I never lied about my love for you - never!'

1020
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,670
'You were very brave to do what you did,'
she told me.

1021
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,920
'You saved the real King, and you had to pretend
to me.

1022
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,210
I understand that.'

1023
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,781
'I nearly told you the truth,' I explained.

1024
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:10,480
'I wanted to, but the King's life was in danger.'

1025
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,230
'What will you do now?'

1026
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,730
she asked me.

1027
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:19,230
I'm going back to England tonight,' I said
quietly.

1028
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:23,200
'I have to leave Ruritania now that the real
King is safe.'

1029
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,869
'I want to come with you!'

1030
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,100
Princess Flavia said desperately.

1031
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,310
'Yes,' I said eagerly.

1032
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,790
'Come with me.

1033
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,599
We'll be happy together, Flavia!'

1034
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:41,580
She looked at me sadly, then she said gently,
'Love isn't the only thing, Rudolf.

1035
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,839
I also have my duty here in Ruritania.'

1036
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:47,230
'I know,' I replied.

1037
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,390
'I was wrong to ask you to come with me.'

1038
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,290
'I believe in love.

1039
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,400
Rudolf,' the Princess went on.

1040
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,540
'But I believe in honor, too.

1041
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,470
I know you believe in honor as well.

1042
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:04,550
You played this dangerous game because you
believe in honor.'

1043
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:08,109
'You're right,' I said.

1044
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:11,829
I felt that my heart was breaking.

1045
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:16,770
'You must stay here in Ruritania, and I must
go back to England.

1046
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,760
We'll never see each other again.'

1047
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:25,450
The Princess kissed me, and I held her in
my arms.

1048
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:30,059
It was the saddest moment of my life.

1049
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:35,420
A few minutes later I was outside the castle
with Fritz and Colonel Sapt.

1050
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,610
It was now early morning.

1051
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,630
We went to the railway station and waited
for the train.

1052
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,990
'We're tired,' I said.

1053
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:47,690
'But we played our part like men, didn't we,
my friends?'

1054
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:54,910
'We defeated the enemy and saved Ruritania,'
Sapt said proudly.

1055
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,020
Fritz shook my hand warmly.

1056
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:05,230
'The right man is not always the real king!'
he said.

1057
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:09,700
Soon the train arrived, and I found myself
an empty carriage.

1058
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:14,309
I looked out of the window to wave goodbye
to Fritz and Colonel Sapt.

1059
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:16,240
They both stood on the platform.

1060
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,849
They took their hats off their heads and bowed
to me with great respect.

1061
01:02:21,849 --> 01:02:44,990
They stood like that until the train was a
long way from the station.

1062
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:48,540
That was the end of my Ruritanian adventure.

1063
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:52,390
A few months later Princess Flavia married
the King.

1064
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,549
It was her duty.

1065
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:57,650
I settled into a quiet life in England.

1066
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,819
I never married.

1067
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:04,420
I often wonder what happened to Rupert Hentzau.

1068
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:10,190
Sometimes I think he will return to Ruritania
one day, and make more trouble for the King.

1069
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:15,510
Then, who knows, I will go back there to help
the Elphbergs again!

1070
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:19,240
I take a holiday in Dresden every year.

1071
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,640
I meet Fritz and his wife, the Countess Helga
there.

1072
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,470
We spend a few days together.

1073
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:32,040
Every year Fritz carries a little box with
him and gives it to me.

1074
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:41,940
There is a rose inside, and a note: "Rudolf
- Flavia - always".

1075
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:50,839
Fritz carries a similar little box back to
Ruritania with him after each holiday.

1076
01:03:50,839 --> 01:04:01,700
- THE END -
