1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,840
Escape

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,800
'I'm innocent! Why don't they believe me?'

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,400
'Five years! I must stay in this 
prison for five years! All I do  

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,320
is read. This is no life. I must get out of here.'

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,040
Suddenly the door opens.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,440
'Ah, Brown. How are you today? 
You like your book, I see.'

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,520
'It's a very beautiful day. Oh, I 
forget - you can't go out. Ha, ha, ha!'

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,480
'Why do you hate me? You don't know 
me. Why do you say these things?'

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,600
'You're a thief. Everybody hates thieves.'

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,760
'I'm not a thief. I'm an innocent man.'

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01,840
'You're not innocent. Why are you in prison? 
Can you answer that? Now, eat and be quiet.'

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,260
'I'm not hungry!'

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,840
Crash!

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,280
'Now, don't get angry, Brown.'

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,320
'- he guard's right - it is a 
beautiful day. I must escape. But how?'

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,560
'I want to be like that bird. 
He's free. He does what he likes.'

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,640
'Wait a minute. I've got an 
idea. I can be like that bird.'

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,840
'There's a photograph. It's in one of these books,  

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,440
and it shows the country near 
the prison. Where is it?'

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:43,920
'Yes! It's here. Here's the 
prison. And over here...'

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,600
'OK. Tomorrow I'm leaving.'

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,960
Slam!

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,800
The next day.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,674
'Good morning, Brown. It's another beautiful 
day. But you're in here. Ha, ha, ha!'

25
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:56,680
Clink!

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,880
The guard does not believe his eyes.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,904
'No! It can't be! Quick - 
sound the alarm. It's Brown...'

28
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:04,915
Ring! Ring!

29
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:07,080
'... He's not here!'

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,320
'Look everywhere. You must catch Brown. 
Find him and bring him to me. Do you hear?'

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,760
'Yes, sir. Right away sir.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,200
'This is Brown's cell. I want someone in it 
tonight. You or Brown. Do you understand?'

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,620
'Yes, sir.'

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,760
Ring!

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,840
'I'm not happy and he's in trouble.'

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,000
'He's not happy and I'm in trouble.'

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
But Brown is not free.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
'The guard never looks up here.'

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,320
'Now I must get out of here.'

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,200
'After him!'

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,080
'I must be quick. I'm not going back 
to prison. They must kill me first.'

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,560
'Be careful, Brown. Don't fall now.'

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,120
'I'm nearly there. But this isn't easy.'

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,040
'Don't be afraid, Brown... OK, here I go.'

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,480
Brown is high above the guards. He runs and jumps.

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,160
'We must stop him.'

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,080
'Where is he?'

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,520
'Can you see him?'

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,040
'Look everywhere and find him - fast.'

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,600
'Oh, it's a long way down.'

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
'Help!'

52
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,040
'Ouch! That hurts.'

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
'There's a ditch. I can get there.'

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
'What's that? Is it him? 
Turn your light that way.'

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,680
'Can they see me? Am I safe?'

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,440
The guards do not see Brown. 
He is safe - for now.'

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
'Perhaps it's an animal. 
I don't think it's Brown.'

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,200
'My foot hurts. I've got water in my shoes. 
I'm tired. But I'm not going back to prison.'

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,280
'The wood isn't far. It's safe 
there. They can't catch me now.'

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,920
Brown runs and runs until... he 
can't run anymore. Suddenly...

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,440
'Dogs. I can hear dogs.'

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,080
'Go on!'

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
'Where's Brown?'

64
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,160
'Get him!'

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,265
'Oh, no. The dogs are looking for me!'

66
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:15,280
Splash! Splash!

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
'How can I hide? Perhaps...'

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
A minute later.

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,440
'Where is he? The dogs don't know. 
Perhaps he's this way. Come with me.'

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,040
Brown is very tired.

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,920
'I want to sleep, but I can't now. I must go on.'

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,880
'It's getting dark. I can stop soon.'

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,000
'Ah this nice.'

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,800
'I need that bicycle. I am not a thief but...'

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,560
'Stop! That's my bicycle.'

76
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,120
'Sorry. I need it. Bye!'

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
Brown cycles for hours.

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:09,031
'Watch out! You...! The bicycle doesn't work now. 
I must stop. Where can I find somewhere to sleep?'

79
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:09,040
Moo! Moo!

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:18,840
'Shush. I'm not going to hurt you. I only need to 
sleep. Can I sleep here, please? I don't snore.'

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,320
Brown shuts his eyes - and sleeps.

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
'He does snore!'

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,480
There is a noise. Brown opens his eyes.

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,960
'What's that?'

85
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,200
'Come on then, Daisy. On your feet, Clover.'

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,160
'Good, I'm safe. The farmer's going away.'

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,640
'These are prison clothes. I 
need some different clothes.'

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,149
'Hey! What are you doing? Those aren't 
your clothes! Come back here. Thief! Stop!'

89
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:53,160
Bang! Bang!

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,480
'Get out of my way. Guards, dogs, 
and now farmers' wives. What next?'

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,000
'I hear something. I'm very close now. That  

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
plane's coming in to land. 
The airport's over there.'

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Brown arrives at the airport.

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,080
'The fence is high, but I can climb it.'

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,580
'Ow!'

96
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,080
Buzz!

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,280
An electric fence. I can't 
climb it. What do I do now?'

98
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,400
'I can climb this tree and get over 
that fence. But I must be careful.'

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,480
'Ten more minutes and I'm free. All I need is a  

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:41,120
big plane. There are a lot of 
planes. Which one do I want?'

101
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,940
'That's the one. There's lots of room for me.'

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,000
Screech!

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
'I need to eat. Pizza, I think! 
And some milk. Are you hungry?'

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,720
'Of course I am. I need three big pizzas. It's 
five hours before we land again, you know.'

105
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,720
'Quick, we've only got half 
an hour. What's that noise?'

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,000
'My stomach, I think. I'm very hungry.'

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
'I can get in here.'

108
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,720
'What a lot of boxes! They 
can't all go in that plane.'

109
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,360
'I'm free. I'm like that bird now.'

110
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
'Wait!'

111
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,240
'He's in there!'

112
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,480
Some time later.

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,680
'Another beautiful day, Brown. 
But not for you. Ha, ha, ha!'

114
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,320
'You can't escape, Brown. Nobody escapes from me.'

115
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,480
'Brown lies on the cold floor. He is hurt.'

116
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,320
'The guard's wrong. I must 
escape. I can't stay in here.'

117
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,800
'You can't keep me in here. I'm 
innocent. You wait and see...'

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:01,920
'Perhaps things aren't all bad. I'm alive. The sun 
shines. I hear the birds sing. I have my books.  

119
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Other people have a worse life than I
have...'

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,040
Brown looks out of his window for a long time.

121
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,320
Brown sees something move. It is a mole.

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:23,280
'Wait a minute! That mole's 
making a tunnel. I've got an idea.
