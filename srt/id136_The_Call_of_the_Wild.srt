CHAPTER ONE
The Southland

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,129
Buck did not read the newspapers.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:11,710
He did not know that there was trouble for
every big, strong dog in California.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,059
Men found a yellow metal called gold in the
Klondike.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,929
They needed big, strong dogs with furry coats
to work in the north.

6
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:24,080
Buck lived in a big house in the sunny Santa
Clara Valley.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,529
The house was called Judge Miller's Place.

8
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,119
Around the house there were big gardens, fruit
trees and horses.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,530
Buck was born here and now he was four years
old.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,900
There were other dogs too, but they were not
important.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,720
Buck was the king!

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,470
Judge Miller's Place was his.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,240
He swam and hunted with the Judge's sons.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,670
He walked with the Judge's daughters.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,900
He carried the Judge's grandsons on his back
and played with them.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,510
In the winter Buck sat at the Judge's feet
in front of the fire.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,140
Buck's father was a big St Bernard and his
mother was a Scottish sheepdog.

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,850
Buck weighed one hundred and forty pounds
arid he was a happy and handsome dog.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,950
In the fall of 1897 men from all over the
world went to the Klondike.

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,940
They wanted to find gold.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,330
But Buck did not read the newspapers.

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,970
Manuel was the gardener's helper, and he needed
money for his big family.

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,700
One evening the Judge was out of the house
and Manuel and Buck went for a walk.

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,550
No one saw them leave and only one man saw
them at the railway station.

25
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,730
The man talked to Manuel and gave him some
money.

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,630
Then Manuel tied a rope around Buck's neck.

27
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,810
Buck let Manuel put the rope around his neck
because he was his friend.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,640
But when the other man pulled the rope Buck
could not breathe.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,670
He was angry and he jumped at the man.

30
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,299
The man caught him and suddenly Buck was on
his back.

31
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,890
His tongue was out of his mouth and he was
unable to move.

32
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,010
In the past no one ever did this to him.

33
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,920
The two men put him on the train in the baggage
car.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,200
When Buck woke up the train was moving.

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
He was angry.

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,200
The man watched him but Buck was too quick.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,730
He bit the man's hand.

38
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,890
That evening the man took Buck to the backroom
of a saloon in San Francisco.

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,670
The saloon-keeper looked at his hand.

40
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,060
"I only got fifty dollars for it' the man
said.

41
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,280
"How much did the other man get?"

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,510
the saloon-keeper asked.

43
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,370
"A hundred dollars."

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,090
"That makes a hundred and fifty.

45
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,420
That's a good price for a dog like him.

46
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,170
Come on, help me put him into the crate."

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,480
Buck tried to attack the two men, but they
pulled the rope again and again.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,840
Buck suffered terribly.

49
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,390
His neck, throat and tongue hurt a lot.

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,810
The men took off the rope and threw him into
a crate.

51
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,989
Buck spent the night in the backroom of the
saloon.

52
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,020
He was very angry.

53
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,879
He could not understand why he was there.

54
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,150
What did these strange men want?

55
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,319
Why was he a prisoner in a crate?

56
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,849
Where was the Judge?

57
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,080
The next morning four men took the crate to
the railway station.

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,500
They put it on a train that was going to the
north.

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,930
For two days and two nights Buck did not eat
or drink.

60
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,940
He was confused and angry.

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,900
Men on the train laughed at him.

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,960
He threw himself against the crate.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,769
He growled and barked at the men.

64
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,720
Buck was very thirsty but he had no water.

65
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,989
His tongue and throat were very dry.

66
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,310
His eyes were red and his anger grew.

67
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,959
He was glad for one thing: the rope was off
his neck.

68
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,260
He did not want another rope around his neck.

69
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
 

70
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,890
CHAPTER TWO
The Northland

71
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,880
In Seattle four men carried the crate to a
garden with a high wall.

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,180
A fat man with a red sweater looked at him.

73
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,120
Buck threw himself against the crate.

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,930
He growled and barked.

75
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,210
The man brought a hatchet and a club.

76
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,780
"Are you going to take him out now?" asked
one of the men.

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,310
"Sure," the man said.

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,150
He hit the crate with a hatchet to open it.

79
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,440
The four men ran away.

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,620
They went to sit on the high wall to watch
the show.

81
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,300
Buck threw himself against the wood of the
crate.

82
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,650
He bit it and growled.

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,580
He wanted to get out.

84
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,470
The man with the hatchet opened the crate.

85
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,240
Then he put down the hatchet and took the
club.

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,970
Buck was really a red-eyed devil.

87
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,280
His hair stood up and his eyes were red with
anger.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,580
He jumped straight at the man and his mouth
was ready to bite.

89
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,780
At that moment the man hit him with the club.

90
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,460
He fell to the ground on his back.

91
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,990
This was the first time he was hit with a
club.

92
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,060
He did not understand.

93
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,889
He jumped at the man again.

94
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,300
And again the man hit him with the club.

95
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,630
He fell to the ground again.

96
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,400
This time Buck knew that it was the club.

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,020
But his anger was so great that he did not
stop.

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,250
He jumped at the man a dozen times.

99
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,800
And a dozen times the club hit him.

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,780
There was blood on his nose, mouth and ears.

101
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,560
Then the man hit him very hard on the nose.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,460
The pain was terrible.

103
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,470
It was agony.

104
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,000
Buck jumped at the man again and the man threw
him to the ground.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,340
Buck did not move for some time.

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,180
"He knows how to teach a dog a lesson," said
one of the four men.

107
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,770
Then they returned to the train station.

108
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,280
Buck slowly opened his eyes.

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,430
He could not move.

110
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,680
He watched the man in the red sweater.

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,870
The fat man was reading the saloon-keeper's
letter and said, "Your name is Buck.

112
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,340
Well, Buck," he said in a friendly voice,
"now you know your place.

113
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,460
Be a good dog and we will be friends.

114
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,570
Be a bad dog and I must use my club again.

115
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,570
Understand?"

116
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,949
As he spoke he touched Buck's head.

117
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,979
Buck was angry inside but he did not move.

118
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:45,240
When the man brought him water and meat, Buck
drank and ate.

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,060
He learned that a man with a club was stronger
than him.

120
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,240
He never forgot it.

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,300
Life was now fiercer.

122
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,320
Each day other dogs came.

123
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,710
The man in the red sweater hit many dogs.

124
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,090
Buck understood that a dog must obey a man
with a club: he was a master.

125
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,410
One dog did not obey and he was killed.

126
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,330
Men often came to talk to the man in the red
sweater.

127
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,240
When they paid money the men took one or more
of the dogs.

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,069
Those dogs never came back.

129
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,310
"Where did they go?"

130
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,600
Buck thought.

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,860
He was afraid of the future.

132
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,530
One day a short man came to look at Buck.

133
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,310
The man spoke bad English.

134
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,220
"That's a strong dog!

135
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,220
How much?"

136
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,710
"Three hundred dollars," said the man in the
red sweater.

137
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,560
"And it's a gift at that price."

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,250
Perrault smiled.

139
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,120
The price of dogs was high at that time.

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,699
Perrault knew dogs and he knew Buck was an
excellent dog.

141
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,550
Buck saw money pass between the two men.

142
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,860
He was not surprised when he and a Newfoundland
dog called Curly were taken away by the small

143
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,080
man.

144
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,259
He took them to a ship called the Narwhal.

145
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,639
From the ship he and Curly looked back at
Seattle.

146
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,340
It was the last time they saw the warm Southland.

147
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,849
Perrault took Buck and Curly to Francois.

148
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:27,759
Perrault was a French-Canadian, but Francois
was half-Indian and had very dark skin.

149
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,949
Buck did not like these men but he respected
them.

150
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,939
He learned that Perrault and Francois were
calm and fair.

151
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:38,360
They knew everything about dogs.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,729
There were two other dogs on the ship.

153
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,379
One was a big white dog called Spitz.

154
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,620
He seemed friendly but he was not honest.

155
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,739
He smiled when he tried to take Buck's food.

156
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,800
Francois was fast and hit Spitz.

157
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,579
From this moment Buck began to like him.

158
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,350
The other dog was called Dave.

159
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,720
He was unfriendly and always wanted to be
alone.

160
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,380
Dave ate and slept and was interested in nothing.

161
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,470
Day and night the ship sailed.

162
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:22,360
Every day was the same, but Buck noticed that
the weather was colder.

163
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,249
Finally one morning the Narwhal's engines
stopped.

164
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:30,140
Buck and the other dogs were excited.

165
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,110
Something was happening.

166
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,410
Francois leashed the dogs and took them outside.

167
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,410
At the first step "Buck's feet went down into
something white and soft.

168
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,250
He jumped back.

169
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,199
More of this white stuff was falling from
the sky and fell on Buck.

170
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:52,759
He shook himself but more fell on him.

171
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,059
He smelled it curiously, then tasted some
on his tongue.

172
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:02,959
It was like fire and the next moment it disappeared.

173
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,939
This confused him.

174
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,769
He tried it again with the same result.

175
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,550
People looked at him and laughed.

176
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:16,769
It was his first snow.

177
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,290
CHAPTER THREE
The Law of Club and Tana

178
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,019
Buck's first day at Dyea Beach was terrible.

179
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:31,589
What a change from his comfortable, happy
life with the Judge in the sunny Southland!

180
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,869
Here there was no peace or rest.

181
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:37,339
There was only confusion and noise.

182
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:42,920
There was danger everywhere because these
dogs and men were not city dogs and men.

183
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,649
They only knew the law of club and fang.

184
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,720
Buck never saw dogs like these.

185
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,439
They fought like wolves.

186
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,129
He learned this by watching Curly.

187
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,579
She wanted to make friends with a husky.

188
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:03,550
The husky jumped on Curly and he tore her
face from eye to mouth.

189
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,519
Wolves and huskies fight like this.

190
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,040
They attack and then jump away.

191
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,439
But this fight was not finished.

192
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:14,869
Thirty or forty huskies came and made a circle
around the fight.

193
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:18,970
Curly attacked her enemy but the husky bit
her again.

194
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,949
She fell to the ground and never stood up
again.

195
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:29,120
The other huskies moved in and suddenly she
was under them.

196
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Buck saw Spitz run away with his red tongue
out of his mouth.

197
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,829
He was laughing.

198
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,079
Curly was dead in the snow.

199
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,510
Her body was almost in pieces.

200
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,779
Buck often saw this scene in his dreams.

201
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,579
He understood that when a dog was injured,
that was the end.

202
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,720
Spitz laughed again and from that moment Buck
hated him.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,079
Soon Buck had another surprise.

204
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,589
Francois put a harness on him.

205
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,399
Buck remembered the harnesses on horses at
home.

206
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,299
So now he must work like a horse.

207
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:12,489
He must pull the sled to the forest to get
firewood.

208
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:17,759
He was offended, but he decided to work and
do his best.

209
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,239
He worked with Spitz and Dave, and learned
a lot from them.

210
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:29,249
He learned to stop when Francois said "ho",
and to go when he said "mush".

211
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,769
"Those three are very good dogs," Francois
told Perrault.

212
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,889
"Buck pulls well and learns quickly."

213
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:43,739
That afternoon Perrault bought two huskies
called Billee and Joe.

214
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,480
They were brothers.

215
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,850
Billee was very friendly but Joe was the opposite.

216
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,629
In the evening, Perrault bought another dog
called Solleks.

217
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,119
He was an old husky with only one eye.

218
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:02,389
He made no friends and wanted to be alone.

219
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:06,629
That night Buck had another problem.

220
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:07,910
Where could he sleep?

221
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,480
Francois and Perrault were in their tent.

222
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,970
When Buck tried to enter they shouted angrily
at him.

223
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,709
It was terribly cold and windy outside.

224
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,850
He tried to sleep in the snow.

225
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,639
But it was too cold.

226
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,209
Buck walked sadly around the tent.

227
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,329
He looked for the other dogs but he could
not find them.

228
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,139
Where were they?

229
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:34,959
Buck was very cold and unhappy.

230
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,290
He did not know what to do.

231
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,359
Suddenly he fell into a hole.

232
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:46,050
He felt something move and then heard a friendly
bark.

233
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,620
Under the snow, in the warm hole he saw Billee.

234
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,129
Billee licked Buck's face with his warm, wet
tongue.

235
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,139
Another lesson.

236
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,459
So that was how the dogs slept.

237
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:04,079
Buck chose a place and made a hole.

238
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,420
In a minute he was warm and asleep.

239
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,429
He slept well but had bad dreams.

240
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,579
The noises of the camp woke him up the next
morning.

241
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,100
"What did I say," Francois shouted to Perrault.

242
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,499
"That Buck learns quickly."

243
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,559
Perrault smiled.

244
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,519
He was a courier for the Canadian Government.

245
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,559
He transported important documents and he
needed the best dogs.

246
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,480
He bought three dogs that morning.

247
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,459
Now there were nine dogs in a harness and
they were going up the Dyea Canyon.

248
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,850
The work was hard but Buck liked it.

249
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,290
He was surprised that Dave and Solleks were
not bored now.

250
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,310
Pulling in a harness was their job and they
were happy.

251
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,489
All the dogs were alert and active.

252
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,240
Billee was the sled dog.

253
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,100
He was nearest to the sled.

254
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,629
Dave was in front of him.

255
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,160
Then there was Buck.

256
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,970
In front of them were the other dogs.

257
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,139
Spitz was the leader in front.

258
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,059
Dave and Solleks were Buck's teachers.

259
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:15,820
When Buck pulled the wrong way Dave always
bit his leg lightly.

260
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,660
Buck learned quickly.

261
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,579
It was a hard journey up the canyon, through
Sheep Camp and into the mountains.

262
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:29,489
That night they camped at Lake Bennett.

263
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,189
Thousands of gold miners were there.

264
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:37,660
Buck made his hole in the snow and slept well.

265
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,009
Very early the next morning Buck and his team
started pulling the sled again.

266
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,579
That day they traveled forty miles on a good
trail.

267
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:52,769
But the next day there was no trail.

268
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,329
The dogs worked harder and they traveled slowly.

269
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,120
Perrault usually went in front of the dogs.

270
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,519
With his snowshoes he made the snow flat.

271
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,699
Francois guided the sled from behind.

272
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,419
Perrault was in a hurry.

273
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,660
He knew all about ice and this was very important.

274
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,019
In the fall the ice was very thin.

275
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,589
Day after day Buck worked hard and pulled
the sled.

276
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:28,370
The dogs started before it was light and stopped
in the evening after dark.

277
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,779
They ate a piece of fish and went to sleep.

278
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,399
Buck was always hungry.

279
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,769
Everyday he ate a pound and a half of fish.

280
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,399
But it was never enough.

281
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,579
One day he saw another dog called Pike steal
meat from Perrault.

282
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,160
Buck did the same the next day and no one
saw him.

283
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,189
Buck was learning to live in the hostile Northland.

284
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:58,989
In the Southland he never stole but he was
never hungry.

285
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,970
In the Southland there was the law of love
and friendship.

286
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,370
The man with the red sweater taught him the
law of club and fang.

287
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,199
He learned to eat all kinds of food.

288
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,079
He learned to fight and became very clever.

289
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,980
He became stronger and more primitive.

290
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,130
The natural forces inside of him became alive.

291
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,000
It was easy for Buck to fight like a wolf
because it was in his blood.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,500
At night he looked at a star and howled, like
his ancestors did long ago.

293
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,480
Buck was following his instinct.

294
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,789
CHAPTER FOUR
The Attack

295
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:50,190
The primitive spirit of his ancestors was
strong in Buck.

296
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,309
And under the harsh conditions of is new life
this spirit grew.

297
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:01,250
He hated Spitz more and more, but he did not
want to start a fight.

298
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,120
Buck was careful, he did nothing without thinking.

299
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,950
Spitz always showed his teeth to Buck.

300
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,970
He wanted to start a fight.

301
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,660
Buck knew that a fight meant the death of
one or the other.

302
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,400
One night the fight almost happened.

303
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,880
They stopped at Lake Laberge.

304
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,309
It was snowing heavily and the wind was strong
and cold.

305
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,590
Perrault and Francois made a fire on the ice.

306
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,330
Buck made a hole in the snow.

307
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,730
It was warm and comfortable.

308
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,009
He did not want to leave it to get his piece
of fish.

309
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:43,750
When Buck finished eating the fish he went
back to his hole and found Spitz in it.

310
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,909
Buck did not want to fight with Spitz but
this was too much.

311
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,480
He jumped on Spitz with great anger.

312
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,570
Spitz was very surprised.

313
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,010
He knew Buck was big, but he did not know
he was so wild.

314
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,279
Francois was surprised too.

315
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,010
"A-a-ah!" he cried to Buck.

316
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,580
"Give it to him!

317
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,149
Give it to him!"

318
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:07,040
Both dogs wanted to fight.

319
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,190
They circled each other and waited for a chance
to jump in.

320
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:18,860
Suddenly Perrault shouted and they saw about
a hundred thin, hungry dogs.

321
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,520
They came from an Indian village and they
were looking for food.

322
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,809
Perrault and Francois hit them with their
clubs but the hungry dogs showed their teeth

323
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,269
and attacked.

324
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:35,100
One dog found the food box and in a moment
twenty dogs ate the bread and the meat.

325
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,650
The smell of food made them crazy.

326
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,410
The dogs looked like skeletons with wild eyes
and sharp fangs.

327
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,260
Three of them attacked Buck and bit his head
and shoulders.

328
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,809
Dave and Solleks fought courageously side
by side.

329
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,080
Joe attacked the dogs too.

330
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,669
Buck bit a dog in the neck and tasted its
blood.

331
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,110
The taste of blood made him fiercer.

332
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,149
He jumped on another dog and then felt teeth
in his own neck.

333
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:08,950
Spitz was attacking him from the side.

334
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,259
Perrault and Francois came with clubs to help
their dogs.

335
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:15,759
The hungry dogs ran away, but only for a moment.

336
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,590
When the two men ran back to save their food,
the dogs attacked again.

337
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,020
The terrible fight continued.

338
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,080
Later the nine team-dogs ran away and hid
in the forest.

339
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,610
They passed the night there.

340
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:38,940
Each dog was hurt in four or five places and
Joe lost his eye.

341
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,649
Early the next morning they slowly walked
back to camp.

342
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,430
Perrault and Francois were angry.

343
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,570
Half of their food was gone and one dog ate
Perrault's shoe.

344
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:57,120
Francois looked at the poor dogs and said,
"Ah, my friends, perhaps those bites will

345
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,590
make you crazy dogs.

346
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,590
What do you think, Perrault?"

347
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,679
Perrault said nothing.

348
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,530
There were four hundred miles between him
and Dawson.

349
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,639
He hoped his dogs were not crazy!

350
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:15,640
After two hours of hard work the team started
traveling.

351
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,990
The next part of the trail was the most difficult.

352
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,679
The Thirty Mile River was not frozen because
the water moved too quickly.

353
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,289
It took six days to travel those terrible
thirty miles.

354
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:34,960
They were terrible because every step was
dangerous for the dogs and the men.

355
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,910
They found twelve ice bridges across the river.

356
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,049
And Perrault fell through all of them!

357
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:44,700
His long stick saved him.

358
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,909
The temperature was 50 °F below zero.

359
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:56,289
Each time Perrault fell into the icy water
he built a fire to dry and warm himself.

360
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,370
Perrault was not afraid of anything.

361
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,669
This is why he was a government courier.

362
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,679
He was often in danger.

363
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,440
Once the sled with Buck and Dave fell through
the ice.

364
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,279
When Perrault and Francois pulled them out
of the river they were covered with ice.

365
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,279
The men built a fire to save the dogs.

366
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,059
When they arrived in Hootalinqua, Buck and
the other dogs were exhausted.

367
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,639
However, they were late and Perrault made
them run faster.

368
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:34,889
In three days they traveled one hundred and
ten miles and reached a place called Five

369
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:36,539
Fingers.

370
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,909
Buck's feet were not as hard as the feet of
the huskies.

371
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:44,330
His feet were still soft because of his comfortable
life with the Judge.

372
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,460
His feet hurt a lot all day.

373
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,620
That night at the camp he lay down like a
dead dog.

374
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,610
He was hungry but he could not walk to get
his fish.

375
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,140
So Francois brought it to him.

376
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,899
Every evening after dinner Francois massaged
Buck's feet for half an hour.

377
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:05,770
He made four little shoes for Buck.

378
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,320
Now Buck was more comfortable.

379
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,840
One morning Francois forgot the shoes and
Buck lay on his back with his feet in the

380
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,250
air.

381
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,470
He did not want to move without his shoes.

382
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:23,210
Later his feet grew hard and the shoes were
not necessary.

383
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,539
CHAPTER FIVE
The Big Fight

384
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:30,710
At Pelly River one morning Dolly suddenly
went crazy.

385
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,549
She howled like a wolf and then jumped at
Buck.

386
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,010
Buck knew this was something terrible and
ran away.

387
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,950
Dolly was behind him.

388
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,480
Buck was afraid.

389
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,139
He ran as fast as he could through the woods,
across the ice and back to the river.

390
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,850
Dolly was one step behind him.

391
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,070
Buck could hear her growling angrily.

392
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,080
"Buck!

393
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,090
Buck!"

394
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,679
Francois called.

395
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,770
"Francois can save me' Buck thought and ran
to him.

396
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,379
Francois had an axe ready in his hand.

397
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:08,120
As Buck ran past him the axe fell down on
Dolly's head.

398
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,390
Buck lay down near the sled.

399
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,440
He was exhausted.

400
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,009
This was Spitz's opportunity.

401
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:18,480
He jumped at Buck and bit him very hard.

402
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,179
Francois saw this and hit Spitz.

403
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,100
"That Spitz is a devil' said Perrault.

404
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,910
"Some day he will kill Buck."

405
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,500
"Buck is like two devils.

406
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
I know this for sure.

407
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,730
Some day Buck will get very angry and eat
up Spitz' Francois said.

408
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,850
From then on it was war between Spitz and
Buck.

409
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,470
Spitz was the lead-dog and master of the team.

410
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,059
Buck wanted to be the lead-dog.

411
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,370
It was part of his nature.

412
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,299
Spitz knew this and hated him.

413
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,749
Buck was dangerous because he was strong,
clever and patient.

414
00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:02,370
When the dogs made mistakes Buck protected
them from Spitz.

415
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:08,460
One morning Pike did not want to get up and
Spitz looked for him everywhere.

416
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,740
When he found Pike he jumped at him but Buck
suddenly attacked Spitz.

417
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,799
Francois whipped Buck with all his strength.

418
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,929
This did not stop Buck.

419
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,470
Francois whipped him again and again.

420
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,540
The other dogs saw this and it became difficult
for Spitz to lead them.

421
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,960
Day after day Buck protected the other dogs
from Spitz.

422
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,150
Buck did it "secretly when Francois was not
looking.

423
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,679
Things began to change on the team.

424
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,909
The dogs did not respect or obey Spitz.

425
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,570
The team became worse.

426
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,370
There was always more trouble and Buck was
responsible for it.

427
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,070
Francois was worried about Buck and Spitz.

428
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,970
"Those dogs will have a big fight one day,"
he thought.

429
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,409
But the days passed without a big fight.

430
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,390
They arrived in Dawson City on a cold gray
afternoon.

431
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,590
There were many men and dogs in Dawson.

432
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,350
The dogs did all kinds of work.

433
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,100
Buck met some Southland dogs but most of the
dogs were huskies.

434
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:23,549
At night there was the aurora borealis and
the stars danced in the sky.

435
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:32,039
Every night at nine o'clock, at twelve and
at three all the dogs howled together.

436
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,980
Buck liked to howl with them.

437
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,150
It was a strange song of the night from thousands
of years ago.

438
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,080
It was the song of Buck's ancestors.

439
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,960
It was about the difficulties of life.

440
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
They left Dawson after seven days.

441
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,870
Perrault had some important letters.

442
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,919
He wanted to return to Dyea as fast as possible.

443
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,610
The dogs were rested and in good condition.

444
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,309
On the first day they traveled fifty miles
and on the second day they were on the Yukon

445
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:07,730
River near Pelly.

446
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,580
Francois had many problems with the team.

447
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,490
The dogs did not work well together.

448
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,759
Buck and Spitz hated each other.

449
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,539
The other dogs did not respect Spitz.

450
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,259
They were not afraid of him anymore.

451
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:26,529
Francois often stopped the sled because the
dogs were fighting.

452
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,230
Francois knew that Buck caused the trouble.

453
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:35,289
But Buck was very clever and Francois never
saw him.

454
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:39,740
Buck worked hard and he loved pulling the
sled.

455
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,139
One night after dinner Dub found a snow rabbit.

456
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:47,399
In a moment all the dogs were running after
it.

457
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,090
Nearby there was a camp of the Northwest Police
with fifty dogs.

458
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,960
The fifty dogs started running after the rabbit
too.

459
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,410
The rabbit ran quickly on the soft snow, but
it was more difficult for the dogs.

460
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,530
Buck led the pack of sixty dogs and he was
very happy.

461
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,379
He was hunting his food and he felt alive.

462
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:14,059
His splendid body moved forward in the white
moonlight.

463
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,869
In the end Spitz caught the rabbit.

464
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:20,600
He broke its back with his teeth and threw
it in the air.

465
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,290
Buck attacked Spitz.

466
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,690
The dogs fell in the snow.

467
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,879
Spitz bit Buck twice and then jumped away.

468
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,390
He watched Buck carefully.

469
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,659
Buck knew this was the big fight.

470
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:36,210
Either he or Spitz must die.

471
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,090
Their ears went back and they growled angrily.

472
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,850
They watched each other carefully and they
circled slowly.

473
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:50,610
The night was silent and everything was white
in the moonlight.

474
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,860
The other dogs ate the rabbit and then turned
to watch the fight.

475
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,190
Spitz was a great fighter and he was intelligent.

476
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,990
Buck tried to bite his throat but Spitz always
defended himself.

477
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,789
Every time Buck attacked, Spitz moved away
and bit him on the side.

478
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,039
Soon Buck was covered with blood.

479
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,490
The fight was desperate.

480
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,720
But Buck had a good imagination.

481
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,640
He fought with his instinct but also with
his head.

482
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,669
Buck attacked again but at the last minute
he went under Spitz and bit his left leg.

483
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:30,919
The bone broke and Spitz stood on three legs.

484
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,539
Buck attacked three more times and then broke
his right leg.

485
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,590
There was no hope for Spitz now.

486
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,490
The silent circle of dogs moved closer to
Spitz.

487
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,700
They waited for the end.

488
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,039
Then Buck attacked again.

489
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,840
Spitz fell down on the snow.

490
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,929
He disappeared under the circle of the other
dogs.

491
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:55,570
Buck stood and watched.

492
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,110
He was the champion.

493
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:05,330
CHAPTER SIX
The New Lead

494
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,600
The next morning Francois could not find Spitz
and he saw Buck covered with blood.

495
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,369
"What did I say?

496
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:15,490
Buck is a great fighter!" said Francois .

497
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,279
Perrault looked at the wounds on Buck's body
and said, "That Spitz fought like a devil."

498
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,690
"And Buck fought like two devils," Francois
said.

499
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,740
"Now we can travel faster.

500
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,159
No more Spitz, no more trouble."

501
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,539
Francois started to harness the dogs.

502
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,390
Buck walked to Spitz's old position.

503
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,039
But Francois put Solleks in the lead position.

504
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,999
Buck jumped angrily at Solleks.

505
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:41,999
"Eh?"

506
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:42,999
Francois cried.

507
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:44,860
"Look at that Buck.

508
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,880
He killed Spitz and now he wants his place.

509
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,309
Go away, Buck."

510
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,520
But Buck did not move.

511
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,369
Solleks was not happy.

512
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:57,529
He was afraid of Buck.

513
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:02,600
When Francois turned his back Buck pushed
Solleks away.

514
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,090
Francois was angry.

515
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,749
"Now, I'll show you!"

516
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:09,020
He went to get a heavy club.

517
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,120
Buck remembered the man in the red sweater
and moved away.

518
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,529
"Come here, Buck," said Francois .

519
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:17,460
Buck did not obey.

520
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,749
He wanted to be the lead-dog because he won
the fight with Spitz.

521
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:25,659
The two men tried to put on the harness but
he always moved away.

522
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:28,850
"Come here, Buck," Perrault said.

523
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,690
But Buck did not move.

524
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,220
It was late.

525
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,840
Francois put Solleks in his old place.

526
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,210
Perrault looked at his watch and he was angry.

527
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,749
"Put down the club, Francois !"

528
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:46,850
Francois put down the club and Buck came to
the front of the team.

529
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:52,369
Francois put on the harness and the sled started
moving.

530
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,139
Buck was an excellent lead-dog.

531
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,549
He moved and thought quickly.

532
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,150
The other dogs worked harder with Buck.

533
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,480
The team traveled faster and faster.

534
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,679
"Buck is the best dog!

535
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,070
The very best!"

536
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,970
Francois said.

537
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,119
It was 45°F below zero.

538
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,940
Some days the dogs traveled sixty miles or
more.

539
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,909
After fourteen days they reached Skagway.

540
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:22,980
The dog team was the center of attention.

541
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,619
Then the two men received orders from the
Canadian government.

542
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:30,509
Francois put his arms around Buck and cried.

543
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:35,899
Then the two men left and Buck did not see
them again.

544
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:39,039
Another man took Buck and his team back to
Dawson.

545
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,970
The sled was very heavy because it carried
mail for the gold miners.

546
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,070
Buck did not like it, but he and the other
dogs worked hard.

547
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,820
It was not an interesting life.

548
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
One day was like another.

549
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,169
They started before it was light.

550
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:59,799
At night they camped arid this was the best
part of the day.

551
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:03,360
The dogs ate some fish and rested by the fire.

552
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,510
Buck loved to rest by the fire.

553
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,580
Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller's big
house and his life there.

554
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,619
He also thought about the man in the red sweater,
the death of Curly and the big fight with

555
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,249
Spitz.

556
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:25,340
Other times he remembered his parents, his
ancestors and the world of long ago.

557
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,029
The journey was hard and the mail was heavy.

558
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:31,530
The dogs were tired and weak.

559
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,759
They needed a long rest.

560
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,100
But after only two days they were traveling
again.

561
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,950
The dogs and the men were unhappy.

562
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,940
Each night the men took care of their dogs.

563
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,289
They looked at their feet but the dogs became
weaker every day.

564
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:51,019
Billee cried in his sleep and was very unfriendly.

565
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,720
Dave was tired and ill.

566
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,769
Something was wrong with him.

567
00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:00,830
When they stopped in the evening he lay down
and did not stand up until morning.

568
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,070
The men were worried about Dave.

569
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,100
They did not understand his illness.

570
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,040
One day Dave could not pull the sled anymore.

571
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,480
He cried sadly when Solleks took his place.

572
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,849
The next morning Dave could not move.

573
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,960
The driver took his pistol and walked away.

574
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,690
The dogs heard a shot.

575
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,050
The man came back quickly and the sled moved
again.

576
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,020
Buck and the other dogs knew what happened
to Dave.

577
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:38,179
Thirty days after leaving Dawson City the
team arrived in Skagway.

578
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,830
The dogs were exhausted and thin.

579
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,059
They needed a long rest.

580
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:46,409
The men needed new, strong dogs to pull the
sled.

581
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,829
They sold the old, tired dogs.

582
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:55,080
Two American men called Hal and Charles bought
Buck and his team.

583
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,000
They bought other dogs too.

584
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,540
Charles was forty years old and Hal was a
young man.

585
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,710
Charles' wife Mercedes was also with them.

586
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,430
They knew nothing about life in the Northland
and they made many mistakes.

587
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,950
They put too many things on their sled and
tried to start.

588
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,960
The dogs pulled hard for a few moments and
then stopped.

589
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,140
They could not move it because it was too
heavy.

590
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,070
"These lazy animals!"

591
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,250
cried Hal with a whip in his hand.

592
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,750
"They're very weak," said a man.

593
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,490
"They need a rest."

594
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,490
"Nonsense!

595
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,670
They're very lazy," said Hal.

596
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,920
"Mush!" he cried.

597
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,410
"Mush!"

598
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,680
Hal whipped the dogs again and again.

599
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,349
Another man said, "I don't care about you,
but I care about the dogs.

600
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:52,150
Break the ice around the sled, and then the
dogs can pull."

601
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,570
Hal broke the ice and the sled moved forward.

602
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,880
The unhappy team moved on.

603
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,760
Day after day Hal whipped the poor dogs.

604
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,210
He gave them little food to eat.

605
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,590
They were very tired and very hungry.

606
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,390
They looked like skeletons.

607
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,030
Dub hurt himself and was shot.

608
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,410
Billee and some other dogs died.

609
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:23,130
"Soon we will all die," Buck thought.

610
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,079
CHAPTER SEVEN
For the Love of a Man

611
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,470
Only five dogs reached John Thornton's camp:
Joe, Pike, Solleks, Teek and Buck.

612
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,990
They fell on the ground and could not move.

613
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,360
They were almost dead.

614
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,760
It was nearly the end of winter and it was
a beautiful day.

615
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,130
John Thornton was repairing an axe.

616
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,430
"Is it safe to cross the river here?"

617
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,460
asked Hal.

618
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,770
"Oh no, it's very dangerous.

619
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,500
The ice is too thin," answered Thornton.

620
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,520
Hal looked at him and said, "I don't believe
you.

621
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,200
We must go to Dawson."

622
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,910
He took his whip and cried, "Come on, Buck!

623
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,050
Let's go!"

624
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,370
Thornton knew these people were stupid and
did not understand.

625
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,839
The team did not move.

626
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,160
After a while Solleks slowly stood up.

627
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,440
Joe was crying but he stood up.

628
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,839
Pike tried twice and fell down.

629
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,260
The third time he stood up.

630
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,160
Buck did not try.

631
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,960
Hal whipped him but Buck did not move.

632
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,640
Thornton wanted to speak but he did not.

633
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,010
Hal was furious and took the club.

634
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,400
He hit Buck again and again.

635
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,400
But Buck did not want to stand up.

636
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,570
He had a strange feeling of doom.

637
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,460
He saw thin ice in front of him.

638
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,730
After so much suffering he did not feel the
club.

639
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,270
Then suddenly Thornton jumped on Hal and threw
him to the ground.

640
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,500
"Don't hit that dog again or I'll kill you,"
Thornton cried.

641
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,740
"It's my dog," said Hal.

642
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,660
"Go away or I'll hit you too.

643
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,830
I'm going to Dawson."

644
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,520
Thornton stood between him and Buck.

645
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,400
Hal took out his long knife.

646
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,770
Thornton knocked it out of Hal's hand.

647
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:20,010
Then Thornton picked it up and cut Buck's
harness.

648
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,960
Hal did not want to fight.

649
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,099
Buck was almost dead.

650
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,440
A few minutes later Hal and the sled went
along the river.

651
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,589
Buck raised his head and saw Pike, Solleks,
Joe and Teek pulling the sled.

652
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:35,630
Thornton examined Buck's body.

653
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,299
He was looking for broken bones.

654
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:40,760
Buck was terribly thin and weak.

655
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:47,500
"You have many wounds, but no broken bones,"
said Thornton.

656
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,890
Both dog and man watched the sled.

657
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,260
It was crossing the ice in the middle of the
river.

658
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,940
Suddenly the back of the sled went down and
the front went up.

659
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,040
There was a lot of screaming.

660
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Then a big piece of ice broke and the dogs
and the people disappeared.

661
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,900
John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.

662
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,800
"You poor dog," said Thornton and Buck licked
his hand.

663
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,760
John Thornton was ill all winter.

664
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,970
His friends left him at White River while
they went to Dawson.

665
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,609
Thornton had a lot of food and he was comfortable.

666
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:29,400
Now it was spring and he was better.

667
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,720
During the warm spring days he and Buck sat
by the river.

668
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Buck watched the water and listened to the
birds.

669
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,510
He needed the long rest.

670
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,200
Slowly he became stronger and fatter.

671
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,160
John Thornton had two other dogs.

672
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,869
Skeet was a small dog and she made friends
with Buck.

673
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,670
When Buck was ill she took care of him.

674
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,099
She washed his cuts with her tongue.

675
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,120
Nig was a big friendly dog.

676
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,780
His eyes laughed.

677
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,630
When Buck became stronger the three dogs played
together.

678
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,190
Thornton sometimes played with them.

679
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,520
The days passed happily.

680
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,330
For the first time Buck learned to love.

681
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,400
He and Judge Miller were very good friends,
but Buck did not love him.

682
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,790
John Thornton saved Buck's life and he was
the perfect master.

683
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,250
He loved his dogs and took good care of them.

684
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,540
The dogs were like his children.

685
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,570
He always talked to Buck.

686
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,800
He took Buck's head between his hands and
shook it lovingly.

687
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,730
He adored Thornton.

688
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,789
When Thornton touched him or spoke to him
he was wild with happiness.

689
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:48,660
He sat near Thornton and looked at his face
for hours.

690
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,809
At first Buck followed Thornton everywhere.

691
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:56,050
He did not want Thornton to leave like Francois
and Perrault.

692
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:01,000
Buck was very happy with Thornton but he was
a dog of the Northland.

693
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,490
He dreamed of other animals and heard them
calling him.

694
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,099
It was the call of the wild.

695
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,170
Sometimes Buck wanted to answer the call.

696
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,859
He often went into the forest but he always
returned to Thornton.

697
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:20,240
Buck was not interested in other men.

698
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,840
When Thornton's friends Hans and Pete returned,
Buck did not notice them.

699
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,309
He knew they were Thornton's good friends
and so he accepted them.

700
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:34,920
Hans and Pete saw that Buck loved only Thornton
and no one else.

701
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,349
He was always happy to obey Thornton.

702
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:41,319
One day they were in Circle City.

703
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:45,020
"Black" Burton was a bad and cruel man.

704
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,380
He was in a saloon and he was fighting with
another man.

705
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,420
Thornton tried to stop them.

706
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,400
Buck sat in a corner and watched.

707
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,140
Burton hit Thornton and he almost fell.

708
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,640
There was a loud growl and Buck jumped into
the air at Burton's throat.

709
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,490
The man put up his arm and saved his life.

710
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,480
Then he fell to the ground with Buck on top
of him.

711
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,859
Buck bit into his throat.

712
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:11,900
Some people pulled Buck off the man.

713
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,940
A doctor arrived and examined Burton's throat.

714
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,740
"The dog attacked only because Thornton was
in danger," someone said.

715
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:25,609
From that day Buck's name became famous all
over the Northland.

716
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:30,340
In the fall of that year Buck saved Thornton's
life another time.

717
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,520
The three men were going down the river.

718
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,140
Thornton was in the boat and Hans and Pete
were on the river bank.

719
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,290
They were holding the boat with a rope.

720
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,590
Buck was on the bank and watched his master.

721
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,220
Soon they came to a dangerous part of the
river.

722
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,280
The boat was going too fast because the current
was strong.

723
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,440
Hans pulled the rope to stop the boat, but
it turned over.

724
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,380
Thornton fell into the water.

725
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,630
Buck jumped in immediately and swam to his
master.

726
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:04,289
Thornton took Buck's tail and Buck swam bravely
towards the river bank.

727
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,390
But they moved slowly because the river pushed
them to the rocks.

728
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:12,990
"We can't get to the river bank because the
current is too strong," said Thornton.

729
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,520
He held onto a rock and let go of Buck's tail.

730
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,640
Then he cried, "Go, Buck!

731
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
Go!"

732
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,250
Buck obeyed and swam to the river bank.

733
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,309
Hans and Pete pulled him out of the river.

734
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:26,800
"We must work fast to save Thornton.

735
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,400
He's in great danger!" said Pete.

736
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,350
They tied a rope around Buck and he jumped
into the river again.

737
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,690
The river carried him past Thornton but he
finally reached him.

738
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,869
Thornton held on to Buck, and Hans and Pete
pulled the rope very hard.

739
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:45,380
Thornton and Buck disappeared under the water.

740
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,130
When Hans and Pete pulled them out they both
seemed dead.

741
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,450
But they slowly opened their eyes.

742
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,559
Thornton examined Buck's body and found three
broken bones.

743
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:04,310
"We must camp here until Buck is better,"
said Thornton.

744
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,960
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Winner

745
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,150
At Dawson that winter Buck did something that
made him very famous in the Northland.

746
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:18,329
Thornton, Hans and Pete wanted to go to the
east to look for gold.

747
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:20,200
But they needed money.

748
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,289
One day they were at the Eldorado Saloon.

749
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:28,650
"My dog can pull a sled with five hundred
pounds on it' said one man.

750
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,339
"Well, my dog can pull six hundred pounds'
said another man.

751
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,339
"Really?

752
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:39,089
Well, my dog can pull seven hundred pounds,"
said a third man called Matthewson.

753
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:41,829
"That's nothing," said Thornton.

754
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:44,140
"Buck can pull a thousand pounds."

755
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:49,430
"Can he move the sled when it's frozen to
the ice and then pull it a hundred yards?"

756
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,430
asked Matthewson.

757
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,700
"Yes, he can," said Thornton.

758
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,640
"Well," said Matthewson.

759
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,710
"I've got a thousand dollars here, and I say
he can't."

760
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,830
He took a bag of gold and put it on the table.

761
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,049
Nobody spoke.

762
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:11,340
Thornton thought, "I know Buck is strong,
but is he really so strong?"

763
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,250
The men at the saloon looked at him silently
and waited.

764
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,740
Thornton did not have a thousand dollars,
and his friends did not either.

765
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,190
"I've got a sled outside with a thousand pounds
on it," Matthewson said.

766
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,941
"Do you want to try?"

767
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:28,520
Thornton did not know what to say.

768
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,980
He looked at all the men.

769
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,470
Then he saw his old friend Jim O'Brien.

770
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,799
"Can you lend me a thousand dollars, Jim?"

771
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:39,049
Thornton said softly.

772
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:40,599
"Sure," said O'Brien.

773
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:44,290
"But I don't think your dog can do it."

774
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,390
Everyone went into the street.

775
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,830
A lot of men stood around Matthewson's sled.

776
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:55,079
The sled was frozen to the ice because it
was terribly cold. 

777
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,410
Matthewson was sure Buck could not win and
said, "I'm paying another four hundred dollars!

778
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,099
What about you?"

779
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,210
Thornton, Hans and Pete talked together.

780
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:12,109
They had only two hundred dollars and they
added them to the thousand dollars.

781
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:14,809
Buck felt the excitement in the air.

782
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:19,299
He knew he must do something great for Thornton.

783
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:21,170
Buck was in perfect condition.

784
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,300
He was a splendid dog.

785
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,390
Thornton sat down on the snow next to Buck.

786
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,440
He held Buck's head in his hands and spoke
softly in his ear. 

787
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,150
"If you love me, Buck.

788
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,320
If you love me."

789
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,280
Buck understood.

790
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,880
He took Thornton's hand between his teeth
and then let go.

791
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,339
He often did this as a sign of his love.

792
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:48,430
Everyone was silent.

793
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,079
Thornton stood up and said, "Ready, Buck."

794
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,900
Buck pulled on the harness.

795
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,890
"Right!" cried Thornton.

796
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,640
Buck pulled to the right and stopped suddenly.

797
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,859
"Now, left!"

798
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,430
cried Thornton.

799
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,049
Buck pulled to the left.

800
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:04,950
The ice was breaking.

801
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,309
"Now, MUSH!"

802
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:08,780
Buck started to pull.

803
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,549
His strong body pulled harder and harder.

804
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:14,180
The sled moved a little.

805
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,670
Suddenly it started to go forward on the snow.

806
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,849
Buck pulled it for one hundred yards.

807
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:22,410
He was the winner!

808
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,560
The men shouted and threw their hats in the
air.

809
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,809
Thornton was on the snow with Buck.

810
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:30,690
He took his head and shook it.

811
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,060
He was crying with happiness.

812
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,230
Buck had Thornton's hand between his teeth.

813
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:42,799
In five minutes Buck made one thousand six
hundred dollars for Thornton and his friends.

814
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:48,270
With this money they could travel to the east
to look for a lost gold mine.

815
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,309
No one knew where it was.

816
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,240
It was a mystery.

817
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,339
The three men with Buck and six other dogs
started to go east.

818
00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:01,960
They traveled up the Stewart River and into
the Mackenzie Mountains.

819
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,250
Thornton was not afraid of the wild.

820
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,710
He hunted his food during the day.

821
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,220
Buck was very happy.

822
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,210
He loved hunting, fishing and traveling.

823
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,970
They camped in different places and looked
for gold.

824
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:20,779
In the summer they built small boats and crossed
mountain lakes and went down rivers.

825
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:25,799
The months passed and they continued to travel
in the unknown country.

826
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:31,630
In the winter they found an old cabin, but
they did not find the gold mine.

827
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,750
Then in the spring they found a stream with
gold in it.

828
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,940
It looked like yellow butter.

829
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,029
Every day the men worked hard and found lots
of gold.

830
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:45,940
They put it in many big bags.

831
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,609
Each bag had fifty pounds of gold.

832
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:53,559
The dogs did nothing except watch the men
and eat.

833
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,680
Buck spent many hours sitting by the fire
and dreaming.

834
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,700
Sometimes during the day he heard a call from
the forest.

835
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,070
He listened and ran off into the forest.

836
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,289
He loved running under the tall trees and
looking at the birds.

837
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:11,740
One night he woke up suddenly.

838
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,400
He heard the call again.

839
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,910
It came from the forest and it was a long
howl.

840
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,520
He ran into the forest and followed the sound.

841
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,650
He came to an open space in the trees and
saw a wolf.

842
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,260
He was sitting and his nose was up in the
air.

843
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,140
He was looking at the sky.

844
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,609
Buck walked towards him slowly and silently.

845
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:40,529
The wolf stopped howling and ran away.

846
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:42,480
Buck followed him.

847
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,020
After some time the wolf stopped and growled
at Buck.

848
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,490
He was afraid because Buck was much bigger.

849
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,309
But Buck did not want to fight.

850
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:54,000
He wanted to make friends with the wolf.

851
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,770
The wolf understood and they touched noses.

852
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,270
They became friends and played together.

853
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:04,569
They ran for hours through the forest and
under the open sky.

854
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:07,290
Old memories came back to Buck.

855
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,089
He was very happy.

856
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:14,369
They stopped by a stream to drink and Buck
remembered John Thornton.

857
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:16,559
The wolf wanted Buck to follow him.

858
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,520
But Buck turned and slowly went back.

859
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,299
The wolf followed him for a while.

860
00:50:21,299 --> 00:50:24,170
Then he sat down and howled.

861
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:30,260
It was a sad howl.

862
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,780
Thornton was eating dinner when Buck returned.

863
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,869
He jumped all over Thornton and licked his
face.

864
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,640
For two days and nights Buck never left camp.

865
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,220
He followed Thornton everywhere.

866
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,470
But soon Buck heard the call again.

867
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:48,000
He thought about his wild brother and the
forest.

868
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,069
Buck began to sleep out at night.

869
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:53,549
He stayed away from camp for three or four
days.

870
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:55,880
Once he stayed away for a week.

871
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,360
He looked for his wild brother but could not
find him.

872
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:04,210
He fished in the streams and killed animals
for food.

873
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,660
Every part of his body was alive and healthy.

874
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,619
He was stronger and faster than other dogs.

875
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,560
There was so much energy in Buck.

876
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,650
One day Buck was going to the forest and Thornton
said, "What a fantastic dog!"

877
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:26,390
Hans and Pete agreed.

878
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,000
Chapter NINE
The Call of the Wild

879
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,210
In the fall many moose came to the valley
because it was warmer.

880
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,609
Buck wanted to hunt a big moose.

881
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:41,039
The biggest moose was six feet tall and had
enormous antlers.

882
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,410
He was much bigger and stronger than Buck.

883
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,170
When he saw Buck he growled angrily.

884
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,010
Buck followed the moose for many hours.

885
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:55,450
He was clever and thought, " must separate
him from his group."

886
00:51:55,450 --> 00:52:00,790
It was not easy, but by evening the moose
was away from his group.

887
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,369
Buck started to attack him.

888
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:04,549
Wild animals are patient.

889
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:06,670
They do not hurry.

890
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:11,780
They wait for the right moment and then they
attack.

891
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,809
Buck knew how to wait.

892
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:18,109
For four days Buck attacked and jumped away.

893
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:20,630
Then he danced in front of the big moose.

894
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,010
He never left him alone.

895
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,140
The moose could not eat, drink, sleep or rest.

896
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:34,210
He became very tired and very weak and stopped
for long periods so Buck ate, drank and rested.

897
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:39,290
At the end of the fourth day Buck killed the
big moose.

898
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:46,990
For a day and a night he stayed by the dead
moose and ate and slept.

899
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:52,700
When he was rested and strong, he decided
to return to John Thornton.

900
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:59,089
When Buck was five miles from camp he smelled
something strange, something terrible.

901
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:01,099
He started running fast.

902
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:06,150
The forest was silent, there were no birds
and no small animals.

903
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,170
Near some trees he found the dead body of
Nig.

904
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,550
He had an arrow in his body.

905
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,510
He found another sled dog with an arrow in
his neck.

906
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:20,410
Near the camp Buck heard voices singing.

907
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,850
Then he found Hans' body with arrows in his
back.

908
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,890
A wild, terrible anger grew in Buck.

909
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,590
He could not control his anger.

910
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:37,750
He saw the Yeehat Indians dancing at Thornton's
camp and he suddenly attacked them.

911
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,660
He wanted to destroy them.

912
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,839
Buck was faster than the wind.

913
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,500
He jumped at the Indians with all his strength
and anger.

914
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,770
He cut the throat of two Indians with his
sharp teeth.

915
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:52,470
Nothing could stop him and he killed many
Yeehats.

916
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,270
He was like a devil.

917
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:58,900
The Indians escaped into the forest but Buck
followed them.

918
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,109
When Buck returned to the camp he found Pete's
body.

919
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:06,299
He followed Thornton's smell to a pool.

920
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:09,789
Buck knew Thornton's body was in the pool.

921
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,660
He stayed by the pool all day.

922
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,819
He knew John Thornton was dead.

923
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,930
Now he was very sad and alone.

924
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:25,410
When he looked at the dead Yeehats he was
proud of himself.

925
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,160
That night there was a full moon.

926
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,370
Buck heard the sounds of the forest.

927
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,369
They became louder.

928
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:38,460
It was the call of the wild and he was ready
to obey.

929
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,029
John Thornton was dead.

930
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,799
He was completely free.

931
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:46,619
A wolf pack entered Buck's valley.

932
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:49,339
He watched them silently.

933
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:53,250
They were afraid because Buck was so big.

934
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:57,809
Then one wolf jumped at Buck and he attacked
and broke the wolf's neck.

935
00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:01,589
Three other wolves jumped at him but he attacked
them.

936
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,400
Finally all the wolf pack attacked Buck.

937
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,220
He jumped "at them with his great strength
and intelligence.

938
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,690
They could not stop him.

939
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,940
After half an hour the pack went away.

940
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,280
They were very tired.

941
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,079
One wolf was friendly and went close to Buck.

942
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,710
Buck remembered him, it was his wild brother.

943
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,960
They touched noses.

944
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,820
Other wolves came to make friends.

945
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:31,880
An old wolf sat down, looked at the moon and
howled.

946
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,329
The others sat down and howled too.

947
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:38,900
Buck did the same.

948
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,019
Soon the wolves were all around Buck and smelled
him.

949
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,730
Then they ran into the forest and Buck ran
with them.

950
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:50,220
His wild brother ran by his side.

951
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,420
Perhaps this is the end of Buck's story.

952
00:55:53,420 --> 00:56:00,710
But after a few years the Yeehat Indians saw
that some wolves had brown in their gray coats.

953
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:06,850
They also saw a "Ghost Dog" at the front of
the wolf pack.

954
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:12,300
When the Yeehats follow the moose they do
not enter a certain valley.

955
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:19,740
In the summer there is a visitor in that valley:
a big, golden-brown wolf.

956
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,710
He is bigger than any other wolf.

957
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:27,700
He goes to a yellow stream, stops there and
then howls.

958
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,410
But he is not always alone.

959
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,420
He is the leader of the wolf pack.

960
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,589
He runs in the moonlight and sings the song
of the pack.

961
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:39,869
- THE END -
