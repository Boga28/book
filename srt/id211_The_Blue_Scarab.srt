00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,360
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,280
Cairo

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,400
Monica noticed the gift shop, because of the 
beautiful colours round its door and window.  

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,320
She walked through its entrance which had a sign 
above it. On the sign, the word Cairo was written  

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,240
in bright yellow, orange and green colours, 
with small black figures dancing beside it.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,600
Inside, it was just as colourful. Large animals 
made of paper, painted in very bright colours,  

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:50,080
hung from the ceiling. The floor had a 
yellow-brown sand colour to it, and the shelves  

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:57,840
held vases, plates, boxes, musical instruments 
and jewellery Monica had never seen before.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,560
No one seemed to be in the shop; not a salesperson  

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,160
or a customer. Light Arab music came 
from a stereo Monica could not see,  

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,520
but she moved with its sound as she looked 
at all the wonderful objects in the shop.  

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
She saw a blue stone on a gold 
necklace which looked interesting.  

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
Drawn in the centre of the stone there was 
something which looked like a large round beetle,  

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
with thin legs and thick 
antennae coming from its head.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,480
"It's an Egyptian scarab."

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,800
The woman's voice surprised, then frightened 
Monica. She almost dropped the necklace.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
"I'm sorry I didn't know anyone was here."

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,840
"It's okay, my dear. I knew 
you would be here. Come. Come."

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,320
The woman took Monica's arm and led her 
behind the sales counter to a small area  

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,480
where there was a round table and two chairs.  

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,840
It was dark because cloth the colour of sand, with 
dark patterns, hung from the walls and ceilings.  

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,880
It was almost closed off from the rest of 
the shop by a curtain, so most of the light  

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,000
came from a few candles set around the room. It 
was like a small cave from somewhere far away.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,880
"Sit. I've made us some tea, 
black tea; the tea of judgement."

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
"Judgement?"

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,280
"Yes. The tea leaves tell us 
about a person's entire life.  

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
Some of us have done things we wish we 
hadn't. Some of us haven't done things  

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,920
we wish we had. Some of us are messengers. 
Some of us are waiting for the message."

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,600
The woman wore a piece of red 
cloth tied around her head.  

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,760
It hid the colour of her hair. Her eyes 
were large and dark. They became larger  

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,360
when she talked. As Monica sat at the table, she 
realised she still had the necklace in her hand.

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,520
"This stone is quite beautiful. 
I've never seen anything like it."

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,800
"It is lapis lazuli, the ancient blue 
stone used to make statues for the gods.  

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,200
It was found in rock, and the rock had to be 
burned and broken to get the lapis lazuli out.  

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
That shows you how strong it is."

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
"Well, I'm sure it's too expensive for me..."

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
As Monica was about to put 
the necklace on the table,  

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
the woman closed her hand around 
Monica's, to keep the stone there.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,800
"Don't let it go, now that you have 
it. It may help you see things you  

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
never thought were possible."

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,280
"But... I..."

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,880
The woman put her finger on Monica's 
lips so that she couldn't talk.

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,360
"Sit and listen and I will tell 
you the story of the blue scarab."

44
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,640
Monica held the necklace in her hand while 
the woman spoke. Whether it was the heat of  

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,840
the room, the tea, or the woman's soft 
voice, Monica began to fall asleep.

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,720
"The scarab is the sacred beetle of the sun 
god, the most important of all the gods as it  

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,680
makes people see things in a different way. It is 
given to a different person every hundred years.  

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,520
The person is chosen by the sun god to act as a 
messenger for the dead. They see and understand  

49
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,360
things on earth that help the gods decide 
whether the dead have lived good or bad lives.  

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,520
Those who wear it are sometimes frightened 
because they are able to see the dead  

51
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,200
living again. But they must keep the scarab, 
as the judgement of so many depends on them."

52
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,960
Monica heard the woman's words as she slept. 
She saw herself living thousands of years ago,  

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,120
wearing the scarab. People were touching her 
hand as she passed them. She was smiling and  

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,840
she felt very peaceful. When she opened her 
eyes, she looked at the woman talking to her.

55
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,160
"It looks good on you."

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:37,840
Monica touched the necklace with her 
fingers. It was now round her neck.
 
 
 

57
00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:04,800
CHAPTER TWO

58
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:45,840
Herbie

59
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,800
Monica's car had a broken headlight. As she drove 
to a garage to have it fixed, the sun came down  

60
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,280
through the trees along the road, making 
everything seem more alive than usual.

61
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,040
There was an old man cleaning 
the ground in front of the garage  

62
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,240
when Monica parked her car. He had 
his back to her, so she called to him:

63
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
"Excuse me. Do you work here?"

64
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
The man did not turn round.

65
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
"Excuse me."

66
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,520
Monica put her hand on the man's shoulder.  

67
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,360
He turned quickly and Monica saw 
her father's face. Frightened,  

68
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,200
she put her hands over her mouth. Her father had 
died five years earlier when she was eighteen.

69
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,080
"Dad! Is that you?" 

70
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
Tears came to her eyes and her hands shook.  

71
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,840
The man moved his fingers to his mouth and 
ears to show her he could not speak or hear.

72
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,440
"Hello there!"

73
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,760
It was the voice of a young man Monica knew 
from the university. She had forgotten his name.

74
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
"It's Owen, remember? We 
met at a party last winter."

75
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,160
"Oh, er yes! I'm Monica."

76
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,480
"I suppose you' ve met Herbie. He just 
started working here this morning."

77
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,520
Monica wouldn't look at the man, 
afraid of what she would see.  

78
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,640
He was talking to Owen in sign language. Owen 
spoke as he made the signs with his fingers.

79
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,080
"Of course you can. I told you, Mr Burns 
lets us take our lunch whenever we want.  

80
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,120
As long as you've finished your 
work. Okay, you're welcome."

81
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,840
Herbie walked away. Suddenly, 
Owen noticed Monica's necklace.

82
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,440
"Is that a blue scarab you're wearing?"

83
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,560
"Yes, a woman at a shop gave it to me. 
She wouldn't take any money for it."

84
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,520
"It was found in a chest believed to be the 
chest of Osiris, an ancient Egyptian god.  

85
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
I read about it in my class on 
ancient Egypt. I study archaeology."

86
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
"I think I saw you leaving 
that class once. I had an  

87
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
economics class right after it in the same room."

88
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,640
"It's a small world. So, 
what's wrong with your car?"

89
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,680
"It needs a new headlight."

90
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
"Oh, that's no problem. I 
can fix that in ten minutes.  

91
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Why don't you go sit in the office? While 
you wait, Mr Burns will write out your bill."

92
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,120
In the office next to the garage, Mr Burns sat 
behind his desk smoking a cigar. He was a short,  

93
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,920
bald man, but Monica didn't know how 
short until he stood up to shake her hand.

94
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,720
"Nathan Burns. Pleased to meet you."

95
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,320
"Monica Halloway. Owen's fixing my headlight. 
Er, he said you'd write up the papers."

96
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
"Certainly I will. You just have a seat 
there. I'll take care of it in two minutes."

97
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,920
Monica looked out of the office 
window at Owen working on her car.  

98
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
His thin, young face began to look old and tired.

99
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,880
It was as if she was looking 
at a completely different man  

100
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,480
and it frightened her. Mr Burn's 
voice stopped her thinking.

101
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
"How do you spell, Halloway, with two Ls or one?"

102
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,880
"What? Oh, two. H, A, double L, O, W, A, Y."

103
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,960
Monica went outside to see Owen as he finished his 
work on her car. He looked like he usually did,  

104
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,720
and Monica forgot about what she thought 
she had seen before. She shook his hand.

105
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
"Thank you very much for your help."

106
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,120
"Anytime. It was nice to see you again."

107
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,720
When Owen walked away, Monica saw Herbie 
sitting on a chair by the garage door.  

108
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,680
He was eating a sandwich. She 
saw something on his right arm.  

109
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,400
It was a purple birthmark, 
the same kind her father had.

110
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,320
"It is you. I knew it!"

111
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,360
She took a few steps towards 
Herbie, but she frightened him.  

112
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:25,840
He got up and went into the garage. When she 
followed him inside, she saw that he had gone.
 
 
 

113
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,160
CHAPTER THREE

114
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,840
Tops

115
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,760
"Look. If you don't stop this, you'll get 
yourself into trouble. It was a mistake.  

116
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,520
You saw something which wasn't there,"

117
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Yvonne was able to make Monica relax.  

118
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
They ordered their pizza and began 
to talk about other things when

119
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
Monica saw Owen across the room.

120
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,840
"Now don't tell me I don't see him. 
That's the guy who fixed my car."

121
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,120
Owen saw them looking over at him, and he 
waved hello. He walked over and sat with them.

122
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,680
"I'm glad I found you."

123
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,520
"Owen, this is Yvonne."

124
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,040
"Pleased to meet you. Look, I've 
read more about your blue scarab."

125
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,880
"Wait a minute... wait a minute! I've 
just finished telling her that there  

126
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
is no such thing as ghosts or sun gods 
or whatever else you want to tell her."

127
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
"Yvonne, let him finish."

128
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,320
"The ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris, the 
sun god's helper, used that stone so that people  

129
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,880
on earth could help those who had died. They 
thought dead people had to go through a trial.  

130
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,200
In that trial, they had to show that 
the good things they had done on earth  

131
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,600
were greater than the bad things. Their actions 
could help the living improve themselves by  

132
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,320
teaching them something. If the living learn 
something valuable from the life of someone else,  

133
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,680
who is now dead, they can continue 
living their lives in a better way.  

134
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,040
This is good for the living but also for 
the dead. The gods will see that the dead  

135
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,120
had lived good lives since they continue 
influencing the living in a positive way."

136
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
"Owen, that was thousands of years ago!"

137
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
"Wait a minute, Yvonne.  

138
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,320
Let's just try to understand this. Do you think 
I could have seen a dead person alive again?"

139
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,080
"I don't know about that, but I know 
someone who does, and he'd like to meet you.  

140
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,040
His name is Professor Lloyd. He taught that 
class on ancient Egypt I told you about.  

141
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,080
Would you like to talk to him?"

142
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,200
"Why not?"

143
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,640
"This is mad!"

144
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,640
Monica was silent for a few minutes, 
because she was thinking of her father.  

145
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,920
She finally asked Owen about Herbie.

146
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,160
"Who's that old man who is working at 
the garage? What's his name, Herbie?"

147
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:51,840
"Yeah, Herbie. Strange, but right after you left, 
we couldn't find him. He never came back."
 
 
 

148
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,920
CHAPTER FOUR

149
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,960
Professor Lloyd

150
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,760
When Owen and Monica knocked on Professor 
Lloyd's door, they heard a cat miaowing inside.  

151
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,920
They heard Professor Lloyd's 
footsteps coming toward the door,  

152
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,600
then they saw him: a tall 
well-built man with glasses.  

153
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,840
He had straight, grey-white hair and a soft, 
kind face. He welcomed them with a large smile.

154
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,280
"You must be Monica."

155
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
"Hello Professor Lloyd. It's 
a pleasure to meet you."

156
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,320
"The pleasure is mine.  

157
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,760
From what Owen tells me, you have something 
which may be more powerful than we know."

158
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,240
Professor Lloyd's flat was filled with books and 
cats. Each wall was covered with shelves of books,  

159
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,880
and there were cats of every different colour 
sitting on tables, walking across the floor,  

160
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,640
or rubbing themselves against Monica's legs. 
Monica picked up a black one with white paws.

161
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
"I love your cats, Professor."

162
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,560
"The Kauri Indians of southern Peru 
believe the cat spirit controls our lives.  

163
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
They probably know my cats and my life."

164
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,960
Professor Lloyd laughed loudly. He picked 
up two of the cats as they walked to the  

165
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,920
middle of the room where a bright light hung 
over a square white table with four chairs.

166
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,880
They sat at the table, and the professor 
asked to see the blue scarab. He put a round,  

167
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,320
one-inch eyepiece with black glass over his 
left eye, and he studied the back of the stone.

168
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,040
"Ah, yes. Here are the markings."

169
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,160
The professor was quiet. He took 
the eyepiece away from his eye  

170
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,320
and looked at Monica. Owen was worried.

171
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,720
"What is it Professor?"

172
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,800
"It seems that Monica has been 
chosen as a messenger for the gods."

173
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,440
"Gods! Professor, you don't really 
believe in the gods, do you?"

174
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,440
"What I mean is that this stone is 
exactly like the one in ancient mythology.  

175
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
The myth says that certain 
people are chosen to wear it."

176
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,880
"That's what the woman said who gave it to me."

177
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
"Professor, what are the markings?"

178
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
The Professor held the stone up to the light.

179
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,680
"You can't see it clearly without the eyepiece, 
but this marking here is the teeth of a dog.  

180
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,120
The dog watches over the dead. And here is the 
wing of a hawk. The hawk cries for the revenge  

181
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,200
of the dead. But here is the sign connecting 
all the others - the round horn of the ram.  

182
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,400
This represents the power of water. It can 
give life to the dead. The scarab on the front,  

183
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,680
which represents the sun, acts together with water 
to bring peace to both the living and the dead."

184
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
"How do you know all this?"

185
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,120
"It is written in ancient Egyptian tombs, but 
there is another way to see if we are right."

186
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,160
"What's that?"

187
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:21,840
"We can test the stone to see 
what kind of power it has."
 
 
 

188
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,960
CHAPTER FIVE

189
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,840
Professor Lloyd's Back Room

190
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,640
Professor Lloyd took Owen and 
Monica to the back room of his flat,  

191
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,120
where all the walls were 
covered with black curtains.  

192
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,680
In the centre of the room, there was a round, 
wooden table with strange black markings on it.  

193
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,800
In the centre, there was a circle with 
the drawing of an eye in the middle of it.  

194
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,720
Four spears, like rays of sunlight, went from 
the central circle to the edge of the table,  

195
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,960
dividing the table into four 
equal parts. There was another  

196
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,120
thin circle of numbers and letters 
that went round the edge of the table.  

197
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,520
Between the central circle and the circle at the 
edge of the table there were four equal spaces. In  

198
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:45,840
each there was a picture: one of a fish, one of a 
snake, one of the moon, and one of a lotus flower.

199
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,120
Professor Lloyd lit candles in the room as Owen 
and Monica sat at the table. The professor put  

200
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,000
on a tall black hat with a flat top, and a 
long black robe. He was the first to speak.

201
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,080
"We are going to try to call 
people back from the dead.  

202
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,520
If the stone has the power the myth says 
it does, we may hear voices we know."

203
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,640
The professor put the scarab over the eye in the 
centre of the table, with the beetle facing up.

204
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,280
"Now, we must all hold hands and close our eyes.  

205
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960
Do not break the circle by letting go of the 
hand of the person who is sitting next to you,  

206
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,440
or the ceremony will end. Relax, 
breathe slowly, and do not speak."

207
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,000
They were all very quiet. They 
heard a soft whistling sound.

208
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,640
It became louder, like the sound of the wind. 
The room became cold and all the candles were  

209
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:59,440
blown out. Then there were voices. Wild laughing, 
screams of pain. Then again the sound of the wind.

210
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,680
One voice spoke clearly,

211
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,560
"Jack, it's giving way! The tunnel is giving way!"

212
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,560
"Uncle Bob is that you?"

213
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,600
"Do not speak. They cannot hear you."

214
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,200
"Jack, the tunnel is falling! Jack!"

215
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:26,480
The sound of an earthquake was heard 
and then nothing. A new voice spoke.

216
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,120
"She means alright, but it's her first 
holiday on her own. Let her enjoy herself."

217
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,040
"Mother. It's me. I'm here!"

218
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,840
"Don't speak!"

219
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
More wind, then rain and thunder.

220
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,520
"The boat's going over! I can't hold it!"

221
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,680
The woman's voice screamed, then Monica screamed,

222
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,840
"Mother, no! I'm here!"

223
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,280
The lights went on and Monica was 
standing next to the round table  

224
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,840
where the professor and Owen were 
sitting. She ran out of the room.  

225
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,160
The professor found her in the front room 
where she was sitting on the sofa, crying. He  

226
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,240
sat next to her and put his arm round her as Owen 
walked nervously back and forth in front of them.

227
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,120
"It was my mother and father 
on the boat trip where they..."

228
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,160
"There, there. It's over now."

229
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,840
"What was that part about my 
uncle calling my father's name?"

230
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,040
"If you recognise a voice that you hear, it 
means that there is something wrong between  

231
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:47,840
you and that person. One thing is 
certain, the scarab is real."
 
 
 

232
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,000
CHAPTER SIX

233
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
Monica's Father Speaks

234
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,360
Yvonne drove Monica back to the Cairo gift shop 
so she could return the blue scarab to the gypsy  

235
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,680
woman. She did not want the necklace after 
that night at Professor Lloyd's. Her parents  

236
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:29,920
had both died on a boating holiday and hearing 
their voices again had really frightened her.

237
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,440
They parked the car near what they 
thought was the shop's window.  

238
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:48,640
The window was old and dirty. There 
was no sign with Cairo written on it.  

239
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,800
The door had wooden boards in front of it.

240
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
"I think it was here."

241
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,560
Yvonne looked around the street to see 
if they had made a mistake. Monica wiped  

242
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,080
the dust off one of the store windows 
with a tissue so she could see inside.  

243
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,360
The inside had pieces of wood hanging from the 
ceiling. There were old boards, stones and dirt  

244
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,360
all over the floor. It looked as if it hadn't 
been used for a long time. Then, Monica saw it.  

245
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,440
Hanging from the ceiling, there was one 
of the brightly coloured paper animals.  

246
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,760
It was a bright blue scarab. 
Monica ran to the car.

247
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
"Let's get out of here."

248
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
"What's wrong? What's happened?"

249
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,080
Yvonne got in the car, but Monica 
couldn't tell her what happened.

250
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,320
"Just drive me to the university. 
I'm not keeping this scarab."

251
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,400
"What are you going to do with it?"

252
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,840
"Give it to Professor Lloyd."

253
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,440
Yvonne left Monica at the university, 
where Professor Lloyd had an office on  

254
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
the top floor of the library. 
Monica knocked on the door.

255
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,640
"Yes?"

256
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
Monica opened the door.

257
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,480
"Professor Lloyd?"

258
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,800
"Monica, my dear! Come in. Come in."

259
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,200
Monica remembered the woman in 
the shop saying something similar.  

260
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,840
She took the necklace out of her bag and put it on 
the professor's desk. The sun was shining through  

261
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:34,640
the window. It hit the scarab. When Professor 
Lloyd spoke, he had Monica's father's voice.

262
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,200
"Monica, don't be afraid."

263
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
Monica covered her mouth with her hands.

264
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,720
"It's okay, dear. I need to talk to you. 
I know I was angry at you for not going  

265
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,360
with us on that boating trip, but you 
mustn't feel bad about it. You lived.  

266
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:58,720
Now we need your help. Keep the necklace. Live 
the best life possible. That will help us now."

267
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,400
The professor stopped talking, 
then he walked to the window.  

268
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:11,360
Monica sat looking at the scarab. She wasn't 
frightened. In fact, she felt very happy and calm.

269
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,160
"What does it mean, Professor?"

270
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
He did not turn to look at her. He 
spoke with his own voice this time.

271
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,760
"If you live a good life, you forgive 
others and try to help those you can.  

272
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,520
This has a great effect, because it shows that you 
have learned something from other people's lives.  

273
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,280
By doing this you will be able to teach 
others who will live after you have died."

274
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,960
She put the scarab around her 
neck. The professor continued.

275
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,400
"The fact that you were chosen to wear the scarab  

276
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,240
means you can do more than 
others. You can help many."

277
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,240
"Really, Professor? But how can this be done?"

278
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,840
"We all have people we have loved and who are now 
dead. We want their lives to be judged fairly."

279
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,840
The professor never turned away from the window. 
Before Monica left, he said two more words to her.

280
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,840
"Thank you."
 
 
 

281
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,000
CHAPTER SEVEN

282
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
Osiris and Seth

283
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,640
Owen was reading a book about Egyptian gods.  

284
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:52,000
It said that Osiris, the one who judges those 
who die, was once a king. His brother Seth  

285
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,600
wanted to be king, so he played a trick on 
Osiris. He brought him a beautiful, large chest,  

286
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,040
and he told the king that he could have the chest 
if he could fit inside it. After the king lay down  

287
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,760
in the chest, Seth quickly closed it, threw it 
into the Nile river, and it sailed out to sea.

288
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,480
Owen put the book down, because he began thinking 
of his own father's death. His father had been  

289
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,120
killed at an archaeological site. He was a famous 
archaeologist, which is why Owen wanted to be one.  

290
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,000
Owen's uncle was with Owen's father when he 
died. He came to live with Owen and his mother  

291
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,880
afterwards, and Owen had always thought his 
uncle didn't care about his father's death.  

292
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,920
He never talked about him and he 
behaved as if he were Owen's father.  

293
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,680
The voice he heard at the professor's 
suddenly meant something to him.  

294
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,320
He felt he had to talk to Monica. 
He remembered where she lived,  

295
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,840
because he had driven her home from the 
professor's. He hoped she wasn't asleep.

296
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,960
Monica was asleep when she heard the loud 
knocking at her door. It frightened her.

297
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,240
"Who is it?"

298
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,160
"It's me, Owen. Could you open 
the door? I have to talk to you!"

299
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,640
Owen looked awful. He held 
his books tightly in his arms  

300
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,080
and his hair stood up on his head 
as if he had been pulling at it.

301
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,480
"Can I come in? I've got something 
really important to talk to you about."

302
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,200
"Yes, come in, but calm down."

303
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,120
Monica made them some hot chocolate 
while Owen told her what he had read.

304
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,160
"I still don't understand what that 
story has to do with your uncle."

305
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,240
"That was my uncle's voice we heard at 
Professor Lloyd's. I know it's wrong,  

306
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,880
but I always thought my uncle had something to do 
with my father's death. He never talked about it."

307
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,280
"But that has nothing to do with the scarab."

308
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,920
"It does. Don't you remember Professor Lloyd 
telling us about the markings on the back?"

309
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,640
"Yes."

310
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
"Well, one of those marks was the ram's horn.  

311
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,920
It's the sign of water, which connects 
all the other signs. Osiris was killed  

312
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,960
by water. He looks after the dead, that's why 
there arc the markings of the dog's teeth."

313
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,400
"And the hawk's wing?"

314
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,520
"Osiris' son, Horus, killed his uncle 
for his lather. When Horus died,  

315
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,840
he became the hawk god who sits by his father 
when he judges the dead and cries for them."

316
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,360
Monica touched the scarab around her 
neck. She knew that she and Owen had  

317
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,480
been brought together for some reason. 
Maybe she could do something for him.  

318
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,400
Owen was holding his cup of hot chocolate, 
thinking very hard. Finally, he spoke.

319
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,200
"I think I should go and talk to my uncle."

320
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,600
"He would probably like that."

321
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,040
"I haven't spoken to him in five years."

322
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,240
"Would you like me to go with you?"

323
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:11,840
He looked at Monica. "Yes."
 
 
 

324
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,480
CHAPTER EIGHT

325
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,840
The Gloves

326
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,120
Owen's uncle was painting the front of his house 
when Monica and Owen drove up the dirt road.  

327
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,760
He pushed back his cap to get a better look, and 
seemed very surprised when he saw who it was.  

328
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
Owen held out his hand.

329
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,080
"Hello, uncle Bob."

330
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,160
They shook hands, then hugged.

331
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
"You're the last person in the world I 
expected to see coming up that road today."

332
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,840
"Well, I thought, it was time 
I paid a visit to say hello."

333
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,520
Uncle Bob's blue eyes were bright with 
happiness as he looked into his nephew's eyes.  

334
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,840
He looked over at Monica.

335
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
"I'm sorry. This is my friend, Monica."

336
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
"How do you do?"

337
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,680
"Nice to meet you, sir."

338
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,600
They all went and sat on the back porch which 
looked onto a huge empty field surrounded by  

339
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:23,600
trees. Uncle Bob brought them some lemonade. A 
large friendly dog lay next to Monica's chair  

340
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,000
and she lightly scratched its head.

341
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,920
"Do you two mind if I take a 
walk with my new friend here?"

342
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,800
The men didn't answer, so Monica ran 
down the porch steps into the field  

343
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,080
with the dog following her.

344
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,400
"Uncle Bob, what happened the day my father died?"

345
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,080
His uncle stopped talking and looked at 
the long empty field in front of him.  

346
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,520
Monica had disappeared somewhere with the dog.

347
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,640
"We never really talked about 
that, did we? But maybe it's time."

348
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,640
"I never understood why you never 
mentioned his name alter he died."

349
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,840
His uncle looked over at him.

350
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,840
"Owen, some things hurt too much to talk about."

351
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
"Do you think you could talk about it now?"

352
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,040
"I could try. You see, there was this 
big earthquake two days before we went  

353
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,080
down in the tunnel. I told your father 
there would be another one, but he..."

354
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,960
His uncle was having trouble telling this part.

355
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,760
"...but he wouldn't listen. It was 
our last day, and he wanted to go.  

356
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,960
When it hit, I was up above cleaning 
some of the pieces we'd found."

357
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,480
Owen could see it happening. He didn't even 
notice that his uncle had got up to go inside.  

358
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,000
He heard the back door open, and then 
he saw his uncle standing next to him,  

359
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
holding an old pair of gloves.

360
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:57,760
"Your father gave these to me the day he 
died because I had left mine at home. He  

361
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,880
wore them every time he went out to dig. I 
think he'd have wanted you to have them."

362
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
Owen held the gloves in his hands.  

363
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:15,760
He put them on. There were tears in his 
eyes. His uncle put his arm around him.

364
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,840
Soon after Monica returned from her 
walk, she and Owen got ready to leave.  

365
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,840
They promised uncle Bob they 
would come back again soon.  

366
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:41,840
As they drove away, Monica beeped the horn twice.

367
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:51,600
In the car, Owen was quiet. Monica saw the gloves 
in his hand, but she didn't ask him about them.  

368
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:09,840
That was between Owen, his 
uncle and his father.
 
 
 

369
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,640
CHAPTER NINE

370
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,480
Cemetery

371
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,120
After leaving Owen's uncle, Monica 
did something Owen didn't expect.  

372
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,840
She drove the car into a cemetery.

373
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,560
"Where are we going?"

374
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,760
"My parents were buried here. I 
want to see their gravestones."

375
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,080
They parked the car in the 
visitors' car park, then walked.  

376
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,120
The sun was very bright. They were walking 
through a field of white crosses and gravestones.  

377
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,480
They stopped to look at some of the older ones.

378
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,840
"Look at this one, 1826."

379
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,360
"And this one is from 1905. Michael 
Mason. Look, his wife died a year later."

380
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,400
"I think I like archaeology because of the 
connection between two periods of time.  

381
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,120
I mean, when I understand the way 
someone lived hundreds of years ago,  

382
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,880
I understand more about the way we live now."

383
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,640
Monica took Owen's hand and walked 
with him to her parents' graves.

384
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,160
"They were never buried here. We just 
have the graves to remember them.  

385
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,960
They died at sea. Their bodies were never found."

386
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,800
Monica took a jar of water from her coat pocket.  

387
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,960
She poured some of it over each 
of her parents' gravestones.

388
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,800
"What's that?"

389
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,160
"It's water I took from the sea. I was at 
my parents' funeral, but I never felt like  

390
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I said goodbye. This is something I thought of 
doing to let them know that everything is okay."

391
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,880
"Was there a problem between 
you and your parents?" "Well,  

392
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,280
my father loved our family holidays. The summer 
they died was the first time I hadn't gone with  

393
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,280
them. Some friends of mine had a beach house. 
I was eighteen. I wanted to be with my friends.  

394
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,440
My dad and I had a big fight. We didn't talk to 
each other before he left on their boat trip.  

395
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,800
I felt guilty about that. In fact, I never forgave 
myself, until I began to believe in this scarab."

396
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,520
She touched the stone on her neck. "You 
think your father will somehow feel that  

397
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,320
your argument meant nothing compared 
to how much you loved each other?"

398
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,680
"Something like that. All the things I've seen and 
heard since I got the scarab have given me hope.  

399
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,760
I would like to believe that I live a better life 
now because of the good things done by the people  

400
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:05,600
who lived before me. It does justify their life. 
If what the ancient Egyptians said was true,  

401
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,560
I mean the fact that people's 
lives are judged after they die,  

402
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,120
then I believe it's our duty to 
show the gods that those who died  

403
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,840
did help us by their good actions. It's 
a good reason to do the best you can."

404
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,880
As Owen and Monica walked back to the 
car in the bright golden sunlight,  

405
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:39,840
they looked like two dark figures 
slowly disappearing into the distance.

406
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:39,875
CHAPTER TEN

407
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:39,923
The Blue Scarab

408
00:43:39,924 --> 00:43:40,198
Monica was sitting in the living room of 
Owen's Hat, waiting for him. He had gone to  

409
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:40,524
use a neighbour's telephone because his was out of 
order. She found a book on the table next to her.  

410
00:43:40,524 --> 00:43:40,831
It was a library book on ancient Egypt. She opened 
it to the story of Osiris and began to read:

411
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:41,128
After Seth had thrown the chest, with Osiris 
inside, into the Nile, Osiris' wife, his, went  

412
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:41,437
to look for it. She found the chest, but before 
she could open it and bury the body, Seth stole  

413
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:41,740
it from her. He cut the body into sixteen separate 
pieces and hid them all over Egypt. Again,  

414
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:42,044
Isis went to look for them. This time, she took 
her sister, Nephthys, with her. Together they  

415
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:42,344
found each piece. Isis had magical powers. She 
put the body back together with a special oil.

416
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:42,622
"This oil is from the tree of healing. It 
will keep the body after it is buried. This  

417
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:42,906
white cloth that I will put around him will 
let the gods know that he was a great king."

418
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:43,099
The gods liked what Isis had 
done, and they rewarded Osiris.

419
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:43,338
"Osiris will decide on the life of 
the dead. If someone is good and just,  

420
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:43,638
they will be rewarded. Those who are evil and 
do not respect others' lives will be punished."

421
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:43,954
So, Osiris was made the judge of the dead. When 
somebody died, their soul, which left their body,  

422
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,235
was put through forty-two tests. After these 
tests, the soul was brought before Osiris.

423
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:44,448
Osiris sat in front of a pair of 
scales. He held a feather in his  

424
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:44,664
hand. Next to him there was a man 
with a dog's head and a man with  

425
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:44,883
the head of a falcon. Osiris held 
the feather out to the dog's head.

426
00:43:44,884 --> 00:43:45,126
"Anubis, take this feather and place 
it on one end of the scale. It is the  

427
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:45,374
feather of truth. It will tell us who 
has lived a just life and who has not."

428
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:45,493
Osiris then spoke to the falcon head.

429
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:46,240
"Horus, you are my son. You tried to find 
revenge for my death by killing your uncle.  

430
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,061
Take the soul and put it on the opposite end of 
the scale. There you will cry for its revenge."

431
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:47,588
The falcon head walked to the 
scale opposite the dog's head.  

432
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:48,098
They held each scale until 
Osiris told them to let them go.

433
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:48,686
"This soul has passed through the 
forty-two tests. These tests were  

434
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:49,447
given to decide if your good deeds in life 
are greater than your bad ones. You have not  

435
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:50,077
passed these tests alone. People who 
are living have acted for you. Now,  

436
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:50,751
it is time to see. Have you lived a good 
and just life? Let go of the scales."

437
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:51,262
The falcon and dog let go of 
the scales. The falcon made a  

438
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:51,798
loud cry. The scales balanced. 
Osiris held up the blue scarab.

439
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,455
"This is what we will use to speak to 
the living. Through this the souls of  

440
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:53,129
the dead will be judged. We hope that 
the living will understand what we say."

441
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:53,302
"Now, I understand."

442
00:43:53,302 --> 00:43:53,976
Monica closed the book and put it back 
on the table. She walked to the window  

443
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:54,737
and looked outside. Everything was bathed in 
the sunlight. She touched the scarab round  

444
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:55,463
her neck and closed her eyes. She said to 
herself softly, "Now, I understand."
 
 
 
 

445
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:55,600
- THE END -
