CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,000
A telegram from Count Dracula

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,360
It was early autumn in the year 1895.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:23,000
Alfred Sackville-Jones and Lord Ernest Deboy were sitting in
front of an open fire in Alfred's apartment.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,640
On the table lay a heap of bones, all that remained of the
meal they had just eaten.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,480
Licking a finger, Alfred got to his feet.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:42,200
"Now after such a satisfying and filling meal, Ernest, my dear fellow, I suggest that we finish off with one of my
very special wines."

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:49,320
Alfred pulled the cork from a dusty bottle and filled a
glass with dark red wine.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,200
His eyes lit up as he passed the glass under his nose.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:03,440
"Perfect. Absolutely perfect! Maison D' Armignac 1880. I've
been saving it for a special occasion."

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,440
"Special occasion? What are we celebrating, old boy?"

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:16,200
"First of all, my birthday, which, of course, you completely forgot. And secondly, the end of another successful
adventure."

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,640
Alfred passed the glass to Ernest, who raised it in the air
with a smile.

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:31,880
"Sorry for forgetting your birthday, dear boy. I've got a hopeless memory. I'm not sure I even know my own birthday.
What age am I, anyway? Twenty-eight or twenty-nine?"

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:41,800
"You're thirty-three. And a liar. You have a brilliant memory. You know by heart everything about every bat that
has ever existed."

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,080
"Ah, now that's different."

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:54,000
Alfred, who worked for a newspaper called The Globe, and Lord Ernest had just returned from Norway, where they had
solved an unusual case.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,840
A Count and his family had gone to live in an old castle
that the Count's uncle had loft him in his will.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:11,640
However, after a week, a strange figure without a head and
dressed like a Viking began appearing at midnight.

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,440
The Viking roared as loudly as he could, and scared
everybody.

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Naturally, everybody in the castle was very upset, which was
why they asked Alfred and Lord Ernest for help.

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:34,960
As he drank his wine, Ernest looked out through the window into the streets of London, but all he could see was smoke
and fog.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,560
"You know, Alfred, old chap I have to admit that this is jolly good wine. You don't happen to have any more, do you,
by any chance?"

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,520
Alfred poured more wine and Ernest made himself comfortable
again.

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,000
"You know, I rather like this ghost-hunting business."

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
Ernest began to laugh as he lit his pipe.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
"What a hopeless actor that Viking was!"

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,400
"Quite terrible! I've seen better acting done by Great Aunt Agatha's church drama group. He sounded more like a mouse
than a monster!"

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,600
"What a devil! Imagine trying to frighten the family out of
the castle so that he could claim it as his."

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,000
"Well, we solved that case, which makes three so far this
year. I think we're becoming quite famous."

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:29,280
Alfred went to his desk and picked up the newspaper and looked admiringly at the headline: 'BRITONS FIND VIKING'S
MISSING HEAD.'

32
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,480
Suddenly he looked very serious.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,320
"Do you believe in ghosts, Ernest?"

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,560
"I'd like to, but I'm very much afraid they don't exist. A
pity really."

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,000
"Well, I'm not so sure."

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,880
Just then the doorbell rang, which made both men jump a
little.

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,360
"Who on earth can it be at this time of night?"

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,320
A minute or so later, Alfred's servant entered, holding a
telegram.

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
Alfred tore it open.

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
He disliked telegrams.

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,280
His eyes moved quickly down the paper.

42
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,280
A look of relief appeared on his face.

43
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,480
"You know, I think we're in business again, my dear Ernest.
It's from... guess who?"

44
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,000
"Oh, come on! Don't keep me in suspense!"

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
"Count Dracula of Transylvania."

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,760
"Count Dracula... Dracula... the name rings a bell."

47
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:34,280
"I believe you have got a bad memory, after all. Those pointed teeth, I'll never forget them as long as I live.
Enough to make your blood run cold."

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:46,600
"Teeth. Yes, of course, a handsome pair, all right. Perfect for sucking blood, eh? And those bloodshot eyes. What a
funny looking man he was! And what a frightful accent! He sounded like an old frog. Well, come on!"

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,920
Alfred held the telegram under the lamp and started reading:

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:58,320
"Dracula village 10th November 1895

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:18,200
Will always remember my visit to England and particularly meeting you and your remarkable friend who knows so much
about bats. I have bad news. I am dying and badly in need of your help. I wish to clear the Dracula name before I leave this world. Please come quickly.

52
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Yours,

53
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,840
Count Vlad Dracula."

54
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,760
Alfred noticed

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,320
the excitement on Lord Ernest's face.

56
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,200
"How about it then, old chap? Can you pack your bags by
tomorrow and be at the station by... em...? Let me see..."

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Alfred took the train timetable from the shelf and looked up
the departure times from Charing Cross to Dover.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
"7.32?"

59
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
"a.m. or p.m., old boy?"

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,960
"Why, a.m., of course!"

61
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,360
"Thought so. You know how I hate getting up early in the
morning."

62
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,640
"I can always go without you."

63
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,520
Ernest jumped up out of his chair.

64
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,120
"No, you will not! I wouldn't miss this for the world!"

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,320
"All right then. Meet you at the station at 7.15. And don't
be late."

66
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:12,560
Alfred took his friend to the front door and waited until a
cab appeared out of the thick fog.

67
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,000
The next day, on the train to Dover, Alfred was reading an
early morning newspaper.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,440
The headline on page three caught his eye.

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,960
"Ernest, look at this! 'VAMPIRE COUNT DEAD.'"

70
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,920
Ernest half-opened his eyes and looked sleepily at his
friend.

71
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
"What's that?"

72
00:06:36,120 --> 00:07:02,160
"'Count Dracula of Transylvania died this morning in his castle near Vilcea, Transylvania, after a short illness.'
Oh, and look at this. It says, 'A report from a reliable source says that before his death the Count had asked two British experts to clear his name.' Good heavens, news travels fast."

73
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,240
"Well, now that he's dead, I suppose there's no point in
going on."

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,280
The newspaper nearly fell out of Alfred's hands.

75
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:22,360
"What are you saying? I'm certainly not going back. Ernest, think of what you'll be missing. You might even get the
chance to see the Transylvanian vampire bat, in person."

76
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,440
Ernest's eyes suddenly came alive.

77
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,320
"All right. You've persuaded me."

78
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
"Wonderful, wonderful!"

79
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,360
Alfred lay back happily in his seat and allowed the rhythm
of the train to send him to sleep.

80
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,160
Suddenly he woke up with a start.

81
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,200
"Ernest! Do you think we've got everything we need?"

82
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
"You mean, passports and so on?"

83
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,120
"Well, no. I was thinking more of... em... protection."

84
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:57,560
"Let me see. I've got my Derringer, my buffalo knife and some rope. That should do. And, of course, I was twice
boxing champion at school."

85
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:06,480
"Well, yes, but I was wondering whether we should have
brought a cross with us, and em... maybe some garlic."

86
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,720
"I had no idea you were religious, old boy. And, as for
garlic, I didn't know you had French tastes."

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,600
Ernest burst into laughter, which made Alfred feel rather
silly.

88
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,520
So, he picked up his paper noisily and pretended to read.

89
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:36,120
Ernest just fell back to sleep, dreaming he was in a coffin
and meeting the vampire bat.

90
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
CHAPTER TWO

91
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,720
A Visit to Count Vlad

92
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,720
The journey across Europe was long and tiring.

93
00:08:45,720 --> 00:09:00,200
Ernest slept most of the day, waking at night to study the night life through the carriage window or read his favourite
writer, Edgar Allan Poe, while Alfred read endless books about famous people in Transylvanian history.

94
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,560
By the time they reached Vienna he knew all there was to
know about every Dracula back to the 16th century.

95
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:23,320
As the train made its way deeper into Dracula's country, Alfred was just finishing the fifth and last volume of
Complete History of Transylvania.

96
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:32,400
"Fascinating! It was partly thanks to him that the Turks didn't conquer the rest of Europe. They say he was a
fearless officer, loved by his men."

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,120
"Who on earth are you talking about, dear fellow? I wish you
wouldn't always expect me to read your mind."

98
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:53,760
"The first Dracula. Prince Vlad Dracula. A great chap. He had one little weakness, though. He enjoyed torturing his
prisoners by pushing sharp pieces of wood through their stomach or tearing their body apart."

99
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,680
"Charming fellow! It doesn't say anything about him drinking
their blood too, does it?"

100
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:08,880
"It seems that only the present Count enjoys, or should I say, enjoyed, human blood. Hard to believe really. Seemed
pretty harmless to me."

101
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,760
"It was those teeth of his. Not exactly what one would like
one's dear old granny to have!"

102
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,440
"Ernest, for goodness' sake, how can humans suck blood?"

103
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,280
"Just like vampire bats do, dear boy. Through holes in their
teeth."

104
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,240
"There's no such thing as a vampire human... is there?"

105
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
"That's what we're here

106
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,400
to find out, dear boy, isn't it?"

107
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:35,600
"Sometimes you can be quite absurd. Now, let me ask this
kind old gentleman when we are expected to arrive in
Vilcea."

108
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,080
An old one-eyed man looked out of the window and pointed to
the sky.

109
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,040
He looked at him out of the corner of his good eye and asked
him,

110
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,840
"Where are you going, stranger?"

111
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,560
"Castle Dracula. To help the Count with a spot of trouble.
It's a bit hush- hush, you know."

112
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,160
At the name Dracula the old man turned away from Alfred in
horror.

113
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,680
"Funny chap. He doesn't seem to like foreigners."

114
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:14,160
Four hours later, just as the moon was appearing above the
top of the mountain, the train pulled into Vilcea station.

115
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Alfred and Ernest, along with one other passenger, got off and walked to the entrance to find Dracula's servant, who
was supposed to meet them there.

116
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,960
"I hope he got our message. I don't fancy staying here the
night."

117
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Hardly had Alfred spoken than a crooked old man appeared
from the shadows.

118
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,680
His name was Gregory and he wore a black overcoat, black
gloves and a black top hat.

119
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,040
He spoke so quietly that Alfred had to bend over to hear
him.

120
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,360
"Aleferd Shackwill Gons and Lourd Ernist, I suppose."

121
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,040
"Just call me Alfred. I think it would be easier. It was
very good of..."

122
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,600
"Follow."

123
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Alfred and Ernest followed the old man to where a black
carriage and two black horses were waiting outside.

124
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:20,720
As soon as they had got in, the driver set off on the last
part of their journey to Dracula Castle.

125
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
Alfred was woken up by the sound of horses' hooves on wood.

126
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,320
The carriage had stopped on the bridge over the water
surrounding Dracula Castle.

127
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,640
Then, they passed under the thick stone walls.

128
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,040
By the dim light of the carriage, Ernest caught a glimpse of
the enormous old door.

129
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,560
"Did you see that, Alfred? A bat."

130
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,800
"You've got bats on the brain, dear boy."

131
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,400
"No, really, carved on the door. I'm sure it was a vampire
bat!"

132
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:00,040
When they entered the main building of the castle, the two servants were standing in deadly silence, ready to receive
them.

133
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,640
They too were in black, and their unsmiling faces looked
like carved stone.

134
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:15,160
Rodolfo, the Count's butler, was a giant of a man, and had a
large head with deep hollow eyes.

135
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:26,040
Mania, the cook, was about half his size and even older than
Gregory, with a shrunken head covered in thin white hair.

136
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:34,120
As Mania took them up to their room, the sound of their feet
echoed through the empty castle.

137
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,200
She said nothing, just grunted and puffed as she slowly
climbed the spiral stone steps.

138
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Finally alone, Alfred threw himself on the big four-poster
bed and felt the soft velvet covers.

139
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,480
"I don't know about you, old boy, but I've been looking
forward to this moment for weeks."

140
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,600
Ernest was wide awake and examining the room with his
candle.

141
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,560
"The silence is quite scary, isn't it? This place must be
full of ghosts."

142
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,040
"You can't scare me, old boy. I'm so tired, I'd even share
my bed with a ghost."

143
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,200
Just as he said that he heard a tap which made him sit up
with a start.

144
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:22,841
Old Gregory half-opened the door and held out a letter.

145
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,761
"Mr Aleferd Shackwill, a letter from my master."

146
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,161
"That's funny. I thought the Count was dead."

147
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,561
"I expect he wrote it before he died."

148
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:38,641
Just as Gregory had left, Ernest let out a cry from the
other end of the bedroom.

149
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:42,081
"You know, I think you've been given the Count's bedroom."

150
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,641
Ernest shone his candle on the portrait of the Count on the
wall.

151
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:50,841
The teeth were not visible, only the dark bloodshot eyes.

152
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:54,921
Alfred looked at the pillow where the Count's head once lay.

153
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:59,721
"Do you mean to say that the Count died... here?"

154
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:04,601
"Most likely, old sport. You wouldn't like to change beds,
would you?"

155
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:08,401
Alfred broke open the wax seal and began to read.

156
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:42,561
"Dear Alfred, I feel my life leaving me. We may not meet in this world. Whatever happens, come and see me when you
arrive. I will be waiting with a warm heart. I have committed a crime, but not the crime of which I am un used. The time has come for my shame and that of others to be shown to the world. Don't leave a stone unturned and remember, "you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink". Beware of the vampire bat and the Lover.

157
00:15:42,561 --> 00:16:00,121
I cannot go on. My mind and soul are preparing to leave for a better world. I leave the name of Dracula in your hands. I
trust him, as an Englishman and a gentleman, you will tell the truth and nothing but the truth.

158
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:04,401
Your honourable servant, Count Dracula."

159
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:11,881
Alfred looked up at the Count's portrait, and for a moment
In- thought he saw the mouth move.

160
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:18,321
"That portrait is almost alive. I'd swear I saw his face
move just now."

161
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:23,481
"Funny you should say that, old boy. The canvas seems a bit
wet."

162
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,241
Ernest rubbed the canvas with a finger.

163
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,801
"Looks awfully like blood."

164
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:32,921
"Blood! Can't be. Probably just paint. This damp climate!"

165
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:33,641
"Unlikely."

166
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:39,841
Ernest smelt the substance on his finger, but said nothing.

167
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:48,521
"Now, what do you think the Count meant when he said, 'Come and visit me when you arrive.' After all, he knew he was
dying."

168
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,921
"He probably meant visit him in his grave."

169
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:56,641
"You mean dig up his coffin won't be too difficult. They
only buried him a few days ago."

170
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,761
"Do you realize what you're saying?"

171
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:03,601
"Absolutely, dear boy. It might be more fun than sleeping in
those coffins they call beds."

172
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:07,241
"Oh, all right. When shall we do it, then?"

173
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:15,601
"I know you're dying to get down to work, but I'm quite tired. How about tomorrow night? We can talk to the servants
and find out more about the Count."

174
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,561
"Good idea."

175
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:19,761
Alfred yawned and started unbuttoning his shirt.

176
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:25,361
"By the way, did you mean it when you said you'd like to
have the Count's bed?"

177
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:28,281
"Yes, dear boy, but I'd hate to spoil your fun."

178
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,401
"No, no, really, Ernest old chap, I insist."

179
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,081
"Are you absolutely sure?"

180
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,601
"Quite, dear boy, quite."

181
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:39,241
CHAPTER THREE

182
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,561
The Man in the black Cape

183
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,961
Ernest leant over Alfred who was snoring peacefully.

184
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,121
"Boo!"

185
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:47,921
"Ah!"

186
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,881
Alfred screamed and sent the covers flying.

187
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,561
Then he saw Ernest.

188
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:56,281
"Oh, it's you."

189
00:17:56,321 --> 00:18:00,241
Ernest, who was fully dressed, handed him his dressing gown.

190
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:04,241
"Who did you expect it to be, dear boy? Count Dracula?"

191
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:14,081
Alfred looked over at the portrait on the wall, which, in the daylight, seemed even more alive than ever, the manic
eyes staring at him.

192
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,521
Ernest gave him his razor and a shaving brush.

193
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:35,241
"Hurry up, old chap. It's way past breakfast time, and we've got work to do. Now, I've done a little exploring. I got
Rodolfo to show me where the Count is buried. I'm afraid his English is a little basic, but he's got the general idea. Oh, you've cut yourself, dear fellow. Blood is running down your neck!"

194
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:40,401
As he took a handkerchief from Ernest, Alfred noticed the
Count's eyes.

195
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:44,281
Did they really light up at the sound of the word "blood"?

196
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:53,081
"The family graveyard is outside the castle, up a narrow path by the river. Beautiful spot; wouldn't mind being
buried there myself!"

197
00:18:53,081 --> 00:19:08,081
They went down to the dining room and sat at an enormous wooden table loaded with eggs, steak, cheese, liver and
fish, along with bread, butter, honey, jam and coffee.

198
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:15,281
During the meal, Mania and Rodolfo hovered over them like
enormous bats with trays of food.

199
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:22,001
Towards the end, old Gregory staggered in, carrying logs for
the fire.

200
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,081
Alfred saw his opportunity.

201
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,921
"Gregory, my dear fellow, can we have a word?"

202
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,561
Gregory grunted and came up to the table.

203
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:38,761
"Can you tell us a little bit about the old chap? The Count, I mean. By the way, it's awfully dark in here. Don't you
ever open the shutters?"

204
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:43,241
A look of horror appeared on the old man's wrinkled face.

205
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:48,321
"No, Sir Aleferd. Not since the mistress died."

206
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:55,841
"Oh, so he was married, was he? When did the good woman
die?"

207
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,041
"Forty-five years ago, Sir Aleferd."

208
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:08,441
"Forty-five years ago! Did I understand correctly? My
Romanian is a little rusty. Good heavens! Any children?"

209
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,841
Gregory looked down at the floor and then whispered a reply.

210
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:20,961
"I see. No children. And the Count never married again. He
must have been madly in love."

211
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:38,121
"Yes, quite mad. She was a very beautiful Gentle eyes and
long shining red hair. A tragedy! The Count was
heartbroken."

212
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:43,001
"Are you sure you won't sit down, old boy? You look a little
unsteady!"

213
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,281
Gregory appeared not to hear.

214
00:20:45,281 --> 00:21:03,681
"When she died, the Count swore never to see the light of day again. After that, he only went out at night, on
Warrior, his white horse. When there was a good moon and a clear sky, of course."

215
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:09,801
"Fascinating! Now how did these nasty rumours start about
that vampire nonsense?"

216
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,041
Suddenly Gregory became very excited.

217
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,601
"The master is... was... a good man!''

218
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,321
"I'm sure he was, old boy.

219
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:24,921
But all these dead people with funny teeth marks on their
necks... who or what made them?"

220
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:29,801
Gregory waved his thin old arms in the air.

221
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:33,001
"Not the master! Not the master!"

222
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,761
"Calm down, old chap! You'll do yourself an injury! I
believe you!"

223
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:44,121
Gregory got down on his knees and took Alfred's hand, which
Alfred found rather embarrassing.

224
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:50,961
"Sir Aleferd Shagwill Gons, I would die for the master."

225
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:59,081
"Quite sure you would, old boy. Fine. Now we're going to
need some spades. Any chance you could find us a couple?"

226
00:21:59,081 --> 00:21:59,961
"Spades?"

227
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:11,361
"Yes, you see, Lord Ernest wants to go looking for truffles. Well, no, actually we have to see the Count. He told us to
in his letter."

228
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:13,361
Gregory drew away from Alfred.

229
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,001
"It's the only way, really."

230
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:19,801
"All right, Sir Aleferd. But Rodolfo must not know."

231
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,561
Gregory looked round in the direction of the servants'
rooms.

232
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:32,121
"Oh, of course, we won't say a thing. And, by the way, could
you open the castle gates at about midnight tonight?"

233
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:36,841
"Yes, Sir Aleferd. Anything for the master."

234
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:43,041
That night, Alfred and Ernest met as planned near the castle
gates.

235
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:51,601
As promised, Gregory turned the wheel to let them out.

236
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:56,481
A strong wind had got up which roared through the valley.

237
00:22:56,481 --> 00:23:03,921
They followed the path with difficulty, as the moon kept
hiding behind large black rain clouds.

238
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:09,201
Every so often they heard the screech of an owl or some
other night creature.

239
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:16,441
As they entered the graveyard, the rusty old iron gate
squealed.

240
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:24,961
The place was sheltered from the wind by massive cypress trees and was as silent as all the Dracula's that lay buried
there.

241
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:29,441
Ernest pointed to a white marble gravestone.

242
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:30,441
"That's the one."

243
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:40,121
As they approached the Count's grave, he looked up into the sky at the pale light from the moon, which threw a white
veil over the crooked gravestones.

244
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:53,481
"It's a full moon. They say it was on such nights that the Count went looking for human blood. Well, here we are. Got
your spade, Alfred? Don't look so down, old boy. The exercise'll do you good."

245
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:59,961
The soil on the grave was loose and it was not long before
they had dug a large hole.

246
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:03,321
Ernest was the first to touch wood.

247
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:18,121
"Ho, ho! I believe we're about to meet the Count again. Is it just the moonlight or are you looking rather pale, dear
boy? I know it's well past your bedtime, but I wish you would be a little bit more enthusiastic about it all."

248
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:25,881
"Are you sure we ought to do this, Ernest? I know that I wouldn't like to be disturbed just as I had started my
eternal rest."

249
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:31,321
"You're forgetting, dear boy. He's not at rest. Now help me
take off the lid."

250
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:35,441
At that moment they heard a screech above their heads.

251
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,441
Ernest let out a cry.

252
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:41,761
"The vampire bat! I'd recognise that sound anywhere."

253
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:45,721
Ernest lit a candle and held it over the Count's head.

254
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:48,881
Now it was Alfred's turn to cry out.

255
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:55,601
"Oh, my God, his eyes are still open! Just like the
portrait!"

256
00:24:55,641 --> 00:25:05,961
"Stop staring and let's search him. I'm afraid we're going to have to turn him over. Just grab his left arm. That's
funny. I'd swear he was warm."

257
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:10,881
They searched the coffin but all they found was the Count's
silver cane.

258
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:16,721
"Well, look at that! The end of the cane is in the shape of
Desmodus Rotondus."

259
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,841
"I beg your pardon. Who's he?"

260
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:24,841
"The vampire bat. Look at those pointed ears and the teeth.
Just hold the candle a little closer."

261
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:27,761
"Ernest, this is not the time not the place"

262
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:35,881
"Beautiful piece of work. Nothing here though. Pity." They
rolled the Count on to his back again.

263
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,761
Ernest stopped dead.

264
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:49,721
"Look. His eyes are closed, and I think... yes, I'm certain. I believe he's smiling. I can see his teeth. And what's
that? Blood."

265
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:51,561
"Blood?"

266
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:56,601
"Oops. Sorry. I must have cut myself on a nail opening the
coffin."

267
00:25:56,601 --> 00:26:04,881
"This whole business is beginning to disturb me." They put the coffin back, covering it with soil, and made their way
back to the castle.

268
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:08,961
Just as they arrived, Alfred remembered something.

269
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:17,521
"Oh, dash it! I completely forgot to tell old Gregory to let
us in again."

270
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:20,841
At that moment, they heard the grinding of the castle gate.

271
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:31,081
When it was wide enough, a white horse charged out, ridden
by a man in a black cape and hood.

272
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:35,921
They watched in amazement as the figure disappeared into the
night.

273
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:37,601
Ernest grabbed Alfred's arm.

274
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:45,641
"You once asked me whether I believed in ghosts, old chap. Well, I have to say that I think I've changed my mind on the
subject."

275
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:53,881
"A ghost! What an article this is going to be! The only
trouble is The Globe won't believe a word of it."

276
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:57,961
They ran through the castle yard and up to their bedroom.

277
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:03,841
As he was taking off his cloak, Alfred noticed the Count's
portrait.

278
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:12,921
"Look, Ernest. The Count's face. It seems so much more
peaceful than before, almost happy."

279
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:18,961
"Who's imagining things now? It looks like an ordinary
portrait to me."

280
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:24,241
"That's exactly what I mean."

281
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:25,281
CHAPTER FOUR

282
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:27,641
Dracula's Village

283
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:34,041
The next morning it was Mania who served the two men
breakfast.

284
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:36,321
Rodolfo was nowhere to be seen.

285
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:44,481
Concerned, Alfred asked Mania where he was, but she was not
one to waste energy on words.

286
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:47,121
"Rodolfo sick."

287
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:56,641
"Oh, dear, poor fellow. It's the climate, awfully damp.
Almost as bad as England. Well, give him our regards, will
you?"

288
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,481
By the time he had finished, Mania had already shuffled out
of the room.

289
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:04,961
"A jolly nice chap Rodolfo. Takes life a bit too seriously,
but..."

290
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:10,121
"Alfred, don't dead people usually look sort of grey and...
well... lifeless?"

291
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:17,921
"Don't ask me. You're the expert on death, old boy. I like
to avoid it myself. Makes me feel rather insecure."

292
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:22,281
"The Count had red cheeks, as if he were alive. How very
strange!"

293
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:30,361
"He looked as dead as a doornail to me. Probably put rouge on him. Undertakers like to have their customers looking
their best on the 'big day'."

294
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:38,241
"Yes, maybe. By the way, I had a funny dream last night. We
were at the Dracula Cemetery digging up the Count."

295
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:40,961
"That was no dream, old boy. It really happened."

296
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:46,041
"No, no. Wait! We'd stopped for a rest and you were sitting
on a gravestone eating a sandwich..."

297
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:50,121
"Eating a sandwich? I'd never eat a sandwich sitting on a
gravestone!"

298
00:28:50,121 --> 00:29:02,201
"I know you wouldn't. It was only a dream. Anyway, suddenly the coffin lid began to open... very slowly, and out came
long white fingers with pointed nails followed by the head of the

299
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:34,201
Count, his eyes shining in the moonlight. When he was half out, he looked up at us, and his mouth opened in a broad
smile and I could see his teeth dripping with blood. Suddenly, he spoke in his funny Romanian accent, 'Welcome, my friends. I am happy....' But before he had time to finish the sentence, there was a horrendous screech and down flew a vampire bat, which landed on his shoulder. It was the screech that woke me up. Very unfortunate. I don't have many dreams and I really wanted to see how this one would end."

300
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:39,961
"I'm rather glad you didn't. You said 'scream'. About what
time?"

301
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:48,481
"I couldn't go back to sleep, so I lit a candle to read a bit of Edgar and I happened to look at my watch. It was
precisely 2.34. Why?"

302
00:29:48,481 --> 00:30:03,481
"Well, at about that time I heard a scream too. A long blood-chilling scream that seemed to rise from the very
heart of the castle. It sounded hollow, as if it was coming from the bottom of a well. Quite disturbing!"

303
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:06,401
"Yes, it was, rather. It hasn't affected your

304
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:07,401
appetite though."

305
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:16,441
"Quite the opposite. I haven't had an appetite like this for years. I do recommend this fishy stuff. Very tasty with
brown bread and butter."

306
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:23,081
"Alfred, old chap, this whole business is awfully good fun, isn't it? Screams in the night. Ghosts on white horses. What
next?"

307
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:33,001
"I must say you have an odd idea of fun. As for ghosts on horses, I'm not convinced. Though the resemblance was quite
astonishing, I must say."

308
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:41,241
"Well, I suggest we go into the village and try to get some information from the locals...just as soon as you've had
your fill of that fishy looking stuff. Ugh!"

309
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:54,521
"You should try it, old boy. Absolutely delicious. Ah, here's Gregory. I say, Gregory, would you be a good chap and
run us into the village today? Lord Ernest and I feel like seeing a bit of the local colour."

310
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,321
"Of course, Sir Aleferd."

311
00:30:56,361 --> 00:31:07,761
"I suppose you've noticed, Ernest, that I've joined the aristocracy. Sir Alfred... it sounds rather good actually...
Sir Alfred... em?"

312
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:08,921
The village was miles

313
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:16,601
from anywhere, cut off from the rest of the world by tall,
snow-topped mountains.

314
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:24,521
It was pouring with rain and the main street was deserted, apart from the occasional wet bundle running from one
doorway to another.

315
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:27,761
They decided to go straight for the inn.

316
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:37,801
Ernest pushed open the door and entered a dimly lit room full of heavy wooden tables, where some of the locals were
drinking and talking.

317
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:41,961
An oil lamp hung from the wooden ceiling.

318
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:47,961
When Gregory and the Englishmen entered, silence fell like a
heavy cloud.

319
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:52,681
Alfred raised his hand and smiled at the silent watchers.

320
00:31:52,681 --> 00:32:03,241
"Good day to you all. Frightful weather, isn't it? Jolly fine inn! My compliments to the landlord. Ah, my dear sir.
The barman, I suppose."

321
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:08,081
A large man with a red face and white apron was standing by
a barrel.

322
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:08,801
"Yes?"

323
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:24,041
"I'd like to buy these fine fellows a drink. And if you have a moment, I'd be grateful if you could give us some
information. I'm a journalist, and my friend here is a historian, and we're writing a history of the Dracula family."

324
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:28,721
At the sound of Dracula, heads turned towards the
foreigners.

325
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:32,841
"You'd better ask some of them."

326
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:35,161
The barman indicated the drinkers at the tables.

327
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:39,841
"Now, who'd like to have a little chat about the Dracula
family?"

328
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:42,361
No one answered.

329
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:49,561
After a minute or so, a young man with fiery red hair rose
unsteadily to his feet.

330
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:57,921
"You mean the 'vampire family'. I'll tell you about them.
Come over here and sit down,"

331
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:07,041
Ernest and Alfred pulled up two stools and sat opposite the
red-haired man, who seemed a bit drunk.

332
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,961
"Jolly nice of you, old chap."

333
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:20,641
"The Count likes human blood. Especially the blood of young women, just like his wife's, who died mysteriously years
ago."

334
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,801
"What do you mean 'mysteriously'?"

335
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:34,521
"She was found dead with tooth marks on her neck. It is believed that they were done by her husband. He killed her
then, just as he killed my sister last night."

336
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:38,561
"What did you say? Last night?"

337
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:57,121
"Yes, and she's still up there, with the marks on her neck for all the world to see. Count Dracula may be dead, but he
can still kill. My sister, my beautiful sister, she's dead and I'm certain that he killed her."

338
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,881
The man began to sob into his drink.

339
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:11,521
"Steady on, old chap. Sorry to hear about your sister. But
these are quite strong accusations. Have you any proof?"

340
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:15,321
Just then an old man, with a country face, spoke up from the
next table.

341
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:52,041
"That man doesn't know what he's saying. He's from another village. The Count was no vampire. He was a good man. He
loved the people of the village. I'll never forget the winter of '82'. It started to snow in September and didn't stop until April. The people were starving. What did the Count do? He opened up his stores to the people and kept all of us alive. He nearly starved to death himself. The Count is no vampire."

342
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:57,881
"Very interesting! So, how do you explain the deaths and the
teeth marks."

343
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:00,361
The man stopped for a moment and thought.

344
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:03,001
"The vampire bat."

345
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,721
Ernest suddenly showed interest.

346
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:08,881
He had learnt the word for vampire bat in Romanian.

347
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,281
'What's that about vampire bat?"

348
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:13,881
Alfred told him what the old man had said.

349
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:23,641
"I think we should go and see this young girl. I say, old fellow, you said your sister was killed by the Count. You
wouldn't care to prove it, would you?"

350
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:26,641
The drunken young man got to his feet and dragged them to
the staircase.

351
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:30,441
They stumbled up, the man talking to himself all the time.

352
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:42,521
"We had to bring her here. She was very ill. Coughing blood. This was the nearest village with a doctor, Dr Magorsky,
but..."

353
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:44,281
They reached the bedroom door.

354
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:51,961
Inside, they could see the body of a young girl laid out on
a bed with a sheet covering the lower part of her body.

355
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:56,521
A woman of about forty was crying beside the bed.

356
00:35:56,521 --> 00:36:03,561
On the other side of the bed, an old man in a black suit was
gathering up some surgical instruments.

357
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:07,001
The drunken man fell into the room.

358
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:11,841
"Look! Look at the work of the vampire Count!"

359
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:15,161
Alfred and Ernest saw a beautiful pale face.

360
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:20,121
On her neck were two red dots about an inch apart.

361
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:23,361
The old man turned angrily at the intruders.

362
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:26,281
"Who are you? Get out of here at once."

363
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:28,961
"They're friends of mine, Doctor. They didn't believe
that..."

364
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:34,121
"Well, now you know what a devil the Count was... and still
is; you can leave."

365
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:39,361
"Well, thank you, Doctor. I hope we shall have the pleasure
again."

366
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:41,361
Alfred wished to get out as quickly as possible.

367
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:46,841
Ernest, on the other hand, was quietly looking around the
room.

368
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:49,681
Alfred couldn't keep his eyes off the bloodless girl.

369
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:55,561
"I say, Ernest old chap. I think I need a drink."

370
00:36:55,601 --> 00:37:00,201
At the table in the inn below, Ernest was thinking.

371
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:08,521
"I didn't like the Doctor at all. Nasty piece of work.
Definitely not a gentleman. Did notice that scratch on his
hand?"

372
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:15,841
"I don't know what you're saying, old boy. As soon as we've
had this drink I suggest we get back to the castle."

373
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:16,441
CHAPTER FIVE

374
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:17,241
The Search

375
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:36,601
Back in Dracula Castle, Alfred and Ernest were sitting in front of a blazing fire after yet another wonderful meal,
this time of roast goose and apple pie with cream on top.

376
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:40,881
Alfred raised his glass of wine in the air.

377
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:45,801
"I would like to drink a toast to the Count and his superb
hospitality."

378
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:53,721
"And his excellent taste in wines. The old fellow certainly knew how to eat and drink well. As for Mania, she's an
absolute treasure."

379
00:37:53,721 --> 00:38:14,961
"You know, Ernest, I am a little bit worried. The evidence does not seem to be in the old chap's favour, does it? A
figure looking like the Count rides out into the moonlit night and two hours later a girl dies with two teeth marks on her neck. It can hardly be a coincidence now, can it?"

380
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:28,761
"The question is whether we believe in ghosts or not. As you know, I'd love them to exist, but my logic tells me that
they don't. Therefore, that person on the white horse could not have been the Count. So, who was it?"

381
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:35,321
"Well, it certainly wasn't Mania or Gregory. And the only
other person in the castle is..."

382
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:43,281
"Good thinking, old boy. Perhaps that's why he didn't serve us at breakfast yesterday. He was catching up on his sleep.
But why?"

383
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:46,641
"I can't help feeling that the answer must be in the

384
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:51,401
Count's letter. I've got it here. Let's see.

385
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:58,641
"Don't leave a stone unturned...' stone... we have to look
under stones...

386
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:02,041
"You can lead a horse to water...'"

387
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:09,721
Suddenly, a scream, just like the one they had heard the
previous night, was heard faintly echoing through the
castle.

388
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,521
Alfred shivered.

389
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:12,121
"Did you hear it?"

390
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:17,601
"I certainly did, old boy. And I think it came from
outside."

391
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:24,521
They ran out into the castle yard, but there was nothing to
be seen except the well.

392
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:28,561
They stood wondering where the sound could have come from.

393
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,161
Alfred pointed to the well.

394
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:37,561
"Do you see that enormous stone covering the well? How on
earth do they get the water out?"

395
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:41,361
"Interesting question, old boy. And what's that thick piece
of wood for?"

396
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:44,601
"Ernest, come here! Quick!"

397
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:46,441
Alfred was holding his ear to the stone.

398
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:48,561
"What is it?"

399
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:56,561
"I can hear something like an animal in pain, crying or...
no, it's more of a moan. Can you hear it?"

400
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:08,321
"Sorry. Can't hear a thing. I think your mind's playing tricks on you, old boy. It's probably the rumbling of your
stomach after that delicious goose. Let's get back inside. It's freezing out here."

401
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:19,001
Gregory was standing inside the door of the dining room with
a worried look on his face.

402
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,481
"Sir what is the matter?"

403
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:25,241
"Probably my imagination. I thought I heard someone scream."

404
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,721
"Ah, that was Don Juan maybe. He has bad dreams."

405
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,201
"I beg your pardon. Don Juan?"

406
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:45,841
"I mean Rodolfo. Don Juan is his nickname. He was loved by
many women, but he loved the master more."

407
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:59,201
"I see. By the way, Gregory, I've been meaning to ask you. Tell me about Dr Magorsky. Lord Ernest and I didn't take to
him very much."

408
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:11,921
"He was the Count's doctor, but he is an evil man. He uses
old medicine, the medicine of the witches. Herbs, leaves..."

409
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:18,281
"Nothing wrong with herbs. My Aunt Agatha swears by them."

410
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:24,521
"Frogs, snakes, bats and mice and other living creatures."

411
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:29,081
"Well, yes, I think Aunt Agatha would draw the line there."

412
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:44,041
"He bleeds all his patients. He says losing blood is good for you. But he does not care about health. He is a greedy
man, who loves only money."

413
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:50,721
"Thank you very much, Gregory old fellow. Bleeds his
patients..."

414
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:56,721
"Good night, Sir Aleferd. I am an old man and must sleep."

415
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:57,041
"Oh, of

416
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:00,841
course, old boy. Sweet dreams!"

417
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:03,961
Alfred told Ernest what Gregory said.

418
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:06,081
Ernest was intrigued.

419
00:42:06,121 --> 00:42:15,041
"It becomes more interesting by the minute. I suggest we go for a walk before breakfast, when our minds are clear, and
try and sort this out."

420
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:23,481
"Ernest, old boy, what has got into you? I thought you liked
sleep. I wish you'd have pity on me. I'm exhausted."

421
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:29,681
"My dear fellow, we're on a case. We can't waste time
sleeping."

422
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:36,041
The next morning, Alfred and Ernest got up early and went
out into the yard for a walk.

423
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:41,921
Through the thick mist they saw Rodolfo near the well
carrying a tray of food.

424
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:44,881
Alfred was surprised.

425
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:51,641
"That's funny. What's Rodolfo doing? I didn't ask for
breakfast in bed."

426
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:56,841
Rodolfo had laid the tray on the well top and was holding an
enormous piece of wood.

427
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,921
Alfred called out.

428
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:02,241
Rodolfo turned with a look of shock on his face.

429
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:14,562
"Bright and early, I see, Rodolfo. Or should I say, Don Juan? I wanted to ask you about this well top. How do you
get the water out?"

430
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:21,842
"The well is not used. The Count put a stone over it many
years ago."

431
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:26,282
"I see, what is that piece of wood for?"

432
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:28,122
Rodolfo seemed angry.

433
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:33,762
"This well is not used. The wood is rotten."

434
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:38,122
"Looks fine to me, but I won't argue with you, old fellow."

435
00:43:38,122 --> 00:43:40,202
"Now I must leave."

436
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:50,962
"Of course. Oh, don't forget your tray. Em, those eggs and that bacon look good. Perhaps we should have breakfast now,
Ernest."

437
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:54,922
Rodolfo took the tray and went quickly towards the kitchen.

438
00:43:54,922 --> 00:44:01,642
"Come on, Alfred. Stop thinking of your stomach and let's go
for that walk. I suggest we visit the Count."

439
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:02,842
"The Count?"

440
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:05,402
"Yes, I feel he may give us inspiration."

441
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:12,682
Dracula Cemetery was as quiet as an empty house.

442
00:44:12,762 --> 00:44:16,082
Even the birds seemed to have stopped singing.

443
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:21,202
Because of the thick mist, they could hardly see more than a
few feet in front of them.

444
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:24,082
Suddenly Alfred couldn't see Ernest anywhere.

445
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:29,562
"Ernest! Where on earth have you gone?"

446
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:32,162
There was no answer, just the echo of his voice.

447
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,442
He called again and this time got an answer.

448
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:42,362
"I'm over here, dear boy. At the Count's grave. And I've
found something rather interesting."

449
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:48,362
"Just keep talking, will you? In that way, I might be able
to find you."

450
00:44:48,362 --> 00:44:52,042
Finally, Alfred found Ernest leaning over the Count's grave.

451
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:58,962
"Do you think it's rather strange that there is no sign of our footsteps? It's as if the soil was taken out and put
back again."

452
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,162
"Don't forget; it rained last night."

453
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:05,842
"What I can't understand is why the Count told us in his
letter to visit him when he had nothing to tell us."

454
00:45:05,842 --> 00:45:15,442
"Hold on. I've just had an idea. You don't think that cane of his is hollow, do you? And that inside is a vital
message?"

455
00:45:15,442 --> 00:45:20,162
"My word, you're a genius, dear boy. Of course, it must be!"

456
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:25,482
"Oh, dear. Does that mean we have to do more grave-
digging?"

457
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:31,042
"Afraid so, old chap. But you're getting quite good at it.
By the way, have you been eating garlic?"

458
00:45:31,082 --> 00:45:42,242
"Garlic? Well, yes... em... I... thought it better to be safe than sorry. I got dear Mania to let me have a few
cloves for emergencies."

459
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:51,882
"The smell is enough to keep away the Devil himself. As for the vampire bat, he wouldn't dare fly within a mile of us.
Come on. Let's go and have breakfast."

460
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:56,562
They made their way back by the river to the castle gate,
which Gregory

461
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:58,322
had left open for them.

462
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:04,962
Alfred was still trying to work out the connection between
stones, water and horses.

463
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:25,122
"You know, Ernest. I feel that the solution to our mystery lies very close to that well. There's a big stone there,
with water under it, and opposite the stable where the Count's horse is kept. I'm sure the answer lies under that stone."

464
00:46:25,122 --> 00:46:29,282
Ernest touched Alfred's arm and held a finger to his mouth.

465
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:40,642
"Sh! Look, Rodolfo just got out of the well. And he's pushing the stone back by himself. Good heavens, he must be
as strong as an ox."

466
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:46,162
Through the mist they saw Rodolfo carrying a tray from the
well to the kitchen.

467
00:46:46,162 --> 00:46:50,162
Alfred slapped the side of his head in annoyance.

468
00:46:50,162 --> 00:47:14,842
"Dash it! I should have thought of it before. Don Juan was a great lover, wasn't he? What did the Count say in his
letter? 'Beware of the Lover.' Do you think Rodolfo could be 'The Lover? We'd better keep a very close eye on him and find out what's hidden down that well. Why was he carrying a tray?"

469
00:47:14,842 --> 00:47:19,682
"All this detective work has given me quite an appetite.
What about you, Alfred?"

470
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:31,202
"Oh, yes. And I think we deserve it. I feel we're getting
very close to an important discovery."

471
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:31,402
CHAPTER SIX

472
00:47:31,402 --> 00:47:32,962
The Missing Link

473
00:47:32,962 --> 00:47:40,962
That night Alfred and Ernest were too tired to go grave-
digging.

474
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:46,242
They decided, however, that they would keep a careful eye on
Rodolfo.

475
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:55,722
They felt that he, and in fact all three servants, were hiding something which might provide the key to the whole
Dracula mystery.

476
00:47:55,762 --> 00:48:09,842
So, next morning they got up early, before the mist had risen, and slipped out into the castle yard to wait for
Rodolfo to appear with his tray of food, as they believed he almost certainly would.

477
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:22,762
About ten feet from the well, Gregory had parked the carriage with the Dracula coat of arms and the head of the
vampire bat painted in gold on the side.

478
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:27,722
They decided that this would be a good place to hide.

479
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:30,042
Ernest looked at his watch.

480
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:34,602
"Do you think he's not coming? We've been here for nearly an
hour."

481
00:48:34,602 --> 00:48:38,242
"Perhaps he heard us come out and realised that we're after
him."

482
00:48:38,242 --> 00:48:40,882
"Well, let's give him another fifteen minutes."

483
00:48:40,882 --> 00:48:48,482
They waited another fifteen minutes and were about to give
up when they heard the kitchen door slam shut.

484
00:48:48,522 --> 00:48:50,682
"I think it's him."

485
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:57,402
Sure enough, Rodolfo appeared carrying the same tray as on
the previous day.

486
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:02,722
But instead of stopping at the well, he walked straight to
the carriage.

487
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:06,402
Ernest and Alfred began to feel uneasy.

488
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:13,682
However, when he reached the driver's seat, he stopped and
laid the tray on it.

489
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:21,482
Then, he returned to the well and, using the thick piece of
wood as a lever, pushed back the stone.

490
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:29,482
He came back for the tray and, to their surprise, climbed
into the well and disappeared.

491
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:32,722
Alfred whistled to himself,

492
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:36,882
"I think this is our opportunity. Let's follow him."

493
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:39,442
Alfred reached the well first.

494
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:46,442
He could hear the sound of Rodolfo's boots on the stone
steps as he went deeper into the well.

495
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:50,202
At some point, they seemed to just fade away.

496
00:49:50,202 --> 00:49:55,522
Alfred looked in, but all he could see was a black hole.

497
00:49:55,522 --> 00:50:03,202
"I say, I don't fancy getting in there. Looks like the way
down to Hell!"

498
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:05,922
Ernest struck a match and held it over the hole.

499
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:10,242
They could make out spiral steps built on the side of the
well.

500
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:21,602
There was nothing to hold on to, and the steps looked wet and slippery, so if either of them fell, he would almost
certainly go hurtling down to a sure death.

501
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,842
Ernest got into the mouth of the well.

502
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:26,602
"Be careful. The steps are all wet and slimy."

503
00:50:26,602 --> 00:50:35,682
Step by step they climbed down into the darkness, feeling
their way as best they could by leaning against the well
wall.

504
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:39,042
Suddenly, Alfred saw Ernest fall.

505
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:45,602
For a moment he thought he had seen the last of his friend
and he expected to hear the fatal splash.

506
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:50,282
Instead, he heard Ernest's voice coming from the well.

507
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:52,922
Then he realised what had happened.

508
00:50:52,962 --> 00:51:05,962
There was a large hole in the wall and Ernest had fallen into it and was now lying on the floor of what, by the looks
of it, was a passageway, which led somewhere underground.

509
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,482
"Are you all right, old chap?"

510
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:13,842
"Well, just about. I thought I was on my way to meet the
Count for a moment. Where the devil are we?"

511
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:25,082
"Your guess is as good as mine. The home of the vampire bat I should think. Hold on a tick. I can just make out a dim
light at the end there."

512
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:30,602
Ernest got to his feet and felt his way along the passage to
a door, which was slightly open.

513
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:37,522
Inside, they could hear Rodolfo's voice and the grunts of
some kind of animal.

514
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:40,362
Ernest pushed the door slightly.

515
00:51:40,362 --> 00:51:45,642
"There's only one way to find out. Let's go."

516
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:48,162
He opened the door just enough to see what was happening.

517
00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:53,842
Rodolfo had his back to them and was facing someone sitting
on a chair.

518
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:58,562
He appeared to have a spoon in one hand, feeding a baby.

519
00:51:58,802 --> 00:52:04,722
The room was warm and comfortable, with expensive Persian
carpets on the floor.

520
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:15,082
Rodolfo got up to put more wood on the fire, revealing the
ugliest creature they had ever seen.

521
00:52:15,082 --> 00:52:22,682
One side of its face was twisted and shapeless, and its arms
and whole body were all bent and moving out of control.

522
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:30,482
Uneaten food and meaningless sounds were coming out of its
mouth.

523
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:34,202
Alfred could not help exclaiming.

524
00:52:34,202 --> 00:52:36,682
"Good heavens! What is that?"

525
00:52:36,682 --> 00:52:41,202
Rodolfo was speaking to the creature as if it understood
what he was saying, but could not reply.

526
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:44,122
Alfred pulled Ernest's arm.

527
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,802
"I think we ought to go."

528
00:52:45,802 --> 00:52:53,442
Rodolfo must have sensed someone was there because he let
out a wild cry and started to run towards them.

529
00:52:53,442 --> 00:53:19,722
"You devils! Father said I should trust you because you are English gentlemen, but everybody hates the Dracula name and
you're no different. You want a story for your newspaper. You don't care about the great family Dracula. Well, I'm going to kill you."

530
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:32,002
Rodolfo reached the two men and was about to lift Alfred into the air, when Ernest threw his bolas, which was made of
thick string with three metal balls tied to the ends.

531
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:36,202
The bolas went right around Rodolfo's legs.

532
00:53:36,242 --> 00:53:41,562
Alfred was thrown into the air and Rodolfo fell forward onto
the floor.

533
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:45,002
Ernest threw the end of a piece of rope to Alfred.

534
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:49,362
"Here, grab the end of this and tie him up before he
recovers."

535
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:54,242
"Bravo, Ernest old fellow! Where on earth did you learn that
little trick?"

536
00:53:54,242 --> 00:54:01,122
"Didn't I tell you I spent three months with the rebels in Argentina fighting the Dictator? I brought that little
fellow back with me."

537
00:54:01,122 --> 00:54:06,202
Between the two of them, they managed to tie up the
struggling Rodolfo.

538
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:13,242
Ernest was afraid he was going to break the rope, but it
soon became clear that it was too strong for him.

539
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:19,242
When they had finally got him under control, Alfred started
to speak.

540
00:54:19,242 --> 00:54:29,362
"Now, Rodolfo, old fellow. I'm frightfully sorry to have to do this, but you simply must understand. We're here to help
you."

541
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:32,562
"No, you're just like the rest."

542
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:40,202
"Look, old fellow, why do you think the Count asked us over
here? Now I think you'd better tell us the whole thing."

543
00:54:40,202 --> 00:54:43,162
The creature in the corner let out an animal cry.

544
00:54:43,202 --> 00:54:50,962
"I suppose it was he who was making the screams in the
night. Who is he? I suppose it is a he?"

545
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:54,922
Rodolfo said nothing, just boiled with anger.

546
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,762
Then he spoke.

547
00:54:56,802 --> 00:55:09,682
"Well, you know now and I cannot kill you. So, I might as
well tell you the whole story. That is the Count's son."

548
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,242
"The Count's son?"

549
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:20,002
"Yes, he is forty-five years old. He should have died,
but...

550
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:21,682
"Hold on a tick!

551
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:28,162
Forty-five, but the Countess died forty- five years ago.

552
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:34,482
You mean that she died giving birth to that... that
gentleman over there?"

553
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:44,522
"Yes, Radu is the heir to the Dracula estate. He should now
be Count Dracula."

554
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:49,362
"Radu? That means 'handsome', doesn't it? Rather ironical."

555
00:55:49,402 --> 00:56:06,642
"Naturally, the Count did not want the world to know about Radu. It would be a great shame for the family. But he felt
great guilt for keeping him here in this... this hole. But Radu doesn't know any better."

556
00:56:06,682 --> 00:56:24,002
"Well, it looks as if you've let the cat out of the bag, Rodolfo. But don't worry. Your secret will be safe with us.
I won't even mention it in my article. I promise. Now, one thing puzzles us. Who is this Doctor Magorsky?"

557
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:35,082
"Doctor Magorsky is an evil man, but the Count was a naive
man and trusted him. I think he killed her."

558
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:36,642
"Killed the Countess?"

559
00:56:36,682 --> 00:56:43,042
"By bleeding her. This is what he does, to make people
better."

560
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:59,682
"I see. Fascinating! Oh, and one last little question, old boy, now that we've got you in this... em... difficult
position, so to speak. That was you we saw on the Count's horse the other night, wearing his cloak and

561
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,362
hood?"

562
00:57:01,362 --> 00:57:03,122
Rodolfo was silent.

563
00:57:03,122 --> 00:57:06,922
Then hesitatingly he replied. "... No."

564
00:57:06,922 --> 00:57:31,522
"Are you sure you weren't sleep-riding, old fellow? Because if it wasn't you, I daren't think who it was, unless it was
the Count himself. Now you must trust us. We can work together and sort this whole nasty business out. Our job is to clear the Dracula name and that's exactly what we will do."

565
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:35,842
"All right. I will help you."

566
00:57:35,842 --> 00:57:45,522
"Oh, what a jolly good fellow! Did you understand that,
Ernest? Rodolfo is going to help. I think we can untie him
now."

567
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:50,842
"Are you sure we can trust him? He could throw both of us
into the well with one arm."

568
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:56,322
"Well, perhaps you'd better keep your little handy just in
case."

569
00:57:56,402 --> 00:58:00,922
They first unwound the bolas and then the ropes from around
his arms.

570
00:58:01,002 --> 00:58:03,722
He made no attempt to attack them.

571
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:06,362
Alfred sighed with relief.

572
00:58:06,362 --> 00:58:11,282
"Well, I don't know about you two, but I'm starving. How
about breakfast?"

573
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:17,002
When Ernest and Alfred were having breakfast, Alfred was
still unsure of the situation.

574
00:58:17,002 --> 00:58:30,522
"There are still a lot of questions unanswered, aren't there, old boy? I mean, who was that chappy on the horse?
Now, we don't believe in ghosts. Or do we?"

575
00:58:30,522 --> 00:58:39,122
"I'm not sure we can trust Rodolfo. He may have been lying, or at least not telling us the whole truth. Might he still
throw us down the well or something?"

576
00:58:39,122 --> 00:58:48,962
"Oh, no, no, no. Rodolfo's a fine fellow. I think we need to
investigate the Doctor. All this bleeding! Nasty business!"

577
00:58:48,962 --> 00:58:56,722
"Well, in that case, I suggest that after breakfast, we get old Gregory to pop us into the village so that we can get to
the bottom of this Magorsky fellow."

578
00:58:56,722 --> 00:59:08,242
"Ah, Rodolfo, a superb breakfast as usual. I hope you didn't just accidentally drop a few spoonfuls of cyanide into the
coffee."

579
00:59:08,242 --> 00:59:11,202
Rodolfo did not reply or smile.

580
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:15,042
"Funny about foreigners. They can't take a joke."

581
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:16,242
CHAPTER SEVEN

582
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:19,522
Dr Benjamin Magorsky

583
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:23,522
They decided to go straight to the Doctor's house and face
him.

584
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:28,282
For some reason, Rodolfo insisted on driving them there.

585
00:59:28,282 --> 00:59:37,802
After a two-hour journey, they arrived at an iron gate leading into a large estate surrounded by a tall
glass-topped wall.

586
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:42,962
A well-kept drive led up to the Doctor's house.

587
00:59:42,962 --> 00:59:51,562
On looking out of the window of the carriage, Ernest was
surprised to see a large house with at least twenty rooms.

588
00:59:51,602 --> 01:00:04,522
"Take a look at that, old boy. He's not doing too badly for a country doctor. A house like that must be worth a
fortune."

589
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:06,402
The door was opened by a servant.

590
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:20,602
After a long wait, the Doctor who was still an extremely handsome man, with long silver hair brushed back on both
sides of his head, came into the room.

591
01:00:20,642 --> 01:00:24,002
Surprisingly, he spoke excellent English.

592
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:32,242
"I believe we've met before, gentlemen. Under less happy
circumstances. You're English, I believe."

593
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:36,082
"Yes, Doctor, we're doing a spot of investigating for the
late Count."

594
01:00:36,122 --> 01:00:41,282
"They tell me you've been asking questions that have been
upsetting some of the villagers."

595
01:00:41,282 --> 01:00:51,682
"Not at all, Doctor. People have been very happy to tell us all they know. It seems that these rumours about the Count
having a taste for human blood are totally unfounded."

596
01:00:51,762 --> 01:01:04,042
"I don't know who you've been talking to, gentlemen, but I can assure you that the Count was, and I believe, still is,
a vampire. You forget, gentlemen. I was his doctor."

597
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:12,682
"You say 'still is'. Do you mean to say that you don't
believe that the Count is dead? Or do you believe in
ghosts?"

598
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:24,122
"I believe he died, yes, but I also believe in his power to come back from the dead. In fact, I believe that vampires
are humans who have died and come back to earth."

599
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:30,882
"Very interesting, Doctor. But you say the Count was also a
vampire in real life?"

600
01:01:30,922 --> 01:01:31,842
"Yes, the

601
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:38,122
Count had very rare powers. I once examined his teeth at
some length, and..."

602
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:47,602
At that moment a shout was heard from the hall and all seven feet of Rodolfo came through the door into the sitting-
room.

603
01:01:47,682 --> 01:01:55,602
"That man is a liar. He is the vampire, not the Count. Tell
them how you..."

604
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:58,882
The Doctor looked at Rodolfo with an ironic smile on his
face.

605
01:01:58,922 --> 01:02:03,762
"You can't prove it. The Count never recognised you as his
son."

606
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:16,842
"Maybe not publicly, but I'm going to prove how you blackmailed the Count so you would keep his secret. You were
the only person who knew about Radu."

607
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:18,682
"Rubbish! Nonsense!"

608
01:02:18,682 --> 01:02:28,642
"I can get all the villagers to say how you forced large sums of money out of them and threatened to kill them if
they did not pay."

609
01:02:28,642 --> 01:02:31,082
The Doctor began to laugh hysterically.

610
01:02:31,082 --> 01:02:44,042
"This man is mad, absolutely mad. He needs to be locked up. And if he doesn't shut up soon, I shall call my men and have
him taken away."

611
01:02:44,042 --> 01:02:52,802
During this confrontation, Ernest and Alfred just sat and
watched, not knowing who was telling the truth.

612
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:58,322
Suddenly, Rodolfo came towards the Doctor and took him by
the shirt collar.

613
01:02:58,322 --> 01:03:02,642
He probably would have broken his neck if Alfred had not
stopped him.

614
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:07,922
"Gentlemen, there's no need to fight like animals. We're all
civilised here."

615
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:16,402
"Civilised? This doctor is an animal. He has killed
thousands by bleeding them to death."

616
01:03:16,402 --> 01:03:20,042
"Lies! Prove it, you monster."

617
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:22,042
Suddenly Rodolfo calmed down.

618
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:26,762
"Yes, Doctor Lover. I will prove it."

619
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:28,882
"You can prove nothing."

620
01:03:28,882 --> 01:04:03,322
"Yes, I can. Before the Count died he left me his diary, in which he wrote everything. When you killed the Countess with
your so-called medicines and your bleeding, not one day went by that the Count did not write down everything. How you blackmailed him, how you got rich by threatening the poor and sick, how you used the vampire bat to do your dirty work for you, how everybody hates you and fears you!"

621
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:11,442
"No one would believe it. They all think the Count was the
vampire. It's his word against mine."

622
01:04:11,522 --> 01:04:24,762
"You know very well that if it's a question of your word against his, the people will believe his. The people loved
the Count and never really believed the rumours."

623
01:04:24,802 --> 01:04:28,562
Suddenly a fearful screeching was heard from the next room.

624
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:31,162
Everybody except the Doctor froze.

625
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:36,442
"It's nothing, gentlemen. It's my falcon. He wishes to go
hunting."

626
01:04:36,482 --> 01:04:40,722
As soon as Ernest heard the screech, he showed great
excitement.

627
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:44,522
"Alfred old chap, this is the moment I've been waiting for."

628
01:04:44,562 --> 01:04:50,842
Ernest walked excitedly to the door and was about to open it
when the Doctor shouted at him.

629
01:04:50,842 --> 01:04:57,722
"Don't open that door unless you want to die, Lord Ernest. I
have specially trained them to go straight for the neck."

630
01:04:57,722 --> 01:05:05,602
"Doctor, you don't think I would come all the way from England and not see the vampire bat in the light of day.
After all I am a specialist."

631
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,402
"I warned you."

632
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:23,482
No sooner had Ernest opened the door than a loud flapping of
wings and the screeching of a starving bat was heard, and an ugly creature with pointed wings and a squashed nose, with black hairs sticking out of it, flew wildly at Ernest.

633
01:05:23,482 --> 01:05:33,482
Alfred screamed and ran to fight off the vicious creature, but by the time he had reached his friend, the bat had
already got its teeth in his neck.

634
01:05:33,522 --> 01:05:40,442
To Alfred's surprise, Ernest just stood there while the
creature got its fill from his neck.

635
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:42,962
Alfred did not know what to do.

636
01:05:42,962 --> 01:05:51,402
Soon, the bat drew out its teeth from Ernest's neck and sat
on his shoulder like a parrot or a tame bird.

637
01:05:51,442 --> 01:06:02,722
"Do you know, Alfred, old boy, I think this is the most exciting moment of my life! How many people back in England
can say that they came in such close contact with a Desmodus Rotondus?"

638
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:05,322
"But won't it kill you, dear boy?"

639
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:12,242
"Good heavens, no! Of course, if I were one of the Doctor's patients and it fed off me three times a day, I wouldn't
last long."

640
01:06:12,282 --> 01:06:18,802
The doctor stood in admiration listening to the man talking
about his bats so casually.

641
01:06:18,922 --> 01:06:24,722
"A beautiful creature, Doctor. But also a deadly one, if you
let it be."

642
01:06:24,722 --> 01:06:30,042
"You have them well trained, Doctor. You don't mind if I see
the rest of the family?"

643
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:36,162
At that, Ernest went into the Doctor's laboratory and looked
up at the ceiling.

644
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:43,682
Sure enough, hanging upside down on a wooden bar were four
more vampire bats.

645
01:06:43,722 --> 01:06:50,762
Alfred, by now, had wrapped a scarf around his neck and was
holding it tightly with both hands.

646
01:06:50,762 --> 01:06:55,922
"How many people have you killed, Doctor, to keep your
little family alive?"

647
01:06:56,042 --> 01:07:14,962
"Yes, they are my family. I love them more than any human being because they love me with all their heart. They are
faithful, not like women, who love you today and leave you tomorrow. All those people, they were going to die anyway. I couldn't save them. Nobody could."

648
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:21,242
"How can you be so sure, Doctor? I think we should let the
police decide on that. Don't you think, Alfred?"

649
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:24,922
"Absolutely, old chap. I suggest we go right now."

650
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:31,122
At that, they turned and left the Doctor, who was shouting
nonsense after them.

651
01:07:31,122 --> 01:07:38,442
"You can't do anything to me. They're just peasants. They're
all afraid of me. I have all the power."

652
01:07:38,482 --> 01:07:43,042
As they reached the carriage, Ernest turned to the Doctor.

653
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:53,922
"Well, goodbye, Doctor. It was a pleasure. We shall meet again soon. Oh, and one more thing, you won't need to feed
one member of your family tonight."

654
01:07:53,962 --> 01:08:08,002
When they were in the carriage, Alfred felt a little better and let his hands go from his neck, but he seemed very
concerned by the two pink spots on Ernest's neck.

655
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:12,762
"Are you all right, old chap? Horrifying experience!"

656
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:17,362
"On the contrary, dear boy. It was like a gentle kiss. You
should try it some time."

657
01:08:17,402 --> 01:08:22,762
"I think give it a miss, old fellow. stick to the female
kind."

658
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:33,562
"Now, what I'm worried about is what the Doctor will do to get his hands on the Count's diary. He'll stop at nothing.
I'll check my Derringer just in case. I think we'll be needing it."

659
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:34,242
CHAPTER EIGHT

660
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:40,802
The lover

661
01:08:40,802 --> 01:08:51,962
By the time they left the Doctor's it had begun to snow, and by the look of the dark clouds there was going to be a
storm.

662
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:56,162
So they decided not to go to the police that night.

663
01:08:56,202 --> 01:09:04,402
Anyway, Alfred wished to examine the Count's diaries first
to make sure that Rodolfo had got his facts correct.

664
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:10,922
Alfred had two things on his mind that he had not had a
chance to talk to Ernest about.

665
01:09:10,922 --> 01:09:19,762
He leaned towards Ernest so that he could be heard above the
noise of the carriage and the rising storm.

666
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:23,322
"Did you notice, Ernest, that Rodolfo called Magorsky
'Doctor Lover'?"

667
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:30,002
"I'm afraid I missed that, old boy. Why? Do you think that
the Doctor is the the Count mentioned in his letter?"

668
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:35,442
Suddenly the sound of horses approaching the carriage was
heard and then a shot rang out.

669
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:38,682
Ernest quickly stuck his head out of the window.

670
01:09:38,682 --> 01:09:42,722
Through the falling snow, he could see three riders.

671
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:51,202
"I think we're being attacked by the Doctor's men. I hope you're a good shot old boy, because it's the only gun we've
got."

672
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:56,242
Rodolfo was now going faster and the carriage was rolling
dangerously from side to side.

673
01:09:56,242 --> 01:10:00,882
Another shot rang out, and they heard a cry from Rodolfo.

674
01:10:00,882 --> 01:10:06,642
At that, Ernest started climbing out of the window, much to
Alfred's concern.

675
01:10:06,642 --> 01:10:10,322
"Be careful, old boy. They're out to kill."

676
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:12,802
"I'm afraid you're going to have to join me, dear fellow.

677
01:10:12,802 --> 01:10:15,722
You don't stand a chance of hitting any of them in here."

678
01:10:15,722 --> 01:10:19,162
So, both men climbed out on to the carriage roof.

679
01:10:19,162 --> 01:10:24,282
Rodolfo had been shot in the arm but was still able to drive
the horses.

680
01:10:24,282 --> 01:10:31,722
After nearly being thrown off the carriage three times,
Alfred finally managed to get onto the carriage roof.

681
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:35,082
He lay down on his stomach and aimed.

682
01:10:35,082 --> 01:10:39,562
His first shot knocked one of the riders off his horse.

683
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:41,802
Ernest looked around in surprise.

684
01:10:41,802 --> 01:10:46,202
"I say, well done! You never told me you were such an ace!"

685
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:51,522
The other two riders followed for a short distance and then
dropped behind.

686
01:10:51,562 --> 01:10:54,762
Alfred relaxed, but was not happy.

687
01:10:54,802 --> 01:11:03,802
"This doctor will stop at nothing to keep the world from finding out the truth. I think we've got a rather unpleasant
few days ahead of us."

688
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:08,002
"Jolly good show! I was beginning to think things were
getting rather boring."

689
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:13,962
They reached Dracula Castle without any further adventures.

690
01:11:13,962 --> 01:11:21,842
Rodolfo was bleeding badly, but Ernest, who knew quite a lot
about first aid, cleaned and dressed the wound.

691
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:28,242
While this was going on, Alfred thought it was a good
opportunity to get some straight answers from Rodolfo.

692
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:36,162
"Rodolfo, did I hear you say that the Count was your father?
And if so, why are you pretending to be his servant?"

693
01:11:36,162 --> 01:12:10,923
"I should have told you everything from the beginning, but I have learnt to trust nobody. I am the son of Mania. The
Count married her secretly. He brought a priest from far away so that no one would know. But the Count never treated me like a son, more like a servant. That made me bitter, and I hated the Count for that, but I loved him as my father."

694
01:12:10,963 --> 01:12:18,163
"I see, I see. Now what about Magorsky. Why did you call him
Doctor Lover?"

695
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:53,083
"It is a name he hates. When he was young, he loved a beautiful woman from Vilcea, and they were going to get
married. But she left him for another man, a rich man from the town, and after that people made fun of him by calling him 'The Lover'. It was that which made the doctor hate women, particularly young and beautiful women. I am sure now that 'The Lover' killed the Countess."

696
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:56,563
"Doesn't the Count mention it in his diaries?"

697
01:12:56,563 --> 01:12:58,563
"No, you see the

698
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:18,483
Count was such a kind man that he could not believe that others could be evil. He did not know how jealous the Doctor
was of him. He did not even hate the Doctor for blackmailing him. The Count was the kindest man."

699
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:21,643
"But you say he treated you badly."

700
01:13:21,643 --> 01:13:39,363
"Yes, you see my mother is not an aristocrat. She is nobody, and so I too am nobody, but I have the Dracula blood in my
veins. That is hard to accept."

701
01:13:39,403 --> 01:13:47,723
"Now this is all jolly interesting, Rodolfo, but who was that fellow on the horse the other night pretending to be
the Count?"

702
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:53,203
Rodolfo looked at the ground and his pale bony face went
red.

703
01:13:53,203 --> 01:14:23,763
"I lied to you. It was me. I have a confession to make. I helped the Doctor spread these rumours about the Count. I
would ride the Count's horse through the village whenever the Doctor told me to, so that everybody would think it was the Count. What I did was terrible, but I wanted to hurt the Count for the way he treated me."

704
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:41,203
"And it appears that you did. Well, there's no point in crying over spilt milk. The important thing is to keep those
diaries safe for the police and try and prove that you are the Count's son. Does he mention it anywhere in his diaries?"

705
01:14:41,203 --> 01:14:43,683
"No. I have read them all."

706
01:14:43,683 --> 01:14:59,163
"I can't believe that if the Count was such a kind man he would not recognise you as his son. We've got to search the
castle high and low. Ernest, do you have any ideas where the Count could have hidden a letter or a will or something?"

707
01:14:59,163 --> 01:15:03,283
Ernest, who was warming himself in front of the fire, looked
thoughtful.

708
01:15:03,283 --> 01:15:07,963
"Well, it was your idea really, old boy. You thought the
Count's cane might be hollow."

709
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:11,123
"Yes, of course. I'd completely forgotten."

710
01:15:11,123 --> 01:15:19,363
"Deliberately, perhaps? You don't share my interest in coffins, do you, old chap? So it looks as if we've got work
to do tonight."

711
01:15:19,363 --> 01:15:21,003
"In this weather?"

712
01:15:21,003 --> 01:15:30,803
"Sometimes Alfred, you surprise me. You call yourself a reporter, and yet you like putting things off. Yes, tonight!
Not that I think we'll see the vampire bat, I'm afraid. It's too cold."

713
01:15:30,803 --> 01:15:33,643
"Well, at least that's one good thing."

714
01:15:33,683 --> 01:15:36,683
After supper they again set out with spades.

715
01:15:36,683 --> 01:15:42,843
This time Rodolfo came with them, though he had a great fear
of ghosts.

716
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:48,083
The snow was falling in large flakes, and the wind was
bitterly cold.

717
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:55,803
By the time they reached the cemetery, everything was so
white that they could see their way without lamps.

718
01:15:55,803 --> 01:16:00,683
It took them about half an hour to dig down to the Count's
coffin.

719
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:06,083
At the sound of his spade on the coffin, Rodolfo jumped out
of the grave.

720
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:11,083
"I am sorry Sir Alfred, but the rest you must do alone."

721
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:23,203
"I agree with you, old fellow. I can't stand this part. To tell you the truth, I just keep my eyes closed. I leave it
all to Ernest. He enjoys it."

722
01:16:23,283 --> 01:16:29,123
The snow was falling so fast that already a white layer
covered the top of the coffin.

723
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:32,123
Ernest was removing the lid.

724
01:16:32,123 --> 01:16:35,363
"I wonder if we'll see the end of my dream?"

725
01:16:35,363 --> 01:16:38,923
"Have the white fingers started to appear then?"

726
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:42,123
Ernest laughed and pulled off the lid.

727
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:45,083
Ernest could not believe his eyes.

728
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:49,963
The Count's face seemed younger and more alive than ever.

729
01:16:49,963 --> 01:16:52,003
And the eyes had opened again.

730
01:16:52,003 --> 01:16:56,163
For a moment he thought the Count was going to speak.

731
01:16:56,163 --> 01:17:00,843
"Alfred, can you help me turn the Count? I the cane."

732
01:17:00,843 --> 01:17:02,363
"Do I have to?"

733
01:17:02,363 --> 01:17:07,963
They both lifted the Count over and underneath found the
cane.

734
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:15,483
"That's funny. I thought I left the cane on top of him. Ah,
well, let's see if all this was a waste of time or not."

735
01:17:15,483 --> 01:17:18,683
Ernest began to unscrew the handle.

736
01:17:18,683 --> 01:17:23,243
When he had finished, he turned it over and tapped the end.

737
01:17:23,243 --> 01:17:28,083
Sure enough, a piece of thick paper fell out the end.

738
01:17:28,163 --> 01:17:31,723
"Bingo! What does it say on the top, Alfred?"

739
01:17:31,723 --> 01:17:39,603
"I can only just see but... Yes, 'Lastwill and testament'...
I think."

740
01:17:39,643 --> 01:17:44,883
"Wonderful! Let's put the Count back to rest, hopefully for
the last time."

741
01:17:44,883 --> 01:17:50,363
When they had got him laid on his back, Ernest noticed
something very strange.

742
01:17:50,363 --> 01:17:55,283
"Good heavens! His eyes have closed, and his face..."

743
01:17:55,283 --> 01:17:56,683
"What about it?"

744
01:17:56,683 --> 01:18:06,243
"It actually looks dead this time, but it's as if he's smiling. I believed in ghosts, I'd swear that he knew
everything that has gone on in the last few days."

745
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:08,923
"But you don't, do you, Ernest?"

746
01:18:09,043 --> 01:18:10,163
CHAPTER NINE

747
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:11,083
The Will

748
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:29,003
Back at the castle, Rodolfo immediately went to tell his old
mother the news and they all gathered around the fire, while Alfred read the will, translating it for Ernest as he went.

749
01:18:29,043 --> 01:19:12,283
"In this, my last will and testament, I wish to undo a wrong I committed many years ago. I married a good and kind woman
below my position, my excuse being that like all men, I needed human warmth and comfort. My greatest crime was being ashamed of it and never recognising the fruit of that marriage, my son, Rodolfo. In this will I ask his forgiveness and leave everything to him, declaring that he has the right to call himself Count Dracula. As for my first-born, the unfortunate Radu, I know that Rodolfo will take care of him as long as he lives.

750
01:19:12,323 --> 01:19:25,163
I have taken this will to my grave, with the knowledge that if it is ever found, it will be because the Dracula name has
been cleared of all the lies spread by that evil Doctor 'Lover' Magorsky.

751
01:19:25,203 --> 01:19:36,043
I wish to thank Alfred Sackville-Jones and Lord Ernest Deboy for helping my son Rodolfo to get what is rightfully his. I
can now rest in peace.

752
01:19:36,123 --> 01:19:39,523
Count Vlad Dracula."

753
01:19:39,563 --> 01:19:45,523
Alfred looked up from the handwritten letter with the
Dracula seal and the Count's

754
01:19:45,523 --> 01:19:47,243
elaborate signature at the bottom.

755
01:19:47,243 --> 01:19:52,603
"Well, Rodolfo old fellow, we shall have to call you Count
from now on."

756
01:19:52,603 --> 01:20:04,243
Rodolfo was so overjoyed that he got up and lifted his ancient mother into the air and kissed her a hundred times
on her wrinkled old face so that she actually smiled.

757
01:20:04,243 --> 01:20:10,523
Gregory too was jumping up and down, doing some sort of
strange Romanian dance.

758
01:20:10,563 --> 01:20:17,683
Having put his mother down, Rodolfo then came and gave
Alfred and Ernest kisses on both cheeks.

759
01:20:17,683 --> 01:20:26,643
"May I suggest, Count, that we open one of the late Count's excellent bottles of German wine? I think this calls for a
celebration."

760
01:20:26,683 --> 01:20:31,403
So, the five of them celebrated to the early hours.

761
01:20:31,403 --> 01:20:36,523
They even got Ernest to join in singing some traditional
Romanian songs.

762
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:43,043
Of course, Alfred knew that many dangers lay ahead, but he
did not wish to spoil the fun.

763
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:55,323
Next morning, as usual, Alfred first said good morning to the portrait of the Count, whose cheeks were all rosy red,
as if he too had drunk a little too much the night before.

764
01:20:55,323 --> 01:21:04,043
Then, he looked out of the window over the castle walls
across to the river and down Dracula Valley.

765
01:21:04,043 --> 01:21:09,403
The storm was over, but the snow was at least two feet deep.

766
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:12,883
Ernest was still fast asleep.

767
01:21:12,883 --> 01:21:20,523
Now that he had no coffins to visit or vampire bats to see,
the exciting part was over for him.

768
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:22,843
Alfred shook him.

769
01:21:22,843 --> 01:21:25,363
"Wake up, old boy!"

770
01:21:25,403 --> 01:21:32,643
"Alfred really, why do you always have to interrupt my dream
at the most exciting moment? I can see I'll never get to the end."

771
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:44,003
"Come on. We've got a long day ahead of us. First, we've got to bring these documents to the authorities. And I'm sure
that the Doctor's men are already on the road and will probably do anything to stop us."

772
01:21:44,003 --> 01:21:51,723
The snow was too deep for the carriage, so Rodolfo rode
Warrior, while Alfred and Ernest took a carriage horse each.

773
01:21:51,763 --> 01:22:03,083
As they were not sure that they would be returning to the Castle, they took a bag full of their belongings and said
goodbye to Mania and Gregory, who both had tears in their eyes.

774
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:08,643
Alfred paid one last visit to their room and said goodbye to
the portrait on the wall.

775
01:22:08,643 --> 01:22:12,283
He was almost certain he saw the lips move.

776
01:22:12,323 --> 01:22:18,883
As they rode out of Dracula's Castle, the silence was
immense.

777
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:26,043
All that could be heard was the muffled sounds of the river
near the cemetery where the waterfall was.

778
01:22:26,043 --> 01:22:30,803
About a mile out, Alfred turned to Rodolfo.

779
01:22:30,803 --> 01:22:36,243
"If the Doctor's men try to attack us, where is the most
likely spot?"

780
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:44,723
"Either where the valley narrows or where we have to cross
the river about a mile out of Vilcea."

781
01:22:44,723 --> 01:22:53,083
They said little, just kept their eyes on the hills and
trees around them where a man with a gun might be hiding.

782
01:22:53,083 --> 01:23:02,843
The Doctor's men were not waiting at the narrow pass, which surprised Rodolfo, and he wondered whether the Doctor was
going to attack them after all.

783
01:23:02,843 --> 01:23:10,163
Alfred, however, was sure that he would, and so, when they
were halfway across the river, he stopped.

784
01:23:10,163 --> 01:23:15,763
"Gentlemen, get your guns ready."

785
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:19,643
No sooner had he spoken than a gun appeared from behind a
tree and a shot rang out.

786
01:23:19,643 --> 01:23:23,203
The bullet whistled past Ernest's ear.

787
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:26,603
"Good heavens! That was close."

788
01:23:26,603 --> 01:23:29,443
They jumped off their horses and ran for shelter.

789
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:32,403
They could now see that there were three attackers.

790
01:23:32,403 --> 01:23:37,203
Ernest, who had more experience fighting than the others,
took charge.

791
01:23:37,243 --> 01:23:41,563
"Rodolfo, is it possible to cross the river at any other
point?"

792
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:46,163
"About a half a mile farther up, but there is no road."

793
01:23:46,163 --> 01:23:51,883
"If you'll let me have Warrior, I'll manage it all right.
You keep them busy while I approach from behind."

794
01:23:51,883 --> 01:23:59,763
So Ernest got up on the beautiful white horse, which was
almost invisible in the snow, and rode off up the river.

795
01:23:59,763 --> 01:24:07,283
About half an hour later, a shot rang out and they saw a
body fall from behind one of the trees.

796
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:09,563
Alfred saw his chance.

797
01:24:09,563 --> 01:24:16,163
"Rodolfo, let's get to the other side. Ernest won't give
them any time to think about us."

798
01:24:16,203 --> 01:24:18,763
Two minutes later they were on the other side.

799
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:26,163
By this time, Ernest had hit another and the third had laid
down his gun and was holding up a white handkerchief.

800
01:24:26,163 --> 01:24:28,843
Ernest appeared from behind a tree, followed by Warrior.

801
01:24:28,843 --> 01:24:33,603
"Well, that wasn't too difficult."

802
01:24:33,603 --> 01:24:38,403
Then, out of the corner of his eye, Alfred saw a movement.

803
01:24:38,443 --> 01:24:42,323
It was the wounded man who was pointing his gun at Rodolfo.

804
01:24:42,363 --> 01:24:44,763
"Rodolfo, get down!"

805
01:24:44,763 --> 01:24:45,843
But is was too late.

806
01:24:45,843 --> 01:24:51,763
Rodolfo fell to the ground, his blood spilling onto the
white snow.

807
01:24:51,803 --> 01:24:54,923
Ernest pointed his gun and shot the man.

808
01:24:54,923 --> 01:25:04,683
Ernest examined Rodolfo and found that he was still breathing, but the bullet had entered his chest and he was
bleeding badly.

809
01:25:04,723 --> 01:25:15,003
"We've got to get him to Vilcea quickly. Alfred, throw the men's guns into the river and get that man to put the dead
men on to a horse. Then let's get going."

810
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,643
They reached Vilcea about twenty minutes later.

811
01:25:17,683 --> 01:25:21,963
Ernest held Rodolfo in his arms and rode into Vilcea on
Warrior.

812
01:25:21,963 --> 01:25:29,003
At the first inn, they got Rodolfo on to a bed and Ernest
set to work, trying to save his life.

813
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:34,603
Two hours later, Ernest had managed to get the bullet out
and the wound dressed.

814
01:25:34,603 --> 01:25:37,523
Alfred looked on in admiration.

815
01:25:37,563 --> 01:25:41,403
"I had no idea you were such an expert, dear boy."

816
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:49,363
"Oh, did I never tell you I studied medicine for two years before turning to archaeology? You know, I think I would
have made quite a good doctor."

817
01:25:49,363 --> 01:25:54,363
"I suppose it's all that blood you like, dear fellow. What
are Rodolfo's chances of pulling through?"

818
01:25:54,363 --> 01:25:59,203
"Oh, he'll live, but it may take a few days before he can
get back on to his feet."

819
01:25:59,203 --> 01:26:01,443
Suddenly they heard Rodolfo's voice.

820
01:26:01,483 --> 01:26:08,843
"Sir Alfred, get the Mayor and the Police Chief to come. I
want witnesses."

821
01:26:08,883 --> 01:26:10,683
"Straight away, old fellow."

822
01:26:10,683 --> 01:26:17,083
Seeing Ernest's bare and bloody arms, Rodolfo realised that
it was he who had saved his life.

823
01:26:17,123 --> 01:26:23,203
"Lord Ernest, I now owe you a life. How can I repay you?"

824
01:26:23,363 --> 01:26:29,643
"One day, Count, I'd like to spend some time at the castle,
just going through the archives. Would that be all right?"

825
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:32,763
"Anything, Lord Ernest, anything."

826
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:42,003
Half an hour later, the Mayor and the Police Chief arrived
and the documents were formally handed over.

827
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:45,803
It was now up to the authorities to deal with Doctor
Magorsky.

828
01:26:45,883 --> 01:26:47,323
Alfred was thinking.

829
01:26:47,363 --> 01:26:50,443
"It looks as if our job is over, Ernest old fellow."

830
01:26:50,443 --> 01:26:55,883
"I'd really love to see those vampire bats again. Can't I go
with the police to arrest the Doctor?"

831
01:26:55,923 --> 01:27:05,963
"First of all, we don't know where the Doctor is. He is probably hiding by now. And his main aim now will be to kill
us, not Rodolfo, before we get back to England and publish everything."

832
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:07,163
"Quite so, old boy."

833
01:27:07,163 --> 01:27:13,923
"Rodolfo's in good hands. So I suggest we get out of here as
quickly as possible. We have a long journey ahead of us."

834
01:27:13,923 --> 01:27:17,003
"I'm going to miss this place, Alfred old fellow, it suits
me."

835
01:27:17,043 --> 01:27:26,883
"I can't altogether agree with you, old boy. But I do believe Rodolfo will make a very good Count. I always
thought he was a very solid chap."

836
01:27:26,883 --> 01:27:27,483
CHAPTER TEN

837
01:27:27,483 --> 01:27:27,923
The end?

838
01:27:27,923 --> 01:27:48,043
Alfred and Ernest said goodbye to Rodolfo, who could not thank them enough, and caught the 3.30 from Vilcea to
Craiova, where they planned to pick up the train to Vienna.

839
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:57,243
They, of course, had no news of the Doctor and wondered whether he would use his money and power to send a team to
try to kill them.

840
01:27:57,243 --> 01:28:01,363
Strangely enough, it was Ernest who was most concerned.

841
01:28:01,403 --> 01:28:10,083
"Do you know, Alfred old fellow, we're not home and dry yet! It was we who uncovered his evil deeds, and he's not the
type who forgives easily."

842
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:15,523
"Do you really think he'll send some of his killers after
us? Why would he bother?"

843
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:21,123
"It's a question of pride and honour. And these foreign
fellows think such things are terribly important."

844
01:28:21,123 --> 01:28:24,403
Alfred had great difficulty thinking of danger.

845
01:28:24,403 --> 01:28:30,443
He was already imagining himself back in his room in London.

846
01:28:30,443 --> 01:28:32,883
"What's the first thing you'll do when you get back,
Ernest?"

847
01:28:32,883 --> 01:28:41,203
"What a question! Let me see. Yes, I think I'll open a
bottle of your finest wine, dear boy. What'll you do?"

848
01:28:41,203 --> 01:28:47,043
"I'll go for a walk through the fog of London and stand on
Tower Bridge and watch the boats go underneath."

849
01:28:47,043 --> 01:28:48,923
Ernest laughed.

850
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:54,283
"Really, Alfred, you're such a sentimentalist."

851
01:28:54,323 --> 01:29:01,003
They arrived in Craiova at about 6:00 and had to wait an
hour for their connection.

852
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:06,803
They were waiting on the crowded platform when Alfred saw a
man he thought he recognised.

853
01:29:06,803 --> 01:29:16,523
"Ernest, do you see that man over by the entrance? The one with the beard and the scar above his left eye. Does he ring
a bell?"

854
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:18,843
"Don't think so, old fellow."

855
01:29:18,843 --> 01:29:20,483
"Probably my imagination."

856
01:29:20,483 --> 01:29:27,163
However, Alfred kept an eye on him and noticed that he too
got on the train to Vienna.

857
01:29:27,163 --> 01:29:30,443
There was something suspicious about him.

858
01:29:30,483 --> 01:29:35,643
He was dressed like a man of wealth, but looked like a
boxer.

859
01:29:35,683 --> 01:29:46,443
It was about 4.45 in the morning and they were about halfway
to Vienna when the first attempt on their lives was made.

860
01:29:46,483 --> 01:29:53,883
Ernest was fast asleep and snoring so loudly that he was
keeping Alfred awake.

861
01:29:53,883 --> 01:30:00,163
The door of their cabin opened, allowing a strip of light to
enter.

862
01:30:00,163 --> 01:30:05,363
Alfred opened his eyes for a second and saw the man with the
beard.

863
01:30:05,363 --> 01:30:11,883
He was holding a piece of rope in his hands and was
obviously intending to strangle them both.

864
01:30:11,883 --> 01:30:18,603
Alfred wished he had put the Derringer under his pillow, and
also that Ernest was not fast asleep.

865
01:30:18,603 --> 01:30:25,123
He decided to wait and grab the man by the legs as soon as
he got close enough to the bunk bed.

866
01:30:25,123 --> 01:30:32,123
Alfred was about to jump when he heard the man grunt and
fall to the floor of the compartment.

867
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:37,043
Ernest switched on the light and looked at the man lying on
the floor, apparently dead.

868
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:44,083
"It looks as if I saved your life, Alfred old fellow. It's a
good thing I don't sleep as deeply as you do."

869
01:30:44,163 --> 01:30:45,203
"But I don't."

870
01:30:45,203 --> 01:30:46,283
"Don't what?"

871
01:30:46,283 --> 01:30:50,723
"Sleep soundly. You were the one snoring. I was wide awake."

872
01:30:50,763 --> 01:30:52,443
"Snoring? Was I really?"

873
01:30:52,443 --> 01:30:53,723
Ernest looked at the body.

874
01:30:53,723 --> 01:31:08,083
"I'm afraid I broke his neck. Well, what can a chap do if another chap tries to strangle him in the middle of the
night? I suppose we'll have to explain this mess to the guard."

875
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:11,443
For the next two days, nothing unusual happened.

876
01:31:11,443 --> 01:31:17,843
It wasn't until they were outside Paris that the next
attempt on their lives was made.

877
01:31:17,883 --> 01:31:23,403
They had got to know another passenger, a German by the name
of Wolf Heinz.

878
01:31:23,403 --> 01:31:30,403
He said he was an ornithologist and was on his way to
England to study a bird species there.

879
01:31:30,523 --> 01:31:39,963
Ernest, however, was quite suspicious because that particular species of bird wouldn't arrive in England for
another two months.

880
01:31:39,963 --> 01:31:43,683
It all happened when they were having tea and cakes in the
dining car.

881
01:31:43,763 --> 01:31:48,603
Herr Heinz had arrived first and had already ordered.

882
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:53,403
Alfred was delighted to see the cherry cakes and tea
waiting.

883
01:31:53,403 --> 01:31:57,483
"I say, Wolf, old chap. Jolly nice of you!"

884
01:31:57,483 --> 01:32:01,883
They sat down and Wolf offered them a cake each.

885
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:09,003
Ernest noticed that they smelt strongly of almond and
suspected that Wolf had put cyanide in some of them.

886
01:32:09,043 --> 01:32:16,163
Rather than cause a fuss, he pretended to knock the cake out
of Alfred's hand.

887
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:26,163
"Frightfully sorry, old fellow! How clumsy of me! Good
heavens! Look out there! That bird. Very unusual. What is
it?"

888
01:32:26,163 --> 01:32:35,883
Wolf looked out of the window and tried hard to see the bird, during which time Ernest changed his cake for the one
on Wolf's plate.

889
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:40,243
Then he winked at Alfred so that he understood what was
happening.

890
01:32:40,243 --> 01:32:42,083
"Oh, dear, it must have flown away."

891
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:54,843
When he turned round, Alfred and Ernest were pretending to be finishing off their cakes, which Ernest had put into his
pocket.

892
01:32:54,843 --> 01:33:01,123
"What lovely cakes, Wolf!" Wolf joined in and ate his.

893
01:33:01,163 --> 01:33:06,203
On arrival in Paris, they saw an empty coffin arrive and
leave with a body in it.

894
01:33:06,243 --> 01:33:10,083
Ernest looked at Alfred and smiled.

895
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:15,443
"Poor Wolf! And they did look like awfully nice cakes!"

896
01:33:15,443 --> 01:33:43,763
When they got off the train at Charing Cross they really felt their adventure had ended, but they did not see the
young man get into the cab behind them and follow them all the way.

897
01:33:43,763 --> 01:33:47,523
Suddenly, a shot rang out.

898
01:33:47,563 --> 01:33:50,763
Alfred pushed Ernest to the ground.

899
01:33:50,763 --> 01:33:54,563
A man was standing on the pavement, pointing a gun at them.

900
01:33:54,603 --> 01:33:57,003
Ernest was quite annoyed.

901
01:33:57,003 --> 01:34:02,003
"Dear me! And I was so looking forward to a nice cup of
English tea."

902
01:34:02,043 --> 01:34:06,963
The man in the street looked mad, his eyes moving wildly in
his head.

903
01:34:07,003 --> 01:34:11,643
"You ruined my father! You will pay for this!"

904
01:34:11,643 --> 01:34:19,283
But by the time he had finished his last sentence, Ernest had got out his Derringer and had shot him straight through
the heart.

905
01:34:19,283 --> 01:34:23,363
They ran to the body, now lying in a pool of blood.

906
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:29,763
In his pocket, Alfred found a passport with the name Nikolai
Magorsky.

907
01:34:29,763 --> 01:34:35,123
"Really, these foreign fellows are hot-blooded, aren't
they?"

908
01:34:35,123 --> 01:34:37,803
Ernest was more concerned about the body.

909
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:41,363
"Now how are we going to explain this to the police?"

910
01:34:41,363 --> 01:34:47,803
For the next three months, Alfred and Ernest went everywhere
looking over their shoulder.

911
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:52,283
But it appeared that Nikolai was the last assassin.

912
01:34:52,323 --> 01:34:56,163
"Come on! Hold out your glass, Ernest old chap."

913
01:34:56,163 --> 01:35:00,603
Alfred raised his glass in the air and Ernest filled it with
champagne.

914
01:35:00,723 --> 01:35:14,563
"Well, here's to a successful end to the Dracula affair. The Globe has been awfully good. Of course, they didn't believe
a word of it, but they said that even as a work of fiction it was worth publishing."

915
01:35:14,563 --> 01:35:16,403
"Oh, well done, old fellow."

916
01:35:16,403 --> 01:35:26,163
"Yes, we're going to call it The Real Count Dracula, in ten
episodes. I have to admit that I'm going to make a fortune."

917
01:35:26,163 --> 01:35:38,203
"Well, I must tell you, old fellow, that you're not the only one who's had some success. I'm going to have an article
published in The British Bat Society magazine on the vampire bat and I've been booked to give talks on the subject all summer."

918
01:35:38,203 --> 01:35:44,483
"Oh, how superb! Let's drink to the late and present Counts
Dracula!"

919
01:35:44,483 --> 01:35:47,243
"I wonder what happened to the Doctor."

920
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:51,443
"Probably took one of his deadly potions. He had nothing to
live for."

921
01:35:51,443 --> 01:35:57,603
Just then, there was a knock on the door and Alfred's
servant entered with a letter.

922
01:35:57,603 --> 01:36:01,163
Alfred opened it quickly.

923
01:36:01,163 --> 01:36:07,283
"Ah, it's from Rodolfo. Let's see what he has to say.

924
01:36:07,283 --> 01:37:07,963
'Dear Alfred and Ernest, I have some good and some bad news. The bad news is that my brother Radu died and was buried
next to his father in the Dracula Cemetery. The good news is that the Doctor is dead. He was found with all the blood sucked out of him with his horrible bats standing on his body. He died as he deserved to: in the way that he killed his victims. The other good news is that I am getting married and would like you to come to my wedding. I am marrying the daughter of a Count, in Craiova. I know it may not be possible for you to come, but it would make me very happy as I owe you my life and much more.

925
01:37:07,963 --> 01:37:11,883
Your true and devoted friend,

926
01:37:11,923 --> 01:37:14,323
Count Rodolfo Dracula.

927
01:37:14,363 --> 01:37:20,123
"Well, it is nice to know that everything turned out all
right for him in the end.

928
01:37:20,163 --> 01:37:22,763
What about this wedding thing, then?"

929
01:37:22,803 --> 01:37:26,323
"Let's decide tomorrow. Have some more champagne?"

930
01:37:26,363 --> 01:37:32,763
Some minutes later, there was another knock on the door, and
Alfred's servant entered with another letter.

931
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:36,083
Alfred opened it and looked at the name.

932
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:43,443
"Frankenstein. Have you heard the name Frankenstein before?"

933
01:37:43,443 --> 01:37:48,043
"Yes, I believe I have. Wasn't he that chap who created a
monster?"

934
01:37:48,043 --> 01:38:25,403
'"Dear Alfred Sackville-Jones, something terrible has happened. There have been reports that a family of monsters
looking like the monster my grandfather created, have been seen high up in a mountain in Switzerland. I do not know whether it is a He or not. Could you please come and investigate? I have heard about your success with Count Dracula and I want you to do the same for the Frankenstein name. Please reply as soon as possible. Yours, Albert Frankenstein.'"

935
01:38:25,403 --> 01:38:30,363
"Well, it sounds pretty exciting to me. When shall we
leave?"

936
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:34,723
"Ernest, Ernest, old boy! I still haven't recovered from the
Dracula affair!"

937
01:38:34,723 --> 01:38:36,323
"Oh, what a spoil sport you are!"

938
01:38:36,323 --> 01:38:55,763
"Well, I won't say no. I'll decide tomorrow. Come on. Let's enjoy this champagne and go for a walk to the Tower Bridge.
I do love England at this time of year. Don't you?"
