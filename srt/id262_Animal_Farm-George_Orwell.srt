CHAPTER I

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had 
locked the hen-houses for the night,  

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,000
but was too drunk to remember 
to shut the pop-holes.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,120
With the ring of light from his lantern dancing 
from side to side, he lurched across the yard,  

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,360
kicked off his boots at the back door, 
drew himself a last glass of beer from  

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:33,080
the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up 
to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,480
As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there  

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,520
was a stirring and a fluttering 
all through the farm buildings.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,360
Word had gone round during the day that 
old Major, the prize Middle White boar,  

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,960
had had a strange dream on the previous night and 
wished to communicate it to the other animals.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
It had been agreed that they should all meet  

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
in the big barn as soon as Mr. 
Jones was safely out of the way.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Old Major (so he was always called,  

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,880
though the name under which he had been exhibited 
was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on  

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,160
the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an 
hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,160
At one end of the big barn, 
on a sort of raised platform,  

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Major was already ensconced on his bed of 
straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,360
He was twelve years old and 
had lately grown rather stout,  

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,480
but he was still a majestic-looking pig,  

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,360
with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite 
of the fact that his tushes had never been cut.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
Before long the other animals began to arrive  

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,600
and make themselves comfortable 
after their different fashions.

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,560
First came the three dogs, 
Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher,  

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,400
and then the pigs, who settled down in the 
straw immediately in front of the platform.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,680
The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, 
the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters,  

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
the sheep and cows lay down behind 
the pigs and began to chew the cud.

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
The two cart-horses, Boxer 
and Clover, came in together,  

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,480
walking very slowly and setting 
down their vast hairy hoofs with  

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,520
great care lest there should be some 
small animal concealed in the straw.

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,400
Clover was a stout motherly 
mare approaching middle life,  

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,320
who had never quite got her 
figure back after her fourth foal.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,160
Boxer was an enormous beast, 
nearly eighteen hands high,  

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,560
and as strong as any two 
ordinary horses put together.

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,960
A white stripe down his nose gave 
him a somewhat stupid appearance,  

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,400
and in fact he was not of first-rate 
intelligence, but he was universally  

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,720
respected for his steadiness of 
character and tremendous powers of work.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,680
After the horses came Muriel, the 
white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,160
Benjamin was the oldest animal on 
the farm, and the worst tempered.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,920
He seldom talked, and when he did, it 
was usually to make some cynical remark  

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,160
for instance, he would say that God had 
given him a tail to keep the flies off,  

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,160
but that he would sooner have 
had no tail and no flies.

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,640
Alone among the animals on 
the farm he never laughed.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
If asked why, he would say that 
he saw nothing to laugh at.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Nevertheless, without openly admitting it,  

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,600
he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them 
usually spent their Sundays together in  

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,000
the small paddock beyond the orchard, 
grazing side by side and never speaking.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,520
The two horses had just lain 
down when a brood of ducklings,  

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,960
which had lost their mother, filed into 
the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering  

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,000
from side to side to find some place 
where they would not be trodden on.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Clover made a sort of wall round 
them with her great foreleg,  

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,520
and the ducklings nestled down 
inside it and promptly fell asleep.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,600
At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, 
pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones's trap,  

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,480
came mincing daintily in, 
chewing at a lump of sugar.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
She took a place near the front 
and began flirting her white mane,  

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,320
hoping to draw attention to the 
red ribbons it was plaited with.

58
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,440
Last of all came the cat, who looked 
round, as usual, for the warmest place,  

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,160
and finally squeezed herself in between 
Boxer and Clover; there she purred  

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,080
contentedly throughout Major's speech without 
listening to a word of what he was saying.

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,320
All the animals were now present except Moses,  

62
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,720
the tame raven, who slept on 
a perch behind the back door.

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,080
When Major saw that they had all 
made themselves comfortable and  

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,920
were waiting attentively, he 
cleared his throat and began:

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,280
"Comrades, you have heard already about 
the strange dream that I had last night.

66
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,080
But I will come to the dream later.

67
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,360
I have something else to say first.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,160
I do not think, comrades, that I shall 
be with you for many months longer,  

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,160
and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass 
on to you such wisdom as I have acquired.

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,480
I have had a long life, I have had much time for 
thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think  

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,080
I may say that I understand the nature of life 
on this earth as well as any animal now living.

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,560
It is about this that I wish to speak to you.

73
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,400
"Now, comrades, what is the 
nature of this life of ours?

74
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,640
Let us face it: our lives are 
miserable, laborious, and short.

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,160
We are born, we are given just so much 
food as will keep the breath in our bodies,  

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,560
and those of us who are capable of it are 
forced to work to the last atom of our strength;  

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,920
and the very instant that our usefulness has come 
to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty.

78
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,920
No animal in England knows the meaning of 
happiness or leisure after he is a year old.

79
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,240
No animal in England is free.

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,840
The life of an animal is misery and 
slavery: that is the plain truth.

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,920
"But is this simply part of the order of nature?

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it  

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,680
cannot afford a decent life 
to those who dwell upon it?

84
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,640
No, comrades, a thousand times no!

85
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,080
The soil of England is fertile, its climate 
is good, it is capable of affording food  

86
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,720
in abundance to an enormously greater 
number of animals than now inhabit it.

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,720
This single farm of ours would support a dozen 
horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep and all  

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,240
of them living in a comfort and a dignity 
that are now almost beyond our imagining.

89
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,680
Why then do we continue in 
this miserable condition?

90
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,320
Because nearly the whole of the produce of 
our labour is stolen from us by human beings.

91
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,120
There, comrades, is the 
answer to all our problems.

92
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,440
It is summed up in a single word Man.

93
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
Man is the only real enemy we have.

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:12,040
Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause 
of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.

95
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,920
"Man is the only creature that 
consumes without producing.

96
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,480
He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs,  

97
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,560
he is too weak to pull the plough, he 
cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits.

98
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,960
Yet he is lord of all the animals.

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,760
He sets them to work, he gives back 
to them the bare minimum that will  

100
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,240
prevent them from starving, and 
the rest he keeps for himself.

101
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,440
Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it,  

102
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,520
and yet there is not one of us 
that owns more than his bare skin.

103
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,440
You cows that I see before me,  

104
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,040
how many thousands of gallons of milk 
have you given during this last year?

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,000
And what has happened to that milk which 
should have been breeding up sturdy calves?

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Every drop of it has gone down 
the throats of our enemies.

107
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,240
And you hens, how many eggs 
have you laid in this last year,  

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,320
and how many of those eggs 
ever hatched into chickens?

109
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,200
The rest have all gone to market to 
bring in money for Jones and his men.

110
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,640
And you, Clover, where are 
those four foals you bore,  

111
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,320
who should have been the support 
and pleasure of your old age?

112
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,440
Each was sold at a year old you 
will never see one of them again.

113
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,880
In return for your four confinements 
and all your labour in the fields,  

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,040
what have you ever had except 
your bare rations and a stall?

115
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,760
"And even the miserable lives we lead are 
not allowed to reach their natural span.

116
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
For myself I do not grumble, 
for I am one of the lucky ones.

117
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,600
I am twelve years old and have 
had over four hundred children.

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Such is the natural life of a pig.

119
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,720
But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end.

120
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,640
You young porkers who are sitting in front of me,  

121
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,080
every one of you will scream your 
lives out at the block within a year.

122
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:17,040
To that horror we all must come 
cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone.

123
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,880
Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate.

124
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,760
You, Boxer, the very day that those 
great muscles of yours lose their power,  

125
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,200
Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut 
your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.

126
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless,  

127
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,600
Jones ties a brick round their necks 
and drowns them in the nearest pond.

128
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
"Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades,  

129
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,000
that all the evils of this life of ours 
spring from the tyranny of human beings?

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,560
Only get rid of Man, and the produce 
of our labour would be our own.

131
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,360
Almost overnight we could become rich and free.

132
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,120
What then must we do?

133
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Why, work night and day, body and soul, 
for the overthrow of the human race!

134
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,600
That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion!

135
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,280
I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it 
might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I  

136
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:32,040
know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my 
feet, that sooner or later justice will be done.

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,880
Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout 
the short remainder of your lives!

138
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,080
And above all, pass on this message 
of mine to those who come after you,  

139
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,760
so that future generations shall carry 
on the struggle until it is victorious.

140
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,240
"And remember, comrades, your 
resolution must never falter.

141
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,280
No argument must lead you astray.

142
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,840
Never listen when they tell you that Man 
and the animals have a common interest,  

143
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,400
that the prosperity of the one 
is the prosperity of the others.

144
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,840
It is all lies.

145
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,200
Man serves the interests of 
no creature except himself.

146
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:23,400
And among us animals let there be perfect 
unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle.

147
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,200
All men are enemies.

148
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,240
All animals are comrades."

149
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,720
At this moment there was a tremendous uproar.

150
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,760
While Major was speaking four large rats had crept  

151
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,080
out of their holes and were sitting on 
their hindquarters, listening to him.

152
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,560
The dogs had suddenly caught sight of them,  

153
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,360
and it was only by a swift dash for their 
holes that the rats saved their lives.

154
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,000
Major raised his trotter for silence.

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,560
"Comrades," he said, "here is 
a point that must be settled.

156
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:03,920
The wild creatures, such as rats and 
rabbits are they our friends or our enemies?

157
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,040
Let us put it to the vote.

158
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,800
I propose this question to the 
meeting: Are rats comrades?"

159
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:18,520
The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by 
an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades.

160
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,440
There were only four dissentients, 
the three dogs and the cat,  

161
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,600
who was afterwards discovered 
to have voted on both sides.

162
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Major continued:

163
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,480
"I have little more to say.

164
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,480
I merely repeat, remember always your duty 
of enmity towards Man and all his ways.

165
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,240
Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

166
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,800
Whatever goes upon four legs, 
or has wings, is a friend.

167
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,400
And remember also that in fighting against 
Man, we must not come to resemble him.

168
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,640
Even when you have conquered 
him, do not adopt his vices.

169
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,040
No animal must ever live in a house, 
or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes,  

170
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:12,000
or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, 
or touch money, or engage in trade.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,840
All the habits of Man are evil.

172
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,480
And, above all, no animal must 
ever tyrannise over his own kind.

173
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,880
Weak or strong, clever or 
simple, we are all brothers.

174
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,680
No animal must ever kill any other animal.

175
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,720
All animals are equal.

176
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,480
"And now, comrades, I will tell 
you about my dream of last night.

177
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I cannot describe that dream to you.

178
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,520
It was a dream of the earth as 
it will be when Man has vanished.

179
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,600
But it reminded me of something 
that I had long forgotten.

180
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,240
Many years ago, when I was a 
little pig, my mother and the other  

181
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,240
sows used to sing an old song of which they 
knew only the tune and the first three words.

182
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,520
I had known that tune in my infancy, but 
it had long since passed out of my mind.

183
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Last night, however, it 
came back to me in my dream.

184
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,720
And what is more, the words of the song 
also came back-words, I am certain,  

185
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,040
which were sung by the animals of long ago 
and have been lost to memory for generations.

186
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,840
I will sing you that song now, comrades.

187
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,760
I am old and my voice is hoarse, 
but when I have taught you the tune,  

188
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,440
you can sing it better for yourselves.

189
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,600
It is called 'Beasts of England'." Old 
Major cleared his throat and began to sing.

190
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,400
As he had said, his voice was 
hoarse, but he sang well enough,  

191
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:01,560
and it was a stirring tune, something 
between 'Clementine' and 'La Cucaracha'.

192
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,000
The words ran:

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,520
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, 
Beasts of every land and clime,  

194
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,440
Hearken to my joyful tidings 
Of the golden future time.

195
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,080
Soon or late the day is coming, 
Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown,  

196
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,000
And the fruitful fields of England 
Shall be trod by beasts alone.

197
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,360
Rings shall vanish from our noses, 
And the harness from our back,  

198
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,400
Bit and spur shall rust forever, 
Cruel whips no more shall crack.

199
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,760
Riches more than mind can picture, Wheat 
and barley, oats and hay, Clover, beans,  

200
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,840
and mangel-wurzels Shall be ours upon that day.

201
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,160
Bright will shine the fields of 
England, Purer shall its waters be,  

202
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,240
Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes 
On the day that sets us free.

203
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,920
For that day we all must labour, 
Though we die before it break;  

204
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,320
Cows and horses, geese and turkeys, 
All must toil for freedom's sake.

205
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:32,400
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, 
Beasts of every land and clime,  

206
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:42,880
Hearken well and spread my tidings 
Of the golden future time.''

207
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,680
The singing of this song threw the 
animals into the wildest excitement.

208
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,480
Almost before Major had reached the end, 
they had begun singing it for themselves.

209
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,600
Even the stupidest of them had already picked up 
the tune and a few of the words, and as for the  

210
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,680
clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had 
the entire song by heart within a few minutes.

211
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,560
And then, after a few preliminary tries,  

212
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,160
the whole farm burst out into 'Beasts 
of England' in tremendous unison.

213
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,160
The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it,  

214
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,680
the sheep bleated it, the horses 
whinnied it, the ducks quacked it.

215
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,200
They were so delighted with the song that they 
sang it right through five times in succession,  

216
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,200
and might have continued singing it all 
night if they had not been interrupted.

217
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,720
Unfortunately, the uproar awoke 
Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed,  

218
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,640
making sure that there was a fox in the yard.

219
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,680
He seized the gun which always 
stood in a corner of his bedroom,  

220
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,360
and let fly a charge of number 
6 shot into the darkness.

221
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,520
The pellets buried themselves in the wall of 
the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly.

222
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,800
Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place.

223
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,360
The birds jumped on to their perches, 
the animals settled down in the straw,  

224
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,840
and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.

225
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,280
CHAPTER II

226
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,200
Three nights later old Major 
died peacefully in his sleep.

227
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,360
His body was buried at the foot of the orchard.

228
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
This was early in March.

229
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,760
During the next three months 
there was much secret activity.

230
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
Major's speech had given to 
the more intelligent animals  

231
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,560
on the farm a completely new outlook on life.

232
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,000
They did not know when the Rebellion 
predicted by Major would take place,  

233
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,920
they had no reason for thinking that 
it would be within their own lifetime,  

234
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,240
but they saw clearly that it was 
their duty to prepare for it.

235
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,280
The work of teaching and organising the 
others fell naturally upon the pigs,  

236
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,560
who were generally recognised as 
being the cleverest of the animals.

237
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,880
Preeminent among the pigs were two 
young boars named Snowball and Napoleon,  

238
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,080
whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale.

239
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,200
Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking 
Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm,  

240
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,000
not much of a talker, but with a 
reputation for getting his own way.

241
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon,  

242
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,280
quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not 
considered to have the same depth of character.

243
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,840
All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers.

244
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,960
The best known among them was 
a small fat pig named Squealer,  

245
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,720
with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, 
nimble movements, and a shrill voice.

246
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,600
He was a brilliant talker, and when he was 
arguing some difficult point he had a way  

247
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,800
of skipping from side to side and whisking 
his tail which was somehow very persuasive.

248
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,280
The others said of Squealer that 
he could turn black into white.

249
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,640
These three had elaborated old Major's 
teachings into a complete system of thought,  

250
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,160
to which they gave the name of Animalism.

251
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,080
Several nights a week, after Mr. 
Jones was asleep, they held secret  

252
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,200
meetings in the barn and expounded the 
principles of Animalism to the others.

253
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,520
At the beginning they met with 
much stupidity and apathy.

254
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,400
Some of the animals talked of 
the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones,  

255
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,920
whom they referred to as "Master," or made 
elementary remarks such as "Mr. Jones feeds us.

256
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,600
If he were gone, we should starve to death." 
Others asked such questions as "Why should we  

257
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,160
care what happens after we are dead?" or 
"If this Rebellion is to happen anyway,  

258
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,160
what difference does it make whether 
we work for it or not?", and the pigs  

259
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,960
had great difficulty in making them see that 
this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism.

260
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,320
The stupidest questions of all were 
asked by Mollie, the white mare.

261
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,720
The very first question she asked Snowball was: 
"Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?"

262
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,520
"No," said Snowball firmly.

263
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
"We have no means of making sugar on this farm.

264
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,040
Besides, you do not need sugar.

265
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,920
You will have all the oats and hay you want."

266
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,280
"And shall I still be allowed to wear 
ribbons in my mane?" asked Mollie.

267
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,520
"Comrade," said Snowball, "those ribbons that 
you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery.

268
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,200
Can you not understand that liberty 
is worth more than ribbons?"

269
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,920
Mollie agreed, but she did 
not sound very convinced.

270
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,080
The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract 
the lies put about by Moses, the tame raven.

271
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,160
Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet,  

272
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,920
was a spy and a tale-bearer, 
but he was also a clever talker.

273
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,480
He claimed to know of the existence of a 
mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain,  

274
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,520
to which all animals went when they died.

275
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,640
It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a 
little distance beyond the clouds, Moses said.

276
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,320
In Sugarcandy Mountain it 
was Sunday seven days a week,  

277
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,240
clover was in season all the year round, and 
lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges.

278
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,200
The animals hated Moses because 
he told tales and did no work,  

279
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,120
but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain,  

280
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,920
and the pigs had to argue very hard to 
persuade them that there was no such place.

281
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:19,240
Their most faithful disciples were 
the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover.

282
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,960
These two had great difficulty in 
thinking anything out for themselves,  

283
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,360
but having once accepted the pigs as their 
teachers, they absorbed everything that they  

284
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,320
were told, and passed it on to the 
other animals by simple arguments.

285
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,480
They were unfailing in their attendance 
at the secret meetings in the barn,  

286
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,840
and led the singing of 'Beasts of England', 
with which the meetings always ended.

287
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,760
Now, as it turned out, the 
Rebellion was achieved much  

288
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,440
earlier and more easily than anyone had expected.

289
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,080
In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master,  

290
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,840
had been a capable farmer, but of 
late he had fallen on evil days.

291
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,600
He had become much disheartened 
after losing money in a lawsuit,  

292
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,080
and had taken to drinking 
more than was good for him.

293
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,840
For whole days at a time he would lounge 
in his Windsor chair in the kitchen,  

294
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,840
reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally 
feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer.

295
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,560
His men were idle and dishonest, 
the fields were full of weeds,  

296
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,440
the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were 
neglected, and the animals were underfed.

297
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,360
June came and the hay was 
almost ready for cutting.

298
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,320
On Midsummer's Eve, which was a Saturday, 
Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got  

299
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,160
so drunk at the Red Lion that he did 
not come back till midday on Sunday.

300
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,880
The men had milked the cows in the early 
morning and then had gone out rabbiting,  

301
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
without bothering to feed the animals.

302
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,840
When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went 
to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the  

303
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,720
News of the World over his face, so that when 
evening came, the animals were still unfed.

304
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
At last they could stand it no longer.

305
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,160
One of the cows broke in the 
door of the store-shed with  

306
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,120
her horn and all the animals began 
to help themselves from the bins.

307
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,320
It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up.

308
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,800
The next moment he and his four men were in 
the store-shed with whips in their hands,  

309
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,160
lashing out in all directions.

310
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,200
This was more than the hungry animals could bear.

311
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,520
With one accord, though nothing of 
the kind had been planned beforehand,  

312
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,360
they flung themselves upon their tormentors.

313
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,000
Jones and his men suddenly found themselves 
being butted and kicked from all sides.

314
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
The situation was quite out of their control.

315
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
They had never seen animals 
behave like this before,  

316
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,160
and this sudden uprising of creatures whom 
they were used to thrashing and maltreating  

317
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,040
just as they chose, frightened 
them almost out of their wits.

318
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,920
After only a moment or two they gave up trying 
to defend themselves and took to their heels.

319
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,600
A minute later all five of them were 
in full flight down the cart-track  

320
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,800
that led to the main road, with the 
animals pursuing them in triumph.

321
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,440
Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom 
window, saw what was happening,  

322
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,760
hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet 
bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way.

323
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,120
Moses sprang off his perch and 
flapped after her, croaking loudly.

324
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,840
Meanwhile the animals had chased 
Jones and his men out on to the  

325
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,360
road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them.

326
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,080
And so, almost before they knew what 
was happening, the Rebellion had been  

327
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:34,880
successfully carried through: Jones was 
expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.

328
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,680
For the first few minutes the animals 
could hardly believe in their good fortune.

329
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,040
Their first act was to gallop in a body 
right round the boundaries of the farm,  

330
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,240
as though to make quite sure that no 
human being was hiding anywhere upon it;  

331
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,560
then they raced back to the farm buildings to 
wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign.

332
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,360
The harness-room at the end of the 
stables was broken open; the bits,  

333
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,840
the nose-rings, the dog-chains, 
the cruel knives with which Mr.  

334
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,360
Jones had been used to castrate the pigs 
and lambs, were all flung down the well.

335
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,040
The reins, the halters, the 
blinkers, the degrading nosebags,  

336
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,960
were thrown on to the rubbish fire 
which was burning in the yard.

337
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,280
So were the whips.

338
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,800
All the animals capered with joy when 
they saw the whips going up in flames.

339
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,520
Snowball also threw on to the fire 
the ribbons with which the horses'  

340
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,640
manes and tails had usually 
been decorated on market days.

341
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,760
"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as 
clothes, which are the mark of a human being.

342
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,320
All animals should go naked."

343
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,320
When Boxer heard this he fetched the 
small straw hat which he wore in summer  

344
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,520
to keep the flies out of his ears, and 
flung it on to the fire with the rest.

345
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,160
In a very little while the animals had destroyed 
everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones.

346
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,120
Napoleon then led them back to the 
store-shed and served out a double  

347
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,280
ration of corn to everybody, 
with two biscuits for each dog.

348
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,600
Then they sang 'Beasts of England' 
from end to end seven times running,  

349
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,520
and after that they settled down for the night 
and slept as they had never slept before.

350
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,600
But they woke at dawn as usual, and 
suddenly remembering the glorious  

351
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,880
thing that had happened, they all 
raced out into the pasture together.

352
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,880
A little way down the pasture there was a knoll 
that commanded a view of most of the farm.

353
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,160
The animals rushed to the top of it and 
gazed round them in the clear morning light.

354
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,840
Yes, it was theirs everything 
that they could see was theirs!

355
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,720
In the ecstasy of that thought 
they gambolled round and round,  

356
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,400
they hurled themselves into the 
air in great leaps of excitement.

357
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,040
They rolled in the dew, they cropped 
mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass,  

358
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,920
they kicked up clods of the black 
earth and snuffed its rich scent.

359
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,840
Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole 
farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the  

360
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,720
ploughland, the hayfield, the 
orchard, the pool, the spinney.

361
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,040
It was as though they had 
never seen these things before,  

362
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,800
and even now they could hardly 
believe that it was all their own.

363
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,040
Then they filed back to the farm buildings and  

364
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,560
halted in silence outside 
the door of the farmhouse.

365
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,080
That was theirs too, but they 
were frightened to go inside.

366
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,560
After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon 
butted the door open with their shoulders and  

367
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,680
the animals entered in single file, walking with 
the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything.

368
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,440
They tiptoed from room to room, 
afraid to speak above a whisper  

369
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,360
and gazing with a kind of awe 
at the unbelievable luxury,  

370
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,080
at the beds with their feather mattresses, 
the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa,  

371
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:01,040
the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen 
Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece.

372
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,520
They were lust coming down the stairs 
when Mollie was discovered to be missing.

373
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,680
Going back, the others found that she 
had remained behind in the best bedroom.

374
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,840
She had taken a piece of blue ribbon 
from Mrs. Jones's dressing-table, and  

375
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,880
was holding it against her shoulder and admiring 
herself in the glass in a very foolish manner.

376
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,440
The others reproached her 
sharply, and they went outside.

377
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,880
Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken 
out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the  

378
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,200
scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer's 
hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched.

379
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,280
A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that 
the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum.

380
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,880
All were agreed that no 
animal must ever live there.

381
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,360
The animals had their breakfast, and then 
Snowball and Napoleon called them together again.

382
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,440
"Comrades," said Snowball, "it is half-past 
six and we have a long day before us.

383
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,520
Today we begin the hay harvest.

384
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,800
But there is another matter 
that must be attended to first."

385
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,400
The pigs now revealed that during 
the past three months they had taught  

386
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,560
themselves to read and write from an 
old spelling book which had belonged  

387
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,160
to Mr. Jones's children and which 
had been thrown on the rubbish heap.

388
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,920
Napoleon sent for pots of black 
and white paint and led the way  

389
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,640
down to the five-barred gate 
that gave on to the main road.

390
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,800
Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best  

391
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,160
at writing) took a brush between 
the two knuckles of his trotter,  

392
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:45,600
painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of 
the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM.

393
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,360
This was to be the name of 
the farm from now onwards.

394
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,000
After this they went back to the farm 
buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon  

395
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,600
sent for a ladder which they caused to be 
set against the end wall of the big barn.

396
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,480
They explained that by their studies 
of the past three months the pigs had  

397
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,000
succeeded in reducing the principles 
of Animalism to Seven Commandments.

398
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,920
These Seven Commandments would now be 
inscribed on the wall; they would form  

399
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,920
an unalterable law by which all the animals 
on Animal Farm must live for ever after.

400
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:25,080
With some difficulty (for it is not easy for 
a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball  

401
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,560
climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a 
few rungs below him holding the paint-pot.

402
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,520
The Commandments were written on the tarred  

403
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,400
wall in great white letters that 
could be read thirty yards away.

404
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,840
They ran thus:

405
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,200
THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS

406
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,480
1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

407
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,320
2. Whatever goes upon four 
legs, or has wings, is a friend.

408
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,920
3. No animal shall wear clothes.

409
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,200
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.

410
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,920
5. No animal shall drink alcohol.

411
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,120
6. No animal shall kill any other animal.

412
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,640
7. All animals are equal.

413
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,440
It was very neatly written, and except 
that "friend" was written "freind" and one  

414
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,240
of the "S's" was the wrong way round, the 
spelling was correct all the way through.

415
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
Snowball read it aloud for 
the benefit of the others.

416
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,600
All the animals nodded in complete agreement,  

417
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,560
and the cleverer ones at once began 
to learn the Commandments by heart.

418
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,080
"Now, comrades," cried Snowball, throwing 
down the paint-brush, "to the hayfield!

419
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,280
Let us make it a point of honour to get in  

420
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,520
the harvest more quickly than 
Jones and his men could do."

421
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,640
But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed 
uneasy for some time past, set up a loud lowing.

422
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,160
They had not been milked for twenty-four 
hours, and their udders were almost bursting.

423
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,480
After a little thought, the pigs sent for 
buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully,  

424
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,680
their trotters being well adapted to this task.

425
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,080
Soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy  

426
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,120
milk at which many of the animals 
looked with considerable interest.

427
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,800
"What is going to happen to 
all that milk?" said someone.

428
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,040
"Jones used sometimes to mix some of 
it in our mash," said one of the hens.

429
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,880
"Never mind the milk, comrades!" cried Napoleon, 
placing himself in front of the buckets.

430
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,480
"That will be attended to.

431
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,840
The harvest is more important.

432
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,960
Comrade Snowball will lead the way.

433
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,000
I shall follow in a few minutes.

434
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,560
Forward, comrades!

435
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,440
The hay is waiting."

436
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,920
So the animals trooped down to 
the hayfield to begin the harvest,  

437
00:33:52,920 --> 00:34:00,829
and when they came back in the evening it 
was noticed that the milk had disappeared.

438
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:00,840
CHAPTER III

439
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,080
How they toiled and sweated to get the hay in!

440
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,920
But their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest 
was an even bigger success than they had hoped.

441
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,360
Sometimes the work was hard; the 
implements had been designed for  

442
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,200
human beings and not for animals, 
and it was a great drawback that no  

443
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,000
animal was able to use any tool that 
involved standing on his hind legs.

444
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,920
But the pigs were so clever that they could 
think of a way round every difficulty.

445
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,360
As for the horses, they knew every inch 
of the field, and in fact understood the  

446
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,080
business of mowing and raking far better 
than Jones and his men had ever done.

447
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,880
The pigs did not actually work, but 
directed and supervised the others.

448
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,400
With their superior knowledge it was natural 
that they should assume the leadership.

449
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,920
Boxer and Clover would harness themselves to 
the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins  

450
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,960
were needed in these days, of course) and tramp 
steadily round and round the field with a pig  

451
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,120
walking behind and calling out "Gee up, comrade!" 
or "Whoa back, comrade!" as the case might be.

452
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,160
And every animal down to the humblest 
worked at turning the hay and gathering it.

453
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,960
Even the ducks and hens toiled 
to and fro all day in the sun,  

454
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,680
carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks.

455
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,720
In the end they finished the 
harvest in two days' less time  

456
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,800
than it had usually taken Jones and his men.

457
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,960
Moreover, it was the biggest 
harvest that the farm had ever seen.

458
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,040
There was no wastage  

459
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,760
whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp 
eyes had gathered up the very last stalk.

460
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,320
And not an animal on the farm 
had stolen so much as a mouthful.

461
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,560
All through that summer the work 
of the farm went like clockwork.

462
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,640
The animals were happy as they had 
never conceived it possible to be.

463
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,520
Every mouthful of food was an acute positive 
pleasure, now that it was truly their own food,  

464
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,120
produced by themselves and for themselves, 
not doled out to them by a grudging master.

465
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:06,000
With the worthless parasitical human beings 
gone, there was more for everyone to eat.

466
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,640
There was more leisure too, 
inexperienced though the animals were.

467
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,480
They met with many difficulties for instance, 
later in the year, when they harvested the corn,  

468
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,240
they had to tread it out in the ancient style 
and blow away the chaff with their breath,  

469
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,760
since the farm possessed no threshing machine 
but the pigs with their cleverness and Boxer  

470
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,920
with his tremendous muscles 
always pulled them through.

471
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,200
Boxer was the admiration of everybody.

472
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,520
He had been a hard worker even in Jones's time, 
but now he seemed more like three horses than one;  

473
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,400
there were days when the entire work of the 
farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders.

474
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,640
From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, 
always at the spot where the work was hardest.

475
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,520
He had made an arrangement with one of the 
cockerels to call him in the mornings half  

476
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,920
an hour earlier than anyone else, and 
would put in some volunteer labour at  

477
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,160
whatever seemed to be most needed, 
before the regular day's work began.

478
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,920
His answer to every problem, every setback,  

479
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:14,360
was "I will work harder!" which he 
had adopted as his personal motto.

480
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,760
But everyone worked according to 
his capacity The hens and ducks,  

481
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,520
for instance, saved five bushels of corn at 
the harvest by gathering up the stray grains.

482
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his 
rations, the quarrelling and biting and  

483
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,920
jealousy which had been normal features of 
life in the old days had almost disappeared.

484
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,800
Nobody shirked or almost nobody.

485
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Mollie, it was true, was not good 
at getting up in the mornings,  

486
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,200
and had a way of leaving work early on the 
ground that there was a stone in her hoof.

487
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,440
And the behaviour of the 
cat was somewhat peculiar.

488
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,400
It was soon noticed that when there was work 
to be done the cat could never be found.

489
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,400
She would vanish for hours on end, 
and then reappear at meal-times,  

490
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,000
or in the evening after work was 
over, as though nothing had happened.

491
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,960
But she always made such excellent 
excuses, and purred so affectionately,  

492
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,200
that it was impossible not to 
believe in her good intentions.

493
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,440
Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed 
quite unchanged since the Rebellion.

494
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,920
He did his work in the same slow 
obstinate way as he had done it in  

495
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,560
Jones's time, never shirking and never 
volunteering for extra work either.

496
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,000
About the Rebellion and its results 
he would express no opinion.

497
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,920
When asked whether he was not 
happier now that Jones was gone,  

498
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,920
he would say only "Donkeys live a long time.

499
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:51,320
None of you has ever seen a dead donkey," and the 
others had to be content with this cryptic answer.

500
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,040
On Sundays there was no work.

501
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,400
Breakfast was an hour later than usual,  

502
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,440
and after breakfast there was a ceremony 
which was observed every week without fail.

503
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,040
First came the hoisting of the flag.

504
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,800
Snowball had found in the harness-room 
an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's  

505
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,800
and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white.

506
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,640
This was run up the flagstaff in the 
farmhouse garden every Sunday morning.

507
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,080
The flag was green, Snowball explained, 
to represent the green fields of England,  

508
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,080
while the hoof and horn signified 
the future Republic of the Animals  

509
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,080
which would arise when the human 
race had been finally overthrown.

510
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,080
After the hoisting of the flag 
all the animals trooped into the  

511
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,840
big barn for a general assembly 
which was known as the Meeting.

512
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,240
Here the work of the coming week was planned out 
and resolutions were put forward and debated.

513
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,680
It was always the pigs who 
put forward the resolutions.

514
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,160
The other animals understood how to vote, but 
could never think of any resolutions of their own.

515
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,800
Snowball and Napoleon were by far 
the most active in the debates.

516
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,120
But it was noticed that these 
two were never in agreement:  

517
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,680
whatever suggestion either of them made, 
the other could be counted on to oppose it.

518
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,280
Even when it was resolved a thing no 
one could object to in itself to set  

519
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,720
aside the small paddock behind the orchard as 
a home of rest for animals who were past work,  

520
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,360
there was a stormy debate over the correct 
retiring age for each class of animal.

521
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,640
The Meeting always ended with the 
singing of 'Beasts of England',  

522
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,600
and the afternoon was given up to recreation.

523
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:40,840
The pigs had set aside the harness-room 
as a headquarters for themselves.

524
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,640
Here, in the evenings, they studied 
blacksmithing, carpentering,  

525
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,600
and other necessary arts from books which 
they had brought out of the farmhouse.

526
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,040
Snowball also busied himself with organising the  

527
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,800
other animals into what he 
called Animal Committees.

528
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
He was indefatigable at this.

529
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,760
He formed the Egg Production Committee for 
the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows,  

530
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,960
the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the 
object of this was to tame the rats and rabbits),  

531
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,360
the Whiter Wool Movement for 
the sheep, and various others,  

532
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,200
besides instituting classes 
in reading and writing.

533
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,560
On the whole, these projects were a failure.

534
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,800
The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for 
instance, broke down almost immediately.

535
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,280
They continued to behave very much as before,  

536
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,680
and when treated with generosity, 
simply took advantage of it.

537
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,920
The cat joined the Re-education Committee 
and was very active in it for some days.

538
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,480
She was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking 
to some sparrows who were just out of her reach.

539
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,960
She was telling them that all animals were 
now comrades and that any sparrow who chose  

540
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,480
could come and perch on her paw; but 
the sparrows kept their distance.

541
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,240
The reading and writing classes, 
however, were a great success.

542
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,720
By the autumn almost every animal on 
the farm was literate in some degree.

543
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,640
As for the pigs, they could 
already read and write perfectly.

544
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,000
The dogs learned to read fairly well,  

545
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,040
but were not interested in reading 
anything except the Seven Commandments.

546
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,800
Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better 
than the dogs, and sometimes used to read  

547
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,360
to the others in the evenings from scraps of 
newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap.

548
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,240
Benjamin could read as well as any 
pig, but never exercised his faculty.

549
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,520
So far as he knew, he said, 
there was nothing worth reading.

550
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,680
Clover learnt the whole alphabet, 
but could not put words together.

551
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:45,320
Boxer could not get beyond the letter D. He 
would trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with  

552
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,560
his great hoof, and then would stand staring 
at the letters with his ears back, sometimes  

553
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:57,120
shaking his forelock, trying with all his might 
to remember what came next and never succeeding.

554
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:05,080
On several occasions, indeed, he did learn 
E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them,  

555
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:11,760
it was always discovered that he had forgotten A, 
B, C, and D. Finally he decided to be content with  

556
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,840
the first four letters, and used to write them 
out once or twice every day to refresh his memory.

557
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,440
Mollie refused to learn any but the 
six letters which spelt her own name.

558
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,480
She would form these very 
neatly out of pieces of twig,  

559
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,680
and would then decorate them with a flower 
or two and walk round them admiring them.

560
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,200
None of the other animals on the farm 
could get further than the letter A.

561
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,120
It was also found that the stupider 
animals, such as the sheep, hens,  

562
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,280
and ducks, were unable to learn 
the Seven Commandments by heart.

563
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,360
After much thought Snowball declared 
that the Seven Commandments could in  

564
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:57,040
effect be reduced to a single maxim, 
namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad."

565
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,280
This, he said, contained the 
essential principle of Animalism.

566
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,480
Whoever had thoroughly grasped it 
would be safe from human influences.

567
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,560
The birds at first objected, since it 
seemed to them that they also had two legs,  

568
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,960
but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.

569
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:22,640
"A bird's wing, comrades," he said, "is an 
organ of propulsion and not of manipulation.

570
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,080
It should therefore be regarded as a leg.

571
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:33,760
The distinguishing mark of man is the HAND, the 
instrument with which he does all his mischief."

572
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,440
The birds did not understand Snowball's long 
words, but they accepted his explanation,  

573
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,240
and all the humbler animals set to 
work to learn the new maxim by heart.

574
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,920
FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was 
inscribed on the end wall of the barn,  

575
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,480
above the Seven Commandments and in bigger 
letters When they had once got it by heart,  

576
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,120
the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim,  

577
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:05,720
and often as they lay in the field they would 
all start bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad!

578
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:14,440
Four legs good, two legs bad!" and keep it up 
for hours on end, never growing tired of it.

579
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,240
Napoleon took no interest 
in Snowball's committees.

580
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,240
He said that the education of the young 
was more important than anything that  

581
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,320
could be done for those who were already grown up.

582
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,880
It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had 
both whelped soon after the hay harvest,  

583
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,400
giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies.

584
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,160
As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon 
took them away from their mothers,  

585
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,200
saying that he would make himself 
responsible for their education.

586
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,840
He took them up into a loft which could only 
be reached by a ladder from the harness-room,  

587
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:51,000
and there kept them in such seclusion that the 
rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.

588
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,080
The mystery of where the milk 
went to was soon cleared up.

589
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,840
It was mixed every day into the pigs' mash.

590
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,440
The early apples were now ripening, and the 
grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls.

591
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,080
The animals had assumed as a matter of course 
that these would be shared out equally;  

592
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,240
one day, however, the order went 
forth that all the windfalls were  

593
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,400
to be collected and brought to the 
harness-room for the use of the pigs.

594
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,040
At this some of the other animals 
murmured, but it was no use.

595
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,240
All the pigs were in full agreement on 
this point, even Snowball and Napoleon.

596
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,920
Squealer was sent to make the 
necessary explanations to the others.

597
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,720
"Comrades!" he cried.

598
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,240
"You do not imagine, I hope,  

599
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,360
that we pigs are doing this in a 
spirit of selfishness and privilege?

600
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,080
Many of us actually dislike milk and apples.

601
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,120
I dislike them myself.

602
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,600
Our sole object in taking these 
things is to preserve our health.

603
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,240
Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science,  

604
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,960
comrades) contain substances absolutely 
necessary to the well-being of a pig.

605
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,600
We pigs are brainworkers.

606
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,640
The whole management and organisation 
of this farm depend on us.

607
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,360
Day and night we are watching over your welfare.

608
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,920
It is for YOUR sake that we drink 
that milk and eat those apples.

609
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,800
Do you know what would happen 
if we pigs failed in our duty?

610
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,360
Jones would come back!

611
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,920
Yes, Jones would come back!

612
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,240
Surely, comrades," cried Squealer almost 
pleadingly, skipping from side to side and  

613
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:31,920
whisking his tail, "surely there is no one 
among you who wants to see Jones come back?"

614
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,120
Now if there was one thing that the 
animals were completely certain of,  

615
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,520
it was that they did not want Jones back.

616
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,280
When it was put to them in this 
light, they had no more to say.

617
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,440
The importance of keeping the pigs 
in good health was all too obvious.

618
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,120
So it was agreed without further argument that 
the milk and the windfall apples (and also the  

619
00:47:52,120 --> 00:48:00,590
main crop of apples when they ripened) 
should be reserved for the pigs alone.

620
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:00,600
CHAPTER IV

621
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:06,920
By the late summer the news of what had happened 
on Animal Farm had spread across half the county.

622
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,960
Every day Snowball and Napoleon 
sent out flights of pigeons whose  

623
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,520
instructions were to mingle with 
the animals on neighbouring farms,  

624
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,520
tell them the story of the Rebellion, and 
teach them the tune of 'Beasts of England'.

625
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,760
Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting 
in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon,  

626
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,520
complaining to anyone who would listen of 
the monstrous injustice he had suffered in  

627
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,800
being turned out of his property by 
a pack of good-for-nothing animals.

628
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:41,000
The other farmers sympathised in principle, 
but they did not at first give him much help.

629
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,800
At heart, each of them was 
secretly wondering whether  

630
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,000
he could not somehow turn Jones's 
misfortune to his own advantage.

631
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,800
It was lucky that the owners of the two  

632
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,560
farms which adjoined Animal Farm 
were on permanently bad terms.

633
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,960
One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a 
large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much  

634
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,480
overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn 
out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition.

635
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,440
Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was 
an easy-going gentleman farmer  

636
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,120
who spent most of his time in fishing 
or hunting according to the season.

637
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,200
The other farm, which was called 
Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept.

638
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,480
Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough,  

639
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,040
shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits 
and with a name for driving hard bargains.

640
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,040
These two disliked each other so 
much that it was difficult for  

641
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,760
them to come to any agreement, even 
in defence of their own interests.

642
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,360
Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly 
frightened by the rebellion on Animal Farm,  

643
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,040
and very anxious to prevent their own 
animals from learning too much about it.

644
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,960
At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the 
idea of animals managing a farm for themselves.

645
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,000
The whole thing would be over 
in a fortnight, they said.

646
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,520
They put it about that the animals on the Manor 
Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm;  

647
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,320
they would not tolerate the name 
"Animal Farm") were perpetually  

648
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,280
fighting among themselves and were 
also rapidly starving to death.

649
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,600
When time passed and the animals had evidently not 
starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed  

650
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:22,080
their tune and began to talk of the terrible 
wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm.

651
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,160
It was given out that the animals there 
practised cannibalism, tortured one  

652
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,600
another with red-hot horseshoes, 
and had their females in common.

653
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,640
This was what came of rebelling against the 
laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said.

654
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,200
However, these stories were never fully believed.

655
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,880
Rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human 
beings had been turned out and the animals  

656
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,680
managed their own affairs, continued to 
circulate in vague and distorted forms,  

657
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,680
and throughout that year a wave of 
rebelliousness ran through the countryside.

658
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,680
Bulls which had always been 
tractable suddenly turned savage,  

659
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,200
sheep broke down hedges and devoured 
the clover, cows kicked the pail over,  

660
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,720
hunters refused their fences and shot 
their riders on to the other side.

661
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:15,400
Above all, the tune and even the words of 
'Beasts of England' were known everywhere.

662
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,160
It had spread with astonishing speed.

663
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,200
The human beings could not contain 
their rage when they heard this song,  

664
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,400
though they pretended to 
think it merely ridiculous.

665
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,720
They could not understand, they said,  

666
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,480
how even animals could bring themselves 
to sing such contemptible rubbish.

667
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,200
Any animal caught singing it was 
given a flogging on the spot.

668
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,000
And yet the song was irrepressible.

669
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,920
The blackbirds whistled it in the 
hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms,  

670
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,680
it got into the din of the smithies 
and the tune of the church bells.

671
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,840
And when the human beings listened to it,  

672
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,520
they secretly trembled, hearing in 
it a prophecy of their future doom.

673
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,120
Early in October, when the corn was cut and 
stacked and some of it was already threshed,  

674
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,160
a flight of pigeons came whirling 
through the air and alighted in  

675
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,480
the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement.

676
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,120
Jones and all his men, with half a dozen 
others from Foxwood and Pinchfield,  

677
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:19,040
had entered the five-barred gate and were 
coming up the cart-track that led to the farm.

678
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,080
They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, 
who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands.

679
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,320
Obviously they were going to 
attempt the recapture of the farm.

680
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,640
This had long been expected, and 
all preparations had been made.

681
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,080
Snowball, who had studied an old book 
of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he  

682
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,600
had found in the farmhouse, was in 
charge of the defensive operations.

683
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,720
He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple 
of minutes every animal was at his post.

684
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,040
As the human beings approached the farm 
buildings, Snowball launched his first attack.

685
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,400
All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, 
flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted  

686
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,520
upon them from mid-air; and while the 
men were dealing with this, the geese,  

687
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,360
who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out 
and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.

688
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,520
However, this was only a light skirmishing 
manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder,  

689
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,120
and the men easily drove the 
geese off with their sticks.

690
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,200
Snowball now launched his second line of attack.

691
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,520
Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, 
with Snowball at the head of them,  

692
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,800
rushed forward and prodded and 
butted the men from every side,  

693
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,440
while Benjamin turned around and 
lashed at them with his small hoofs.

694
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,120
But once again the men, with their 
sticks and their hobnailed boots,  

695
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,480
were too strong for them; and suddenly, 
at a squeal from Snowball, which was the  

696
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,120
signal for retreat, all the animals turned 
and fled through the gateway into the yard.

697
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,200
The men gave a shout of triumph.

698
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,760
They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in 
flight, and they rushed after them in disorder.

699
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,920
This was just what Snowball had intended.

700
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,800
As soon as they were well inside the yard, the 
three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the  

701
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:09,120
pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, 
suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off.

702
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,040
Snowball now gave the signal for the charge.

703
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,840
He himself dashed straight for Jones.

704
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,920
Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired.

705
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,480
The pellets scored bloody streaks along 
Snowball's back, and a sheep dropped dead.

706
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,120
Without halting for an instant, Snowball 
flung his fifteen stone against Jones's legs.

707
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,680
Jones was hurled into a pile of dung 
and his gun flew out of his hands.

708
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,720
But the most terrifying spectacle 
of all was Boxer, rearing up on  

709
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,680
his hind legs and striking out with his 
great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion.

710
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,640
His very first blow took a 
stable-lad from Foxwood on  

711
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,960
the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud.

712
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,240
At the sight, several men dropped 
their sticks and tried to run.

713
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,280
Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the  

714
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,080
animals together were chasing 
them round and round the yard.

715
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,880
They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on.

716
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,640
There was not an animal on the farm that did not 
take vengeance on them after his own fashion.

717
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,840
Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof 
onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her  

718
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,360
claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly.

719
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,040
At a moment when the opening was clear,  

720
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,160
the men were glad enough to rush out of 
the yard and make a bolt for the main road.

721
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,200
And so within five minutes of their invasion they 
were in ignominious retreat by the same way as  

722
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:28,600
they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after 
them and pecking at their calves all the way.

723
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,280
All the men were gone except one.

724
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,280
Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof  

725
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,560
at the stable-lad who lay face down 
in the mud, trying to turn him over.

726
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,520
The boy did not stir.

727
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,040
"He is dead," said Boxer sorrowfully.

728
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,880
"I had no intention of doing that.

729
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,160
I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes.

730
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,240
Who will believe that I did 
not do this on purpose?"

731
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,480
"No sentimentality, comrade!" cried Snowball 
from whose wounds the blood was still dripping.

732
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,280
"War is war.

733
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,760
The only good human being is a dead one."

734
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,800
"I have no wish to take life, not 
even human life," repeated Boxer,  

735
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,920
and his eyes were full of tears.

736
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,120
"Where is Mollie?" exclaimed somebody.

737
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,600
Mollie in fact was missing.

738
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,400
For a moment there was great alarm; it 
was feared that the men might have harmed  

739
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,880
her in some way, or even 
carried her off with them.

740
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,440
In the end, however, she was found hiding in her  

741
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,200
stall with her head buried 
among the hay in the manger.

742
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,280
She had taken to flight as 
soon as the gun went off.

743
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,840
And when the others came back from looking 
for her, it was to find that the stable-lad,  

744
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,000
who in fact was only stunned, had 
already recovered and made off.

745
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,520
The animals had now reassembled 
in the wildest excitement,  

746
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,240
each recounting his own exploits in 
the battle at the top of his voice.

747
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,320
An impromptu celebration of the 
victory was held immediately.

748
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:06,520
The flag was run up and 'Beasts of England' was 
sung a number of times, then the sheep who had  

749
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:12,760
been killed was given a solemn funeral, a 
hawthorn bush being planted on her grave.

750
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,160
At the graveside Snowball made a little speech,  

751
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,280
emphasising the need for all animals to be 
ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.

752
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,640
The animals decided unanimously 
to create a military decoration,  

753
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:33,600
"Animal Hero, First Class," which was 
conferred there and then on Snowball and Boxer.

754
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,320
It consisted of a brass medal (they were 
really some old horse-brasses which had  

755
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,520
been found in the harness-room), 
to be worn on Sundays and holidays.

756
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:51,080
There was also "Animal Hero, Second Class," which 
was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.

757
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,920
There was much discussion as to 
what the battle should be called.

758
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,160
In the end, it was named 
the Battle of the Cowshed,  

759
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,800
since that was where the ambush had been sprung.

760
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,240
Mr. Jones's gun had been found lying in the mud,  

761
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,320
and it was known that there was a 
supply of cartridges in the farmhouse.

762
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,480
It was decided to set the gun up at the foot 
of the Flagstaff, like a piece of artillery,  

763
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,920
and to fire it twice a year once on October 
the twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle  

764
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,120
of the Cowshed, and once on Midsummer 
Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.

765
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,480
CHAPTER V

766
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,240
As winter drew on, Mollie became 
more and more troublesome.

767
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,840
She was late for work every morning and excused 
herself by saying that she had overslept,  

768
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:44,280
and she complained of mysterious pains, 
although her appetite was excellent.

769
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,640
On every kind of pretext she would run 
away from work and go to the drinking pool,  

770
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,560
where she would stand foolishly gazing 
at her own reflection in the water.

771
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,040
But there were also rumours 
of something more serious.

772
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,120
One day, as Mollie strolled 
blithely into the yard,  

773
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:08,720
flirting her long tail and chewing at 
a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.

774
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:14,000
"Mollie," she said, "I have 
something very serious to say to you.

775
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,160
This morning I saw you looking over the 
hedge that divides Animal Farm from Foxwood.

776
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,080
One of Mr. Pilkington's men was 
standing on the other side of the hedge.

777
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,880
And I was a long way away, but 
I am almost certain I saw this  

778
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,280
he was talking to you and you were 
allowing him to stroke your nose.

779
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,520
What does that mean, Mollie?"

780
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,160
"He didn't! I wasn't! It 
isn't true!" cried Mollie,  

781
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,640
beginning to prance about and paw the ground.

782
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,960
"Mollie!

783
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,800
Look me in the face.

784
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:52,240
Do you give me your word of honour that 
that man was not stroking your nose?"

785
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,400
"It isn't true!" repeated Mollie, but 
she could not look Clover in the face,  

786
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,240
and the next moment she took to her 
heels and galloped away into the field.

787
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,600
A thought struck Clover.

788
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,520
Without saying anything to the others,  

789
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:12,000
she went to Mollie's stall and 
turned over the straw with her hoof.

790
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,080
Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump  

791
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:21,040
sugar and several bunches of 
ribbon of different colours.

792
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,480
Three days later Mollie disappeared.

793
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,880
For some weeks nothing was 
known of her whereabouts,  

794
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,560
then the pigeons reported that they had 
seen her on the other side of Willingdon.

795
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,720
She was between the shafts of a 
smart dogcart painted red and black,  

796
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,640
which was standing outside a public-house.

797
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:44,800
A fat red-faced man in check breeches 
and gaiters, who looked like a publican,  

798
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,280
was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar.

799
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,480
Her coat was newly clipped and she wore 
a scarlet ribbon round her forelock.

800
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,600
She appeared to be enjoying 
herself, so the pigeons said.

801
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,560
None of the animals ever mentioned Mollie again.

802
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,680
In January there came bitterly hard weather.

803
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,320
The earth was like iron, and 
nothing could be done in the fields.

804
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,800
Many meetings were held in the big barn,  

805
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,480
and the pigs occupied themselves with 
planning out the work of the coming season.

806
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,880
It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were 
manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should  

807
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:30,200
decide all questions of farm policy, though their 
decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.

808
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,880
This arrangement would have worked well enough if  

809
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,600
it had not been for the disputes 
between Snowball and Napoleon.

810
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,560
These two disagreed at every point 
where disagreement was possible.

811
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,840
If one of them suggested sowing a bigger 
acreage with barley, the other was certain  

812
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,960
to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one 
of them said that such and such a field was  

813
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,880
just right for cabbages, the other would declare 
that it was useless for anything except roots.

814
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,080
Each had his own following, and 
there were some violent debates.

815
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:08,000
At the Meetings Snowball often won over 
the majority by his brilliant speeches,  

816
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,520
but Napoleon was better at canvassing 
support for himself in between times.

817
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,640
He was especially successful with the sheep.

818
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,800
Of late the sheep had taken 
to bleating "Four legs good,  

819
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:28,520
two legs bad" both in and out of season, and 
they often interrupted the Meeting with this.

820
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,320
It was noticed that they were especially 
liable to break into "Four legs good,  

821
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:37,600
two legs bad" at crucial 
moments in Snowball's speeches.

822
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,520
Snowball had made a close study of some back 
numbers of the 'Farmer and Stockbreeder' which  

823
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:48,040
he had found in the farmhouse, and was full 
of plans for innovations and improvements.

824
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:53,160
He talked learnedly about field 
drains, silage, and basic slag,  

825
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,840
and had worked out a complicated scheme 
for all the animals to drop their dung  

826
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:03,480
directly in the fields, at a different spot 
every day, to save the labour of cartage.

827
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,640
Napoleon produced no schemes of his own,  

828
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:13,600
but said quietly that Snowball's would come 
to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time.

829
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:21,560
But of all their controversies, none was so bitter 
as the one that took place over the windmill.

830
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,880
In the long pasture, not 
far from the farm buildings,  

831
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,480
there was a small knoll which was 
the highest point on the farm.

832
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:35,160
After surveying the ground, Snowball declared 
that this was just the place for a windmill,  

833
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,600
which could be made to operate a dynamo 
and supply the farm with electrical power.

834
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:46,280
This would light the stalls and warm them in 
winter, and would also run a circular saw,  

835
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,880
a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, 
and an electric milking machine.

836
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,840
The animals had never heard of anything of this 
kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned  

837
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:01,360
one and had only the most primitive machinery), 
and they listened in astonishment while Snowball  

838
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:06,720
conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which 
would do their work for them while they grazed  

839
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:12,480
at their ease in the fields or improved 
their minds with reading and conversation.

840
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,400
Within a few weeks Snowball's plans 
for the windmill were fully worked out.

841
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,520
The mechanical details came mostly 
from three books which had belonged  

842
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:28,040
to Mr. Jones 'One Thousand Useful 
Things to Do About the House',  

843
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:34,520
'Every Man His Own Bricklayer', 
and 'Electricity for Beginners'.

844
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,680
Snowball used as his study 
a shed which had once been  

845
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,720
used for incubators and had a smooth 
wooden floor, suitable for drawing on.

846
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,960
He was closeted there for hours at a time.

847
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,920
With his books held open by a stone, and with 
a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles  

848
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,640
of his trotter, he would move rapidly 
to and fro, drawing in line after line  

849
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,440
and uttering little whimpers of excitement.

850
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:05,440
Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass 
of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than  

851
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,440
half the floor, which the other animals found 
completely unintelligible but very impressive.

852
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,000
All of them came to look at Snowball's 
drawings at least once a day.

853
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,280
Even the hens and ducks came, and were 
at pains not to tread on the chalk marks.

854
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,720
Only Napoleon held aloof.

855
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,600
He had declared himself against 
the windmill from the start.

856
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,200
One day, however, he arrived 
unexpectedly to examine the plans.

857
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:40,320
He walked heavily round the shed, looked closely 
at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them  

858
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:46,400
once or twice, then stood for a little while 
contemplating them out of the corner of his eye;  

859
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:54,040
then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over 
the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.

860
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,280
The whole farm was deeply divided 
on the subject of the windmill.

861
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,640
Snowball did not deny that to build 
it would be a difficult business.

862
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,520
Stone would have to be carried and built up 
into walls, then the sails would have to be  

863
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,880
made and after that there would 
be need for dynamos and cables.

864
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,160
(How these were to be procured,  

865
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,320
Snowball did not say.) But he maintained 
that it could all be done in a year.

866
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,040
And thereafter, he declared, so 
much labour would be saved that  

867
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,840
the animals would only need 
to work three days a week.

868
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,400
Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the 
great need of the moment was to increase food  

869
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,840
production, and that if they wasted time on 
the windmill they would all starve to death.

870
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,720
The animals formed themselves into 
two factions under the slogan,  

871
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,600
"Vote for Snowball and the three-day 
week" and "Vote for Napoleon and the  

872
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:49,480
full manger." Benjamin was the only animal 
who did not side with either faction.

873
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,440
He refused to believe either that food would  

874
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,600
become more plentiful or that 
the windmill would save work.

875
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:04,120
Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would 
go on as it had always gone on that is, badly.

876
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:09,880
Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there 
was the question of the defence of the farm.

877
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,080
It was fully realised that though the 
human beings had been defeated in the  

878
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,560
Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and  

879
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,600
more determined attempt to recapture 
the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones.

880
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,160
They had all the more reason for doing so 
because the news of their defeat had spread  

881
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,720
across the countryside and made the animals on 
the neighbouring farms more restive than ever.

882
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,000
As usual, Snowball and 
Napoleon were in disagreement.

883
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,600
According to Napoleon, what the 
animals must do was to procure  

884
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,080
firearms and train themselves in the use of them.

885
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,800
According to Snowball, they must send 
out more and more pigeons and stir up  

886
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,560
rebellion among the animals on the other farms.

887
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:52,200
The one argued that if they could not defend 
themselves they were bound to be conquered,  

888
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,640
the other argued that if rebellions happened  

889
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,600
everywhere they would have 
no need to defend themselves.

890
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,360
The animals listened first to 
Napoleon, then to Snowball,  

891
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,720
and could not make up their 
minds which was right; indeed,  

892
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:11,160
they always found themselves in agreement 
with the one who was speaking at the moment.

893
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,760
At last the day came when 
Snowball's plans were completed.

894
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,720
At the Meeting on the following Sunday 
the question of whether or not to begin  

895
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,160
work on the windmill was to be put to the vote.

896
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,560
When the animals had assembled in the big barn,  

897
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,760
Snowball stood up and, though occasionally 
interrupted by bleating from the sheep,  

898
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,440
set forth his reasons for advocating 
the building of the windmill.

899
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,520
Then Napoleon stood up to reply.

900
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,680
He said very quietly that the windmill was 
nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote  

901
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:49,680
for it, and promptly sat down again; he 
had spoken for barely thirty seconds,  

902
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,600
and seemed almost indifferent 
as to the effect he produced.

903
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,200
At this Snowball sprang to his 
feet, and shouting down the sheep,  

904
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:03,000
who had begun bleating again, broke into a 
passionate appeal in favour of the windmill.

905
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,080
Until now the animals had been about 
equally divided in their sympathies,  

906
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,760
but in a moment Snowball's 
eloquence had carried them away.

907
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,720
In glowing sentences he painted 
a picture of Animal Farm as it  

908
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,760
might be when sordid labour was 
lifted from the animals' backs.

909
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,400
His imagination had now run far beyond 
chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers.

910
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,080
Electricity, he said, could 
operate threshing machines,  

911
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,600
ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers 
and binders, besides supplying every  

912
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,480
stall with its own electric light, hot 
and cold water, and an electric heater.

913
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,160
By the time he had finished speaking, there 
was no doubt as to which way the vote would go.

914
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:47,880
But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, 
casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball,  

915
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:53,880
uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind 
no one had ever heard him utter before.

916
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,960
At this there was a terrible baying sound outside,  

917
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:03,960
and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded 
collars came bounding into the barn.

918
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,640
They dashed straight for Snowball,  

919
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,800
who only sprang from his place just 
in time to escape their snapping jaws.

920
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,120
In a moment he was out of the 
door and they were after him.

921
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,040
Too amazed and frightened to speak,  

922
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,760
all the animals crowded through 
the door to watch the chase.

923
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,480
Snowball was racing across the 
long pasture that led to the road.

924
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,440
He was running as only a pig can run, 
but the dogs were close on his heels.

925
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,360
Suddenly he slipped and it 
seemed certain that they had him.

926
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,800
Then he was up again, running faster than 
ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again.

927
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,480
One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball's 
tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in time.

928
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,360
Then he put on an extra spurt 
and, with a few inches to spare,  

929
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,200
slipped through a hole in the 
hedge and was seen no more.

930
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,240
Silent and terrified, the 
animals crept back into the barn.

931
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,360
In a moment the dogs came bounding back.

932
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,600
At first no one had been able to imagine  

933
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,080
where these creatures came from, 
but the problem was soon solved:  

934
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:06,840
they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken 
away from their mothers and reared privately.

935
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:12,800
Though not yet full-grown, they were huge 
dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves.

936
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,320
They kept close to Napoleon.

937
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,680
It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him  

938
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:24,080
in the same way as the other dogs 
had been used to do to Mr. Jones.

939
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,440
Napoleon, with the dogs following 
him, now mounted on to the raised  

940
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,000
portion of the floor where Major had 
previously stood to deliver his speech.

941
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,960
He announced that from now on the 
Sunday-morning Meetings would come to an end.

942
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,560
They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time.

943
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,320
In future all questions relating 
to the working of the farm would  

944
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,600
be settled by a special committee 
of pigs, presided over by himself.

945
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,680
These would meet in private and afterwards 
communicate their decisions to the others.

946
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,480
The animals would still assemble on 
Sunday mornings to salute the flag,  

947
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:08,240
sing 'Beasts of England', and receive their orders 
for the week; but there would be no more debates.

948
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,200
In spite of the shock that 
Snowball's expulsion had given them,  

949
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,600
the animals were dismayed by this announcement.

950
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,160
Several of them would have protested if 
they could have found the right arguments.

951
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,680
Even Boxer was vaguely troubled.

952
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,160
He set his ears back, shook 
his forelock several times,  

953
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:35,240
and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in 
the end he could not think of anything to say.

954
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,240
Some of the pigs themselves, 
however, were more articulate.

955
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,640
Four young porkers in the front row 
uttered shrill squeals of disapproval,  

956
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,840
and all four of them sprang to their 
feet and began speaking at once.

957
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,240
But suddenly the dogs sitting 
round Napoleon let out deep,  

958
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:57,400
menacing growls, and the pigs 
fell silent and sat down again.

959
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:05,040
Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous 
bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!"  

960
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,520
which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour 
and put an end to any chance of discussion.

961
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:16,320
Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm 
to explain the new arrangement to the others.

962
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,800
"Comrades," he said, "I trust that 
every animal here appreciates the  

963
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,120
sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made 
in taking this extra labour upon himself.

964
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,680
Do not imagine, comrades, 
that leadership is a pleasure!

965
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,800
On the contrary, it is a deep 
and heavy responsibility.

966
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:39,640
No one believes more firmly than Comrade 
Napoleon that all animals are equal.

967
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,960
He would be only too happy to let you 
make your decisions for yourselves.

968
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:50,280
But sometimes you might make the wrong 
decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?

969
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,200
Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, 
with his moonshine of windmills Snowball,  

970
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,600
who, as we now know, was 
no better than a criminal?"

971
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,080
"He fought bravely at the Battle 
of the Cowshed," said somebody.

972
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,000
"Bravery is not enough," said Squealer.

973
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,320
"Loyalty and obedience are more important.

974
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:13,120
And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, 
I believe the time will come when we  

975
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,880
shall find that Snowball's part 
in it was much exaggerated.

976
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,720
Discipline, comrades, iron discipline!

977
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,320
That is the watchword for today.

978
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,040
One false step, and our enemies would be upon us.

979
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,600
Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?"

980
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,040
Once again this argument was unanswerable.

981
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,840
Certainly the animals did not want Jones 
back; if the holding of debates on Sunday  

982
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,040
mornings was liable to bring him 
back, then the debates must stop.

983
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:49,760
Boxer, who had now had time to think things 
over, voiced the general feeling by saying:  

984
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:57,320
"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be 
right." And from then on he adopted the maxim,  

985
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:05,560
"Napoleon is always right," in addition to 
his private motto of "I will work harder."  

986
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,800
By this time the weather had broken 
and the spring ploughing had begun.

987
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,200
The shed where Snowball had drawn 
his plans of the windmill had been  

988
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,040
shut up and it was assumed that the 
plans had been rubbed off the floor.

989
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,920
Every Sunday morning at ten 
o'clock the animals assembled  

990
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,400
in the big barn to receive 
their orders for the week.

991
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:30,120
The skull of old Major, now clean of 
flesh, had been disinterred from the  

992
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,360
orchard and set up on a stump at the 
foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun.

993
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,320
After the hoisting of the flag, 
the animals were required to  

994
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:43,480
file past the skull in a reverent 
manner before entering the barn.

995
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,320
Nowadays they did not sit all 
together as they had done in the past.

996
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,040
Napoleon, with Squealer and 
another pig named Minimus,  

997
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:58,520
who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and 
poems, sat on the front of the raised platform,  

998
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:05,200
with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle 
round them, and the other pigs sitting behind.

999
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:10,440
The rest of the animals sat facing 
them in the main body of the barn.

1000
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:15,120
Napoleon read out the orders for 
the week in a gruff soldierly style,  

1001
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:21,520
and after a single singing of 'Beasts 
of England', all the animals dispersed.

1002
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:26,320
On the third Sunday after Snowball's 
expulsion, the animals were somewhat  

1003
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:32,280
surprised to hear Napoleon announce that 
the windmill was to be built after all.

1004
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,400
He did not give any reason for having changed 
his mind, but merely warned the animals that  

1005
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:43,680
this extra task would mean very hard work, it 
might even be necessary to reduce their rations.

1006
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,320
The plans, however, had all been 
prepared, down to the last detail.

1007
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,720
A special committee of pigs had been at 
work upon them for the past three weeks.

1008
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:59,840
The building of the windmill, with various other 
improvements, was expected to take two years.

1009
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,320
That evening Squealer explained privately to the  

1010
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:07,640
other animals that Napoleon had never 
in reality been opposed to the windmill.

1011
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:12,720
On the contrary, it was he who had advocated it 
in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball  

1012
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,760
had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had 
actually been stolen from among Napoleon's papers.

1013
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,280
The windmill was, in fact, 
Napoleon's own creation.

1014
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:28,640
Why, then, asked somebody, had 
he spoken so strongly against it?

1015
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,600
Here Squealer looked very sly.

1016
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,800
That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon's cunning.

1017
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:40,040
He had SEEMED to oppose the windmill, simply 
as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball,  

1018
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,560
who was a dangerous character and a bad influence.

1019
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,600
Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan 
could go forward without his interference.

1020
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,960
This, said Squealer, was something called tactics.

1021
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,000
He repeated a number of times,  

1022
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:01,680
"Tactics, comrades, tactics!" skipping round 
and whisking his tail with a merry laugh.

1023
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:07,160
The animals were not certain what the word 
meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively,  

1024
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:12,400
and the three dogs who happened to 
be with him growled so threateningly,  

1025
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:18,870
that they accepted his explanation 
without further questions.

1026
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
CHAPTER VI

1027
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,080
All that year the animals worked like slaves.

1028
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,800
But they were happy in their work; 
they grudged no effort or sacrifice,  

1029
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,840
well aware that everything that they did was 
for the benefit of themselves and those of  

1030
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:36,200
their kind who would come after them, and not 
for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.

1031
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,840
Throughout the spring and summer 
they worked a sixty-hour week,  

1032
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:45,200
and in August Napoleon announced that there 
would be work on Sunday afternoons as well.

1033
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,320
This work was strictly voluntary,  

1034
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:53,560
but any animal who absented himself from 
it would have his rations reduced by half.

1035
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,200
Even so, it was found necessary 
to leave certain tasks undone.

1036
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,920
The harvest was a little less 
successful than in the previous year,  

1037
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,280
and two fields which should have been 
sown with roots in the early summer  

1038
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,920
were not sown because the ploughing 
had not been completed early enough.

1039
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:15,320
It was possible to foresee that the 
coming winter would be a hard one.

1040
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,600
The windmill presented unexpected difficulties.

1041
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:24,080
There was a good quarry of limestone on the 
farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been  

1042
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:29,200
found in one of the outhouses, so that all 
the materials for building were at hand.

1043
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,160
But the problem the animals could not at  

1044
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:36,720
first solve was how to break up the 
stone into pieces of suitable size.

1045
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,120
There seemed no way of doing this 
except with picks and crowbars,  

1046
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:45,280
which no animal could use, because no 
animal could stand on his hind legs.

1047
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,560
Only after weeks of vain effort did the 
right idea occur to somebody-namely,  

1048
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,400
to utilise the force of gravity.

1049
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:59,320
Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they 
were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry.

1050
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:04,640
The animals lashed ropes round these, and 
then all together, cows, horses, sheep,  

1051
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:10,200
any animal that could lay hold of the rope even 
the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments  

1052
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,680
they dragged them with desperate slowness 
up the slope to the top of the quarry,  

1053
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:18,960
where they were toppled over the 
edge, to shatter to pieces below.

1054
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,560
Transporting the stone when it was 
once broken was comparatively simple.

1055
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,400
The horses carried it off in cart-loads, 
the sheep dragged single blocks,  

1056
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:33,880
even Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into 
an old governess-cart and did their share.

1057
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,640
By late summer a sufficient 
store of stone had accumulated,  

1058
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:42,760
and then the building began, under 
the superintendence of the pigs.

1059
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,480
But it was a slow, laborious process.

1060
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:49,640
Frequently it took a whole day of exhausting 
effort to drag a single boulder to the top  

1061
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:54,640
of the quarry, and sometimes when it was 
pushed over the edge it failed to break.

1062
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,840
Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer,  

1063
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,000
whose strength seemed equal to that of 
all the rest of the animals put together.

1064
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,280
When the boulder began to slip and 
the animals cried out in despair  

1065
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,080
at finding themselves dragged down 
the hill, it was always Boxer who  

1066
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:13,480
strained himself against the rope 
and brought the boulder to a stop.

1067
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:20,000
To see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his 
breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing  

1068
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,560
at the ground, and his great sides matted 
with sweat, filled everyone with admiration.

1069
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,440
Clover warned him sometimes to be 
careful not to overstrain himself,  

1070
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,760
but Boxer would never listen to her.

1071
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,360
His two slogans, "I will 
work harder" and "Napoleon  

1072
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,560
is always right," seemed to him a 
sufficient answer to all problems.

1073
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,800
He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call  

1074
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,400
him three-quarters of an hour earlier 
in the mornings instead of half an hour.

1075
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,720
And in his spare moments, of which there were not 
many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry,  

1076
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:00,840
collect a load of broken stone, and drag it 
down to the site of the windmill unassisted.

1077
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:07,160
The animals were not badly off throughout that 
summer, in spite of the hardness of their work.

1078
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:13,640
If they had no more food than they had had in 
Jones's day, at least they did not have less.

1079
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:18,760
The advantage of only having to feed themselves, 
and not having to support five extravagant human  

1080
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:24,560
beings as well, was so great that it would 
have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it.

1081
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:30,120
And in many ways the animal method of doing 
things was more efficient and saved labour.

1082
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:36,120
Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done 
with a thoroughness impossible to human beings.

1083
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:42,560
And again, since no animal now stole, it was 
unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land,  

1084
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,560
which saved a lot of labour on 
the upkeep of hedges and gates.

1085
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,280
Nevertheless, as the summer wore on,  

1086
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,520
various unforeseen shortages 
began to make them selves felt.

1087
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,120
There was need of paraffin oil, 
nails, string, dog biscuits,  

1088
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:03,000
and iron for the horses' shoes, none 
of which could be produced on the farm.

1089
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,360
Later there would also be need 
for seeds and artificial manures,  

1090
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,360
besides various tools and, finally, 
the machinery for the windmill.

1091
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:17,480
How these were to be procured, 
no one was able to imagine.

1092
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,800
One Sunday morning, when the animals 
assembled to receive their orders,  

1093
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,080
Napoleon announced that he 
had decided upon a new policy.

1094
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,400
From now onwards Animal Farm would engage 
in trade with the neighbouring farms:  

1095
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,960
not, of course, for any commercial purpose,  

1096
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:39,160
but simply in order to obtain certain 
materials which were urgently necessary.

1097
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,520
The needs of the windmill must 
override everything else, he said.

1098
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,400
He was therefore making arrangements 
to sell a stack of hay and part of  

1099
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:51,880
the current year's wheat crop, and 
later on, if more money were needed,  

1100
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:56,960
it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, 
for which there was always a market in Willingdon.

1101
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,720
The hens, said Napoleon, should 
welcome this sacrifice as their  

1102
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:05,480
own special contribution towards 
the building of the windmill.

1103
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:10,480
Once again the animals were 
conscious of a vague uneasiness.

1104
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:16,040
Never to have any dealings with human 
beings, never to engage in trade,  

1105
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:21,280
never to make use of money had not these 
been among the earliest resolutions  

1106
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:26,600
passed at that first triumphant 
Meeting after Jones was expelled?

1107
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,800
All the animals remembered 
passing such resolutions:  

1108
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,920
or at least they thought that they remembered it.

1109
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:37,600
The four young pigs who had protested when 
Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised  

1110
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:43,720
their voices timidly, but they were promptly 
silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs.

1111
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:48,040
Then, as usual, the sheep 
broke into "Four legs good,  

1112
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:54,000
two legs bad!" and the momentary 
awkwardness was smoothed over.

1113
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,960
Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for  

1114
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:00,520
silence and announced that he had 
already made all the arrangements.

1115
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,760
There would be no need for any of the 
animals to come in contact with human  

1116
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,280
beings, which would clearly be most undesirable.

1117
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,680
He intended to take the whole 
burden upon his own shoulders.

1118
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,120
A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon,  

1119
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:18,720
had agreed to act as intermediary between 
Animal Farm and the outside world,  

1120
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,800
and would visit the farm every Monday 
morning to receive his instructions.

1121
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,360
Napoleon ended his speech with his 
usual cry of "Long live Animal Farm!"  

1122
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:33,880
and after the singing of 'Beasts of 
England' the animals were dismissed.

1123
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,040
Afterwards Squealer made a round of the 
farm and set the animals' minds at rest.

1124
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,240
He assured them that the resolution 
against engaging in trade and using  

1125
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,960
money had never been passed, or even suggested.

1126
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:52,480
It was pure imagination, probably traceable in 
the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball.

1127
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:58,320
A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, 
but Squealer asked them shrewdly, "Are you  

1128
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,040
certain that this is not something 
that you have dreamed, comrades?

1129
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,160
Have you any record of such a resolution?

1130
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:09,320
Is it written down anywhere?" And since it 
was certainly true that nothing of the kind  

1131
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,840
existed in writing, the animals were 
satisfied that they had been mistaken.

1132
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,480
Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited 
the farm as had been arranged.

1133
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,360
He was a sly-looking little man with side 
whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of  

1134
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,960
business, but sharp enough to have 
realised earlier than anyone else  

1135
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:33,280
that Animal Farm would need a broker and 
that the commissions would be worth having.

1136
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,600
The animals watched his coming 
and going with a kind of dread,  

1137
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,240
and avoided him as much as possible.

1138
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,800
Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on 
all fours, delivering orders to Whymper,  

1139
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:51,080
who stood on two legs, roused their pride and 
partly reconciled them to the new arrangement.

1140
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:56,480
Their relations with the human race were now 
not quite the same as they had been before.

1141
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,200
The human beings did not hate Animal 
Farm any less now that it was prospering;  

1142
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,920
indeed, they hated it more than ever.

1143
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:09,200
Every human being held it as an article of faith 
that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later,  

1144
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,600
and, above all, that the 
windmill would be a failure.

1145
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:17,120
They would meet in the public-houses and prove 
to one another by means of diagrams that the  

1146
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:23,320
windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it 
did stand up, then that it would never work.

1147
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,040
And yet, against their will, they had 
developed a certain respect for the  

1148
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,800
efficiency with which the animals 
were managing their own affairs.

1149
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,640
One symptom of this was that they 
had begun to call Animal Farm by its  

1150
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:39,840
proper name and ceased to pretend 
that it was called the Manor Farm.

1151
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,960
They had also dropped their championship of Jones,  

1152
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:48,280
who had given up hope of getting his farm back 
and gone to live in another part of the county.

1153
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,760
Except through Whymper, there was as yet no 
contact between Animal Farm and the outside  

1154
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:57,160
world, but there were constant rumours 
that Napoleon was about to enter into a  

1155
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:02,240
definite business agreement either with 
Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr.  

1156
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:09,240
Frederick of Pinchfield but never, it 
was noticed, with both simultaneously.

1157
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:13,000
It was about this time that 
the pigs suddenly moved into  

1158
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,960
the farmhouse and took up their residence there.

1159
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:22,160
Again the animals seemed to remember that a 
resolution against this had been passed in  

1160
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:28,320
the early days, and again Squealer was able 
to convince them that this was not the case.

1161
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,640
It was absolutely necessary, he said, that 
the pigs, who were the brains of the farm,  

1162
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,560
should have a quiet place to work in.

1163
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,720
It was also more suited to the dignity of the 
Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking  

1164
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:47,320
of Napoleon under the title of "Leader") 
to live in a house than in a mere sty.

1165
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:51,400
Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed 
when they heard that the pigs not only took their  

1166
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:58,720
meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room 
as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds.

1167
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:04,920
Boxer passed it off as usual with 
"Napoleon is always right!", but Clover,  

1168
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,600
who thought she remembered a definite 
ruling against beds, went to the end of  

1169
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,080
the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven 
Commandments which were inscribed there.

1170
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:20,560
Finding herself unable to read more than 
individual letters, she fetched Muriel.

1171
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,040
"Muriel," she said, "read 
me the Fourth Commandment.

1172
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:29,200
Does it not say something 
about never sleeping in a bed?"

1173
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,640
With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.

1174
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:40,400
"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a 
bed with sheets,"' she announced finally.

1175
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:45,720
Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered 
that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets;  

1176
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:49,560
but as it was there on the 
wall, it must have done so.

1177
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,320
And Squealer, who happened to be passing at 
this moment, attended by two or three dogs,  

1178
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,960
was able to put the whole matter 
in its proper perspective.

1179
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:03,000
"You have heard then, comrades," he said, "that 
we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse?

1180
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,520
And why not?

1181
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:08,800
You did not suppose, surely, that 
there was ever a ruling against beds?

1182
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,680
A bed merely means a place to sleep in.

1183
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:15,680
A pile of straw in a stall 
is a bed, properly regarded.

1184
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,320
The rule was against sheets, 
which are a human invention.

1185
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,960
We have removed the sheets from the 
farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets.

1186
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,920
And very comfortable beds they are too!

1187
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,000
But not more comfortable than we 
need, I can tell you, comrades,  

1188
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,600
with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays.

1189
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,600
You would not rob us of our 
repose, would you, comrades?

1190
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,000
You would not have us too 
tired to carry out our duties?

1191
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,440
Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?"

1192
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,200
The animals reassured him 
on this point immediately,  

1193
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:51,560
and no more was said about the pigs 
sleeping in the farmhouse beds.

1194
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:56,040
And when, some days afterwards, it was announced 
that from now on the pigs would get up an hour  

1195
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:02,080
later in the mornings than the other animals, 
no complaint was made about that either.

1196
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,920
By the autumn the animals were tired but happy.

1197
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,800
They had had a hard year, and after the sale 
of part of the hay and corn, the stores of  

1198
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:17,640
food for the winter were none too plentiful, 
but the windmill compensated for everything.

1199
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,080
It was almost half built now.

1200
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,080
After the harvest there was a 
stretch of clear dry weather,  

1201
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:27,920
and the animals toiled harder than ever, 
thinking it well worth while to plod to and  

1202
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:34,480
fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing 
so they could raise the walls another foot.

1203
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,680
Boxer would even come out at nights and work for  

1204
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,480
an hour or two on his own by 
the light of the harvest moon.

1205
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:46,240
In their spare moments the animals would 
walk round and round the half-finished mill,  

1206
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:51,360
admiring the strength and perpendicularity 
of its walls and marvelling that they should  

1207
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,840
ever have been able to build anything so imposing.

1208
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,400
Only old Benjamin refused to grow 
enthusiastic about the windmill,  

1209
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:06,120
though, as usual, he would utter nothing beyond 
the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.

1210
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,000
November came, with raging south-west winds.

1211
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,040
Building had to stop because it 
was now too wet to mix the cement.

1212
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:18,120
Finally there came a night when the gale was 
so violent that the farm buildings rocked on  

1213
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:22,360
their foundations and several tiles 
were blown off the roof of the barn.

1214
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,720
The hens woke up squawking with terror because  

1215
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:29,280
they had all dreamed simultaneously of 
hearing a gun go off in the distance.

1216
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,440
In the morning the animals came out of their 
stalls to find that the flagstaff had been  

1217
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:38,760
blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the 
orchard had been plucked up like a radish.

1218
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:44,840
They had just noticed this when a cry of 
despair broke from every animal's throat.

1219
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,480
A terrible sight had met their eyes.

1220
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,200
The windmill was in ruins.

1221
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,000
With one accord they dashed down to the spot.

1222
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,960
Napoleon, who seldom moved out of 
a walk, raced ahead of them all.

1223
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:05,120
Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their 
struggles, levelled to its foundations,  

1224
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:10,440
the stones they had broken and carried 
so laboriously scattered all around.

1225
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:16,680
Unable at first to speak, they stood gazing 
mournfully at the litter of fallen stone.

1226
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:22,520
Napoleon paced to and fro in silence, 
occasionally snuffing at the ground.

1227
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,040
His tail had grown rigid  

1228
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:30,680
and twitched sharply from side to side, 
a sign in him of intense mental activity.

1229
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:36,200
Suddenly he halted as though 
his mind were made up.

1230
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:44,000
"Comrades," he said quietly, "do you 
know who is responsible for this?

1231
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:51,680
Do you know the enemy who has come in 
the night and overthrown our windmill?

1232
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:56,880
SNOWBALL!" he suddenly 
roared in a voice of thunder.

1233
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,320
"Snowball has done this thing!

1234
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:05,880
In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans 
and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion,  

1235
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:12,760
this traitor has crept here under cover of 
night and destroyed our work of nearly a year.

1236
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:19,120
Comrades, here and now I pronounce 
the death sentence upon Snowball.

1237
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,560
'Animal Hero, Second Class,' and half a bushel of 
apples to any animal who brings him to justice.

1238
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:30,400
A full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!"

1239
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,800
The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn  

1240
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,520
that even Snowball could be 
guilty of such an action.

1241
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:40,120
There was a cry of indignation, and 
everyone began thinking out ways of  

1242
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:43,560
catching Snowball if he should ever come back.

1243
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,200
Almost immediately the footprints of a pig  

1244
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:50,200
were discovered in the grass at 
a little distance from the knoll.

1245
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:56,160
They could only be traced for a few yards, 
but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge.

1246
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:01,520
Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and 
pronounced them to be Snowball's. He gave  

1247
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:07,400
it as his opinion that Snowball had probably 
come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.

1248
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:12,320
"No more delays, comrades!" cried Napoleon 
when the footprints had been examined.

1249
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,360
"There is work to be done.

1250
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:17,600
This very morning we begin 
rebuilding the windmill,  

1251
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,080
and we will build all through 
the winter, rain or shine.

1252
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:27,640
We will teach this miserable traitor 
that he cannot undo our work so easily.

1253
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:34,840
Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in 
our plans: they shall be carried out to the day.

1254
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,680
Forward, comrades!

1255
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,840
Long live the windmill!

1256
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:44,109
Long live Animal Farm!"

1257
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:44,120
CHAPTER VII

1258
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,560
It was a bitter winter.

1259
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,960
The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow,  

1260
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:53,640
and then by a hard frost which did 
not break till well into February.

1261
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:58,160
The animals carried on as best they could 
with the rebuilding of the windmill,  

1262
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:02,040
well knowing that the outside world was 
watching them and that the envious human  

1263
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:07,400
beings would rejoice and triumph if 
the mill were not finished on time.

1264
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,000
Out of spite, the human beings pretended 
not to believe that it was Snowball who had  

1265
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,040
destroyer the windmill: they said that it had 
fallen down because the walls were too thin.

1266
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,800
The animals knew that this was not the case.

1267
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,760
Still, it had been decided to build the 
walls three feet thick this time instead  

1268
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:30,880
of eighteen inches as before, which meant 
collecting much larger quantities of stone.

1269
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:35,720
For a long time the quarry was full of 
snowdrifts and nothing could be done.

1270
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,120
Some progress was made in the 
dry frosty weather that followed,  

1271
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:45,640
but it was cruel work, and the animals could not 
feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before.

1272
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:49,880
They were always cold, and usually hungry as well.

1273
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,600
Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart.

1274
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,840
Squealer made excellent speeches on the 
joy of service and the dignity of labour,  

1275
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,200
but the other animals found more 
inspiration in Boxer's strength and  

1276
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:11,240
his never-failing cry of "I will work 
harder!" In January food fell short.

1277
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,960
The corn ration was drastically reduced,  

1278
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:18,720
and it was announced that an extra potato 
ration would be issued to make up for it.

1279
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:23,320
Then it was discovered that the greater part of 
the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps,  

1280
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,880
which had not been covered thickly enough.

1281
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:30,760
The potatoes had become soft and 
discoloured, and only a few were edible.

1282
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:36,120
For days at a time the animals had 
nothing to eat but chaff and mangels.

1283
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,880
Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.

1284
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:44,360
It was vitally necessary to conceal 
this fact from the outside world.

1285
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,560
Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill,  

1286
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,760
the human beings were inventing 
fresh lies about Animal Farm.

1287
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:55,680
Once again it was being put about that all the 
animals were dying of famine and disease, and that  

1288
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,600
they were continually fighting among themselves 
and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide.

1289
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,160
Napoleon was well aware of the bad results 
that might follow if the real facts of the food  

1290
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:13,080
situation were known, and he decided to make use 
of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary impression.

1291
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:18,120
Hitherto the animals had had little or no 
contact with Whymper on his weekly visits:  

1292
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:23,560
now, however, a few selected animals, 
mostly sheep, were instructed to remark  

1293
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,640
casually in his hearing that 
rations had been increased.

1294
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:32,360
In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty 
bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to  

1295
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:38,240
the brim with sand, which was then covered 
up with what remained of the grain and meal.

1296
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,080
On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through  

1297
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,920
the store-shed and allowed to 
catch a glimpse of the bins.

1298
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,680
He was deceived, and continued 
to report to the outside world  

1299
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:53,440
that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.

1300
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:57,200
Nevertheless, towards the end of 
January it became obvious that  

1301
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:01,520
it would be necessary to procure 
some more grain from somewhere.

1302
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,560
In these days Napoleon rarely appeared in public,  

1303
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:11,480
but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which 
was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs.

1304
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:15,160
When he did emerge, it was in a 
ceremonial manner, with an escort  

1305
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:21,080
of six dogs who closely surrounded him 
and growled if anyone came too near.

1306
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:24,200
Frequently he did not even 
appear on Sunday mornings,  

1307
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:29,400
but issued his orders through one 
of the other pigs, usually Squealer.

1308
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,880
One Sunday morning Squealer 
announced that the hens,  

1309
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,280
who had just come in to lay 
again, must surrender their eggs.

1310
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:42,320
Napoleon had accepted, through Whymper, 
a contract for four hundred eggs a week.

1311
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,720
The price of these would pay for enough 
grain and meal to keep the farm going  

1312
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:49,240
till summer came on and conditions were easier.

1313
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:53,440
When the hens heard this, 
they raised a terrible outcry.

1314
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:57,040
They had been warned earlier that 
this sacrifice might be necessary,  

1315
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,520
but had not believed that it would really happen.

1316
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,320
They were just getting their clutches 
ready for the spring sitting,  

1317
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:06,000
and they protested that to take 
the eggs away now was murder.

1318
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,160
For the first time since the expulsion of Jones, 
there was something resembling a rebellion.

1319
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,840
Led by three young Black Minorca pullets,  

1320
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:18,720
the hens made a determined effort 
to thwart Napoleon's wishes.

1321
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:22,440
Their method was to fly up to the 
rafters and there lay their eggs,  

1322
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,160
which smashed to pieces on the floor.

1323
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:28,600
Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly.

1324
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,840
He ordered the hens' rations to be 
stopped, and decreed that any animal  

1325
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:36,640
giving so much as a grain of corn to 
a hen should be punished by death.

1326
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:40,080
The dogs saw to it that these 
orders were carried out.

1327
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:47,080
For five days the hens held out, then they 
capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes.

1328
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:50,520
Nine hens had died in the meantime.

1329
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:56,880
Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it 
was given out that they had died of coccidiosis.

1330
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,000
Whymper heard nothing of this affair, 
and the eggs were duly delivered,  

1331
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,960
a grocer's van driving up to the 
farm once a week to take them away.

1332
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,960
All this while no more had been seen of Snowball.

1333
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:16,080
He was rumoured to be hiding on one of the 
neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or Pinchfield.

1334
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:21,560
Napoleon was by this time on slightly better 
terms with the other farmers than before.

1335
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:25,360
It happened that there was in the yard 
a pile of timber which had been stacked  

1336
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:29,440
there ten years earlier when 
a beech spinney was cleared.

1337
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:33,760
It was well seasoned, and Whymper 
had advised Napoleon to sell it;  

1338
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:38,200
both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. 
Frederick were anxious to buy it.

1339
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:43,280
Napoleon was hesitating between the 
two, unable to make up his mind.

1340
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,920
It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the 
point of coming to an agreement with Frederick,  

1341
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:53,240
Snowball was declared to be in hiding at Foxwood, 
while, when he inclined toward Pilkington,  

1342
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,560
Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.

1343
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:02,280
Suddenly, early in the spring, 
an alarming thing was discovered.

1344
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:06,640
Snowball was secretly 
frequenting the farm by night!

1345
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,760
The animals were so disturbed that they 
could hardly sleep in their stalls.

1346
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:14,120
Every night, it was said, he 
came creeping in under cover  

1347
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,800
of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief.

1348
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,040
He stole the corn, he upset the 
milk-pails, he broke the eggs,  

1349
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:26,720
he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed 
the bark off the fruit trees.

1350
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:31,400
Whenever anything went wrong it became 
usual to attribute it to Snowball.

1351
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:36,160
If a window was broken or a drain was blocked 
up, someone was certain to say that Snowball  

1352
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,560
had come in the night and done it, and 
when the key of the store-shed was lost,  

1353
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,920
the whole farm was convinced that 
Snowball had thrown it down the well.

1354
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,560
Curiously enough, they went 
on believing this even after  

1355
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:51,200
the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal.

1356
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:56,720
The cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept 
into their stalls and milked them in their sleep.

1357
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:03,160
The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, 
were also said to be in league with Snowball.

1358
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:08,320
Napoleon decreed that there should be a full 
investigation into Snowball's activities.

1359
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,440
With his dogs in attendance he set out 
and made a careful tour of inspection of  

1360
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:17,440
the farm buildings, the other animals 
following at a respectful distance.

1361
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:23,520
At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed 
the ground for traces of Snowball's footsteps,  

1362
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,800
which, he said, he could detect by the smell.

1363
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,360
He snuffed in every corner, in the 
barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses,  

1364
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:36,480
in the vegetable garden, and found 
traces of Snowball almost everywhere.

1365
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,600
He would put his snout to the 
ground, give several deep sniffs,  

1366
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:45,960
ad exclaim in a terrible voice, "Snowball!

1367
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,760
He has been here!

1368
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:53,280
I can smell him distinctly!" and 
at the word "Snowball" all the dogs  

1369
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,120
let out blood-curdling growls 
and showed their side teeth.

1370
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,600
The animals were thoroughly frightened.

1371
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:04,800
It seemed to them as though Snowball 
were some kind of invisible influence,  

1372
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:09,920
pervading the air about them and 
menacing them with all kinds of dangers.

1373
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,360
In the evening Squealer called them together,  

1374
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:18,040
and with an alarmed expression on his face told 
them that he had some serious news to report.

1375
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:24,040
"Comrades!" cried Squealer, making little nervous 
skips, "a most terrible thing has been discovered.

1376
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,520
Snowball has sold himself to 
Frederick of Pinchfield Farm,  

1377
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,560
who is even now plotting to attack 
us and take our farm away from us!

1378
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,960
Snowball is to act as his 
guide when the attack begins.

1379
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,000
But there is worse than that.

1380
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,600
We had thought that Snowball's rebellion was 
caused simply by his vanity and ambition.

1381
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,440
But we were wrong, comrades.

1382
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:47,960
Do you know what the real reason 
was? Snowball was in league with  

1383
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:53,040
Jones from the very start! He was 
Jones's secret agent all the time.

1384
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:59,840
It has all been proved by documents which he left 
behind him and which we have only just discovered.

1385
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,040
To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades.

1386
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:07,240
Did we not see for ourselves how he 
attempted fortunately without success  

1387
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:11,440
to get us defeated and destroyed 
at the Battle of the Cowshed?"

1388
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,720
The animals were stupefied.

1389
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:18,240
This was a wickedness far outdoing 
Snowball's destruction of the windmill.

1390
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,600
But it was some minutes before 
they could fully take it in.

1391
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:27,160
They all remembered, or thought they remembered, 
how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them  

1392
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:31,920
at the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had 
rallied and encouraged them at every turn,  

1393
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:37,840
and how he had not paused for an instant even when 
the pellets from Jones's gun had wounded his back.

1394
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:43,480
At first it was a little difficult to see how 
this fitted in with his being on Jones's side.

1395
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:47,280
Even Boxer, who seldom asked 
questions, was puzzled.

1396
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,240
He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him,  

1397
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:56,840
shut his eyes, and with a hard effort 
managed to formulate his thoughts.

1398
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,960
"I do not believe that," he said.

1399
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:03,520
"Snowball fought bravely at 
the Battle of the Cowshed.

1400
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,800
I saw him myself.

1401
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:10,720
Did we not give him 'Animal Hero, 
first Class,' immediately afterwards?"

1402
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,480
"That was our mistake, comrade.

1403
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,880
For we know now it is all written 
down in the secret documents that  

1404
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:21,240
we have found that in reality he 
was trying to lure us to our doom."

1405
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,480
"But he was wounded," said Boxer.

1406
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,480
"We all saw him running with blood."

1407
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:30,520
"That was part of the 
arrangement!" cried Squealer.

1408
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,720
"Jones's shot only grazed him.

1409
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,280
I could show you this in his own 
writing, if you were able to read it.

1410
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,760
The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment,  

1411
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,680
to give the signal for flight 
and leave the field to the enemy.

1412
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:44,120
And he very nearly succeeded 
I will even say, comrades,  

1413
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:49,160
he WOULD have succeeded if it had not been 
for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.

1414
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:53,800
Do you not remember how, just at the moment 
when Jones and his men had got inside the yard,  

1415
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:58,760
Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many 
animals followed him? And do you not remember,  

1416
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:03,320
too, that it was just at that moment, when 
panic was spreading and all seemed lost,  

1417
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:09,680
that Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a cry 
of 'Death to Humanity!' and sank his teeth in  

1418
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:17,320
Jones's leg? Surely you remember THAT, comrades?" 
exclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to side.

1419
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:21,640
Now when Squealer described 
the scene so graphically,  

1420
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,240
it seemed to the animals 
that they did remember it.

1421
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:31,000
At any rate, they remembered that at the critical 
moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee.

1422
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,880
But Boxer was still a little uneasy.

1423
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:40,880
"I do not believe that Snowball was a 
traitor at the beginning," he said finally.

1424
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,000
"What he has done since is different.

1425
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,240
But I believe that at the Battle of 
the Cowshed he was a good comrade."

1426
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:57,120
"Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," announced 
Squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly,  

1427
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:03,880
"has stated categorically categorically, 
comrade that Snowball was Jones's agent  

1428
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:09,400
from the very beginning yes, and from long 
before the Rebellion was ever thought of."

1429
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,400
"Ah, that is different!" said Boxer.

1430
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:18,800
"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."

1431
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,040
"That is the true spirit, comrade!" 
cried Squealer, but it was noticed  

1432
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:27,120
he cast a very ugly look at Boxer 
with his little twinkling eyes.

1433
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:30,760
He turned to go, then paused 
and added impressively:  

1434
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:35,840
"I warn every animal on this farm 
to keep his eyes very wide open.

1435
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,760
For we have reason to think that 
some of Snowball's secret agents  

1436
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,200
are lurking among us at this moment!"

1437
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:50,440
Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon 
ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard.

1438
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:54,040
When they were all gathered together, 
Napoleon emerged from the farmhouse,  

1439
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:59,440
wearing both his medals (for he had recently 
awarded himself "Animal Hero, First Class",  

1440
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:03,800
and "Animal Hero, Second Class"), 
with his nine huge dogs frisking  

1441
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:09,000
round him and uttering growls that sent 
shivers down all the animals' spines.

1442
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,840
They all cowered silently in their places,  

1443
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:17,280
seeming to know in advance that some 
terrible thing was about to happen.

1444
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:22,720
Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; 
then he uttered a high-pitched whimper.

1445
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:28,960
Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized 
four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them,  

1446
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,520
squealing with pain and 
terror, to Napoleon's feet.

1447
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,560
The pigs' ears were bleeding, 
the dogs had tasted blood,  

1448
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,440
and for a few moments they 
appeared to go quite mad.

1449
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:43,000
To the amazement of everybody, three 
of them flung themselves upon Boxer.

1450
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,520
Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof,  

1451
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,360
caught a dog in mid-air, and 
pinned him to the ground.

1452
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:53,040
The dog shrieked for mercy and the other two 
fled with their tails between their legs.

1453
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:58,720
Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he 
should crush the dog to death or let it go.

1454
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:04,080
Napoleon appeared to change countenance, 
and sharply ordered Boxer to let the dog go,  

1455
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:10,320
whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the 
dog slunk away, bruised and howling.

1456
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:13,000
Presently the tumult died down.

1457
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,920
The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt 
written on every line of their countenances.

1458
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:22,640
Napoleon now called upon 
them to confess their crimes.

1459
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:28,920
They were the same four pigs as had protested 
when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings.

1460
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:33,120
Without any further prompting they confessed 
that they had been secretly in touch with  

1461
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:39,280
Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had 
collaborated with him in destroying the windmill,  

1462
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:44,800
and that they had entered into an agreement with 
him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick.

1463
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,360
They added that Snowball had privately admitted to  

1464
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:52,120
them that he had been Jones's 
secret agent for years past.

1465
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:56,760
When they had finished their confession, 
the dogs promptly tore their throats out,  

1466
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:02,880
and in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded 
whether any other animal had anything to confess.

1467
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,200
The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the  

1468
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:09,360
attempted rebellion over the eggs 
now came forward and stated that  

1469
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:15,920
Snowball had appeared to them in a dream and 
incited them to disobey Napoleon's orders.

1470
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,520
They, too, were slaughtered.

1471
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,280
Then a goose came forward and 
confessed to having secreted six  

1472
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:27,480
ears of corn during the last year's 
harvest and eaten them in the night.

1473
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:32,320
Then a sheep confessed to having urinated 
in the drinking pool urged to do this,  

1474
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:37,440
so she said, by Snowball and two other sheep 
confessed to having murdered an old ram,  

1475
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,800
an especially devoted follower of Napoleon,  

1476
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:44,520
by chasing him round and round a bonfire 
when he was suffering from a cough.

1477
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:48,040
They were all slain on the spot.

1478
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:52,880
And so the tale of confessions and 
executions went on, until there was  

1479
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:59,400
a pile of corpses lying before Napoleon's feet 
and the air was heavy with the smell of blood,  

1480
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:05,920
which had been unknown there 
since the expulsion of Jones.

1481
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,760
When it was all over, the remaining animals,  

1482
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:13,000
except for the pigs and 
dogs, crept away in a body.

1483
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,840
They were shaken and miserable.

1484
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,880
They did not know which was more shocking 
the treachery of the animals who had leagued  

1485
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:26,160
themselves with Snowball, or the cruel 
retribution they had just witnessed.

1486
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:31,080
In the old days there had often been 
scenes of bloodshed equally terrible,  

1487
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:37,200
but it seemed to all of them that it was far 
worse now that it was happening among themselves.

1488
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:43,360
Since Jones had left the farm, until 
today, no animal had killed another animal.

1489
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,880
Not even a rat had been killed.

1490
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,800
They had made their way on to the little 
knoll where the half-finished windmill stood,  

1491
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:59,280
and with one accord they all lay down as though 
huddling together for warmth Clover, Muriel,  

1492
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:06,760
Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole 
flock of geese and hens everyone, indeed,  

1493
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:13,000
except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just 
before Napoleon ordered the animals to assemble.

1494
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,800
For some time nobody spoke.

1495
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:18,640
Only Boxer remained on his feet.

1496
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:24,160
He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his 
long black tail against his sides and  

1497
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:28,160
occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise.

1498
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,600
Finally he said:

1499
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,680
"I do not understand it.

1500
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:38,640
I would not have believed that such 
things could happen on our farm.

1501
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:42,520
It must be due to some fault in ourselves.

1502
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:47,280
The solution, as I see it, is to work harder.

1503
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:52,440
From now onwards I shall get up a 
full hour earlier in the mornings."

1504
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,400
And he moved off at his lumbering 
trot and made for the quarry.

1505
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,440
Having got there, he collected 
two successive loads of stone and  

1506
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:07,240
dragged them down to the windmill 
before retiring for the night.

1507
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:11,760
The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking.

1508
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,240
The knoll where they were lying gave them 
a wide prospect across the countryside.

1509
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:21,880
Most of Animal Farm was within their view the 
long pasture stretching down to the main road,  

1510
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:27,640
the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the 
ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick  

1511
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:33,640
and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings 
with the smoke curling from the chimneys.

1512
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:36,000
It was a clear spring evening.

1513
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,680
The grass and the bursting hedges were 
gilded by the level rays of the sun.

1514
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:45,360
Never had the farm and with a kind of surprise 
they remembered that it was their own farm,  

1515
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:51,760
every inch of it their own property appeared 
to the animals so desirable a place.

1516
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:56,840
As Clover looked down the hillside 
her eyes filled with tears.

1517
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:02,040
If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would 
have been to say that this was not what they  

1518
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:08,600
had aimed at when they had set themselves years 
ago to work for the overthrow of the human race.

1519
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:13,440
These scenes of terror and slaughter 
were not what they had looked forward  

1520
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:18,240
to on that night when old Major 
first stirred them to rebellion.

1521
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:22,120
If she herself had had any picture of the future,  

1522
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:26,880
it had been of a society of animals 
set free from hunger and the whip,  

1523
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:33,200
all equal, each working according to his 
capacity, the strong protecting the weak,  

1524
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:39,520
as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings 
with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech.

1525
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:47,560
Instead she did not know why they had come 
to a time when no one dared speak his mind,  

1526
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:51,080
when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere,  

1527
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:57,120
and when you had to watch your comrades torn 
to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes.

1528
01:55:57,120 --> 01:56:01,280
There was no thought of rebellion 
or disobedience in her mind.

1529
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:05,160
She knew that, even as things were, they 
were far better off than they had been in  

1530
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:13,200
the days of Jones, and that before all else it was 
needful to prevent the return of the human beings.

1531
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:17,400
Whatever happened she would 
remain faithful, work hard,  

1532
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:22,240
carry out the orders that were given to 
her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon.

1533
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:30,120
But still, it was not for this that she and 
all the other animals had hoped and toiled.

1534
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:37,080
It was not for this that they had built the 
windmill and faced the bullets of Jones's gun.

1535
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:42,640
Such were her thoughts, though she 
lacked the words to express them.

1536
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:46,520
At last, feeling this to be in 
some way a substitute for the  

1537
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:52,680
words she was unable to find, she 
began to sing 'Beasts of England'.

1538
01:56:52,680 --> 01:57:00,440
The other animals sitting round her took it up, 
and they sang it three times over very tunefully,  

1539
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:06,440
but slowly and mournfully, in a 
way they had never sung it before.

1540
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:10,440
They had just finished singing it 
for the third time when Squealer,  

1541
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:16,800
attended by two dogs, approached them with 
the air of having something important to say.

1542
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:23,680
He announced that, by a special decree of Comrade 
Napoleon, 'Beasts of England' had been abolished.

1543
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:27,280
From now onwards it was forbidden to sing it.

1544
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,960
The animals were taken aback.

1545
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,720
"Why?" cried Muriel.

1546
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:36,960
"It's no longer needed, 
comrade," said Squealer stiffly.

1547
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,520
"'Beasts of England' was 
the song of the Rebellion.

1548
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:43,280
But the Rebellion is now completed.

1549
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:47,480
The execution of the traitors 
this afternoon was the final act.

1550
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:52,360
The enemy both external and 
internal has been defeated.

1551
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:58,200
In 'Beasts of England' we expressed our 
longing for a better society in days to come.

1552
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:01,120
But that society has now been established.

1553
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:05,400
Clearly this song has no longer any purpose."

1554
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:09,200
Frightened though they were, some of the 
animals might possibly have protested,  

1555
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:15,360
but at this moment the sheep set up 
their usual bleating of "Four legs good,  

1556
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:22,120
two legs bad," which went on for several 
minutes and put an end to the discussion.

1557
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:27,560
So 'Beasts of England' was heard no more.

1558
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:33,120
In its place Minimus, the poet, had 
composed another song which began:

1559
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:38,680
Animal Farm, Animal Farm, Never 
through me shalt thou come to harm!

1560
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:43,000
and this was sung every Sunday morning 
after the hoisting of the flag.

1561
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,640
But somehow neither the words 
nor the tune ever seemed to  

1562
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:52,040
the animals to come up to 'Beasts of England'.

1563
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,480
CHAPTER VIII

1564
01:58:53,480 --> 01:59:00,080
A few days later, when the terror caused by the 
executions had died down, some of the animals  

1565
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:07,080
remembered or thought they remembered that the 
Sixth Commandment decreed "No animal shall kill  

1566
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:14,240
any other animal." And though no one cared to 
mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs,  

1567
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:19,840
it was felt that the killings which had 
taken place did not square with this.

1568
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:24,240
Clover asked Benjamin to read her the 
Sixth Commandment, and when Benjamin,  

1569
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:30,080
as usual, said that he refused to meddle 
in such matters, she fetched Muriel.

1570
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,720
Muriel read the Commandment for her.

1571
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:40,760
It ran: "No animal shall kill 
any other animal WITHOUT CAUSE."

1572
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:45,520
Somehow or other, the last two words 
had slipped out of the animals' memory.

1573
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:49,600
But they saw now that the Commandment 
had not been violated; for clearly there  

1574
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:54,800
was good reason for killing the traitors 
who had leagued themselves with Snowball.

1575
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,520
Throughout the year the animals worked even 
harder than they had worked in the previous year.

1576
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:05,200
To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick 
as before, and to finish it by the appointed date,  

1577
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,240
together with the regular work of 
the farm, was a tremendous labour.

1578
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:12,040
There were times when it seemed to 
the animals that they worked longer  

1579
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:16,440
hours and fed no better than 
they had done in Jones's day.

1580
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:21,600
On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long 
strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to  

1581
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:27,240
them lists of figures proving that the production 
of every class of foodstuff had increased by two  

1582
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:31,480
hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or 
five hundred per cent, as the case might be.

1583
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:35,520
The animals saw no reason to disbelieve 
him, especially as they could no longer  

1584
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:40,160
remember very clearly what conditions 
had been like before the Rebellion.

1585
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,280
All the same, there were days when they felt that  

1586
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:47,240
they would sooner have had 
less figures and more food.

1587
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:52,000
All orders were now issued through 
Squealer or one of the other pigs.

1588
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,320
Napoleon himself was not seen in 
public as often as once in a fortnight.

1589
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:00,760
When he did appear, he was attended 
not only by his retinue of dogs but  

1590
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:04,080
by a black cockerel who marched 
in front of him and acted as a  

1591
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:10,080
kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud 
"cock-a-doodle-doo" before Napoleon spoke.

1592
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:15,760
Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon 
inhabited separate apartments from the others.

1593
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:20,480
He took his meals alone, with two dogs 
to wait upon him, and always ate from the  

1594
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:25,320
Crown Derby dinner service which had been 
in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room.

1595
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:30,280
It was also announced that the gun would 
be fired every year on Napoleon's birthday,  

1596
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:33,640
as well as on the other two anniversaries.

1597
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:39,080
Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as 
"Napoleon." He was always referred to in formal  

1598
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:46,080
style as "our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," and this 
pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father  

1599
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:54,600
of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of 
the Sheep-fold, Ducklings' Friend, and the like.

1600
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:59,960
In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the 
tears rolling down his cheeks of Napoleon's  

1601
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:05,120
wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the 
deep love he bore to all animals everywhere,  

1602
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:11,320
even and especially the unhappy animals who still 
lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms.

1603
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,560
It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit  

1604
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:18,040
for every successful achievement 
and every stroke of good fortune.

1605
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:22,840
You would often hear one hen remark to another, 
"Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade  

1606
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:29,240
Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days"; 
or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would  

1607
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:36,400
exclaim, "Thanks to the leadership of Comrade 
Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!"

1608
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:40,080
The general feeling on the farm was 
well expressed in a poem entitled  

1609
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:45,880
Comrade Napoleon, which was composed 
by Minimus and which ran as follows:

1610
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,800
Friend of fatherless!

1611
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,760
Fountain of happiness!

1612
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,920
Lord of the swill-bucket!

1613
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:58,000
Oh, how my soul is on Fire when I 
gaze at thy Calm and commanding eye,  

1614
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,880
Like the sun in the sky, Comrade Napoleon!

1615
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:10,960
Thou are the giver of All that thy creatures love, 
Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon;  

1616
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:20,560
Every beast great or small Sleeps at peace in his 
stall, Thou watchest over all, Comrade Napoleon!

1617
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:29,480
Had I a sucking-pig, Ere he had grown as big 
Even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin,  

1618
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:33,680
He should have learned to be 
Faithful and true to thee, Yes,  

1619
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:42,840
his first squeak should be "Comrade Napoleon!" 
Napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to  

1620
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:47,520
be inscribed on the wall of the big barn, at 
the opposite end from the Seven Commandments.

1621
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:54,720
It was surmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in 
profile, executed by Squealer in white paint.

1622
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,960
Meanwhile, through the agency of Whymper,  

1623
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:02,120
Napoleon was engaged in complicated 
negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington.

1624
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:05,120
The pile of timber was still unsold.

1625
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,400
Of the two, Frederick was the 
more anxious to get hold of it,  

1626
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:11,600
but he would not offer a reasonable price.

1627
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,600
At the same time there were renewed 
rumours that Frederick and his men  

1628
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:18,240
were plotting to attack Animal 
Farm and to destroy the windmill,  

1629
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:21,720
the building of which had 
aroused furious jealousy in him.

1630
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:26,320
Snowball was known to be still 
skulking on Pinchfield Farm.

1631
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:29,880
In the middle of the summer the animals were 
alarmed to hear that three hens had come  

1632
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:35,960
forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, 
they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon.

1633
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:41,360
They were executed immediately, and fresh 
precautions for Napoleon's safety were taken.

1634
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:47,360
Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at 
each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye  

1635
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:51,640
was given the task of tasting all his food 
before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.

1636
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:57,680
At about the same time it was given out 
that Napoleon had arranged to sell the  

1637
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:02,680
pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he was also 
going to enter into a regular agreement for  

1638
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:06,800
the exchange of certain products 
between Animal Farm and Foxwood.

1639
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,560
The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington,  

1640
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:14,600
though they were only conducted through 
Whymper, were now almost friendly.

1641
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:19,120
The animals distrusted Pilkington, as 
a human being, but greatly preferred  

1642
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:21,640
him to Frederick, whom they both feared and hated.

1643
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:26,840
As the summer wore on, and the 
windmill neared completion,  

1644
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:31,360
the rumours of an impending treacherous 
attack grew stronger and stronger.

1645
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:36,640
Frederick, it was said, intended to bring 
against them twenty men all armed with guns,  

1646
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,360
and he had already bribed the magistrates 
and police, so that if he could once get  

1647
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:45,120
hold of the title-deeds of Animal 
Farm they would ask no questions.

1648
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,520
Moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from  

1649
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,920
Pinchfield about the cruelties that 
Frederick practised upon his animals.

1650
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,800
He had flogged an old horse 
to death, he starved his cows,  

1651
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:00,200
he had killed a dog by throwing it into the 
furnace, he amused himself in the evenings  

1652
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:04,840
by making cocks fight with splinters 
of razor-blade tied to their spurs.

1653
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:09,600
The animals' blood boiled with rage when they 
heard of these things beingdone to their comrades,  

1654
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:13,520
and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to 
go out in a body and attack Pinchfield Farm,  

1655
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:16,760
drive out the humans, and set the animals free.

1656
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:23,360
But Squealer counselled them to avoid rash 
actions and trust in Comrade Napoleon's strategy.

1657
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:27,320
Nevertheless, feeling against 
Frederick continued to run high.

1658
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:32,040
One Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the 
barn and explained that he had never at any  

1659
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:36,680
time contemplated selling the pile of timber to 
Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity,  

1660
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:40,720
he said, to have dealings with 
scoundrels of that description.

1661
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:45,000
The pigeons who were still sent out to 
spread tidings of the Rebellion were  

1662
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,920
forbidden to set foot anywhere on Foxwood, 
and were also ordered to drop their former  

1663
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:55,080
slogan of "Death to Humanity" in 
favour of "Death to Frederick."

1664
02:06:55,080 --> 02:07:00,160
In the late summer yet another of 
Snowball's machinations was laid bare.

1665
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:03,800
The wheat crop was full of weeds, 
and it was discovered that on one  

1666
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:09,200
of his nocturnal visits Snowball had 
mixed weed seeds with the seed corn.

1667
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:13,680
A gander who had been privy to the plot 
had confessed his guilt to Squealer  

1668
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:18,960
and immediately committed suicide by 
swallowing deadly nightshade berries.

1669
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,440
The animals now also learned that 
Snowball had never as many of them  

1670
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:29,200
had believed hitherto received the order of 
"Animal Hero, First Class." This was merely  

1671
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:34,760
a legend which had been spread some time after 
the Battle of the Cowshed by Snowball himself.

1672
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:40,040
So far from being decorated, he had been 
censured for showing cowardice in the battle.

1673
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:44,200
Once again some of the animals heard 
this with a certain bewilderment,  

1674
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:49,040
but Squealer was soon able to convince 
them that their memories had been at fault.

1675
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:56,080
In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting 
effort for the harvest had to be gathered  

1676
02:07:56,080 --> 02:08:00,480
at almost the same time the windmill was finished.

1677
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,640
The machinery had still to be installed,  

1678
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:07,880
and Whymper was negotiating the purchase 
of it, but the structure was completed.

1679
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:12,800
In the teeth of every difficulty, in spite 
of inexperience, of primitive implements,  

1680
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:18,280
of bad luck and of Snowball's treachery, 
the work had been finished punctually to the  

1681
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:25,080
very day! Tired out but proud, the animals 
walked round and round their masterpiece,  

1682
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:29,720
which appeared even more beautiful in their 
eyes than when it had been built the first time.

1683
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:32,640
Moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before.

1684
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:37,000
Nothing short of explosives 
would lay them low this time!

1685
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,840
And when they thought of how they had laboured, 
what discouragements they had overcome,  

1686
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,560
and the enormous difference that would 
be made in their lives when the sails  

1687
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:50,760
were turning and the dynamos running when they 
thought of all this, their tiredness forsook  

1688
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:55,720
them and they gambolled round and round 
the windmill, uttering cries of triumph.

1689
02:08:55,720 --> 02:09:01,480
Napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his 
cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work;  

1690
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:04,920
he personally congratulated the 
animals on their achievement,  

1691
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:10,480
and announced that the mill 
would be named Napoleon Mill.

1692
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:15,080
Two days later the animals were called 
together for a special meeting in the barn.

1693
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:17,600
They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon  

1694
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:21,480
announced that he had sold the 
pile of timber to Frederick.

1695
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:25,720
Tomorrow Frederick's wagons would 
arrive and begin carting it away.

1696
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:29,160
Throughout the whole period of his 
seeming friendship with Pilkington,  

1697
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:33,080
Napoleon had really been in 
secret agreement with Frederick.

1698
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:38,960
All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; 
insulting messages had been sent to Pilkington.

1699
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:43,600
The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield 
Farm and to alter their slogan from "Death  

1700
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:49,320
to Frederick" to "Death to Pilkington." At 
the same time Napoleon assured the animals  

1701
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:53,360
that the stories of an impending attack 
on Animal Farm were completely untrue,  

1702
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:58,400
and that the tales about Frederick's cruelty to 
his own animals had been greatly exaggerated.

1703
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:03,160
All these rumours had probably 
originated with Snowball and his agents.

1704
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:07,440
It now appeared that Snowball was not, 
after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm,  

1705
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:12,000
and in fact had never been there in his 
life: he was living in considerable luxury,  

1706
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,840
so it was said at Foxwood, and had in reality 
been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.

1707
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:22,320
The pigs were in ecstasies 
over Napoleon's cunning.

1708
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:25,000
By seeming to be friendly with Pilkington he had  

1709
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,120
forced Frederick to raise 
his price by twelve pounds.

1710
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,600
But the superior quality of Napoleon's mind,  

1711
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:36,640
said Squealer, was shown in the fact that 
he trusted nobody, not even Frederick.

1712
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:41,120
Frederick had wanted to pay for the 
timber with something called a cheque,  

1713
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:45,720
which, it seemed, was a piece of paper 
with a promise to pay written upon it.

1714
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,840
But Napoleon was too clever for him.

1715
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,960
He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes,  

1716
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,560
which were to be handed over 
before the timber was removed.

1717
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,000
Already Frederick had paid up;  

1718
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,360
and the sum he had paid was just enough 
to buy the machinery for the windmill.

1719
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:05,840
Meanwhile the timber was being 
carted away at high speed.

1720
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,960
When it was all gone, another special meeting was  

1721
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:12,000
held in the barn for the animals 
to inspect Frederick's bank-notes.

1722
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,920
Smiling beatifically, and wearing both his 
decorations, Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on  

1723
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:24,360
the platform, with the money at his side, neatly 
piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen.

1724
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:29,320
The animals filed slowly 
past, and each gazed his fill.

1725
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:33,200
And Boxer put out his nose 
to sniff at the bank-notes,  

1726
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:37,680
and the flimsy white things 
stirred and rustled in his breath.

1727
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:40,520
Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo.

1728
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:44,400
Whymper, his face deadly pale, came 
racing up the path on his bicycle,  

1729
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:48,240
flung it down in the yard and 
rushed straight into the farmhouse.

1730
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:53,000
The next moment a choking roar of rage 
sounded from Napoleon's apartments.

1731
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,760
The news of what had happened 
sped round the farm like wildfire.

1732
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:59,200
The banknotes were forgeries!

1733
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:02,600
Frederick had got the timber for nothing!

1734
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:04,560
Napoleon called the animals together immediately  

1735
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:08,480
and in a terrible voice pronounced 
the death sentence upon Frederick.

1736
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:12,000
When captured, he said, 
Frederick should be boiled alive.

1737
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,240
At the same time he warned them that after this 
treacherous deed the worst was to be expected.

1738
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:20,320
Frederick and his men might make their 
long-expected attack at any moment.

1739
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:24,080
Sentinels were placed at all 
the approaches to the farm.

1740
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:28,720
In addition, four pigeons were sent to 
Foxwood with a conciliatory message,  

1741
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:33,320
which it was hoped might re-establish 
good relations with Pilkington.

1742
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:36,400
The very next morning the attack came.

1743
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:39,000
The animals were at breakfast when 
the look-outs came racing in with the  

1744
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,400
news that Frederick and his followers had 
already come through the five-barred gate.

1745
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:46,200
Boldly enough the animals 
sallied forth to meet them,  

1746
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:51,200
but this time they did not have the easy victory 
that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed.

1747
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:54,760
There were fifteen men, with 
half a dozen guns between them,  

1748
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:58,120
and they opened fire as soon 
as they got within fifty yards.

1749
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:02,160
The animals could not face the terrible 
explosions and the stinging pellets,  

1750
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:07,360
and in spite of the efforts of Napoleon and 
Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back.

1751
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:09,480
A number of them were already wounded.

1752
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:14,920
They took refuge in the farm buildings and 
peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes.

1753
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:20,440
The whole of the big pasture, including the 
windmill, was in the hands of the enemy.

1754
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:23,520
For the moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss.

1755
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,920
He paced up and down without a 
word, his tail rigid and twitching.

1756
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,880
Wistful glances were sent 
in the direction of Foxwood.

1757
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:35,040
If Pilkington and his men would 
help them, the day might yet be won.

1758
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:38,560
But at this moment the four pigeons, 
who had been sent out on the day before,  

1759
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:42,680
returned, one of them bearing a 
scrap of paper from Pilkington.

1760
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:44,680
On it was pencilled the words:  

1761
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:51,040
"Serves you right." Meanwhile Frederick 
and his men had halted about the windmill.

1762
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:55,920
The animals watched them, and 
a murmur of dismay went round.

1763
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:59,200
Two of the men had produced a 
crowbar and a sledge hammer.

1764
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:02,120
They were going to knock the windmill down.

1765
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:04,520
"Impossible!" cried Napoleon.

1766
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:06,800
"We have built the walls far too thick for that.

1767
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:09,200
They could not knock it down in a week.

1768
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:11,560
Courage, comrades!"

1769
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:15,520
But Benjamin was watching the 
movements of the men intently.

1770
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:20,640
The two with the hammer and the crowbar were 
drilling a hole near the base of the windmill.

1771
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:27,680
Slowly, and with an air almost of 
amusement, Benjamin nodded his long muzzle.

1772
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:30,200
"I thought so," he said.

1773
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:33,000
"Do you not see what they are doing?

1774
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:38,920
In another moment they are going to 
pack blasting powder into that hole."

1775
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:41,600
Terrified, the animals waited.

1776
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:45,080
It was impossible now to venture 
out of the shelter of the buildings.

1777
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:48,640
After a few minutes the men were 
seen to be running in all directions.

1778
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:51,440
Then there was a deafening roar.

1779
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:54,640
The pigeons swirled into the 
air, and all the animals,  

1780
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:59,520
except Napoleon, flung themselves flat 
on their bellies and hid their faces.

1781
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:06,240
When they got up again, a huge cloud of black 
smoke was hanging where the windmill had been.

1782
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:09,240
Slowly the breeze drifted it away.

1783
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:12,640
The windmill had ceased to exist!

1784
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:15,880
At this sight the animals' 
courage returned to them.

1785
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:19,560
The fear and despair they had felt 
a moment earlier were drowned in  

1786
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:22,800
their rage against this vile, contemptible act.

1787
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:26,960
A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and 
without waiting for further orders they  

1788
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:30,440
charged forth in a body and 
made straight for the enemy.

1789
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:34,160
This time they did not heed the cruel 
pellets that swept over them like hail.

1790
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:36,120
It was a savage, bitter battle.

1791
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:39,720
The men fired again and again, and, 
when the animals got to close quarters,  

1792
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:42,400
lashed out with their sticks 
and their heavy boots.

1793
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:48,040
A cow, three sheep, and two geese were 
killed, and nearly everyone was wounded.

1794
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:51,000
Even Napoleon, who was directing 
operations from the rear,  

1795
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,360
had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet.

1796
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:56,120
But the men did not go unscathed either.

1797
02:15:56,120 --> 02:16:00,800
Three of them had their heads broken by blows from 
Boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the belly by  

1798
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:05,880
a cow's horn; another had his trousers 
nearly torn off by Jessie and Bluebell.

1799
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:08,560
And when the nine dogs of 
Napoleon's own bodyguard,  

1800
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:11,520
whom he had instructed to make a 
detour under cover of the hedge,  

1801
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:16,520
suddenly appeared on the men's flank, 
baying ferociously, panic overtook them.

1802
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:19,040
They saw that they were in 
danger of being surrounded.

1803
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:22,040
Frederick shouted to his men to 
get out while the going was good,  

1804
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:25,480
and the next moment the cowardly 
enemy was running for dear life.

1805
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:27,960
The animals chased them right 
down to the bottom of the field,  

1806
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:33,280
and got in some last kicks at them as they 
forced their way through the thorn hedge.

1807
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,240
They had won, but they were weary and bleeding.

1808
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:40,760
Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm.

1809
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:46,440
The sight of their dead comrades stretched 
upon the grass moved some of them to tears.

1810
02:16:46,439 --> 02:16:49,599
And for a little while they 
halted in sorrowful silence  

1811
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:53,161
at the place where the windmill had once stood.

1812
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:59,080
Yes, it was gone; almost the last 
trace of their labour was gone!

1813
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:02,479
Even the foundations were partially destroyed.

1814
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:07,679
And in rebuilding it they could not this time, 
as before, make use of the fallen stones.

1815
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:10,320
This time the stones had vanished too.

1816
02:17:10,319 --> 02:17:14,759
The force of the explosion had flung 
them to distances of hundreds of yards.

1817
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:18,480
It was as though the windmill had never been.

1818
02:17:18,479 --> 02:17:24,759
As they approached the farm Squealer, who had 
unaccountably been absent during the fighting,  

1819
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:30,360
came skipping towards them, whisking 
his tail and beaming with satisfaction.

1820
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:36,719
And the animals heard, from the direction of 
the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.

1821
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:40,800
"What is that gun firing for?" said Boxer.

1822
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:44,720
"To celebrate our victory!" cried Squealer.

1823
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:47,640
"What victory?" said Boxer.

1824
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:50,840
His knees were bleeding, he had 
lost a shoe and split his hoof,  

1825
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:55,160
and a dozen pellets had lodged 
themselves in his hind leg.

1826
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:57,040
"What victory, comrade?

1827
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:02,519
Have we not driven the enemy off our 
soil the sacred soil of Animal Farm?"

1828
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:05,201
"But they have destroyed the windmill.

1829
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:07,880
And we had worked on it for two years!"

1830
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:08,680
"What matter?

1831
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,360
We will build another windmill.

1832
02:18:10,359 --> 02:18:13,080
We will build six windmills if we feel like it.

1833
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:16,760
You do not appreciate, comrade, 
the mighty thing that we have done.

1834
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:20,480
The enemy was in occupation of this 
very ground that we stand upon.

1835
02:18:20,479 --> 02:18:27,399
And now thanks to the leadership of Comrade 
Napoleon we have won every inch of it back again!"

1836
02:18:27,399 --> 02:18:31,559
"Then we have won back what 
we had before," said Boxer.

1837
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:35,281
"That is our victory," said Squealer.

1838
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,359
They limped into the yard.

1839
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:41,679
The pellets under the skin of 
Boxer's leg smarted painfully.

1840
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:47,080
He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of 
rebuilding the windmill from the foundations,  

1841
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,720
and already in imagination he 
braced himself for the task.

1842
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:57,400
But for the first time it occurred to 
him that he was eleven years old and  

1843
02:18:57,399 --> 02:19:02,839
that perhaps his great muscles were 
not quite what they had once been.

1844
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:07,800
But when the animals saw the green flag 
flying, and heard the gun firing again  

1845
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:13,160
seven times it was fired in all and heard 
the speech that Napoleon made, congratulating  

1846
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:19,760
them on their conduct, it did seem to them 
after all that they had won a great victory.

1847
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:23,480
The animals slain in the battle 
were given a solemn funeral.

1848
02:19:23,479 --> 02:19:26,919
Boxer and Clover pulled the 
wagon which served as a hearse,  

1849
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:31,160
and Napoleon himself walked 
at the head of the procession.

1850
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:34,080
Two whole days were given over to celebrations.

1851
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:39,600
There were songs, speeches, and more firing of the 
gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed  

1852
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:46,161
on every animal, with two ounces of corn for 
each bird and three biscuits for each dog.

1853
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:51,359
It was announced that the battle would be called 
the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon had  

1854
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:58,599
created a new decoration, the Order of the Green 
Banner, which he had conferred upon himself.

1855
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:07,000
In the general rejoicings the unfortunate 
affair of the banknotes was forgotten.

1856
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,960
It was a few days later than this that the pigs  

1857
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:14,399
came upon a case of whisky in 
the cellars of the farmhouse.

1858
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:18,160
It had been overlooked at the time 
when the house was first occupied.

1859
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:23,319
That night there came from the farmhouse 
the sound of loud singing, in which,  

1860
02:20:23,319 --> 02:20:29,080
to everyone's surprise, the strains 
of 'Beasts of England' were mixed up.

1861
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:35,800
At about half past nine Napoleon, wearing an old 
bowler hat of Mr. Jones's, was distinctly seen  

1862
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:43,200
to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly 
round the yard, and disappear indoors again.

1863
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:48,200
But in the morning a deep 
silence hung over the farmhouse.

1864
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,080
Not a pig appeared to be stirring.

1865
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:57,479
It was nearly nine o'clock when Squealer made 
his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly,  

1866
02:20:57,479 --> 02:21:05,359
his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, 
and with every appearance of being seriously ill.

1867
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:11,439
He called the animals together and told them 
that he had a terrible piece of news to impart.

1868
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:15,120
Comrade Napoleon was dying!

1869
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,559
A cry of lamentation went up.

1870
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:23,360
Straw was laid down outside the doors of the 
farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe.

1871
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:26,519
With tears in their eyes they 
asked one another what they  

1872
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,880
should do if their Leader 
were taken away from them.

1873
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:32,880
A rumour went round that Snowball had after  

1874
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:37,640
all contrived to introduce 
poison into Napoleon's food.

1875
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:41,920
At eleven o'clock Squealer came 
out to make another announcement.

1876
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:48,520
As his last act upon earth, Comrade 
Napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree:  

1877
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:54,760
the drinking of alcohol was 
to be punished by death.

1878
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:59,120
By the evening, however, Napoleon 
appeared to be somewhat better,  

1879
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:04,000
and the following morning Squealer was able to 
tell them that he was well on the way to recovery.

1880
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,319
By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at 
work, and on the next day it was learned that he  

1881
02:22:09,319 --> 02:22:15,160
had instructed Whymper to purchase in Willingdon 
some booklets on brewing and distilling.

1882
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:20,040
A week later Napoleon gave orders that 
the small paddock beyond the orchard,  

1883
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:24,200
which it had previously been intended 
to set aside as a grazing-ground for  

1884
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:28,479
animals who were past work, was to be ploughed up.

1885
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:32,399
It was given out that the pasture 
was exhausted and needed re-seeding;  

1886
02:22:32,399 --> 02:22:38,759
but it soon became known that Napoleon 
intended to sow it with barley.

1887
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:44,920
About this time there occurred a strange incident 
which hardly anyone was able to understand.

1888
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:49,319
One night at about twelve o'clock 
there was a loud crash in the yard,  

1889
02:22:49,319 --> 02:22:51,960
and the animals rushed out of their stalls.

1890
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:54,080
It was a moonlit night.

1891
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:56,479
At the foot of the end wall of the big barn,  

1892
02:22:56,479 --> 02:23:02,200
where the Seven Commandments were written, 
there lay a ladder broken in two pieces.

1893
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:07,679
Squealer, temporarily stunned, was 
sprawling beside it, and near at hand  

1894
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:13,160
there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, 
and an overturned pot of white paint.

1895
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:16,040
The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer,  

1896
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:20,760
and escorted him back to the farmhouse 
as soon as he was able to walk.

1897
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:25,960
None of the animals could form any idea as 
to what this meant, except old Benjamin,  

1898
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:33,200
who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and 
seemed to understand, but would say nothing.

1899
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:38,760
But a few days later Muriel, reading 
over the Seven Commandments to herself,  

1900
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:44,400
noticed that there was yet another of them 
which the animals had remembered wrong.

1901
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:49,719
They had thought the Fifth Commandment 
was "No animal shall drink alcohol,"  

1902
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:52,880
but there were two words that they had forgotten.

1903
02:23:52,880 --> 02:24:03,150
Actually the Commandment read: "No 
animal shall drink alcohol TO EXCESS."

1904
02:24:03,150 --> 02:24:03,160
CHAPTER IX

1905
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:06,680
Boxer's split hoof was a long time in healing.

1906
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:11,880
They had started the rebuilding of the windmill 
the day after the victory celebrations were ended.

1907
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:14,600
Boxer refused to take even a day off work,  

1908
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:19,080
and made it a point of honour not to 
let it be seen that he was in pain.

1909
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:24,399
In the evenings he would admit privately to 
Clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal.

1910
02:24:24,399 --> 02:24:29,439
Clover treated the hoof with poultices of 
herbs which she prepared by chewing them,  

1911
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:34,040
and both she and Benjamin 
urged Boxer to work less hard.

1912
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:38,120
"A horse's lungs do not last 
for ever," she said to him.

1913
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:40,040
But Boxer would not listen.

1914
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:43,800
He had, he said, only one 
real ambition left to see  

1915
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:49,080
the windmill well under way before 
he reached the age for retirement.

1916
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:53,080
At the beginning, when the laws of 
Animal Farm were first formulated,  

1917
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:59,800
the retiring age had been fixed for horses 
and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen,  

1918
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:06,120
for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, 
and for hens and geese at five.

1919
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:10,080
Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon.

1920
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:13,559
As yet no animal had actually retired on pension,  

1921
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:17,000
but of late the subject had 
been discussed more and more.

1922
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,319
Now that the small field beyond the 
orchard had been set aside for barley,  

1923
02:25:21,399 --> 02:25:23,719
it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture  

1924
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:28,640
was to be fenced off and turned into a 
grazing-ground for superannuated animals.

1925
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:34,280
For a horse, it was said, the pension would 
be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter,  

1926
02:25:34,279 --> 02:25:39,679
fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or 
possibly an apple on public holidays.

1927
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:45,280
Boxer's twelfth birthday was due in 
the late summer of the following year.

1928
02:25:45,279 --> 02:25:48,160
Meanwhile life was hard.

1929
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,160
The winter was as cold as the last one 
had been, and food was even shorter.

1930
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:58,080
Once again all rations were reduced, 
except those of the pigs and the dogs.

1931
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:01,960
A too rigid equality in 
rations, Squealer explained,  

1932
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:05,160
would have been contrary to 
the principles of Animalism.

1933
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:08,040
In any case he had no difficulty 
in proving to the other animals  

1934
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:13,319
that they were NOT in reality short of 
food, whatever the appearances might be.

1935
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:17,840
For the time being, certainly, it had been 
found necessary to make a readjustment of  

1936
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:23,200
rations (Squealer always spoke of it as a 
"readjustment," never as a "reduction"),  

1937
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:27,639
but in comparison with the days of 
Jones, the improvement was enormous.

1938
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:32,080
Reading out the figures in a shrill, 
rapid voice, he proved to them in detail  

1939
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:36,680
that they had more oats, more hay, more 
turnips than they had had in Jones's day,  

1940
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:41,040
that they worked shorter hours, that their 
drinking water was of better quality,  

1941
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:45,040
that they lived longer, that a larger 
proportion of their young ones survived  

1942
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:50,560
infancy, and that they had more straw in 
their stalls and suffered less from fleas.

1943
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:53,680
The animals believed every word of it.

1944
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:59,360
Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for 
had almost faded out of their memories.

1945
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:03,880
They knew that life nowadays was harsh and 
bare, that they were often hungry and often  

1946
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:08,359
cold, and that they were usually 
working when they were not asleep.

1947
02:27:08,359 --> 02:27:11,960
But doubtless it had been worse in the old days.

1948
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:14,480
They were glad to believe so.

1949
02:27:14,479 --> 02:27:18,200
Besides, in those days they had 
been slaves and now they were free,  

1950
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:23,599
and that made all the difference, as 
Squealer did not fail to point out.

1951
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:26,520
There were many more mouths to feed now.

1952
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:30,400
In the autumn the four sows had 
all littered about simultaneously,  

1953
02:27:30,399 --> 02:27:33,799
producing thirty-one young pigs between them.

1954
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:39,680
The young pigs were piebald, and as 
Napoleon was the only boar on the farm,  

1955
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:43,280
it was possible to guess at their parentage.

1956
02:27:43,279 --> 02:27:47,160
It was announced that later, when 
bricks and timber had been purchased,  

1957
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:50,519
a schoolroom would be built 
in the farmhouse garden.

1958
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:52,640
For the time being, the young pigs were  

1959
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:56,680
given their instruction by Napoleon 
himself in the farmhouse kitchen.

1960
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:58,960
They took their exercise in the garden,  

1961
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:03,040
and were discouraged from playing 
with the other young animals.

1962
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:07,319
About this time, too, it was laid down 
as a rule that when a pig and any other  

1963
02:28:07,319 --> 02:28:13,519
animal met on the path, the other animal 
must stand aside: and also that all pigs,  

1964
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:20,121
of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of 
wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.

1965
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:26,279
The farm had had a fairly successful 
year, but was still short of money.

1966
02:28:26,279 --> 02:28:30,279
There were the bricks, sand, and lime 
for the schoolroom to be purchased,  

1967
02:28:30,279 --> 02:28:35,040
and it would also be necessary to begin saving 
up again for the machinery for the windmill.

1968
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:40,560
Then there were lamp oil and candles for 
the house, sugar for Napoleon's own table  

1969
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:44,360
(he forbade this to the other pigs, on 
the ground that it made them fat), and  

1970
02:28:44,359 --> 02:28:52,519
all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, 
string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits.

1971
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:56,201
A stump of hay and part of 
the potato crop were sold off,  

1972
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:59,519
and the contract for eggs was 
increased to six hundred a week,  

1973
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:05,241
so that that year the hens barely hatched enough 
chicks to keep their numbers at the same level.

1974
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:09,359
Rations, reduced in December, 
were reduced again in February,  

1975
02:29:09,359 --> 02:29:13,439
and lanterns in the stalls 
were forbidden to save oil.

1976
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:19,279
But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and 
in fact were putting on weight if anything.

1977
02:29:19,279 --> 02:29:23,800
One afternoon in late February 
a warm, rich, appetising scent,  

1978
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:29,080
such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted 
itself across the yard from the little brew-house,  

1979
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:34,040
which had been disused in Jones's time, 
and which stood beyond the kitchen.

1980
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:37,160
Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley.

1981
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:39,840
The animals sniffed the air 
hungrily and wondered whether  

1982
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:43,240
a warm mash was being prepared for their supper.

1983
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:46,639
But no warm mash appeared, and 
on the following Sunday it was  

1984
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:52,201
announced that from now onwards all 
barley would be reserved for the pigs.

1985
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:56,120
The field beyond the orchard had 
already been sown with barley.

1986
02:29:56,120 --> 02:30:02,160
And the news soon leaked out that every pig was 
now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily,  

1987
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:04,840
with half a gallon for Napoleon himself,  

1988
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:09,200
which was always served to him 
in the Crown Derby soup tureen.

1989
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,960
But if there were hardships 
to be borne, they were partly  

1990
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:18,680
offset by the fact that life nowadays had 
a greater dignity than it had had before.

1991
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:23,600
There were more songs, more 
speeches, more processions.

1992
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:26,280
Napoleon had commanded that 
once a week there should be  

1993
02:30:26,279 --> 02:30:30,080
held something called a Spontaneous Demonstration,  

1994
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:35,600
the object of which was to celebrate the 
struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm.

1995
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:39,680
At the appointed time the animals would 
leave their work and march round the  

1996
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:44,040
precincts of the farm in military 
formation, with the pigs leading,  

1997
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:49,160
then the horses, then the cows, then 
the sheep, and then the poultry.

1998
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:55,319
The dogs flanked the procession and at the 
head of all marched Napoleon's black cockerel.

1999
02:30:55,319 --> 02:30:59,439
Boxer and Clover always carried between 
them a green banner marked with the hoof  

2000
02:30:59,439 --> 02:31:04,399
and the horn and the caption, 
"Long live Comrade Napoleon!"

2001
02:31:04,399 --> 02:31:09,000
Afterwards there were recitations of 
poems composed in Napoleon's honour,  

2002
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,640
and a speech by Squealer giving 
particulars of the latest increases  

2003
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:18,880
in the production of foodstuffs, and on 
occasion a shot was fired from the gun.

2004
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:23,319
The sheep were the greatest devotees 
of the Spontaneous Demonstration,  

2005
02:31:23,319 --> 02:31:28,120
and if anyone complained (as a few animals 
sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were  

2006
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:33,000
near) that they wasted time and meant a lot 
of standing about in the cold, the sheep  

2007
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:40,840
were sure to silence him with a tremendous 
bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!"

2008
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:44,520
But by and large the animals 
enjoyed these celebrations.

2009
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:47,280
They found it comforting to 
be reminded that, after all,  

2010
02:31:47,279 --> 02:31:53,160
they were truly their own masters and that 
the work they did was for their own benefit.

2011
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:57,399
So that, what with the songs, the 
processions, Squealer's lists of figures,  

2012
02:31:57,399 --> 02:32:02,240
the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the 
cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag,  

2013
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:08,800
they were able to forget that their bellies 
were empty, at least part of the time.

2014
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:16,640
In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, 
and it became necessary to elect a President.

2015
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:22,280
There was only one candidate, 
Napoleon, who was elected unanimously.

2016
02:32:22,279 --> 02:32:25,800
On the same day it was given out that 
fresh documents had been discovered  

2017
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:31,000
which revealed further details about 
Snowball's complicity with Jones.

2018
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,560
It now appeared that Snowball had not, 
as the animals had previously imagined,  

2019
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:39,800
merely attempted to lose the Battle of 
the Cowshed by means of a stratagem,  

2020
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:43,320
but had been openly fighting on Jones's side.

2021
02:32:43,319 --> 02:32:47,120
In fact, it was he who had actually 
been the leader of the human forces,  

2022
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:52,120
and had charged into battle with the 
words "Long live Humanity!" on his lips.

2023
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:56,479
The wounds on Snowball's back, which a few 
of the animals still remembered to have seen,  

2024
02:32:56,479 --> 02:33:00,359
had been inflicted by Napoleon's teeth.

2025
02:33:00,359 --> 02:33:05,599
In the middle of the summer Moses the 
raven suddenly reappeared on the farm,  

2026
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:08,280
after an absence of several years.

2027
02:33:08,279 --> 02:33:11,040
He was quite unchanged, still did no work,  

2028
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:15,399
and talked in the same strain as 
ever about Sugarcandy Mountain.

2029
02:33:15,399 --> 02:33:21,759
He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, 
and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen.

2030
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:28,440
"Up there, comrades," he would say solemnly, 
pointing to the sky with his large beak "up there,  

2031
02:33:28,439 --> 02:33:35,359
just on the other side of that dark cloud that 
you can see there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain,  

2032
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:41,599
that happy country where we poor animals 
shall rest for ever from our labours!"

2033
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:45,840
He even claimed to have been there on one 
of his higher flights, and to have seen the  

2034
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:51,240
everlasting fields of clover and the linseed 
cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges.

2035
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:53,599
Many of the animals believed him.

2036
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:57,241
Their lives now, they reasoned, 
were hungry and laborious;  

2037
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:01,880
was it not right and just that a better 
world should exist somewhere else?

2038
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:07,440
A thing that was difficult to determine 
was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses.

2039
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:13,200
They all declared contemptuously that his stories 
about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet they  

2040
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:19,720
allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, 
with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.

2041
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:24,960
After his hoof had healed up, 
Boxer worked harder than ever.

2042
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:28,240
Indeed, all the animals 
worked like slaves that year.

2043
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,840
Apart from the regular work of the farm, 
and the rebuilding of the windmill,  

2044
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:36,680
there was the schoolhouse for the 
young pigs, which was started in March.

2045
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:43,480
Sometimes the long hours on insufficient food 
were hard to bear, but Boxer never faltered.

2046
02:34:43,479 --> 02:34:49,080
In nothing that he said or did was there any 
sign that his strength was not what it had been.

2047
02:34:49,080 --> 02:34:52,399
It was only his appearance 
that was a little altered;  

2048
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:59,559
his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, 
and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken.

2049
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:04,280
The others said, "Boxer will pick 
up when the spring grass comes on";  

2050
02:35:04,279 --> 02:35:08,920
but the spring came and Boxer grew no fatter.

2051
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:11,399
Sometimes on the slope leading 
to the top of the quarry,  

2052
02:35:11,399 --> 02:35:15,599
when he braced his muscles against 
the weight of some vast boulder,  

2053
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:19,640
it seemed that nothing kept him on 
his feet except the will to continue.

2054
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:30,480
At such times his lips were seen to form the 
words, "I will work harder"; he had no voice left.

2055
02:35:30,479 --> 02:35:37,040
Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take 
care of his health, but Boxer paid no attention.

2056
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:39,600
His twelfth birthday was approaching.

2057
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:42,640
He did not care what happened 
so long as a good store of  

2058
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:47,720
stone was accumulated before he went on pension.

2059
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:50,080
Late one evening in the summer,  

2060
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:53,960
a sudden rumour ran round the farm 
that something had happened to Boxer.

2061
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:58,319
He had gone out alone to drag a 
load of stone down to the windmill.

2062
02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:01,080
And sure enough, the rumour was true.

2063
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:04,840
A few minutes later two pigeons 
came racing in with the news;  

2064
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:10,040
"Boxer has fallen! He is lying 
on his side and can't get up!"

2065
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:14,240
About half the animals on the farm rushed 
out to the knoll where the windmill stood.

2066
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:19,639
There lay Boxer, between the shafts 
of the cart, his neck stretched out,  

2067
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:21,920
unable even to raise his head.

2068
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:25,640
His eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat.

2069
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:29,600
A thin stream of blood had 
trickled out of his mouth.

2070
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:32,720
Clover dropped to her knees at his side.

2071
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:36,480
"Boxer!" she cried, "how are you?"

2072
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:40,519
"It is my lung," said Boxer in a weak voice.

2073
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:42,800
"It does not matter.

2074
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:46,760
I think you will be able to 
finish the windmill without me.

2075
02:36:46,760 --> 02:36:49,520
There is a pretty good store of stone accumulated.

2076
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:54,201
I had only another month to go in any case.

2077
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:59,160
To tell you the truth, I had been 
looking forward to my retirement.

2078
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:02,800
And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too,  

2079
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:08,760
they will let him retire at the 
same time and be a companion to me."

2080
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:11,320
"We must get help at once," said Clover.

2081
02:37:11,319 --> 02:37:14,840
"Run, somebody, and tell 
Squealer what has happened."

2082
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:19,640
All the other animals immediately raced back 
to the farmhouse to give Squealer the news.

2083
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:23,840
Only Clover remained, and Benjamin 
who lay down at Boxer's side,  

2084
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:28,279
and, without speaking, kept the 
flies off him with his long tail.

2085
02:37:28,279 --> 02:37:33,040
After about a quarter of an hour Squealer 
appeared, full of sympathy and concern.

2086
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:36,640
He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned 
with the very deepest distress of this  

2087
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:40,600
misfortune to one of the most loyal 
workers on the farm, and was already  

2088
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:45,560
making arrangements to send Boxer to be 
treated in the hospital at Willingdon.

2089
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:48,800
The animals felt a little uneasy at this.

2090
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:54,200
Except for Mollie and Snowball, no 
other animal had ever left the farm,  

2091
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:59,359
and they did not like to think of their 
sick comrade in the hands of human beings.

2092
02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:02,559
However, Squealer easily convinced 
them that the veterinary surgeon  

2093
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:07,960
in Willingdon could treat Boxer's case more 
satisfactorily than could be done on the farm.

2094
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:11,840
And about half an hour later, 
when Boxer had somewhat recovered,  

2095
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:16,120
he was with difficulty got on to his 
feet, and managed to limp back to his  

2096
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:21,680
stall, where Clover and Benjamin had 
prepared a good bed of straw for him.

2097
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:25,160
For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall.

2098
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:28,519
The pigs had sent out a large bottle 
of pink medicine which they had found  

2099
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:35,000
in the medicine chest in the bathroom, and Clover 
administered it to Boxer twice a day after meals.

2100
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:40,439
In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked 
to him, while Benjamin kept the flies off him.

2101
02:38:40,439 --> 02:38:44,040
Boxer professed not to be 
sorry for what had happened.

2102
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:48,120
If he made a good recovery, he might 
expect to live another three years,  

2103
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:53,200
and he looked forward to the peaceful days that 
he would spend in the corner of the big pasture.

2104
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:57,519
It would be the first time that he had 
had leisure to study and improve his mind.

2105
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:01,121
He intended, he said, to devote 
the rest of his life to learning  

2106
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:05,559
the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet.

2107
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:10,280
However, Benjamin and Clover could 
only be with Boxer after working hours,  

2108
02:39:10,279 --> 02:39:14,399
and it was in the middle of the day 
when the van came to take him away.

2109
02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:19,399
The animals were all at work weeding 
turnips under the supervision of a pig,  

2110
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:22,279
when they were astonished to see 
Benjamin come galloping from the  

2111
02:39:22,279 --> 02:39:26,080
direction of the farm buildings, 
braying at the top of his voice.

2112
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:29,359
It was the first time that they had 
ever seen Benjamin excited indeed,  

2113
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:32,399
it was the first time that 
anyone had ever seen him gallop.

2114
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:34,040
"Quick, quick!" he shouted.

2115
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:37,680
"Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!"

2116
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:39,640
Without waiting for orders from the pig,  

2117
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:43,520
the animals broke off work and 
raced back to the farm buildings.

2118
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:48,920
Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed 
van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its  

2119
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:54,399
side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned 
bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat.

2120
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:57,120
And Boxer's stall was empty.

2121
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:59,279
The animals crowded round the van.

2122
02:39:59,279 --> 02:40:02,319
"Good-bye, Boxer!" they chorused, "good-bye!"

2123
02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:03,120
"Fools!

2124
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:08,399
Fools!" shouted Benjamin, prancing round them 
and stamping the earth with his small hoofs.

2125
02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:09,040
"Fools!

2126
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:13,120
Do you not see what is written 
on the side of that van?"

2127
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:16,319
That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush.

2128
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:18,719
Muriel began to spell out the words.

2129
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:23,440
But Benjamin pushed her aside and in 
the midst of a deadly silence he read:

2130
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:29,399
"'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer 
and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.

2131
02:40:29,399 --> 02:40:32,279
Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal.

2132
02:40:32,279 --> 02:40:34,399
Kennels Supplied.'

2133
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:40,359
Do you not understand what that means? 
They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!"

2134
02:40:40,359 --> 02:40:43,359
A cry of horror burst from all the animals.

2135
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:45,399
At this moment the man on the box whipped up his  

2136
02:40:45,399 --> 02:40:48,879
horses and the van moved out 
of the yard at a smart trot.

2137
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:52,319
All the animals followed, crying 
out at the tops of their voices.

2138
02:40:52,319 --> 02:40:54,240
Clover forced her way to the front.

2139
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,240
The van began to gather speed.

2140
02:40:56,240 --> 02:41:00,439
Clover tried to stir her stout limbs 
to a gallop, and achieved a canter.

2141
02:41:00,439 --> 02:41:01,879
"Boxer!" she cried.

2142
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:02,760
"Boxer!

2143
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:03,520
Boxer!

2144
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:04,800
Boxer!"

2145
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,560
And just at this moment, as though he had 
heard the uproar outside, Boxer's face,  

2146
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:13,040
with the white stripe down his nose, appeared 
at the small window at the back of the van.

2147
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:15,920
"Boxer!" cried Clover in a terrible voice.

2148
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:21,720
"Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly! 
They're taking you to your death!"

2149
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:25,120
All the animals took up the cry 
of "Get out, Boxer, get out!"

2150
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:28,319
But the van was already gathering 
speed and drawing away from them.

2151
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:31,880
It was uncertain whether Boxer had 
understood what Clover had said.

2152
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:34,960
But a moment later his face disappeared 
from the window and there was the sound  

2153
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:37,520
of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van.

2154
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:39,480
He was trying to kick his way out.

2155
02:41:39,479 --> 02:41:44,240
The time had been when a few kicks from Boxer's 
hoofs would have smashed the van to matchwood.

2156
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,040
But alas!

2157
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:49,240
his strength had left him; and in a few moments 
the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter  

2158
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,640
and died away.

2159
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:56,280
In desperation the animals began appealing 
to the two horses which drew the van to stop.

2160
02:41:56,279 --> 02:41:58,120
"Comrades, comrades!" they shouted.

2161
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:00,760
"Don't take your own brother to his death! "

2162
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:03,880
But the stupid brutes, too ignorant 
to realise what was happening,  

2163
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:07,200
merely set back their ears 
and quickened their pace.

2164
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,399
Boxer's face did not reappear at the window.

2165
02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:13,719
Too late, someone thought of racing 
ahead and shutting the five-barred gate;  

2166
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:18,800
but in another moment the van was through 
it and rapidly disappearing down the road.

2167
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:23,560
Boxer was never seen again.

2168
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:27,680
Three days later it was announced that he 
had died in the hospital at Willingdon,  

2169
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:31,241
in spite of receiving every 
attention a horse could have.

2170
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:34,200
Squealer came to announce the news to the others.

2171
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:38,519
He had, he said, been present 
during Boxer's last hours.

2172
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:42,041
"It was the most affecting sight 
I have ever seen!" said Squealer,  

2173
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:45,040
lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear.

2174
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,920
"I was at his bedside at the very last.

2175
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:54,000
And at the end, almost too weak to 
speak, he whispered in my ear that  

2176
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,880
his sole sorrow was to have passed 
on before the windmill was finished.

2177
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:01,720
'Forward, comrades!' he whispered.

2178
02:43:01,720 --> 02:43:04,280
'Forward in the name of the Rebellion.

2179
02:43:04,279 --> 02:43:13,160
Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade 
Napoleon! Napoleon is always right.'

2180
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:16,439
Those were his very last words, comrades."

2181
02:43:16,439 --> 02:43:19,120
Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed.

2182
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:23,400
He fell silent for a moment, and 
his little eyes darted suspicious  

2183
02:43:23,399 --> 02:43:27,799
glances from side to side before he proceeded.

2184
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:29,600
It had come to his knowledge, he said,  

2185
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:35,560
that a foolish and wicked rumour had been 
circulated at the time of Boxer's removal.

2186
02:43:35,560 --> 02:43:40,560
Some of the animals had noticed that the 
van which took Boxer away was marked "Horse  

2187
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:45,920
Slaughterer," and had actually jumped to the 
conclusion that Boxer was being sent to the  

2188
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:51,720
knacker's. It was almost unbelievable, said 
Squealer, that any animal could be so stupid.

2189
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:56,400
Surely, he cried indignantly, whisking 
his tail and skipping from side to side,  

2190
02:43:56,399 --> 02:44:01,359
surely they knew their beloved Leader, 
Comrade Napoleon, better than that?

2191
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:04,080
But the explanation was really very simple.

2192
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:07,960
The van had previously been 
the property of the knacker,  

2193
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:13,480
and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, 
who had not yet painted the old name out.

2194
02:44:13,479 --> 02:44:16,639
That was how the mistake had arisen.

2195
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:19,040
The animals were enormously relieved to hear this.

2196
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:24,240
And when Squealer went on to give further 
graphic details of Boxer's death-bed,  

2197
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:28,639
the admirable care he had received, and the 
expensive medicines for which Napoleon had  

2198
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:33,840
paid without a thought as to the cost, their 
last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that  

2199
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:40,360
they felt for their comrade's death was tempered 
by the thought that at least he had died happy.

2200
02:44:40,359 --> 02:44:42,719
Napoleon himself appeared at 
the meeting on the following  

2201
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:47,760
Sunday morning and pronounced a 
short oration in Boxer's honour.

2202
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:51,760
It had not been possible, he said, to 
bring back their lamented comrade's  

2203
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:56,520
remains for interment on the farm, but he 
had ordered a large wreath to be made from  

2204
02:44:56,520 --> 02:45:02,560
the laurels in the farmhouse garden and 
sent down to be placed on Boxer's grave.

2205
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:09,241
And in a few days' time the pigs intended to 
hold a memorial banquet in Boxer's honour.

2206
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:13,040
Napoleon ended his speech with a 
reminder of Boxer's two favourite  

2207
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:18,960
maxims, "I will work harder" and 
"Comrade Napoleon is always right"  

2208
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:24,920
maxims, he said, which every animal 
would do well to adopt as his own.

2209
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:27,840
On the day appointed for the 
banquet, a grocer's van drove  

2210
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:32,840
up from Willingdon and delivered a 
large wooden crate at the farmhouse.

2211
02:45:32,840 --> 02:45:37,800
That night there was the sound of uproarious 
singing, which was followed by what sounded like  

2212
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:43,880
a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven 
o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass.

2213
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:49,480
No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on 
the following day, and the word went round that  

2214
02:45:49,479 --> 02:45:58,426
from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the 
money to buy themselves another case of whisky.

2215
02:45:58,426 --> 02:45:58,435
CHAPTER X

2216
02:45:58,435 --> 02:46:00,519
TEN YEARS passed.

2217
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:05,560
The seasons came and went, the 
short animal lives fled by.

2218
02:46:05,560 --> 02:46:10,320
A time came when there was no one who 
remembered the old days before the Rebellion,  

2219
02:46:10,319 --> 02:46:16,799
except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the 
raven, and a number of the pigs.

2220
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:21,320
Muriel was dead; Bluebell, 
Jessie, and Pincher were dead.

2221
02:46:21,319 --> 02:46:26,479
Jones too was dead-he had died in an 
inebriates' home in another part of the country.

2222
02:46:26,479 --> 02:46:28,919
Snowball was forgotten.

2223
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:33,279
Boxer was forgotten, except 
by the few who had known him.

2224
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:40,240
Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in 
the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes.

2225
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:47,359
She was two years past the retiring age, but 
in fact no animal had ever actually retired.

2226
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:49,040
The talk of setting aside a corner  

2227
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:54,600
of the pasture for superannuated 
animals had long since been dropped.

2228
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:59,760
Napoleon was now a mature 
boar of twenty-four stone.

2229
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:04,600
Squealer was so fat that he could 
with difficulty see out of his eyes.

2230
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:11,000
Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever, 
except for being a little greyer about the muzzle,  

2231
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:16,240
and, since Boxer's death, more 
morose and taciturn than ever.

2232
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:18,960
There were many more creatures on the farm now,  

2233
02:47:18,960 --> 02:47:23,760
though the increase was not so great 
as had been expected in earlier years.

2234
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:28,160
Many animals had been born to whom the 
Rebellion was only a dim tradition,  

2235
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:32,000
passed on by word of mouth, and 
others had been bought who had  

2236
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:35,800
never heard mention of such 
a thing before their arrival.

2237
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:39,240
The farm possessed three 
horses now besides Clover.

2238
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:45,840
They were fine upstanding beasts, willing 
workers and good comrades, but very stupid.

2239
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:48,840
None of them proved able to learn 
the alphabet beyond the letter B.  

2240
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:54,880
They accepted everything that they were told about 
the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism,  

2241
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:58,880
especially from Clover, for whom 
they had an almost filial respect;  

2242
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:03,359
but it was doubtful whether 
they understood very much of it.

2243
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:07,359
The farm was more prosperous 
now, and better organised:  

2244
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:12,359
it had even been enlarged by two fields 
which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington.

2245
02:48:12,359 --> 02:48:17,920
The windmill had been successfully completed 
at last, and the farm possessed a threshing  

2246
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:23,560
machine and a hay elevator of its own, and 
various new buildings had been added to it.

2247
02:48:23,560 --> 02:48:26,760
Whymper had bought himself a dogcart.

2248
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:31,800
The windmill, however, had not after all 
been used for generating electrical power.

2249
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:37,000
It was used for milling corn, and 
brought in a handsome money profit.

2250
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:40,560
The animals were hard at work 
building yet another windmill;  

2251
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:45,480
when that one was finished, so it was 
said, the dynamos would be installed.

2252
02:48:45,479 --> 02:48:50,919
But the luxuries of which Snowball had once 
taught the animals to dream, the stalls with  

2253
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:57,319
electric light and hot and cold water, and the 
three-day week, were no longer talked about.

2254
02:48:57,319 --> 02:49:02,679
Napoleon had denounced such ideas as 
contrary to the spirit of Animalism.

2255
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:09,440
The truest happiness, he said, lay 
in working hard and living frugally.

2256
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:13,319
Somehow it seemed as though the farm 
had grown richer without making the  

2257
02:49:13,319 --> 02:49:18,719
animals themselves any richer-except, 
of course, for the pigs and the dogs.

2258
02:49:19,399 --> 02:49:24,679
Perhaps this was partly because there 
were so many pigs and so many dogs.

2259
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:29,080
It was not that these creatures 
did not work, after their fashion.

2260
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:31,600
There was, as Squealer was 
never tired of explaining,  

2261
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:35,520
endless work in the supervision 
and organisation of the farm.

2262
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:40,640
Much of this work was of a kind that the 
other animals were too ignorant to understand.

2263
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:45,000
For example, Squealer told them that the 
pigs had to expend enormous labours every  

2264
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:51,399
day upon mysterious things called "files," 
"reports," "minutes," and "memoranda." These  

2265
02:49:51,399 --> 02:49:55,960
were large sheets of paper which had 
to be closely covered with writing,  

2266
02:49:55,960 --> 02:50:00,279
and as soon as they were so covered, 
they were burnt in the furnace.

2267
02:50:00,279 --> 02:50:05,160
This was of the highest importance for 
the welfare of the farm, Squealer said.

2268
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:10,639
But still, neither pigs nor dogs 
produced any food by their own labour;  

2269
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:16,080
and there were very many of them, 
and their appetites were always good.

2270
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:21,559
As for the others, their life, so far 
as they knew, was as it had always been.

2271
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:26,400
They were generally hungry, they slept 
on straw, they drank from the pool,  

2272
02:50:26,399 --> 02:50:33,920
they laboured in the fields; in winter they were 
troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies.

2273
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:37,720
Sometimes the older ones among 
them racked their dim memories  

2274
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:41,400
and tried to determine whether in 
the early days of the Rebellion,  

2275
02:50:41,399 --> 02:50:47,960
when Jones's expulsion was still recent, 
things had been better or worse than now.

2276
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:48,640
They could not remember.

2277
02:50:50,279 --> 02:50:53,800
There was nothing with which they 
could compare their present lives:  

2278
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:57,360
they had nothing to go upon except 
Squealer's lists of figures,  

2279
02:50:57,359 --> 02:51:01,719
which invariably demonstrated that 
everything was getting better and better.

2280
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:04,320
The animals found the problem insoluble;  

2281
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:08,479
in any case, they had little time 
for speculating on such things now.

2282
02:51:08,479 --> 02:51:13,799
Only old Benjamin professed to remember 
every detail of his long life and to  

2283
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:20,880
know that things never had been, nor ever 
could be much better or much worse-hunger,  

2284
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:27,960
hardship, and disappointment being, so 
he said, the unalterable law of life.

2285
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:30,760
And yet the animals never gave up hope.

2286
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:33,120
More, they never lost, even for an instant,  

2287
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:38,319
their sense of honour and privilege 
in being members of Animal Farm.

2288
02:51:38,319 --> 02:51:41,799
They were still the only farm in 
the whole county - in all England!

2289
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:45,279
- owned and operated by animals.

2290
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:48,960
Not one of them, not even the youngest, 
not even the newcomers who had been  

2291
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:54,279
brought from farms ten or twenty miles 
away, ever ceased to marvel at that.

2292
02:51:54,279 --> 02:51:58,960
And when they heard the gun booming and saw 
the green flag fluttering at the masthead,  

2293
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:04,560
their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, 
and the talk turned always towards the old  

2294
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:09,840
heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, 
the writing of the Seven Commandments,  

2295
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:14,360
the great battles in which the 
human invaders had been defeated.

2296
02:52:14,359 --> 02:52:17,599
None of the old dreams had been abandoned.

2297
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:21,760
The Republic of the Animals which 
Major had foretold, when the green  

2298
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:27,360
fields of England should be untrodden 
by human feet, was still believed in.

2299
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:31,239
Some day it was coming: it might not be soon,  

2300
02:52:31,239 --> 02:52:37,719
it might not be with in the lifetime of any 
animal now living, but still it was coming.

2301
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:44,640
Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps 
hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it  

2302
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:50,960
was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, 
though no one would have dared to sing it aloud.

2303
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:55,960
It might be that their lives were hard and 
that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled;  

2304
02:52:55,960 --> 02:53:00,520
but they were conscious that 
they were not as other animals.

2305
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:05,800
If they went hungry, it was not from 
feeding tyrannical human beings;  

2306
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:09,960
if they worked hard, at least 
they worked for themselves.

2307
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:12,760
No creature among them went upon two legs.

2308
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:15,680
No creature called any other creature "Master."

2309
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:18,440
All animals were equal.

2310
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:24,880
One day in early summer Squealer ordered the 
sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece  

2311
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:30,720
of waste ground at the other end of the farm, 
which had become overgrown with birch saplings.

2312
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:35,680
The sheep spent the whole day there browsing 
at the leaves under Squealer's supervision.

2313
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:38,560
In the evening he returned 
to the farmhouse himself,  

2314
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:43,121
but, as it was warm weather, told 
the sheep to stay where they were.

2315
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:45,960
It ended by their remaining 
there for a whole week,  

2316
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:48,439
during which time the other 
animals saw nothing of them.

2317
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:53,081
Squealer was with them for 
the greater part of every day.

2318
02:53:53,080 --> 02:53:59,640
He was, he said, teaching them to sing a 
new song, for which privacy was needed.

2319
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:02,440
It was just after the sheep had 
returned, on a pleasant evening  

2320
02:54:02,439 --> 02:54:07,439
when the animals had finished work and were 
making their way back to the farm buildings,  

2321
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:11,239
that the terrified neighing of 
a horse sounded from the yard.

2322
02:54:11,239 --> 02:54:13,920
Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks.

2323
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,760
It was Clover's voice.

2324
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:21,320
She neighed again, and all the animals broke 
into a gallop and rushed into the yard.

2325
02:54:21,319 --> 02:54:25,080
Then they saw what Clover had seen.

2326
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:30,080
It was a pig walking on his hind legs.

2327
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:33,080
Yes, it was Squealer.

2328
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:39,359
A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to 
supporting his considerable bulk in that position,  

2329
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:44,319
but with perfect balance, he 
was strolling across the yard.

2330
02:54:44,319 --> 02:54:50,599
And a moment later, out from the door of 
the farmhouse came a long file of pigs,  

2331
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:53,840
all walking on their hind legs.

2332
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,920
Some did it better than others, one 
or two were even a trifle unsteady  

2333
02:54:57,920 --> 02:55:01,520
and looked as though they would 
have liked the support of a stick,  

2334
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:06,280
but every one of them made his way 
right round the yard successfully.

2335
02:55:06,279 --> 02:55:10,399
And finally there was a tremendous 
baying of dogs and a shrill crowing  

2336
02:55:10,399 --> 02:55:16,439
from the black cockerel, and out came 
Napoleon himself, majestically upright,  

2337
02:55:16,439 --> 02:55:22,919
casting haughty glances from side to side, 
and with his dogs gambolling round him.

2338
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:26,880
He carried a whip in his trotter.

2339
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:29,359
There was a deadly silence.

2340
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:32,880
Amazed, terrified, huddling together,  

2341
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:38,800
the animals watched the long line 
of pigs march slowly round the yard.

2342
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:43,279
It was as though the world had turned upside-down.

2343
02:55:43,279 --> 02:55:47,679
Then there came a moment when the 
first shock had worn off and when,  

2344
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:51,480
in spite of everything-in spite of their 
terror of the dogs, and of the habit,  

2345
02:55:51,479 --> 02:55:55,160
developed through long years, of 
never complaining, never criticising,  

2346
02:55:55,160 --> 02:56:00,399
no matter what happened-they might 
have uttered some word of protest.

2347
02:56:00,399 --> 02:56:03,639
But just at that moment, as though at a signal,  

2348
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:12,400
all the sheep burst out into a tremendous 
bleating of "Four legs good, two legs better!

2349
02:56:12,399 --> 02:56:17,439
Four legs good, two legs better!

2350
02:56:17,439 --> 02:56:26,399
Four legs good, two legs better!" It went 
on for five minutes without stopping.

2351
02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:31,120
And by the time the sheep had quieted down, 
the chance to utter any protest had passed,  

2352
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:35,319
for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.

2353
02:56:35,319 --> 02:56:38,519
Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder.

2354
02:56:38,520 --> 02:56:39,880
He looked round.

2355
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:41,840
It was Clover.

2356
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:44,640
Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever.

2357
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:48,920
Without saying anything, she tugged 
gently at his mane and led him round  

2358
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:53,440
to the end of the big barn, where 
the Seven Commandments were written.

2359
02:56:53,439 --> 02:56:59,599
For a minute or two they stood gazing at 
the tatted wall with its white lettering.

2360
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:03,440
"My sight is failing," she said finally.

2361
02:57:03,439 --> 02:57:07,799
"Even when I was young I could not 
have read what was written there.

2362
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:12,480
But it appears to me that 
that wall looks different.

2363
02:57:12,479 --> 02:57:18,279
Are the Seven Commandments the 
same as they used to be, Benjamin?"

2364
02:57:18,279 --> 02:57:25,399
For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and 
he read out to her what was written on the wall.

2365
02:57:25,399 --> 02:57:29,719
There was nothing there now 
except a single Commandment.

2366
02:57:29,720 --> 02:57:31,640
It ran:

2367
02:57:31,640 --> 02:57:40,040
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME 
ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS

2368
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:43,120
After that it did not seem 
strange when next day the  

2369
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:48,439
pigs who were supervising the work of the 
farm all carried whips in their trotters.

2370
02:57:48,439 --> 02:57:53,080
It did not seem strange to learn that the 
pigs had bought themselves a wireless set,  

2371
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:55,760
were arranging to install a telephone,  

2372
02:57:55,760 --> 02:58:01,720
and had taken out subscriptions to John 
Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror.

2373
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:06,000
It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen 
strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe  

2374
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:11,960
in his mouth-no, not even when the pigs took 
Mr. Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and  

2375
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:18,520
put them on, Napoleon himself appearing in a black 
coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings,  

2376
02:58:18,520 --> 02:58:21,440
while his favourite sow appeared in the watered  

2377
02:58:21,439 --> 02:58:26,519
silk dress which Mrs. Jones had 
been used to wear on Sundays.

2378
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:31,600
A week later, in the afternoon, a 
number of dogcarts drove up to the farm.

2379
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:36,440
A deputation of neighbouring farmers had 
been invited to make a tour of inspection.

2380
02:58:36,439 --> 02:58:40,040
They were shown all over the farm, 
and expressed great admiration for  

2381
02:58:40,040 --> 02:58:43,279
everything they saw, especially the windmill.

2382
02:58:43,279 --> 02:58:46,319
The animals were weeding the turnip field.

2383
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:51,319
They worked diligently hardly raising 
their faces from the ground, and not  

2384
02:58:51,319 --> 02:58:57,080
knowing whether to be more frightened 
of the pigs or of the human visitors.

2385
02:58:57,080 --> 02:59:02,120
That evening loud laughter and bursts 
of singing came from the farmhouse.

2386
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:08,800
And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled 
voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity.

2387
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:11,760
What could be happening in there, now that for the  

2388
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:17,600
first time animals and human beings 
were meeting on terms of equality?

2389
02:59:17,600 --> 02:59:23,600
With one accord they began to creep as 
quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden.

2390
02:59:23,600 --> 02:59:30,080
At the gate they paused, half frightened 
to go on but Clover led the way in.

2391
02:59:30,080 --> 02:59:32,160
They tiptoed up to the house,  

2392
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:37,519
and such animals as were tall enough 
peered in at the dining-room window.

2393
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:44,960
There, round the long table, sat half a dozen 
farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs,  

2394
02:59:44,960 --> 02:59:48,040
Napoleon himself occupying the seat 
of honour at the head of the table.

2395
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:53,720
The pigs appeared completely at ease in 
their chairs The company had been enjoying  

2396
02:59:53,720 --> 02:59:59,000
a game of cards but had broken off for the 
moment, evidently in order to drink a toast.

2397
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:04,160
A large jug was circulating, and the 
mugs were being refilled with beer.

2398
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:09,359
No one noticed the wondering faces of 
the animals that gazed in at the window.

2399
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:14,200
Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had 
stood up, his mug in his hand.

2400
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:18,160
In a moment, he said, he would ask 
the present company to drink a toast.

2401
03:00:18,160 --> 03:00:23,920
But before doing so, there were a few words 
that he felt it incumbent upon him to say.

2402
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:30,080
It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he 
said-and, he was sure, to all others present-to  

2403
03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:35,800
feel that a long period of mistrust and 
misunderstanding had now come to an end.

2404
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:39,520
There had been a time-not that 
he, or any of the present company,  

2405
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:44,161
had shared such sentiments-but there had 
been a time when the respected proprietors  

2406
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:47,920
of Animal Farm had been regarded, 
he would not say with hostility,  

2407
03:00:48,439 --> 03:00:53,960
but perhaps with a certain measure of 
misgiving, by their human neighbours.

2408
03:00:53,960 --> 03:00:58,960
Unfortunate incidents had occurred, 
mistaken ideas had been current.

2409
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:03,160
It had been felt that the existence 
of a farm owned and operated by pigs  

2410
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:08,920
was somehow abnormal and was liable to have 
an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood.

2411
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:12,399
Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry,  

2412
03:01:12,399 --> 03:01:17,639
that on such a farm a spirit of 
licence and indiscipline would prevail.

2413
03:01:17,640 --> 03:01:23,960
They had been nervous about the effects upon their 
own animals, or even upon their human employees.

2414
03:01:23,960 --> 03:01:26,640
But all such doubts were now dispelled.

2415
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:31,440
Today he and his friends had visited 
Animal Farm and inspected every inch  

2416
03:01:31,439 --> 03:01:34,719
of it with their own eyes, and what did they find?

2417
03:01:34,720 --> 03:01:38,160
Not only the most up-to-date 
methods, but a discipline and  

2418
03:01:38,160 --> 03:01:43,040
an orderliness which should be an 
example to all farmers everywhere.

2419
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:48,040
He believed that he was right in saying 
that the lower animals on Animal Farm  

2420
03:01:48,040 --> 03:01:53,880
did more work and received less 
food than any animals in the county.

2421
03:01:53,880 --> 03:01:58,080
Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors 
today had observed many features  

2422
03:01:58,080 --> 03:02:02,479
which they intended to introduce 
on their own farms immediately.

2423
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:08,599
He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising 
once again the friendly feelings that subsisted,  

2424
03:02:08,600 --> 03:02:12,880
and ought to subsist, between 
Animal Farm and its neighbours.

2425
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:16,080
Between pigs and human beings there was not,  

2426
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:20,800
and there need not be, any 
clash of interests whatever.

2427
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:24,080
Their struggles and their difficulties were one.

2428
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:27,800
Was not the labour problem the same everywhere?

2429
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:32,000
Here it became apparent that Mr. Pilkington 
was about to spring some carefully prepared  

2430
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:37,800
witticism on the company, but for a moment he was 
too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it.

2431
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:43,560
After much choking, during which his various 
chins turned purple, he managed to get it out:  

2432
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:52,081
"If you have your lower animals to contend 
with," he said, "we have our lower classes!"

2433
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:56,160
This bon mot set the table in 
a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once  

2434
03:02:56,160 --> 03:03:00,239
again congratulated the pigs on the 
low rations, the long working hours,  

2435
03:03:00,239 --> 03:03:04,840
and the general absence of pampering 
which he had observed on Animal Farm.

2436
03:03:04,840 --> 03:03:08,120
And now, he said finally, he 
would ask the company to rise  

2437
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:12,239
to their feet and make certain 
that their glasses were full.

2438
03:03:12,239 --> 03:03:15,639
"Gentlemen," concluded Mr. Pilkington, "gentlemen,  

2439
03:03:15,640 --> 03:03:21,240
I give you a toast: To the 
prosperity of Animal Farm!"

2440
03:03:21,239 --> 03:03:24,519
There was enthusiastic 
cheering and stamping of feet.

2441
03:03:24,520 --> 03:03:28,081
Napoleon was so gratified that he 
left his place and came round the  

2442
03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:32,559
table to clink his mug against Mr. 
Pilkington's before emptying it.

2443
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:35,040
When the cheering had died down, Napoleon,  

2444
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:40,840
who had remained on his feet, intimated 
that he too had a few words to say.

2445
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:45,000
Like all of Napoleon's speeches, 
it was short and to the point.

2446
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:49,760
He too, he said, was happy that the 
period of misunderstanding was at an end.

2447
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:53,000
For a long time there had been rumours-circulated,  

2448
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:56,439
he had reason to think, by some 
malignant enemy-that there was  

2449
03:03:56,439 --> 03:04:01,479
something subversive and even revolutionary 
in the outlook of himself and his colleagues.

2450
03:04:01,479 --> 03:04:06,559
They had been credited with attempting to stir up 
rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms.

2451
03:04:06,560 --> 03:04:08,920
Nothing could be further from the truth!

2452
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:12,120
Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live  

2453
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:17,160
at peace and in normal business 
relations with their neighbours.

2454
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:23,000
This farm which he had the honour to control, 
he added, was a co-operative enterprise.

2455
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:29,279
The title-deeds, which were in his own 
possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.

2456
03:04:29,279 --> 03:04:33,359
He did not believe, he said, that any 
of the old suspicions still lingered,  

2457
03:04:33,359 --> 03:04:36,719
but certain changes had been made 
recently in the routine of the  

2458
03:04:36,720 --> 03:04:40,680
farm which should have the effect of 
promoting confidence stiff further.

2459
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:44,240
Hitherto the animals on the 
farm had had a rather foolish  

2460
03:04:44,239 --> 03:04:47,920
custom of addressing one another as "Comrade."

2461
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:50,200
This was to be suppressed.

2462
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:54,239
There had also been a very strange 
custom, whose origin was unknown,  

2463
03:04:54,239 --> 03:05:00,519
of marching every Sunday morning past a boar's 
skull which was nailed to a post in the garden.

2464
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:05,000
This, too, would be suppressed, and 
the skull had already been buried.

2465
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:09,560
His visitors might have observed, too, the 
green flag which flew from the masthead.

2466
03:05:09,560 --> 03:05:12,600
If so, they would perhaps have 
noted that the white hoof and  

2467
03:05:12,600 --> 03:05:16,920
horn with which it had previously 
been marked had now been removed.

2468
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:20,920
It would be a plain green flag from now onwards.

2469
03:05:20,920 --> 03:05:26,680
He had only one criticism, he said, to make of 
Mr. Pilkington's excellent and neighbourly speech.

2470
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:31,600
Mr. Pilkington had referred 
throughout to "Animal Farm."  

2471
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:35,480
He could not of course know-for he, 
Napoleon, was only now for the first  

2472
03:05:35,479 --> 03:05:39,959
time announcing it-that the name 
"Animal Farm" had been abolished.

2473
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:44,800
Henceforward the farm was to be 
known as "The Manor Farm"-which,  

2474
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:47,640
he believed, was its correct and original name.

2475
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:56,360
"Gentlemen," concluded Napoleon, "I will give you 
the same toast as before, but in a different form.

2476
03:05:56,359 --> 03:05:58,880
Fill your glasses to the brim.

2477
03:05:58,880 --> 03:06:05,200
Gentlemen, here is my toast: To 
the prosperity of The Manor Farm!

2478
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:06,040
"

2479
03:06:06,040 --> 03:06:12,000
There was the same hearty cheering as before, 
and the mugs were emptied to the dregs.

2480
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:15,279
But as the animals outside gazed at the scene,  

2481
03:06:15,279 --> 03:06:19,800
it seemed to them that some 
strange thing was happening.

2482
03:06:19,800 --> 03:06:24,520
What was it that had altered in 
the faces of the pigs? Clover's  

2483
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:28,161
old dim eyes flitted from one face to another.

2484
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:33,399
Some of them had five chins, 
some had four, some had three.

2485
03:06:33,399 --> 03:06:38,319
But what was it that seemed 
to be melting and changing?

2486
03:06:38,319 --> 03:06:43,479
Then, the applause having come to an end, 
the company took up their cards and continued  

2487
03:06:43,479 --> 03:06:47,519
the game that had been interrupted, 
and the animals crept silently away.

2488
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:52,600
But they had not gone twenty 
yards when they stopped short.

2489
03:06:52,600 --> 03:06:55,800
An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse.

2490
03:06:55,800 --> 03:06:58,840
They rushed back and looked 
through the window again.

2491
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:01,160
Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress.

2492
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:07,559
There were shoutings, bangings on the table, 
sharp suspicious glances, furious denials.

2493
03:07:07,560 --> 03:07:12,081
The source of the trouble appeared to 
be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington  

2494
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:16,479
had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.

2495
03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:20,919
Twelve voices were shouting in 
anger, and they were all alike.

2496
03:07:20,920 --> 03:07:25,319
No question, now, what had 
happened to the faces of the pigs.

2497
03:07:25,319 --> 03:07:30,920
The creatures outside looked from 
pig to man, and from man to pig,  

2498
03:07:30,920 --> 03:07:47,440
and from pig to man again; but already 
it was impossible to say which was which.
