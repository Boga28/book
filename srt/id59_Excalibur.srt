00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:13,180
CHAPTER ONE
Lady of the Lake

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,180
Merlin closed his eyes and pointed his finger
at another mountain of rocks.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,890
They exploded into a thousand pieces!

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,829
When he opened his eyes, all he could see
was blue sky.

5
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:41,160
Everything round him was empty and silent
- the trees, the hills, the lakes.

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,780
Slowly, a voice reached Merlin's ears.

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:56,530
It was Uther, the King of England, speaking
in his castle miles away.

8
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:03,890
Merlin was a magician with special powers
to see, hear and know all things human.

9
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:14,350
Merlin took a magic crystal ball from the
long, blue robe he always wore.

10
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,880
He wanted to see Uther in the magic ball,
talking to his brother in the castle.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,720
Uther was a strong man who had won many battles.

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,580
Yet England was still divided by many wars.

13
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,799
"I have won enough battles to rule a thousand
countries, yet England stands divided.

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,530
What else must I do?"

15
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,799
Using his magic power again, Merlin shut his
eyes and when he opened them again, he was

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,560
in Uther's castle, hiding behind a wall.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,899
He came out when Uther's brother had gone.

18
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,509
Uther was not surprised to see Merlin as his
magic was respected and feared throughout

19
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,509
the land.

20
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,639
"Merlin, why do you appear now when I wish
to be alone?"

21
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,020
"Because I believe I can help you."

22
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,020
"How?

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,349
No one can stop our people fighting each other."

24
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,830
"Excalibur can."

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,690
Uther was puzzled.

26
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,580
"What is Excalibur?"

27
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,520
Merlin became very serious.

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,110
"Excalibur is the most powerful sword in the
world.

29
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,910
Whoever owns it cannot be killed or lose a
battle."

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,420
"Give it to me!

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,430
I must have it!"

32
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,360
"It is not only mine to give.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,360
The Lady of the Lake must feel that you deserve
it."

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,980
Uther asked to be shown the Lady of the Lake
so he could prove himself to her.

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,860
Merlin agreed.

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,650
He took Uther to a dark valley far from the
kingdom, in which lay a crystal lake.

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,310
Uther and Merlin stood in front of the still
water of the deep lake.

38
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,260
They stared at their reflections in its mirror-like
surface.

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,750
"You must promise me something if I allow
you to take Excalibur from the lake."

40
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,740
"Say it and it is yours."

41
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,440
"I want your first-born child."

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,210
Uther looked at himself in the lake.

43
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:27,270
He saw himself killing men and ruling with
a power that had never been seen before.

44
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,960
Since he had no children, it did not seem
a great deal to ask.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,510
He gave Merlin his word of honour.

46
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,320
The water before them began to stir.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,870
A woman's figure appeared below the surface
of the water.

48
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,240
Her hands rose from the water, holding the
gold handle of the silver sword called Excalibur.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,050
"Take it, Uther.

50
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,260
It is yours if you want it."

51
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,710
Uther stepped into the water, taking the magnificent
sword into his hands.

52
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,970
When he touched it, he was filled with a strange
energy.

53
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,880
He held it up to the sky, admiring the reflections
of light on its silver surface.

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,970
Merlin watched the Lady of the Lake disappear
below the dark mysterious water.

55
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,350
He knew he must watch over the use of Excalibur,
as the Lady of the Lake trusted him.

56
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,670
"You've made a promise Uther.

57
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,570
Do not forget what it is."

58
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,500
Yet Uther had already forgotten.

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,560
All he could think of, as he looked at his
face reflected in the sword, was how strong

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:53,430
and powerful he would become.

61
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:05,100
CHAPTER TWO
Uther's Promise

62
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,790
A few years passed, and in time, the Queen
gave birth to a son.

63
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,190
Uther had completely forgotten his promise
to Merlin until the day Merlin came to claim

64
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,520
what was his.

65
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,740
He entered the chamber where the Queen was
playing with her baby son.

66
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,190
Uther followed behind.

67
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,490
His face was deathly pale.

68
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,240
The Queen saw by her husband's expression
that something terrible had happened.

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
She rose to greet him.

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,760
"What is it Uther?

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,330
You do not look well."

72
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,680
He explained the promise he had made to Merlin.

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,450
Igraine, the Queen, was furious.

74
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,270
"You fool!

75
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,570
You would give up your own child for the price
of a sword?"

76
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,330
Uther turned to Merlin.

77
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,150
"Please Merlin, I beg you, don't take our
child!

78
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,200
I'll give you anything else you ask."

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,370
"You gave me your word of honour.

80
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,990
The child is mine."

81
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,410
And with that, he took the baby from Igraine's
arms.

82
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:20,440
She screamed for the King to take the child
back, but Uther was weak against Merlin's

83
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,020
powers.

84
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,370
Merlin cast a spell over the King and Queen,
which kept them from moving.

85
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,690
When Merlin was gone, the spell went with
him, so the King took Excalibur to the forest

86
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,940
to find Merlin and his son.

87
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,240
Heavy clouds came over the sky, and it began
to rain.

88
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,150
Uther called out for Merlin as he moved through
the forest.

89
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:57,740
The rain, and his wish to see his son, prevented
Uther from seeing the thieves hiding in the

90
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
trees.

91
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,600
A thief jumped on Uther's back.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,970
"Give us the sword and we will let you live."

93
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,320
Uther couldn't reach Excalibur.

94
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,169
He tried to grasp it, but one of the thieves
stabbed him with a knife.

95
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,380
As he fell, he touched Excalibur.

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,380
It gave him the strength to rise and fight,
but he was badly injured.

97
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:27,430
He knew he was going to die, and crawled to
the nearest rock to rest.

98
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,370
The rain poured down on him as he called out
to Merlin.

99
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,370
"Merlin!

100
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,670
I have kept my promise.

101
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,479
I will leave Excalibur in this rock, but you
must make my son a king."

102
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:51,520
Uther rose up with all his strength and pushed
Excalibur into the rock right up to the handle.

103
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,390
The King fell down on the ground and died
next to that rock.

104
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,160
Merlin appeared beside Uther.

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:15,330
"No man shall pull this sword from this rock
unless he is the next king of England."

106
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:24,580
CHAPTER THREE
Arthur

107
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,509
For many years after Uther's death, knights
from all over the country tried to pull Excalibur

108
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,050
from the stone, but none succeeded.

109
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,890
They competed to see who was the strongest
knight.

110
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,460
When these competitions ended, the winner
would go to the rock, with a crowd of people

111
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:52,180
watching, to see if he would be the next king
of England.

112
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:59,620
On one such day a very large man, over six
feet tall, with broad shoulders and long dark

113
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:08,100
hair stepped up to Excalibur to try to lift
it from its resting place of eighteen years.

114
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,680
The country had suffered during these years
as there had never been one ruler to bring

115
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,080
peace to the entire land.

116
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,240
The crowd waited quietly as the tall, dark-haired
man grabbed the handle of Excalibur.

117
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,120
He pulled with all his strength, but the sword
would not move.

118
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,110
The man walked away, disappointed, as a new
round of games began to see who would try

119
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,920
the sword next.

120
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,990
"Arthur!

121
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,120
Where is my sword?

122
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,380
The games are about to begin."

123
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:48,310
Arthur, the slave of a knight called Kay,
was sent to bring Kay's sword for the next

124
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,050
round of games.

125
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,110
Arthur had misplaced Kay's sword, and, in
a panic, he ran trying to find another sword

126
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,680
for his master.

127
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,630
Arthur ran with fear to the rock where Excalibur
stood.

128
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,080
He had never noticed the men trying to pull
the sword from the rock, as he was always

129
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,750
busy serving Kay.

130
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,050
Arthur pulled it from the rock and ran to
his master, happy to have found a sword.

131
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,160
Everyone knew Excalibur from its gold handle
and its silver blade.

132
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,990
Arthur handed it to Kay, who stood admiring
its magnificence.

133
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,990
"Arthur!

134
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,930
Where did you get this?"

135
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,339
"From a rock, just behind the trees."

136
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,839
The crowd around them held their breath.

137
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,410
"The boy.

138
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,000
He's pulled the sword from the rock."

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,670
Arthur became uneasy, not knowing what he
had done.

140
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:53,330
Merlin, in his long blue robe, appeared beside
the boy and placed a hand on his shoulder.

141
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,339
"This boy is the son of Uther, the last king
of England.

142
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,660
He is the heir to the throne."

143
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,750
There was much whispering among the crowd.

144
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,470
No one believed that this servant boy could
be a king.

145
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,680
Only Merlin knew, as he had made Arthur a
servant to teach him what it was like to be

146
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,340
ruled by other men.

147
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,000
He believed that when the time came for Arthur
to be king, he would learn from his master's

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
mistakes and therefore be wiser than his father,
Uther.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,240
Merlin also knew that he had to prove to the
people that Arthur was truly the King's son.

150
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,860
He told Arthur to put Excalibur back into
the rock.

151
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,380
Arthur did.

152
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,700
Merlin asked Kay, and any others who thought
they were worthy of the sword, to try to pull

153
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,779
it out.

154
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:48,960
No one could.

155
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,420
"If this boy, Arthur, pulls the sword from
the rock, he is the true king of England and

156
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,160
you must do as he says."

157
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Arthur pulled Excalibur from the rock and
held it up for all the crowd to see.

158
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,680
The people knelt with respect.

159
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,130
As he held Excalibur, Arthur felt the same
power his father had once felt run through

160
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,130
his body.

161
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,830
"With this sword, I will unite England into
a land of peace and prosperity."

162
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:30,150
With these words, Arthur began to fulfill
his promise.

163
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:43,709
CHAPTER FOUR
Guinevere.

164
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,480
Arthur stood on the wall above his castle's
entrance at Camelot as he watched a woman

165
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,370
riding a horse, accompanied by men in armour,
near the castle.

166
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,350
She was dressed in white, with a green cape
covering her arms and shoulders, and a hood

167
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,440
hiding her face.

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,600
She threw back the hood to announce that she
was Guinevere, princess of Carmelide, daughter

169
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,530
to the baron Leodegran.

170
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:18,139
Arthur, charmed by the lady's beauty - her
red hair, fair skin and clear, green eyes

171
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,660
- didn't know why she had arrived at the castle.

172
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,680
He only nodded to the guards to let her in.

173
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,580
Arthur went to hear what this beautiful woman
had to say.

174
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,910
"Your grace, my father's castle is under attack.

175
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,360
He is loyal to your lordship, and he needs
your help."

176
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
"Guards!

177
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,839
Send our best knights to the castle in Carmelide.

178
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,660
I will soon follow.

179
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,420
Prepare the table and some food for the lady
and her men.

180
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,880
She will stay here until her father is safe."

181
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,269
"I thank you for your kindness, but I must
return to my father.

182
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,900
He is in need of my help."

183
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,730
"Your loyalty to your father equals your beauty.

184
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,120
I promise you, my men and I will protect your
father and keep him safe."

185
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,620
Guinevere thought Arthur had a strong, handsome
face.

186
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:21,520
She liked his quick, thoughtful decisions,
and she agreed to stay.

187
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,430
Arthur rode to Carmelide where he and his
men quickly defeated those who had tried to

188
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,300
overtake the baron's castle.

189
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,620
Baron Leodegran lowered the drawbridge of
the castle for the King.

190
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:48,540
When the two men met, Leodegran knelt before
Arthur, promising his loyalty to the King

191
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,560
and his support of a unified England.

192
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,040
Arthur thanked him, and asked him to return
to Camelot with him and his men to celebrate

193
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,550
their victory.

194
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,910
As they rode to Camelot, Arthur spoke to Leodegran
of his daughter, the princess.

195
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,250
"Guinevere does great honour to your family
name, sir.

196
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,560
I am overcome by her beauty and charm and
I would like to make her my wife."

197
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,530
"No man could wish for more than for his daughter
to marry a king, especially one as noble as

198
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,880
yourself, but I ask you only to speak to Guinevere.

199
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,200
If she is in agreement, then so am I."

200
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,320
They rode on in silence, with Arthur determined
to find a time when he could tell Guinevere

201
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,690
his thoughts.

202
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:40,829
At Camelot, they celebrated with a feast large
enough for two kingdoms.

203
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:45,339
The people danced, and musicians sang of the
battles won and the hope that peace would

204
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,640
soon visit the country.

205
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,850
Arthur had a moment alone with Guinevere,
away from the noise of the celebration.

206
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,420
He told her that he had never seen a beauty
like hers in all his travels through the countryside.

207
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,230
"What is more, your strength of character
goes beyond my idea of a bride.

208
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,040
Will you stand by my side, as my queen?"

209
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,850
He took her hand, and they stood for a moment.

210
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,700
"You have saved my father, therefore you have
saved me.

211
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,880
It would be unwise of me to refuse the hand
of a man who is truly a king,"

212
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:38,440
They kissed, giving those in the castle even
more cause to celebrate.

213
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:46,050
CHAPTER FIVE
Lancelot.

214
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:54,639
Guinevere rode towards Camelot with Arthur's
knights riding in front and behind her.

215
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,079
Her father was at her side.

216
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,670
It was the day of her marriage to Arthur,
and her white dress stood out among the shining

217
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:09,839
silver of the knights' armour and the green
grass on the hills beside them.

218
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,189
They were on a winding road when they turned
a corner and saw a tree on fire.

219
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:24,559
They stopped, left the road, and climbed a
hill to go around the fire.

220
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,290
Enemies of Guinevere's father, Leodegran,
had set the fire, and they were waiting on

221
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:36,470
the opposite side of the hill to attack those
guarding Guinevere.

222
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:43,100
They were led by a man called Maleagant who
once served Leodegran at his castle.

223
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,610
He was in love with Guinevere, but she disliked
him because she did not trust him.

224
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,990
He was also the one who led the attack against
Leodegran which caused Guinevere to ask for

225
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,590
Arthur's help.

226
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,890
As the enemies fought, Guinevere was left
unguarded.

227
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,290
Maleagant saw his opportunity and pulled Guinevere
from her horse onto his own.

228
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,100
She screamed but she could do nothing.

229
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,320
He rode away quickly before any of Arthur's
knights knew what had happened.

230
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:28,840
A horseman stood alone on the opposite hilltop
watching the battle.

231
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,040
He saw Maleagant ride away with Guinevere.

232
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,600
He did not know who Guinevere was when he
rode after them, but his noble character would

233
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,400
not allow him to watch injustice being done.

234
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,150
His name was Lancelot, son of the baron of
Benoic.

235
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,100
His father had been killed in one of the battles
dividing the country, and when he heard Arthur

236
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,390
had pulled Excalibur from the rock, he had
set off for Camelot to offer his help in ending

237
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,070
the wars in England.

238
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,850
Lancelot had to ride quickly to be able to
watch Maleagant and Guinevere, but he was

239
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,090
careful not to be seen.

240
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,190
He wanted to know where Maleagant would take
Guinevere.

241
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,030
Maleagant stopped in a clearing surrounded
by large rocks.

242
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,020
Lancelot hid behind the rocks, so he could
surprise Maleagant.

243
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,620
Maleagant tied Guinevere's hands and feet,
as he wished to rest after the long journey.

244
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:34,760
He stood before Guinevere, staring at her
with the dark, distrustful eyes she had first

245
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,510
seen and disliked in him.

246
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:45,620
"If you do not have what you desire in this
world Guinevere, you must take it, one way

247
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,150
or another."

248
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,530
As he said this, Lancelot appeared on the
rocks above him.

249
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,670
Only Guinevere could see him.

250
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,530
She looked at his kind, brave face and he
assured her with a nod of his head that he

251
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,790
was there for her.

252
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:08,120
"There is a man who is about to change the
world you think you know so well."

253
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,530
"If you mean that tool you wish to call your
husband, you are less intelligent than I thought."

254
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,230
"There are more men than the king who believe
in what is true and just."

255
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:28,980
At that, Lancelot jumped from the rocks above
Maleagant's head and knocked him to the ground.

256
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:36,290
Without a helmet, without knowing where Lancelot
was, Maleagant was dead before he could draw

257
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,309
his sword.

258
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:44,130
"I thank you for saving me, but perhaps there
is one who will be even more thankful.

259
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,500
We were to marry today.

260
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,850
He is the King, Arthur."

261
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,330
"I was on my way to Camelot when I saw what
happened.

262
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,330
I am honoured."

263
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,640
Lancelot knelt before Guinevere.

264
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,730
She was charmed.

265
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,810
"Stand sir.

266
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,440
I am not yet a queen and do not deserve such
honour."

267
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,770
"Yet your beauty alone should have told me
that one day I would serve you."

268
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:14,660
"Tell me your name, and we will ride to Camelot
together, where I'm sure the King will be

269
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,030
as pleased as I am with your feelings."

270
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,370
"My name is Lancelot, son of the baron of
Benoic.

271
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,570
I am at your service."

272
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,770
They rode back together to Camelot where they
were met outside the castle by Arthur and

273
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,250
his men.

274
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,640
When Arthur heard what Guinevere had to say,
he approached Lancelot.

275
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,990
"You have done me a great service, brave sir,
and I wish to do the same for you."

276
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,150
"My only wish is to help your highness unite
this land where men braver than myself have

277
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,929
been killed for no reason."

278
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,400
"Kneel, Lancelot.

279
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,730
From this day forward, you will be Sir Lancelot,
the most favoured knight of the King of England.

280
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,350
Together, we will unite this land."

281
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:05,140
Guinevere watched as Lancelot knelt and Arthur
touched each of Lancelot's shoulders with

282
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,550
Excalibur.

283
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:23,010
She knew that these two men would always be
close to her heart.

284
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:38,030
CHAPTER SIX
Sir Lancelot and Sir Gawain.

285
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,280
After peace came to England and people were
living in harmony, Arthur decided to establish

286
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,799
a symbol of the country's unity which would
help keep the unity and peace they enjoyed.

287
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,100
He invited all the barons of the castles in
England who had remained loyal to the king

288
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:01,330
during his fight for peace to come and sit
at a round table Arthur had specially designed.

289
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,100
At this table, all men's opinions were equal
and matters on how to keep peace and unity

290
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,430
in England were discussed.

291
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:19,510
Sir Lancelot sat to the right of Arthur and
Sir Gawain sat to the left.

292
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:25,870
They were the bravest and most noble of Arthur's
knights, and Arthur put complete trust in

293
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,230
them.

294
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,870
Sir Gawain was jealous of Sir Lancelot.

295
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,240
He knew Lancelot was Arthur's favourite knight
because he had been the first to be knighted

296
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,770
by the King.

297
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,770
Lancelot was said to have a pure heart.

298
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:50,840
He had no ambitions for himself, only for
the King and Queen.

299
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,240
Gawain did not believe this.

300
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,750
He thought Lancelot, like all men, wanted
to be King himself.

301
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:06,720
If Lancelot were King, Gawain thought, he
would have a Queen as beautiful and virtuous

302
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
as Guinevere.

303
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,299
Arthur was called from the castle to visit
Guinevere's father, Leodegran.

304
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:21,270
Arthur asked Lancelot to guard the Queen's
tower while he was gone, as Lancelot was surely

305
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,520
the best swordsman in England.

306
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,419
Sir Gawain gained the trust of one of the
Queen's maids.

307
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:36,390
He asked her to give a letter to the Queen
which he said was from Lancelot.

308
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:42,810
In it, Gawain wrote that Lancelot was in love
with the Queen, and that although Lancelot

309
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:50,000
did not want to betray the King, he would
like to talk to the Queen in private.

310
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,140
The Queen sent for Lancelot the moment she
read the letter.

311
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,270
Lancelot, unwilling to leave his post, was
grateful that Gawain was there to watch the

312
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:04,210
tower while he spoke to Guinevere.

313
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,720
The Queen was very direct with Lancelot.

314
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,460
She asked him to explain the letter.

315
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,130
"Although it is in my name, I'm afraid it
is not by my hand."

316
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,150
"And your heart?"

317
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,740
"My heart is at the service of the King and
Queen."

318
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,940
"Do you love me Sir Lancelot?"

319
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,420
"I love you as my Queen and as the King's
wife."

320
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:32,460
Guinevere was satisfied with Lancelot's answers,
but she was surprised to find that her own

321
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,220
heart was moved by his nobility and grace.

322
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,520
She asked him to sit with her to play a game
of chess.

323
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,440
Lancelot trusted Sir Gawain to keep his post,
at the door of the tower.

324
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,930
The king returned, surprised to see Sir Gawain
at the door of the queen's tower.

325
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,930
"My King.

326
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,660
I saw the door unguarded and so I have been
guarding it myself.

327
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,650
I am sure the Queen is safe, for I have heard
laughter from her chamber."

328
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,370
Sir Gawain couldn't have planned it better.

329
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:13,230
But, as the king arrived at the Queen's chamber,
the Queen and Lancelot had reached for the

330
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,500
same game piece at the same time.

331
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,650
Their hands touched.

332
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,610
Guinevere lightly held Lancelot's fingers.

333
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,610
Lancelot raised her hand with his.

334
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,470
"Will you kiss my hand before you return it?"

335
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,390
"As my Queen, I will..."

336
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,320
Arthur kicked the door open.

337
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,480
Lancelot stood up, reaching for his sword.

338
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,330
Arthur thought he saw them holding hands.

339
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:52,400
The expression of embarrassment on Guinevere's
face gave Arthur more need to worry.

340
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
"You left your post."

341
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,299
"I was called."

342
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:57,299
"Silence!

343
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,169
You left your post.

344
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,049
Now, do as I say and attend to your duties!"

345
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:09,770
The love Arthur felt for Lancelot and Guinevere
hurt him as he was now not sure the love was

346
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:19,190
being returned.

347
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:30,250
CHAPTER SEVEN
Morgan Le Fay.

348
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,360
Merlin would often go to the island of Avalon,
where a young and very beautiful woman practised

349
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,419
the art of magic Merlin had taught her.

350
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:46,679
Her name was Morgan Le Fay, and she could
change herself into any shape, and heal all

351
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,299
illnesses.

352
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,380
Yet this did not satisfy her.

353
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,169
She wanted to cause evil and disharmony in
the world.

354
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:58,880
She thought this would make her truly powerful.

355
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,510
"You are young and foolish, Morgan.

356
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,960
You possess the greatest power there is.

357
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,309
Yet, you want to destroy it."

358
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,670
Morgan begged Merlin to explain how evil is
caused.

359
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,710
He agreed because he wanted her to understand
human pain.

360
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,450
Merlin took out his crystal ball.

361
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:27,180
In it, he showed Morgan what had happened
between Lancelot, Guinevere and Arthur.

362
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,140
"Evil is created by forcing a man, or a woman,
to concentrate on a part of their character

363
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,121
which it is better to forget.

364
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:40,919
You see that man does himself enough harm
without our involvement."

365
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,669
Morgan was not satisfied.

366
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:48,909
Arthur's anger, and the possibility of Lancelot's
desire for Guinevere, lit an evil fire in

367
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:51,020
Morgan's heart.

368
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:59,570
When Merlin left her, Morgan turned herself
into a falcon and flew to Camelot.

369
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:05,120
She circled Camelot until she saw Lancelot
and Gawain riding their horses through the

370
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
forest.

371
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,159
With a strong wind, she blew the leaves on
the forest floor into the air around her,

372
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,159
as she changed forms again.

373
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,740
This time she took the form of Guinevere on
horseback.

374
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:27,549
Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot were stopped by
the wind and leaves which temporarily blinded

375
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,549
them.

376
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:33,320
They sat on their horses, wiping the dust
from their eyes.

377
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,760
Then they saw the beautiful Guinevere riding
towards them through the forest.

378
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,679
Guinevere told Gawain to stay with the horses
and the servants while she led Lancelot by

379
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:51,490
the hand to a clearing some distance away,
but still where Sir Gawain could see them.

380
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,520
She told Lancelot his touch had moved her
so much that she couldn't take a step without

381
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,240
thinking of him.

382
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,580
If he would hold her, if her cheek could touch
his, if he would kiss her, she believed that

383
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:14,320
she would be tree of this desire and could
devote her life again to the King.

384
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,039
Lancelot was torn between his feelings of
loyalty towards the King and an unexpected

385
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,100
desire to take Guinevere in his arms.

386
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:33,169
He thought if he kissed her, just once, he
would satisfy his desire, as well as the Queen's,

387
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:36,799
and then he could remain loyal to the King
forever.

388
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:44,340
They held each other and kissed while Gawain
watched with excited and open eyes.

389
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:50,360
Morgan left Lancelot and the forest as Guinevere.

390
00:30:50,360 --> 00:31:05,590
She flew through the air as an eagle and dived
into the sea as a dolphin.

391
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,070
When she returned to Avalon, she was satisfied.

392
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,840
True power, she felt, was now hers.

393
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,500
Gawain reported to the King what he had seen,
and the King called Lancelot before him.

394
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,140
Lancelot, unable to lie, admitted everything.

395
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:33,039
"Your seat at the round table shall remain
empty as a reminder of your disloyalty and

396
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,039
disgrace.

397
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,840
I banish you from Camelot.

398
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,659
You have betrayed me."

399
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:43,650
Lancelot accepted his punishment as his heart
told him that he had been wrong.

400
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,240
Sir Gawain was pleased with himself.

401
00:31:45,240 --> 00:32:00,370
"Now I will be the King's favourite knight,"
he thought to himself.

402
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:08,390
CHAPTER EIGHT
Mordred.

403
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:16,730
Guinevere could not believe what she heard
when the King told her what Sir Gawain had

404
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,730
seen.

405
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,130
She insisted she had never ridden out to the
forest without her husband.

406
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,210
"Lancelot has admitted to everything.

407
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,210
He has been banished."

408
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,760
"He is lying!

409
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,240
My lips have only touched one man's, and here
he stands before me, willing to listen to

410
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,130
a traitor rather than his own wife."

411
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,890
"But Sir Gawain said..."

412
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,090
"Sir Gawain is a fool.

413
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,429
Look into his eyes and you will see that he
does not know the difference between truth

414
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,429
and fantasy.

415
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,990
Call Lancelot here and we will settle this
matter.

416
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,030
Until then, I will see no one."

417
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,159
With that, the Queen left for her chambers.

418
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,720
The King was alone, thinking, when Merlin
appeared.

419
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,740
Merlin knew that Morgan Le Fay had caused
this trouble, but he also knew Arthur had

420
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,030
made a great mistake.

421
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,659
Not asking Guinevere what had happened showed
a lack of faith.

422
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:21,720
Sending Lancelot away would cause disharmony
in the kingdom and throughout the land.

423
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,740
Merlin told Arthur to call the knights to
the Round Table so he could speak to them.

424
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,299
When the knights were seated around King Arthur,
Merlin stopped at Lancelot's empty seat.

425
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:37,299
"The circle has been broken.

426
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:41,350
Evil, whatever its cause, has touched one
man, therefore it touches you all.

427
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,919
I have seen the future.

428
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,320
England will once again be at war.

429
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,210
There is a truth, which must be discovered
before the country can be united.

430
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,049
It is your duty to find this truth."

431
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:56,430
Merlin rolled his crystal ball across the
table.

432
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:04,530
Gradually, it became a ball of blinding light
until it stopped in the centre of the table.

433
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:09,299
Inside the light, a golden cup with a long
thin stem appeared.

434
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,389
"Observe it, all of you.

435
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,429
It is the Holy Grail, and it holds the secrets
of truth and justice.

436
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,459
Find it, and peace will return to England."

437
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:26,109
Thunder shook the walls of the castle and
it began to rain.

438
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,649
Merlin and the Grail had disappeared.

439
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:33,289
It became dark.

440
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:39,009
Arthur ordered his men to search for the Grail
which would again unite England.

441
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:45,609
He felt the absence of Lancelot as he sat
next to his empty seat, and he too left the

442
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:48,780
Round Table.

443
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,039
Merlin believed he had made a mistake by showing
Morgan the weakness of humans.

444
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:59,069
He returned to Avalon to see if he was right.

445
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:02,380
Morgan was training a small boy to fight like
a warrior.

446
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,609
She had stolen him as a newborn child to raise
him as the new leader of England who would

447
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:11,079
carry out her wishes.

448
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,680
"Morgan, you've disobeyed me.

449
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,030
It must stop."

450
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,030
"Stop?

451
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,420
But do you not see this son of mine, Mordred?

452
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,539
He will one day rule with a power you have
never imagined!"

453
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:33,190
Merlin raised his hand to destroy what he
had helped create in Morgan, but she turned

454
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:39,160
herself into a mirror, and his spell was reflected
back on him, banishing him from the earth

455
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,760
forever.

456
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,660
Morgan turned back into the woman she was,
and looked at her stolen child.

457
00:35:47,660 --> 00:36:01,119
"Mordred, now nothing will come between you
and the throne."

458
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:10,940
CHAPTER NINE
Message.

459
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,660
England now became more divided than it had
ever been, as the round table had broken up.

460
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,999
Violent battles in the countryside divided
the duty of the King's men between searching

461
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:28,359
for the Holy Grail and defending the King's
rule.

462
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,109
Arthur stayed at the castle more often as
he felt there was something missing in this

463
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:36,859
search for the truth the Grail was supposed
to offer.

464
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:41,400
Guinevere went to speak to the King because
she understood his trouble.

465
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,069
"It's Lancelot.

466
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,940
You have acted unfairly.

467
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,829
Until you find him, and peace within yourself,
the country will never be united."

468
00:36:52,829 --> 00:37:00,999
Guinevere's mentioning Lancelot's name filled
Arthur's heart with feelings of guilt.

469
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:06,550
He was so overwhelmed by those feelings that
he was finally able to accept that this was

470
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,170
the truth for him.

471
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,660
"I have also wronged you, my Queen!

472
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,809
I shall ride from the castle and not return
without Lancelot, so that we may be united

473
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:19,079
again in our love for one another."

474
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,270
Arthur called the last of his men together
to ride in search of the most honoured knight

475
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:28,190
in Camelot, Sir Lancelot.

476
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,950
As the men passed a certain tree in a valley,
the tree changed into the form of Morgan Le

477
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,950
Fay.

478
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,900
"Your end is near, Arthur.

479
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,900
My time is just beginning."

480
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:53,880
Morgan rose in the air as an eagle, and she
flew to Avalon to meet her starving son.

481
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,630
Mordred was hungry because he had never met
another human, and his mother filled his head

482
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:04,460
with ideas that he was a great leader whose
men would follow him to the ends of the earth.

483
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,390
His voice was rough and undisciplined, as
he had never spoken with others.

484
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,680
He yelled to the sky as the eagle approached
him.

485
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,069
"I will die if I do not kill and become King!"

486
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:22,880
Morgan landed beside the evil person she had
created.

487
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:30,849
His eyes searched hers like an animal's and
he breathed heavily as she spoke in his ear.

488
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,759
"It is time, Mordred.

489
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,670
You shall be King!

490
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:43,950
Climb onto my back and follow me to your glory!"

491
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:49,849
At that moment, it was no longer Morgan, his
mother, who stood beside him but a large,

492
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,650
shining black horse with wings.

493
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,480
Mordred mounted the animal and let out a sound
like no one - human or beast - had ever made.

494
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:07,170
It shook the whole island and Mordred, on
his horse, flew over the waves to England

495
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:12,519
to claim what he believed was his.

496
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:19,209
Merlin saw all of this, but from a world,
most people would never know.

497
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:23,589
He had banished himself from the earth by
not respecting the art of magic he had been

498
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,269
taught to use wisely.

499
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:30,619
Yet he knew that Morgan could still hear his
voice.

500
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:43,809
He had a message for her, and he was about
to deliver it.

501
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:52,039
CHAPTER TEN
Arthur Fights Mordred.

502
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,480
Two separate forces inhabited the land of
England.

503
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,280
Arthur, in the east, fought and won battles
to reunite the country.

504
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,180
Mordred, in the west, destroyed whatever stood
in his way.

505
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,140
It was the two men's destiny to meet.

506
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,789
Their battle would determine the fate of England.

507
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:25,180
A river separated Arthur and Mordred's men
as they prepared to face each other.

508
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,039
They agreed to fight to the death at dawn,
with the winner taking complete control of

509
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,920
the country.

510
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,859
Mordred fell asleep that night as his mother
was talking to him of his future victory.

511
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:43,809
Arthur slept thinking of not being able to
find Lancelot.

512
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:48,729
Arthur dreamed that he saw Lancelot waiting
for him.

513
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:52,049
Sir Gawain was there watching them.

514
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:58,469
Each time Arthur approached Lancelot, Lancelot
moved away, warning the King that they were

515
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:01,249
being watched.

516
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:04,940
Arthur also saw a woman running.

517
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:11,010
He ran after her, but before he could touch
her dress, she flew up into the air, leaving

518
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,119
him staring at the empty sky.

519
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:20,739
He saw Merlin's face and he woke up terrified.

520
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:26,769
The woman was not Guinevere, he knew it, and
he began to realise that he had been cruelly

521
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:30,979
deceived.

522
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:38,289
Arthur went to where Sir Gawain lay asleep.

523
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:42,049
He woke him, touching him on the chest with
Excalibur.

524
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:47,150
"Sir Gawain, how deep was your jealousy of
Sir Lancelot?"

525
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,309
Sir Gawain could not move.

526
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,989
He was held paralysed by Excalibur's force.

527
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:57,349
"As deep as my love for you, my King!"

528
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:01,630
Arthur lifted the sword and walked to the
river bank.

529
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,900
A strip of golden daylight broke the horizon.

530
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,859
The sun had risen, and Arthur promised to
fight in the name of Sir Lancelot, a knight

531
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:17,329
whose faith and honour he had judged unfairly.

532
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:23,880
Morgan woke in a place where there was no
sun, only clouds of smoke.

533
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,569
She called for Mordred; she ran through the
smoke, only to find herself again in the same

534
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:34,109
spot, surrounded by the same rising smoke.

535
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:38,819
She tried to change herself into something
which would take her away from this awful

536
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,760
place, but she could not.

537
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,069
Her powers had left her.

538
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:48,039
Merlin's voice spoke to her.

539
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:53,910
"Those who do not respect the magic they practise
are condemned to wander worlds where their

540
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,529
powers are useless.

541
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:59,880
I see worlds no man or woman could imagine.

542
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,910
You will see a world no person would want
to."

543
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:14,069
As Merlin's voice faded, Morgan realised that
she was completely alone - forever.

544
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:22,819
She let out a horrible scream into the emptiness
- a scream which only she would hear.

545
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:25,759
Mordred was uneasy without his mother at his
side.

546
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:35,700
Yet his animal instincts and his desire for
blood led him into battle.

547
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:44,160
The fighting was the most violent England
had ever seen.

548
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,920
Knights who once had been united now fought
each other.

549
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,069
Knights on horseback, in the river below,
killed each other without feeling.

550
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:57,289
The river turned red with their blood.

551
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:00,849
Mordred fought his way to the other side of
the river.

552
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:04,160
Arthur had been waiting for him.

553
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,049
When he saw Mordred approach him, snarling
like a dog, Arthur drew Excalibur.

554
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:17,220
They fought, and though Mordred was trained
well, he was no match for King Arthur and

555
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
Excalibur.

556
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:23,380
His true strength had left him when his mother
disappeared.

557
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:30,720
Arthur stood over Mordred's wounded body,
about to put an end to Mordred's evil existence.

558
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,890
As he raised Excalibur above his head, a knight
from the battle approached.

559
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:41,319
It was Lancelot, who had returned to defend
the King.

560
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,890
Arthur stopped and stared.

561
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,200
His heart leapt with joy.

562
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,859
Mordred quickly picked up his sword and wounded
Arthur deeply in his right side.

563
00:44:53,859 --> 00:45:01,279
Arthur took Excalibur and put an end to the
ugly life which was Mordred, before he himself

564
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:04,119
fell to the ground.

565
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:11,770
"My King, it is I who have injured you.

566
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,329
You turned your head for my benefit."

567
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:23,489
"Lancelot, I am dying, but there is no better
sight than you before I do.

568
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:27,349
I ask your forgiveness for not believing in
your loyalty."

569
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,729
"You have it and anything else I can offer
you."

570
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:39,109
"Take Excalibur to a dark valley far away
from the kingdom, far from sight and sound.

571
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:44,410
When you reach the crystal lake that lies
in it, throw the sword in its water.

572
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,690
I was not the King it was meant for."

573
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:54,119
"If that is your wish, it is my command."

574
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,839
Lancelot rode through the night.

575
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:01,999
As the sun rose behind the mountains, which
surrounded the lake he stood before, he threw

576
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:07,309
Excalibur into it with all the strength in
his body.

577
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:12,890
As he watched it fly through the air and into
the lake, his eyes widened as he saw a woman's

578
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:18,059
hand reach out of the water to grab its handle.

579
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:26,589
It held it straight above the water for a
moment, then pulled it fast below.

580
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:33,430
Lancelot understood then that no man in his
lifetime would unite all of England.

581
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,329
He left the lake hoping that one-day one man
would.

582
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:36,369
- THE END -
