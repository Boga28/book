CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,000
The Nursery

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,320
Wendy, John and Michael Darling 
live in a lovely house in London.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
They have got a big, sunny nursery.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,560
There are colourful pictures 
and a big clock on the wall.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
There are toys here and there.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,120
The Darlings are a happy family.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,760
Mr Darling and Mrs Darling 
love their children very much.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:44,320
Wendy is the first child, John is 
the second and Michael is the third.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,760
The children's nanny is called Nana 
and she is a big Newfoundland dog!  

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,360
Her kennel is in the nursery 
and she is a wonderful nanny.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
She loves the children and the children love her.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,680
One evening Mr and Mrs Darling 
want to go to a dinner party.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,160
They have their best clothes on.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,320
'Nana, it's time to put the 
children to bed,' says Mrs Darling.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Nana goes to the bathroom.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
She turns on the hot water for Michael's bath.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
She puts her paw in the water 
to check the temperature.

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,800
It's perfect!

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,080
'I don't want to have a 
bath!' says little Michael.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,560
But Nana is a firm nanny and Michael has his bath.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,320
Then Nana gives the children their pyjamas.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
Now they are ready for bed.

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,840
Mrs Darling comes into the nursery and smiles.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
'Good work, Nana! I see the 
children are ready for bed.'

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Nana wags her big tail.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
Suddenly there is a noise.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,480
Mrs Darling sees a young boy 
outside the nursery window.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,840
She is very surprised.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Nana barks and shuts the window quickly.

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,520
The boy's shadow falls on the floor.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,240
The young boy flies away.

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080
'Who's there?' asks Mrs Darling.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,600
She opens the window and looks 
outside, but she sees nothing.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,200
Then she sees the boy's shadow on the floor 
and says, 'Poor boy, this is his shadow.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
Let's put it in the drawer.'

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,160
The children are in bed.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,600
Mr Darling takes Nana to the garden.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Then he goes to the sitting 
room and waits for Mrs Darling.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
Mrs Darling sings to the children  

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
and kisses them.

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,840
She is a perfect mother.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Soon the three children are sleeping.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
Mr and Mrs Darling go to their bedroom.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,840
They put on their coats 
and go to the dinner party.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
CHAPTER TWO

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
The Shadow

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
The children are sleeping and dreaming.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,840
Suddenly the window opens.

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,400
A small ball of light enters 
the nursery and flies around.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,800
It is a lovely fairy called Tinker Bell.

52
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
She is looking for something.

53
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
After a moment a young boy 
enters the nursery and says,  

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
'Tink, where are you? Please find my shadow.'

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
Tinker Bell finds his shadow in 
the drawer and gives it to him.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,680
'Now I can stick the shadow to my 
feet with some soap,' he thinks.

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
He tries and tries again, but he can't.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,840
He is very confused and starts crying.

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
Wendy wakes up and sees the 
boy but she is not afraid.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,800
His clothes are made of leaves.

61
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,840
'Little boy, why are you crying?' Wendy asks.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
The boy takes off his cap 
and asks, 'What's your name?'

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,280
'Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

64
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
What's yours?'

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,680
'Peter Pan.'

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
'Is that all?'

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
'Yes!' says Peter.

68
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
Then he thinks, 'My name is very, very short.'

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,640
Wendy looks at his shadow and asks, 
'Can I help you with your shadow?'

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
'Yes, please!' says Peter.

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
Wendy gets her sewing basket 
and sews on Peter's shadow.

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,800
After a few minutes she says, 'Finished! 
Now you have your shadow again.'

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
Peter looks at the floor and sees his shadow.

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,840
He is very happy and dances around the room.

75
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
'Oh, Wendy, you are wonderful!' says Peter.

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,760
'Do you really think so?' asks Wendy.

77
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
'Yes,' says Peter.

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,560
Wendy smiles and gives Peter a kiss on the cheek.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,680
'Oh!' says Peter.

80
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
'How nice!'

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,400
'How old are you, Peter?' asks Wendy.

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
'I don't know, but I am young.

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
I don't want to grow up.

84
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
I always want to be a boy and have fun.'

85
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,240
Peter looks around the room for his fairy.

86
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
He hears a noise and looks in a drawer.

87
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
Tinker Bell flies out.

88
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,560
Wendy is delighted to see a 
fairy, but Tinker Bell is afraid.

89
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,840
She hides behind the big clock.

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
'Where do you live, Peter?' asks Wendy.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
'I live in Neverland with 
the Lost Boys,' says Peter.

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,360
'Neverland? The Lost Boys? 
Who are they?' asks Wendy.

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
'The Lost Boys haven't got a mother or father.

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
They are alone in the world 
and they live in Neverland.

95
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,160
I am their Captain.

96
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
In Neverland we fight the pirates.

97
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,440
We also swim in the lagoon 
with the beautiful mermaids.

98
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
Fairies live in the trees in the forest.

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,680
The fairies are my friends,' says Peter.

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,200
'Oh, what fun!' says Wendy.

101
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
'I must go back now.

102
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,840
I must tell the Lost Boys a story.

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,040
They love stories,' says Peter.

104
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,160
'Don't go away! I know a 
lot of stories,' says Wendy.

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
'Then come with me, Wendy.

106
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
You can tell us stories.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
We all want a mother.

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
Please come,' says Peter.

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,200
'But I can't fly,' says Wendy.

110
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,640
'I can teach you to fly,' says Peter.

111
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,920
'Can you teach John and Michael to fly too?'

112
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
'Yes, of course,' says Peter.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,440
'John! Michael! Wake up! This is Peter Pan.

114
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,480
He's from Neverland.

115
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
It's a beautiful place,' says Wendy.

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,480
John and Michael are very surprised.

117
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
'We can go there with him.

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
But first we must learn to fly,' Wendy says.

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,520
Wendy, John and Michael are very excited.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
They try to fly but fall on 
the beds and on the floor.

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,200
'No, no,' says Peter.

122
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,000
'Here is some fairy dust.'

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,480
He puts some fairy dust on their shoulders.

124
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
'Now try again,' says Peter.

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,920
'Look, I can fly!' says Wendy.

126
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,560
'I can too,' says John.

127
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,920
'Me too,' says little Michael.

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,240
'Tink, show us the way to Neverland,' says Peter.

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,360
They follow Tinker Bell and 
fly out of the nursery window.

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
In the garden Nana looks at the sky and barks.

131
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,360
Mr and Mrs Darling return from the dinner party.

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,840
They go into the nursery, but it is empty!

133
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
CHAPTER THREE

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,920
The Neverland

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:11,600
Wendy, John and Michael fly over cities, 
towns, mountains, forests and seas.

136
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
Finally they see an island in the sea below them.

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,840
'Look, that's Neverland,' says Peter.

138
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
'Neverland!' say the children.

139
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,960
In Neverland the Lost Boys live in the 
forest in a secret underground home.

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:41,440
There are six Lost Boys: Slightly Soiled, 
Tootles, Nibs, Curly and the Twins.

141
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
They are waiting for Peter.

142
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,320
Suddenly they hear the voices of the pirates.

143
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
Nibs is very brave.

144
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,040
He goes out, hides behind a 
tree and looks around him.

145
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,400
He sees the horrible pirates.

146
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,800
They are walking in the forest.

147
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
They are big and ugly.

148
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,680
Their pirate ship is the Jolly Roger.

149
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,880
The pirates' captain is James Hook.

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,520
He is a cruel pirate and a very bad man.

151
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,840
He's got black eyes, black hair and a black beard.

152
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
He hates Peter Pan.

153
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
He's only got one arm.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,640
The other is a hook! In the past Peter Pan cut 
off Captain Hook's right arm during a fight.

155
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,680
A crocodile ate the arm.

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,720
Now the crocodile follows Captain Hook 
everywhere because he wants to eat him.

157
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,880
The crocodile has an alarm clock in its stomach!

158
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,560
Captain Hook can always hear it.

159
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
'I know the Lost Boys live in this forest.

160
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
We must find them and Peter 
Pan!' says Captain Hook.

161
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,840
'Tick, tock, tick, tock!' Captain 
Hook hears the alarm clock.

162
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,560
'Oh, no, the crocodile is coming 
to eat me!' says Captain Hook.

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
He runs away and the pirates follow him.

164
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,640
Soon some Indians arrive in the forest.

165
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
They are looking for the pirates.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
The pirates are their enemy.

167
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,720
Tiger Lily is their leader.

168
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,720
She is the beautiful daughter of the Indian chief.

169
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
She loves Peter Pan.

170
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,720
Tinker Bell and Wendy love him too.

171
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,360
The Indians go away and the Lost 
Boys return to play in the forest.

172
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:59,120
Then Nibs looks at the sky and says, 'Look, 
there is a lovely white bird in the sky.'

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,840
'Is it really a bird?' the Lost Boys ask.

174
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Tinker Bell says, 'Yes, yes, it's a bird.

175
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
It's a Wendy bird.

176
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,840
You must shoot it!' Sometimes Tink is a bad fairy.

177
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,000
She knows it is Wendy, but she doesn't like her.

178
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,080
Nibs takes his bow and arrow and shoots Wendy.

179
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,280
Poor Wendy falls to the ground.

180
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,160
The Lost Boys see Wendy and say, 'She's 
not a bird! She's a lovely girl.'

181
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,880
Peter flies down with John and 
Michael and asks, 'Where is Wendy?'

182
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
Tootles says, 'Here she is.'

183
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,680
Peter goes over to her and asks, 'Wendy,  

184
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,280
are you all right?' Wendy slowly 
opens her eyes and smiles.

185
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
'Yes, but I'm very tired,' she says.

186
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
The Lost Boys are sorry.

187
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,600
They decide to build her a little house.

188
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,640
When the house is ready Wendy says, 
'What a lovely little house! Thank you.'

189
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:22,240
'Can you be our mother now? Can you tell us 
bedtime stories before we go to bed?' asks Nibs.

190
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
'Of course,' says Wendy.

191
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,360
'Come in and I can tell you 
the story of Cinderella.'

192
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,640
They enter, sit down and listen to Wendy's story.

193
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
It is a wonderful story.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
Peter Pan is outside the house with his sword.

195
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,840
He wants to protect Wendy and the Lost Boys.

196
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
CHAPTER FOUR

197
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
The Mermaid's Lagoon

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:06,800
One summer evening Peter, Wendy, John, Michael 
and the Lost Boys go to the Mermaid's Lagoon.

199
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,240
Beautiful mermaids live here 
and they are Peter's friends.

200
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,840
They swim and play in the blue lagoon.

201
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,280
Then they sit on Marooner's 
Rock to comb their long hair.

202
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
They sit in the sun and laugh.

203
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,200
The children like the mermaids and 
John says, 'I want to catch one!'  

204
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,280
He tries, but the mermaid jumps into the water.

205
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,640
Peter says, 'It is very 
difficult to catch a mermaid.'

206
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,040
Suddenly someone says, 'Look, 
the pirates are coming!'

207
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,280
A small boat with two pirates 
is coming to the lagoon.

208
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,840
John, Michael and the Lost Boys 
jump off the rock and swim away.

209
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
But Wendy stays with Peter.

210
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
They hide behind the rock.

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
Peter sees Tiger Lily.

212
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
She is sitting in the small boat.

213
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,480
Poor Tiger Lily is a prisoner of the pirates.

214
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
'Let's leave her on this rock.

215
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
When the sea rises, she will die!' says Smee.

216
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
The two pirates laugh.

217
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,440
It is already night and it is very dark.

218
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,720
Peter wants to save Tiger Lily and 
thinks of something intelligent.

219
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,160
He imitates Captain Hook's voice and says,  

220
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,920
'Cut the ropes and let her go! Do as I say, you 
idiots! Let her go!' The two pirates are amazed.

221
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
'Can you hear Hook's voice?' asks Smee.

222
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,240
'Yes, but what do we do?' asks Starkey.

223
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,920
'We must obey him and cut the ropes,' says Smee.

224
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,960
They cut the ropes and Tiger Lily is free.

225
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,760
She quickly jumps into the water and swims away.

226
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,640
Captain Hook sees everything and he is furious.

227
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,640
'That horrid Peter Pan! This 
time I must attack him,' he says.

228
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,280
He swims to the rock and fights with Peter.

229
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
It is a long fight.

230
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,960
The Captain hurts Peter with his 
hook, but Peter fights courageously.

231
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,280
At last, Peter wins the fight and 
Hook swims back to the Jolly Roger.

232
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,880
Peter is now alone on the rock with Wendy.

233
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,960
'The sea is rising and we 
are in great danger here.

234
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,120
We must leave this rock,' says Peter.

235
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,800
'Oh, Peter, I am very tired 
and I cannot swim or fly.'

236
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,920
He sees a big kite with a long tail.

237
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
It is flying slowly over the lagoon.

238
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,560
He takes the tail of the kite and says, 'Wendy, 
hold on to this tail and fly away with the kite.'

239
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,840
Wendy flies away.

240
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,600
'The sea is rising.

241
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,760
I must fly away,' Peter thinks.

242
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:17,840
When he gets home everyone is 
happy to see him especially Wendy.

243
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
CHAPTER FIVE

244
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,640
The Underground Home

245
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,680
The Underground Home is a secret place.

246
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,240
No one knows where it is.

247
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,280
It is a happy, warm place.

248
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,440
There is only one room with a big fireplace.

249
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,560
Tinker Bell has her tiny room too.

250
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
Wendy is a perfect mother.

251
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
She cooks and sews for everyone.

252
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
She also tells beautiful bedtime stories.

253
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,680
The Lost Boys are happy because 
they finally have a mother.

254
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,440
John and Michael are happy because 
there is a new adventure every day.

255
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
Peter Pan is a perfect father.

256
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He brings home food and protects the family.

257
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,840
Wendy and Peter play with the 
children and laugh with them.

258
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,800
But one night something happens.

259
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,560
Wendy tells the children this bedtime story:

260
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
'In the big city of London there are two parents.

261
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,520
They are very sad because they 
cannot find their three children.

262
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,200
Every night they leave the nursery window open.

263
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,520
They wait and wait for their children to return.

264
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,680
But they don't return.

265
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,720
Poor parents! They are very 
sad without their children.'

266
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,080
'Oh, Wendy, this is the story 
of our parents,' says John.

267
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
'Yes, it is,' says Michael.

268
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,840
Peter listens and says, 'Sometimes 
parents forget their children  

269
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
and other children take their place.'

270
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
Wendy is very surprised.

271
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,800
'Oh, no!' she says! 'Perhaps there 
are other children in our beds!  

272
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,680
John, Michael we must go home!'

273
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,640
'Do we really have to?' ask John and Michael.

274
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,840
'Yes, we've got to return home.'

275
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,960
The Lost Boys are sad and say, 
'Oh, Wendy, please don't leave us!'

276
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
'Don't be sad.

277
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,720
You can come and live with 
us in London,' says Wendy.

278
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,800
'Oh, how wonderful!' the Lost Boys say.

279
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,840
'We can have a real family.'

280
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,280
They jump up and down with joy.

281
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,800
They dance around the room.

282
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
But Peter is not happy.

283
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,800
He is very serious and says, 'I'm 
not coming with you to London.

284
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't want to grow up.

285
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
I want to be a boy forever.'

286
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
Everyone says goodbye to Peter.

287
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,800
Outside, the pirates are waiting for them!

288
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,040
The children come out of the underground 
home and the pirates capture them.

289
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Then they take them to the Jolly Roger.

290
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
They don't make any noise.

291
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
Peter doesn't know where they are.

292
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,440
He is sad without Wendy, John, 
Michael and the Lost Boys.

293
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,480
He sits and thinks.

294
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
'Tap, tap, tap!' There is someone at the door.

295
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
'Who is it?' asks Peter.

296
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
He can hear the sound of little 
bells and opens the door.

297
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,640
Tinker Bell flies in and says, 'The pirates  

298
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,000
have got Wendy, John, Michael and 
the Lost Boys! They are in danger.

299
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
Let's help them!'

300
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,440
'I must save them.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,840
Come Tink, let's go to the Jolly 
Roger! This time I must attack Hook!'

302
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,040
CHAPTER SIX

303
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,120
The Jolly Roger

304
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
There is a yellow moon in the night sky.

305
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,920
The folly Roger is in the bay near Kidd's Creek.

306
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,200
The children are on the pirate ship.

307
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,920
They are prisoners of Captain 
Hook and his cruel pirates.

308
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
Captain Hook looks at them and says,  

309
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,960
'This time it's Peter Pan or me! You 
idiots! Peter Pan can't save you now.'

310
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,560
Hook laughs and then calls Smee.

311
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
'Smee, get the plank ready!'

312
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
'Yes sir!' says Smee.

313
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
'Now listen to me,' says Hook.

314
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
'You must all walk the plank!'

315
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
'Walk the plank?' asks John.

316
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,320
'Yes! First you walk the plank and then 
you fall into the sea with the crocodile.

317
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,520
It will eat you! Ha, ha!' laughs Hook.

318
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,920
'But I can save two of you.

319
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,680
I want two young pirates.

320
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,000
Who wants to be a pirate?'

321
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,320
The Lost Boys look at John.

322
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,440
John looks at Michael and says, 
'The life of a pirate is exciting.

323
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
I don't want to walk the plank.

324
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
I don't want to be food for the crocodile.

325
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,240
Let's be pirates!' Michael looks at his brother.

326
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
Then they look at Wendy.

327
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
She doesn't like their idea.

328
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
Captain Hook laughs and moves 
his hook in front of their faces.

329
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,680
'Do you want to be pirates, yes or no?' he asks.

330
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,920
John and Michael say, 'Never!'

331
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,640
Captain Hook is angry and says, 'Then 
you must walk the plank and die!'

332
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,560
Wendy is afraid.

333
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,000
She loves her brothers and the Lost Boys.

334
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
She has tears in her eyes.

335
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,040
The boys stand near the 
plank and Wendy watches them.

336
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,440
A pirate asks, 'Who is the 
first to walk the plank?'

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,459
At that moment there is a loud noise.

338
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:07,040
'Tick! Tock! Tick! Tock!'

339
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,360
Captain Hook's face is white.

340
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,840
He says, 'The crocodile is here.

341
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,400
He wants ME!' He runs to 
his cabin and hides there.

342
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,560
'Who is the first to walk 
the plank?' asks a pirate.

343
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,120
'Come on! Let's go! The crocodile is hungry.'

344
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,720
Suddenly Peter Pan appears on the pirate ship.

345
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
Tinker Bell follows him.

346
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
Wendy and the boys cheer.

347
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,680
They are very happy to see their young hero.

348
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
Hook and his pirates are furious.

349
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,400
Hook takes his sword and says, 'I want 
to fight you, Pan! Tonight you will die!'

350
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,720
Hook fights with his long sword and with his hook.

351
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,200
Peter fights courageously.

352
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
He pushes Hook to the back of the ship.

353
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
It is a terrible fight.

354
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
John, Michael and the Lost Boys fight the pirates.

355
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,520
After a long fight they throw 
the pirates into the sea.

356
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,480
Peter and Hook move all around the big ship.

357
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,280
Their swords make a loud noise.

358
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,640
Suddenly Peter takes Hook's sword 
and pushes him into the sea!  

359
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,360
Hook shouts, 'OH, NO!' He falls into the sea 
and into the mouth of the hungry crocodile.

360
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,920
'Oh, Peter, we are proud of you!' says Wendy.

361
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,360
She kisses him on the cheek.

362
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,840
The boys cheer.

363
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,120
Peter smiles and says, 'The 
Jolly Roger is ours now.

364
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Let's go home!'

365
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
CHAPTER SEVEN

366
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
Home at Last!

367
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,760
At the Darling home, Mr and Mrs 
Darling and Nana are desolate.

368
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,840
They always think about Wendy, John and Michael.

369
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,240
They look at the three empty beds 
and tears come to their eyes.

370
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,680
Mr and Mrs Darling never smile or laugh anymore.

371
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,920
Mrs Darling sits in the silent nursery and cries.

372
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,840
She thinks of her children, their 
games and their happy voices.

373
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
Nana tries to comfort her, but 
nothing can make Mrs Darling happy.

374
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,080
One night after several months 
something incredible happens.

375
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,360
Wendy, John and Michael fly in to the nursery.

376
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,120
Mrs Darling is sitting near the fireplace.

377
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,800
'Mother, Mother we're home!' says Wendy.

378
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,400
Mrs Darling turns around and 
sees her three dear children.

379
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,400
'Is this true or is it a dream? 
I can't believe it!' she says.

380
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,040
'Oh, Mother, we are home 
at last,' the children say.

381
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,360
Wendy, John and Michael embrace 
their mother and kiss her.

382
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,840
'How wonderful to see you, my dear children! 
How wonderful to hear your sweet voices.

383
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,960
Oh, let me look at you!' She calls Mr Darling.

384
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,760
Mr Darling is very happy and surprised.

385
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,280
There is great joy in the Darling nursery tonight.

386
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,720
'Mother,' says Wendy, 'Peter Pan 
and the Lost Boys are here too.

387
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,520
They are waiting outside.'

388
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,480
The six Lost Boys slowly enter the nursery.

389
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,320
They look at Mrs Darling and smile at her.

390
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,760
'Mother, these are the Lost Boys.

391
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,040
They haven't got a mother.

392
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
Can they stay with us?' says Wendy.

393
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,400
'What dear little boys!' says Mrs Darling.

394
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,560
'Of course they can stay with us.

395
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,960
And where is Peter Pan?'

396
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,480
Peter enters the nursery and says, 'I 
am here, but I don't want to stay here.

397
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,040
I don't want to go to school and I don't want 
to grow up! I want to be a young boy forever.

398
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,280
I must return to Neverland.

399
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,000
I am happy with the Indians and the fairies.'

400
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,840
Wendy is surprised and says, 'But 
Peter, when will I see you again?'

401
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,760
Mrs Darling says, 'I have an idea.

402
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,440
Wendy, you can visit Peter in Neverland 
every spring! You can stay there for a week.'

403
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,320
'Can I really go to Neverland 
every spring, Mother?' asks Wendy.

404
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
Peter looks at Mrs Darling 
and asks, 'Is that a promise?'

405
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
'Of course it is,' says Mrs Darling.

406
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
'Then I want spring to come quickly,' says Peter.

407
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,040
'Yes, very quickly,' says Wendy.

408
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,680
'Come on, Tink! Let's fly home 
and wait for spring,' says Peter.

409
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,760
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell fly out of 
the nursery window into the night sky.

410
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,840
Their destination?

411
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:43,840
Neverland!
