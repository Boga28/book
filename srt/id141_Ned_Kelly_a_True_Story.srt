1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
IT IS THE YEAR 1880.

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,777
In the prison in Melbourne, Australia, a young 
man has visitors - his mother, a brother, and  

3
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:01,321
two sisters. Nobody is saying very much. There is 
only one word to say, and the word is 'Goodbye'.

4
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:01,521
Because the young man is Ned Kelly,  

5
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:02,032
the most famous outlaw in all Australia. And 
tomorrow morning the prison officers are going  

6
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:02,382
to put a rope around his neck 
and hang him until he is dead.
 
 

7
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:02,560
This is Ned Kelly's story...
 
 
 

8
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,200
CHAPTER ONE

9
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,200
Ned's Young Days
 

10
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,120
JULY, 1865. The story begins in Avenel, 
a small town north of Melbourne.  

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,120
Ned Kelly lives here with his 
parents, John and Ellen Kelly.  

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,720
Ned is ten years old, the oldest 
boy of the seven Kelly children.  

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:43,840
He has two brothers, Jim and Dan, and four 
sisters - Anne, Maggie, Kate, and Grace.
 
 

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
***

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,400
'Where's your father, boy?' Ellen Kelly called 
out to her son one evening. 'Is he on the road?  

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,840
Can you see him?'

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,600
Ned Kelly looked out of the door. 
'No, Ma,' he said. 'I can't see him.'

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,400
Ned's father came home late, 
and he came in quietly.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,680
'Ellen,' he said, 'come with me. I need your 
help. There's a dead cow by the trees on the hill.  

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,120
We must cut it up and bring it home.'

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,320
'Oh, John, is it one of our cows?' 
his wife asked. 'How did it die?'

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
'It's one of Morgan's cows, and I killed it,'  

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,560
John said. 'So we must be quick, 
before he comes looking for it.'

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
'Oh, you fool!' said Ellen.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,080
In the children's bed in the next room, 
Ned listened to this. It was a small house,  

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,080
with only two rooms, and you could hear 
everything. Ned was pleased about the dead cow.  

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,800
They didn't often have meat to eat, 
and the children were always hungry.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,520
But dead cows bring trouble. Three days 
later there was a policeman at the door.  

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:35,840
'John Kelly, you killed Morgan's 
cow, and I'm taking you to prison...'

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,400
That was the end of school for Ned 
Kelly. He was the man of the family now.  

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,000
He helped his mother, and he worked on the 
Kellys' farm. The farm was not very big,  

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
and life was not easy for the Kellys.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,720
John Kelly and Ellen Quinn were from Ireland. 
They first met in Melbourne, and then came north,  

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,960
to find land for a farm. Many other 
Irish people did the same thing.  

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Everybody wanted land, but some people 
had a lot more land than other people.  

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,840
It was a hard, wild life. There was 
a lot of drinking, a lot of fighting,  

37
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,240
a lot of stealing - horses, cows, dead or alive...

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:49,120
John Kelly was in prison for six months. Prison 
was not good for him, and when he came out,  

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
he began to drink. A year 
and a half later he was dead.

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
'What are we going to do now, Ma?' Ned asked.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,800
Ellen thought about it. She was a 
tall, strong woman, and all her life  

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,000
she was a fighter. She had twelve children in the 
end and was ninety-three years old when she died.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,640
'We must leave here,' she said. 'We must go 
to the northeast, and live near my family.'

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
***

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,360
The Kellys' new house was at Eleven Mile Creek, 
near Greta. They had some animals and a small  

46
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,560
garden, and Ned worked hard 
to get money for the family.  

47
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,680
He could do farming work, take care 
of horses and cows, cut down trees.

48
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,320
But trouble was never far away.  

49
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:09,680
The police did not like the wild Kelly boys, or 
their friends. In 1870, when Ned was fifteen,  

50
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,680
he hit a man very hard in a fight, and the 
police put him in prison for six months.

51
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,840
The next year something worse happened.  

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,000
Ned was in the town of Greta on a brown 
horse when Policeman Hall came up to him.

53
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,400
'Ned Kelly, you get down and come with me. You 
stole that horse and I'm taking you to prison.'

54
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,720
'That's not true,' said Ned, and 
then there was a terrible fight.  

55
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,320
Policeman Hall had a gun and Ned did 
not, but Ned was the better fighter.  

56
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,640
In the end Hall called for help 
and five men came to help him.

57
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,280
Next day they took Ned down to Wangaratta 
and he went in front of the judge.

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,480
'It's not my horse, it belongs to a man 
called Wild Wright,' Ned told the judge.  

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
'Wright was at my mother's 
house, and his horse ran away.  

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:35,280
He needed a horse so I gave him one of my horses. 
And he said to me, "When you find the brown horse,  

61
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,680
you keep her for me." And so when 
I found the horse, I kept her.'

62
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
'Ned Kelly stole that horse!' Policeman Hall said.  

63
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,600
'It belongs to a man in Mansfield, and 
someone stole it on the 6th of March.'

64
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:03,280
'Well,' Ned said, 'I was in Beechworth prison up 
to the 29th of March. How can I steal a horse when  

65
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,280
I'm in prison? And Wright told me it was his 
horse - I didn't know it was a stolen horse.'

66
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,400
But it is a crime to have a stolen horse. 
Wild Wright, of course, stole the horse,  

67
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:30,160
and he went to prison for eighteen months. But 
they put Ned Kelly in prison for three years.  

68
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:43,840
When he came back to Eleven Mile Creek 
in 1874, things were very different.
 
 
 

69
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
CHAPTER TWO

70
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,080
The Kelly Gang
 

71
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:13,600
MAY, 1874. Neds sister Annie is dead; his brother 
Jim is in prison (five years for stealing cows),  

72
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,440
and his brother Dan is often in trouble too.  

73
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,840
There are new faces at home - a new 
husband, and a new baby, for Neds mother.
 
 

74
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
***

75
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,240
'Ned? Is that you? Oh, Ned!' 
Ellen Kelly ran to the door.  

76
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:44,720
Ned, now nineteen years old, tall and strong, was 
home from prison. He put his arm round his mother.

77
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
'Hello, Ma,' he said.

78
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
'Oh, Ned, it's good to see you,' said Ellen.

79
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,160
'I heard about Jim,' Ned said. 'And little Annie.'

80
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,840
'Poor, poor Annie,' said his mother. 
'She was so ill after she had the baby,  

81
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,120
and we couldn't do anything to help 
her. And poor Jim got five years!'

82
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,360
'Yes, that's hard,' said Ned. 'And what about 
you, Ma? I hear you've got a new husband.'  

83
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,760
He looked at the sleeping 
baby in his mother's arms.

84
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,120
'He's a good man, Ned. Little 
Ellen here - she's his daughter.'

85
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,840
Ned touched the baby's little hand.

86
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,520
'I'm happy for you, Ma. And I'm happy to be back.'

87
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
***

88
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,920
Ned soon found work. He moved from farm to farm, 
cutting down trees and helping with the horses  

89
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,920
and cows. He often came home to see his mother, 
and he and George King, Ellen's new husband,  

90
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,960
were soon friends. George was from California, 
and was only five years older than Ned.

91
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,040
On one visit home, Ned talked to George  

92
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,000
about the police. 'Why do they 
give me all this trouble?' he said.

93
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,520
'I don't know,' said George. 
'They just don't like you.'

94
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,320
'It's true,' Ned said. 'When somebody loses a 
cow or a horse, the police always come to me  

95
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:45,360
with their questions. Then they go to my mother's 
house and ask her questions. And they always go  

96
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,160
late at night, when you're 
all in bed. It isn't right.'

97
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,080
'Well, come and work with me,' said George.  

98
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,400
'Why not? You're good with horses, and I 
don't have any trouble with the police.'

99
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,920
'What work are you planning to do?' said Ned.

100
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,240
'Sell horses - lots of them.'

101
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,040
'And where are you going to get all 
these horses from, George?' asked Ned.

102
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
George smiled. And Ned laughed.

103
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
***

104
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:37,040
It was exciting work. 'We stole 280 
horses,' Ned said later. 'Then we  

105
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,280
took them across the Murray River and sold 
them in New South Wales for a lot of money.'

106
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,000
The police got angrier and angrier. 
They couldn't stop the stealing,  

107
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,680
and they couldn't catch Ned Kelly or 
George King with the stolen horses.

108
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:11,040
In August 1877 a new policeman came to Benalla. 
Alex Fitzpatrick liked horses, girls, and drink,  

109
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,640
and for some weeks he and Ned were friends.  

110
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:24,640
Ned's sister Kate was a beautiful girl with long 
black hair. She liked Fitzpatrick too, at first.  

111
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,640
But soon there were angry words 
between him and Ned, and then a fight.  

112
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,400
A policeman could not be a 
friend of the Kellys for long.

113
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:50,960
April 1878 came. The police had questions about 
stolen horses for Dan, and for Ned's best friend,  

114
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:02,400
Joe Byrne. So Fitzpatrick rode out to the Kellys' 
house, to find Dan. Perhaps he wanted to see Kate  

115
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:11,600
too - but did Kate want to see him? On his way 
there he stopped and had two or three drinks.  

116
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,840
When he arrived at the house, 
he felt very strong and brave.

117
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,880
'Dan Kelly, you're coming with me 
to the police station,' he said.

118
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,840
'I'm having my dinner,' said Dan. 'You can wait.'

119
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,800
Fitzpatrick sat at the table, waiting 
for Dan, but his eyes were on Kate  

120
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:53,200
all the time - on her long black hair, on her 
beautiful body. The small room felt very hot.

121
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,200
Then Kate walked past the table, very 
near him, and he put his arm around her.

122
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,360
'You're a beautiful girl, 
Kate,' he said. 'Let's -'

123
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,840
'Take your hands off me!' said Kate.

124
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,280
Suddenly Ned was at the door,  

125
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,120
with a gun in his hand. He fired at 
Fitzpatrick and hit him in the wrist.

126
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,400
'Get out!' said Ned. 'Get away from my sister!'

127
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Fitzpatrick ran out of the house and 
rode through the night back to Benalla.

128
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,640
The next morning there were 
ten policemen at the door.  

129
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,040
They found Ellen at home, but not Ned or Dan.

130
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,720
'Ellen Kelly,' they said. 'You and your 
sons tried to kill Policeman Fitzpatrick.'

131
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
'Nobody tried to kill Fitzpatrick!' said Ellen.  

132
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,760
'You just want to make trouble for me and 
my family.' She had a new baby in her arms,  

133
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,320
her third child by George King. But 
George did not live with Ellen now.

134
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,640
'Mrs Kelly, where are your 
sons?' said a policeman.

135
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Ellen looked into the policeman's eyes.  

136
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,640
'I don't know,' she said. 'You 
want them, you go and find them.'

137
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
***

138
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,680
When Ned and Dan left their mother's house that 
night, they rode away into the Wombat Hills.  

139
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,480
At Bullock Creek, miles from 
anywhere, they built a small hut.  

140
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,680
They lived wild, and looked for gold in the river.

141
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,640
Joe Byrne, Ned's good friend, went with them, 
because he needed to hide from the police too.  

142
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,600
And in June, three months later, 
Steve Hart, another good friend,  

143
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:28,000
came out of prison. He, too, got on his horse and 
rode to Bullock Creek. So there were four of them.

144
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:39,200
Then, in October, Ellen's brother came 
to find them, with some terrible news.

145
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,200
'Your mother's going to 
prison, Ned. For three years.  

146
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,040
Because she and you and Dan tried 
to kill Fitzpatrick, the judge said.  

147
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:04,160
And the police are looking for you and 
Dan. Be careful, boys - stay in the hills!'

148
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,360
For a second Ned's eyes were red like 
fire. He spoke slowly and coldly.

149
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,800
'They can look,' he said, 'but 
they can't catch me out here.'  

150
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,800
He looked at his brother Dan 
and his friends Joe and Steve.  

151
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:36,800
'These policemen, these judges - they're 
worse than dogs! They put my mother in prison,  

152
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,200
and what did she do? Nothing! 
From now on, we're the Kelly gang.  

153
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,120
We're free men - and we're staying 
that way. Are you with me, boys?'

154
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,840
And that was the beginning of the Kelly Gang.
 
 
 

155
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,600
CHAPTER THREE

156
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,520
Three Dead Men
 

157
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:33,520
OCTOBER, 1878. Four policemen ride north from the 
town of Mansfield, Kennedy, McIntyre, Lonigan,  

158
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,640
and Scanlon are on their way to Stringybark 
Creek in the Wombat Hills. They plan to camp  

159
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,160
there for a week, look for the Kelly Gang - and 
bring them back to Mansfield, dead or alive.
 
 

160
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
***

161
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:59,280
Very early one morning Ned and Dan left 
Bullock Creek. Joe and Steve waited at the hut.

162
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,240
'Walk quietly, Dan,' said Ned,  

163
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,840
'and listen. I saw horses' tracks near here 
yesterday, and I think the police are after us.'

164
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,240
The police camp at Stringybark Creek was only two 
kilometres away, and the brothers soon found it.  

165
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,800
They hid behind the trees and watched.  

166
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:38,160
They saw the four policemen, and their guns 
- two big heavy guns and four smaller guns.

167
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,720
Later, back at Bullock Creek, Joe and 
Steve listened to the news about the guns.

168
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,400
'We've only got two guns. 
What can we do?' said Joe.

169
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,760
'They want to kill us,' said Dan. 'They're 
going to shoot to kill. Isn't that right, Ned?'

170
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:10,640
'Yes, that's right,' said Ned. 'So, 
we can stay here and wait for them -  

171
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,720
or we can go down there and take their 
guns and horses. What do you say?'

172
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,000
It was an easy answer. The Kelly 
Gang got ready, left Bullock Creek,  

173
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
and went quietly through the trees.

174
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,200
When they arrived at the police camp, only 
Lonigan and McIntyre were there. Lonigan  

175
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,600
sat on a tree, reading a newspaper, 
and McIntyre watched the camp fire.  

176
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,680
Then, from behind a tree, Ned Kelly called out.

177
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
'Put your hands up!'

178
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:07,440
McIntyre had no gun, so he sat still and 
put his hands up, but Lonigan ran. Then  

179
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:16,320
he got down behind a fallen tree, 
took out his gun, and put his head up.

180
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:24,160
He was a fool. A bullet from Ned's gun 
hit him in the head, and he died at once.

181
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,880
Ned ran to McIntyre. 'Don't move!' 
he said. 'We don't want to kill you,  

182
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
we just want the guns and horses.'

183
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,640
But before the gang could find the guns 
and leave, they heard a noise in the trees.

184
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,520
'Ned!' called Steve. 'The other 
two policemen are coming back!'

185
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:01,520
'Sit on this tree,' Ned said to McIntyre. 'And 
when you see your friends, call out to them.  

186
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:11,840
Say, "Don't shoot - put your guns on the 
ground." We don't want to kill them, or you.'

187
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:22,080
Seconds later, Kennedy and Scanlon rode 
into the camp. McIntyre stood up and said,  

188
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
'Get off your horses and put your hands 
up - there are men with guns here.'

189
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,360
'Oh yes?' said Kennedy. He laughed 
at McIntyre. 'What men? What guns?'

190
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,720
At once the Kelly Gang came out of the 
trees and Ned called, 'Put your hands up!'

191
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:58,240
Everything happened very quickly. A bullet from 
Ned's gun hit Scanlon, and he fell from his horse.  

192
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:10,080
Kennedy jumped off his horse and fired at Dan. Dan 
fired back, and Kennedy ran back into the trees.

193
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,560
McIntyre could not shoot because 
he did not have his gun with him.  

194
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,560
But there in front of him was Kennedy's horse. 
He jumped on it and rode into the trees.

195
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:33,520
Kennedy tried to get away too. He went 
quietly through the trees, but suddenly  

196
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:44,000
he saw Ned in front of him. The two men fired 
- and Kennedy fell down. Soon he was dead.

197
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
'He was a brave man, but it was him or me,'  

198
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,440
said Ned. 'I didn't want to do it. 
I didn't want to kill any of them.'

199
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,320
The gang put coats over the three dead bodies, 
took the horses, guns and food, and rode away.

200
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:17,840
'They came to kill us, boys,' said Ned, 
'but we killed them. What could we do?  

201
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,720
Now we must go - and we're not coming back.'

202
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,840
The Kelly Gang rode away to the north.

203
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,480
***

204
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:42,640
The next day, tired and dirty, McIntyre arrived 
back in Mansfield. Soon every town and village and  

205
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,080
farm in the north-east knew about the killing 
of the three policemen at Stringybark Creek.

206
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,520
'The Kelly Gang are killers,' said 
the police. 'These men are now  

207
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:05,600
outlaws, and we must catch them, dead or alive. 
When you see them, tell us. We are giving 500  

208
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:13,840
pounds reward for news of every man in the 
gang - 2000 pounds for all four of them.'

209
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:22,400
It was a lot of money. More policemen came to 
the north-east, with more guns, more horses.

210
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Ned and the gang stayed in the north-east. 
They tried to get away to the north,  

211
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,760
but there was a lot of water in the Murray 
River, and they couldn't get across it.  

212
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:45,200
They got help from their friends and moved 
from place to place all the time. One week  

213
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,920
they rode more than three hundred kilometres.

214
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:58,000
Thirty policemen rode through the hills for a 
month and looked for the outlaws night and day.  

215
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:07,120
But they never found them, and in December 
Ned and the gang moved on to the Warby Hills.  

216
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:23,840
It was a hard, wild life, and the outlaws 
were tired, hungry, and angry men.
 
 
 

217
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,960
CHAPTER FOUR

218
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Two Visits to the Bank
 

219
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:51,040
DECEMBER, 1878. The Kelly Gang have many friends, 
but they have no money. So they rob the bank in  

220
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:58,320
the little town of Euroa. They speak nicely to the 
people in the town, and do not fire their guns.  

221
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:08,400
They leave Euroa with 2260 pounds. But they 
give a lot of the money to their friends,  

222
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,920
the poor farmers of the north-east, 
to buy food, clothes, and land.  

223
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,840
The police reward goes up to 2500 pounds.
 
 

224
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
***

225
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,880
The police tried hard to catch the Kelly Gang, 
but the outlaws had help from their friends.  

226
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,240
They were always miles away when 
the police came to look for them.  

227
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
So the police put many of their friends in prison.

228
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:50,800
Ned was very angry about this. 'It isn't right!' 
he said. 'Why do the police do this? Because our  

229
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:58,480
friends are poor farmers, not rich ones, and 
because they help us. We must stop the police!'

230
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,240
'But how?' said Steve. 'What can we do?'

231
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:16,160
'Two things,' said Ned. 'First, we need more 
money, so we must visit a bank. And second,  

232
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
we tell everybody in Australia 
about the police here in Victoria.'

233
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,080
'Rob another bank?' Dan said. 'But the 
police are watching all the banks now.'

234
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,040
'Yes, in Victoria,' said Ned. 'But not in 
New South Wales, so we're going to a bank  

235
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,840
in Jerilderie. Here's the plan. There 
are only two policemen in Jerilderie.  

236
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,600
We arrive at night, go to the police station, 
and lock the policemen in the station. Then  

237
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,160
we rob the bank, and go to the 
office of Jerilderie's newspaper.'

238
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,040
'The newspaper office?' said Dan. 'Why? What for?'

239
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:13,520
'To print this,' said Joe. 'Look. It's Ned's 
letter to the world. I wrote it down for him.  

240
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,280
It tells the true story about Ned and his family,  

241
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,400
about the police, about Stringybark 
Creek, about everything.'

242
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,360
'We want everybody to read this 
letter, but how do we give it to them?'  

243
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,800
Ned said. 'We must print it in 
a newspaper. It's the only way.'

244
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
***

245
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Ned planned the Jerilderie visit very carefully.  

246
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,720
There were now more than two hundred 
policemen in the north-east of Victoria  

247
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,840
because of the Kelly Gang, and Ned asked 
his friend Aaron Sherritt for help.

248
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
So Aaron went drinking with a policeman.  

249
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Money passed from one hand to another, and 
Aaron spoke quietly in the policeman's ear.

250
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,960
'Go to Corryong. The gang are planning to 
cross the Murray River near there very soon.'

251
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,760
So the police rode east to Corryong 
- and the Kelly Gang rode west,  

252
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,120
and crossed the river two hundred kilometres away.  

253
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:38,240
And late on a Saturday night in February 
1879, they rode into the town of Jerilderie.

254
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Outside the police station Ned began to shout,  

255
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,840
'Help! Help! There's a big fight 
at the hotel! We need help!'

256
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,200
The two policemen ran out - and 
saw the outlaws with their guns.  

257
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,160
The gang locked the policemen in a room 
in the station, and took their uniforms.

258
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:12,880
For the next two days the gang lived 
in the police station. On Sunday  

259
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,480
Joe and Steve put on the police 
uniforms and walked around the town.  

260
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,440
'We're the new policemen for Jerilderie,' 
they told everyone. They went past the  

261
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,840
bank and the hotel next to it, and looked 
carefully at all the doors, front and back.

262
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,800
Then, on Monday morning Dan and Steve 
went into the hotel next to the bank,  

263
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,520
and took out their guns. They took 
all the hotel workers into one room.

264
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:01,120
'Don't move,' said Dan. 'You're our hostages, but 
don't be afraid. We don't want to shoot anybody.'

265
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,960
Ned and Joe went into the 
bank through the back door.  

266
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,600
When they came back to the hotel, 
they had more hostages - two bank  

267
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:23,680
workers and all the people from the bank. 
And Ned had the bank's money - 2140 pounds.

268
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,840
There were now about sixty hostages in 
the room, and Ned began to speak to them.

269
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:46,960
'What's happening in this country? Do you know? 
No, you don't! So listen! Poor men get poorer,  

270
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:56,960
and rich men get richer. The police help the 
rich farmers, and put the poor farmers in prison.  

271
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:09,840
Why? For nothing! Do you call this 
justice? There is no justice in Australia!

272
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,400
'The police say we are killers. 
But I say the police are killers!  

273
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm going to tell you about Stringybark Creek 
- the true story, not the police story.'

274
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,680
Ned began to read to the hostages from his letter.  

275
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:49,520
It was a long letter, 56 pages and more than 
75,000 words. After a few pages he stopped.

276
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,680
'Where's the newspaper office in this town?'  

277
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,920
he said. 'I want to print this 
letter. Then everybody can read it.'

278
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,880
Edwin Living, one of the bank workers, answered.

279
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,400
'Mr Gill is the editor of the newspaper,' he 
said. 'I know his house. I can take you there.'

280
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,840
'Come on, then,' Ned said.

281
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:29,040
But Mr Gill was not at home. He was 
at a farm ten kilometres away. When  

282
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,040
he heard the Kelly Gang were in town, he 
ran away, because he was afraid of them.

283
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,320
At the house Mrs Gill opened the door.

284
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,960
'Where's your husband?' Ned asked.

285
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,560
'I - I don't know. He's - 
he's away,' Mrs Gill said.

286
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,280
Ned looked at her angrily, 
and took out his letter.  

287
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,320
'I want him to print this 
in his newspaper,' he said.

288
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,920
'Give it to me,' said Edwin Living. 'I 
can give it to Mr Gill when he gets back.'

289
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,560
'He must print it,' said Ned. 'It's about 
my life, and I want the world to read it.'

290
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:29,840
'Yes,' said Edwin. 'Everybody must read it. And 
Mr Gill's going to print it - for sure, Mr Kelly.'

291
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
'He must,' Ned said.  

292
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,880
'All right, you give it to him. But do it! 
Or the next time I come to Jerilderie...'

293
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:55,120
They went back to the hotel, and Ned had a drink 
with the hostages. Then the four outlaws rode out  

294
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:02,320
of town, back to the Murray River, and across 
into Victoria and the hills in the north-east.

295
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
***

296
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:13,440
The police looked everywhere. They made the 
reward 8,000 pounds, but nobody came to get it.  

297
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,240
Nobody wanted to help them. In Jerilderie, 
people laughed about the visit of the Kelly Gang.  

298
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:32,160
In April, Ned's friends came out of prison and 
went back to their farms. And for sixteen months,  

299
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,280
the police heard nothing of the Kelly Gang.

300
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,440
And Ned's letter - the famous 'Jerilderie Letter'?

301
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:53,840
Edwin Living did not give it to Mr Gill. He went 
down to Melbourne and gave it to the police.

302
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:07,840
Nobody saw the letter again for fifty years.
 
 
 

303
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,040
CHAPTER FIVE

304
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,320
Alive or Dead at Glenrowan
 

305
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:31,280
JUNE, 1880. The Kelly Gang are living in the 
hills. Their friends bring them food, but life  

306
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,880
is hard, and the police are still making trouble. 
They don't put the Kellys' friends in prison now,  

307
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:49,840
but they stop them buying land. And why? 
Because they are friends of the Kelly Gang...
 
 

308
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,240
***

309
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,720
'We must do something,' Ned said,  

310
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,320
'to help our friends. We need a new 
country - a country for poor people,  

311
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,920
with good police, and good judges. But it's not 
going to happen easily. We must fight for it!'

312
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,120
'We need money for that,'  

313
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,920
said Joe. 'A lot of money. And there's a 
policeman with a gun at every bank now.'

314
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:27,520
'We need armour, to go over our heads and bodies,' 
Ned said. 'Bullets can't get through armour.'

315
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,240
'How are we going to get armour?' asked Dan.

316
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,320
'We can make it,' said Ned.

317
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,760
And they did. With help from their friends,  

318
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,360
they made four suits of armour from old farm 
machinery. Then they began to plan their fight.

319
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,440
'Our friends want to help,' Ned said. 'They 
have guns, and they want to fight with us. So  

320
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,280
we need to bring a lot of policemen 
to one place. How can we do that?'

321
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,960
'With a killing,' said Joe. 
'We kill Aaron Sherritt.  

322
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,320
He's working for the police - he tells 
them everything about us! You know it,  

323
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,640
I know it, everybody knows it. He was a 
friend once, but now he wants to see us dead!'

324
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,920
'Yes, that's true,' Ned said. 
'We hear it from everybody. So,  

325
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,080
you go to Aaron's house at Beechworth 
and shoot him. You and Dan.'

326
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,960
'Right,' said Dan. 'And then when the 
Beechworth police hear about the killing,  

327
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,520
they know it's us, the Kelly Gang. So they 
ask for help from the police at Benalla...'

328
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,800
'And the Benalla police take the train to 
Beechworth,' said Steve. 'Lots of police,  

329
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,040
all in one train.'

330
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,640
'And we', Ned said quietly, 'are 
waiting for the train at Glenrowan...'

331
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,160
The plan began well. Joe and Dan rode to 
Beechworth. When Aaron Sherritt opened his door on  

332
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:33,360
Saturday 26th June, Joe shot him at once. Then the 
two outlaws rode sixty kilometres across country  

333
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,640
to Glenrowan. News of the 
killing went down to Benalla.

334
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:48,400
Ned and Steve arrived at Glenrowan Inn on 
Saturday afternoon. They began to bring  

335
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,120
hostages into the inn - people from the railway 
station, railway workers, people from the town.  

336
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,920
Then Ned took some of the railway workers 
to the hill just past the railway station.

337
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,720
'Take up the railway line,' he told them. 'Go on!'

338
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,560
'We can't do that!' one worker said. 'Do you 
want to kill everybody on the next train?'

339
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,720
Then he saw Ned's gun, and 
asked no more questions.  

340
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,400
The workers took up three metres of railway 
line, and went back to the inn with Ned.  

341
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Joe and Dan were there now, and some of the 
gang's friends. Other friends, about thirty men,  

342
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,840
stayed near the railway line. In the inn 
there was a lot of drinking that night.

343
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:59,040
On Sunday morning Ned found more hostages - the 
schoolteacher, Thomas Curnow, with his young wife,  

344
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,880
baby, and sister. There were now 
sixty-two hostages in the inn.  

345
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,760
And everybody waited for the police train.

346
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,520
The police moved very slowly. In 
Beechworth, Benalla, and Melbourne  

347
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,040
they talked, made plans, and talked some more.  

348
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,880
In the end, a police train left Melbourne 
late on Sunday evening. And that evening  

349
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:40,560
Ned told about twenty of the hostages, 'You can 
go home.' Later, the schoolteacher came to him.

350
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,520
'Can I take my family home?' he asked.  

351
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,760
'Don't be afraid of me - you 
know I'm a friend of the Kellys.'

352
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,440
'Yes, you can go,' said Ned.

353
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,240
Thomas Curnow was a brave man. 
He took his young family home,  

354
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,160
and later went quietly out into the 
night and along the railway line.  

355
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,440
At three o'clock in the morning he heard 
the train, and held up a red light.

356
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,120
'Stop! Stop!' he cried.

357
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
***

358
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,800
At the inn, Ned and the gang heard 
the train too. They listened,  

359
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:37,520
but there was no noise of a crash, no train 
falling through the trees, no cries and shouts.

360
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,840
'What's happening?' Steve said.

361
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,360
'Nothing,' said Ned. 'Somebody stopped the 
train before it got to the broken rails.  

362
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,840
Put your armour on, boys, and get ready to fight.'

363
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,680
The gang went out to the front of the 
inn. They began to fire at the police,  

364
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,840
and the police fired back. 
Bullets went everywhere.

365
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,720
Three of the hostages inside the inn died.  

366
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:22,160
The police shot Ned in the arm 
and the foot, and Joe in the leg.

367
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,360
'Go back into the inn,' Ned said to the gang.  

368
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,880
'I must find our friends. 
They must get away from here.'

369
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,840
The gang's friends were near the railway line.

370
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,920
'We want to fight, Ned,' they 
said. 'Take us with you!'

371
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,960
'No, no, you must get away,' said 
Ned. 'The plan for the train went  

372
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,920
wrong, and there are police everywhere. 
This is our fight. You can't help us! Go!'

373
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:08,400
Back at the inn, the shooting did not stop. The 
hostages, many of them women and children, were  

374
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:17,840
on the floor, their faces white and afraid. Joe 
was in the front room with a drink in his hand.

375
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,360
'I drink to the Kelly Gang!' he cried.  

376
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:32,240
Then a bullet came through the 
wall and hit him. He died at once.

377
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,360
The wounds in Ned's arm and foot were bad, 
and in the trees he fell to the ground.  

378
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,800
A friend tried to help him, but for some hours  

379
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:59,840
Ned could not move. Then, slowly, he stood up, 
and in his armour began to walk back to the inn.  

380
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,760
His brother Dan and Steve Hart were still 
inside the inn, and Ned went back to help them.

381
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:20,800
In the early morning light, he came slowly 
out of the trees, his gun in his hand. One man  

382
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,320
against thirty-four policemen.  

383
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:33,360
They fired and fired at him, but the 
bullets hit Ned's armour, and Ned laughed.

384
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:42,080
'Go on - fire! You can't kill me!' he called.

385
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:51,680
But there was no armour on Ned's legs. One of the 
policemen saw this, and fired - once, twice...  

386
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,960
The bullets hit Ned's legs, and 
he fell slowly to the ground.

387
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,160
At once the police were all around him.  

388
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,920
He was alive, but only just, and they 
carried him to the railway station.

389
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,920
Soon after this, the last 
hostages left Glenrowan Inn.

390
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,120
Only Dan and Steve were still inside, but the 
police did not stop firing at the building.  

391
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,840
Later on that Monday morning a second train 
arrived in Glenrowan, with more police,  

392
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,720
photographers, and newspaper men. There were 
now more than a thousand people in the town.  

393
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,800
And down south, in Melbourne, hundreds of people 
waited in the streets for news of the Kelly Gang.

394
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,000
On Monday afternoon Ned's sisters, 
Maggie and Kate, arrived in Glenrowan.  

395
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,520
They heard the news about Ned, 
and then asked for news of Dan.

396
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,200
'Maggie, tell your brother and Steve Hart to 
put down their guns and come out of the inn,'  

397
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,800
said a policeman.

398
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,640
'Tell them to stop fighting? Never!' said Maggie.

399
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:32,720
Maggie and Kate did not see Dan alive again. 
The police were afraid to go into the inn,  

400
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,080
but they did not want Dan and Steve to get away 
in the night. So they set fire to the building.

401
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:49,440
Old buildings burn fast, and when Maggie and 
Kate got to the inn, the sky was red with fire.

402
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,160
'Dan! Oh, Dan!' Maggie 
called out, again and again.

403
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,840
'My poor, poor brother!' Kate cried.

404
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
***

405
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,760
Glenrowan Inn burnt down to the ground.  

406
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:17,280
When the fire was cold, they took out the dead 
bodies of Dan Kelly, Steve Hart, and Joe Byrne.  

407
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:29,840
Ned was alive, but in prison. It 
was the end of the Kelly Gang.
 
 
 

408
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,920
CHAPTER SIX

409
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,760
Ned's Last Days
 

410
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,760
JULY, 1880. The police take Ned Kelly 
to Benalla, then to Melbourne prison.  

411
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,600
There is a lot of waiting, and talking, and 
more talking. The police talk, the judges talk,  

412
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,040
Ned talks - but the ending is always the same.
 
 

413
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
***

414
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,480
At the end of October Ned went before his 
last judge, Sir Redmond Barry, in Melbourne.  

415
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,200
For two days Judge Barry listened to the police,  

416
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,840
listened to Ned, read the police papers, and 
thought about it. But he didn't think long.  

417
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,520
There were a lot of dead policemen in Ned Kelly's 
life, and there was only one answer to that.

418
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,480
Ned Kelly must die.  

419
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:54,880
Hang him in the prison. Hang him by the neck until 
he is dead. A lesson to every outlaw in Australia.

420
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,840
***

421
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:06,640
Ned's mother Ellen was still in Melbourne 
prison. When they told her the news, she cried -  

422
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:13,680
she cried for her dead son Dan, and she cried 
for her son Ned, alive, but waiting to die.  

423
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:24,160
They took her to see Ned on his last day alive. 
What did mother and son talk about that day?

424
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,480
Ned's sisters and brother worked hard to help him.

425
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,880
'How can they do this?' said 
Maggie angrily. 'How can they  

426
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:44,800
hang poor Ned? What did the police do to 
him? Why don't the judges think about that?'

427
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,480
'Shh, Maggie,' said Jim. 'No time for that now.  

428
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,320
We must get out there and talk 
to the people in the town.'

429
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:03,920
And so they did. They went all round Melbourne, 
to all the hotels, talking to everybody.

430
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,120
'They're going to hang Ned Kelly. What 
do you think about that?' they asked.

431
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,400
'It's not right,' said one man.

432
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:19,040
'Why do they want to hang him?' a second 
man said. 'Because he killed a policeman?  

433
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,240
No. Because he helps poor people 
and gives them money, that's why.'

434
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,280
'But what can we do?' asked a third man.

435
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,320
'Put your names on our petition,' was the answer.

436
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:45,840
There were more than 32,000 names on the Kelly 
petition, but the petition changed nothing.

437
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:54,000
So the last visitors came to see Ned on the 
10th of November, and he ate his last dinner.  

438
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,160
Then he sang for half an hour, and went to bed.

439
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,480
Next morning they took Ned across 
the prison to a room with a rope.

440
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:18,720
Outside the prison more than 5000 people 
waited - men and women, rich and poor.

441
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,760
'Where's the Kelly family?' one woman asked.

442
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,400
'Some of them are here, at the hotel,' 
was the answer. 'But Maggie went back  

443
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,760
to Beechworth yesterday. She wanted to 
be with her children. And there's Ned's  

444
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,840
poor mother - she's in the prison 
too, waiting for ten o'clock.'

445
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:50,400
Then the prisoners in Melbourne prison began to 
make a terrible noise, shouting and crying out and  

446
00:53:50,400 --> 00:54:00,080
banging on their doors. And in her room 
Ellen Kelly cried quietly for her oldest son.

447
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,840
In the hotel Jim Kelly sat 
with his head in his hands.

448
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,400
'Poor Ned, this is the end of 
all his troubles,' he said.

449
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:27,920
And at ten o'clock, the prison officers put the 
rope around Ned Kelly's neck and hanged him.

450
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
***

451
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:40,480
Ned was dead - but in the north-east, life 
went on. Sixty-eight people got money from  

452
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,640
the Kelly Gang reward. Schoolteacher 
Thomas Curnow got 1000 pounds.

453
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:56,880
A new man, Policeman Graham, came to Greta. 
He was a good policeman, and Ned's friends  

454
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,600
listened to him. 'Don't make trouble, and 
then you can buy your farms,' he told them.  

455
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,640
He went to Eleven Mile Creek and had tea 
with Ellen Kelly. Everyone talked about that.

456
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:21,840
Slowly things began to change. The police 
tried to be more friendly, to help poor people,  

457
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:28,240
and not just the rich. Most of the young men 
stopped stealing and fighting the police.  

458
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,840
Soon it was quiet in the north-east.

459
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,520
The other Kelly children stayed out of trouble.  

460
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:46,320
Jim Kelly was a good son to his mother all her 
life. Ellen lived to the age of ninety-three,  

461
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,520
and had many grandchildren. But she 
never forgot her oldest son Ned.

462
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,880
***

463
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,120
Who was the real Ned Kelly? Did he fight 
for the poor, or just for Ned Kelly?  

464
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,600
Some people say he was a brave 
man. Some people say he was a fool.  

465
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,480
Some people say he was just a 
killer, just a wild man with a gun.

466
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,240
One thing is sure.  

467
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,280
More than a hundred years later people are still 
talking about him. There are books about him,  

468
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:43,840
and songs and films and websites. Everybody still 
remembers Australia's most famous outlaw.
 
 
 
 

469
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,197
- THE END -
