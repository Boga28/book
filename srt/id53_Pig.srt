CHAPTER ONE
Pig

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,940
Once upon a time, in the city of New York,
a beautiful baby boy was born, and his joyful

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,820
parents named him Lexington.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,250
The mother had just returned from hospital
carrying Lexington in her arms when she said

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,179
to her husband, 'Darling, now you must take
me out to a most wonderful restaurant for

6
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,179
dinner.'

7
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,600
Her husband kissed her and told her that any
woman who could have such a beautiful baby

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,220
as Lexington deserved to go anywhere she wanted.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,610
So that evening they both dressed themselves
in their best clothes and, leaving little

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,110
Lexington in the care of a trained nurse who
was costing them twenty dollars a day, they

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,280
went out to the finest and most expensive
restaurant in town.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,230
After a wonderful evening, they arrived back
at their house at around two o'clock in the

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,570
morning.

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,280
The husband paid the taxi driver and then
began feeling in his pockets for the key to

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,350
the front door.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,960
After a while, he announced that he must have
left it in the pocket of his other suit, and

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,750
he suggested they ring the bell and get the
nurse to come down and let them in.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,110
A nurse who was costing them twenty dollars
a day must expect to have to get out of bed

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,119
occasionally in the night, the husband said.

20
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,170
So he rang the bell.

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,899
They waited.

22
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,610
Nothing happened.

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,670
He rang it again, long and loud.

24
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,710
They waited another minute.

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,810
Then they both stepped back on to the street
and shouted the nurse's name up at the nursery

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,460
window on the third floor, but there was still
no answer.

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,670
The house was dark and silent.

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,210
The wife began to become frightened.

29
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,159
If the nurse couldn't hear the front doorbell,
then how did she expect to hear the baby crying?

30
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,990
'You mustn't worry.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,759
I'll let you in.'

32
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,049
He was feeling rather brave after all he had
drunk.

33
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,479
He bent down and took off a shoe.

34
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,440
Then, holding the shoe by the toe, he threw
it hard and straight through the dining-room

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,220
window on the ground floor.

36
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,390
'There you are,' he said, laughing.

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,200
He stepped forward and very carefully put
a hand through the hole in the glass and undid

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,640
the lock.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,170
Then he raised the window.

40
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,810
'I'll lift you in first, little mother,' he
said, and he took his wife around the waist

41
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,610
and lifted her off the ground.

42
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,140
Then her husband turned her round and began
moving her gently through the open window

43
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,760
into the dining room.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,480
At this moment, a police car came driving
silently along the street towards them.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,370
It stopped about thirty meters away and three
policemen jumped out of the car and started

46
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,510
running in the direction of the husband and
wife.

47
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,510
The policemen were all holding guns.

48
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,840
'Hands up!' the policemen shouted.

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,730
'Hands up!'

50
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,310
But it was impossible for the husband to obey
this order without letting go of his wife.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,780
If he had done this, she would either have
fallen to the ground or would have been left

52
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,030
half in and half out of the house, which is
a very uncomfortable position for a woman;

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,230
so he continued to push her upwards and inwards
through the window.

54
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,990
The policemen, all of whom had received rewards
before for killing robbers, shot at them immediately.

55
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,770
Although the policemen were still running,
they hit both bodies several times and killed

56
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,540
both of them.

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:43,730
So, when he was no more than twelve days old,
little Lexington became an orphan.

58
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,320
The news of this killing was brought to all
the relatives of the dead couple by newspaper

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,110
reporters, and the next morning the closest
of the relatives got into taxis and left for

60
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,810
the house with the broken window.

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,760
They gathered in the living room and sat around
in a circle, smoking cigarettes and talking

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,220
about what should be done with the baby upstairs,
the orphan Lexington.

63
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,230
It soon became clear that none of the relatives
wanted responsibility for the child, and they

64
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,390
talked and argued all through the day.

65
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,659
Everybody declared an enormous desire to look
after him, and would have done so with the

66
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:26,629
greatest of pleasure but their apartment was
too small, or they already had one baby and

67
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:31,069
couldn't possibly afford another, or they
wouldn't know what to do with the poor little

68
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:36,080
child when they went abroad in the summer,
or they were getting old, which would surely

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,210
be very unfair on the boy.

70
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,090
They all knew, of course, that the father
had been heavily in debt for a long time and

71
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,009
that there would be no money at all to go
with the child.

72
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:53,650
They were still arguing at six the next morning
when suddenly, in the middle of it all, an

73
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,930
old aunt (her name was Glosspan) arrived from
Virginia.

74
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,240
Without taking off her hat and coat, without
even sitting down, she announced firmly to

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,449
the gathered relatives that she herself intended
to look after the baby boy.

76
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,350
She would take full responsibility, she said,
for the boy's education - and all the costs

77
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,830
- and everyone else could go home.

78
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,000
She went upstairs to the nursery and took
Lexington and went out of the house with the

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
baby held tightly in her arms.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,469
The relatives simply sat, stared, smiled and
looked content.

81
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:38,719
And so the baby, Lexington, left the city
of New York when he was thirteen days old

82
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:46,909
and travelled southwards to live with Great
Aunt Glosspan in the State of Virginia.

83
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:51,169
Aunt Glosspan was nearly seventy when she
took Lexington to Virginia, but you would

84
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,229
never have guessed it.

85
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,610
She was as youthful as a woman half her age.

86
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,810
She had a small, but still quite beautiful
face and two lovely brown eyes.

87
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,759
But she was a strange old woman.

88
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,460
For the past thirty years she had lived alone
in a small cottage high up on the slopes of

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,189
the Blue Ridge Mountains, several kilometers
from the nearest village.

90
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:20,729
She had three cows, some fields for them,
some land for growing vegetables, a flower

91
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,860
garden and a dozen chickens.

92
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,759
And now she had little Lexington, too.

93
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,500
She was a strict vegetarian and thought that
eating animal meat was not only unhealthy

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,759
and disgusting, but cruel, too.

95
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:43,069
She lived on foods like milk, butter, eggs,
cheese, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and she

96
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,970
was happy to think that no creature would
ever be slaughtered for her sake.

97
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,599
She did not know very much about babies but
that didn't worry her.

98
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,589
At the railway station in New York she bought
some things for feeding the baby and a book

99
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,909
called The Care Of Infants.

100
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,810
What more could anyone want?

101
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,099
When the train started moving, she fed the
baby some milk and laid it down on the seat

102
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,809
to sleep.

103
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:16,719
Then she read The Care Of Infants from beginning
to end.

104
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,770
Strangely there wasn't any problem.

105
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,870
Back home in the cottage everything went well.

106
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,830
Little Lexington drank his milk and cried
and slept exactly as a good baby should, and

107
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,169
Aunt Glosspan was filled with joy whenever
she looked at him and she kissed him all day

108
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,060
long.

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,120
By the time he was six years old, young Lexington
had become a most beautiful boy with long

110
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,629
golden hair and deep blue eyes.

111
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:51,749
He was bright and cheerful, and already he
was learning to help his old aunt in all sorts

112
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:58,020
of different ways around the farm, collecting
the eggs from the chicken house, making butter,

113
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,090
and digging up potatoes in the vegetable garden.

114
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,909
Soon, Aunt Glosspan told herself, she would
have to start thinking about his education.

115
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,080
But she could not bear the thought of sending
him away to school.

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,490
She loved him so much now that it would kill
her to be separated from him for long.

117
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,469
There was, of course, that village school
down in the valley, but it was a horrible-looking

118
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,639
place, and if she sent him there, she was
sure they would start forcing him to eat meat

119
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,580
as soon as he arrived.

120
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,509
'You know what, my darling?'

121
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:36,219
she said to him one day when he was sitting
in the kitchen watching her make cheese.

122
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,710
'I'll teach you myself.'

123
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,509
The boy looked at her with his large blue
eyes, and gave her a trusting smile.

124
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:47,339
'That would be nice,' he said.

125
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,910
'And the first thing I should do is to teach
you how to cook.'

126
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,170
'I think I would like that, Aunt Glosspan.'

127
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,120
'You're going to have to learn some time,'
she said.

128
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,320
'Vegetarians like us don't have nearly so
many foods to choose from as ordinary people,

129
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,970
and so they must learn to cook doubly well.'

130
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:16,870
'Aunt Glosspan,' the boy said, 'what do ordinary
people eat that we don't?'

131
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,030
'Animals,' she answered with disgust.

132
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,860
'Do you mean live animals?'

133
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,769
'No,' she said.

134
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,550
'Dead ones.'

135
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,449
'Do you mean that when they die they eat them
instead of burying them?'

136
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:37,060
'They don't wait for them to die, dear.

137
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,529
They kill them.'

138
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,220
'How do they kill them, Aunt Glosspan?'

139
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,399
'They usually cut their throats with a knife.'

140
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,180
'But what kind of animals?'

141
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,480
'Cows and pigs mostly, and sheep.'

142
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,560
'Cows!'

143
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
the boy cried.

144
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,410
'You mean like our cows?'

145
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,140
'Exactly, my dear.'

146
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,970
'But how do they eat them, Aunt Glosspan?'

147
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,170
'They cut them up into little bits and they
cook them.

148
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,210
They like the meat best when it's all red
and bloody and sticking to the bones.

149
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,279
They love to eat cow's flesh with the blood
running out of it.'

150
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,060
'Pigs, too?'

151
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,740
'They love pigs.'

152
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,959
'Lumps of pig's meat,' the boy said.

153
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,079
'Imagine that.

154
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,699
What else do they eat, Aunt Glosspan?'

155
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:29,699
'Chickens.'

156
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:30,699
'Chickens?

157
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:32,649
Feathers, too?'

158
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,630
'No, dear, not the feathers.

159
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,149
Now go outside and play, will you?'

160
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,399
Soon after that, the lessons began.

161
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,680
There were five subjects, including reading
and writing, but cooking was the most popular

162
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,110
with both teacher and pupil.

163
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,690
In fact, it soon became very clear that young
Lexington was a talented cook.

164
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,580
He was clever and quick.

165
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,870
In so young a boy, this surprised Aunt Glosspan
and she could not quite understand it at all.

166
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,150
But she was very proud of him and thought
that the child would have a wonderful future.

167
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:19,680
'How good it is,' she said, 'that I have such
a wonderful little fellow to look after me

168
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,149
when I'm old.'

169
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,690
A couple of years later, she left the kitchen
forever, and put Lexington in charge of all

170
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,810
household cooking.

171
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,079
The boy was now ten years old, and Aunt Glosspan
was nearly eighty.

172
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,670
Alone in the kitchen, Lexington immediately
began experimenting with dishes of his own

173
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,370
invention.

174
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,700
There were hundreds of new ideas in his head.

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,020
Hardly a day went by without some wonderful
new dish being placed on the table.

176
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,140
There were many delicious inventions.

177
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,709
Aunt Glosspan had never tasted food like this
in all her life.

178
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,899
In the mornings, before lunch, she would go
outside the house and sit there in her chair,

179
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,279
thinking about the coming meal.

180
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,870
She loved to sit there and smell what came
through the kitchen window.

181
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,889
Then he would come out, this ten-year-old
child, a little smile of pleasure on his face

182
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,060
and a big steaming pot of the most wonderful
food imaginable in his hands.

183
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,019
'Do you know what you ought to do?'

184
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,279
his aunt said to him, eating the food.

185
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,839
'You ought to sit down and write a cookbook.'

186
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,940
He looked at her across the table, eating
slowly.

187
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,579
'Why not?'

188
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,870
she cried.

189
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:42,790
'I've taught you how to write and I've taught
you how to cook, and now you've only got to

190
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,380
put the two things together.

191
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,839
You write a cookbook, my darling, and it'll
make you famous all over the world.'

192
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,399
'All right,' he said.

193
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,180
'I will.'

194
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,029
And that same day, Lexington began writing
the first page of that great book on which

195
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,579
he worked for the rest of his life.

196
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:07,850
He called it Eat Well And Healthily.

197
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,990
Seven years later, by the time he was seventeen,
he had recorded over nine thousand different

198
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,850
recipes, all of them original, all of them
wonderful.

199
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,629
But now, suddenly, his work was interrupted
by the death of Aunt Glosspan.

200
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:29,170
She was ill during the night and Lexington
found her lying on the bed screaming with

201
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,310
pain.

202
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,959
She was a terrible sight.

203
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,279
The boy wondered what he should do.

204
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,529
Finally, to cool her down, he fetched a bucket
of water from the river and poured it over

205
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:47,160
her head, but this only made her worse, and
the old lady died in an hour.

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,420
'This is really too bad,' the poor boy said,
pinching her several times to make sure that

207
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,269
she was dead.

208
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,269
'And how sudden!

209
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,129
Only a few hours ago she seemed in the very
best health.

210
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:08,880
She even ate three large portions of my newest
mushroom dish and told me how good it was.'

211
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,000
After crying bitterly for several minutes,
because he had loved his aunt very much, he

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,760
carried her outside and buried her in the
garden.

213
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,269
The next day, while he was tidying up her
things, he found an envelope that was addressed

214
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,660
to him in Aunt Glosspan's handwriting.

215
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,500
He opened it and took out two fifty-dollar
notes and a letter.

216
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,660
The letter said:

217
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,610
Darling boy, I know that you have never been
down the mountain since you were thirteen

218
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,730
days old, but as soon as I die you must put
on a pair of shoes and a clean shirt and walk

219
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,629
down into the village and find the doctor.

220
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,790
Ask the doctor to give you a death certificate.

221
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:00,310
Then take this to my lawyer, a man called
Mr Samuel Zuckermann, who lives in New York

222
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,399
City and who has a copy of my will.

223
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,959
Mr Zuckermann will arrange everything.

224
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,170
The money in this envelope is to pay the doctor
for the certificate and for the cost of your

225
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,720
journey to New York.

226
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,839
Mr Zuckermann will give you more money when
you get there, and it is my wish that you

227
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,589
use it to continue your work on that great
book of yours until you are satisfied that

228
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,660
it is complete in every way.

229
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,691
Your loving aunt, Glosspan

230
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:40,740
Lexington, who had always done everything
his aunt had told him, put the money in his

231
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,399
pocket, put on a pair of shoes and a clean
shirt, and went down the mountain to the village

232
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,450
where the doctor lived.

233
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,750
'Old Glosspan?'

234
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,750
the doctor said.

235
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,410
'Is she dead?'

236
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,839
'Certainly she's dead,' the boy answered.

237
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,279
'If you come home with me now I'll dig her
up and you can see for yourself.'

238
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,519
'How deep did you bury her?'

239
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,750
the doctor asked.

240
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,480
'Two or three meters down, I think.'

241
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,389
'And how long ago?'

242
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,149
'Oh, about eight hours.'

243
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,100
'Then she's dead,' the doctor announced.

244
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,379
'Here's the certificate.'

245
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,269
Lexington now left for the city of New York
to find Mr Samuel Zuckermann.

246
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:30,150
He travelled on foot, and he slept under bushes,
and he lived on berries and wild plants, and

247
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,180
it took him sixteen days to reach the city.

248
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,550
'What a place this is!' he cried, as he stood
staring around him.

249
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,879
'There are no chickens or cows anywhere and
none of the women looks like Aunt Glosspan

250
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,449
at all.'

251
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,730
Lexington had never seen anyone like Mr Zuckermann
before, either.

252
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,389
He was a small man with a large nose, and
when he smiled, bits of gold flashed at you

253
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,439
from lots of different places inside his mouth.

254
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,650
In his office, he shook Lexington warmly by
the hand and congratulated him on his aunt's

255
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,650
death.

256
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,689
'I suppose you know that your dearly loved
aunt was a woman of great wealth?' he said.

257
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,819
'Do you mean the cows and the chickens?'

258
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,559
'I mean five hundred thousand dollars,' Mr
Zuckermann said.

259
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
'How much?'

260
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,870
'Five hundred thousand dollars, my boy.

261
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,779
And she's left it all to you.'

262
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,950
Mr Zuckermann leaned back in his chair.

263
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,060
'Of course, I shall have to take 50 percent
for my services,' he said, 'but that still

264
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,110
leaves you with two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.'

265
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,549
'I am rich!'

266
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:46,549
Lexington cried.

267
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,520
'This is wonderful!

268
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,040
How soon can I have my money?'

269
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:58,420
'Well,' said Mr Zuckermann, 'luckily for you,
I know the people at the city tax office and

270
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm confident that I'll be able to persuade
them to forget about any taxes that your aunt

271
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
owed.'

272
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,460
'How kind you are,' said Lexington.

273
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,710
'I shall have to give some people a small
tip, of course.'

274
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,970
'Whatever you say, Mr Zuckermann.'

275
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,080
'I think a hundred thousand would be enough.'

276
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,590
'But how much does that leave for me?'

277
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,020
the youth asked.

278
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,130
'One hundred and fifty thousand.

279
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,230
But then you've got the funeral expenses to
pay out of that.'

280
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,710
'Funeral expenses?'

281
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,080
'You've got to pay the funeral company.

282
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,980
Surely you know that?'

283
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,000
'But I buried her myself, Mr Zuckermann, in
the field behind the house.

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,340
I never used a funeral company.'

285
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,100
'Listen,' Mr Zuckermann said patiently.

286
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,950
'You may not know it but there is a law in
this State which says that no one can receive

287
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,360
any money from a will until the funeral company
has been paid.'

288
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,180
'You mean that's a law?'

289
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,580
'Certainly it's a law, and a very good law,
too.

290
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,880
Funerals are one of our country's great traditions.

291
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,460
They must be protected at all costs.'

292
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,059
Mr Zuckermann himself, together with a group
of doctors, controlled a large funeral company

293
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,820
in the city.

294
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,950
The celebration of death was therefore a deeply
religious affair in Mr Zuckermann's opinion.

295
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,200
'You had no right to go out and bury your
aunt like that,' he said.

296
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,250
'None at all.'

297
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,070
'I'm very sorry, Mr Zuckermann.'

298
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,360
'It's completely un-American.'

299
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,490
'I'll do whatever you say, Mr Zuckermann.

300
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,549
All I want to know is how much I'm going to
get in the end, when everything's paid.'

301
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:54,860
There was a pause.

302
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,070
'Shall we say fifteen thousand?' he suggested,
flashing a big gold smile.

303
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,080
'That's a nice figure.'

304
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,159
'Can I take it with me this afternoon?'

305
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,880
'I don't see why not.'

306
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,780
So Mr Zuckermann called his chief clerk and
told him to give Lexington fifteen thousand

307
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,240
dollars.

308
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,450
The youth, who was delighted to be getting
anything at all, accepted the money gratefully

309
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,049
and put it in his bag.

310
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:29,200
Then he shook Mr Zuckermann warmly by the
hand, thanked him for all his help, and went

311
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,590
out of the office.

312
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,730
'The whole world is in front of me!'

313
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,580
Lexington cried as he went into the street.

314
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:43,490
'I now have fifteen thousand dollars to help
me until my book is ready.

315
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,720
After that, of course, I shall have a lot
more.'

316
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,299
He stood in the street, wondering which way
to go.

317
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:57,120
He turned left and began walking slowly down
the street, staring at the sights of the city.

318
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,830
'I must have something to eat.

319
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm so hungry!' he said.

320
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,450
The boy had eaten nothing except berries and
wild plants for the past two weeks, and now

321
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,030
his stomach wanted solid food.

322
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,370
He crossed the street and entered a small
restaurant.

323
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,880
The place was hot inside, and dark and silent.

324
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,210
There was a strong smell of cooking-fat.

325
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,700
Lexington seated himself at a corner table
and hung his bag on the back of the chair.

326
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,169
This, he told himself, is going to be most
interesting.

327
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:36,270
In all my seventeen years I have tasted only
the cooking of two people, Aunt Glosspan and

328
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,300
myself.

329
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:44,409
But now I am going to try the food of a new
cook and perhaps, if I am lucky, I might get

330
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,820
a few ideas for my book.

331
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,610
A waiter came out of the shadows at the back
and stood beside the table.

332
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,010
'Do you want the roast pork and potatoes?'
he asked.

333
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,529
'That's all we've got left.'

334
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:02,030
'Roast what and potatoes?'

335
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,550
The waiter took a dirty handkerchief from
his trouser pocket and shook it open.

336
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,500
Then he blew his nose loudly.

337
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,380
'Do you want it or don't you?' he said, wiping
his nose.

338
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,919
'I don't know what it is,' Lexington answered,
'but I'd love to try it.

339
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,399
I'm writing a cookbook and...'

340
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:24,020
'One pork and potatoes!'

341
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,720
the waiter shouted, and somewhere in the back
of the restaurant, far away in the darkness,

342
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,920
a voice answered him.

343
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,919
The waiter disappeared and soon returned carrying
a plate on which there lay a thick grey-white

344
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,470
piece of something hot.

345
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,200
Lexington leaned forward anxiously to smell
it.

346
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,110
'But this is absolutely heavenly!' he cried.

347
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,130
'What a smell!

348
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,309
It's wonderful!'

349
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:53,360
The waiter stepped back a little, watching
the youth.

350
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,570
'I have never in all my life smelled anything
as wonderful as this!'

351
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,040
Lexington cried, seizing his knife and fork.

352
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,929
'What is it made of?'

353
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:08,590
But the waiter was moving backwards towards
the kitchen.

354
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,240
Lexington cut off a small piece of the meat
and put it into his mouth, beginning to eat

355
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,860
it slowly, his eyes half closed.

356
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,210
'This is wonderful!' he cried.

357
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,890
'It's a fine new flavour!

358
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,850
Oh, Glosspan, I wish you were here with me
now so that you could taste this dish!

359
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,070
Waiter!

360
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,350
Come here at once!

361
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,789
I want you!'

362
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:35,950
The waiter was now watching him from the other
end of the room.

363
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,480
'If you will come and talk to me, I will give
you a present,' Lexington said, waving a hundred-dollar

364
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,169
note.

365
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,300
'Please come over here and talk to me.'

366
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,149
The waiter came cautiously back to the table,
seized the money and put it quickly into his

367
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:53,220
pocket.

368
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,690
'What can I do for you, my friend?'

369
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,220
'Listen,' Lexington said.

370
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,740
'If you will tell me what this dish is made
of, and exactly how it is prepared, I will

371
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,559
give you another hundred.'

372
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,830
'I've already told you,' the man said.

373
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,999
'It's pork.'

374
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,480
'And what exactly is pork?'

375
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,620
'Have you never had roast pork before?'

376
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,240
the waiter asked, staring.

377
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,010
'Just tell me what it is.'

378
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,419
'It's pig,' the waiter said.

379
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,200
'You just put it in the oven.'

380
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,630
'Pig?'

381
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,640
'All pork is pig; didn't you know that?'

382
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,840
'You mean this is pig's meat?'

383
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,760
'Of course.'

384
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,860
'But... but... that's impossible,' the youth
said.

385
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:48,250
'Aunt Glosspan said that meat of any kind
was disgusting and horrible, but this is without

386
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,399
doubt the most wonderful thing I have ever
tasted.

387
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:55,070
How do you explain that?'

388
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,850
'Perhaps your aunt didn't know how to cook
it,' the waiter said.

389
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,169
'Is that possible?'

390
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:02,559
'It certainly is.

391
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,630
Especially with pork.

392
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,120
Pork has to be very well cooked or you can't
eat it.'

393
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,390
'That's it!'

394
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,390
Lexington cried.

395
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,770
'That's exactly what must have happened.

396
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,419
She cooked it wrong!'

397
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,640
He handed the man another hundred-dollar note.

398
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,790
'Lead me to the kitchen,' he said.

399
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,799
'Introduce me to the man who prepared this
meat.'

400
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,840
Lexington was at once taken to the kitchen,
and there he met the cook, who was an old

401
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,929
man with large, unpleasant red patches on
his skin.

402
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:41,309
'This will cost you another hundred,' the
waiter said.

403
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,820
Lexington was happy to pay, but this time
he gave the money to the cook.

404
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,789
'Now listen to me,' he said.

405
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:53,000
'I am really rather confused by what the waiter
has been telling me.

406
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,840
Are you quite sure that the dish I've been
eating was prepared from pig's flesh?'

407
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,760
The cook raised his right hand and began scratching
his neck.

408
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,140
'Well,' he said, winking at the waiter, 'all
I can tell you is that I think it was pig's

409
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
meat.'

410
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,890
'Do you mean you're not sure?'

411
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,460
'One can never be sure.'

412
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,100
'Then what else could it have been?'

413
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,270
'Well,' the cook said, speaking very slowly
and still staring at the waiter.

414
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,870
'There's just a chance that it could have
been a piece of human flesh.'

415
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,390
'Do you mean - a man?'

416
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,550
'Yes.'

417
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,870
'Good heavens!'

418
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,230
'Or a woman.

419
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,960
It could have been either.

420
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,680
They both taste the same.'

421
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,620
'Well - now you really surprise me,' the youth
said.

422
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,360
'One lives and learns.'

423
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,890
'In fact, we've been getting a lot of it recently
from the meat factory in place of pork,' the

424
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,890
cook declared.

425
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,580
'Have you really?'

426
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,529
'The trouble is, it's almost impossible to
tell which is which.

427
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,169
They're both very good.'

428
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,549
'The piece I had just now was wonderful.'

429
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,809
'I'm glad you liked it,' the cook said.

430
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,789
'But to be quite honest, I think that was
a bit of pig.

431
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:22,799
In fact, I'm almost sure it was.'

432
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,450
'You are?'

433
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,540
'Yes, I am.'

434
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,770
'In that case we shall have to believe you,'
Lexington said.

435
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,840
'So now will you please tell me - and here
is another hundred-dollar note for your trouble

436
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,809
- will you please tell me how you prepared
it?'

437
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:47,820
The cook, after taking the money, told Lexington
how to cook pork, while the youth, not wanting

438
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,730
to miss a single word, sat down at the kitchen
table and recorded every detail in his notebook.

439
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,010
'Is that all?' he asked when the cook had
finished.

440
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,549
'That's all, but you must have a good piece
of meat and it must be cut right.'

441
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,370
'Show me how,' said Lexington.

442
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,210
'Kill one now so I can learn.'

443
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,679
'We don't kill pigs in the kitchen,' the cook
said.

444
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,100
'The meat you've just eaten came from a slaughterhouse.'

445
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,450
'Then give me the address!'

446
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,080
The cook gave him the address, and Lexington,
after thanking them both many times for their

447
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,549
kindness, rushed outside and went by taxi
to the slaughterhouse.

448
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:35,220
It was a big brick building, and the air around
it smelled sweet and heavy.

449
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,940
At the main entrance gates, there was a large
notice which said: VISITORS ARE WELCOME AT

450
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,299
ANY TIME.

451
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:47,880
Lexington walked through the gates and entered
a yard which surrounded the building itself.

452
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,010
He then followed some signs (THIS WAY FOR
THE GUIDED TOURS) and came to a small hut

453
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,610
near the main building (VISITORS'WAITING ROOM).

454
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,010
After knocking politely on the door, he went
in.

455
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,400
There were six other people in the waiting
room.

456
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,899
There was a fat mother with her two little
boys aged about nine and eleven.

457
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:13,620
There was a bright-eyed young couple and there
was a pale woman with long white gloves, looking

458
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,650
straight ahead, with her hands folded in front
of her.

459
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,130
Nobody spoke.

460
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,789
Lexington wondered whether they were all writing
cookbooks, like himself, but when he put this

461
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:28,049
question to them aloud, he got no answer.

462
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:31,870
They just shook their heads and smiled.

463
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:38,799
Soon the door opened and a man with a pink
face came into the room and said, 'Next, please.'

464
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,370
The mother and the two boys got up and went
out.

465
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,720
About ten minutes later, the same man returned.

466
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,789
'Next, please,' he said again, and the couple
stood up and followed him outside.

467
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,690
Two new visitors came in and sat down - a
middle-aged husband and a middle-aged wife,

468
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,350
the wife carrying a basket.

469
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:06,480
'Next, please,' said the guide, and the woman
with the long gloves got up and left.

470
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,330
Several more people came in and took their
places on the wooden chairs.

471
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:16,059
Soon the guide returned for the third time,
and now it was Lexington's turn to go outside.

472
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:21,539
'Follow me, please,' the guide said, leading
the youth across the yard towards the main

473
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:22,539
building.

474
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:25,630
'How exciting this is!'

475
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,740
Lexington cried.

476
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,019
First they visited a big area at the back
of the building where several hundred pigs

477
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:34,440
were wandering around.

478
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,220
'Here's where they start,' the guide said.

479
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,010
'And over there is where they go in.'

480
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,010
'Where?'

481
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,899
'Right there.'

482
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:48,149
The guide pointed to a long wooden shed that
stood against the outside wall of the factory.

483
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:50,980
'This way, please.'

484
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,100
Three men, wearing long rubber boots, were
taking a dozen pigs into the shed just as

485
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,240
Lexington and the guide arrived, so they all
went in together.

486
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,490
'Now,' the guide said, 'watch how they catch
them.'

487
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:11,009
Inside, the shed was simply a bare wooden
room with no roof, but there was a metal wire

488
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:16,170
with hooks on it that kept moving slowly along
the length of one wall.

489
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,630
When it reached the end of the hut, it suddenly
changed direction and climbed upwards through

490
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,039
the open roof towards the top floor of the
main building.

491
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,509
The twelve pigs were brought together at the
far end of the hut.

492
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:31,730
They stood quietly and looked anxious.

493
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,500
One of the men in rubber boots pulled a length
of metal chain down from the wall and advanced

494
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,470
upon the nearest animal from the back.

495
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,240
Then he bent down and quickly put one end
of the chain around one of the animal's back

496
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,610
legs.

497
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,669
The other end he put on a hook on the moving
wire as it went by.

498
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:53,529
The wire kept moving and the chain tightened.

499
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:59,179
The pig's leg was pulled up and back, and
the pig itself began to be dragged backwards

500
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:04,970
until it reached the end of the hut, where
the wire changed direction and went upwards.

501
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,169
The creature was suddenly pulled off its feet
and was carried up.

502
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,390
The pig's cries filled the air.

503
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,929
'Truly interesting,' Lexington said.

504
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:20,659
The rubber-booted men were busy catching the
rest of the pigs, and one after another the

505
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:25,399
animals were hooked on to the moving wire
and carried up through the roof, crying loudly

506
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,929
as they went.

507
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:33,789
At this point, while Lexington was staring
upwards at the last pig, a man in rubber boots

508
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:39,870
came up quietly behind him and put one end
of a chain around the youth's own leg, hooking

509
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,150
the other end of the chain to the moving belt.

510
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:47,690
The next moment, before he had time to realize
what was happening, Lexington was pulled off

511
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,160
his feet and dragged backwards along the floor
of the hut.

512
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,840
'Stop!' he cried.

513
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,880
'Stop everything!

514
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,919
My leg is caught!'

515
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,399
But nobody seemed to hear him, and five seconds
later the unhappy young man was pulled off

516
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:07,809
the floor and lifted up through the open roof
of the hut upside down, panging like a fish.

517
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,010
'Help!' he shouted.

518
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,010
'Help!

519
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,740
There's been a mistake!

520
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
Stop the engine!

521
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,730
Let me down!'

522
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,710
The guide took a cigarette out of his mouth
and looked up at the youth hanging from the

523
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,950
chain, but he said nothing.

524
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,990
The men in rubber boots were already on their
way out to collect the next pigs.

525
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,960
'Oh, save me!'

526
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,020
Lexington cried.

527
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,750
'Let me down!

528
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,649
Please let me down!'

529
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:36,750
But he was now nearing the top floor of the
building, where the moving belt entered a

530
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,799
large hole in the wall, a kind of doorway
without a door; and there, waiting to greet

531
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,070
him, in dark-stained rubber clothes, the slaughterer
stood.

532
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,380
Lexington saw him only from upside down, and
very quickly, but he noticed the expression

533
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:00,190
of absolute peace on the man's face, the cheerfulness
in his eyes and the little smile.

534
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,200
All these things gave him hope.

535
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,820
'Hi, there!'

536
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,389
the man said, smiling.

537
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:06,389
'Quick!

538
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:07,389
Save me!'

539
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:08,500
Lexington cried.

540
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,050
'With pleasure,' the man said, and taking
Lexington gently by one ear with his left

541
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:20,069
hand, he raised his right hand and quickly
cut the boys throat with a knife.

542
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:22,310
The belt moved on.

543
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,510
Lexington went with it.

544
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,409
Everything was still upside down and the blood
was pouring out of his throat and getting

545
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,510
into his eyes, but he could still see a little.

546
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,690
He thought he was in a very long room, and
at the far end of the room there was a great

547
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,929
smoking pot of water, and there were dark
figures half hidden in the steam.

548
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:48,300
These figures were dancing round the edge
of the pot and they were holding long sticks.

549
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,370
The belt seemed to be travelling right over
the top of the pot and the pigs seemed to

550
00:34:53,370 --> 00:35:00,319
be dropping down one by one into the boiling
water and one of the pigs seemed to be wearing

551
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:05,430
long white gloves on its front feet.

552
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,200
Suddenly Lexington started to feel very sleepy,
but it was not until his good strong heart

553
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,089
had pumped the last drop of blood from his
body that he passed out of this, the best

554
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:18,090
of all possible worlds, into the next.

555
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,099
- THE END -
