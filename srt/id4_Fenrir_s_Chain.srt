1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:12,150
This is the story of Loki's children, and
what happened to them.

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:20,490
The god Loki had three children, but these
were not ordinary children.

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:30,900
Loki's children were a snake whose name was
Jormungand, a scary woman whose name was Hel,

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,410
and a wolf whose name was Fenrir.

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:45,120
At first they lived in Jotunheim, the country
of the giants, but then they all came to Asgard,

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,290
where the gods lived, and the gods were very
worried.

7
00:00:50,290 --> 00:01:01,270
'I don't like Loki's children!' said Odin,
the most important of the gods.

8
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,330
'Loki is a dangerous man.

9
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,219
He's always playing tricks.

10
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:14,770
His children will be as dangerous as he is!'

11
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,020
The goddess Freyja did not think the same
thing.

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,390
'But sometimes Loki is good,' she said.

13
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,560
'He has helped us lots of times.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,530
I think his children can live here in Asgard,
with us.'

15
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:46,280
'But they're a snake, a strange-looking, scary
woman and a wolf!' shouted Odin.

16
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,200
'They can't live here!'

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,470
Thor thought the same thing.

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,670
So first they took Jormungand the snake.

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:09,530
Jormungand was so big the gods needed all
the strength of Odin and Thor and two other

20
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,829
gods, Tyr and Balder, to pick him up.

21
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:22,489
Then, they threw him out of Asgard, which
was at the top of the world, all the way down

22
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,359
to Midgard.

23
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:34,069
With a big, loud noise, the snake fell into
the world of the humans.

24
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:41,829
In Midgard, Jormungand started to grow and
grow and grow.

25
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:50,919
In the end, there was no space left for him
there, so he went into the sea which was all

26
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,499
around Midgard.

27
00:02:54,499 --> 00:03:04,249
When he was in the sea, he grew and grew until
he made a circle around the entire world.

28
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:08,620
His tail went into his mouth.

29
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:19,680
'Now then,' said Odin, 'What about Loki's
daughter, Hel?'

30
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,629
The gods all looked at Hel, and even they
were frightened.

31
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:35,150
Her head was the head of a normal woman, but
the rest of her body was like a skeleton,

32
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,290
only bones and dead skin.

33
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:47,569
'I know what do with her,' said Odin, who
was very clever.

34
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:54,650
'This woman is half-alive and half-dead.

35
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:04,400
She can't live with us, because we're gods,
and she can't live with the humans in Midgard,

36
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,099
because she isn't human.

37
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,359
We'll send her to Niflheim!'

38
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:14,829
'To Niflheim!'

39
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,519
shouted Freyja.

40
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,729
'But that's a terrible place!

41
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:25,640
That is the place where people go when they
have died!'

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,180
'Exactly!' said Odin.

43
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,940
'Hel will be the best queen for Niflheim.

44
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:44,349
I'll give her a city there, and the name of
that city will be Hel, too!'

45
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:51,710
Because Odin was the most important god he
always got what he wanted.

46
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:59,870
So Hel was sent down to Niflheim where she
became the queen of all the people who have

47
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,870
died.

48
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:11,370
'So, then,' asked Thor, 'What are we going
to do with this wolf?'

49
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:19,940
All of the gods - Odin and Thor and Freyja
and Tyr and Balder looked at the wolf.

50
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,599
'A wolf is only a type of dog,' said Freyja.

51
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,110
'That's true,' said Thor.

52
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:39,419
'And if you're kind to a dog, the dog will
grow up to be a good dog.'

53
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:46,090
'Perhaps that's true for wolves, as well,'
said Freyja.

54
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,629
Again, all the gods looked at the wolf.

55
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,500
It was only a baby wolf.

56
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,610
It was beautiful, grey and white in colour,
with blue eyes.

57
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,560
He was quite a handsome wolf.

58
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,610
'You know what I think?'

59
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,610
asked Thor.

60
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:22,469
'No - and I'm not sure I really want to know
what you think!' said Odin slowly.

61
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:26,439
Thor's father did not think his son was very
intelligent.

62
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:32,130
'Tell us Thor!' said Tyr.

63
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,840
'I think he can live here,' said Thor.

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,560
'We've given homes to Loki's other two children,
and this one will be no trouble to us, the

65
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,110
gods, here in our home.'

66
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,650
'Thor is right!' said Freyja.

67
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,669
'Very well then,' said Odin, 'The wolf can
stay here!'

68
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:13,409
'Thank you!' said Fenrir - and the gods were
all surprised that a wolf could talk!

69
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:14,580
Everybody was very pleased.

70
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,479
The gods played with the wolf like a dog.

71
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:30,379
The god Tyr was his best friend, and they
played together all the time.

72
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,560
At first, everything was fine.

73
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,729
Fenrir the wolf lived in Asgard with the gods,
and played in the big fields and gardens like

74
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,550
an ordinary dog.

75
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,169
But Fenrir was always very hungry.

76
00:07:51,169 --> 00:08:03,629
He ate and ate and ate and as he ate he got
bigger and bigger and bigger.

77
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:11,919
Often, when he was hungry, he started to get
very angry.

78
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:20,999
The gods started to worry about this very
big, hungry, angry wolf that lived with them.

79
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:25,659
'We need to tie him up!' said Thor.

80
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:31,689
'I think you're right!' said Odin.

81
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:39,539
So the gods found the biggest, strongest,
thickest piece of rope they could find.

82
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,579
'Here, Fenrir!'

83
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,779
they shouted to the wolf.

84
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:53,810
'We're going to tie you up so you can stay
near us all the time!'

85
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,240
Fenrir did not like this.

86
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:04,200
But he thought that if he was close to the
gods, they would not leave him.

87
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,190
He thought they would give him lots of food
to eat.

88
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,680
So he came closer to them.

89
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,290
When he was very close, Thor pulled out the
rope and tied Fenrir up with it.

90
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,139
But Fenrir only laughed.

91
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,630
'Ha!' he said.

92
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,480
'Do you think you can tie me up with that?

93
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:41,540
I'm Fenrir, the strongest and biggest of all
the wolves!'

94
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:49,680
Then - very easily - he broke the big, thick
rope.

95
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,769
Now the gods were very worried.

96
00:09:53,769 --> 00:10:02,790
Every day, Fenrir ate more and more, and he
got bigger and bigger.

97
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:13,490
'We need to tie him up, but with a metal chain
and not a rope!' said Odin, and everybody

98
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,020
agreed with him.

99
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,610
So the gods made the biggest, strongest chain
they could.

100
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,320
'Come here!'

101
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,930
they said to Fenrir.

102
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:34,190
'Let us tie you with this chain, so you can
always be close to us.'

103
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:42,110
Again, Fenrir did not like this, but he let
the gods put the chain around him.

104
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:51,500
The gods tied the chain as tightly as they
could, but again, Fenrir only laughed.

105
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,220
'Ha!' he said.

106
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,600
'Do you think you can tie me up with this
little chain?

107
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,350
I'm Fenrir, the strongest and biggest of all
the wolves!'

108
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:20,040
He pushed his front legs, and then he pushed
his back legs and he growled, and then - snap!

109
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,329
The chain broke.

110
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:27,430
Now the gods were very worried.

111
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:35,329
'We have a very dangerous animal living in
Asgard with us!' said Tyr.

112
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:42,300
'That wolf is dangerous for all of us,' said
Freyja.

113
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,440
'You're right,' said Odin.

114
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,040
'We must tie him up.

115
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,550
And this time we'll make the strongest chain
of all!'

116
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,790
'What is that going to be?' asked Thor.

117
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,660
'Fenrir can break rope and metal chains easily!'

118
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,649
'What is the biggest and strongest thing of
all?' asked Odin.

119
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,290
'What can never be broken?'

120
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,820
'I don't know,' said Thor.

121
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,130
'A mountain?' said Balder.

122
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,649
'Exactly!' said Odin.

123
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:41,490
'We'll make a big, strong chain from a mountain!'

124
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:47,680
So the gods made a chain out of a mountain,
a chain of stone.

125
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:57,490
When the chain was ready, the gods asked Fenrir
to come to them, but Fenrir would not.

126
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:04,329
'You're going to try to tie me up again, aren't
you?' he said.

127
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:08,540
'I know what you're like!'

128
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,110
'No!' said Odin.

129
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,860
'We know you're the strongest and biggest
of all the wolves.

130
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:28,639
So we have made a chain out of a mountain,
because we want to see how strong you are!'

131
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,589
'Yes!' said Freyja.

132
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,389
'We want to see you break this chain!'

133
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:44,190
Fenrir did not like this, but he wanted the
gods to see how strong he was.

134
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:52,589
'How do I know this isn't a trick?' he asked
them.

135
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,180
This was a good question, and the gods thought
hard.

136
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,079
'I know what we'll do,' said Odin.

137
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:11,560
'To show you this isn't a trick, we'll put
the chain on you, and one of the gods will

138
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,520
put his hand in your mouth.

139
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:26,650
If you can't break the chain, then you can
bite off the hand of the god!'

140
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,779
This was a dangerous thing to say.

141
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:37,209
If a god only had one hand, he could not hold
a sword.

142
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:44,470
If a god could not hold a sword, he would
not be a strong god.

143
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,970
'Very well, then,' said Fenrir.

144
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,350
'Which god will put his hand in my mouth?'

145
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:06,420
Then he laughed, because he knew this was
a difficult thing for a god to do.

146
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,500
The gods all looked at each other.

147
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,620
None of the gods wanted to lose a hand.

148
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:22,149
The gods all looked at the big, strong teeth
of the wolf.

149
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,550
Only Tyr came forward.

150
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,320
Tyr was the bravest of the gods.

151
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,810
'I will!' he said.

152
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:39,839
'I'll put my hand in your mouth, and if you
can't break this chain, you can bite off my

153
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,350
hand!'

154
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,819
'Very well!' said Fenrir.

155
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,970
'Then let's start right now!'

156
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,590
He laughed again.

157
00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:02,899
Fenrir opened his mouth, and Tyr put his hand
between the wolf's strong teeth.

158
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:11,290
The gods took the big chain, made out of mountain,
and tied it around the wolf.

159
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,290
Fenrir pushed.

160
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,430
Fenrir pulled.

161
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:27,740
Fenrir growled, then pushed and pulled again,
trying to move his legs as hard as he could.

162
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:35,470
He became more and more angry, and tried harder
and harder.

163
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:44,649
But it was no good - the wolf could not break
the chain.

164
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:53,959
After an hour of trying to break the chain,
his long teeth closed on Tyr's hand.

165
00:16:53,959 --> 00:17:03,699
Tyr did not even cry out in pain - but he
knew he had lost his hand.

166
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:11,270
From now on, he would never be as strong again.

167
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:20,220
Fenrir the wolf still lives in Asgard, tied
up with a chain made out of stone.

168
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,700
He is still a very, very angry wolf, waiting
for a chance to escape.

169
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,180
- THE END -
