CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,260
Cairo

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,420
Monica noticed the gift shop, because of the
beautiful colours round its door and window.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,369
She walked through its entrance which had
a sign above it.

5
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,040
On the sign, the word Cairo was written in
bright yellow, orange and green colours, with

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,640
small black figures dancing beside it.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,700
Inside, it was just as colourful.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,000
Large animals made of paper, painted in very
bright colours, hung from the ceiling.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,150
The floor had a yellow-brown sand colour to
it, and the shelves held vases, plates, boxes,

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,570
musical instruments and jewellery Monica had
never seen before.

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,860
No one seemed to be in the shop; not a salesperson
or a customer.

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,010
Light Arab music came from a stereo Monica
could not see, but she moved with its sound

13
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,020
as she looked at all the wonderful objects
in the shop.

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,930
She saw a blue stone on a gold necklace which
looked interesting.

15
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,840
Drawn in the centre of the stone there was
something which looked like a large round

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,360
beetle, with thin legs and thick antennae
coming from its head.

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,190
"It's an Egyptian scarab."

18
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,280
The woman's voice surprised, then frightened
Monica.

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
She almost dropped the necklace.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,560
"I'm sorry I didn't know anyone was here."

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,960
"It's okay, my dear.

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,410
I knew you would be here.

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,410
Come.

24
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,410
Come."

25
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,700
The woman took Monica's arm and led her behind
the sales counter to a small area where there

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,150
was a round table and two chairs.

27
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,420
It was dark because cloth the colour of sand,
with dark patterns, hung from the walls and

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,459
ceilings.

29
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,970
It was almost closed off from the rest of
the shop by a curtain, so most of the light

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,950
came from a few candles set around the room.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,860
It was like a small cave from somewhere far
away.

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,860
"Sit.

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,080
I've made us some tea, black tea; the tea
of judgement."

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
"Judgement?"

35
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
"Yes.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,450
The tea leaves tell us about a person's entire
life.

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,470
Some of us have done things we wish we hadn't.

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,380
Some of us haven't done things we wish we
had.

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Some of us are messengers.

40
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,170
Some of us are waiting for the message."

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,340
The woman wore a piece of red cloth tied around
her head.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,270
It hid the colour of her hair.

43
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,900
Her eyes were large and dark.

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,270
They became larger when she talked.

45
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:10,460
As Monica sat at the table, she realised she
still had the necklace in her hand.

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,130
"This stone is quite beautiful.

47
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,680
I've never seen anything like it."

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,710
"It is lapis lazuli, the ancient blue stone
used to make statues for the gods.

49
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,650
It was found in rock, and the rock had to
be burned and broken to get the lapis lazuli

50
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,650
out.

51
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,890
That shows you how strong it is."

52
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,380
"Well, I'm sure it's too expensive for me..."

53
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,650
As Monica was about to put the necklace on
the table, the woman closed her hand around

54
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,850
Monica's, to keep the stone there.

55
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,190
"Don't let it go, now that you have it.

56
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,290
It may help you see things you never thought
were possible."

57
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,290
"But...

58
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,290
I..."

59
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,959
The woman put her finger on Monica's lips
so that she couldn't talk.

60
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,260
"Sit and listen and I will tell you the story
of the blue scarab."

61
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,290
Monica held the necklace in her hand while
the woman spoke.

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:15,480
Whether it was the heat of the room, the tea,
or the woman's soft voice, Monica began to

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,799
fall asleep.

64
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,721
"The scarab is the sacred beetle of the sun
god, the most important of all the gods as

65
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:30,010
it makes people see things in a different
way.

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,670
It is given to a different person every hundred
years.

67
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,850
The person is chosen by the sun god to act
as a messenger for the dead.

68
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,940
They see and understand things on earth that
help the gods decide whether the dead have

69
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,870
lived good or bad lives.

70
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,560
Those who wear it are sometimes frightened
because they are able to see the dead living

71
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
again.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:03,160
But they must keep the scarab, as the judgement
of so many depends on them."

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,740
Monica heard the woman's words as she slept.

74
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,590
She saw herself living thousands of years
ago, wearing the scarab.

75
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,070
People were touching her hand as she passed
them.

76
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,410
She was smiling and she felt very peaceful.

77
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,389
When she opened her eyes, she looked at the
woman talking to her.

78
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,120
"It looks good on you."

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Monica touched the necklace with her fingers.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:50,540
It was now round her neck.

81
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,949
CHAPTER TWO
Herbie

82
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,130
Monica's car had a broken headlight.

83
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:03,070
As she drove to a garage to have it fixed,
the sun came down through the trees along

84
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,389
the road, making everything seem more alive
than usual.

85
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,990
There was an old man cleaning the ground in
front of the garage when Monica parked her

86
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,990
car.

87
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,800
He had his back to her, so she called to him:

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
"Excuse me.

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,380
Do you work here?"

90
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,949
The man did not turn round.

91
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,949
"Excuse me."

92
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,850
Monica put her hand on the man's shoulder.

93
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,479
He turned quickly and Monica saw her father's
face.

94
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,450
Frightened, she put her hands over her mouth.

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,050
Her father had died five years earlier when
she was eighteen.

96
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,050
"Dad!

97
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,050
Is that you?"â€ƒ

98
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,610
Tears came to her eyes and her hands shook.

99
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:54,430
The man moved his fingers to his mouth and
ears to show her he could not speak or hear.

100
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,850
"Hello there!"

101
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:03,060
It was the voice of a young man Monica knew
from the university.

102
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,650
She had forgotten his name.

103
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,810
"It's Owen, remember?

104
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,920
We met at a party last winter."

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,680
"Oh, er yes!

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,530
I'm Monica."

107
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,060
"I suppose you' ve met Herbie.

108
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:33,860
He just started working here this morning."

109
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:42,770
Monica wouldn't look at the man, afraid of
what she would see.

110
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,920
He was talking to Owen in sign language.

111
00:07:45,920 --> 00:08:12,640
Owen spoke as he made the signs with his fingers.

112
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:36,469
"Of course you can.

113
00:08:36,469 --> 00:09:53,910
I told you, Mr Burns lets us take our lunch
whenever we want.

114
00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:35,610
As long as you've finished your work.

115
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay, you're welcome."

116
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:11,350
Herbie walked away.

117
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:51,569
Suddenly, Owen noticed Monica's necklace.

118
00:11:51,569 --> 00:12:41,799
"Is that 

119
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:52,329
a 

120
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,509
blue scarab you're wearing?"

121
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,189
"Yes, a woman at a shop gave it to me.

122
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,050
She wouldn't take any money for it."

123
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,029
"It was found in a chest believed to be the
chest of Osiris, an ancient Egyptian god.

124
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,790
I read about it in my class on ancient Egypt.

125
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,850
I study archaeology."

126
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,589
"I think I saw you leaving that class once.

127
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,240
I had an economics class right after it in
the same room."

128
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,850
"It's a small world.

129
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,739
So, what's wrong with your car?"

130
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,069
"It needs a new headlight."

131
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:19,069
"Oh, that's no problem.

132
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:20,199
I can fix that in ten minutes.

133
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,799
Why don't you go sit in the office?

134
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:27,689
While you wait, Mr Burns will write out your
bill."

135
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:33,639
In the office next to the garage, Mr Burns
sat behind his desk smoking a cigar.

136
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,470
He was a short, bald man, but Monica didn't
know how short until he stood up to shake

137
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,579
her hand.

138
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:41,799
"Nathan Burns.

139
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,589
Pleased to meet you."

140
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,189
"Monica Halloway.

141
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:46,370
Owen's fixing my headlight.

142
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,629
Er, he said you'd write up the papers."

143
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,970
"Certainly I will.

144
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,019
You just have a seat there.

145
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,819
I'll take care of it in two minutes."

146
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:58,509
Monica looked out of the office window at
Owen working on her car.

147
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:04,149
His thin, young face began to look old and
tired.

148
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:10,439
It was as if she was looking at a completely
different man and it frightened her.

149
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:12,930
Mr Burn's voice stopped her thinking.

150
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,079
"How do you spell, Halloway, with two Ls or
one?"

151
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,079
"What?

152
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,079
Oh, two.

153
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,050
H, A, double L, O, W, A, Y."

154
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,819
Monica went outside to see Owen as he finished
his work on her car.

155
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:34,300
He looked like he usually did, and Monica
forgot about what she thought she had seen

156
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
before.

157
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,149
She shook his hand.

158
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,339
"Thank you very much for your help."

159
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:40,339
"Anytime.

160
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,480
It was nice to see you again."

161
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,019
When Owen walked away, Monica saw Herbie sitting
on a chair by the garage door.

162
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,329
He was eating a sandwich.

163
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,939
She saw something on his right arm.

164
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,009
It was a purple birthmark, the same kind her
father had.

165
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,549
"It is you.

166
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,109
I knew it!"

167
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,939
She took a few steps towards Herbie, but she
frightened him.

168
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,009
He got up and went into the garage.

169
00:15:09,009 --> 00:16:18,669
When she followed him inside, she saw that
he 

170
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:28,869
had gone.

171
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:58,910
CHAPTER THREE
Tops

172
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:08,920
"Look.

173
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:40,490
If you don't stop this, you'll get yourself
into trouble.

174
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,640
It was a mistake.

175
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,450
You saw something which wasn't there,"

176
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,880
Yvonne was able to make Monica relax.

177
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,880
They ordered their pizza and began to talk
about other things when

178
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,560
Monica saw Owen across the room.

179
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,060
"Now don't tell me I don't see him.

180
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,690
That's the guy who fixed my car."

181
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,880
Owen saw them looking over at him, and he
waved hello.

182
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,550
He walked over and sat with them.

183
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,980
"I'm glad I found you."

184
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,420
"Owen, this is Yvonne."

185
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,690
"Pleased to meet you.

186
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,390
Look, I've read more about your blue scarab."

187
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,450
"Wait a minute... wait a minute!

188
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,200
I've just finished telling her that there
is no such thing as ghosts or sun gods or

189
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,180
whatever else you want to tell her."

190
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
"Yvonne, let him finish."

191
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,080
"The ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris,
the sun god's helper, used that stone so that

192
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,550
people on earth could help those who had died.

193
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,200
They thought dead people had to go through
a trial.

194
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,730
In that trial, they had to show that the good
things they had done on earth were greater

195
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,580
than the bad things.

196
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,850
Their actions could help the living improve
themselves by teaching them something.

197
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,440
If the living learn something valuable from
the life of someone else, who is now dead,

198
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,840
they can continue living their lives in a
better way.

199
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,910
This is good for the living but also for the
dead.

200
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,880
The gods will see that the dead had lived
good lives since they continue influencing

201
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
the living in a positive way."

202
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,530
"Owen, that was thousands of years ago!"

203
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,180
"Wait a minute, Yvonne.

204
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,440
Let's just try to understand this.

205
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,140
Do you think I could have seen a dead person
alive again?"

206
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,390
"I don't know about that, but I know someone
who does, and he'd like to meet you.

207
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,760
His name is Professor Lloyd.

208
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,060
He taught that class on ancient Egypt I told
you about.

209
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,910
Would you like to talk to him?"

210
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,910
"Why not?"

211
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,700
"This is mad!"

212
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,390
Monica was silent for a few minutes, because
she was thinking of her father.

213
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,320
She finally asked Owen about Herbie.

214
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,170
"Who's that old man who is working at the
garage?

215
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,990
What's his name, Herbie?"

216
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,990
"Yeah, Herbie.

217
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,190
Strange, but right after you left, we couldn't
find him.

218
00:19:44,190 --> 00:20:02,740
He never came back."

219
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:16,660
CHAPTER FOUR
Professor Lloyd

220
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,160
When Owen and Monica knocked on Professor
Lloyd's door, they heard a cat miaowing inside.

221
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,820
They heard Professor Lloyd's footsteps coming
toward the door, then they saw him: a tall

222
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,920
well-built man with glasses.

223
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,490
He had straight, grey-white hair and a soft,
kind face.

224
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,410
He welcomed them with a large smile.

225
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,210
"You must be Monica."

226
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,030
"Hello Professor Lloyd.

227
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,400
It's a pleasure to meet you."

228
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,750
"The pleasure is mine.

229
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:53,910
From what Owen tells me, you have something
which may be more powerful than we know."

230
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,920
Professor Lloyd's flat was filled with books
and cats.

231
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,250
Each wall was covered with shelves of books,
and there were cats of every different colour

232
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,560
sitting on tables, walking across the floor,
or rubbing themselves against Monica's legs.

233
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,820
Monica picked up a black one with white paws.

234
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,130
"I love your cats, Professor."

235
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,430
"The Kauri Indians of southern Peru believe
the cat spirit controls our lives.

236
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:24,410
They probably know my cats and my life."

237
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,980
Professor Lloyd laughed loudly.

238
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,160
He picked up two of the cats as they walked
to the middle of the room where a bright light

239
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,180
hung over a square white table with four chairs.

240
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,580
They sat at the table, and the professor asked
to see the blue scarab.

241
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,470
He put a round, one-inch eyepiece with black
glass over his left eye, and he studied the

242
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,350
back of the stone.

243
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,350
"Ah, yes.

244
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,170
Here are the markings."

245
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,570
The professor was quiet.

246
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,700
He took the eyepiece away from his eye and
looked at Monica.

247
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,080
Owen was worried.

248
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,260
"What is it Professor?"

249
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,160
"It seems that Monica has been chosen as a
messenger for the gods."

250
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
"Gods!

251
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,090
Professor, you don't really believe in the
gods, do you?"

252
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,610
"What I mean is that this stone is exactly
like the one in ancient mythology.

253
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,490
The myth says that certain people are chosen
to wear it."

254
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,290
"That's what the woman said who gave it to
me."

255
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,690
"Professor, what are the markings?"

256
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,380
The Professor held the stone up to the light.

257
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,442
"You can't see it clearly without the eyepiece,
but this marking here is the teeth of a dog.

258
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:41,380
The dog watches over the dead.

259
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,530
And here is the wing of a hawk.

260
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,220
The hawk cries for the revenge of the dead.

261
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,550
But here is the sign connecting all the others
- the round horn of the ram.

262
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,350
This represents the power of water.

263
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,150
It can give life to the dead.

264
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,610
The scarab on the front, which represents
the sun, acts together with water to bring

265
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,370
peace to both the living and the dead."

266
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,370
"How do you know all this?"

267
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,700
"It is written in ancient Egyptian tombs,
but there is another way to see if we are

268
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
right."

269
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
"What's that?"

270
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:42,210
"We can test the stone to see what kind of
power it has."

271
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:53,040
CHAPTER FIVE
Professor Lloyd's Back Room

272
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,600
Professor Lloyd took Owen and Monica to the
back room of his flat, where all the walls

273
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,780
were covered with black curtains.

274
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,530
In the centre of the room, there was a round,
wooden table with strange black markings on

275
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,300
it.

276
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,350
In the centre, there was a circle with the
drawing of an eye in the middle of it.

277
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:17,230
Four spears, like rays of sunlight, went from
the central circle to the edge of the table,

278
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,370
dividing the table into four equal parts.

279
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:29,130
There was another thin circle of numbers and
letters that went round the edge of the table.

280
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,890
Between the central circle and the circle
at the edge of the table there were four equal

281
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,550
spaces.

282
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:43,500
In each there was a picture: one of a fish,
one of a snake, one of the moon, and one of

283
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,980
a lotus flower.

284
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,590
Professor Lloyd lit candles in the room as
Owen and Monica sat at the table.

285
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:58,560
The professor put on a tall black hat with
a flat top, and a long black robe.

286
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,980
He was the first to speak.

287
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,780
"We are going to try to call people back from
the dead.

288
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,750
If the stone has the power the myth says it
does, we may hear voices we know."

289
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:16,160
The professor put the scarab over the eye
in the centre of the table, with the beetle

290
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,780
facing up.

291
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,700
"Now, we must all hold hands and close our
eyes.

292
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,480
Do not break the circle by letting go of the
hand of the person who is sitting next to

293
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,310
you, or the ceremony will end.

294
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,080
Relax, breathe slowly, and do not speak."

295
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,230
They were all very quiet.

296
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,410
They heard a soft whistling sound.

297
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,290
It became louder, like the sound of the wind.

298
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,780
The room became cold and all the candles were
blown out.

299
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,260
Then there were voices.

300
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,350
Wild laughing, screams of pain.

301
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,680
Then again the sound of the wind.

302
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,700
One voice spoke clearly,

303
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,260
"Jack, it's giving way!

304
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,450
The tunnel is giving way!"

305
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,500
"Uncle Bob is that you?"

306
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
"Do not speak.

307
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
They cannot hear you."

308
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,250
"Jack, the tunnel is falling!

309
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,440
Jack!"

310
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,440
The sound of an earthquake was heard and then
nothing.

311
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,670
A new voice spoke.

312
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,490
"She means alright, but it's her first holiday
on her own.

313
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,730
Let her enjoy herself."

314
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,730
"Mother.

315
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,170
It's me.

316
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,170
I'm here!"

317
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,170
"Don't speak!"

318
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,170
More wind, then rain and thunder.

319
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,210
"The boat's going over!

320
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,300
I can't hold it!"

321
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:50,290
The woman's voice screamed, then Monica screamed,

322
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,520
"Mother, no!

323
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,760
I'm here!"

324
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,320
The lights went on and Monica was standing
next to the round table where the professor

325
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,170
and Owen were sitting.

326
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,740
She ran out of the room.

327
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:14,220
The professor found her in the front room
where she was sitting on the sofa, crying.

328
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,830
He sat next to her and put his arm round her
as Owen walked nervously back and forth in

329
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,840
front of them.

330
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:28,130
"It was my mother and father on the boat trip
where they..."

331
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,350
"There, there.

332
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,170
It's over now."

333
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,360
"What was that part about my uncle calling
my father's name?"

334
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,090
"If you recognise a voice that you hear, it
means that there is something wrong between

335
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,690
you and that person.

336
00:27:41,690 --> 00:28:01,420
One thing is certain, the scarab is real."

337
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:10,100
CHAPTER SIX
Monica's Father Speaks

338
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,020
Yvonne drove Monica back to the Cairo gift
shop so she could return the blue scarab to

339
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,390
the gypsy woman.

340
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,020
She did not want the necklace after that night
at Professor Lloyd's.

341
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,780
Her parents had both died on a boating holiday
and hearing their voices again had really

342
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,180
frightened her.

343
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:40,600
They parked the car near what they thought
was the shop's window.

344
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,491
The window was old and dirty.

345
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:48,850
There was no sign with Cairo written on it.

346
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,780
The door had wooden boards in front of it.

347
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,670
"I think it was here."

348
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,210
Yvonne looked around the street to see if
they had made a mistake.

349
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:06,900
Monica wiped the dust off one of the store
windows with a tissue so she could see inside.

350
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,520
The inside had pieces of wood hanging from
the ceiling.

351
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,690
There were old boards, stones and dirt all
over the floor.

352
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,190
It looked as if it hadn't been used for a
long time.

353
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,910
Then, Monica saw it.

354
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:28,750
Hanging from the ceiling, there was one of
the brightly coloured paper animals.

355
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,750
It was a bright blue scarab.

356
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,120
Monica ran to the car.

357
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,830
"Let's get out of here."

358
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,830
"What's wrong?

359
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,020
What's happened?"

360
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,340
Yvonne got in the car, but Monica couldn't
tell her what happened.

361
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,941
"Just drive me to the university.

362
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,060
I'm not keeping this scarab."

363
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,310
"What are you going to do with it?"

364
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,590
"Give it to Professor Lloyd."

365
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,140
Yvonne left Monica at the university, where
Professor Lloyd had an office on the top floor

366
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,400
of the library.

367
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,830
Monica knocked on the door.

368
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,710
"Yes?"

369
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,040
Monica opened the door.

370
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
"Professor Lloyd?"

371
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,120
"Monica, my dear!

372
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Come in.

373
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Come in."

374
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Monica remembered the woman in the shop saying
something similar.

375
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,770
She took the necklace out of her bag and put
it on the professor's desk.

376
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,730
The sun was shining through the window.

377
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,420
It hit the scarab.

378
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,120
When Professor Lloyd spoke, he had Monica's
father's voice.

379
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,200
"Monica, don't be afraid."

380
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,150
Monica covered her mouth with her hands.

381
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,400
"It's okay, dear.

382
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,530
I need to talk to you.

383
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:47,460
I know I was angry at you for not going with
us on that boating trip, but you mustn't feel

384
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,080
bad about it.

385
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
You lived.

386
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,950
Now we need your help.

387
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,270
Keep the necklace.

388
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,380
Live the best life possible.

389
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,980
That will help us now."

390
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,750
The professor stopped talking, then he walked
to the window.

391
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,350
Monica sat looking at the scarab.

392
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,540
She wasn't frightened.

393
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,380
In fact, she felt very happy and calm.

394
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,890
"What does it mean, Professor?"

395
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,130
He did not turn to look at her.

396
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,770
He spoke with his own voice this time.

397
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:24,870
"If you live a good life, you forgive others
and try to help those you can.

398
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,630
This has a great effect, because it shows
that you have learned something from other

399
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,740
people's lives.

400
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:36,840
By doing this you will be able to teach others
who will live after you have died."

401
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,210
She put the scarab around her neck.

402
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,040
The professor continued.

403
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,290
"The fact that you were chosen to wear the
scarab means you can do more than others.

404
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,290
You can help many."

405
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,370
"Really, Professor?

406
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,179
But how can this be done?"

407
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,210
"We all have people we have loved and who
are now dead.

408
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,030
We want their lives to be judged fairly."

409
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,929
The professor never turned away from the window.

410
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:14,170
Before Monica left, he said two more words
to her.

411
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:27,270
"Thank you."

412
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:39,960
CHAPTER SEVEN
Osiris and Seth

413
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,270
Owen was reading a book about Egyptian gods.

414
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:51,240
It said that Osiris, the one who judges those
who die, was once a king.

415
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,340
His brother Seth wanted to be king, so he
played a trick on Osiris.

416
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,700
He brought him a beautiful, large chest, and
he told the king that he could have the chest

417
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,000
if he could fit inside it.

418
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,740
After the king lay down in the chest, Seth
quickly closed it, threw it into the Nile

419
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,540
river, and it sailed out to sea.

420
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,720
Owen put the book down, because he began thinking
of his own father's death.

421
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,670
His father had been killed at an archaeological
site.

422
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:31,270
He was a famous archaeologist, which is why
Owen wanted to be one.

423
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,140
Owen's uncle was with Owen's father when he
died.

424
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,380
He came to live with Owen and his mother afterwards,
and Owen had always thought his uncle didn't

425
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,740
care about his father's death.

426
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:50,100
He never talked about him and he behaved as
if he were Owen's father.

427
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,120
The voice he heard at the professor's suddenly
meant something to him.

428
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,330
He felt he had to talk to Monica.

429
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:03,800
He remembered where she lived, because he
had driven her home from the professor's.

430
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:12,639
He hoped she wasn't asleep.

431
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,419
Monica was asleep when she heard the loud
knocking at her door.

432
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:17,960
It frightened her.

433
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,359
"Who is it?"

434
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,359
"It's me, Owen.

435
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,359
Could you open the door?

436
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,769
I have to talk to you!"

437
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,869
Owen looked awful.

438
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:29,380
He held his books tightly in his arms and
his hair stood up on his head as if he had

439
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,499
been pulling at it.

440
00:34:30,499 --> 00:34:32,239
"Can I come in?

441
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,210
I've got something really important to talk
to you about."

442
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:41,690
"Yes, come in, but calm down."

443
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,970
Monica made them some hot chocolate while
Owen told her what he had read.

444
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,980
"I still don't understand what that story
has to do with your uncle."

445
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,020
"That was my uncle's voice we heard at Professor
Lloyd's.

446
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,869
I know it's wrong, but I always thought my
uncle had something to do with my father's

447
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:57,869
death.

448
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,869
He never talked about it."

449
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,220
"But that has nothing to do with the scarab."

450
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,759
"It does.

451
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:05,749
Don't you remember Professor Lloyd telling
us about the markings on the back?"

452
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:06,749
"Yes."

453
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:09,269
"Well, one of those marks was the ram's horn.

454
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:12,700
It's the sign of water, which connects all
the other signs.

455
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,540
Osiris was killed by water.

456
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,630
He looks after the dead, that's why there
arc the markings of the dog's teeth."

457
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,489
"And the hawk's wing?"

458
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,630
"Osiris' son, Horus, killed his uncle for
his lather.

459
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,650
When Horus died, he became the hawk god who
sits by his father when he judges the dead

460
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,930
and cries for them."

461
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,269
Monica touched the scarab around her neck.

462
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:38,910
She knew that she and Owen had been brought
together for some reason.

463
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,619
Maybe she could do something for him.

464
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,680
Owen was holding his cup of hot chocolate,
thinking very hard.

465
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,250
Finally, he spoke.

466
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,810
"I think I should go and talk to my uncle."

467
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,660
"He would probably like that."

468
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,589
"I haven't spoken to him in five years."

469
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,480
"Would you like me to go with you?"

470
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:10,690
He looked at Monica.

471
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:22,040
"Yes."

472
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:30,470
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Gloves

473
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,760
Owen's uncle was painting the front of his
house when Monica and Owen drove up the dirt

474
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,799
road.

475
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:41,480
He pushed back his cap to get a better look,
and seemed very surprised when he saw who

476
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,369
it was.

477
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,680
Owen held out his hand.

478
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,069
"Hello, uncle Bob."

479
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,539
They shook hands, then hugged.

480
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:53,160
"You're the last person in the world I expected
to see coming up that road today."

481
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,309
"Well, I thought, it was time I paid a visit
to say hello."

482
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:03,010
Uncle Bob's blue eyes were bright with happiness
as he looked into his nephew's eyes.

483
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,690
He looked over at Monica.

484
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,890
"I'm sorry.

485
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,210
This is my friend, Monica."

486
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,710
"How do you do?"

487
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,890
"Nice to meet you, sir."

488
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,450
They all went and sat on the back porch which
looked onto a huge empty field surrounded

489
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,079
by trees.

490
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,420
Uncle Bob brought them some lemonade.

491
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:26,579
A large friendly dog lay next to Monica's
chair and she lightly scratched its head.

492
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:31,559
"Do you two mind if I take a walk with my
new friend here?"

493
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:37,609
The men didn't answer, so Monica ran down
the porch steps into the field with the dog

494
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:38,829
following her.

495
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:43,829
"Uncle Bob, what happened the day my father
died?"

496
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:49,829
His uncle stopped talking and looked at the
long empty field in front of him.

497
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:52,519
Monica had disappeared somewhere with the
dog.

498
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,619
"We never really talked about that, did we?

499
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:56,710
But maybe it's time."

500
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,400
"I never understood why you never mentioned
his name alter he died."

501
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,680
His uncle looked over at him.

502
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,529
"Owen, some things hurt too much to talk about."

503
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:11,039
"Do you think you could talk about it now?"

504
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,269
"I could try.

505
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:17,970
You see, there was this big earthquake two
days before we went down in the tunnel.

506
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,380
I told your father there would be another
one, but he..."

507
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,849
His uncle was having trouble telling this
part.

508
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:26,660
"...but he wouldn't listen.

509
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,279
It was our last day, and he wanted to go.

510
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:35,160
When it hit, I was up above cleaning some
of the pieces we'd found."

511
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,109
Owen could see it happening.

512
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:43,799
He didn't even notice that his uncle had got
up to go inside.

513
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:49,040
He heard the back door open, and then he saw
his uncle standing next to him, holding an

514
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,910
old pair of gloves.

515
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:57,789
"Your father gave these to me the day he died
because I had left mine at home.

516
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:00,849
He wore them every time he went out to dig.

517
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:06,390
I think he'd have wanted you to have them."

518
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,190
Owen held the gloves in his hands.

519
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,550
He put them on.

520
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,300
There were tears in his eyes.

521
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,430
His uncle put his arm around him.

522
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:23,940
Soon after Monica returned from her walk,
she and Owen got ready to leave.

523
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:33,069
They promised uncle Bob they would come back
again soon.

524
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:43,569
As they drove away, Monica beeped the horn
twice.

525
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:47,359
In the car, Owen was quiet.

526
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,710
Monica saw the gloves in his hand, but she
didn't ask him about them.

527
00:39:52,710 --> 00:40:21,989
That was between Owen, his uncle and his father.

528
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:24,470
CHAPTER NINE
Cemetery

529
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:35,599
After leaving Owen's uncle, Monica did something
Owen didn't expect.

530
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,869
She drove the car into a cemetery.

531
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,829
"Where are we going?"

532
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,119
"My parents were buried here.

533
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,979
I want to see their gravestones."

534
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:53,759
They parked the car in the visitors' car park,
then walked.

535
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:56,270
The sun was very bright.

536
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,789
They were walking through a field of white
crosses and gravestones.

537
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:03,260
They stopped to look at some of the older
ones.

538
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,069
"Look at this one, 1826."

539
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:08,410
"And this one is from 1905.

540
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,579
Michael Mason.

541
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:13,470
Look, his wife died a year later."

542
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,499
"I think I like archaeology because of the
connection between two periods of time.

543
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:23,780
I mean, when I understand the way someone
lived hundreds of years ago, I understand

544
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,920
more about the way we live now."

545
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,450
Monica took Owen's hand and walked with him
to her parents' graves.

546
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,460
"They were never buried here.

547
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,020
We just have the graves to remember them.

548
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,359
They died at sea.

549
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,509
Their bodies were never found."

550
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:45,630
Monica took a jar of water from her coat pocket.

551
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,229
She poured some of it over each of her parents'
gravestones.

552
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:50,650
"What's that?"

553
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,910
"It's water I took from the sea.

554
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:59,089
I was at my parents' funeral, but I never
felt like I said goodbye.

555
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:04,590
This is something I thought of doing to let
them know that everything is okay."

556
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,900
"Was there a problem between you and your
parents?"

557
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,710
"Well, my father loved our family holidays.

558
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,880
The summer they died was the first time I
hadn't gone with them.

559
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,670
Some friends of mine had a beach house.

560
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,799
I was eighteen.

561
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:21,539
I wanted to be with my friends.

562
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,920
My dad and I had a big fight.

563
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,259
We didn't talk to each other before he left
on their boat trip.

564
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,410
I felt guilty about that.

565
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:36,509
In fact, I never forgave myself, until I began
to believe in this scarab."

566
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:39,020
She touched the stone on her neck.

567
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,319
"You think your father will somehow feel that
your argument meant nothing compared to how

568
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:45,989
much you loved each other?"

569
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,140
"Something like that.

570
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,799
All the things I've seen and heard since I
got the scarab have given me hope.

571
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,460
I would like to believe that I live a better
life now because of the good things done by

572
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,109
the people who lived before me.

573
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:02,319
It does justify their life.

574
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,799
If what the ancient Egyptians said was true,
I mean the fact that people's lives are judged

575
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:13,750
after they die, then I believe it's our duty
to show the gods that those who died did help

576
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,160
us by their good actions.

577
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,170
It's a good reason to do the best you can."

578
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:26,260
As Owen and Monica walked back to the car
in the bright golden sunlight, they looked

579
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,120
like two dark figures slowly disappearing
into the distance.

580
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
CHAPTER TEN
The Blue Scarab

581
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
Monica was sitting in the living room of Owen's
Hat, waiting for him.

582
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
He had gone to use a neighbour's telephone
because his was out of order.

583
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
She found a book on the table next to her.

584
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
It was a library book on ancient Egypt.

585
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
She opened it to the story of Osiris and began
to read:

586
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
After Seth had thrown the chest, with Osiris
inside, into the Nile, Osiris' wife, his,

587
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,120
went to look for it.

588
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
She found the chest, but before she could
open it and bury the body, Seth stole it from

589
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
her.

590
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,120
He cut the body into sixteen separate pieces
and hid them all over Egypt.

591
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
Again, Isis went to look for them.

592
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
This time, she took her sister, Nephthys,
with her.

593
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Together they found each piece.

594
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Isis had magical powers.

595
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
She put the body back together with a special
oil.

596
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
"This oil is from the tree of healing.

597
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
It will keep the body after it is buried.

598
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
This white cloth that I will put around him
will let the gods know that he was a great

599
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,120
king."

600
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
The gods liked what Isis had done, and they
rewarded Osiris.

601
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
"Osiris will decide on the life of the dead.

602
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
If someone is good and just, they will be
rewarded.

603
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Those who are evil and do not respect others'
lives will be punished."

604
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
So, Osiris was made the judge of the dead.

605
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
When somebody died, their soul, which left
their body, was put through forty-two tests.

606
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,120
After these tests, the soul was brought before
Osiris.

607
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,120
Osiris sat in front of a pair of scales.

608
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
He held a feather in his hand.

609
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
Next to him there was a man with a dog's head
and a man with the head of a falcon.

610
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,120
Osiris held the feather out to the dog's head.

611
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,120
"Anubis, take this feather and place it on
one end of the scale.

612
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
It is the feather of truth.

613
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
It will tell us who has lived a just life
and who has not."

614
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Osiris then spoke to the falcon head.

615
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
"Horus, you are my son.

616
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
You tried to find revenge for my death by
killing your uncle.

617
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Take the soul and put it on the opposite end
of the scale.

618
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
There you will cry for its revenge."

619
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,120
The falcon head walked to the scale opposite
the dog's head.

620
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
They held each scale until Osiris told them
to let them go.

621
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
"This soul has passed through the forty-two
tests.

622
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
These tests were given to decide if your good
deeds in life are greater than your bad ones.

623
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
You have not passed these tests alone.

624
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
People who are living have acted for you.

625
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Now, it is time to see.

626
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Have you lived a good and just life?

627
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Let go of the scales."

628
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
The falcon and dog let go of the scales.

629
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,120
The falcon made a loud cry.

630
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
The scales balanced.

631
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Osiris held up the blue scarab.

632
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
"This is what we will use to speak to the
living.

633
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
Through this the souls of the dead will be
judged.

634
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
We hope that the living will understand what
we say."

635
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
"Now, I understand."

636
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Monica closed the book and put it back on
the table.

637
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
She walked to the window and looked outside.

638
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Everything was bathed in the sunlight.

639
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
She touched the scarab round her neck and
closed her eyes.

640
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
She said to herself softly, "Now, I understand."

641
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,122
- THE END -
