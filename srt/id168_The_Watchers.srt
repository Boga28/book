CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:27,960
The big caves

3
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,680
My name is Taras.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,120
I am old...

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,480
3,000 years old.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,400
I sit here, under the Palace of Knossos.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,200
My sister, Aketa, sits next to me.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,240
She, too, is old.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,200
3,000 years.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,600
We do not eat, we do not drink, 
and our eyes never close.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,000
Are we dead, or alive?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,840
It is not important.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,240
We sit, and we wait.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,920
And we watch.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,040
For 3,000 years.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,080
We are the Watchers.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
The god is here, too.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,480
The god Poseidon, god of the 
sea, stands here in this hall.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,400
We watch his statue.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,000
It is gold, all gold.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,480
He stands here, five meters tall.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,920
His arms are gold, his hair 
is gold, his face is gold.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,400
And his gold eyes shine in this dark hall.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:44,240
We are his Watchers.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,600
Jim and Stella, his sister, 
are on holiday in Greece.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,040
They are staying at a hotel in Iraklion, on Crete.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,520
They are talking to their friend, Nikos.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,840
Nikos is a Cretan and lives 
near the Palace of Knossos.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,400
'What are we going to do 
tomorrow? Can we go to Knossos?'

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,040
'Yes.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,960
Why not? It's a very famous place.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,680
And very, very old.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,000
About 3,000 or 4,000 years old.'

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,480
'Yes, I'd like to...'

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
'Stella! Look at this.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,800
If's about Knossos.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,781
It's very interesting.'

38
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:21,791
CRETE NEWS

39
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:21,800
10 August

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Caves Under Knossos Iraklion, Crete

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,960
UNDER the famous Palace of 
Knossos there are many caves.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,240
Some of these caves are very big, and some 
are many, many meters under the ground.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,040
What is in these caves?

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,760
Nobody knows The caves are very dangerous.

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Next week Yannis Papadakis is going to...

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,400
'We're going to find these caves, 
Stella! Are you coming with us, Nikos?'

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
'But Jim...'

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,120
'Yes, yes, I'm coming with you.

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,920
You can stay with me at my 
mother's house near Knossos.'

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
'Good.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,880
We're going to need a lot of things.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,680
Lights.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,480
And food and water.

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
And we need...'

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
'Yes, but it's OK.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,880
I can get everything.

57
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,840
'Jim, the caves are dangerous.'

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,640
'Yes, but Nikos knows a lot about caves.'

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,240
'Yes, I do.

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,200
And I know the Palace of Knossos very well.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
Don't forget...

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
I work there!'

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,160
'But do you know these caves under Knossos?'

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,800
'No, I don't.

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,320
But we're going to be careful.'

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,840
'Oh, all right.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,000
When are we going?'

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,040
'Tomorrow!'

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,960
Sometimes there are lights in these halls.

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,640
And music.

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,440
The people from the Palace come down here.

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,760
They are small, quick people, 
with dark eyes and dark hair.

73
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,320
They bring lights, and food, and water...

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,560
and they dance the dance of the god.

75
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,840
They are the god's people.

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,920
No, no, I forget...

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,040
They do not come now.

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,120
These halls are quiet...

79
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,960
dark and quiet.

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,320
It is always night now.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,840
There is no music, no dancing.

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,480
There are no people in the Palace now...

83
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,800
not after the fire and the water from the sea.

84
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
They are dead...

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,840
all dead.

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,800
And we, Aketa and I, sit in the hall of the god.

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,880
We wait and we watch.

88
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,920
We are the god's Watchers.

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,840
CHAPTER TWO

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,720
The first day

91
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,320
At the palace of Knossos.

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,160
It is seven o'clock in the morning.

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,560
Nikos is looking for the door to the caves.

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,200
Jim and Stella are waiting for him.

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,120
The sun is hot.

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
'I'm thirsty.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm going to drink some water.'

98
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,560
'Don't drink a lot.

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,440
We need it in the caves.'

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,920
'Have we got everything?'

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,280
'I think so.

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,240
The bags are very heavy.'

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:28,160
'Jim! Stella! The door's here! 
Come on, we can go down now.'

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,720
'Be careful!'

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
'It's very dark.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
I can't see anything.'

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,360
'Here, hold this light.

108
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,800
We need all the lights now.'

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
'Walk slowly.

110
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,880
And be very careful.'

111
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,000
'Yes, I know!'

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,440
'How many caves are there? 
This is the tenth cave now.'

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,120
'I can see another one in front of us.

114
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,400
A long one.'

115
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,960
'I'm tired.

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't want to look at any more caves today.'

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,720
'How about some food? I'm hungry.'

118
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,840
'Yes, let's eat something.

119
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,880
And we can stay here for the night.'

120
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,080
'Good! Where's the bag? The food is in there.'

121
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,480
'How old are these caves, Nikos?'

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,160
'I don't know.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
3,000 years? 4,000 years?'

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,280
'Do many people come to these caves?'

125
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,680
'Not many people, no.

126
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,800
Only the old Greek gods.

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,160
The god Poseidon lives in caves, some people say.'

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,600
'The god Poseidon! There are 
no old gods in these caves.'

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,320
'How do you know, Jim?'

130
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,040
'The old Greek gods are only stories.

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,880
You read about them in books.

132
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,800
They're not important today.'

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
'Oh yes, they are.

134
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,920
Don't laugh at them.

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,680
And Poseidon is a dangerous god.

136
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,560
All the books say that.

137
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,080
He's the god of the sea, and 
the god of earthquakes, too.

138
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,360
We have a lot of earthquakes in Greece.

139
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
Don't forget that.'

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,040
'Oh Nikos! That's silly! The god of earthquakes? 
Everybody knows that earthquakes...'

141
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,080
'No, Jim.

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Nikos is right.

143
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,240
We don't understand everything.

144
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,440
And don't laugh at Poseidon...

145
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,640
not here in these caves.'

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,000
The years come, and the years go.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,480
3,000 years.

148
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,240
My sister Aketa and I sit...

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
and wait.

150
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,400
It is dark and cold in the hall of the god.

151
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
The sun never shines here.

152
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,200
Sometimes people come to these halls.

153
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,360
They are not the god's people.

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,800
They look for gold, only gold.

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,640
And Poseidon is angry.

156
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,360
It is the gold of his people...

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,760
and now it is the god's gold, 
because his people are dead.

158
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,320
Nobody can take the god's gold, or 
look at the gold face of the god...

159
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,960
and live.

160
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,840
But there are no lights, no people now.

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,360
Only the god Poseidon stands here in 
this dark hall - god of the blue sea,  

162
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,040
god of the green sea, god of this dark hall.

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:29,440
We are his Watchers.

164
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
CHAPTER  

165
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,720
THREE

166
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,200
The second day

167
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
'Wake up, Stella.

168
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
Good morning, Nikos!

169
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,640
'Morning? It's always night in 
these caves! What's the time?'

170
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,040
'Seven o'clock.

171
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
Are we going on...

172
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
or back?'

173
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
'What do you think, Nikos?

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
'Mmm.

175
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
I don't know.

176
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,520
How many caves are there? 
Fifteen? Twenty? I don't know.

177
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,560
But we can look at the next...

178
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
or two.'

179
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,160
'Or three, or four, or five.

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,560
I know you, Jim.

181
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,080
You want to see everything.'

182
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
'This is the fourteenth cave.

183
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,880
And this cave is big, very big.'

184
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,040
'Look! This is a road.

185
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,360
We're walking on a road!'

186
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
'Yes, you're right.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,920
It's a very old road, too.

188
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,400
Look at these stones on the floor.

189
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,880
They're thousands of years old.'

190
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,560
'But whose road is it? And where does it go to?'

191
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,440
'I don't know, but we can follow it.'

192
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,640
'But it's six o'clock now.

193
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,240
I think...'

194
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,200
'Listen! I can hear water.

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,920
Can you hear it? There's a river in front of us.'

196
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,840
'We can't get across a river!'

197
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,560
'Oh yes, we can!'

198
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,480
'I don't want to go across.

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,680
It's dangerous.'

200
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,840
'No, it isn't.

201
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,600
Come on, Stella!'

202
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,560
'Stella's right.

203
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Rivers under the ground are dangerous, but...'

204
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,080
'Listen! I can hear something...'

205
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
'It's only the river, Stella.

206
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
It's all right.

207
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,000
We can go across the river, and then we 
can stop and stay there for the night.'

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
'Yes.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,320
We can make a fire, and have some food.'

210
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
Listen, sister.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,080
Do you hear anything?

212
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,120
There are people at the river.

213
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,680
They are talking and laughing.

214
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Listen, sister.

215
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,320
They are coming here...

216
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
to the hall of the god.

217
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
Why?

218
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,960
Who are they?

219
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,680
What do they want?

220
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Gold...

221
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
They want gold.

222
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,680
All people want gold.

223
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,960
They cannot eat it, they cannot drink it.

224
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,120
But the love of gold is in all men...

225
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
and women, too.

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,440
But they cannot take the god's gold.

227
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
We are his Watchers.

228
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,840
We call the god, and we say his name.

229
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,280
Then the god wakes...

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:29,240
and he speaks.

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
CHAPTER FOUR

232
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,120
The third day

233
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,000
'When are we going to go back? 
This is the third day now.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,320
I don't like these caves.'

235
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,120
'Why not, Stella?'

236
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,960
'I don't know.

237
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,040
I can hear something...

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
or someone.

239
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,480
It's not the river.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,840
I want to go back, Nikos.'

241
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
'Yes.

242
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Sometimes I can hear something, too.

243
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
But there's nobody in these caves, Stella.

244
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,000
Only us.'

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,440
'Let's look at one more cave.

246
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,040
Then we can go back.

247
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,440
OK?'

248
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,920
'What's Jim doing?'

249
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
'I don't know.

250
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
He's looking at something.

251
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,640
Jim, what are you...?'

252
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,440
'Hey! Look at this! It's a bowl...

253
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
a gold bowl.'

254
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,800
'It's beautiful.

255
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,160
Can I hold it for a minute? It's very heavy, too.

256
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,920
Look at all this gold!'

257
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,480
'Is it old, Nikos?'

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,440
'Yes, thousands of years old, I think.'

259
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,840
'We can sell it - we can get 
a lot of money for this bowl.'

260
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,480
'We can't do that! It's not ours.'

261
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,400
'Whose is it, then?'

262
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
'It's, well, it's...

263
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,040
I don't know.

264
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,520
But it's not ours!'

265
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,840
'Don't take it, Jim.

266
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,880
Leave it here.'

267
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,680
'No, I'm going to take it.

268
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,160
It's ours now.'

269
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,800
'Can you hear them, sister? 
They are near the hall now.

270
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
Listen...

271
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,240
They are looking for gold...

272
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,720
gold.

273
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,840
All people want gold.'

274
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,280
'Look at that next cave.

275
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,320
Can you see it? It's huge.'

276
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
'It's not a cave...

277
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,000
it's a hall...

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
a huge hall.'

279
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,920
'Jim, Nikos, don't go in there!'

280
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,360
'Why not, Stella?'

281
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,960
'I think someone is watching us.

282
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't like it.'

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,320
'Why don't we go back? Please!'

284
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,940
'Who is watching us? We're the only people here.

285
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,480
Stella I don't know.

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,120
But someone, or something, is watching us.

287
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,600
And it doesn't like us.'

288
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
'Don't be silly, Stella.

289
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,080
Nothing is watching us.

290
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,560
Come on.'

291
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,280
'I can see them now, sister.

292
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,240
Two men and a woman.

293
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,800
They are young.

294
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,480
Two of them have blue eyes...

295
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
They are not people from the Palace.'

296
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,520
'They are not the god's people.

297
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,720
And they cannot come in here.

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,480
They cannot take the god's gold.'

299
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:17,040
'They cannot look at the face of the god.'

300
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,640
'Look at those statues there.

301
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,040
They're very, very old.

302
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,520
They're...'

303
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,920
'I don't like them.

304
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,040
Look at their eyes! Come away, Stella.'

305
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,640
'I can see something at the end of the hall.'

306
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,840
'Look! What is it? It's tall...

307
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,640
very tall.

308
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,800
It's a statue, a huge statue...

309
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,720
and it's shining.

310
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,200
It's gold - all gold!'

311
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
'Don't look at it.

312
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
Don't go in there.

313
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,800
Please, Jim, please! It's dangerous.

314
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,880
Stop him, Nikos.

315
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,320
Stop him.'

316
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,840
'They are looking into the hall now.

317
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,040
Call the god!'

318
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:07,360
'Now, sister, now! Say the name 
of the god! They cannot come in...

319
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,480
They cannot come in...'

320
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
'Shh, be quiet for a minute.

321
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
Wait, Jim.

322
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,840
Listen.'

323
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
'Why? What's...'

324
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,200
'Shh! I think Stella's right.

325
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,280
There's something...'

326
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,800
'Listen! Nikos, what's that? Can you hear it?'

327
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
'Oh no! No! The ground is moving...

328
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,000
It's an earthquake! There's going to be an 
earthquake! The stones are falling! Run...

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,560
Run!

330
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,760
Back to the river...

331
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,280
Run!'

332
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,160
'Quick, Stella! Run...

333
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Run!'

334
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,520
'We can't! The walls are falling...

335
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:58,920
Everything is falling! We can't 
get out! We can't get out!'

336
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,280
CRETE NEWS 14 august

337
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,120
Earthquake at Knossos-

338
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,400
Three Young People are Dead

339
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,440
Iraklion, Crete

340
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,720
Anna Stavros, mother of Nikos Stavros, 
says: 'Nikos and his two English friends,  

341
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Jim and Stella, are in the caves 
under the Palace of Knossos.

342
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,840
But where is the door to the caves?

343
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,080
Nobody can find it now after the earthquake.

344
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,560
My son and his friends cannot get out.

345
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
They are dead.'

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,360
The god Poseidon, god of the sea, is angry.

347
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,600
He speaks, and the ground 
moves, and the stones fall.

348
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
But the god can sleep again now, sister.

349
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
The men and the woman are quiet.

350
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,440
They cannot move.

351
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,040
They lie under the stones.

352
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,640
They hold the god's gold bowl in their hands, 
but they cannot go back across the river.

353
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,200
And they cannot look at the face of the god.

354
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,880
The god's gold eyes shine in this dark hall.

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,840
We are his Watchers...
