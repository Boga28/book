00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,270
CHAPTER ONE
The Earth's climate

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:14,719
Today, the Earth's climate has a huge effect
on the daily lives of all the people in the

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,400
world.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:25,380
It has always had a big effect on life on
Earth, and it had a big effect on how life

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,089
started billions of years ago.

6
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:34,239
So, what is climate?

7
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:44,780
Climate is the usual weather in a place over
a long time - normally thirty years or more.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,500
Weather can change quickly, and a place can
have very different weather from one day to

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,550
the next.

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,399
But climate is those weather patterns over
a long time.

11
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:09,580
On Earth, lots of things have an effect on
the climate - the atmosphere, the oceans,

12
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:20,340
the land, ice, people, plants and animals,
and the light and heat from the Sun.

13
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,080
The Earth's atmosphere is a thin layer of
gases above the Earth.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,710
The Earth's atmosphere

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:41,330
Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen (N2) and
oxygen (O2), but there are other gases in

16
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,750
the atmosphere, too.

17
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:52,780
Some of the gases in the atmosphere are called
greenhouse gases because, like the glass in

18
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,200
a greenhouse, they keep the Earth warm.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,340
They do this by stopping some of the Sun's
heat from leaving the Earth.

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,819
They are very important because they help
to keep the Earth at the right temperature

21
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:18,909
for life to grow - not too hot and not too
cold.

22
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:26,550
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important greenhouse
gas.

23
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,480
Without the greenhouse gases, the Earth would
be very, very cold.

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,040
Many scientists study the Earth's atmosphere.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,480
They do this from satellites and from the
land, and their studies show that the amount

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,230
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is growing.

27
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:59,519
This is making the temperature on Earth get
warmer, and this warming is having a big effect

28
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:08,060
on the climate.

29
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,109
We are already seeing the effects of this
all over the world.

30
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:22,590
Weather patterns are changing; the water in
the oceans is getting warner; snow and ice

31
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:31,440
are melting in the Arctic and Antarctica;
and sea levels are increasing.

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,920
These effects can cause many problems for
the people on Earth, and for the beautiful

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,049
plants and animals that live on Earth, too.

34
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:50,379
They could mean there is not enough food and
water for everyone; they could have a damaging

35
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:57,950
effect on people's health; and they could
make some people poorer.

36
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:07,189
We need to act now to stop climate change
and to make a better future for our world.

37
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:16,410
If we do not act now, we will put the future
of our world in danger.

38
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,950
CHAPTER TWO
A warmer world

39
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:29,030
Weather stations across the world give us
information about the temperature on the Earth's

40
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,340
surface.

41
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,490
We also get information from ships and buoys
in the oceans.

42
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:46,810
All this information helps scientists to decide
if the temperature on Earth is going up or

43
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,090
going down.

44
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:57,360
Information from the last 150 years shows
that the temperature on the Earth's surface

45
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,870
has gone up.

46
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:07,480
The temperature in some places has increased
more than others, and the warming in the Arctic

47
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,140
is greater than in all other places on Earth.

48
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:22,260
Some years have always been warmer or colder
than others, and the Earth's climate has changed

49
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,170
a number of times in the past.

50
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:33,400
This is because natural things can cause the
Earth's temperature to change from one year

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,470
to the next, or to change over a longer time.

52
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:47,870
These things include the amount of heat coming
from the Sun, the effect of volcanoes and

53
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,700
weather patterns like El Nino.

54
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:59,920
But, for many years, scientists have talked
about climate change and the warming of the

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Earth.

56
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:14,210
Each of the past four decades has been warmer
than the one before.

57
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:21,520
The information we get from weather stations,
ships and buoys shows that, since the year

58
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:34,120
2000, the Earth's temperature has been 0.75
degrees Celsius warmer than it was 150 years

59
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,680
ago.

60
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:45,960
But, in 2015, the temperature became 1 degree
Celsius warmer than 150 years ago.

61
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,940
This is a big increase, and scientists are
worried about it.

62
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,430
Other studies also show that the Earth is
getting warmer.

63
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:06,720
For example, studies show that the temperature
of the oceans is increasing - from the surface,

64
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,460
right down to the bottom of each ocean.

65
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,720
Other studies show that the amount of snow
and ice on the Earth's surface is getting

66
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,620
smaller.

67
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,390
Melting ice and increasing sea levels

68
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:32,830
The warming of the Earth is causing the Arctic
sea ice to melt.

69
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:40,920
In the 2010s, at the end of the summer, the
Arctic sea ice was one third smaller than

70
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,720
at the end of the 20th century.

71
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:54,490
That's a change of the same size as the UK,
Ireland, France, Spain, Germany and Italy

72
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,080
put together.

73
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,610
When the Arctic sea ice melts, it can change
the weather patterns in Europe, Asia and North

74
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,170
America.

75
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:13,710
As the Earth gets warmer, the water in the
oceans gets warmer, too.

76
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,930
This makes the water expand get larger.

77
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,210
This makes sea levels increase.

78
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:31,750
Also, the land ice in Greenland and Antarctica
is melting, and this, too, causes sea levels

79
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,810
to increase.

80
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:41,279
Studies show that sea levels across the world
are increasing.

81
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:48,279
When sea levels increase, floods from storms
can be more dangerous for people living near

82
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,680
the sea.

83
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:59,660
Many of the world's biggest cities, like Shanghai
in China, Jakarta in Indonesia and Mumbai

84
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,050
in India, are very close to the sea.

85
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,560
Higher sea levels put these cities in danger
of floods.

86
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:18,560
The floods in New York City in 2012 showed
the damage that big storms can do.

87
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,389
These floods caused huge problems for the
people of New York City.

88
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:32,750
They damaged homes and other buildings, and
many people had no electricity in their homes.

89
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:39,860
This meant no heat, no light and no way to
cook food or heat water.

90
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:47,930
The damage caused by big storms can have an
effect for many years and can cost billions

91
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,370
of pounds.

92
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:59,449
For now, the Thames Barrier on the River Thames
in London protects the city from floods, but,

93
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:05,180
if sea levels increase, the barrier might
need to be bigger.

94
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,620
And many other cities across the world do
not have anything to protect them from higher

95
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,930
sea levels and the floods they can cause.

96
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:23,079
The warming of the Earth puts all of these
cities in danger.

97
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:31,160
In many places, building a barrier like the
Thames Barrier is either not possible or too

98
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,009
expensive.

99
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,990
CHAPTER THREE
The effects of a warmer world

100
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,220
Heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms

101
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:51,920
Heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms are
all extreme weather.

102
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:01,250
A heatwave is very hot weather for many days,
and a drought is very little rain for a long

103
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,300
time.

104
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:12,689
Extreme weather can cause huge damage to buildings
and roads, and to people and animals.

105
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:20,560
The damage caused by extreme weather can cost
billions of pounds, and many people can lose

106
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,440
their lives.

107
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:29,399
In 2016, there was an extreme heatwave in
India.

108
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:39,180
The country had its highest-ever temperature
at 51 degrees Celsius, and many people died.

109
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:48,570
In Europe in 2003, there was a summer heatwave
that killed tens of thousands of people.

110
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:55,779
Most of these people were old, because very
hot weather can cause more problems for older

111
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,899
people.

112
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:04,850
In Australia, there have been many large fires
over the last few years.

113
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:13,350
In the Australian summer, the land, and the
plants growing on the land, can get very dry.

114
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:21,779
It is then easy for a fire to start and to
become very large, very quickly.

115
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:28,760
These fires badly damage people's homes and
other buildings, and many people lose their

116
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,350
lives in the fires.

117
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:40,000
Since the year 2000, parts of the UK have
had floods again and again, and these floods

118
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,559
have caused huge amounts of damage.

119
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:50,089
In 2010, there were extreme floods in Pakistan.

120
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:57,029
These floods had a terrible effect on 20 million
people in the country.

121
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:03,529
Many people lost their lives, and even more
people lost their homes.

122
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:12,730
It takes a huge amount of time and money to
help people after damaging weather like this.

123
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,319
All over the world, we are seeing patterns
of extreme weather.

124
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:24,660
Many places are having their highest-ever
temperatures, and other places are having

125
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,279
more rain than ever before.

126
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:34,890
The effects of this extreme weather are very
dangerous for all the living things in our

127
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,730
world.

128
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:44,369
The number of heatwaves, droughts, floods
and storms we are seeing is increasing in

129
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:47,170
many places.

130
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:53,430
Extreme weather is now becoming normal for
many people.

131
00:13:53,430 --> 00:14:00,480
There has always been extreme weather, but
studies show that climate change has increased

132
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,860
the risk of extreme weather.

133
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:12,360
A warmer world increases the risk of Europe
having a big heatwave, for example.

134
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,119
Studies on the floods in the UK show that
the risk of extremely heavy rain is greater

135
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:25,610
because of climate change, and this has made
the risk of floods in this part of the world

136
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,029
higher.

137
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:36,949
One reason for this is because a warmer atmosphere
can hold more water, so the rain is heavier

138
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:41,790
and the risk of floods is greater.

139
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,889
The effects on people and where they live

140
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:54,290
Climate change can also have an effect on
our food and water, and on our health.

141
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,660
All over the world, we grow food on farms.

142
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:06,620
Much of the food we buy at supermarkets starts
its life in a field or on a farm.

143
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,420
But the food we grow needs the weather to
be just right - not too hot, not too cold,

144
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,930
not too wet and not too dry.

145
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:26,040
Droughts and floods have a very damaging effect
on how much food we can grow.

146
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:33,269
When fields become too wet or too dry, plants
cannot grow.

147
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:40,339
This can increase the price of food, and then
poor people cannot buy it.

148
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,250
These people then have to go hungry.

149
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,100
Some plants may grow better in a different
climate.

150
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,839
But scientists think that the effects of climate
change will make it much harder to grow enough

151
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,019
food for everyone.

152
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:08,980
Climate change may also have an effect on
the amount of water that we have, and many

153
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,769
places may not have the water they need.

154
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:22,029
Across South Asia and China, water for drinking
and farming comes from large rivers.

155
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:29,279
The water in these rivers comes from rain
and snow, and from ice melting high up in

156
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,639
the Himalayan mountains.

157
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,449
Climate change can have an effect on all of
these things.

158
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:45,319
This means lower amounts of water in the rivers
and lower amounts of water for people to drink

159
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,319
and use.

160
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:55,139
Climate change and extreme weather can also
have a damaging effect on our health.

161
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,660
More people could catch some diseases in a
warmer world.

162
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,929
Dirtier air can also damage the health of
all living things.

163
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:13,319
The many effects of climate change can make
people feel worried about their lives and

164
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,589
their families.

165
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:22,169
When people do not have the food and water
they need, it can cause problems between groups

166
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:26,020
of people and communities.

167
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,510
Sometimes people move from their homes to
try to find a better place to live or to find

168
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,360
enough food and water.

169
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,220
The effects on animals

170
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:47,250
Climate change is causing problems for many
of the animals that live on the Earth.

171
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:55,230
Changes in temperature, the seasons (spring,
summer, autumn and winter) and the amount

172
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:03,380
of food and water animals can find all make
life much more difficult for animals in different

173
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,769
parts of the world.

174
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:13,640
When changes to the climate are slow, animals
can find ways to live with the changes.

175
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,019
But when changes to the climate happen very
quickly, it is much more difficult for animals

176
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,700
to do this.

177
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:29,019
The climate change we are seeing right now
is happening very quickly, and it is damaging

178
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:33,169
for many of the living things on Earth.

179
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:40,100
At the same time, animals are losing their
habitats - the places they live.

180
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:47,190
People cut down trees to build towns and cities
and to grow food in fields.

181
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,190
All of these things take habitats away from
animals.

182
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:59,440
Together, climate change and losing habitats
make life very difficult for the animals of

183
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,460
this world.

184
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,980
We may see some animals become extinct in
the future because of climate change.

185
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:16,380
Many animals already have problems, and there
are very low numbers of some animals in today's

186
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,880
world.

187
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:26,840
More climate change may mean that these animals
become extinct, and we never see them again.

188
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,630
Many people already know about the polar bear
and the problems it now has in its habitat,

189
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,740
the Arctic.

190
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,980
The Arctic ice is melting.

191
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,640
This makes catching seals to eat very difficult
for polar bears, because they walk on the

192
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,320
ice to do this.

193
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,460
Polar bears are not the only animals at risk
from the warming of the Earth.

194
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,409
All over the world, there are other animals
that could become extinct because of climate

195
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,549
change.

196
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,400
Many others will find life much more difficult.

197
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,899
Many of Australia's animals have lost their
habitats because of climate change.

198
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:20,510
These animals include the yellow-footed rock
wallaby, the golden-shouldered parrot and

199
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,679
Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo.

200
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,880
Many of our medicines, and all the plants
and animals we use for food, come from the

201
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,200
natural world.

202
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,450
In the future, we may not have the large numbers
of different animals and plants that we see

203
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,039
on Earth today.

204
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:48,780
This will make the world a poorer and sadder
place for the people living on Earth in the

205
00:20:48,780 --> 00:21:01,630
future.

206
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,309
The effects on companies and communities

207
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:12,470
Some companies and communities are already
seeing the bad effects of climate change and

208
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,299
extreme weather.

209
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:21,080
People buy insurance to protect their homes
if something bad happens.

210
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,840
But it is going to become more difficult for
these companies to give insurance against

211
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,679
floods, for example.

212
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,559
When floods happen more often, the cost of
insurance increases.

213
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,720
Insurance companies will find it more and
more difficult to protect these homes because

214
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,880
it costs so much money.

215
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,929
Food and water companies are also seeing the
effects of droughts, floods and other extreme

216
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,380
weather, and these effects are increasing.

217
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:07,960
In 2011, there was an extreme drought in Texas,
in the United States of America.

218
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,490
Many farms could not grow food, or grass for
cows, because there was no rain.

219
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:23,110
The farmers lost billions of dollars because
they had no food to sell.

220
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:29,049
Other companies make electricity using the
water moving in rivers.

221
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,370
But when there are lower amounts of water
in these rivers, they cannot make the electricity

222
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,370
they need.

223
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,399
This has been a big problem for many communities
in Brazil.

224
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:51,730
All of these things can make the price of
insurance, food, water and energy go up.

225
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:59,559
Doing nothing to stop climate change now may
make prices higher for companies and for people

226
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,360
in the future.

227
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:09,600
Many companies are now trying to stop climate
change and the warming of the Earth.

228
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,639
They are trying to find ways that the world
can grow and develop without putting more

229
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,179
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

230
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:26,370
Together, companies are working towards a
future that makes money, but does not damage

231
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,570
the Earth.

232
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:35,160
Finding ways to live in our warmer world and
to stop the temperature increasing could mean

233
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,139
more jobs and a better future for communities.

234
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:46,840
CHAPTER FOUR
Climate change, then and now

235
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,929
Climate change in the past

236
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:57,710
The Earth's climate has always changed, and
this has had a huge effect on life on Earth.

237
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:03,280
Over millions of years, the climate has changed
many times.

238
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,870
It has been very, very cold, with lots of
snow and ice everywhere.

239
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:18,899
It has also been very, very hot, with forests
of trees growing in the Arctic and Antarctica.

240
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:26,269
For the past 2.6 million years, the Earth
has always had some ice in the Arctic and

241
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,159
Antarctica.

242
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,440
But the climate has changed in a pattern - sometimes
warmer and sometimes colder.

243
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,990
This pattern comes from the natural changes
in the way the Earth moves around the Sun.

244
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,820
There have been many "Ice Ages" in the Earth's
past.

245
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:55,470
At these times, there was a large amount of
ice over North America, Europe and Asia.

246
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:03,100
The amount of ice was last at its largest
about 22,000 years ago.

247
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:10,509
At this time, the sea levels across the Earth
were about 130 metres lower than they are

248
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,590
today.

249
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,010
There were fewer people in the world then,
and scientists think that there were only

250
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:23,850
about 130,000 people living in Europe.

251
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:31,210
Between the Ice Ages, the Earth was warmer,
and there was not as much ice.

252
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:37,450
At these times, the sea levels were higher,
and there were different plants and animals

253
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,360
living on the Earth.

254
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,460
At the end of the last Ice Age, there were
fast and extreme changes in the climate that,

255
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:54,610
together with people killing animals to eat,
may be the reason why the woolly mammoth became

256
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:00,490
extinct.

257
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,669
Climate change today

258
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:08,540
Many scientists study the climate and climate
change.

259
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,149
Their studies show that people are the biggest
cause of climate change today.

260
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:22,460
Many of the things that people do increase
the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,

261
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,460
and it is these gases that are making the
temperature of the Earth increase.

262
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:39,059
More greenhouses gases in the atmosphere carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide

263
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:47,370
(N2O) and others - mean more of the energy
we get from the Sun cannot leave the Earth.

264
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,030
This makes the Earth warmer.

265
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,289
Plants and animals take carbon (C) from the
atmosphere.

266
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:02,149
These plants and animals then die, and their
bodies go into the ground.

267
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:08,630
Over millions of years, the bodies of plants
and animals can become fossil fuels.

268
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:15,159
People then burn these fossil fuels in their
homes, in factories, and in cars, buses and

269
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,230
planes.

270
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:24,080
When we burn fossil fuels, the carbon inside
them is put back into the atmosphere as carbon

271
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
dioxide.

272
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,830
People do many other things that put greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere.

273
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:40,700
Cutting down trees in forests (deforestation),
growing food and keeping animals on farms,

274
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,230
and making things in factories all increase
the amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth's

275
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,230
atmosphere.

276
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:57,580
Across the world, levels of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere are over 45 percent higher

277
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,559
than in 1750.

278
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:08,309
In 1750, there were about 280 parts per million.

279
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:15,539
But, in June 2016, even at the Halley Research
Station in Antarctica there were high levels

280
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:22,360
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - over
400 parts per million.

281
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,700
CHAPTER FIVE
The causes of climate change

282
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,299
Carbon sinks and carbon in the atmosphere

283
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,399
On Earth, there is a carbon cycle.

284
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:43,429
Carbon dioxide is a very important gas for
life on Earth.

285
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:45,830
Plants need it to live.

286
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:53,250
They take in carbon dioxide, use the carbon
to grow and then put oxygen back into the

287
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,640
atmosphere.

288
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,059
People and animals then take in this oxygen,
use it to live and put carbon dioxide back

289
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,890
into the atmosphere.

290
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:12,519
When plants and animals die, the carbon in
their bodies can go back into the atmosphere

291
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:19,400
as carbon dioxide, or it can go into the ground
in their bodies.

292
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:26,059
The carbon dioxide on Earth moves between
the land and the atmosphere, and between the

293
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,139
ocean and the atmosphere, too.

294
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:37,460
A carbon sink is something that takes in carbon
and holds it for a long time.

295
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,860
The land and forests on Earth are huge carbon
sinks because they take in a lot of carbon

296
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,040
dioxide.

297
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,450
This is called the land sink.

298
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:59,740
The oceans also take in a lot of carbon dioxide,
so they are huge carbon sinks, too.

299
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,620
This is called the ocean sink.

300
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:11,809
Together, the land sink and ocean sink take
in and hold over half the carbon dioxide that

301
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,200
people put into the atmosphere.

302
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,809
The other half stays in the atmosphere because
there is nowhere for it to go and no way for

303
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:24,539
it to get out.

304
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,620
The carbon sinks on Earth are very important.

305
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,549
They stop the Earth from getting even warmer.

306
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:41,940
Every year, people put about 40 billion tonnes
of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere.

307
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,320
Most of this carbon dioxide comes from burning
fossil fuels and from factories, but some

308
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:57,049
of it comes from deforestation and from changing
the way, we use the land.

309
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:07,450
Over the years since the last Ice Age, the
Earth has become about 4C to 5C warmer.

310
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:14,990
This warming was because of the natural changes
in the way the Earth moves around the Sun.

311
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:21,309
This change in temperature has had a huge
effect on the Earth, its climate, and the

312
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:24,850
plants and animals that live here.

313
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:32,330
If we do not stop putting so much carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere, the Earth's temperature

314
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:41,850
may increase by another 4C to 5C by the end
of the 21st century.

315
00:31:41,850 --> 00:32:08,720
This would cause huge problems for all the
living things on the Earth.

316
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,490
The energy we use now and in the future

317
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:24,799
Across the world, people use twenty times
more energy today than they did in 1850.

318
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,159
In this time, there has also been a change
in the energy we use.

319
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,600
In the past, we burned wood and used energy
from the wind and from the water in rivers.

320
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,200
Today, we burn a lot more fossil fuels than
we did in the past.

321
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,100
As we built more and more factories, we started
to use more and more fossil fuels.

322
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:59,279
We also started to drive cars and travel in
planes, and this burns fossil fuels, too.

323
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:06,249
Today, 80 percent of the energy we use comes
from fossil fuels.

324
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:13,370
Energy from other things, including wood and
water, is just 20 percent of the energy we

325
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,880
use.

326
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:23,340
Right now, energy from the Sun and from the
wind is just 3 percent of the energy we use,

327
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,750
but this is growing quickly.

328
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:33,710
The energy we get from the Sun and wind is
much better for the Earth than fossil fuels

329
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:41,960
because it is clean and does not put any greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere.

330
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,919
Countries need to work hard to increase the
amount of clean energy they use.

331
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,419
For countries around the world, getting clean
energy to people at a low price is one of

332
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:01,080
the biggest problems of the 21st century.

333
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,020
As the number of people in the world grows,
the amount of energy we need also grows, and

334
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,740
this is becoming a bigger and bigger problem
for everyone.

335
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:20,149
Around the world, more than 1 billion people
live without electricity for heat and light

336
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:22,530
in their homes.

337
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,069
Most of these people live in Africa and Asia.

338
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:34,270
Over 3 billion people still use wood in their
homes for cooking, and this can make the air

339
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,119
inside their homes very dirty and dangerous.

340
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,290
It can have a very bad effect on their health,
and millions of people die every year because

341
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,149
of dirty air inside their homes.

342
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:57,349
Outside, fossil fuels also have a bad effect
on people's health.

343
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:03,940
Burning fossil fuels in factories, and in
cars and buses, causes millions of people

344
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,290
to die every year from dirty air.

345
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:15,640
Clean energy from the Sun, wind and water
is the best way to give people the energy

346
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:29,450
they need without having the damaging effects
on people's health and on the Earth's climate.

347
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:34,809
Cutting down forests and damaging soils

348
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:39,250
Forests are one of the biggest carbon sinks
on Earth.

349
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:46,890
Across the world, forests take in carbon dioxide
and hold it in their trees, plants and the

350
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,400
soil under them.

351
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,890
When we cut down trees, most of that carbon
dioxide goes back into the atmosphere.

352
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:04,010
For thousands of years, people have cut down
forests to use the land for farming.

353
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:11,950
This deforestation put a lot of carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere and also caused some animals

354
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,030
to become extinct.

355
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:22,130
Tarpans were wild horses and aurochs were
wild cows, and both of these animals became

356
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:30,670
extinct when people cut down forests in Europe,
Asia and North Africa.

357
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:36,770
In the last century, the deforestation of
rainforests in some parts of the world has

358
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,030
become a big problem.

359
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:46,390
Some of these rainforests are on soils that
hold a huge amount of carbon.

360
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,599
These soils have taken in the carbon slowly
over thousands of years.

361
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:59,720
When people cut down the trees in these rainforests,
they damage the soil under the trees, and

362
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,140
this puts the carbon dioxide back into the
atmosphere.

363
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:15,490
Farming can also damage soils and put even
more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

364
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:26,980
Today, people are still cutting down forests,
often to build huge farms.

365
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:34,320
Over the last 150 years, 25 percent of the
carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere by

366
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,099
people is because of deforestation.

367
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:45,650
Cutting down forests has a bad effect on the
water cycle, too, and this can make droughts

368
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,540
worse in some parts of the world.

369
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:58,740
Deforestation also puts many animals and plants
in danger because it takes away their habitats.

370
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:05,319
It may cause many animals to become extinct
in the future.

371
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:10,490
Past and present changes in carbon dioxide

372
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:16,990
The carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
today are much higher than at any time in

373
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,870
the last 800,000 years.

374
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:29,250
We know this because many scientists work
in Antarctica and study the ice there.

375
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,510
Scientists take ice cores from the Antarctic
ice and use them to find out about the Earth's

376
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,770
climate in the past.

377
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:45,640
These ice cores show that the changes in the
last century are not part of Earth's natural

378
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,630
cycles.

379
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,740
The ice in Antarctica has built up over hundreds
of thousands of years.

380
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,460
Over this time, snow fell and made layers
that built up to make the thick ice that we

381
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,760
see in Antarctica today.

382
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,160
Every time the snow fell, small amounts of
air also got inside the ice and could not

383
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,930
get out.

384
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:23,130
Scientists can take ice cores from more than
3,000 metres down to find air from hundreds

385
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,260
of thousands of years ago.

386
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:33,319
By studying this air, they can find out about
the atmosphere in the past.

387
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:40,200
We can also study the soil at the bottom of
the ocean to find out about the Earth's atmosphere

388
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,400
a very long time ago.

389
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,710
All of these studies show that carbon dioxide
is going into the atmosphere more quickly

390
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:56,170
now than at any time in the past 50 million
years.

391
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:02,740
Today's changes in carbon dioxide levels are
not because of natural causes, but because

392
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,310
of people.

393
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:12,069
Most of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
today will be there for many years.

394
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:16,740
Some will stay in the atmosphere for thousands
of years.

395
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:23,730
This means that we will see the effects of
this carbon dioxide for many years to come.

396
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:29,849
CHAPTER SIX
The risks of climate change

397
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,270
Acidic oceans

398
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:39,460
The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
are having a bad effect on our oceans.

399
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,630
Across the world, oceans are becoming more
acidic.

400
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:52,740
The last time the oceans on Earth were so
acidic was about 250 million years ago.

401
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,850
At this time, a huge number of animals became
extinct.

402
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:07,130
About 30 percent of the carbon dioxide people
put into the atmosphere goes into the oceans.

403
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:13,410
This stops so much carbon dioxide staying
in the atmosphere.

404
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:20,280
Ocean sinks stop the temperature on Earth
from getting even higher, but they also make

405
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,300
the water in the oceans more acidic.

406
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,760
Scientists are starting to understand the
effects that acidic water has on the animals

407
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,760
that live in the ocean.

408
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,549
Many of the very small animals in the ocean,
like corals, are really important for other

409
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:43,970
ocean animals and for people.

410
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:50,940
For example, people eat a lot of fish, and
these fish eat smaller fish and other small

411
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,740
animals in the ocean.

412
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:59,460
If the numbers of these smaller animals get
very low because they are killed by acidic

413
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,240
water, there will be lower numbers of bigger
fish.

414
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,650
This could then cause a problem for all the
animals that live in the ocean, including

415
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,980
those that people eat.

416
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:18,000
So, acidic oceans may cause a big problem
for people, too.

417
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,150
Lower numbers of fish and other sea animals
will make life very difficult for communities

418
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,240
that live near the sea and catch and sell
them as food.

419
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:38,200
It will also make food that comes from the
sea more difficult to buy and more expensive.

420
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,700
Coral reefs are in danger

421
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:48,990
Acidic oceans and warmer seawater are both
very bad for corals, and many corals are dying

422
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,619
in oceans across the world.

423
00:42:51,619 --> 00:43:00,180
Storms, dirty seawater and other ocean animals
also damage coral reefs.

424
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:06,579
People are now very worried about the future
of the oceans' beautiful coral reefs, including

425
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:14,569
Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

426
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:22,540
The risk of large climate changes

427
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:28,310
As the world gets warmer, there is a risk
of large and dangerous changes to the Earth's

428
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,359
climate.

429
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,670
And, once these changes happen, we may never
be able to go back to the climate we have

430
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,630
today.

431
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:44,010
Even small increases in temperature can have
a big effect on the thick ice over Greenland

432
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,109
and West Antarctica.

433
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:54,060
If this ice melts, it will cause sea levels
to increase, maybe by many metres.

434
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,860
This would have a huge effect on the land
next to the sea all around the world.

435
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,450
Studies show that the ice in Greenland is
melting more every summer.

436
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:14,059
There is also information to show that the
thick ice in West Antarctica is melting and

437
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:18,160
that the damage to the ice is very large.

438
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,420
Some scientists think we may never be able
to stop this ice melting.

439
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:31,500
Changes to rain patterns can cause forests
to become very dry, and this can increase

440
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
the risk of fire.

441
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:39,260
Fire and drought can really damage thick forests.

442
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:45,820
Then the forests may become dry land, with
only grass and no trees.

443
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:53,150
This land cannot hold as much carbon, so more
carbon stays in the atmosphere.

444
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,520
This increases temperatures and causes more
changes to rain patterns.

445
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,069
Many people are worried that this cycle may
cause many of the trees in the Amazon rainforest

446
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:07,109
to die.

447
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:14,540
There are many other large changes to the
climate that may happen in the future.

448
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:21,270
These include huge droughts, huge changes
in natural rain patterns and huge changes

449
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,569
in the ocean.

450
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:30,270
The ocean moves warm and cold water around
the Earth, and this has a big effect on the

451
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,230
climate.

452
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:38,430
Changes in how this water moves can cause
huge changes to the climate in different parts

453
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,030
of the world.

454
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:47,500
Scientists are also worried about the increase
in temperature in the Arctic.

455
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:54,440
The Arctic holds a large amount of the greenhouse
gas methane (CH4).

456
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,079
As the temperature increases, this methane
can get into the atmosphere.

457
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,250
This is a huge problem because methane is
a much stronger greenhouse gas than carbon

458
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:14,890
dioxide.

459
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,430
Increasing sea levels

460
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:23,119
Over the last few decades, we have seen the
effects of climate change all over the world

461
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,750
- in all places and all oceans.

462
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:33,560
Climate change has had an effect both on the
natural world (plants and animals) and on

463
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,000
people and communities.

464
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:45,480
Today, the Earth's temperature is about 1C
warmer than it was 150 years ago.

465
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,250
The warmer the world becomes, the worse the
effects are for the natural world and for

466
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:55,559
people, communities and companies.

467
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:02,030
Many people live on small islands around the
world, and these people are very worried about

468
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,290
the effects of climate change.

469
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:11,790
Some islands are only a few metres above sea
level, so floods are a huge problem for them

470
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:18,920
if sea levels increase.

471
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:26,240
Studies show that, 400,000 years ago, the
Earth was warmer, and a large part of Greenland

472
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,369
had no ice over it for a long time.

473
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:37,170
The melting ice caused sea levels to increase,
and they became more than 6 metres higher

474
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,420
than they are today.

475
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,819
Scientists think that the temperature at this
time was only a little warmer than the temperature

476
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:47,549
today.

477
00:47:47,549 --> 00:48:02,770
This shows how important it is to stop the
Earth's temperature increasing any more.

478
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:07,990
What to do about climate change

479
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:14,450
In 2015, the world's countries met in Paris
in France to talk about climate change and

480
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,260
what to do about it.

481
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:25,039
They agreed to take steps to keep the Earth's
warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

482
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:32,369
They agreed to try to keep warming below 1.5
degrees Celsius, but they know that this will

483
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,690
be difficult.

484
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:40,539
To try to do this, they agreed to cut the
amount of greenhouse gases they put into the

485
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:42,260
atmosphere.

486
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,030
This was a very positive step.

487
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:52,789
These plans will help to stop the warming
of the Earth and are good in many other ways.

488
00:48:52,789 --> 00:49:00,590
The plans could help to make the air cleaner,
stop the water in the oceans becoming so acidic,

489
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,150
and help people to live a healthy life.

490
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:14,810
All of these things can have a positive effect
on people's lives.

491
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,950
Cutting carbon

492
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:25,470
In Paris, in 2015, countries agreed to cut
the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse

493
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,780
gases they put into the atmosphere.

494
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:36,080
To stop the Earth's warming going above 1.5
degrees Celsius, people need to stop putting

495
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:42,589
any carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by
the middle of this century.

496
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:48,799
This means that we need to cut the amount
of carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere

497
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,240
right now.

498
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,410
The amount of carbon dioxide we can put into
the atmosphere before there is a large risk

499
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:04,630
of dangerous levels of warming is called a
carbon budget.

500
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:10,830
The more of the carbon budget we use now,
the lower it will be in the future.

501
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:18,039
Together, countries must plan how to use the
carbon budget so that we do not use it all

502
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:19,760
too quickly.

503
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:27,950
For the Earth's warming to stay below 1.5
degrees Celsius, the carbon budget is about

504
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:33,099
2,600 billion tonnes.

505
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:42,119
But scientists think that, since 1870, we
have already put 2,200 billion tonnes of carbon

506
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,560
dioxide into the atmosphere.

507
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:56,049
This means we have already used 2,200 billion
tonnes of the carbon budget, and we only have

508
00:50:56,049 --> 00:51:03,460
about 400 billion tonnes left.

509
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:21,930
400 billion 
tonnes of carbon dioxide sounds like a huge

510
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:29,520
amount, but right now people across the world
put more than 40 billion tonnes of carbon

511
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,150
dioxide into the atmosphere every year.

512
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:41,390
We need to stop burning fossil fuels, cutting
down forests and damaging soils.

513
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:50,570
If we do not, we will use all of the world's
carbon budget to stay below 1.5C in the next

514
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,630
10-15 years.

515
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:01,329
Even if we stop putting any carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere, the temperatures on Earth

516
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:07,420
will stay warm, and this will cause changes
to the climate for hundreds of years in the

517
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,660
future.

518
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:16,280
Because of the greenhouse gases already in
the atmosphere, the oceans will slowly warm,

519
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:23,130
the ice in the Arctic and Antarctica will
melt, and sea levels will increase for many

520
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,220
years to come.

521
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:32,089
CHAPTER SEVEN
Solutions

522
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:34,430
Energy solutions

523
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:40,460
To make a better future for the Earth, people
all over the world need to cut the amount

524
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,630
of greenhouse gases they put into the atmosphere.

525
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:51,970
Today, we burn a huge amount of fossil fuel,
and this is one of the biggest reasons why

526
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:57,579
we put so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

527
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:05,539
We need to stop burning fossil fuels and to
only use clean energy in the future.

528
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:13,280
We can get clean energy from a number of places
the wind, the Sun, plants, the water moving

529
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:22,400
in rivers and the ocean, hot rocks under the
ground, and other new ways of making energy.

530
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:31,559
Nuclear energy also puts very few greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere, but it is expensive.

531
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:37,900
In the future, scientists also need to find
ways of making better batteries so we can

532
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:43,260
keep electricity and it can be used at a later
time.

533
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,750
The batteries we use today do not hold enough
electricity.

534
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:55,250
Better batteries will also help us to move
from cars and buses that burn fossil fuels

535
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,869
to cars and buses that use electricity.

536
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:06,490
There is another step we can take to help
to stop climate change.

537
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:12,470
Scientists need to find ways of taking carbon
dioxide from factories and other places that

538
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:17,090
make it, and keeping it under the ground.

539
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:25,119
Making new carbon sinks can help to cut the
carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere.

540
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,809
We must also try not to use more energy than
we need.

541
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:38,400
We need to find ways of using a smaller amount
of energy in our homes and in factories.

542
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,130
People are now using computers to help to
cut the amount of energy we use, and to put

543
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:50,420
more clean energy into people's homes.

544
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:56,470
Scientists also need to find ways of taking
large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the

545
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:02,260
atmosphere without causing any other problems
for the world.

546
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:09,960
This needs to happen quickly - very quickly
if we want warming to stay below 1.5 degrees

547
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:19,000
Celsius.

548
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,299
Forest solutions

549
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:27,569
The Earth's forests are an important part
of the solution to cutting greenhouse gases

550
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:32,599
in the atmosphere and stopping climate change.

551
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:37,230
Forests are one of the biggest carbon sinks
on the Earth.

552
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:44,890
We need to stop deforestation, protect the
Earth's natural forests, and grow more trees

553
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,970
and forests.

554
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:53,550
This includes growing forests on land that
is not good for farming.

555
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:58,670
Stopping deforestation is a very difficult
thing to do.

556
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:04,780
Around the world, people cut down forests
to use the land for farming.

557
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:10,710
This is an important way for many countries
to make money and for people to make money

558
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:15,359
to buy food and clothes for their families.

559
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:23,170
People need to see how important forests are
because then they will stop cutting them down.

560
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:28,140
This has already happened in many places around
the world.

561
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:36,700
Many countries now understand that their rainforests
help to protect and to develop their communities.

562
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:42,670
These forests have a positive effect on the
amount of rain and clean water communities

563
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:51,220
have for farming and on the rivers that some
companies use to make electricity.

564
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:58,309
Forests also help to protect the land and
soil, and to lower the number of floods communities

565
00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:00,799
have.

566
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:07,150
Forests do a natural job of protecting soils,
and this is important for the food and water

567
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,289
we need and use every day.

568
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:18,589
Protecting forests is a good way to cut the
amount of carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere,

569
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:23,849
and it has a positive effect on many other
things, too.

570
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:30,440
In West Africa, people are helping cocoa farmers
to make more money from the cocoa they grow

571
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,650
without cutting down more trees and forests.

572
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:41,670
This includes growing cocoa plants and trees
together in ways that give farmers more food

573
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,559
from the same land.

574
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,770
Farmers are then making more money for their
families and for their countries, but carbon

575
00:57:50,770 --> 00:58:03,210
stays inside the trees in the rainforests
and does not go into the atmosphere.

576
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,920
Food and farming solutions

577
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,640
Farming can also be part of the solution to
climate change.

578
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:18,020
Farmers can use ways of farming that build
up carbon levels in soils.

579
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,820
Soils are a very important natural carbon
sink.

580
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,460
Some soils are better than others.

581
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:31,980
For example, soils that have very small living
things in them can change dead plants into

582
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,520
food for new plants to grow.

583
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,950
This can help farmers to grow the plants we
eat.

584
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:45,680
These soils are also very good at holding
carbon.

585
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,109
Farmers can help to make these good soils.

586
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:55,020
They can do this by often changing the plants
that they grow on their land and by not always

587
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,760
growing the same plants.

588
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,950
They can also help by sometimes-growing plants
on the land, and sometimes keeping animals

589
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,630
on it.

590
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:10,609
These two steps can help to make soils healthy.

591
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:14,680
These good soils also hold more water.

592
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:20,980
This means that they can protect plants from
drought, and this makes farming easier in

593
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,940
a warmer climate.

594
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:30,380
The amount of carbon dioxide we put into the
atmosphere can also be cut by thinking about

595
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,859
the food we eat.

596
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:38,900
Only growing the food, we need and not throwing
food away will help.

597
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:45,640
Not eating so much meat and other foods that
come from animals will also help to cut the

598
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:51,530
greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere.

599
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,700
Earth's natural cycles

600
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,180
The Earth and its living things run in cycles.

601
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:07,029
The water cycle and the carbon cycle are very
important patterns for life on Earth.

602
01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:11,619
Soils use the good things from dead plants
to grow new plants.

603
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:16,920
In natural cycles, everything is used again.

604
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:23,910
But, in today's world, people often do not
do things in cycles.

605
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:27,270
We make things, and then we use them.

606
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,450
When we finish using things, we throw them
away.

607
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:38,320
When we throw things away, they often go into
the land, the atmosphere or the oceans.

608
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:46,190
We do not use them again, or get back the
energy or things we used to make them.

609
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:50,890
This means that we use a lot of energy and
natural things.

610
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:58,540
But doing things in cycles does not use as
much energy or natural things, and does not

611
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:04,150
put so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

612
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:08,650
Companies need to do things in new and different
ways.

613
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:15,390
They must try to find ways of using everything
again and throwing nothing away - just like

614
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,359
natural cycles.

615
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:25,250
We need to look at the natural cycles on Earth
and try to do things in the same way.

616
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:32,640
Many companies are already using these ideas
to make new things and to help stop climate

617
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,760
change.

618
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:41,260
For example, companies are using natural cycles
to develop new fuels.

619
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,900
CHAPTER EIGHT
The future

620
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,539
Coming together to stop climate change

621
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:55,280
Climate change is a problem for all the people
of the world.

622
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:01,819
One country on its own cannot find the solution
- all the countries of the world need to work

623
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:05,319
together on this problem.

624
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:11,190
Countries also need to work together to develop
in a way that is good for the Earth and does

625
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,269
not damage it.

626
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:21,710
Together, they need to help poor countries
and communities to have a positive future.

627
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:28,809
Many people from across the world have asked
for countries to do more to stop climate change.

628
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:37,250
In 2015, in Paris, countries agreed to cut
the amount of fossil fuels they burn, to protect

629
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:42,299
forests and to increase the health of their
soils.

630
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:46,860
This was a very positive day for climate change.

631
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:53,579
The steps that countries agreed to take in
Paris are still not enough to stop warming

632
01:02:53,579 --> 01:03:10,880
going above 2 degrees Celsius, but the countries
all agreed to do more in the future.

633
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,369
Cutting the amount of greenhouse gases we
put into the atmosphere will help to stop

634
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:20,309
the temperature on Earth increasing more.

635
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:26,450
This is very positive for the future, but
many people around the world will still have

636
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,800
to live with the effects of climate change.

637
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:37,270
So, in Paris, countries also agreed to help
people to find ways to live in our warmer

638
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:45,059
world and to protect them from the effects
of higher temperatures.

639
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:48,869
Making a better life for everyone

640
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:54,510
Trying to find solutions to the problem of
climate change can be a very positive thing

641
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:58,869
for many people and many companies.

642
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:06,240
Across the world, companies can look for new
things to make and new ways of doing things.

643
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:12,640
They can work together with new people and
can make new jobs.

644
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,960
Finding solutions to climate change could
make life better for people in many different

645
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,849
ways.

646
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:28,970
Lots of companies are now developing clean
energies, and this is making many new jobs.

647
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:35,299
Building companies are making new houses that
are comfortable, use very little energy and

648
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:43,349
are cheaper to live in.

649
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:49,670
All the large car companies are now moving
away from fossil fuels and are making cars

650
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:53,130
that use electricity.

651
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:59,809
Companies are also looking at ways of using
new fuels in their cars and aeroplanes, including

652
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:03,109
fuels from plants.

653
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:09,500
This will cut the amount of carbon dioxide
we put into the atmosphere.

654
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:15,619
A lot of companies are now working with the
idea of "zero deforestation" in everything

655
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,690
they do.

656
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:21,230
People cut down trees in forests all over
the world.

657
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:29,460
But, in some forests, people cut down a tree
and then grow a new tree - this is called

658
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:32,970
zero deforestation.

659
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:39,240
Companies across the world are now only using
trees from forests like this.

660
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:46,700
Countries, communities and companies are trying
to build a different future, without people

661
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,099
putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

662
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:57,089
This idea is growing fast and is now making
a lot of money.

663
01:05:57,089 --> 01:06:04,190
Countries can help this change happen faster
- they can make it cheaper to make and use

664
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:10,230
cleaner energy, and more expensive to make
and use fossil fuels.

665
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:16,760
Asking companies to develop clean ways of
doing things can make more jobs, stronger

666
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:23,089
communities and a better climate for everyone.

667
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:25,059
One Earth

668
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:30,920
For hundreds of years, we have used more and
more from the natural world, but there is

669
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,510
still only one Earth.

670
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:40,559
The number of people living on Earth grows
every day, and every day we have a bigger

671
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,990
and bigger effect on the Earth.

672
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:49,690
For the communities of the world to have a
positive future, we must find ways of living

673
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:55,349
on the Earth without damaging it in the way
we do today.

674
01:06:55,349 --> 01:07:01,990
We are already seeing the bad effects of climate
change, but things may be much worse for our

675
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,119
children and our grandchildren.

676
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:12,880
We need to see that the Earth is in danger
and act now to find solutions.

677
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:19,320
Everyone must work towards stopping climate
change - on our own and together.

678
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,549
We can all help.

679
01:07:21,549 --> 01:07:27,410
Every day we can decide to do things that
cut the amount of carbon dioxide we put into

680
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,950
the atmosphere.

681
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:36,020
Every day we can take positive steps to keep
the natural world healthy.

682
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:44,100
We have had a bad effect on the natural world
for too long, and we need to stop now.

683
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:49,029
If we are good to the Earth, only then can
the Earth be good to us.

684
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,460
- THE END -
