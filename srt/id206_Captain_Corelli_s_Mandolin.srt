CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,760
August 1940: The Doctor and his Daughter

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,240
Dr Iannis had enjoyed a satisfactory day in which 
none of his patients had died or got any worse.  

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,200
He had removed a tooth, attended the 
surprisingly easy birth of a lamb,  

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,120
and had performed a successful, 
though minor, operation.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,920
He had been called to the house of old man 
Stamatis, who was suffering from earache.  

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,520
After gazing into the dark, hairy hole of the 
old man's ear, the doctor had cleaned up the  

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,280
inside of the ear using a matchstick, cotton wool 
and alcohol. He was aware that old man Stamatis  

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,200
had been deaf in that ear since childhood, but 
was nevertheless surprised when the tip of the  

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,720
matchstick touched something hard, something 
that had no excuse for its presence there.  

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,680
He took the old man to the window, where the light 
was better, and stared down into the ear again;  

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,520
then with his long matchstick he 
pushed the grey hairs to one side.  

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,240
There was something round inside. He 
scratched its surface and saw a pea.  

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,080
It was undoubtedly a pea; it was light green 
and slightly lined. Dr Iannis considered the  

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,600
problem for some moments, then requested 
a small fishhook and a light hammer.

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,840
The old man and his wife looked at each other 
with the single thought that the doctor must  

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,880
have lost his mind. 'What does this have to do 
with my earache?' asked Stamatis suspiciously.  

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,840
But the hook and hammer were fetched, and the 
doctor carefully placed the straightened hook  

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
into the hairy hole and raised the 
hammer. There was a terrible scream.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,200
'Oh, oh, the fishhook will enter his brain. 
May God protect us!' cried the old wife,  

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
hiding her head in her hands.

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,480
This speech caused the doctor to pause and 
consider the possibility that the hammer  

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,640
might only drive the pea further into the 
ear. 'Change of plan,' he announced, and gave  

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,320
instructions that Stamatis should lie on his side 
till evening with his ear filled with warm water.  

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,840
He returned at six o'clock, hooked the softened 
pea successfully without the aid of a hammer,  

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,720
small or otherwise, and pulled it out. Stamatis 
clapped his hand to his ear and exclaimed,  

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,360
'It's cold in there. My God, it's 
loud. I mean everything is loud!'

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,840
'Your deafness is cured,' announced Dr Iannis. 
'A very satisfactory operation, I think.'  

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
Shortly afterwards he walked home 
with a fat chicken under each arm,  

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
and an ancient pea wrapped up in his handkerchief.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
The doctor was now left with an 
entire evening in which to write his  

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,800
'New History of Cephallonia', a project which he 
had begun at least a dozen times. He seemed unable  

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,360
to achieve objectivity and so had never been 
satisfied with the result. He sat down and wrote:

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,840
'The ancient, half-forgotten island of 
Cephallonia rises from the Ionian Sea,  

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,720
its rocks and red earth heavy with the heat 
of the sun and the weight of memory. In the  

36
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,360
stories of ancient Greece, the island played 
its part and had its gods - among them Poseidon,  

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,760
the god of the Sea and Apollo, the god of the Sun. 
Yes, once this island, with its brilliant light,  

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,960
its transparent waters, was an island 
filled with gods. But today Cephallonia  

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,040
has become a factory that breeds babies for 
export. There are more Cephallonians abroad  

40
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
or at sea than there are at home. There is no 
industry here that keeps families together,  

41
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,600
there is not enough agricultural land, there are 
not enough fish in the ocean. Our men go abroad  

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:17,680
and return here to die. The only good thing about 
it is that only the beautiful women find husbands  

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,840
among the men who are left, and consequently we 
have the most beautiful women in all of Greece...'

44
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,960
The doctor refilled his pipe and read this 
through. He listened to Pelagia moving about  

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,480
in the kitchen, preparing the evening meal. He 
read what he had written about beautiful women  

46
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,480
and remembered his wife, who had died from 
lung disease despite all his efforts and  

47
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,440
who had been as lovely as his daughter was now. 
'This island betrays its own people,' he wrote,  

48
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,480
then seized the sheet of paper and threw 
it forcefully into the corner of the room.  

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,440
This was not good enough. Why could he not 
write like a writer of histories? Why could  

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,560
he not write without passion, without anger 
at the many betrayals and oppressions that the  

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,440
island had suffered in the past? He went outside 
for a breath of fresh air, returning indoors  

52
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,440
just in time to catch Pelagia's little goat eating 
his writings with a look of satisfaction on its  

53
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,000
face. He tore the paper from the animal's mouth, 
chased it outside, then marched into the kitchen.  

54
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,200
'That unpleasant animal of yours has 
eaten everything I've written tonight,'  

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,160
he exclaimed crossly. 'Any more incidents 
like this, and it'll end up on our plates.'

56
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,120
Pelagia looked up at her father and smiled. 
'We'll be eating at about ten o'clock.'

57
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,880
'Did you hear what I said? No more goats inside 
the house.' Pelagia paused in her slicing of a  

58
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,320
tomato, brushed her hair from her face and 
replied, 'You're as fond of him as I am.'

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,400
Dr Iannis turned away, defeated. It was an 
annoying thing when a daughter spoke cheekily  

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,200
to him and reminded him of her mother at the 
same time. He returned to his table, took the  

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,240
title page, 'A New History of Cephallonia', and 
crossed out the first two words, writing instead,  

62
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,280
'A Personal'. Now he could express his opinions 
as freely and unpleasantly as he wished.

63
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,640
When Pelagia heard from a neighbour that a 
strongman was giving a performance in the  

64
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,320
village square, she put away her broom and hurried 
to join the group of curious islanders that had  

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,760
gathered there. Megalo Velisarios, famous all over 
the islands of Ionia as one of the strongest men  

66
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,600
who had ever lived, was jumping up and down in 
time to the clapping of hands. On each of his  

67
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:59,040
outstretched arms sat a full-grown man. One of 
them held on tightly to his body while the other  

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,400
calmly smoked a cigarette. On Vehsarios's head 
sat an anxious little girl of about six years,  

69
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,440
who was making matters more complicated by 
holding her hands firmly across his eyes.

70
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,320
'Lemoni!' he roared. 'Take your hands from my eyes 
and hold on to my hair, or I'll have to stop.'

71
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,960
Lemoni was too frightened to move her hands and 
Megalo Velisarios stopped. With one graceful  

72
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,520
movement he threw both men to their feet, lifted 
Lemoni from his head, threw her high into the air  

73
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,960
and caught her, kissed her dramatically upon the 
tip of her nose and set her down. Raising himself  

74
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,440
to his full height, he cried, 'I will lift 
anything that it takes three men to lift.'

75
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,080
The village priest, Father Arsenios, 
chose just this moment to walk with a  

76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,160
self-important expression across the square 
on his way to the church. He lacked respect,  

77
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,640
not because he was completely round but 
because he was greedy for both money and food  

78
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,840
and was much too interested in women.

79
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,760
'Lift Father Arsenios,' someone called.

80
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,560
'Impossible,' called another.

81
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,680
Father Arsenios quite suddenly found himself 
grasped around his chest and lifted up on to  

82
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,560
the wall. He sat there speechless with surprise, 
his mouth opening and closing like a fish, and a  

83
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,920
guilty silence descended. Pelagia felt her heart 
overflow with pity for the poor man. She stepped  

84
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,520
forward and extended a hand to help him down, 
and the priest walked off without a word. Pelagia  

85
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,120
now spoke sharply to Velisarios. She was only 
seventeen but she was proud and knew her own mind,  

86
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,000
and her position as the doctor's daughter meant 
that even the men were forced to respect her. 'You  

87
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,720
shouldn't have done that, Velisarios,' she said. 
'It was cruel and horrible. You must apologize.'

88
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,400
He looked down at her from his great height. 
This was without doubt a difficult situation.  

89
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
He thought of lifting her above his head.

90
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,800
'We want to see the cannon,' called an old 
lady, and others in the crowd echoed her.

91
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Velisarios was immensely proud of his 
ability to raise the old Turkish cannon,  

92
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,280
which had the date 1739 on it and was 
much too heavy for anyone else to lift.  

93
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,800
He looked down at Pelagia and said, 'I'll 
apologize later, pretty one,' then announced,  

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,480
'Good people of the village, to see the cannon, 
you must bring me your old nails, your broken  

95
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,120
pots, and the stones of the streets. Find me 
these things while I pack the gun with powder.'

96
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,240
People ran off eagerly in all 
directions to seek out these objects,  

97
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,400
and the cannon was soon prepared for the 
great explosion. 'I will fire the gun  

98
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,040
down the road,' said Velisarios when all was 
made ready. 'Everybody out of the way now.'

99
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,040
With a theatrical expression, the enormous man put 
a match to the cannon and lifted it to his waist.  

100
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,880
Silence fell. Breaths were held. There was 
a great roar as the old pots and nails burst  

101
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:43,520
from the gun... and then a long, low cry of pain. 
There was a moment of confusion and hesitation.  

102
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,440
People looked around at each 
other to see who had been hit,  

103
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,880
and Velisarios dropped his cannon and ran 
forward to a young man lying in the dust.

104
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,400
Mandras later thanked Velisarios for firing at him 
as he came round the bend at the entrance to the  

105
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,000
village. But at the time he greatly disliked 
being carried in the arms of the strongman  

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,760
to the doctor's house and he did not enjoy 
having a bent nail removed from his shoulder.  

107
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,240
What he thanked Megalo Velisarios for was that in 
the doctor's house he first set eyes on Pelagia.  

108
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,480
There was a moment when he became aware that he 
was being bandaged, that a young woman's long  

109
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,120
hair was brushing against his face. He opened 
his eyes and found himself gazing into a pair  

110
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,840
of anxious eyes. 'At that moment,' he liked 
to say later, 'I recognized my future wife.'

111
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,600
Dr Iannis put on a fresh shirt in readiness 
for his daily visit to the kapheneion,  

112
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,840
and stepped out into the yard. He was 
entirely unsurprised to see Mandras there,  

113
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,040
talking to Pelagia. The young fisherman's 
face went red when he saw him.  

114
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,080
'Oh, good evening, doctor. I've 
brought you some fish,' he said.

115
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,760
The doctor twisted his mouth and pretended to 
sigh. 'Mandras,' he said, 'you know perfectly  

116
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,880
well that I know perfectly well that you 
have only come here to flirt with Pelagia.'

117
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,240
'Flirt?' repeated the young man, attempting 
to appear both innocent and shocked.

118
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,280
'Yes. Flirt. Yesterday you brought us another 
fish and then flirted with Pelagia for an hour.  

119
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
Well, you'd better get on with it.'

120
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
'Then I have your permission 
to talk to your daughter?'

121
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,560
'Talk, talk, talk,' said Dr Iannis, waving 
his hands, and he set off for the kapheneion.

122
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,640
'Your dad's a funny fellow,' 
Mandras said to Pelagia.

123
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,600
'There's nothing wrong with my father,' she 
exclaimed, 'and anyone who says there is gets  

124
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,360
a broom in the face.' She pushed the broom at him 
and he caught it and twisted it out of her grasp.  

125
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
'Give it back,' she said laughing.

126
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,240
'I'll give it back... in return for a kiss.'

127
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
Pelagia gave the young man a flirtatious smile.

128
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,080
At the kapheneion, the doctor collected his 
tiny cup of coffee and sat next to Kokolios,  

129
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,240
as he always did. The coffee shop was full of 
the usual characters: the Communist Kokolios,  

130
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,400
with his splendid moustache; old man 
Stamatis; Father Arsenios, round and sweating.  

131
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
'What's the news of the war?' Kokolios asked.

132
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
The doctor twisted the ends 
of his moustache and said,  

133
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,720
'Germany is taking everything, the Italians are 
behaving like fools, the French have run away,  

134
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,440
the Americans have been playing ball games, the 
British have been drinking tea, the Russians  

135
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,080
have been sitting on their hands. Thank God we 
are out of it. Why don't we turn on the radio?'

136
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,400
The large British radio in the corner of the 
room was switched on, its whistles reduced to  

137
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,320
a minimum by moving it around. Just then, 
Pelagia appeared at the door, gesturing  

138
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,720
urgently, greatly embarrassed by her presence 
in the men-only kapheneion. The doctor raised  

139
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,240
his eyes to the ceiling, put his pipe in his 
pocket and went to the door. 'What is it, girl?'

140
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,320
'It's Mandras, he's fallen 
out of a tree on to a pot.'

141
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,840
The doctor shook his head in disbelief and 
allowed his daughter to hurry him home.  

142
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,520
There, he made Mandras lie on the kitchen 
table while he removed tiny pieces of the  

143
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,200
broken pot from the young man's muscular 
back. 'You're a fool,' he told his patient.

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
'I know, doctor,' said Mandras, biting 
his lip as another piece came out.

145
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,640
'Stop being so polite. I 
know what you're planning.  

146
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,440
Are you going to ask her to marry you or not?'

147
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,960
'Not yet, doctor. Everyone 
says there's going to be a war,  

148
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,040
and I don't want to leave a widow. 
You know how people treat a widow.'

149
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,280
'Quite right,' said the doctor and wondered,  

150
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,280
as he wiped away a spot of blood, whether his body 
had ever been as beautiful as this young fool's.

151
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,800
It was several hours before he returned to the 
kapheneion. When he entered, he knew immediately  

152
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,080
that something was wrong. Warlike music came 
from the radio and Dr Iannis was astonished to  

153
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,560
see that the faces of several of the men were 
shiny with tears. 'What's going on?' he asked.

154
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,680
'Those Italian pigs have sunk one of our ships 
at Tinos. And they fired on the harbour there.  

155
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
It was full of people. On a holy day too.'

156
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,440
The doctor put his hands to his face and 
felt his own tears fighting to appear.  

157
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,400
He was possessed by a feeling of helpless 
anger. He did not stop to question whether  

158
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,320
war with Italy was inevitable. Although he did 
not believe in God he found himself saying,  

159
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:12,480
'Come on boys, we're all going to the church.' The 
men of the kapheneion rose and followed him.

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,680
CHAPTER TWO

161
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,320
Pelagia and Mandras

162
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,920
Pelagia (resting in the afternoon): Papas says 
that Mandras is going to have tiny pieces of that  

163
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,600
pot in his back for the rest of his life. I like 
his body, what I've seen of it. God forgive me,  

164
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,160
I have such wicked thoughts. Thank God no 
one can read my mind, or I'd be locked up  

165
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,920
and all the old women would throw stones at me. 
I wonder what Mandras is doing. He's so beautiful  

166
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,360
and so tunny too. He made my stomach ache 
with laughing before he fell out of the tree.  

167
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,840
That's when I knew I loved him; it was 
the fear I felt when he fell on the pot.

168
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,280
When will he ask me to marry him? But he's 
not a serious fellow, and it gives me doubts.  

169
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,840
He's so funny, but I can't talk to him about 
anything and you have to be able to discuss  

170
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,560
things with a husband, don't you? I say, 'Is there 
going to be a war?' and he just grins and says,  

171
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,000
'Who cares? Is there going to be a kiss?' 
I don't want there to be a war. Let there  

172
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,480
be Mandras standing in the yard with a fish in his 
hands. Let there be Mandras every day with a fish.

173
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,760
Mandras (leaving the harbour in his boat): It's 
going to be too hot again today, I know it,  

174
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,040
and all the fish will hide in the rocks and 
go to the bottom. Let the clouds hide the sun,  

175
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,200
let me catch some fine fish and I'll take one 
to Pelagia and she'll ask me to eat with them,  

176
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,160
and I can rub her leg with my foot under the 
table while the doctor discusses ancient poetry.  

177
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,240
I know he likes me, but he doesn't think I'm good 
enough for her - he's always calling me a fool.

178
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,840
The trouble is that I can't be myself when I'm 
with her. I mean, I am a serious man. I follow  

179
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,640
politics, I want to improve the world. But 
when I'm with Pelagia it's as if I'm twelve  

180
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,680
again. I want to amuse her and what else am I 
supposed to do? I can't imagine myself saying,  

181
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,840
'Come on, Pelagia, let's talk about politics.' 
Women aren't interested in that sort of thing,  

182
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,280
they want you to entertain them. 
Perhaps she thinks I'm a fool as well.  

183
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,080
I'm not in her class, I know that. The doctor 
taught her Italian and a bit of English,  

184
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,440
and they're not a typical island family. I 
mean, the doctor's sailed all over the world,  

185
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,040
he's even been to America. And 
where have I been? What do I know?  

186
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,680
I love Pelagia, but I know that I will never 
be a man until I've done something important,  

187
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,120
something people can respect me for. I feel so 
useless and insignificant here on the island.

188
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Pelagia (taking roast lamb from the village 
oven): Where is Mandras? He's usually here by now.  

189
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,920
I want him to come, I can hardly breathe, I 
want him so much. My hands are shaking again.

190
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,880
I'd better take this silly smile off 
my face or everyone will think I'm mad.  

191
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,520
Come, Mandras, please come, stay for dinner 
and stroke my ankles with your feet, Mandras.

192
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,560
Mandras (mending his nets): We're going 
to go to war with Italy very soon.  

193
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
I've got a letter saying that I'll be ordered 
to join the army in the next few weeks.  

194
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,560
I know one thing, I'm going to ask 
Pelagia to marry me before I leave.  

195
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,080
With no jokes. I'm going to make her understand 
that in defending Greece I'm defending her  

196
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,560
and every woman like her, and if I die, I'll die 
with the name of Pelagia and the name of Greece  

197
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,040
equally on my lips. And if I live, I'll walk 
with my head held high for the rest of my life,  

198
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:34,320
and everyone will say, 'That's Mandras, who fought 
in the war. We owe everything to people like him.'

199
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,800
The island's saint, St Geronimos, dead for 
five centuries, had lived a genuinely holy  

200
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,920
life and had left his ancient blackened body 
in an island church as evidence of this.  

201
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,160
He was so loved by the islanders that he had two 
feast days, one in August and another in October,  

202
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,440
and on these days he tolerantly looked elsewhere 
as the population of the island became excessively  

203
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,800
drunk. It was eight days before Greece 
and Italy declared war on each other,  

204
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,040
but it might have been any October 
feast day in the last hundred years.  

205
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,000
The cruelty had gone out of the 
sun, and the delightfully warm day  

206
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,600
was made even more pleasant by a light wind from 
the sea that wandered in and out of the trees.  

207
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,120
From all over the island, people made their 
way to the church where the saint's body lay,  

208
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,440
packing the church tightly and 
squeezing together in the yard outside.  

209
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,720
At different points in the crowd, 
Velisarios, Pelagia, Dr Iannis, Kokolios  

210
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,640
and Stamatis all turned their heads sideways 
to hear the distant prayers of the priest.  

211
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:53,520
The sun climbed higher and the people, packed 
together, began to sweat. The heat was just  

212
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,680
becoming unbearable when the service ended, 
the bells rang out and the celebrations began.

213
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,560
A small band began playing while a line of pretty 
girls stepped from side to side at the back,  

214
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,920
and a row of young men danced with 
their heads twisted backwards.  

215
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,120
Those who were drunk began to insult each other, 
and in some places fighting had already begun.  

216
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,440
Pelagia moved nearer the 
church and sat on a bench.  

217
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:29,520
Someone tapped on her shoulder and she looked up 
and saw Mandras. He fell drunkenly to his knees  

218
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,880
and declared dramatically, 'Pelagia, 
will you marry me? Marry me or I die!'

219
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,920
She regarded him silently for a moment, then 
said quietly, 'Of course I'll marry you,'  

220
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,240
When he heard this, Mandras leapt 
joyfully but unsteadily into the air,  

221
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,720
then suddenly became extremely serious and 
said, 'My darling, I love you with all my heart,  

222
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
but we can't get married until 
I get back from the Army.'

223
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,680
'Go and speak to my father,' said Pelagia. Then, 
worried by the strange way in which she did not  

224
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,440
feel as happy as she ought, she made her way back 
to the church in order to be alone with the saint.  

225
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,680
Time passed, and Mandras failed to find 
the doctor before drink overcame him.  

226
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,440
He slept sweetly in a pool of something 
disgusting but unidentifiable, while, nearby,  

227
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,920
Lemoni attempted to set fire to the 
beard of the sleeping Father Arsenios,  

228
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,200
and Kokolios and Stamatis became lost in 
the bushes while searching for their wives.

229
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,320
Pelagia walked back from the feast 
with her father, bursting with a  

230
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,680
painful mixture of anxiety and happiness, 
desperate to mention Mandras's proposal.  

231
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,240
But the doctor was in a much too drunken state 
to be sensitive to his daughter's feelings, and  

232
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,600
when they reached the house, he danced about the 
yard before falling onto his bed fully clothed.

233
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,160
Pelagia went to bed and could not sleep. 'I love 
you, Mandras,' she declared, at the same time  

234
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,800
as doubts rose in her like an invasion of tiny 
devils. How much did she really know Mandras?  

235
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,640
What evidence did she have that he was patient 
and kind? Can you trust someone who replies  

236
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,880
immediately, without thought? She was frightened 
by the suspicion that there was something hard  

237
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,440
about his heart. If it were not love that she 
felt for Mandras, then why this breathlessness,  

238
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,800
this endless desire that made her heart beat 
fast? She imagined that Mandras had died, and  

239
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,400
as the tears came she was shocked to 
discover that she also felt relief.

240
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,240
In the morning she took herself to 
the yard and created tasks that would  

241
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,520
cause her to see him as soon as he 
came around the curve of the road.  

242
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,120
But he did not come, and Pelagia passed 
the day with feelings of impatience  

243
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,640
that soon turned into real concern. That evening, 
when he had still not appeared, her father said,  

244
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,080
quite unexpectedly, 'I expect he hasn't come 
because he's feeling as sick as everyone else.'

245
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,440
Pelagia took his hand and kissed it gratefully.  

246
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,720
'He's asked me to marry him. I told 
him I'd have to ask you,' she said.

247
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
'I don't want to marry Mandras,' said Dr Iannis.  

248
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,240
'It would be a much better idea 
if he married you, I think.'

249
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
'Don't you approve of him, Papakis?'

250
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,000
He turned and looked at her 
gently. 'He's too young. Also,  

251
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,000
I have not done you a favour. You read poetry, 
you speak Italian. He isn't your equal,  

252
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,120
and he would expect to be better than his wife. 
He is a man, after all. I have often thought that  

253
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,960
you would only ever be able to marry happily with 
a foreigner, a dentist from Norway or something.'

254
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,080
Pelagia laughed at the ridiculous 
thought, then closed her eyes.  

255
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,000
The doctor went inside and came out with 
something that he handed very formally to her.  

256
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:18,000
She took it, saw what it was, and dropped 
it into her skirts with a cry of horror.

257
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,680
The doctor remained standing. 'There's going to 
be a war, and terrible things happen in wars,  

258
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,320
especially to women. Use the gun to defend 
yourself. It might happen that your marriage  

259
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,840
will have to wait. We must make sure first that 
Mussolini does not invite himself to the wedding.'  

260
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,520
He turned and went into the house, leaving Pelagia 
to her fears, and after a few minutes she went to  

261
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,840
her room and placed the gun under her pillow, 
imagining once again that Mandras was dead.

262
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,840
It was not until the third day after 
the feast that there was a quiet knock  

263
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,200
at the door. Mandras stood, speaking 
fast, a bucket of fish in his hand.  

264
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,400
'I'm sorry I didn't come sooner, but 
I was ill the day after the feast,  

265
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,160
and yesterday I had to collect my Army papers, 
and I'm leaving for Athens the day after tomorrow,  

266
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,320
and I've spoken to your father, and he's agreed 
to the marriage, and I've brought you some fish.'

267
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,680
Pelagia sat on her bed and went cold inside; 
it was too much happiness, too much pain.  

268
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,560
She was engaged to a man who mixed 
marriage together with fish and war,  

269
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,240
a man who was too beautiful to go away and die in 
the snows of Tsamoria. Suddenly Mandras seemed to  

270
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:48,160
her to be an extraordinarily delicate creature, 
so delicate and beautiful that he was sure to die.  

271
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,680
Her hands began to shake and she 
whispered, 'Don't go, don't go.'
 
 
 

272
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,040
CHAPTER THREE

273
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
The Homosexual

274
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,480
I, Carlo Piero Guercio, write these 
words with the intention that they  

275
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,280
should be found after my death, when 
what is written here will not harm me.

276
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:21,840
I know only silence. I have not told the priest, 
since I know in advance what I will be told;  

277
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:30,160
it is a wicked sin and I must marry and lead the 
life of a normal man. Nor have I told a doctor,  

278
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,560
as I know that I will be informed that I 
am sick and can be cured of my disease.

279
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,480
What could I say to such priests and 
doctors? I would say to the priest that  

280
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,320
God made me like this for a purpose, that 
I had no choice. I would say to the doctor,  

281
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,320
'I have been like this from the start, it is 
nature that has created me.' But they would  

282
00:28:52,320 --> 00:29:00,000
not understand. I am like someone who is the only 
person in the world that knows the truth, but is  

283
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,640
forbidden to speak. And this truth weighs more 
than the universe, this burden cracks my bones.

284
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,160
In my search to understand myself, I have 
read everything, from the most modern to  

285
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,360
the most ancient, and it was in the work 
of the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato,  

286
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,480
that I finally found myself. In his writings, 
he explained that there were three sexes,  

287
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:35,120
the third sex being men who loved men, and 
this idea made sense to me. Plato also wrote  

288
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,480
that if an army was made up of men who loved 
one another, they would be the bravest army  

289
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,840
in the world, because men would become 
heroes, ready to die for their lovers.

290
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,040
I admit that I joined the Army because the men are 
young and beautiful, and because I knew that in  

291
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:00,640
the Army I would find someone I could love though 
never touch. I would not abandon him in battle,  

292
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:09,360
I would win his admiration, I would die for him if 
necessary and in this way give purpose to my life.

293
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:19,200
In the Army I found my family. It was a world 
without women, and for the first time in my life  

294
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,640
I did not have to pretend. I was very fortunate 
at first; our unit was sent to Albania,  

295
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,160
where there was no real fighting, and we did not 
realize that we might be ordered to invade Greece.  

296
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,080
No one outside the Army can understand the joy 
of being a soldier, of being part of a group  

297
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,800
where you are all young and strong and 
quickly learn everything about each other.  

298
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,440
We believed we could not die, we could march 
eighty kilometres a day, singing battle songs.  

299
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,480
We were new and beautiful, we loved 
each other more than brothers.

300
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,280
I fell in love with Francesco, a young married 
soldier from Genoa, who accepted me as his best  

301
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:12,160
friend without ever suspecting my passion 
for him. He was an entirely beautiful boy,  

302
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,440
reminding me of one of those elegant cats that 
give the impression of immense but easy strength.  

303
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,440
I was attracted most of all to his face, 
with its strong, high cheekbones, wide mouth  

304
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,880
and one-sided smile. He was always 
amusing and respected no one,  

305
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,160
constantly entertaining us with his wickedly 
accurate imitations of Mussolini and Hitler.  

306
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,520
Everyone loved him, he never got 
a promotion and he did not care.

307
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:52,240
We soldiers loved the army life but had no love 
of the Fascist leaders of our country, nor did we  

308
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,240
have any idea of why we were in Albania. However, 
looking back, it seems clear that an invasion of  

309
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,360
Greece must have been the final intention; there 
were clues everywhere, if only we had seen them.  

310
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,880
In the first place, there was the fact that all 
the roads that we built (which, we were informed,  

311
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,600
were for the benefit of the Albanians) led 
towards the Greek border. In the second place,  

312
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,600
we heard stories from reliable sources about 
how our frontier posts were attacked a number  

313
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,520
of times by our own people dressed as Greeks, so 
that we could blame the latter for the attacks.  

314
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,080
When some Albanians shot at our soldiers, 
we announced that our attackers were Greeks.  

315
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,960
We also learned that one of our 
leaders arranged to have his own  

316
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,760
offices blown up so that Mussolini could 
finally declare war against the Greeks.

317
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,200
I have related these things as if they were 
amusing, but really they were acts of madness.  

318
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,200
When war against Greece was finally declared, 
we were told that the Greeks would be defeated  

319
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:12,480
within days. We were sent off to die, with no 
transport, no equipment and too few men. At first,  

320
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,960
having no idea of what the future held for us, 
we whistled and sang, and from time to time  

321
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,280
Francesco, marching beside me, looked at me 
and smiled. 'Athens in two weeks,' he said.

322
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,440
Then the weather turned against us and rain 
poured from the skies, turning the ground to mud  

323
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,360
so that we struggled through it, ten thousand 
men whose uniforms were weighted down with water,  

324
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,720
our aeroplanes unable to fly because of the bad 
weather. Our twenty heavy guns sank into the mud,  

325
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,120
and our animals were unable to pull them out. We 
struggled on in these conditions for several days,  

326
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,960
at a height of three hundred metres, 
our legs turned to ice so that we  

327
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,840
could no longer feel our feet. 'Athens in two 
months,' said Francesco with a twisted smile.  

328
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,120
But we saw no sign of the Greeks and believed 
that we were winning without fighting.

329
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,520
On 1 November, a bomb fell among us and there was 
a scream as a poor fellow from Piedmont lost his  

330
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,160
legs, followed by the short, sharp sound of 
gunshot from the trees. We realized that the  

331
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,680
Greeks had cleverly got us into a position where 
we could be surrounded and cut off from all help.  

332
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,560
We were trapped in the valley floor and the 
Greeks, whom we very rarely saw, moved like  

333
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,080
ghosts among the upper slopes, so that we never 
knew when we would be attacked or from where.  

334
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,040
Their bombs seemed at one moment to come from 
behind, at another moment to come from the side or  

335
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,960
from the front. We fired at ghosts and at mountain 
goats. The heroic Greeks seemed to rise out of the  

336
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,000
ground and fall on us as if we had raped their 
mothers. It shocked us. We had no air support.  

337
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,800
'Athens in two years,' said 
Francesco. We were completely alone.

338
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,360
We ate only dry biscuits, but 
when our horses died, we ate them.  

339
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,360
We were ordered to turn back and had to fight 
our way through the soldiers that surrounded us.  

340
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,880
We grew immense beards, we 
were half buried in snowstorms,  

341
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,440
our red, swollen eyes sank deep into our 
heads, our hands were torn as if by cats.  

342
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,840
We became desperately thin, digging for 
food in the frozen ground like pigs.  

343
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,640
It was a hell of machine guns, bombs and ice, 
a hell in which battles were fought without  

344
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,040
rest for eight hours at a time, while on the 
mountains our dead lay in forgotten piles, body  

345
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,920
upon body. We fought on but we lost our hearts 
as a great darkness settled across the land.  

346
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,640
The snow fell endlessly. My boots, 
crawling with insects, fell apart.  

347
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,760
I think it must have been December when we 
understood that we were as broken as our boots.

348
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:26,800
Waking up in the morning, ten degrees below zero. 
The first question: who has frozen to death now?  

349
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,240
Who has slipped from sleep to death? 
These were the days of the white death,  

350
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,840
in which the legs became swollen and turned 
bright purple, deep blue, coal black.  

351
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,760
I was exhausted, shaken by the screams of men in 
unimaginable pain as their legs were cut off by  

352
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,840
our army doctors. I lived in fear of the white 
death and inspected my feet every few hours.  

353
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,720
Francesco was undoubtedly mad. His mouth moved 
continually, his beard became a column of ice,  

354
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,680
his eyes rolled in his head and he did not 
recognize me. We had lost four thousand men.  

355
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,560
There was nothing in our 
lives except the white death,  

356
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,320
the bitter absence of our friends, 
the joylessness of the icy mountains.

357
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,200
One morning Francesco turned to me with a wild 
expression in his eyes, speaking to me for the  

358
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,400
first time in weeks. 'Look,' he said and rolled 
up his trousers, revealing the purple stripes  

359
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,520
on the white flesh. He touched the dead 
flesh with a look of horror in his eyes,  

360
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,560
rolled his trousers back down again and said 
to me, 'It's enough, Carlo. It's too much.'  

361
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:55,920
He began to weep, trembling all over. Then he 
took up his gun and, before I could prevent him,  

362
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:04,400
advanced towards the enemy, stopping to fire 
every five steps. In recognition of his heroism,  

363
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,920
the Greeks did not return his fire, but a bomb 
fell next to him and he disappeared beneath a  

364
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:20,000
shower of mud. There was a long silence. I 
saw something move where Francesco had been.

365
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,600
I put my gun down and ran 
towards the place where he lay.  

366
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,720
The Greeks did not shoot at me and I saw that 
although the side of his head had been blown away,  

367
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,880
he was still alive. I knelt and 
gathered him into my arms, then stood up  

368
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,760
and faced the Greeks, offering myself to 
their guns. There was a silence, and then  

369
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,000
a cheer came from them. I turned and carried 
the bleeding bundle back to our side.

370
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:04,000
Francesco took two hours to die. His blood ran 
down my uniform, his mouth formed silent words,  

371
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:12,000
the light in his eyes faded and he began the 
long, slow journey towards death, suffering  

372
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,880
what must have been indescribable pain. I buried 
him in a deep hole, the home of enormous rats.

373
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,880
We lost the war and were saved only when the 
Germans invaded from Bulgaria, forcing the  

374
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,480
Greeks to fight two different armies at the same 
time. We fought and froze and died for no purpose.  

375
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,960
I took no part in the shameful conquest of 
Greece because the day after I buried Francesco,  

376
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,480
I shot myself in the flesh of my thigh.
 
 
 

377
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,680
CHAPTER FOUR

378
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,360
The Wild Man

379
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,600
On 28 October, Greece and Italy 
formally declared war on each other.  

380
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,920
All the young men of Cephallonia disappeared to 
join the army, and Dr Iannis attempted to join too  

381
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,440
but was turned down when it was discovered that 
he had learned all his medical knowledge on ships  

382
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,160
and had no proper qualifications. Several 
Italian families on the island were attacked  

383
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,520
and their houses were burnt down, and the 
islanders developed a silent, sorrowful  

384
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,920
expression as they learnt to live with the 
thought that their sons and brothers might die.  

385
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,960
As the weeks passed, however, they were comforted 
by the news that their country was winning the war  

386
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,040
and that the Greeks were winning back territory 
that was theirs by right in Albania. The villagers  

387
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,080
went often to church and Father Arsenios surprised 
them by making fine, emotional speeches and by  

388
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,360
not getting drunk. Almost immediately, shortages 
of certain foods and other household essentials  

389
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,240
developed, and beans became the greater 
part of the doctor's and Pelagia's diet.

390
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,160
The war had the effect of increasing the 
importance of Dr Iannis, as the village  

391
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,080
community turned to him for advice and leadership. 
The doctor watched his daughter progress through  

392
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:20,080
a series of emotions, all of which seemed to him 
to be unhealthy and worrying. At first Pelagia had  

393
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:27,600
been in a state of painful anxiety, and then in 
storms of tears. She would sit by the wall outside  

394
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,920
as if she expected her fiance to arrive at 
the bend of the road where he had been shot  

395
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,840
by Velisarios. Later, she developed the habit of 
remaining silently in the room with her father,  

396
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,600
her hands motionless in her lap as tears 
followed each other silently down her cheeks.  

397
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,400
Pelagia calmed her fears by writing letter 
after letter to Mandras, relating island  

398
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,720
news and gossip, telling him about her terrible 
dreams and her fears for him, and begging him to  

399
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,880
write back to her. She began the task of making 
a cover for their marriage bed, but lacked the  

400
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,600
benefit of a mothers instruction in such matters. 
Each time it reached a certain stage, it began to  

401
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,840
look suspiciously like a dead animal, and she 
felt forced to undo her work and begin again.

402
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:24,400
As day followed day it became clear that not only 
had Mandras not written, but that he never would.  

403
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,440
After careful observation of his daughter, her 
father realized that she was becoming bitter  

404
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,680
and increasingly certain that her fiance 
could not love her. When he realized that  

405
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Pelagia was seriously depressed, the doctor 
made her accompany him on his medical visits,  

406
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
sent her to bed early and let 
her sleep in the mornings.  

407
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,440
He made a habit of making her laugh against her 
will, and deliberately made her angry by such  

408
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,680
tricks as moving all the knives from one drawer 
to another. The doctor considered the return of  

409
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,720
her normal cheerful manner to be a sign that 
she had given up her passion for Mandras.  

410
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,680
On the one hand, he was glad of this, since 
he did not truly believe that Mandras would  

411
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,880
make a good husband, but on the other 
hand, Pelagia was already engaged,  

412
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,800
and the breaking of an engagement would cause 
great shame. The awful possibility occurred to him  

413
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,920
that Pelagia might marry a man she no 
longer loved out of a sense of duty.

414
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,280
Pelagia returned from the village with a jar of 
water upon her shoulder, set it down in the yard  

415
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,560
and came through the door, singing. The news had 
been bad for some weeks - not only had Kokolios  

416
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,040
lost two of his sons, but the Germans had attacked 
the Greek army so that the courageous Greek troops  

417
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,160
were at last facing defeat. Strangely, the bad 
news made Pelagia even more appreciative of  

418
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,720
the first signs of spring on the island. She was 
feeling strong and whole and was enjoying having  

419
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,920
the house to herself while her father was away 
visiting a friend on the other side of the island.

420
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,200
Pelagia's singing was brought to a 
sudden stop when she entered the kitchen.  

421
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,320
There was a stranger seated at the kitchen 
table, a most wild and horrible stranger,  

422
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,480
whose hands trembled ceaselessly and whose 
head was utterly hidden beneath a mass of dirt,  

423
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,160
mud and hair. An enormous beard hid the lower 
half of the stranger's face, in which Pelagia  

424
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,800
could see only two tiny bright eyes that would 
not look at her. Rags covered the stranger's  

425
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,840
body and in the place of shoes there were 
bandages, stained with blood both old and new.

426
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,080
Overcome with fear and pity, not 
knowing what to do, Pelagia said,  

427
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,160
'My father's out. He should be back tomorrow.'

428
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:09,680
'You're happy, anyway. Singing,' said the man 
in a cracked voice, and his whole body shook.

429
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
'You can't stay, I'm on my own,' said Pelagia.

430
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,240
'I can't walk,' replied the 
man. 'I walked from Epirus.  

431
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,800
No boots.' Just then, the goat 
wandered through the open kitchen door,  

432
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,560
approached the stranger and made a gentle 
attempt at tasting the stranger's rags. 'Ah,  

433
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,440
at least your goat remembers me,' 
the man whispered, and began to weep.

434
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,200
Pelagia was astonished by these 
words and said, 'Mandras?'

435
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,720
The man turned his face towards her and said,  

436
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,680
'Don't touch me, Pelagia. There are insects 
crawling all over me and I smell terrible.'

437
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,960
Pelagia felt guilt, pity, disgust.  

438
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:12,240
It seemed unimaginable that this pitiful ghost hid 
the mind and body of the man she loved. 'You never  

439
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,240
wrote to me,' she said, making the accusation that 
had destroyed her love for him and left her empty.

440
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,520
Mandras replied, 'I can't write.' 
For a reason she did not understand,  

441
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,080
Pelagia was more disgusted by this confession 
than by Mandras's physical condition. 'Couldn't  

442
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,640
someone else have written for you? I thought you 
were dead. I thought you... couldn't love me.'

443
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:45,680
'How could I let everyone know? How could 
I have my feelings discussed by the boys?'  

444
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,200
He glanced up again so that at last 
she recognized his eyes, and said,  

445
00:46:52,160 --> 00:47:00,160
'Pelagia, I got all your letters. I couldn't read 
them but I got them.' From inside his clothing  

446
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:07,120
he drew out a huge, dirty packet. 'I carried 
you in here,' he said, beating his chest.  

447
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:15,840
'Every day, all the time, I was thinking of you, 
talking to you. I was not a coward because of you,  

448
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,760
I even prayed to you. And when the Germans 
attacked us I got through their lines, and  

449
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,400
all I could think of was that I had to get home 
to you, and now...' His body shook as he wept.  

450
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,720
'Now only the animals know me.'

451
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:40,800
'I'll fetch your mother,' Pelagia whispered and 
ran out of the house, down to the small, fishy  

452
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,720
but extremely clean house by the harbour where 
Kyria Drosoula, Mandras's widowed mother, lived.  

453
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,680
Kyria Drosoula was a woman so large and ugly 
that at their first meeting people wondered  

454
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,040
how she had ever found a husband. 
She was in fact a brave, kind woman,  

455
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,160
and during Mandras's absence she and 
Pelagia had comforted one another.

456
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,880
Now the two women returned, 
breathless, to the doctor's house,  

457
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,880
and found Mandras in exactly the same 
position that Pelagia had left him in.

458
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,840
Drosoula ran into the kitchen with 
a cry of joy and then stepped back  

459
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,200
with an astonished look that in 
other circumstances would have  

460
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,440
been amusing. 'It is him,' said Pelagia. 
'I told you he was in an awful state.'

461
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,960
'My God,' Drosoula exclaimed, then began to 
inspect Mandras as if he were an animal she  

462
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,000
was considering purchasing. 'Go and put a big pot 
to boil,' she said finally, 'because I'm going to  

463
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,840
wash him from head to foot, but first I'm going to 
get rid of this hair, so bring me some scissors.'

464
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,160
Mandras sat motionless as his mother, 
making terrible faces as she did so,  

465
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,520
cut away the ropes and lumps of his hair and 
beard, revealing the horribly infected state of  

466
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:06,800
the skin below and the insects creeping all over 
it. Pelagia felt sickened where she knew that she  

467
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,040
should feel pity, and went indoors to look in her 
father's medicine cupboard. She realized with a  

468
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,560
small shock that she had learned enough from her 
father over the years to become a doctor herself.  

469
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:25,600
Hurrying outside, she told Drosoula which 
treatments to use on Mandras's face and head and  

470
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:31,920
where to use them. After a brief discussion about 
whether it was correct for a woman to see her  

471
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:39,040
fiance with nothing on, the two women decided that 
in these circumstances it was entirely acceptable.

472
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,000
They removed Mandras's rags, and after gazing 
sorrowfully at the parcel of skin and bones  

473
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,240
that sat before them, again under Pelagia's 
expert guidance, Drosoula began washing her son  

474
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,320
and rubbing healing oils and creams on him. 
Pelagia forced herself to remove the bandages from  

475
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,720
Mandras's feet, and despite the fact that at first 
sight they did not look as if they could be saved,  

476
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:11,840
on closer examination she realized that the flesh 
was quite dry. She fetched a bowl of clean water,  

477
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,160
salted it heavily, and as gently as she could, 
she washed and treated the terrible mess.

478
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,200
When Dr Iannis returned the following morning, 
he found not only a half-dead man asleep in his  

479
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,720
daughter's bed, but his daughter and an 
amazingly ugly woman asleep in his own.  

480
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,200
He listened to Pelagia's account of everything 
she had done, then examined the patient carefully,  

481
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,880
paying particular attention to the feet. 
Pelagia nervously waited for his anger.  

482
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,920
'Well done, I have never been so proud,' he 
declared. Drosoula smiled at Pelagia, who was so  

483
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,440
relieved that her hands were shaking, and the two 
women made more plans for Mandras's recovery.
 
 
 

484
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
CHAPTER FIVE

485
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,840
30 April 1941: Invasion

486
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,960
Though he said little, being almost incapable 
of speech due to his physical condition,  

487
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,680
Mandras was fully aware of the change in Pelagia's 
attitude towards him and he hated the way in which  

488
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,600
his mother and fiancee had undressed him, washed 
him and discussed him as if he were not present.  

489
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,360
But the horrors of war and starvation 
had taken away from him the will to live,  

490
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,680
so that he lay for weeks in bed in his mother's 
house, incapable of moving or even speaking,  

491
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,120
constantly revisiting in his mind the 
terrible experiences that had been his.

492
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
The brilliance of his Greek leaders had enabled 
him and many of his companions to survive the  

493
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,040
war against the Italians, but the freezing 
conditions in the mountains and lack of food  

494
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,240
meant that his body aged more in a few months 
than it would normally do in sixty years.  

495
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,320
Then, when the Germans had attacked from 
the south, Mandras's unit had marched back  

496
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,640
down into Greece and had fought bravely but 
uselessly against their enemy, leaving Mandras  

497
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,280
the only survivor in his unit. With a vision of 
a loving, smiling Pelagia constantly before him,  

498
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,960
Mandras had found the strength to struggle 
home, wearing bandages instead of boots,  

499
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,840
through the wild hills, mountains and forests 
that made up the greater part of Greece.

500
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,520
For much of his journey he had met very few people 
and had consequently almost died from starvation.  

501
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,560
If he had been met on his return to 
Cephallonia by the loving Pelagia of  

502
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:52,800
his dreams, Mandras's recovery might have been 
faster. But as week followed week, Pelagia,  

503
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:59,600
though she tried hard to love Mandras, felt only 
coldness towards him, coldness and the growing  

504
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,760
conviction that Mandras was remaining ill in order 
to punish her for her lack of warmth towards him.

505
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,480
'He thinks that nobody wants him,' said Dr Iannis,  

506
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,480
'and he's doing this in order to 
force us to show him that we do.'

507
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,520
'But I don't want him,' thought 
Pelagia, again and again,  

508
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,680
as she sat making the bedcover that had 
never grown beyond the size of a towel.  

509
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,680
But although she spent a lot of time either 
with or thinking about Mandras, there were  

510
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:38,160
other matters that occupied her mind just as much. 
By April 1941, the German army had reached Athens,  

511
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,960
and the royal palace there was occupied not by 
King George of Greece but by German soldiers. On  

512
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,200
the 28th of the month, the Italian army, claiming 
that the Ionian islands belonged to them by right,  

513
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,880
invaded the island of Corfu, making it inevitable 
that Cephallonia would be next on the list.

514
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:05,040
For the islanders, the waiting was painful. Every 
last moment of freedom and security was rolled  

515
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,600
about on the tongue, tasted and remembered. 
Fathers who expected to be beaten to death  

516
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,960
stroked the hair of pretty 
daughters who expected to be raped.  

517
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Sons sat with their mothers on doorsteps 
and talked gently of their memories.  

518
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,680
Father Arsenios knelt in his church, 
attempting to find words to a prayer,  

519
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,440
puzzled by an odd sensation of having been 
abandoned by God instead of the other way round.

520
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,520
In these last weeks before the invasion,  

521
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,240
Dr Iannis wrote what he believed to be the 
final part of his 'History of Cephallonia':

522
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,880
'Among those who invaded and occupied our island 
- the Romans, the Turks, the Russians, the French,  

523
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,440
the British' - he began, 'the Italians made the 
greatest impression upon us, because we spent the  

524
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:04,320
period from 1194 to 1797 under Italian rule. This 
explains a great many things that may puzzle the  

525
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:11,040
foreigner, for example, the numerous Italian words 
that exist in our vocabulary, and the architecture  

526
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:17,040
of the island, which is almost entirely 
Italian.' He continued on this subject for  

527
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,800
a number of pages, then, when it seemed that the 
Italian invasion was due at any moment, he wrote:

528
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,800
'I wait in the knowledge that this 
may be the last thing I ever write.  

529
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,640
I beg that whoever finds these papers 
should preserve and not destroy them.'

530
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,080
Placing the papers in a black tin box, the doctor 
lifted the old carpet beneath the table and opened  

531
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:49,040
a trapdoor, revealing the large hole that had been 
made in 1849 in order to hide island rebels sought  

532
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,720
by the British, who then governed the island. 
He placed his work safely inside the hole,  

533
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,960
then went outside to listen for the 
sound of approaching aeroplanes.

534
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,280
On 30 April foreign aircraft and ships 
were seen approaching from the horizon.  

535
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,520
Drosoula ran inside to Pelagia shouting, 
'Italians, Italians. It's the invasion,'

536
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,600
Pelagia's immediate reaction was to run up 
the hill to be with her father, whom she found  

537
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:23,120
standing in his doorway, as everyone else stood 
in theirs, protecting his eyes against the sun  

538
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:29,200
as he watched the planes. Out of breath, 
she flew into his arms and felt him tremble,  

539
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:36,400
then realized with a small shock that he 
shook, not from fear, but from excitement.

540
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,760
'History,' he cried, 'all this time 
I have been writing history, and now  

541
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,720
history is happening before my eyes.'

542
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,560
The Italian soldiers stepped apologetically 
out of their aircraft and ships  

543
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:00,480
and waved cheerfully but hesitantly to the people 
in their doorways. In the village, Pelagia and her  

544
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,920
father watched the Italian units go by, their 
leaders consulting maps with puzzled faces.  

545
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,640
A line of men marched by, led by Captain 
Antonio Corelli, with the mandolin that he had  

546
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:20,720
named Antonia hanging on his back. When he saw 
Pelagia he shouted, 'Bella bambina eyes left!'

547
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,040
The heads of the soldiers turned in her direction,  

548
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:31,920
and for one unbelievable minute Pelagia was forced 
to watch the most ridiculous behaviour. There was  

549
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,160
a soldier who crossed his eyes and folded down 
his lower lip, another who pushed his lips out  

550
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:46,080
and blew her a kiss, another who pretended at 
each step to stumble over his own feet. Pelagia  

551
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,680
put her hand to her mouth. 'Don't laugh,' 
ordered the doctor. 'It's our duty to hate them.'

552
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,520
All over Cephallonia the islanders painted rude 
remarks about the invaders in huge letters on all  

553
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:07,200
available walls. The men related Italian jokes. 
What is the shortest book in the world? The  

554
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:16,000
Italian Book of War Heroes. Why do Italians wear 
moustaches? To be reminded of their mothers. A  

555
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,160
decision was made that the local population should 
provide Italian officers with accommodation.  

556
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,840
So one day the doctor came home and found a 
round Italian officer standing in the kitchen.

557
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,480
'Buon giorno,' said the officer.

558
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,560
'Buon giorno,' the doctor replied. 'Perhaps 
you could tell me why you are here.'

559
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,840
'Ah,' said the man uncomfortably,  

560
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:46,000
'I am sorry to say, you are going to have 
to provide accommodation for an officer.'

561
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,720
'Impossible,' said the doctor angrily. 
Then an interesting thought occurred to him  

562
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,560
and he asked, 'Do you have a supply of medicines?'

563
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,360
'Naturally,' replied the officer.  

564
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,680
The two men exchanged glances, understanding 
perfectly what the other was thinking.

565
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,520
'There are many things I need,' said the doctor.

566
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,960
'And I need accommodation. So?'

567
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,160
'So it's a deal,' said the doctor.

568
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,640
'A deal,' repeated the 
officer. 'Anything you want,  

569
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,480
send me a message through Captain 
Corelli. You will find him charming.'

570
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,120
In the early evening Captain Corelli 
arrived, driven by another soldier,  

571
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:38,560
Carlo Piero Guercio. The captain looked around, 
appreciating the signs of a quiet domestic life.  

572
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:45,120
There was a goat tied to a tree, and a 
young woman with dark eyes at a table,  

573
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:51,440
with a scarf tied round her head and a large 
cooking knife in her hand. The captain fell to  

574
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,760
his knees before her and exclaimed dramatically, 
'Please don't kill me, I am innocent.'

575
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,120
Pelagia smiled, against her will, and glanced 
at Carlo, amazed to see that he was as big as  

576
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:13,440
Velisarios. The captain leapt up. 'I am Captain 
Antonio Corelli and this...' he took Carlo by  

577
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,640
the arm, '... is one of our heroes. He 
rescued a fallen friend under fire.'

578
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,880
'It's nothing,' said Carlo with a shy smile, and 
Pelagia knew immediately that, despite his size,  

579
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:34,480
he was a soft and saddened man. 'This...' Corelli 
continued, tapping a case in his hand, '... is  

580
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:41,760
Antonia. By what name do men know you, may I 
ask?' Pelagia looked at Corelli properly for  

581
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,360
the first time and realized that this was the 
same officer who had commanded his men to march  

582
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:55,600
past at 'eyes left'. At the same moment Corelli 
recognized her. 'Ah,' he exclaimed and smacked  

583
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:02,000
himself on the wrist, then fell to his knees once 
more and said softly, 'Forgive me, I have sinned.'

584
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,040
Dr Iannis came out, saw the 
captain on his knees and said,  

585
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,200
'Captain Corelli? I want a word with you. Now.'

586
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,840
Surprised by the authority in the older man's 
voice, Corelli stood up and held out his hand,  

587
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,800
but the doctor did not put out his own, instead 
saying sharply, 'I want an explanation please.  

588
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,640
Why has the teaching of Greek 
history been forbidden in schools?  

589
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,840
And why is everyone being 
forced to learn Italian?'

590
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,080
The captain felt himself wanting 
to run away like a little boy.  

591
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,760
'I am not responsible for it,' he said.

592
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,840
The doctor frowned fiercely and 
shook his finger at the captain.  

593
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,520
'There would be no wars, captain, if 
men like you took more responsibility.'

594
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,760
'I must protest,' the captain replied weakly.

595
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:01,760
'Fool,' said the doctor forcefully and returned 
inside, very satisfied with himself. Pelagia could  

596
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:08,480
not help feeling sorry for the captain. 'Your 
father is...' he said, and the words failed him.

597
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,040
'Yes, he is,' confirmed Pelagia.

598
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,560
'Where shall I sleep?' asked 
Corelli, eager to change the subject.

599
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,920
'You will have my bed,' said Pelagia.

600
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:25,280
Under normal circumstances Antonio 
Corelli would have asked brightly,  

601
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,400
'Are we going to share it then? How kind,' but 
now, after the doctor's words, he received this  

602
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,640
information with horror. 'Impossible,' he 
said. 'Tonight I shall sleep in the yard  

603
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,440
and tomorrow I shall request 
alternative accommodation.'

604
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,160
Pelagia was shocked by the feelings 
of anxiety that rose in her.  

605
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,080
Could there be something inside her 
that wanted this foreigner, this  

606
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,160
invader, to stay? She went inside and told 
her father about the captain's decision.  

607
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,840
'He can't go,' he said. 'How am I supposed 
to be nasty to him if he isn't here?  

608
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:08,800
And anyway, he seems like a pleasant boy.' He took 
his daughter's arm and went back out with her.  

609
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,160
'Young man,' he said to the captain, 'you 
are staying here whether you like it or not.  

610
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,480
It is quite possible that we 
will be sent someone even worse.'

611
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,200
'Yes,' said the captain, 
overcome with embarrassment.

612
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:31,600
'Kyria Pelagia will bring water, some coffee and 
food. You will find we look after our guests,  

613
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,640
even those who do not deserve it. Your 
vast friend is welcome to join us.'

614
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,840
The captain went to call Carlo to the meal in a 
state of miserable obedience and utter defeat.

615
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,200
When the captain woke after his first night in 
the doctor's house, he went into the kitchen,  

616
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:58,480
saw Pelagia fast asleep and did not know what 
to do. He looked down upon her and realized  

617
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:04,640
he wanted to crawl in beside her - nothing 
could have seemed more natural - but instead  

618
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,280
he returned to his room and took his 
mandolin, Antonia, out of its case.  

619
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,560
After practising for five minutes or so, he 
began playing a very fast, complicated piece,  

620
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:23,440
forgetful of the sleeping girl next door, so that 
Pelagia woke to indescribably beautiful music  

621
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,040
coming from somewhere in the house. She lay 
listening, then went to dress in her father's  

622
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,320
room, and Corelli, realizing that she had 
risen at last, came out into the kitchen.

623
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,920
'That was lovely,' commented Pelagia.

624
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,240
He looked unhappy. 'I'm sorry, I woke you up.'

625
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,960
'That's very beautiful,' she said, 
gesturing towards the instrument.  

626
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,280
'Why do you play the mandolin?'

627
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:55,760
'Why does one do anything? My uncle gave me 
Antonia and I discovered I could be a good  

628
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:01,840
musician. When the war's over, I'm going to become 
a professional concert player and composer.'

629
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,400
'You're going to be rich and famous, 
then,' Pelagia said jokingly.  

630
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,400
'Why don't you play me something?'

631
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,760
The captain picked up the mandolin, and a stream 
of notes poured from it that made Pelagia's mouth  

632
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:22,880
fall open. She had never before heard such 
complex, lovely music. She realized for the  

633
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,720
first time that music was not just a sweet 
sound, but was, to those who understood it,  

634
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,600
an emotional and intellectual journey, 
a journey that she wanted to share.  

635
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,960
She leaned forward and put her hands 
together as if she were at prayer.

636
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,440
'There you are,' said the 
captain when he had finished.

637
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:51,040
In her excitement at the music, she wanted to 
dance and spin round, but she only said, 'I  

638
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:57,280
just don't understand why an artist like you would 
descend to being a soldier. It's a waste of time.'

639
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:04,320
'Of course it's a waste of time.' He rose and 
glanced at his watch. 'Carlo should have been  

640
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:10,720
here by now. I'll have to go and find him.' He 
looked at her with one eyebrow raised and said,  

641
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:17,840
'By the way, Signorina, I couldn't help noticing 
that you have a gun in the pocket of your skirt.'

642
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,760
Pelagia began to tremble 
but the captain continued,  

643
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,080
'I understand why you might want to have 
it, and in fact I haven't seen it at all,  

644
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,920
but you must realize what would happen 
if someone else saw it. Be more careful.'

645
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,360
She looked up at him, appealing 
with her eyes, and he smiled,  

646
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,840
tapped the side of his nose and was gone.

647
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,320
Carlo had not arrived with the 
car to pick up Captain Corelli,  

648
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,200
because it had broken down some 
kilometres from the village.  

649
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:58,240
After kicking the car a number of times, Carlo had 
set off on foot towards the village. Velisarios  

650
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,360
passed him and the two men looked at one 
another with something like recognition,  

651
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:09,520
because both men had become accustomed to the sad 
suspicion that they were unique in a peculiar way.  

652
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,400
They were both amazed at the other's size and 
for a moment forgot that they were enemies.  

653
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:22,880
'Hey!' said Velisarios, raising his hands 
in a gesture of pleasure. Carlo offered  

654
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:29,360
him one of his disgusting cigarettes, Velisarios 
accepted, and they made sour faces to each other  

655
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,880
as they smoked. They then went their separate 
ways, more content than before they had met.

656
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,840
As Carlo walked up the hill towards the house, 
his mind turned towards Captain Corelli.  

657
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,800
For the first time since the death of 
Francesco in the mountains of Albania,  

658
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:52,320
the soldier was experiencing a kind of 
happiness; in the captain he had once  

659
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:59,200
again found a man whom he could love and serve. 
In his eyes, Corelli was endlessly optimistic,  

660
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:05,840
a clear fountain, a kind of saint who remained a 
man of honour because he knew no other way to be.  

661
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,920
Carlo knew that some people thought that 
Corelli was a little mad, but for him, the  

662
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,440
captain was a man who loved life so much that he 
did not care what kind of an impression he made.

663
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,520
One of the pleasures of Carlo's life, at 
that time, was an opera group called La  

664
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,240
Scala that the captain had organized from 
among those of his men who could sing.  

665
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,160
Carlo, who had a fine singing voice, had been 
invited to join when the captain had heard  

666
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:40,240
him singing as he polished his boots. There was 
another more unusual member of the opera group,  

667
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:46,160
a young German soldier called Gunter Weber, 
part of a troop of three thousand German  

668
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,240
soldiers who had accompanied the Italian 
army on their invasion of the island.  

669
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,520
Although relations between the Germans and 
Italians appeared friendly, the Germans thought  

670
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:01,680
of the Italians as inferior, and the Italians were 
puzzled by German discipline and lack of humour.

671
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,680
But Captain Corelli had made 
friends with Gunter Weber,  

672
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:11,360
a boy who spoke some Italian and whom the captain 
liked because his face was open and friendly,  

673
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:16,000
and because when he got drunk he 
laughed and lost his German seriousness.  

674
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,640
Weber became a member of the opera club despite 
the fact that he could not sing a note. Neither  

675
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:28,720
Corelli nor Carlo knew that one day the German 
would betray his friends with a storm of bullets  

676
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,840
that would open red and bleeding wounds in the 
bodies of the companions he had grown to love.

01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,960
CHAPTER SIX

678
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,280
The Freedom Fighter

679
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:48,960
After Captain Corelli had left, Pelagia did 
some household tasks, then went outside to  

680
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,640
brush her goat, thinking about the captain 
as she did so. Mandras caught her dreaming.

681
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,880
He had climbed out of bed, cursing and completely 
cured, on the day of the invasion, as if the  

682
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,160
arrival of the Italians was something so important 
that illness was a luxury to be left behind.  

683
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,280
He had gone down to the sea and 
swum as if he had never been away,  

684
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:18,880
and had returned with a smile on his face 
and a fish for Pelagia. But Pelagia only felt  

685
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,040
guilty now, whenever she saw 
him, and deeply uncomfortable.

686
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,720
She jumped when he tapped her on the shoulder 
and despite her effort to force a bright smile,  

687
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,280
he did not fail to see the look of alarm in her 
eyes. He ignored it but would remember it later.  

688
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,480
'I'm going to join the freedom fighters,' 
he said. 'I'm leaving tomorrow.'

689
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:48,480
'Oh,' said Pelagia. There was a long silence, 
then she said, 'I won't be able to write.'

690
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:49,920
'I know.'

691
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,680
Pelagia shook her head slowly and 
sighed. 'Promise me one thing.  

692
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,160
Whenever you are planning to do something 
terrible, think of me and don't do it.'

693
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,440
'I'm a Greek,' he said gently. 'Not a Fascist. 
And I will think of you every minute.'

694
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,720
She heard the sincerity in his voice 
and felt herself wanting to cry.  

695
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,080
They embraced, like brother and sister, 
not people who were engaged to be married.  

696
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,240
'God go with you,' said Pelagia, 
and he smiled sadly. 'And with you.'

697
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,920
'I shall always remember 
you swinging in the tree.'

698
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,280
They laughed, then he looked at 
her lovingly for one last moment,  

699
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:41,840
took a few steps, paused, turned and 
said softly, 'I shall always love you.'

700
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,640
***

701
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,960
Mandras joined a group of three men in the 
hills of the Peloponnisos in southern Greece.  

702
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,960
They had neither plan nor purpose. All they 
knew was that they were driven by something  

703
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,080
from the depths of the soul, something that 
commanded them to rid their land of strangers  

704
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,800
or die in the attempt. They set fire to lorries, 
and one of their number stabbed an enemy soldier  

705
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,960
and afterwards sat shaking with fear and disgust 
while the others comforted and praised him.  

706
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,560
They lived on the edge of a forest in a cave, 
living off supplies brought by the priest  

707
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,520
of a neighbouring village. There were several 
other groups of freedom fighters in the area,  

708
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,560
the most organized being 
a Communist group known as  

709
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,160
ELAS (although it did not declare itself as 
communist, preferring to disguise the fact).

710
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,400
Mandras joined ELAS at first because 
he had no choice. He and his companions  

711
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,120
were lying in a small leafy 
shelter that they had built,  

712
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,440
when they were suddenly surrounded 
by ten men with thick beards,  

713
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:52,560
pointing guns at them. Their leader, who wore 
a dirty red cap, said, 'Come out,' and the men  

714
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,320
slowly stood up and came out, fearing for their 
lives, their hands upon the backs of their heads.

715
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,160
'Who are you with?' demanded the man with the cap.

716
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,840
'With no one,' replied Mandras, confused.

717
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,000
'The deal is that either 
you go back to your villages  

718
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,920
and leave us your weapons,' said the leader 
commandingly, 'or you fight us and we kill you,  

719
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,520
or you join us under my command. This is my 
territory and no one else's. Which is it?'

720
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,080
'We came to fight,' explained 
Mandras. 'Who are you?'

721
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:34,560
'I am Hector, not my real name, and we are the 
local branch of ELAS.' Hector's men grinned in  

722
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,120
a very friendly fashion, and Mandras looked 
from one of his companions to the others.  

723
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:48,000
'We stay?' he asked, and they nodded. They had 
been too long in the hills to give up the fight  

724
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,680
and it was good to have found a leader 
who might know what ought to be done.

725
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,960
'Good,' said Hector. 'Come with us, 
and let's see what you are made of.'

726
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:04,080
He led Mandras and his companions three kilometres 
to a tiny house guarded by one of Hector's men.  

727
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:10,880
'Bring him out,' Hector said, and the man kicked 
and pushed a thin old man out into the sunlight,  

728
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,240
where he stood trembling and blinking. Hector 
handed Mandras a length of knotted rope  

729
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,760
and, pointing to the old man, said, 'Beat him.'

730
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,040
Mandras stared at Hector in disbelief  

731
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,480
and the latter stared fiercely back at him. 
'If you want to be with us, you've got to  

732
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,240
learn to teach these people a lesson. This 
man has been found guilty. Now beat him.'

733
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,800
Mandras struck the man once with the 
rope, lightly, because of the man's age,  

734
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,840
and Hector impatiently exclaimed, 
'Harder, harder. What are you? A woman?'  

735
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,280
Mandras struck the old man once more, a 
little harder. 'Again,' commanded Hector.

736
01:14:54,240 --> 01:15:01,600
It was easier each time he hit him. In fact 
it became a pleasure. It was as if all the  

737
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:08,000
anger from the earliest years of his childhood 
rose in him and was given expression. The old  

738
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:15,520
man threw himself to the ground, screaming, and 
Mandras suddenly knew he could be a god. Hector  

739
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:21,200
stepped forward, took the rope from his hand, 
and placed a gun in his grasp. 'Now kill him.'

740
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:29,760
Mandras knelt down and placed the gun against 
the old man's head, but he could not do it. He  

741
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,960
closed his eyes tight and told himself that 
he had to be a man in front of other men.  

742
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,280
Anyway, he was only doing what Hector had 
ordered him to do. The man was going to  

743
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:47,360
die anyway. Mandras tightened the muscles 
of his face and shot the man in the head.

744
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,960
Afterwards he looked not at the 
bloody mess of bone and brain,  

745
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,760
but in disbelief at the smoking gun. Hector 
patted Mandras on the back and said, 'Well done'.  

746
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,800
Mandras tried to struggle to 
his feet but could not do so,  

747
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,280
and Hector helped him up. 'Revolutionary 
justice,' he said. 'Historical necessity.'

748
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,840
As they left the village, Mandras found 
that he could not look anyone in the face  

749
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,040
and he stared down into the dirt. 
'What did he do?' he asked finally.

750
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,960
'He was a dirty old thief. He took a bottle of 
whisky from supplies that were meant for us.  

751
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,080
You have to be tough with these people 
or they start doing what they like.  

752
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,320
They're full of the wrong ideas and it's 
just something we have to get out of them.'

753
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,320
***

754
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:46,000
During his time with Hector, Mandras learnt a 
great many things. Hector taught Mandras to read  

755
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,480
and write, and taught him all about Communism. 
Mandras learnt that he was not a fisherman  

756
01:16:52,480 --> 01:17:00,000
but a worker, and that he was as good as Dr Iannis 
and deserved the same pay. He learnt to take food  

757
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,400
and animals from hungry villagers without payment, 
since ELAS was working so hard on behalf of the  

758
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:13,120
Greek people. When villagers attempted to resist 
them, then Hector and his men punished them,  

759
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:20,080
not just by shooting them but by tearing out 
eyes and cutting mouths so that people died  

760
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:27,440
smiling. Hector explained to Mandras that the 
villagers were Fascists and loyal to the king,  

761
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,640
and that a good lesson would 
help them to change their ways.

762
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:39,360
Mandras also learnt to rape women and to enjoy 
their screams, since it was all in a good cause.  

763
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,920
A new and better Greece would be built, and you 
did what you liked with the inferior bricks that  

764
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,440
were going to be thrown away anyway. It was 
like making an omelette and throwing away  

765
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:57,840
the eggshells, said Hector, and Mandras 
drank in every word his leader said.
 
 
 

766
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,480
CHAPTER SEVEN

767
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,560
A Problem with Eyes

768
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:10,080
Pelagia treated the captain as badly 
as she could. If she served him food,  

769
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,920
she would deliberately spill it as she put it 
down, and eventually she noticed that he had  

770
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,800
acquired the habit of not pulling in his chair 
until she had already put the food on the table.  

771
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,640
His failure to protest at her treatment 
of him and his constant politeness  

772
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:33,200
made her even more annoyed. Her anger was so 
deep and so bitter that she needed to shout at  

773
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:39,360
him or even strike him in order to release 
it. After two months of sleepless nights,  

774
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:45,040
months during which she had done her best to 
annoy him, the captain remained calm and friendly.

775
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:53,440
One day he left his gun on the table. After 
some thought, Pelagia decided to put the gun  

776
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,840
in a bowl of water for a few minutes in 
the hope that this would do some damage.  

777
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,760
The captain came in and caught her just as 
she was lifting the gun out of the water.  

778
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:09,440
She heard a voice behind her and, in 
her fear, dropped it back in the bowl.

779
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,840
'Oh God,' she exclaimed, 'you frightened me!'

780
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:21,360
The captain looked down at the gun, raised his 
eyebrows and said coolly, 'I see you're trying  

781
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:28,240
to make trouble for me.' This was not what she 
had expected, but nevertheless her heart beat  

782
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:36,560
faster with fear and anxiety. 'I was washing it,' 
she said weakly at last. 'It was terribly oily.'

783
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,600
'How charming to know so little 
about guns,' said the captain.  

784
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,160
Pelagia went red, strangely 
angered by his suggestion,  

785
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:51,520
which she knew he did not mean, that she was 
a sweet and silly girl who did stupid things.

786
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,480
'You are not a good liar,' the captain added.

787
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,680
'What do you expect?' she demanded, 
immediately wondering what she had meant.

788
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:07,600
The captain seemed to know, however. 
'It must be very difficult for you all  

789
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,720
to have to put up with us.' He removed 
the gun from the bowl, sighed and said,  

790
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,840
'I suppose you have done me a 
favour. It does need cleaning.'

791
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,440
'Aren't you angry, then? Why aren't you angry?'

792
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:28,000
'What's anger got to do with music? Do you really 
believe I've got nothing important to think about?  

793
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,040
Let's just think about important 
things and leave one another in peace.  

794
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,120
I'll leave you alone and you can leave me alone.'

795
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:45,760
This idea struck Pelagia as new and unacceptable. 
She did not want to leave him alone, she wanted  

796
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:52,320
to shout at him and hit him. Suddenly overcome 
with emotion, she struck him with all her force,  

797
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,320
right across the left cheek. 
He tried to step back in time,  

798
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,880
but was too late. He steadied himself and touched 
a hand to his face, as if comforting himself,  

799
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:11,760
then held out the gun. 'Put it back in the water,' 
he said, 'I might find it less painful.' This  

800
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,920
remark made Pelagia even angrier. She rushed 
out into the yard and kicked an iron pot,  

801
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:24,480
injuring her toe, then threw the pot over the 
wall. The captain, watching her from the window,  

802
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:32,800
shook his head in amazement. These Greek girls, 
such passion and fire, he thought admiringly, and  

803
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:40,240
then wondered why no one had ever written an opera 
set in modern Greece. A tune entered his mind and  

804
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:45,680
he began to sing it softly to himself, thinking 
that perhaps he would call it 'Pelagia's March'.

805
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:54,240
As the months went by, Pelagia noticed that she 
was losing her anger, and this puzzled and upset  

806
01:21:54,240 --> 01:22:00,480
her. The fact was that the captain had become 
as much a part of the house as the goat or her  

807
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,840
own father, and she was quite used to seeing 
him playing with little Lemoni in the yard,  

808
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:12,720
or seated at the table, deep in concentration, 
composing music for the mandolin. Early in the  

809
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:17,680
morning she looked forward with pleasure to the 
moment when he would enter the kitchen and say,  

810
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,760
'Kalimcra Kyria Pelagia. Is Carlo here yet?'  

811
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,720
and in the evening she would actually 
begin to worry if he were a little late.

812
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:33,680
A new source of anger developed, the problem 
being that this time the anger was directed  

813
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:40,400
against herself. It seemed that she just could not 
help looking at him, and he was always catching  

814
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:46,320
her. There was something about him, sitting 
at the table as he went through his paperwork,  

815
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:52,320
that made her look up at him regularly. 
But every time she looked up, he did too,  

816
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:58,000
and she would be caught in his steady gaze as 
surely as if he had grasped her by the wrists.

817
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:04,800
For a few seconds they would look at one another 
and then she would grow red and look down.  

818
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:11,920
Then a few seconds later she would look up, 
and at that moment he would return her glance.  

819
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:19,840
It was impossible and embarrassing. 'I've got 
to stop doing this,' she would tell herself and,  

820
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,160
certain that he was deep in his tasks, 
would look up and get caught again.

821
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,640
She knew he was playing a game with her, 
that she was being played with so gently  

822
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:36,720
that it was impossible to protest. After 
all, she had never caught him looking at her,  

823
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:44,800
so it was all her fault, obviously. Nevertheless, 
it was a game of which he was in absolute command,  

824
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:52,240
and in that sense she was its victim. She decided 
that she would not be the one to look down;  

825
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:59,120
she would wait until he broke away. She searched 
for every last bit of courage and looked up.

826
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,760
They looked at one another for what seemed 
like hours and Pelagia wondered foolishly if  

827
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,320
it was considered acceptable to blink. Her 
eyes began to water and she started seeing  

828
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:18,080
two captains instead of one. He did not 
look away but began to make funny faces,  

829
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:24,240
showing his teeth like a horse, and moving 
the tip of his nose from side to side,  

830
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:31,200
so that Pelagia began a smile, then laughed 
aloud and blinked. Corelli jumped to his feet,  

831
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:38,400
crying, 'I won! I won,' and the doctor looked 
up from his book, exclaiming, 'What? What?'

832
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:45,760
'You cheated,' protested Pelagia, laughing. The 
doctor looked from the captain to his daughter,  

833
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:54,480
adjusted his glasses and sighed. 'Whatever next?' 
he demanded, knowing perfectly well what was next,  

834
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,840
and working out in advance how to deal with it.

835
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,040
Some days later they passed each 
other at the door, she going out  

836
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:10,880
and he returning from work. Unselfconsciously, she 
raised one hand to his left cheek and, in passing,  

837
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:17,520
kissed him on the other. He was astonished and, 
by the time she reached the entrance to the yard,  

838
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:25,680
so was she, because it was not until then that she 
realized what she had done. She stopped as if she  

839
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:31,760
had walked straight into a wall, felt her blood 
rising to the roots of her hair, and realized that  

840
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:38,200
she did not dare look back at him. He called 
out, as she knew he would, 'Kyria Pelagia,'

841
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,840
'What?' she demanded.

842
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,000
'What's for dinner?'

843
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,880
'Don't laugh at me. I thought you were my father. 
I always kiss him like that when he comes in.'

844
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,840
'Very understandable. We are both old and small.'

845
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,600
'If you are going to laugh at me, 
I shall never speak to you again.'

846
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,080
He came out and threw himself 
upon his knees before her.

847
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:09,520
'Oh no,' he cried, 'not that. Shoot me, beat 
me, but don't say you'll never speak to me.'  

848
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,280
He grasped her round the 
knees and pretended to weep.

849
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,760
'The whole village is looking,' 
she protested. 'Stop it at once.'

850
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:25,040
'My heart is broken,' he cried and, taking 
her hand, he began to cover it with kisses.

851
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,520
'Stupid goat, you are insane.'

852
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,560
Corelli laughed and got to his 
feet. 'Come inside,' he said,  

853
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,520
'I've got something very interesting to show you.'

854
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,640
Relieved by this sudden change of subject, 
she followed him through the door,  

855
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,680
but found that he was passing 
her on the way out again.  

856
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,000
He put his hands on each side of her head, kissed 
her dramatically on the forehead, exclaimed,  

857
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:58,800
'I'm sorry, I thought it was the doctor,' and 
then ran away across the yard and down the street.  

858
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:05,440
She stared after him in amazement, making 
every effort not to laugh or smile.
 
 
 

859
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,480
CHAPTER EIGHT

860
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:11,840
Snails

861
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:18,480
When the doctor glanced out of the window and 
saw Captain Corelli creeping up behind Lemoni  

862
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,080
in order to surprise her, he laid down his 
pen and went out into the afternoon sunlight.

863
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,000
'Excuse me, children,' said the doctor, 
ignoring the captain's embarrassment,  

864
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:35,840
'Lemoni, do you remember that you told me you 
know a place where there were lots of snails?  

865
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,040
Can you come round this evening 
and show me where they are?'

866
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,000
Lemoni nodded importantly.

867
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,840
'What's all this about?' asked the captain.

868
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,640
Stiffly, the doctor said, 'Thanks to you Italians,  

869
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,120
there's almost no food. We're going 
out this evening to find snails.'

870
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:01,040
The captain wiped the sweat from his forehead 
and said, 'Permit me to come and help.'

871
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:09,440
So in the evening, an hour before sunset, Pelagia 
and her father, Lemoni and the captain climbed  

872
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:15,040
over a low wall and then began crawling through 
impossibly thick undergrowth in their search for  

873
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:21,920
snails. It became immediately apparent that there 
were quantities of snails everywhere they looked.  

874
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:28,432
The child and three adults became so involved 
in their task that they did not notice they  

875
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:33,840
had become separated. The captain found 
himself on his own and paused for a second,  

876
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,480
realizing that he could not remember 
ever having felt so content.

877
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,720
'Oh, oh no,' came Pelagia's voice from nearby.

878
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,400
Fearing that perhaps she had been hurt, the 
captain crawled towards the place where her  

879
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:55,760
voice had come from and found her unable 
to move, her hair caught in some briars,  

880
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,480
her neck pulled backwards. 
'Don't laugh,' she said crossly.

881
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:06,240
'I'm not laughing,' he said, laughing. 
'I was afraid you were hurt.'

882
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,880
'If you don't help me, I'll 
murder you. Just stop laughing.'

883
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:16,800
'Hold still,' he told her, and reaching 
over her shoulders he began to pull the  

884
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:24,000
hair out piece by piece, as gently as he could. 
'I've done it,' he said, pleased with himself,  

885
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,080
and as he drew back and his lips passed her 
cheek, he kissed it tenderly, before the ear.

886
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,640
She touched her fingertips to 
the place of the kiss, and said,  

887
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,640
shaking her head at him, 'You 
shouldn't have done that.'

888
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,840
He knelt back and held her gaze with his 
own. 'I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.'

889
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:53,360
They looked at one another for a long moment, 
and then Pelagia began to cry. 'What's the  

890
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:59,680
matter?' asked Corelli, frowning in concern as 
Pelagia's tears rolled down her cheeks and fell  

891
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:05,840
into the bucket among the snails. 'You're drowning 
them,' he said, pointing. 'What's the matter?'

892
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:15,280
She gave a sad smile, and started crying again. 
He took her in his arms and patted her back.  

893
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:22,880
Suddenly she said, 'I can't stand it 
any more, not any of it. I'm sorry.'

894
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,400
'Everything is horrible,' agreed the captain, 
wondering if he too might start to cry.  

895
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:37,200
He took her head gently in his hands and 
touched at the tears with his lips. She  

896
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:42,480
gazed at him wonderingly and suddenly they 
found themselves underneath the briars,  

897
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:52,080
in the sunset, surrounded by escaping snails, 
deep in their first, secret, guilty kiss. Hungry  

898
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,160
and desperate, filled with light, they could 
not move away from each other, and when finally  

899
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:03,920
they returned home, they brought back fewer 
snails together than Lemoni brought on her own.

900
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:13,440
They became lovers in the old-fashioned sense. 
Their idea of making love was to kiss in the dark  

901
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:20,800
under the trees or sit on a rock watching the sea. 
He loved her too much to risk her unhappiness,  

902
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:28,240
and she had too much sense to take risks. Again 
and again she had seen the tragedy of girls with  

903
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:33,600
an unwanted child and the poisoned deaths of 
girls who had tried to end their pregnancies.

904
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:41,840
It was hard for Pelagia to love an invader and 
sometimes she shouted at Corelli, her eyes filled  

905
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:48,720
with tears of anger: 'How can you bear to be 
here? Orders? Orders from a madman! Don't you  

906
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:54,720
know you're being used? Why don't you take your 
guns and leave? Don't you know who the enemy is?'

907
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:02,400
At these times the captain listened silently and 
bowed his head, the bitterness of his shame eating  

908
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:08,000
like a worm at the muscles of his heart. But they 
could not stop themselves from loving one another.

909
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,880
Gunter Weber managed to obtain 
a motorcycle for the captain,  

910
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,280
who turned up outside the doctor's 
house one day wearing a cap and goggles.

911
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,800
'Do you want to come for a ride?' he asked.

912
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,720
Pelagia crossed her arms.  

913
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:29,040
'I've never been on one. In fact I've never 
been in a car either and I'm not starting now.'

914
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,280
'I've never been on one either,' 
he said, 'but it's very easy.'

915
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,400
'Somebody might see us,' said Pelagia.

916
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:42,240
The captain solved this problem by bringing 
Pelagia a disguise consisting of a cap,  

917
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:45,840
goggles and a long leather coat, and the next day  

918
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,600
they met around the bend of the road and 
rode off on the bike. They fell off twice,  

919
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:58,080
without injury, and she gripped his waist, 
whitefaced with terror. She climbed off,  

920
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:04,800
shaking, and realized she could not wait to get 
back on; it was splendid to ride a motorcycle.

921
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,680
They went to places where Pelagia could not have 
been recognized and to places that were deserted,  

922
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:17,680
and there she would put her arm through his and 
walk beside him, leaning her weight against his  

923
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:23,600
shoulder, always laughing. With him, she 
would always remember that she laughed.  

924
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:31,280
One day they discovered a ruined hut so old that 
the floor had sunk into the earth. They called it  

925
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:37,200
'Casa Nostra', and in this secret house they would 
spread a blanket and lie embracing and talking.

926
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,680
All their lovers' talk began 
with the phrase, 'After the war'.

927
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:49,360
'After the war, when we are married, let's go to 
America; I've got relatives in Chicago. After the  

928
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,920
war we won't bring up our children with any 
religion, they can make their own minds up  

929
01:33:53,920 --> 01:34:00,240
when they're older. After the war, we'll go all 
over Europe and you can give concerts in hotels  

930
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:06,880
and that's how we'll live. After the war I'll 
love you, I'll love you forever after the war.'

931
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,680
***

932
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:13,520
It was during this period of 
happiness for Pelagia and the captain  

933
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,840
that Dr Iannis was woken one night 
by a gentle tapping on his window.  

934
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:25,760
Puzzled, the doctor looked out and saw a villager 
accompanied by a very tall fair-haired man wearing  

935
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:31,840
the Greek national costume, something that a 
wealthy man might wear once a year on a feast day.  

936
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,760
'We thought you were the man to help him,' the 
villager told the doctor, before departing.  

937
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:46,080
The tall stranger smiled and held out his hand, 
speaking in an extraordinarily old-fashioned Greek  

938
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:51,680
that the doctor found almost impossible 
to understand. The stranger then climbed,  

939
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:57,680
uninvited, through the doctor's window into the 
house, and took a huge radio out of his bag.  

940
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:02,000
Pelagia woke and came into her father's room,  

941
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,880
saw the stranger and put her hand over 
her mouth, wide-eyed with amazement.

942
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,840
'Who's this?' she demanded of her father.

943
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,240
'How am I supposed to know,' 
replied the doctor. 'He  

944
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,880
says he's called Bunnios and he 
talks Greek like a Spanish cow.'

945
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:25,600
The stranger bowed politely and shook 
Pelagia's hand, then smiled charmingly  

946
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,360
and said, 'Greek of the old days. Homer.'

947
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,960
'Ancient Greek?' exclaimed Pelagia,  

948
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:39,040
disbelievingly. The doctor tapped his 
finger to his forehead. 'English?' he asked.

949
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,040
'English,' agreed the man. 
'But, I must beg you...'

950
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,280
'Of course we won't tell anyone.'

951
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:52,000
The man smiled. It had been an awful 
burden to speak the finest ancient Greek  

952
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,120
and not be understood.

953
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:59,920
'We are having an Italian officer sleeping 
in a room,' said the doctor, whose English  

954
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:06,160
was not as good as he liked to believe, 'so we 
are being very quiet, please. Are you a spy?'

955
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,960
The man nodded and asked, 'Do you have any 
clothes I could have? I would be so grateful.'

956
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,520
The Englishman departed for the town of Argostoli 
at dawn, wearing trousers that ended half way  

957
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:27,440
down his legs, and having received some good 
advice from the doctor: 'Look, OK? You accent  

958
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:34,640
terrible-terrible. Not to talk, understand? 
You are quiet until you learning. Also,  

959
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:41,120
you watch out Communists - they thieves. 
Italians OK, Germans not good, see?'

960
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:48,720
Bunnios, whose real name was Bunny Warren, 
soon found an empty hut in the hills where,  

961
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:54,080
using his huge radio, he reported in 
great detail to his British masters,  

962
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:58,560
informing them of troop movements 
in the area. He also set himself  

963
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,360
the task of learning modern Greek, and was 
assisted in this by the willing islanders.

964
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,520
***

965
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,080
The captain's opera group, La Scala, became 
accustomed to meeting in the doctor's house.

966
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,720
'Your soldiers are stealing from 
people's vegetable patches, when  

967
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:19,840
we're dying of hunger already,' said the doctor 
to Corelli one day, when the group was there.

968
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:24,480
'If it's true, they will be 
punished,' the captain replied,  

969
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,040
already deeply shamed and embarrassed 
by the fact that some nights previously  

970
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:34,320
someone, obviously an Italian 
soldier, had stolen Pelagia's goat.

971
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:39,520
'We Germans do not do this,' said Gunter 
Weber, with a pleased expression on his face.

972
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,120
'Germans can't sing,' replied Corelli,  

973
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:48,400
'and anyway, I'll get this investigated 
and I'll put a stop to it. It's too bad.'

974
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:54,800
Weber smiled. 'You are very famous for 
defending the rights of the Greeks.  

975
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,600
I wonder if sometimes you 
understand why you are here.'

976
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,520
'I try to think of it as a holiday. I 
don't have your advantages, Gunter.'

977
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,880
'Advantages?'

978
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:11,680
'Yes. I don't have the advantage of thinking 
that other races are inferior to mine.'

979
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:17,360
'It's a question of science,' said Weber. 
'You can't alter a scientific fact.'

980
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,480
Corelli frowned. 'Science?  

981
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:26,160
I don't care about science. Moral 
principles are important, not science.'

982
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,720
'We disagree,' said Weber in a friendly fashion. 
'Science tells us that the strong survive.  

983
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,960
Strength needs no excuses and 
doesn't have to give reasons.'

984
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,680
'Science is about facts, and 
morality is about values,'  

985
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,840
said Carlo, who had been listening closely.

986
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,880
'It's also a matter of being able to 
live with yourself,' Corelli added.

987
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:55,200
'You're a good man,' said Gunter, 'I admit 
it. Why don't I get my record player from  

988
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:01,760
my car and we can all sing with Marlene 
Dietrich.' He went to his car and proudly  

989
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,560
returned with the record player, which he 
put down on the table. He put on the record  

990
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:13,280
and Dietrich began to sing, her voice full of 
the sadness of knowledge, the longing for love.

991
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:22,640
'Oh,' exclaimed Weber, 'her voice makes 
me melt,' and Corelli said, 'Antonia likes  

992
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:28,880
this. She's going to sing.' He began to 
accompany the song, playing so beautifully  

993
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:34,160
that in the village people stopped what they were 
doing and listened to Corelli fill the night.  

994
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:39,840
Pelagia left the kitchen, her form 
ghostlike in the light of the candles.  

995
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,760
'Please play that song again,' she 
asked Weber. 'It was so beautiful.'

996
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:53,520
'Do you like it?' asked Weber, and she nodded. 
'All right,' he continued, 'when I go home after  

997
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,240
the war, I'll leave it with you. It would 
please me very much for you to have it.'

998
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:05,200
Pelagia was delighted. She looked at the smiling 
boy with his smart uniform and blond hair  

999
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:11,360
and was filled with pleasure. 'You're so sweet,' 
she said, and kissed him naturally on the cheek,  

1000
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,760
so that the boys of La Scala cheered and 
Weber went red and hid his eyes with his hand.

1001
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,240
***

1002
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:25,360
The time came when the doctor decided that it was 
necessary to discuss certain matters with Pelagia.  

1003
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,360
'There's something I have to 
talk to you about,' he told her.  

1004
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,320
'It has not escaped my notice that you 
have fallen in love with the captain.'

1005
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:42,400
She went violently red and looked terribly 
shocked. 'The captain?' she said foolishly.

1006
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:50,720
He began a long speech. 'It's not that I don't 
like the captain. Of course, he's a little mad,  

1007
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:56,560
which is quite simply explained by the fact that 
he is Italian. In fact I like him very much,  

1008
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:02,640
but you must remember that you are 
engaged to Mandras, and technically,  

1009
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:08,400
the captain is an enemy. Can you imagine the pain 
you will suffer when people discover that you  

1010
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:15,120
have given up the love of a Greek in favour of an 
invader? People will throw stones at you and spit,  

1011
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:20,400
you know that, don't you? You would have to move 
away to Italy if you wanted to stay with him,  

1012
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:26,080
because here you might not be safe. Are you 
prepared to leave this island and this people?

1013
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:33,200
'And another thing. Love is a temporary madness. 
When it ends you have to work out whether your  

1014
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:38,480
roots have so joined together that it is 
unimaginable that you should ever separate.  

1015
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:46,960
Because that is what love is. Love isn't 
breathlessness, it is not excitement,  

1016
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:52,320
it is not lying awake at night imagining that 
he is kissing every part of your body. No,  

1017
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:58,720
don't look so embarrassed, I'm telling you 
some truths. That is just being "in love",  

1018
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:05,360
which any fool can do. Love itself is what is 
left over when being in love has burned away.

1019
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,840
'I say to you that to marry the captain is 
impossible until our country is free again.  

1020
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:18,400
I would be happy for you to do this, but this 
means that you have a love that will be delayed.  

1021
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:26,320
Pelagia, you know as well as I do that love 
delayed means that physical passion increases. No,  

1022
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:32,320
don't look at me like that. Do you think I don't 
know that young girls can be eaten by desire?  

1023
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:39,200
Imagine if you got pregnant, what would you do? 
I would not assist in the murder of an innocent.  

1024
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,920
Would you have the child, and then find that no 
man would ever marry you? I would not abandon you  

1025
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:52,160
as long as I live, even under such circumstances. 
But imagine if I should die. What then?'

1026
01:42:53,920 --> 01:43:01,200
Pelagia had never felt so crushed in all her 
life and wept bitterly, but when she looked up,  

1027
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,680
she found her father looking 
at her sympathetically.  

1028
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,840
'You make everything sound so disgusting,' 
she said. 'You don't know how it is.'

1029
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,040
'I went through a lot of this 
with your mother,' he replied.  

1030
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,600
'She was engaged to someone 
else. I do know how it is.'

1031
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:22,080
'You don't forbid everything 
then?' she asked hopefully.

1032
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:30,560
'No, I don't forbid everything. I say you 
must be careful and act honourably to Mandras.  

1033
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:35,520
Don't give in to your desires, that's 
all. The captain is a good man.  

1034
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,040
Pray for our freedom, Pelagia, because 
then everything becomes possible.'

1035
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:49,600
Pelagia stood up to go and her father said, 'I 
did not intend to upset you. I was young once.'

1036
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,120
'Not everything was different in your 
day, then,' she said as she left the room,  

1037
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,480
and her father smiled, pleased that his 
words had not crushed his daughter's spirit.

1038
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,960
***

1039
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:07,840
The doctor and the captain were sitting indoors 
at the kitchen table while the latter was removing  

1040
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:13,840
a broken string from his mandolin. The doctor 
leaned back and sighed, then suddenly asked,  

1041
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:20,480
'Are you and Pelagia planning to be married? 
As her father, I think I have a right to know.'

1042
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:26,400
The captain was so surprised by the frankness 
of the question that he was unable to think  

1043
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:32,560
of a reply. His relationship with Pelagia 
had only been able to proceed on the basis  

1044
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:38,080
that no one ever brought the issue out into 
the open. He looked at the doctor anxiously.

1045
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:43,360
'You can't live here,' said the 
doctor. He pointed to the mandolin.  

1046
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:49,440
'If you want to be a musician, this is the 
last place to be. And I don't think that  

1047
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:55,280
Pelagia could live in Italy. She is a Greek. 
She would die like a flower without sunlight.'

1048
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:01,920
'Ah,' said the captain, for the 
lack of any intelligent remark.

1049
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,440
'It's true,' said the doctor. 'I know you 
have not thought about it. Italians always  

1050
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:16,000
act without thinking. Anyway, Pelagia is 
a Greek, that's my point. So can it work?'

1051
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,080
There was a silence between the two 
men. 'I love her,' said Corelli at last,  

1052
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:26,720
as if this were the answer to 
the problem, which to him it was.

1053
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:32,640
'I know that. You'd have to live here, 
that's all,' said the doctor. 'You might  

1054
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:36,160
have to choose between loving 
her and becoming a musician.'

1055
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:44,400
The doctor left the room, more for dramatic effect 
than for any other purpose, and then came back in.  

1056
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:49,600
'And another thing. This is a very ancient land  

1057
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:55,440
and we've had nothing except murder for two 
thousand years. We've got so many places full  

1058
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:01,760
of bitter ghosts that anyone who goes near them 
or lives in them becomes heartless or insane.  

1059
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,960
I don't believe in God, captain, 
but I do believe in ghosts.  

1060
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:13,760
And there will be many more deaths. It's only a 
question of time. So don't make any plans.'
 
 
 

1061
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:18,800
CHAPTER NINE

1062
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,480
Autumn 1943: Betrayal

1063
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:30,400
The Allies invaded Sicily, Italy's southern 
island, and so they betrayed their most  

1064
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:36,960
loyal and courageous friend, Greece, and 
did not come to its aid. The angry Greeks  

1065
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,800
demanded to know why their country, which was 
occupied by the Italians, had been ignored,  

1066
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:49,760
and received no answers. The Allies had abandoned 
Greece, the little nation that had given Europe  

1067
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:56,320
its culture and its heart. To make matters 
worse, during this period the Greek Communists  

1068
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:02,800
were committing unimaginably vicious acts, but 
for a long time the world did not believe it.

1069
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:08,480
On Cephallonia, the Italian 
soldiers listened to their radios  

1070
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:13,120
and followed the course of Allied progress 
up Italy, their homeland, while the German  

1071
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:19,840
soldiers were angered and disgusted by the Italian 
army's lack of resistance to the Allies. Corelli  

1072
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:26,400
and his brother officers sensed ice in the air, 
and visits between the Germans and the Italians  

1073
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:35,920
became less frequent. When Weber turned up at 
meetings of La Scala, he seemed quiet and distant.

1074
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,520
'What happens,' Corelli asked 
Pelagia with a troubled look,  

1075
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,560
'when we have to surrender before the Germans do?'

1076
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,160
'We'll get married.'

1077
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:51,120
He shook his head sadly. 'It's going to be a 
complete mess. There's no chance of the British  

1078
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:56,880
coming. They're going straight for Rome. No 
one will save us unless we save ourselves.  

1079
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,600
We should attack the Germans on the island 
now, while there aren't many of them,  

1080
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:07,520
but our generals don't do anything. 
They say we should trust the Germans.'

1081
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,680
'Don't you trust them?'

1082
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,680
'I'm not stupid.'

1083
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,200
'Come inside,' she said, 'my father's out.'

1084
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:21,360
'There's no point. My mind is just 
a blank that's filled with worry.'

1085
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,280
Corelli came to the doctor's house less often,  

1086
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,880
and day and night he trained his men, working 
them hard in the terrible August heat,  

1087
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:36,800
so that the sweat ran down their faces and arms, 
and the sun burned the flesh of their shoulders.  

1088
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:42,400
They did not complain. They knew that 
the captain was right to prepare them.

1089
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,240
He himself stopped playing the mandolin; there was 
so little time for it that when he picked it up  

1090
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:57,360
it felt foreign in his fingers in comparison with 
a gun. He went home to Pelagia on his motorbike at  

1091
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:03,680
times when her father was likely to be out, and 
he brought her bread, honey, bottles of wine,  

1092
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:09,520
a photograph signed on the back with the words 
'After the War...' written on it in his elegant,  

1093
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:15,680
foreign-looking handwriting, and he brought her 
his tired, grey face, and his saddened eyes.

1094
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:23,760
'My poor darling,' she would say, her arms about 
his neck, 'don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,'  

1095
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:29,760
and he would move back a little and say, 
'Koritsimou, let me just look at you.'

1096
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:37,440
And then came the time when Carlo was listening 
to the radio, trying to find a signal. It was 8  

1097
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,840
September, and the evenings had become 
much cooler than they had been before.  

1098
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:49,680
Carlo had recently been thinking about Francesco 
and about the horror of Albania, and now more than  

1099
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:55,520
ever he knew that it had all been a waste, and 
that his time in Cephallonia had been a holiday  

1100
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:03,840
from a war that was going to destroy his life once 
more, perhaps forever. He found a voice and turned  

1101
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:10,640
up the volume: '... all aggressive acts by Italian 
Armed Forces against the forces of the British and  

1102
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:17,760
the Americans will cease at once, everywhere.' The 
Italians had formally surrendered to the Allies.

1103
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:24,880
Outside, the bells of the island began to 
ring; they rang all over the island in the  

1104
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:33,680
towns of Argostoli, Lixouri, Soulari, Dorizata. 
On the radio there was a message from Eisenhower,  

1105
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:38,880
the American president: '... All Italians 
who take steps to rid themselves of the  

1106
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:44,080
German presence in their country will have 
the assistance and support of the Allies...'

1107
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:51,840
Carlo ran out and found Corelli just arriving on 
his bike, a great cloud of blue smoke behind him.  

1108
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:58,960
'Antonio, Antonio, it's all over, and the 
Allies have promised to help us,' he cried.  

1109
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:06,480
He threw his enormous arms around the man he loved 
and picked him up, dancing in a circle. 'Carlo,  

1110
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:13,120
Carlo,' the captain cried, 'put me down. Don't 
get so excited. The Allies don't care about us.  

1111
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:19,840
We're in Greece, remember. Carlo, you don't 
know your own strength. You half killed me.'

1112
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:25,120
'They'll help us,' said Carlo, 
but Corelli shook his head.  

1113
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:31,440
'If we don't act now, we're finished. We've got to 
get the Germans on the island to surrender to us.'

1114
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:38,080
That night the Italian warships in the 
harbours of the island sailed for home,  

1115
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:45,040
without informing anyone they were going, or 
taking with them a single Italian soldier. In  

1116
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:51,200
a terrible act of cowardice, the warships withdrew 
their protection from the soldiers on the island,  

1117
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:57,840
so that the German soldiers laughed and 
Corelli's men smelled betrayal. Corelli waited  

1118
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:02,640
at the telephone for orders, and when 
none came he fell asleep in his chair.

1119
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:09,200
Carlo, now realizing that Corelli's 
pessimistic predictions were probably correct,  

1120
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:14,800
wrote his captain a long letter in which 
he declared his undying love for him  

1121
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:21,600
and also his unselfish hope that Corelli would 
find true happiness with Pelagia. Strangely  

1122
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:27,440
convinced that he was going to die soon, Carlo 
added this letter to his other writings and  

1123
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:31,680
brought them to the doctor's house, with the 
request that his papers should be placed in  

1124
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:36,640
the hiding-hole under the trapdoor and only 
opened and read in the event of his death.

1125
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:45,040
Like Corelli, Gunter Weber also slept from time to 
time in his chair, waiting for orders, desperately  

1126
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:52,560
tired and with all his confidence gone. He 
missed his Italian friends, but worse than that,  

1127
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:59,680
his country was losing and he no longer felt proud 
and full of strength. He felt inferior and so  

1128
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:05,760
betrayed by his country's allies, the Italians, 
that if he had been a woman he would have wept.  

1129
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:12,000
He tried to pray but the words 
turned bitter in his mouth.

1130
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,600
Corelli stopped his motorcycle 
on his way back to camp  

1131
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:21,760
and beneath the shade of a tree, by a ruined wall, 
he sat and thought about going back to Italy,  

1132
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:30,560
about surviving, about Pelagia. The truth 
was that he had no home and that was why  

1133
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:36,000
he never talked about it. Mussolini 
had forced his family to move to Libya,  

1134
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
and there they had been attacked by rebels and had 
died, while he lay in hospital with a high fever.

1135
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,680
Of all the relatives' houses where 
he had stayed, which one was home?  

1136
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:54,800
He had no family except his soldiers and his 
mandolin, and his heart was there in Greece.  

1137
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:02,720
Had he suffered so much pain, so much loneliness, 
had he finally found a place to be, only to have  

1138
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:09,280
it torn away? His memories of his parents were 
as thin and indefinite as those of a ghost,  

1139
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:15,280
and for the first time he began to feel as 
if Pelagia already belonged to his past.  

1140
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:21,360
He thought about dying and wondered how 
long Pelagia would weep, and what a shame  

1141
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:27,440
it would be to spoil her lovely flesh with 
tears; it broke his heart to imagine it.  

1142
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:35,840
He wanted to reach out from beyond the grave and 
comfort her, even though he was not yet dead.

1143
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:41,040
He went to the doctor's house and asked 
them to look after his mandolin, and Pelagia  

1144
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:44,080
wrapped it in a blanket and put 
it under the hole in the floor.  

1145
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:49,840
They told him about Carlo's visit, and how 
he had left a thick pile of papers with them.  

1146
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:56,960
The captain had not known that Carlo had ambitions 
to be a writer and was curious about the content  

1147
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:02,560
of the big man's papers. He thought that 
Pelagia looked very thin and almost ill,  

1148
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:08,320
and when she sadly stroked his cheek, he 
almost did not know how to prevent his tears.

1149
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,800
***

1150
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:15,680
After Italy's surrender to the Allies, 
General Gandin, leader of the Italian troops  

1151
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:20,720
on Cephallonia, suffered terrible indecision 
about the course of action he should take.  

1152
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:26,880
He had two choices. Compared to the 
number of Italian soldiers on the island,  

1153
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,400
there were many fewer German 
troops, and he could insist  

1154
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:35,760
that the German soldiers laid down their arms 
and surrendered to the superior Italian forces.  

1155
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:42,000
If the Germans rejected this, then the 
Italian troops could theoretically attack  

1156
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,920
and overcome them. But Gandin knew that he 
would receive no support from the Allies,  

1157
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:54,880
and moreover, that he would have neither air nor 
sea support from his own country. He knew that the  

1158
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:00,720
Germans still had a large number of bomber planes 
based in mainland Greece, and the thought of  

1159
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:06,240
those death machines screaming over the island as 
they dropped their bombs filled him with horror.

1160
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:14,000
These thoughts led the General to the second 
option, which was to surrender to the Germans,  

1161
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,520
on condition that the latter gave written 
guarantees of the safety of the Italian soldiers  

1162
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,800
on the island. This would mean trusting 
the Germans not to break their promises  

1163
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:32,240
and attack the Italians. It was this second 
route that Gandin was tempted to take. He was,  

1164
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:37,600
in a strange way, a man of honour, and still 
considered the Germans to be his allies.

1165
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:45,120
Unlike General Gandin, the Italian troops on 
Cephallonia knew exactly what should be done.  

1166
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:51,600
They heard from the radio that the Germans, as 
they withdrew in Italy, were killing and looting  

1167
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:57,120
along the way and they could see no reason why 
the Germans would not do the same in Cephallonia,  

1168
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:04,480
given the chance. While Gandin delayed, unable to 
make up his mind, and his soldiers became almost  

1169
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:10,480
crazy with anger and fear, the Germans quietly 
flew more arms and troops to the island.

1170
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:18,720
Finally General Gandin came to a decision. Despite 
the universal demand of his men that the Germans  

1171
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:23,760
should be forced to surrender, the General 
agreed with the German leaders on the island  

1172
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:29,840
that the Italians should be allowed to keep their 
weapons and peacefully leave Cephallonia. There  

1173
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:36,560
were no ships, however, to take the Italians away, 
a point which did not seem significant to Gandin.  

1174
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:43,200
Some of the Italian troops, guessing what was 
likely to happen, became deeply depressed,  

1175
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:49,920
while others, like Corelli, developed an 
iron determination and prepared their men  

1176
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,640
to the last degree for the terrible battle 
that they were certain lay ahead of them.

1177
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:01,040
When the German bomber planes arrived, 
early in the afternoon, tipping their wings,  

1178
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:09,680
it was almost a relief to the waiting Italians. 
Now everything was clear; it was at last obvious  

1179
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:14,560
that the Germans had betrayed them and that 
every Italian soldier would have to fight for  

1180
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:20,080
his life. Gunter Weber knew that he would 
have to turn his weapons on his friends.  

1181
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:26,240
Corelli knew that his musician's fingers, 
so well accustomed to the arts of peace,  

1182
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:34,080
must now tighten around a gun. General Gandin 
knew too late that he had made the wrong decision  

1183
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:40,800
and that, as a result, his men were going 
to die. Pelagia knew that a war that had  

1184
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:47,840
always been somewhere else would now settle 
upon her home and turn its stones to dust.

1185
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:55,040
The German planes attacked Argostoli first 
because that was where most Italian troops  

1186
01:58:55,040 --> 01:59:00,080
were concentrated. Gandin made the 
foolish mistake of bringing his troops  

1187
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:05,840
into the town in increasing numbers, and this 
made it easier for the Germans to isolate and  

1188
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:13,760
cut them down. Houses were crushed by the bombs 
and soldiers and islanders died in large numbers.  

1189
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:20,640
More and more German soldiers were flown in, and 
spread all over the island, killing as they went.  

1190
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:27,120
Everyone knew that no ships or planes would come 
to aid an island of Cephallonia's insignificance.  

1191
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:33,920
On a hillside, Bunny Warren sat by his 
radio and tried to persuade his superiors  

1192
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:38,800
that they should provide the Italians with 
air and sea support, but without success.

1193
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,280
***

1194
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:47,120
Dr Iannis and his daughter sat side by side 
at their kitchen table, unable to sleep,  

1195
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:54,320
holding each others' hands. Pelagia was 
weeping. The doctor wanted to relight his pipe,  

1196
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:57,440
but out of respect for his daughter's feelings  

1197
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:04,640
he allowed his hands to stay in hers, and he 
repeated, 'Koritsimou, I am sure he is all right.'

1198
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:09,760
'But we haven't seen him for days,' 
she cried. 'I just know he's dead.'

1199
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:14,640
'If he was dead someone would have 
told us, someone from La Scala.  

1200
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,440
They were all nice boys, they would let us know.'

1201
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:25,840
'Were?' she repeated. 'You think they're all 
dead? You think they're dead too, don't you?'

1202
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:29,200
'Oh God,' the doctor sighed.

1203
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:37,360
It was on the morning of 22 September that Captain 
Antonio Corelli, knowing that his leaders were  

1204
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:43,760
planning to surrender to the Germans, having had 
no sleep for three days, climbed on his motorcycle  

1205
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:49,840
and sped towards Pelagia's house. He threw 
himself into her arms, resting his burning  

1206
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:56,560
eyes upon her shoulder, and told her, 'We 
are lost. The British have betrayed us.'

1207
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:02,080
She begged him to stay, to hide in 
the house, in the hole in the floor,  

1208
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:06,800
with his mandolin and Carlo's papers, 
but he took her face in his hands,  

1209
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:12,880
kissed her without the tears that he was too 
tired to weep, and then rocked her in his arms,  

1210
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,640
squeezing her so tightly that she 
thought that her bones would crack.  

1211
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:24,320
He kissed her again and said, 'Koritsimou, 
this is the last time I shall ever see you.  

1212
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:29,920
There has been no honour in this 
war, but I have to be with my boys.'  

1213
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:36,160
With his head hanging down, 
he told her, 'Koritsimou,  

1214
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:44,080
I am going to die. Remember me to your father. And 
I thank God I have lived long enough to love you.'

1215
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:51,200
She watched him go as he drove away on his 
motorcycle, the dust cloud surrounding his  

1216
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:57,920
head, then she went inside and sat at the 
kitchen table, terror gripping her heart.
 
 
 

1217
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:03,040
CHAPTER TEN

1218
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:04,880
The Order to Kill

1219
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:12,880
Gunter Weber stood before his superior officer 
and, his face hard with determination, said,  

1220
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:20,000
'Sir, I must request that you give this task 
to someone else. I cannot carry it out.'

1221
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:25,600
His superior raised an eyebrow but 
somehow failed to feel any anger.  

1222
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:31,840
The truth was that in this position he 
hoped that he would have done the same.

1223
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,480
'Why not?' he asked.

1224
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,520
'Sir, it is against international 
law to murder prisoners of war.  

1225
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:44,000
It is also wrong. I must request to be excused.'

1226
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,960
'They have betrayed us, their allies.'

1227
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:53,440
'I realize that, but I am not a criminal, 
sir, and I do not wish to become one.'

1228
02:02:54,720 --> 02:03:03,280
The officer sighed. 'War is a dirty business, you 
know that. We all have to do terrible things. For  

1229
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:11,200
example, I like you and I admire you for taking 
this position, but I must remind you that the  

1230
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:17,680
punishment for refusing to obey an order is 
death. I don't state this as a threat but as  

1231
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:25,520
a fact of life. You know this as well as I do.' He 
walked to the window and then turned. 'They're all  

1232
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:31,840
going to be shot anyway. Why add your death to 
theirs? It would be a waste of a fine officer.'

1233
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:38,640
Gunter Weber swallowed hard and his 
lips trembled so that he found it hard  

1234
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:46,400
to speak. At last he said, 'I request that my 
protest is recorded and put in my file, sir.'

1235
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:51,280
'Your request is granted,' said 
the officer and left the room.

1236
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,840
Weber leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette,  

1237
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:59,760
but his hands shook so much 
that he immediately dropped it.

1238
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:07,600
'Let's sing, boys,' said Antonio Corelli, looking 
round the inside of the truck where his men sat,  

1239
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:14,080
watched by expressionless German soldiers. 
One of the Italians was already tearful,  

1240
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:17,120
others were praying, their 
heads bowed down to their knees.  

1241
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:24,240
Corelli felt strangely happy as if he were 
drunk with tiredness and the absolute certainty  

1242
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:32,720
of death. Why not smile in the face of death? 
'Let's sing, boys,' he repeated, 'Carlo, sing.'

1243
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:40,640
Carlo gazed at him with eyes full of endless 
sorrow, and began very softly to sing a song  

1244
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:47,840
from an opera they all loved, Madame Butterfly, 
and soon others joined in, when they felt able to.  

1245
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:54,080
The tune comforted them, and it was 
easier to sing than to think on death;  

1246
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,800
it gave the heart something to do.

1247
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:05,520
When the truck arrived, Gunter Weber's knees 
began to shake. Almost before it had arrived,  

1248
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:09,360
it seemed that he had known that life had 
called him to the killing of his friends.  

1249
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:16,560
He had not expected them to arrive singing the 
tune that he and La Scala had sung together  

1250
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:21,840
late at night at the doctor's house, nor had he 
expected them to jump so lightly from the truck.  

1251
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:29,680
He ordered a German soldier to put his friends 
against the wall, lit another cigarette and turned  

1252
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:38,000
away, but finally he turned again and approached 
the Italians. More than half of them were praying,  

1253
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,160
kneeling in the soil, and others wept like 
children at a death. Antonio Corelli and  

1254
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:49,760
Carlo Guercio were embracing. Weber reached for 
his packet of cigarettes and approached them.

1255
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:58,800
'Cigarette?' he asked them, and Corelli took one, 
Carlo refusing. Corelli looked at Weber and said,  

1256
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:03,120
'Your hands are trembling and your legs.'

1257
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:08,560
'Antonio, I am very sorry, I tried...'

1258
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:15,840
Corelli sucked on his cigarette and said, 'I 
am sure you did, Gunter, I know how it goes.'

1259
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,280
Weber's face trembled with the 
effort of hiding his tears,  

1260
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,640
and at last he said suddenly, 'Forgive me.'

1261
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:29,840
Carlo made a sound of disgust in his throat 
and said, 'You will never be forgiven.'  

1262
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:34,960
But Corelli put his hand up to 
silence his friend and said quietly,  

1263
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:40,720
'Gunter, I forgive you. If I do not, who will?'

1264
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:49,520
Weber held out his hand. 'Goodbye, Gunter,' 
said Corelli, taking it. Allowing his hand  

1265
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:54,960
to remain in his former friend's, he shook 
it briefly one final time and released it.  

1266
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:59,040
He linked an arm through 
Carlo's, and smiled up at him.  

1267
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:06,320
'Come,' he said, 'we two have been companions 
in life. Let's go together to heaven.'

1268
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:16,240
It was a beautiful day to die. A few soft clouds 
hid the top of Mount Aenos and nearby a goatbell  

1269
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:22,560
rang. Corelli realized that his own legs were 
shaking and that he could do nothing to prevent  

1270
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:29,200
it. He thought about Pelagia, with her dark 
eyes, her passionate nature, her black hair.  

1271
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:35,360
He saw her clearly in his mind's eye: making 
a blanket that grew smaller every day;  

1272
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:42,480
arm in arm with her father, returning from the 
sea; kissing Gunter Weber on the cheek at the  

1273
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:50,560
offer of the record player. Pelagia, whose form 
had been so sweetly rounded, now so pale and thin.

1274
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:58,720
A Croatian soldier approached Weber, a man who, in 
Weber's opinion, had a dangerously violent nature.  

1275
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:04,480
The Croatian said, 'Sir, more 
will be arriving. We can't delay.'

1276
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:10,160
'Very well,' said Weber. He 
closed his eyes and prayed,  

1277
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:13,920
a prayer without words to a God who did not care.

1278
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:20,880
There was nothing formal about the killings, and 
the victims were not lined up against the wall  

1279
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:28,080
or made to face forwards. Many of them were 
left on their knees, praying or weeping or  

1280
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:36,480
begging for mercy. Some stood smoking as if at a 
party, and Carlo stood next to Corelli, glad to  

1281
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:43,440
die at last and determined to die a soldier's 
death. Corelli put one hand in his pocket to  

1282
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:49,840
steady the shaking of his leg, and deeply breathed 
the Cephallonian air that held Pelagia's breath.

1283
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:55,360
The German boys heard the command 
to fire and fired in disbelief.  

1284
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:02,000
Those of them whose eyes were open aimed 
wide or high, or aimed to avoid a death.  

1285
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:08,160
The Croatian soldier shot to kill, 
firing rapidly and taking careful aim.

1286
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:15,760
Weber's head spun. His former friends were 
leaping and dancing in the rain of bullets,  

1287
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:22,880
were crying out, stumbling to their knees, arms 
waving, their mouths filled with blood. But  

1288
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:31,120
what no one had seen, even Weber, was that at the 
order to fire, Carlo had stepped quickly sideways  

1289
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:37,520
in front of Corelli, and had gripped the latter's 
wrists so tightly that he was unable to move.  

1290
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:42,160
Corelli stared wonderingly 
into the middle of Carlo's back  

1291
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:47,760
as great holes burst though from inside the 
latter's body, releasing fountains of blood.

1292
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:56,960
Carlo stood unbroken as one bullet after another 
entered his chest like white-hot knives. He stood  

1293
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:04,800
perfectly still and counted to thirty, looked up 
at the sky and then threw himself over backwards.  

1294
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:12,720
Corelli lay beneath him, unable to move, 
so astonished by this extraordinary,  

1295
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:16,800
saintly act of love that he did not 
hear the Croatian soldier's voice.

1296
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:25,360
'Italians, it's all over. If any of you are 
living, stand up now and you will go free.'

1297
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:31,680
He did not see the two or three 
stand up and see them fall again  

1298
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:36,960
as the Croatian shot them down. Then 
he heard the single shots as Weber,  

1299
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:42,880
drunk with horror, wandered among the dead, 
putting those still living out of their pain.  

1300
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:50,800
Next to his head he saw Weber's boot and he 
saw Weber bend down and look directly into his  

1301
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:57,520
eyes where he lay trapped beneath Carlo's great 
weight. He saw the shaking gun approach his face,  

1302
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:05,920
he saw the ocean of sorrow in Webers eyes, 
and then he saw the gun withdrawn, unfired.  

1303
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:12,560
He tried to breathe more freely, and realized 
he was having difficulty, not only because of  

1304
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:18,480
Carlo's weight but because the bullets that had 
passed through his friend had also struck himself.

1305
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:20,800
***

1306
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:27,120
Corelli lay beneath his friend for hours, their 
blood mixing in the soil, in their uniforms,  

1307
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:34,720
in their flesh. It was not until evening that 
Velisarios came across the heap of tragic bodies,  

1308
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:40,560
and recognized the man as big as himself who had 
once reached a hand across the barrier of war  

1309
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:48,800
and offered him a cigarette. He looked down into 
the vacant and staring eyes, reached down and  

1310
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:55,280
tried to close them. He failed, and was struck by 
the horror of leaving such a brother to the wind  

1311
02:11:55,280 --> 02:12:04,400
and birds. He knelt down and with a huge effort he 
lifted Carlo from the ground, and, as he did so,  

1312
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:10,560
he saw the mad captain who was staying at the 
doctor's, the one whose 'secret' love for Pelagia  

1313
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:17,840
was known and discussed by everyone on the island. 
The man's eyes were not vacant and they blinked.  

1314
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:26,000
The lips moved. 'Doctor,' 
said the dying man. 'Pelagia.'

1315
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:34,240
The strong man put Carlo against the wall. 
Then he carefully picked the captain up,  

1316
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:39,200
felt how light he was, and set off 
across the stony fields to save his life.

1317
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:46,080
Nobody knows the exact number of the Italian 
dead that lay upon the earth of Cephallonia,  

1318
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:54,800
but at least four thousand were murdered, possibly 
nine thousand. The evidence was lost in flame,  

1319
02:12:54,800 --> 02:13:00,080
because the Germans, displaying knowledge 
of their guilt, burnt the bodies, cutting  

1320
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:06,960
down trees that were a thousand years old to 
make the fires. They changed flesh into smoke,  

1321
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:13,440
they put one dead boy after another across 
their shoulders and tipped them into the flames,  

1322
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:18,800
working until their legs weakened and 
the flames became too hot to approach.

1323
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:24,480
One of the bodies that they burned 
was the body of General Gandin,  

1324
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:32,480
who trusted his enemies and tried to save his men. 
Another who died at this time was Father Arsenios,  

1325
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:37,920
the priest from Pelagia's village. He wandered 
among the bodies and the flames until he was  

1326
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:43,840
so mad with grief that he began to beat the heads 
and shoulders of the German soldiers with a stick.  

1327
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:52,160
At first the soldiers, who had murdered thousands, 
did not know what to do, but then an officer came  

1328
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:58,800
up behind Arsenios and fired a single shot into 
the back of his neck, exploding his brains.

1329
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:07,040
Men and women and the few Italian soldiers who 
had escaped approached the fires as closely as the  

1330
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:13,440
heat permitted and began to pull away the bodies 
at the edge of the fires. All of them thought the  

1331
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:20,240
same things: 'Is this what it will be like under 
the Germans? How many of these boys could there  

1332
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:27,600
have been? How many of these boys did I know? Can 
I imagine how it is to die of bleeding, slowly?'

1333
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:34,560
At dawn a thick, black cloud hung 
over the land and blocked out the sun,  

1334
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:39,840
and the people returned to their 
houses and locked their doors.
 
 
 

1335
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,320
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1336
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:45,920
An Operation

1337
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:53,840
When the door was suddenly kicked open just as 
it was getting dark, Pelagia's first thought  

1338
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:58,080
was that it was the Germans, since she 
knew that all the Italians were dead.  

1339
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:05,600
Like everybody else she had heard the sounds 
of battle and seen truck after truck pass by,  

1340
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:11,920
bearing either cheering German soldiers 
or the dead bodies of Italians. At night  

1341
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:17,280
she had gone out with her father, whose cheeks 
were trembling with tears of anger and pity,  

1342
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:21,920
and looked for lives to save among 
those bodies abandoned in the fires.

1343
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:28,880
It had left her speechless, not with 
fear or sorrow, but with emptiness.

1344
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:35,280
When the door flew open she was 
frightened, but she had nevertheless,  

1345
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:39,520
somehow been expecting it. Her 
gun was ready in her pocket.  

1346
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:47,760
She stood up, her hand tightening around the 
gun, her face colourless, and saw Velisarios,  

1347
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:53,280
breathing hard. He advanced to the table 
and gently placed his burden on it.

1348
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:56,480
'Who is it?' asked Pelagia.

1349
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:01,520
'He's alive,' said Velisarios. 
'It's the mad captain.'

1350
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:08,880
She bent down to look with eyes full of both 
horror and hope, but she did not recognize him;  

1351
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:15,360
there were too many holes, too much blood. 
She wanted to touch him but withdrew her hand.  

1352
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:18,800
Where does one touch a man like this?  

1353
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:27,600
The body opened its eyes and the 
mouth smiled. 'Kalimera, koritsimou,'  

1354
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:32,161
it said, and she recognized the voice.

1355
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,479
'It's the evening,' she said foolishly.  

1356
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:40,160
'Kalispera, then,' he 
whispered and closed his eyes.

1357
02:16:42,399 --> 02:16:46,799
Pelagia looked up at Velisarios, her 
eyes wide and desperate, and said,  

1358
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:53,439
'Velisarios, you have never done a greater thing. 
I'm going to get my father. Stay with him.'  

1359
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:58,320
She found her father at the 
kapheneion and dragged him out,  

1360
02:16:58,319 --> 02:17:02,880
ignoring the angry stares of the other 
men, and Kokolios, who roared at her.

1361
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,040
The doctor looked at the body and knew 
he had never seen anything worse. There  

1362
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:16,560
was enough blood to fill the veins of a horse. 
'It would be kinder to kill him,' he said, but  

1363
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:23,680
before Velisarios could say, 'I thought so too,' 
Pelagia began beating her father with both hands.  

1364
02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:31,200
And so water was put on to boil and the rags 
of the captain's uniform were gently cut away.

1365
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:35,680
Dr Iannis complained as he cleaned away the blood.  

1366
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:42,320
'What am I supposed to do? I have no 
equipment to perform an operation.'

1367
02:17:42,319 --> 02:17:45,599
'Shut up, shut up, shut up,' Pelagia shouted,  

1368
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:51,040
her heart racing with both fear and 
determination. 'Just shut up and do it.'

1369
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:57,440
Because the doctor was unaware that most of 
the blood and flesh had belonged to the broad  

1370
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:04,080
back of Carlo Guercio, it seemed unbelievable to 
him that Antonio Corelli was as little wounded  

1371
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:10,319
as he was. Once he was cleaned, it was clear 
that the victim had six bullets in his chest,  

1372
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:17,680
one in the stomach, and one through the outer 
flesh in his right arm. But the doctor knew  

1373
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:25,120
too much to be optimistic and it still seemed 
hopeless. Frightened of the task that lay ahead  

1374
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:31,519
of him, he opened a bottle of raki, drank 
deeply and passed the bottle to Velisarios,  

1375
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:37,920
who did the same. Then, with the comforting 
taste of alcohol in his mouth, he reached for  

1376
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:43,920
an instrument and moved it gently around in 
each wound until he felt it reach a bullet.

1377
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:51,359
He stood up amazed, realizing that the holes 
were not even deep and that the bullets should  

1378
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:57,920
have passed right through the victim's body 
but had not done so. 'Daughter,' he said,  

1379
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:06,480
'I swear by all the saints that this man's 
flesh is made of steel. I think he'll live.'

1380
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:16,960
'Antonio,' he called, and Corelli opened his eyes. 
'Antonio, I'm going to operate. I haven't got much  

1381
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:24,000
morphia. Can you drink?' Corelli nodded, and 
Pelagia poured a cup of raki down his throat  

1382
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:30,800
while the doctor injected morphia into his arm. 
Pelagia looked at that desperately damaged body,  

1383
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:36,160
helpless as a worm, and knew that it 
was not exactly a body that one loved,  

1384
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:42,639
but that one loved the man who shone out through 
the eyes and used his mouth to smile and speak.  

1385
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:47,840
The doctor saw her dreaming and 
said, 'Don't just sit there.  

1386
02:19:48,399 --> 02:19:53,120
We need more boiling water. And wash 
your hands, especially under the nails.'

1387
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:59,840
Pelagia discovered in that hour how difficult 
the task was that she had set her father.  

1388
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:06,080
Her hands trembled, and at first she could 
hardly force herself to touch the captain.  

1389
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:11,760
She looked up and saw her father cutting 
wide holes around the bullet wounds  

1390
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:18,720
and had to resist her desire to be sick. The 
doctor started on the bullet in the stomach,  

1391
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:23,360
since he needed to do something that was 
relatively easy in order to increase his  

1392
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:30,960
confidence. He found it not far beneath the 
surface of the skin and picked it out, amazed by  

1393
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:39,120
its flattened shape. 'It's unbelievable,' he said, 
showing it to Pelagia. 'How do you explain this?'

1394
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:47,359
'He was behind that big man, the one as 
big as me,' said Velisarios. 'The big man  

1395
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:54,399
was holding him from behind, like this.' He 
stood up and put his hands behind his back  

1396
02:20:54,399 --> 02:21:01,200
to show how one could grip another's wrists. 'I 
think he was trying to save the man,' he said.

1397
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:06,960
'Carlo,' said Pelagia, 
suddenly bursting into tears.  

1398
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:12,800
Carlo was the first of the boys of La Scala 
whom they now knew with certainty was dead.

1399
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,399
'No man who dies like that has died for 
nothing,' said the doctor, fighting back  

1400
02:21:18,399 --> 02:21:23,839
his own need for tears. Pelagia wiped her 
eyes on the sleeve of her dress and said,  

1401
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:28,080
'Antonio always said that Carlo 
was the bravest in the Army.'

1402
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:32,320
'Velisarios, is the man's body still there?  

1403
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:36,640
We would like to bury it and not 
see it burned,' said the doctor.

1404
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:44,880
'It's after dark, I'll go and look,' said the 
strongman. 'On the way, I might kill a German, who  

1405
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:51,600
knows?' He departed, happy to be out of that house 
where the sights were enough to make one ill.

1406
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:58,399
When the doctor had finished cleaning out the 
wound, he gave Pelagia the task of sewing it up,  

1407
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:04,480
and she did so with accuracy and care, despite 
her feeling of the unreality of it all.  

1408
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:10,240
Velisarios buried Carlo Guercio's remains 
that night in the yard of the doctor's house.  

1409
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:16,719
Just before dawn, when the operation on the 
captain was finished at last, and father and  

1410
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:22,880
daughter were both utterly exhausted, they came 
out to say their goodbye to that heroic soldier.

1411
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:26,960
Pelagia combed the hair and kissed the forehead,  

1412
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:31,201
and Velisarios placed a 
cigarette in the dead man's lips.  

1413
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:40,319
'I owed him one,' he said. The doctor made a 
speech while Pelagia wept beside him. 'Sleep  

1414
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:46,799
long and well,' he ended. 'As long as we remember 
you, you will be remembered fair and young.'

1415
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:52,080
Leaning upon each other, the doctor 
and his daughter returned inside.  

1416
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:59,200
Carefully, they carried Corelli to Pelagia's 
bed, and outside the first birds sang.

1417
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:01,920
***

1418
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:07,760
It was only a short time before the Germans began 
to take an interest in loot. Not only did the  

1419
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:14,400
doctor have to hide his valuables, he also had to 
hide an Italian officer who lay, unable to move,  

1420
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:20,240
in his daughter's bed. Pelagia made a bed for 
him at the bottom of the hole in the kitchen,  

1421
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:24,480
and once again Velisarios 
was called in to carry him.  

1422
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:31,840
There Corelli was reunited with his mandolin 
and Carlo's papers were temporarily removed.  

1423
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:36,399
The lid of the hiding-place was left open 
unless troops were in the neighbourhood.

1424
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:44,880
For the first day after the operation the captain 
slept, but when he first woke, the pain was so bad  

1425
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:49,359
that he could not move at all, and he felt 
as if he had been run over by a lorry.

1426
02:23:50,479 --> 02:23:53,919
'I can't breathe,' he told the doctor.

1427
02:23:54,800 --> 02:24:01,600
'If you couldn't breathe you couldn't speak.' The 
captain said nothing and the doctor continued,  

1428
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:05,120
'It appears that Carlo saved your life.'

1429
02:24:06,319 --> 02:24:09,679
'It doesn't "appear". I know he did.  

1430
02:24:10,399 --> 02:24:15,759
Of all of us, he died the best. 
And he's left me to remember it.'

1431
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:22,880
'You shouldn't weep, Captain. We are going to 
get you well, and then get you off the island.'

1432
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:27,920
'When I am better you must 
move me from the house, Doctor.  

1433
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:34,160
I don't want you in danger. If I 
am caught, I should die alone.'

1434
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:41,840
'We can move you to your secret house, where you 
used to go with Pelagia. Don't look so surprised.  

1435
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:47,120
Everybody knew. And you may 
not get better. Remember that.'

1436
02:24:48,399 --> 02:24:51,519
'My God, Doctor, please tell me some lies.'

1437
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:58,400
'The truth will make us free. We 
overcome fear by looking it in the eyes.'

1438
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:06,639
The captain fell into a fever two days later and 
Pelagia remained in the hiding-place with him,  

1439
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:13,120
wiping his forehead to reduce his temperature. 
The fever came to a crisis on the fourth day,  

1440
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:18,400
and Corelli was sweating so much 
and talking so nonsensically  

1441
02:25:18,399 --> 02:25:25,599
that both the doctor and Pelagia feared for 
his life. But two days later the fever left,  

1442
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:31,440
and the patient opened his eyes with wonder, 
as if realizing that he existed for the first  

1443
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:37,759
time. He felt weaker than it ought to be 
possible to feel, but by the same evening  

1444
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:44,800
he was able to stand with the doctor's help and 
let himself be washed. Pelagia fetched a mirror  

1445
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:51,840
and showed him his new-grown beard, and that 
night he was fed his first solid meal. Snails.

1446
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:53,520
***

1447
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:58,960
In later life, Pelagia remembered the 
time of Corelli's recovery and his escape  

1448
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:06,319
not as a period of exciting adventure, nor even as 
a time of fear and hope, but as the slow beginning  

1449
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:14,799
of her sorrows. The war had reduced her anyway. 
Her skin, stretched tightly over her bones,  

1450
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:21,520
was transparent from lack of food, and when she 
ate she chewed carefully in case she lost a tooth.  

1451
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:28,640
Her rich black hair had thinned and lost 
its shine, and showed the first grey hairs  

1452
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:34,960
that should not have appeared for at least 
another decade. It was hard to obtain food,  

1453
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:41,120
and the doctor was reduced to trapping snakes 
and other such creatures. Things were not  

1454
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:48,240
hopeless, however; there was always the 
sea, the source of Cephallonia's being.

1455
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:53,439
As soon as Corelli could walk, he went in 
the company of the doctor and Velisarios to  

1456
02:26:53,439 --> 02:27:00,080
Casa Nostra at night, while Pelagia remained at 
home in the hiding-place in which the mandolin,  

1457
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:06,960
the doctor's History and Carlo's papers had been 
replaced. As long as the German rapists were on  

1458
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:14,240
the island, she hardly left the house. Corelli 
had given her his ring, too big for any of her  

1459
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:20,800
fingers, and she turned it round and round in 
the lamplight. The captain came frequently,  

1460
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:27,600
after dark, complaining that the hut was cold, his 
new beard scratching her cheeks as they lay fully  

1461
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:33,760
clothed upon her bed, wrapped in each other's 
embrace, talking of the future and the past.

1462
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,840
'I will always hate the Germans,' she said.

1463
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,479
'Gunter saved my life.'

1464
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:43,920
'He murdered all your friends.'

1465
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:45,040
'He had no choice.  

1466
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:50,480
It wouldn't surprise me if he shot himself 
afterwards. He was trying not to cry.'

1467
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:52,880
'There is always a choice.'

1468
02:27:53,760 --> 02:28:00,320
'He wasn't brave like Carlo. Only one in a million 
is made like that, you mustn't blame poor Gunter.'

1469
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:05,040
Pelagia desperately wanted to 
keep her captain on the island,  

1470
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:11,519
but knew that she would kill him if she did. There 
were people who were prepared to betray for bread,  

1471
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:15,281
and it could only be a matter of time 
before the Germans became aware of his  

1472
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:21,840
presence in their lives. She asked Kokolios 
and Stamatis to enquire for news of Bunnios,  

1473
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:25,840
the English spy, and to tell 
him to call on her if he could.

1474
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:31,840
For some time now Bunny Warren had been 
encouraging the owners of boats to help the  

1475
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:37,600
few surviving Italian soldiers to escape from 
the island, and it was easy for him to arrange  

1476
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:44,080
the captain's departure. He called at Pelagia's 
home one night, tapping softly on her window,  

1477
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:50,000
and when she had removed herself from Corelli's 
embrace, she looked out and saw the man whose  

1478
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:56,960
help she had both sought and feared. He came in 
through the door and very formally shook her hand.

1479
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:04,161
'Who is this?' asked Corelli, who for a moment 
had been fearing a visit from the Germans.

1480
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:12,000
'Bunnios,' said Pelagia, without answering his 
question, 'this is an Italian soldier and we have  

1481
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:18,319
to get him out.' By chance a boat was leaving 
for Sicily the following morning and it would  

1482
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:24,160
be easy to put the captain on board. They simply 
had to go to a certain bay at one o'clock in the  

1483
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:29,439
morning with a lamp, and flash out to sea in 
answer to the signals flashed from the boat.

1484
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:34,080
Corelli did not go back to 
Casa Nostra before dawn,  

1485
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:39,359
but stayed with Pelagia in the house. The 
three of them sat in that familiar kitchen,  

1486
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:45,679
saddened and fearful, talking quietly and 
shaking their heads over all the memories.

1487
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:49,840
'I owe my life to you, Doctor,' the captain said.

1488
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:54,080
'I am sorry about the scars. 
It was the best I could do.'

1489
02:29:55,359 --> 02:30:01,519
'And I am sorry, Doctor, about the rape of the 
island. I don't suppose we will ever be forgiven.'

1490
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:05,919
'As you know, Captain, I 
must have forgiven you, or  

1491
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:09,280
I would not have given you 
permission to marry my daughter.'

1492
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:17,599
Pelagia and Corelli looked at each other and the 
captain said, 'We have decided that if we have  

1493
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:25,201
a son, we will name him Iannis.' The doctor 
was visibly delighted, even though this was  

1494
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:32,160
exactly what he would have expected under the 
circumstances. He looked up, his eyes watering,  

1495
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:40,319
and said simply, 'Antonio, if I have ever had a 
son it was you. You have a place at this table.'

1496
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:46,480
Corelli stood up and the two men 
embraced, clapping each other on the back,  

1497
02:30:46,479 --> 02:30:48,559
and then the doctor embraced his daughter.  

1498
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:56,080
'I'll leave you two children together,' he said. 
'There is a little girl dying and I should visit.'

1499
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:02,240
The doctor left the house and the 
two lovers sat opposite each other,  

1500
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:08,319
unable to speak. Finally the tears began to 
follow each other slowly down Pelagia's cheeks,  

1501
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:14,720
and Corelli knelt beside her, put his arms 
around her and laid his head against her chest.  

1502
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:20,559
He was shocked again at how thin 
she was and closed his eyes tightly,  

1503
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:28,240
imagining that it was another world. 'I am so 
afraid,' she said. 'I think you won't come back,  

1504
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:34,960
and the war goes on and on forever, and there's no 
safety and no hope and I'll be left with nothing.'

1505
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:42,080
'I shall not forget you and I 
will come back,' replied Corelli.

1506
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:42,559
'Promise?'

1507
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:47,359
'I promise. I have left you my ring and Antonia.'

1508
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:50,080
'We never read Carlo's papers.'

1509
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:54,240
'Too painful. We'll read them when I return.'

1510
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:58,080
She stroked his hair in silence and said finally,  

1511
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:05,280
'Antonio, I wish that we had... 
lain together. As a man and woman.'

1512
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:09,840
'Everything at the right time, koritsimou.'

1513
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,080
'There may not be a time.'

1514
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,200
'There will be. You have my promise.'

1515
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:23,040
At eleven o'clock Bunny Warren scratched at 
the window. He carried a knife in his belt  

1516
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:27,760
and sounded extremely efficient as he 
gave detailed instructions to the doctor,  

1517
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:29,920
who translated them for Corelli's benefit.

1518
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,399
It was a cold December night, there 
was no moon, and since most Germans  

1519
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:41,040
preferred to be indoors on such a night, the 
journey to the beach was relatively safe.  

1520
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:50,319
Nevertheless, Pelagia's heart beat fast and a dark 
hole seemed to be opening in her heart. Corelli  

1521
02:32:50,319 --> 02:32:55,840
felt so sad he almost wished that they would 
meet some German soldiers so that he could die,  

1522
02:32:56,399 --> 02:33:03,120
fighting and killing, and end it all. He knew that 
to leave the island would be to lose his roots.

1523
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:10,559
For warmth, the four of them stood close together 
on the tiny patch of sand, waiting for the flash  

1524
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:16,161
of a lamp that would come to them from the 
sea. Corelli walked to the waterline and,  

1525
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:20,240
seeing the black waves, wondered how 
he would ever survive the journey.  

1526
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:25,920
He felt his love for the island turning 
in his chest like the twist of a knife,  

1527
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:31,281
because he had his own village now and 
even his thought and speech had changed.  

1528
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:37,840
Returning to Pelagia, he held her face 
in his hands and then embraced her.

1529
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:44,080
When the light flashed three times from 
the sea and Warren returned the signal,  

1530
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:51,040
Corelli shook his hand, kissed his father-in-law 
on both cheeks and went to Pelagia once more.  

1531
02:33:52,240 --> 02:33:57,599
There was nothing to be said. He knew 
that her mouth was trembling with grief  

1532
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:04,880
and his throat was tight with the same emotion. 
He stroked her cheek tenderly and kissed her eyes.  

1533
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:10,559
He heard the sound of the boat approaching 
and looked up to see the shadows of two men  

1534
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:17,760
inside it. The four approached the boat and the 
doctor said, 'Go well, Antonio, and return.'

1535
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:24,719
'May God hear you,' said the captain, 
and for the last time he held Pelagia.

1536
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:30,800
After he had climbed into the boat, 
disappearing into the darkness like a ghost,  

1537
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:37,360
Pelagia ran into the waves until the sea reached 
her thighs, but though she tried to catch sight of  

1538
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:45,759
him, she saw nothing. A terrible emptiness seized 
her and she put her hands to her face and wept,  

1539
02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:52,479
bent over in pain, her cries carried off in the 
wind and were lost in the sound of the sea.

02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:56,720
CHAPTER TWELVE

1541
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:02,080
1943-9: The Years of Terror

1542
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:07,040
Of the German occupation there is little to say,  

1543
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:13,040
except that it caused the islanders to feel more 
appreciation for the Italians they had lost.  

1544
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:18,399
It seldom happens that a people can learn 
to feel friendly towards their oppressors,  

1545
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:23,840
but hardly since Roman times had there 
been any other kind of rule in Cephallonia.  

1546
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:30,240
Now there were no more Italians working in the 
fields beside the farmers in order to escape the  

1547
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:36,559
boredom of army life, there were no more football 
matches between teams that quarrelled and cheated,  

1548
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:42,000
there were no flirtations with girls by 
soldiers who had a cigarette hanging from  

1549
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:48,000
the corners of their mouths. There were no 
more voices sending out opera tunes across  

1550
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:54,000
the pine trees of the mountains. Gone were 
the charming chicken-thieves, and in their  

1551
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:00,479
place came a period of time that the doctor 
recorded in his History as the worst time of all.

1552
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:08,399
The islanders remember that the Germans were 
not human beings. They were machines without  

1553
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:16,000
principles, machines that only knew how to loot 
and kill, without any passion except the love of  

1554
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:22,240
strength, and without belief except in their 
natural right to destroy an inferior race.

1555
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:30,320
The Italians had of course been thieves, but their 
shame when caught showed that they recognized  

1556
02:36:30,319 --> 02:36:36,639
their guilt. The Germans came into the house 
at any time of day, kicked over the furniture,  

1557
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:43,439
beat the occupants, however old or young, and 
in front of their eyes carried away whatever  

1558
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:49,280
they liked. Both Pelagia and her father were 
beaten at different times for no apparent  

1559
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:56,960
cause. Drosoula had cigarettes burned into her 
skin for frowning at an officer. The doctor had  

1560
02:36:56,960 --> 02:37:02,720
all his precious medical equipment, gathered 
together over twenty years of poverty, broken  

1561
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:08,800
in his presence by four officers whose hearts 
were as dark and empty as the caves of hell.

1562
02:37:10,319 --> 02:37:14,880
When in November 1944 the German 
troops were ordered to withdraw,  

1563
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:18,560
they destroyed every building 
for which they found the time,  

1564
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:24,479
and the inhabitants of Cephallonia rose up against 
them and fought them all the way to the sea.

1565
02:37:26,479 --> 02:37:32,639
But the night before he left, Gunter Weber, who 
had ashamedly stayed away from the house since the  

1566
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:38,720
time of the killings, brought his record player 
and his collection of Marlene Dietrich records  

1567
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:43,440
and left them outside Pelagia's door, 
as he had promised in happier days.  

1568
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:50,241
He wrote a note in Italian: 'God be 
with you, I will remember you always.'

1569
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:58,880
Pelagia hid the record player in the hole in the 
floor, with Antonio's mandolin and Carlo's papers,  

1570
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:02,241
and it survived the terrible years that followed.

1571
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:04,880
***

1572
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:11,600
The Germans left and the celebrations began, 
but no sooner had the bells begun ringing than  

1573
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:18,640
the members of the Communist organization ELAS, 
now calling themselves EAM, came out from hiding  

1574
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:25,040
and attempted to take control of the country. 
They formed Workers' Councils and elected  

1575
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:31,280
themselves to every post of authority. In 
Cephallonia the Communists began to send  

1576
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:37,679
awkward characters to prison camps. On the 
mainland they poisoned, with dead animals,  

1577
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:44,720
the water of villages that opposed them. Into 
mass graves they threw the dead bodies of Greeks  

1578
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:49,680
who had had their eyes torn out and their 
mouths cut into the shape of a smile.  

1579
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:57,600
They kidnapped 30,000 little children and sent 
them across the border into Communist Yugoslavia  

1580
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:03,680
to be taught how to be true Communists. 
ELAS soldiers captured by the British were  

1581
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:09,840
so frightened of their leaders that they begged 
to be allowed to remain in British prison camps.

1582
02:39:10,399 --> 02:39:16,240
Pelagia and the doctor were two out of millions 
of people whose lives were forever destroyed  

1583
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:22,399
by these butchers. The doctor was dragged away 
in the night by three men who had decided that  

1584
02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:29,759
since he was a doctor he must be a Fascist. 
They threw Pelagia into a corner and beat  

1585
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:35,600
her unconscious with a chair. When Kokolios 
came out from his house to defend the doctor,  

1586
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:42,400
he too was carried away, even though he was 
a Communist. He was accompanied by Stamatis,  

1587
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:47,759
a supporter of the royal family, and the three 
men were taken to the harbour for transportation.

1588
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:51,839
Pelagia did not know what 
had happened to her father,  

1589
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:58,559
and none of the authorities would tell her. 
Alone in the house, penniless and helpless,  

1590
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:05,040
for the first time in her life she thought 
of ending everything by killing herself. The  

1591
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:13,040
island seemed to be cursed by an endless series of 
oppressors. When would Antonio return? The war was  

1592
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:19,920
continuing in Europe, and probably he was dead. 
She heard that the Communists had been killing the  

1593
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:25,760
Italian soldiers who had come to fight alongside 
them against the Greeks. Had the time come,  

1594
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:31,600
finally, to hate the Greeks? Of the nations 
who had broken into her house to beat her  

1595
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:35,840
and steal her possessions, only the 
Italians were innocent, it seemed.

1596
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:44,479
Fortunately she had a friend. Drosoula had long 
known that Pelagia had lost her love for Mandras,  

1597
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:51,439
and that by his long silence he had given up his 
rights. She knew also that Pelagia was waiting  

1598
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:59,839
for an Italian, but she felt no bitterness and 
never uttered a single word of blame. When Pelagia  

1599
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:06,319
stumbled bleeding through her door after the 
Communists had taken Dr Iannis, Drosoula, who had  

1600
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:12,880
also suffered much, stroked her hair and uttered 
loving words, as if Pelagia were her own daughter.  

1601
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:19,920
Within a week she had closed up her little house 
on the harbour and moved into the doctor's house  

1602
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:26,960
on the hill. She found his Italian gun in a 
drawer and kept it at her side in case of attack.

1603
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:34,720
Like Pelagia, Drosoula had been reduced by 
the war. The layers of fat had melted from  

1604
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:42,640
her waist and thighs, and her great ugly moon 
of a face had sunk inwards. However, her tall,  

1605
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:49,840
thin form and grey hairs demanded respect, 
and her unbroken spirit gave Pelagia strength.

1606
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:57,200
For comfort they slept together in the doctor's 
bed, and by day they made plans to find supplies  

1607
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:03,840
of food and listened to each others complaints and 
stories. They dug for roots in the undergrowth,  

1608
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:07,600
and Drosoula took her young friend 
down to the harbour to learn to fish.

1609
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:16,960
But Drosoula was out when Mandras returned, full 
of selfimportance and new ideas, expecting the  

1610
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:22,880
admiring attention of the young woman he had 
not seen for years, and determined to take  

1611
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:29,040
revenge. He came in through the door without 
knocking and leaned his gun against the wall.  

1612
02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:34,719
When she heard the noise in the kitchen, 
Pelagia, who was in her room, called out,  

1613
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:42,080
'Drosoula?' A man came in who she did not 
recognize, except that he looked very like  

1614
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:48,240
Drosoula had done before the war; there 
was the same swollen stomach and thighs,  

1615
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:54,080
the same round, coarse face and thickened 
lips. Puzzled, Pelagia stood up.

1616
02:42:55,200 --> 02:43:02,000
Mandras also was confused. There was something 
about this desperately thin, frightened girl  

1617
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:08,720
that reminded him of Pelagia, but this woman 
had silver threads in her thin black hair, her  

1618
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:14,880
blouse and skirt hung straight to the ground, her 
cheeks were hollow. He looked quickly around the  

1619
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:21,160
room to see whether Pelagia was there, assuming 
that this must be a cousin or an aunt. 'Mandras,  

1620
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:27,279
is it you?' said the woman, 
and he recognized the voice.

1621
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:34,639
He stood, amazed and confused, with 
much of his hatred knocked out of him,  

1622
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:39,680
while she looked at those coarse and 
altered features and felt deep disgust.  

1623
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:45,519
'I thought you must be dead,' she said finally.

1624
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:56,160
He closed the door and leaned against it. 'You 
mean you were hoping I was dead. As you see,  

1625
02:43:56,160 --> 02:44:04,080
I am not. I am very much alive and well. 
Don't I get a kiss from my fiancee?'

1626
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:08,399
She advanced fearfully and 
placed a kiss on his right cheek.

1627
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:12,960
'I am glad you are alive,' she said.

1628
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:16,560
He caught both her wrists and held them tightly.  

1629
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:22,720
'I don't think you are. How is your 
father, by the way? Is he not here?'

1630
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:32,080
'Let me go,' she said softly, and he did so. 
'The Communists took him away' she told him.

1631
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:36,319
'Well, he must have done something to deserve it.'

1632
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:43,600
'He did nothing. He healed the sick. And they 
beat me with a chair and took everything.'

1633
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:50,480
'There must be reasons. The party is never 
wrong. Whoever is not with us is against us.'

1634
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:56,160
She noticed that he wore the red star 
of ELAS sewn into the front of his cap.  

1635
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:59,840
'You're one of them,' she said.

1636
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:04,161
He leaned against the door, 
placing all his weight against it,  

1637
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:06,960
increasing her sense of imprisonment and her fear.  

1638
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:16,240
'Not just one of them, an important one of them,' 
he stated, sounding pleased with himself, then  

1639
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:23,040
added challengingly, 'Soon we will have a nice 
big house to live in. When shall we get married?'

1640
02:45:24,479 --> 02:45:27,839
She trembled and, seeing 
this, his anger increased.  

1641
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:35,519
'We will not be married,' she said. 'We were 
very young, it was not what we thought it was.'

1642
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:43,040
'Not what we thought? And there was I, fighting 
for Greece, thinking of you all day and dreaming  

1643
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:48,640
of you at night. And now I come back at last 
and find a faded cow who has forgotten me.'

1644
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:51,760
'What's the matter with you?' she asked.

1645
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:57,120
'The matter with me?' He took from 
his pocket a thick bundle of papers.  

1646
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:04,399
'This is what is the matter with me.' He threw 
them towards her feet and she picked them up  

1647
02:46:04,399 --> 02:46:10,479
slowly. She held the bundle in her hands 
and realized that it consisted of her  

1648
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:17,200
letters to him in Albania. 'My letters?' 
she said, turning them over in her hands.

1649
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:24,880
Mandras gave a sudden roar of disgust and, 
seizing the letters, he found the last one,  

1650
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:32,480
held it up to the light and read, 'You never 
write to me, and at first I was sad and worried.  

1651
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:37,840
Now I realize that you cannot care and this 
has caused me to lose my love for you also.  

1652
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:44,400
I want you to know that I have decided to 
release you from your promises. I am sorry,'

1653
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:52,720
He gave a smile that was both humourless 
and threatening. 'Yes, I'm able to read now,  

1654
02:46:53,359 --> 02:46:56,719
and this is what I found in the letters 
I had been carrying next to my heart.  

1655
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:02,960
And now I know the truth. Do you know the 
first thing I heard when I arrived back here?  

1656
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:11,360
I heard, "Mandras, did you hear about your old 
fiancee? She's going to marry an Italian." So  

1657
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:17,120
you've found a Fascist for yourself, have you? 
Is this what I've been fighting for, you cow?'

1658
02:47:18,479 --> 02:47:23,439
Pelagia stood up, her lips trembling, 
and said, 'Mandras, let me out.'

1659
02:47:24,399 --> 02:47:29,439
'Let me out,' he repeated, 'let me out. 
Poor little thing's frightened, is she?'  

1660
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:35,519
He came up to her and struck her across the 
face so hard that she spun round before she  

1661
02:47:35,520 --> 02:47:41,680
fell. He kicked her in the stomach and bent down 
to pick her up by the wrists, then he threw her  

1662
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:47,840
on the bed and, quite against his original 
intentions, began to tear at her clothes.

1663
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:54,240
This rape of women was something that he could 
not help, it seemed. It was a feeling that came  

1664
02:47:54,240 --> 02:48:00,319
from deep inside him, something he had learned 
in years of not needing to explain his actions to  

1665
02:48:00,319 --> 02:48:08,000
anyone. It was his natural right, and the violence 
was much more exciting than the sexual act itself.

1666
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:16,800
But Pelagia fought. Her nails broke in his flesh, 
she struck him with hands and knees and elbows,  

1667
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:23,520
she screamed and struggled. To Mandras her 
resistance was unreasonable, he was failing  

1668
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:30,400
despite his weight and strength, and he sat back 
and hit her repeatedly. Then suddenly he tried to  

1669
02:48:30,399 --> 02:48:36,960
pull up her skirts. The solid weight of her gun 
fell out of its pocket and landed beside her head  

1670
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:42,800
on the pillow, but Mandras did not see it, and 
when the bullet cracked through his shoulder,  

1671
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:48,400
the shock knocked him backwards and he 
gazed at Pelagia in shock and accusation.

1672
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:54,400
Drosoula heard the crack of the gunshot 
just as she came through the kitchen door  

1673
02:48:54,399 --> 02:49:00,319
and at first she did not recognize the sound, 
but then she knew what it was and took the  

1674
02:49:00,319 --> 02:49:06,160
Italian gun from the drawer. Without thinking, 
knowing that thought would make her a coward,  

1675
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:11,840
she pushed open the door of Pelagia's 
room and saw there the unthinkable.

1676
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:17,760
She had thought that Pelagia might have 
shot herself, that there might be thieves,  

1677
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:23,360
but when she burst in, she saw the doctor's 
daughter leaning up on her elbow, her face  

1678
02:49:23,359 --> 02:49:31,519
swollen and bloody, her lips split, her clothes 
torn. Drosoula followed Pelagia's gaze and saw,  

1679
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:38,640
leaning against the wall behind the door, a man 
who might have been her son. She ran to Pelagia's  

1680
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:47,840
side and took her into her arms, rocking her, and 
heard the words, 'He... tried ... to... rape me.'

1681
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:56,479
Drosoula stood up, and mother and son examined 
each other in disbelief. So much had changed.  

1682
02:49:57,279 --> 02:50:04,319
As the anger grew in the woman, the fire in 
Mandras died. A wave of self-pity overcame him  

1683
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:12,080
and all he wanted to do was weep; everything 
had come to nothing, everything was lost.  

1684
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:20,559
The horror of the war in Albania, the years in the 
forest, his new power and importance, it was all  

1685
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:27,121
a dream, and he was a frightened little boy 
again, trembling before the anger of his mother.  

1686
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,160
And his shoulder hurt so much.  

1687
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:36,479
He wanted to show it to her, to win her 
attention. He wanted her to touch and heal it.

1688
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:44,480
But she pointed the gun at him and spat the one 
word that seemed to mean the most, 'Fascist'.

1689
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:49,840
'Mother...' he said in a voice 
that was low and frightened.

1690
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:57,120
'How dare you call me "mother"? I 
am no mother and you are not my son.  

1691
02:50:57,920 --> 02:51:04,960
I have a daughter...' she pointed to Pelagia, who 
had curled into a ball, '... and this is what you  

1692
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:12,720
do. I do not know you, never in my life do I want 
to see you again, I have forgotten you, my curse  

1693
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:20,160
goes with you. May you never know peace, may your 
heart burst in your chest, may you die alone,'  

1694
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:28,000
She spat on the ground and shook her head with 
disgust. 'Pig rapist, get out before I kill you.'

1695
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:35,120
Mandras left his gun leaning against the wall 
of the kitchen, and with bright red blood on  

1696
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:40,720
his right hand where he still held his wound, 
he stumbled out into the cold December sun.  

1697
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:46,319
He looked through tearful eyes at the 
tree where once he had swung and laughed,  

1698
02:51:46,319 --> 02:51:52,559
and where, he seemed to remember, there 
had once been a goat. It was a tree that  

1699
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:58,640
was incomplete without Pelagia as she was, 
fresh and beautiful, slicing onions beneath it  

1700
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:05,760
and smiling through the tears. A wave of grief 
overcame him and his throat tightened with sorrow.

1701
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:12,560
It did not occur to him that he was just 
one more life twisted and ruined by the war.  

1702
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:20,161
He was aware only that heaven had disappeared, 
that hope had turned to dust, that joy,  

1703
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:25,680
which had once shone brighter than the summer 
sun, had disappeared into the black light  

1704
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:33,920
and cold heat of mass murder. He had struggled 
for a better world and instead had destroyed it.

1705
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:42,640
There was once a place where all had shone with 
delight and innocence. He stood still for a  

1706
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:50,720
moment, recalling where it was; then he went down 
to the sea, stood on the waterline, and kicked off  

1707
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:57,040
his boots. With his right hand he slowly removed 
his clothes till he stood with nothing on.  

1708
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:04,560
He realized he wanted only to feel the sea and 
sand upon his skin. He needed to be washed.

1709
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:12,720
He remembered days in his boat with nothing to do 
except fish; he remembered his joy when something  

1710
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:20,000
fine was landed for Pelagia, his pleasure at her 
pleasure when he gave it to her. He remembered  

1711
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:26,080
that in those days he was beautiful. He began 
walking into the sea that would take his life,  

1712
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:37,920
and by drowning him make him clean, 
make him pure and innocent once more.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1714
02:53:39,760 --> 02:53:40,560
Antonia

1715
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:48,960
There had been so many rapes that Pelagia and 
Drosoula were not surprised to find an abandoned  

1716
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:54,560
bundle on their doorstep. It had been born at 
a time when its father could have been a German  

1717
02:53:54,560 --> 02:54:01,121
or a Communist, and the mother might have 
been any unfortunate girl at all. Whoever this  

1718
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:05,760
sorrowing and dishonoured girl had been, 
she had cared enough about her child  

1719
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:10,080
to leave it upon the doorstep of a 
doctors house, knowing that those inside  

1720
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:16,160
would be able to cope. The disorder of the 
times was so great that the two women could  

1721
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:22,479
think of no solution except to try and care 
for it themselves, thinking that in time  

1722
02:54:22,479 --> 02:54:28,080
the child could be adopted by someone childless 
or handed to a charitable organization.

1723
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:36,800
They had taken the child inside and unwrapped 
it and discovered that it was a girl. She was  

1724
02:54:36,800 --> 02:54:44,160
very calm and cried only a little. She sucked the 
thumb of her right hand (a habit she never lost,  

1725
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:51,040
even in old age), and she smiled a lot, her 
legs and arms waving up and down in delight.

1726
02:54:52,479 --> 02:54:58,719
The two women, who had suffered so greatly from 
loss and unhappiness, found that the child,  

1727
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:06,480
whom they named Antonia, gave new meaning to their 
lives. Because of her, the women's tragic memories  

1728
02:55:06,479 --> 02:55:12,479
began to fade, and she took her place in their 
lives as if she had always been meant to be there.  

1729
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:19,040
In all her life, Antonia never asked 
a question about her father, and only  

1730
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:25,200
when she applied for a passport to go abroad did 
she discover that she did not officially exist.

1731
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:33,200
She did have a grandfather, however. When Dr 
Iannis returned after two years, stumbling  

1732
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:40,000
into the kitchen supported by two charity workers, 
utterly broken by his treatment in the prison camp  

1733
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:46,160
and forever speechless, he bent down and 
kissed the child before retiring to his room.  

1734
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:56,000
Just as Antonia did not enquire about a father, 
Dr Iannis did not enquire about the child. It  

1735
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:01,760
was enough for him to know that the world had gone 
down a path that he had no hope of understanding.  

1736
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:07,200
He accepted that his daughter and 
Drosoula would sleep in his bed,  

1737
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:12,479
and that he would take Pelagia's, because, 
whichever bed it was, he would dream the  

1738
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:18,719
same dreams of a forced march of hundreds of 
kilometres without his boots, without food  

1739
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:25,520
or water. He would hear the cries of villagers 
as their houses burned, the crack of gunshots  

1740
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:32,880
as they were murdered, and he would witness, 
over and over again, Stamatis and Kokolios dying  

1741
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:39,840
in each other's arms and begging him to leave 
them in the road in case he himself was shot.

1742
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:46,640
In his wordlessness, Dr Iannis drew the same 
comfort from Antonia that he had drawn from  

1743
02:56:46,640 --> 02:56:52,800
his daughter after his own young wife had 
died. He would put the child upon his knee,  

1744
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:59,040
arranging her black hair, gazing into her brown 
eyes as if this alone was the way to speak,  

1745
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:06,080
her smile filling his heart with sorrow, because 
when she was old she would lose her innocence,  

1746
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:11,920
and learn that tragedy destroys the muscles 
of the face until a smile becomes impossible.

1747
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:21,279
In 1949 the national government succeeded at 
last in defeating the Communists, who lost their  

1748
02:57:21,279 --> 02:57:27,920
control of the country. Dr Iannis took up medicine 
again, helping his daughter in a reversal of their  

1749
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:34,480
roles. It upset Pelagia to see the shaking of 
his hands as he dealt with patients' wounds,  

1750
02:57:34,479 --> 02:57:40,719
and she knew also that he worked despite a 
terrible sense of uselessness. Why preserve  

1751
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:47,600
life when all of us must die, when health is only 
an accident of youth? She wondered sometimes at  

1752
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:54,560
the strength of his desire to heal, despite all he 
had suffered. In the evening she wrapped her arms  

1753
02:57:54,560 --> 02:58:01,840
around him and held him as his mind wandered back 
over the past, his eyes wet with sadness, and she  

1754
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:08,400
buried her head on his chest, understanding that 
by comforting him she was comforting herself too.

1755
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:15,439
She attempted to interest him in working on his 
History, and when she took the papers from the  

1756
02:58:15,439 --> 02:58:20,559
hiding-hole and arranged them in front of him 
at his table, he seemed willing enough to work.  

1757
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:26,161
He read through them, but at the 
end of a week Pelagia found he had  

1758
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:32,319
added only one short paragraph in a shaky 
handwriting that did not look like his old,  

1759
02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:38,880
firm handwriting at all. Then she saw that 
across the bottom of the last page her father  

1760
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:47,120
had written, 'In the past the horrors came from 
outside. Now we have only ourselves to blame.'

1761
02:58:49,279 --> 02:58:54,559
While she had been in the hiding-hole, 
Pelagia had rediscovered Antonio's mandolin  

1762
02:58:54,560 --> 02:59:01,360
and Carlo's papers. She read through the latter 
in a single evening and was astonished; she had  

1763
02:59:01,359 --> 02:59:08,319
never imagined that that powerful, good-natured 
man had suffered so greatly from a secret sadness  

1764
02:59:08,319 --> 02:59:15,120
that had made him a stranger to himself. She saw 
that he had been as determined to lose his life  

1765
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:21,359
as he had been to save Corelli's and she realized 
that if her own adopted child was at risk,  

1766
02:59:21,359 --> 02:59:24,799
she would find the same 
extraordinary courage in herself.

1767
02:59:26,479 --> 02:59:32,719
Antonia grew tall and lovely, a child whose 
movements were filled with confidence and grace.  

1768
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:40,080
She was incapable of behaving like a 'lady', 
and when she sat in her grandfather's armchair  

1769
02:59:40,080 --> 02:59:45,279
she not only sucked her thumb but also 
hung one leg over the arm of the chair,  

1770
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:51,920
ignoring her mother's and Drosoula's protests with 
laughing cries of, 'Don't be so old-fashioned.'

1771
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:59,040
The family were regarded as eccentric. The 
empty-headed gossips of the village regarded  

1772
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:05,279
Drosoula, with her extreme ugliness, and Pelagia, 
with her assumption that she was any man's equal,  

1773
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:10,559
as a pair of crazy women. Children 
threw stones at them as they passed,  

1774
03:00:10,560 --> 03:00:17,201
and adults warned their children to keep away and 
encouraged their dogs to bite them. Nevertheless,  

1775
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:20,639
Pelagia earned a living, because after darkness  

1776
03:00:20,640 --> 03:00:25,280
people would arrive secretly in the belief 
that her treatments were sure to work.

1777
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:34,399
During all this time Pelagia became certain that 
Antonio Corelli was dead and, like her father,  

1778
03:00:34,399 --> 03:00:38,799
she also became certain beyond 
doubt of the reality of ghosts.

1779
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:47,200
It had happened first in 1946 when, one day in 
October, she was standing outside the house with  

1780
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:53,760
the infant Antonia in her arms. She was making 
baby noises and giving the baby her finger to  

1781
03:00:53,760 --> 03:01:00,640
suck, when something made her look up. She saw 
a figure dressed in black, standing before her  

1782
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:07,840
in exactly the same place that Mandras had been 
when he had been shot by Velisarios' cannon. The  

1783
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:14,960
figure was looking at her, as if it wanted to take 
a step towards her, and her heart leapt. There was  

1784
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:21,520
an atmosphere around him of nine thousand weeping 
ghosts, and sorrow seemed to pour from his face.  

1785
03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:30,640
Thin and bearded though he was, she was 
sure it was him. Excited beyond all joy,  

1786
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:36,400
she put the baby down in order to run to 
him, but when she looked up he had gone.

1787
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:44,000
Her heart jumping in her chest, she ran. Around 
the bend she stopped and looked wildly around,  

1788
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:52,640
crying out, 'Antonio! Antonio!' But no voice 
responded and no man came towards her. He had  

1789
03:01:52,640 --> 03:01:58,960
disappeared. Her hands rose to the sky in 
confusion and fell down again to her sides.  

1790
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:05,279
She stood watching and calling until her shouts 
hurt her throat and tears blinded her eyes.

1791
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:13,279
The same ghost appeared at the same place in 
1947 and every year after that at roughly the  

1792
03:02:13,279 --> 03:02:20,479
same time, but never exactly. It was because 
of this that Pelagia came to the conclusion  

1793
03:02:20,479 --> 03:02:26,879
that Antonio had kept his promise to return and 
that it was possible to keep such a promise and  

1794
03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:33,920
continue to love even from beyond the grave. She 
was able to live satisfied, knowing that she had  

1795
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:40,480
not been abandoned, and, filled with happy dreams 
of being desired and loved, she looked forward to  

1796
03:02:40,479 --> 03:02:45,200
her own death when she would once again have 
all that had been stolen away in life.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1798
03:02:51,359 --> 03:02:54,160
1953: Earthquake

1799
03:02:55,920 --> 03:03:02,160
The thirteenth of August, 1953 was a fine 
day, with small white clouds scattered  

1800
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:09,920
here and there most charmingly in the deep blue 
sky. That morning Antonia, now eight years old  

1801
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:16,000
but as tall as a child of twelve, went to pick 
up a sheet of paper from the floor, and when the  

1802
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:23,359
sheet flew upwards and stuck to her hand, she 
cried, 'It's magic,' and ran excitedly outside.

1803
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:28,080
Strange things were happening 
all over the Ionian islands.  

1804
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:33,120
There were no birds in the sky; on 
the hillsides and in the undergrowth,  

1805
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:39,840
snakes and rats left their holes, and in 
the villages all the dogs began barking.

1806
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:48,800
Drosoula came inside sweating and shaking and told 
Pelagia, 'I am ill, I feel terrible, something has  

1807
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:55,920
happened to my heart.' She sat down heavily with 
her hand to her chest, taking deep breaths, and  

1808
03:03:55,920 --> 03:04:02,800
Pelagia went to her medicine cupboard and made a 
drink for her. Antonia, who had come back inside,  

1809
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:08,960
suddenly burst into tears, exclaimed, 'Mama, 
I've got to get out,' and ran outdoors.

1810
03:04:10,399 --> 03:04:17,279
Drosoula and Pelagia were exchanging surprised 
glances when suddenly there came a low, terrible  

1811
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:22,719
roar from the earth that made the two women feel 
as if their hearts were exploding in their chests.  

1812
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:28,080
'A heart attack,' thought Pelagia 
desperately, and she saw Drosoula,  

1813
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:33,680
with her hands on her stomach and her eyes 
staring, stumble as if someone had struck her.

1814
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:40,000
It seemed that time had stopped and 
the indescribable roaring of the earth  

1815
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:47,040
would never end. Dr Iannis rushed out of the room 
that used to be Pelagia's and spoke for the first  

1816
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:57,200
time in years. 'Get out! Get out!' he cried. 
'It's an earthquake! Save yourselves!' His voice  

1817
03:04:57,200 --> 03:05:03,840
sounded small and far away, and immediately 
afterwards he was thrown violently sideways.

1818
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:10,560
More frightened than they had ever been in their 
lives, the two women stumbled towards the door,  

1819
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:16,161
were thrown down and attempted to crawl. But 
again and again they were thrown upwards and  

1820
03:05:16,160 --> 03:05:22,319
sideways and, unable to crawl on their hands 
and knees, they spread their hands and legs  

1821
03:05:22,319 --> 03:05:28,319
and moved towards the door like snakes, 
reaching it just as the roof began to fall in.

1822
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:35,120
Outside in the yard dust was slowly 
rising as the earth went up and down,  

1823
03:05:35,680 --> 03:05:41,201
while in the centre of the street a stream of 
water suddenly rose to a height of twelve metres  

1824
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:49,520
and then disappeared as if it had never been. 
Houses suddenly leapt upwards and solid stone  

1825
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:56,161
walls moved like paper in the wind, and then 
suddenly there was a stillness like that of death.

1826
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:05,359
Pelagia, spitting and covered in dirt, filled with 
a sense of utter helplessness, began to struggle  

1827
03:06:05,359 --> 03:06:12,160
to her knees. Suddenly the strange silence 
was broken by the wild cries of the priest,  

1828
03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:19,040
who rushed from the church with his arms 
raised to heaven. 'You pig!' he roared. 'You  

1829
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:27,840
evil dog!' He fell to his knees and, with tears 
in his eyes, struck at the earth with his fists.

1830
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:35,920
At this point, as if in response to his cries, 
the terrible roaring began again and once more  

1831
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:42,000
the Cephallonian earth danced, the peaks 
of the mountains rocking like boats.  

1832
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:48,800
During those intervals when the motion stopped, 
Pelagia, Drosoula and Antonia held tightly on to  

1833
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:53,360
each other, gazing in horror at the old 
house, of which there was little left.  

1834
03:06:54,240 --> 03:06:59,279
The walls were reduced to half their height 
and the roof lay in ruins on the floor.  

1835
03:07:00,319 --> 03:07:06,160
This ruin contained the sad soul and tired 
old body of the doctor, who had planned his  

1836
03:07:06,160 --> 03:07:12,000
last words for years and now died beneath 
the stones without the chance to say them.

1837
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:14,800
***

1838
03:07:14,800 --> 03:07:21,600
The British were the first to arrive, sending 
four large ships carrying water, food, medicines,  

1839
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:28,560
doctors and rescue equipment. Italy, remembering 
its shameful past, sent ships loaded with rescue  

1840
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:34,880
workers, and American ships arrived carrying 
earthmovers, helicopters and 3,000 sailors.  

1841
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:42,160
The Greek Navy turned up late but eager, and the 
King of Greece and his family travelled around the  

1842
03:07:42,160 --> 03:07:48,240
islands. The earthmovers began the slow work 
of clearing the ruined houses, and foreign  

1843
03:07:48,240 --> 03:07:54,479
aid workers built cities of tents as temporary 
accommodation for the islanders. Aeroplanes and  

1844
03:07:54,479 --> 03:08:00,240
helicopters dropped food to hillside communities 
whose roads had been cut off by the earthquake.

1845
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:05,360
In Cephallonia, because of the 
wide streets and the fact that  

1846
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:10,799
most buildings were only one storey high, 
few people actually died in the earthquake.  

1847
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:16,560
There were the usual stories concerning people 
who had lost their sense of time and appeared  

1848
03:08:16,560 --> 03:08:21,440
from beneath the ruins of houses after nine 
days, believing it had been a few hours.

1849
03:08:22,479 --> 03:08:27,599
The islanders reacted differently, according to 
whether or not they found a natural leader among  

1850
03:08:27,600 --> 03:08:35,280
themselves. Where none appeared, people became sad 
and purposeless and had terrible dreams of falling  

1851
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:41,920
into endless space. During the earthquake 
itself perhaps a quarter of the islanders,  

1852
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:47,440
like the doctor, had remained calm, but 
afterwards the remaining three-quarters  

1853
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:53,120
suffered terrible shame remembering the way they 
had abandoned their children and elderly parents.

1854
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:57,520
Although he had always been 
considered a slow-thinking man,  

1855
03:08:58,080 --> 03:09:04,559
Velisarios, who was now forty-two years old and 
stronger than he had ever been, took command  

1856
03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:10,241
in Pelagia's village. With a strength that seemed 
greater than that of the earthquake itself,  

1857
03:09:10,240 --> 03:09:14,479
he threw off the beams and stones that 
imprisoned the crushed body of the doctor,  

1858
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:20,960
because he was aware that decay was 
followed by disease. Then he gathered  

1859
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:26,319
together the confused and hopeless villagers 
and ordered them into small working parties.

1860
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:32,240
For months after the earthquake, there were 
times when the earth would shake and tremble,  

1861
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:39,360
not violently as it had done in the earthquake 
itself, but enough to make people scream in fear.  

1862
03:09:40,319 --> 03:09:46,080
It was Velisarios who told people to get back 
to work, threatening them with broken bones  

1863
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:53,040
unless they returned to their tasks. Even 
Pelagia, who was almost crazy with grief,  

1864
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:57,120
was given the work of caring for 
people's wounds, while Drosoula,  

1865
03:09:57,120 --> 03:10:03,120
who at first could only cry, was put in charge 
of the children so that their parents could work.

1866
03:10:04,720 --> 03:10:09,440
When the aid workers finally arrived at the 
village, they found a small community living  

1867
03:10:09,439 --> 03:10:15,120
in tents made of sheets of iron, with toilets 
dug at a safe distance from the water supply.  

1868
03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:20,080
An enormous man was in charge, who in old age  

1869
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:23,519
would be more loved and respected 
than the teacher or the priest.

1870
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:32,319
For three months the earth moved, as if it was 
breathing. Then, at last, it became quiet and  

1871
03:10:32,319 --> 03:10:37,759
motionless once again, and reconstruction 
began, to be completed three years later.  

1872
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:43,760
Ancient and beautiful Italian towns 
were rebuilt as plain white boxes.  

1873
03:10:44,720 --> 03:10:50,320
Pelagias village was put up further down 
the hill and her old house was abandoned,  

1874
03:10:50,319 --> 03:10:54,960
the contents of the hiding-hole in the 
kitchen buried, it seemed, forever.

1875
03:10:57,120 --> 03:11:00,160
The earthquake changed lives so greatly that,  

1876
03:11:00,160 --> 03:11:05,439
even today, it is still the most important 
topic of conversation in Cephallonia.

1877
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:12,080
Islanders cannot resist informing strangers of 
the facts, and tourist guides will mention the  

1878
03:11:12,080 --> 03:11:15,840
earthquake when it seemed they were 
only going to discuss the weather.  

1879
03:11:16,880 --> 03:11:20,239
Old people remember an event 
according to whether it was before  

1880
03:11:20,800 --> 03:11:26,480
or after the earthquake. The disaster 
caused people to recall the war as  

1881
03:11:26,479 --> 03:11:32,879
unimportant by comparison, and they woke up 
each morning amazed and grateful to be alive.

1882
03:11:34,560 --> 03:11:38,480
In the new house that Pelagia, 
Drosoula and Antonia now lived in,  

1883
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:43,040
Pelagia's guilt was the central 
issue in the three women's lives;  

1884
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:49,840
the thought that she had played a part in her 
father's death made Pelagia suffer horribly.

1885
03:11:50,479 --> 03:11:53,359
'He was seventy,' said Drosoula sensibly.  

1886
03:11:53,920 --> 03:11:57,200
'It was better to die quickly 
like that, trying to save us.'

1887
03:11:58,399 --> 03:12:04,799
But Pelagia could not accept this. She 
knew that in the moment of disaster,  

1888
03:12:04,800 --> 03:12:09,840
her mind had been spinning with nothing 
except the need to save herself, and she  

1889
03:12:09,840 --> 03:12:15,600
knew that when her father had fallen she should 
have tried, even at the risk of her own life,  

1890
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:22,720
to drag him through the door before the roof fell 
in. She fell into a bottomless pit of self-blame,  

1891
03:12:23,359 --> 03:12:28,719
took no interest in her appearance and 
did not perform her household tasks,  

1892
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:35,440
preferring to sit by the doctor's grave, 
chewing her lips until they bled. With her  

1893
03:12:35,439 --> 03:12:43,599
untidy greying hair and her pale face, she simply 
sat and watched, as if expecting his ghost to rise  

1894
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:52,000
up through the earth and speak to her. Time after 
time, in the winter storms and rams, Drosoula  

1895
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:59,840
and Antonia would go to the grave and drag 
Pelagia away, while she sighed and wept.

1896
03:13:00,800 --> 03:13:08,480
One day Antonia and Drosoula could stand no 
more; they began to feel impatient and angry,  

1897
03:13:09,040 --> 03:13:13,840
and the old woman and the young girl discussed 
how they could cure Pelagia of her sorrow.

1898
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:19,519
'Why don't we just tie her to the 
bed and hit her?' suggested Antonia.

1899
03:13:20,479 --> 03:13:23,040
Drosoula sighed with pleasure at the thought  

1900
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:28,640
and for a moment wondered whether or not 
it would work. Then her eyes brightened  

1901
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:34,080
and she kissed the young girl on the top of 
her forehead. 'I've had an idea,' she said.

1902
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:38,880
At breakfast the next morning, 
Antonia suddenly announced,  

1903
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:42,480
'I had a dream about Granddad last night.'

1904
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:45,359
'That's funny,' said Drosoula, 'so did I.'

1905
03:13:46,479 --> 03:13:49,200
They looked at Pelagia for some kind of reaction,  

1906
03:13:49,840 --> 03:13:53,680
but she simply continued to tear 
a piece of bread into tiny pieces.

1907
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:58,640
'He told me he was glad he 
was dead,' said Antonia,  

1908
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:01,120
'because now he can be with Mama's mother.'

1909
03:14:02,319 --> 03:14:06,399
'That's not what he told me,' 
replied Drosoula, and Pelagia asked,  

1910
03:14:07,279 --> 03:14:09,840
'Why are you talking as if I'm not here?'

1911
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:16,479
'Because you're not,' replied Drosoula truthfully. 
'You haven't been here for a long time.'

1912
03:14:17,920 --> 03:14:20,160
'What did he tell you then?' enquired Antonia.

1913
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:26,160
'He told me that he wants Mama to write the 
History of Cephallonia that got buried in  

1914
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:31,519
the earthquake. He said it spoils the fun 
of being dead, knowing that it's got lost.'

1915
03:14:32,640 --> 03:14:38,000
Pelagia regarded them suspiciously 
and Antonia asked her innocently,  

1916
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:39,920
'So are you going to write it?'

1917
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:45,040
'There's no point in asking her,' said 
Drosoula. 'She's on another planet.'

1918
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:49,279
'That's not true,' protested Pelagia.

1919
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:52,720
'Welcome back,' said Drosoula rudely.

1920
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:58,800
Pelagia went back to her father's grave 
and thought about what Drosoula had said;  

1921
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:04,480
although she knew that the story of the 
dream was nonsense, it occurred to her  

1922
03:15:04,479 --> 03:15:08,879
that rewriting the History would indeed be 
a way to keep her father's spirit alive.  

1923
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:15,279
She travelled into Argostoli and returned 
with pens and a thick pad of paper.

1924
03:15:16,399 --> 03:15:22,080
It was surprisingly easy. Although the 
History had been destroyed in the earthquake,  

1925
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:27,200
she had read it so many times that the old 
phrases rolled through the kitchen door  

1926
03:15:27,200 --> 03:15:30,479
and flowed down her arm and 
right hand into her pen:

1927
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:38,000
'The ancient, half-forgotten island of 
Cephallonia rises from the Ionian Sea...'

1928
03:15:39,359 --> 03:15:43,599
Drosoula and Antonia spied on 
her as she sat at her table,  

1929
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:50,800
tapping her teeth with her pen. They crept away to 
a safe distance, embraced each other and danced.

1930
03:15:52,479 --> 03:15:59,519
Pelagia almost became the doctor. She did hardly 
any housework, leaving it all to the women.  

1931
03:16:00,239 --> 03:16:05,279
Her father's pipe had been found in the ruins 
of the old house, and she stuck it between her  

1932
03:16:05,279 --> 03:16:12,080
teeth as he had done, but did not light it. She 
began to add small details to the text that she  

1933
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:17,279
remembered so well, supplying information 
about such matters as clothes and baking,  

1934
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:25,040
and the cruel but traditional treatment of widows. 
The joy of the work caused a deep change in her.  

1935
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:30,480
She sent letters of enquiry to universities 
and discovered that all over the world there  

1936
03:16:30,479 --> 03:16:35,759
were people who loved knowledge so much that they 
would spend months making enquiries on her behalf.

1937
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:42,960
Finally, at the end of 1961, she put 
her completed work into an enormous file  

1938
03:16:43,600 --> 03:16:47,600
and wondered what to do next. 
She learnt from publishers  

1939
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:53,040
that such a book would have no market and was 
advised instead to give it to a university.  

1940
03:16:53,840 --> 03:17:00,400
'I will when I'm dead,' thought Pelagia, and she 
left it proudly on her shelf as visible evidence  

1941
03:17:00,399 --> 03:17:04,799
of the fact that she was an intellectual 
in the tradition of the Ancient Greeks.

1942
03:17:06,399 --> 03:17:12,799
By this time Antonia was a fresh and beautiful 
seventeen-year-old, who opposed her adopted  

1943
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:18,320
mother's ideas as a matter of principle, and the 
two would sit up late into the night discussing  

1944
03:17:18,319 --> 03:17:26,080
philosophy. 'When you're my age, you'll look 
back and see I was right,' Pelagia would say.

1945
03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:31,439
Antonia had no intention of reaching 
Pelagia's age and said so. 'I want  

1946
03:17:31,439 --> 03:17:36,319
to die before I'm twenty-five,' she 
said. 'I don't want to get old. You  

1947
03:17:36,319 --> 03:17:40,719
old people caused all the problems and 
it's us young ones who have to solve them.'

1948
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:44,840
'Enjoy your dreams,' commented Pelagia.
 
 
 

1949
03:17:48,640 --> 03:17:49,520
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1950
03:17:50,319 --> 03:17:50,880
Alexi

1951
03:17:52,640 --> 03:17:59,280
It was about this time that mysterious postcards 
in rather poor Greek began to arrive from all  

1952
03:17:59,279 --> 03:18:06,080
over the world. From Santa Fe came one that said, 
'You would like it here. All the houses are made  

1953
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:14,960
of mud.' From London: 'Mad people: terrible 
fog.' From Madrid: 'Too hot. Everyone asleep.'

1954
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:21,280
Although Pelagia's first thought was that 
her father's ghost was visiting his favourite  

1955
03:18:21,279 --> 03:18:26,880
countries and was sending her communications 
from beyond the grave, her second thought was  

1956
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:35,120
that they might be from Antonio. But he too was 
dead. Perhaps, she thought, these unsigned cards  

1957
03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:41,279
were from someone with whom she had exchanged 
letters during the writing of the History. Puzzled  

1958
03:18:41,279 --> 03:18:45,920
but pleased, she tied her collections 
of cards together and put them in a box.

1959
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:52,319
'You've got a secret boyfriend,' suggested 
Antonia, who was pleased to discuss the  

1960
03:18:52,319 --> 03:18:57,599
matter since it drew attention away from 
her own romantic affairs, which both Pelagia  

1961
03:18:57,600 --> 03:18:59,680
and Drosoula were attempting to discourage.

1962
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:06,319
They had met while Antonia was earning a little 
money by serving coffee in a cafe on the plaza  

1963
03:19:06,319 --> 03:19:13,439
of Argostoli. There had been a noisy band playing 
in the square, and the gentleman who had had to  

1964
03:19:13,439 --> 03:19:18,960
rise and shout his order in the young girl's 
ear had at the same moment realized what a  

1965
03:19:18,960 --> 03:19:26,160
deliciously attractive ear it was. Antonia 
had also realized that here was a man whose  

1966
03:19:26,160 --> 03:19:32,800
eyes expressed exactly the correct mixture of 
strength and gentleness, calmness and humour.

1967
03:19:34,160 --> 03:19:40,479
Alexi waited at the cafe day after day, choosing 
the same table whenever he could, his heart  

1968
03:19:40,479 --> 03:19:46,160
bursting with his desire to see the tall young 
woman with her perfect teeth and long fingers.  

1969
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:50,559
She brought him his coffee eagerly, 
forbidding the other girls,  

1970
03:19:51,200 --> 03:19:57,920
the waiters, and even the owner himself 
to serve him. One day he took her hand  

1971
03:19:57,920 --> 03:20:03,840
while she was putting down a cup, looked 
passionately up at her and said, 'Marry me.'

1972
03:20:05,200 --> 03:20:11,679
Alexi was a lawyer whose skilful speeches could 
make a judge weep, but while Pelagia recognized  

1973
03:20:11,680 --> 03:20:18,160
his excellence in this area, she could not stand 
the thought of him marrying Antonia. She was very  

1974
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:27,760
tall, he was short. She was only seventeen, and 
he was thirty-two. She was tall and graceful,  

1975
03:20:27,760 --> 03:20:34,400
he was overweight and had a habit of tripping 
over things. Pelagia remembered her passion for  

1976
03:20:34,399 --> 03:20:41,920
Mandras at the same age and forbade the marriage, 
certain that this was the right thing to do.

1977
03:20:41,920 --> 03:20:48,399
The wedding day was nevertheless 
delightful. Antonia, beaming with happiness,  

1978
03:20:48,399 --> 03:20:54,799
kissed even the strangers who had come to 
stare, and Alexi, sweating with alcohol and joy,  

1979
03:20:54,800 --> 03:21:00,640
made a long and extremely poetic speech, much of 
it very wisely in praise of his mother-in-law.  

1980
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:06,960
She would always remember the exact moment during 
the celebrations when she had seen what it was  

1981
03:21:06,960 --> 03:21:13,439
about him that had awakened Antonia's heart. It 
was when he put his arm around her, kissed her  

1982
03:21:13,439 --> 03:21:18,559
on the cheek and said, 'We are going to buy a 
house in your village, with your permission.'  

1983
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:25,359
The humble tone of his voice and his implied 
doubt that she might not want him near her  

1984
03:21:25,359 --> 03:21:28,639
was enough to cause her to 
become extremely fond of him.

1985
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:35,920
While Pelagia waited impatiently for a grandchild, 
Drosoula became deeply involved in work.  

1986
03:21:36,960 --> 03:21:41,359
In the empty space by the harbour 
that had once been her own house,  

1987
03:21:41,359 --> 03:21:47,759
she put up a wooden roof and some romantic lamps. 
She borrowed some ancient tables and chairs,  

1988
03:21:48,399 --> 03:21:52,639
bought a cheap oven and 
grandly started the taverna  

1989
03:21:52,640 --> 03:21:59,201
that she would run eccentrically but with great 
success until the day of her death in 1972.

1990
03:22:00,800 --> 03:22:07,360
It was the 1960s, and tourists were just 
beginning to arrive in Cephallonia. Wealthy  

1991
03:22:07,359 --> 03:22:12,639
boat owners passed on information to their 
friends about the most unusual places to eat.  

1992
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:19,760
German soldiers who had turned into gentle 
citizens with vast families brought their sons  

1993
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:25,280
and daughters and told them, 'This is where 
Daddy was in the war. Isn't it beautiful?'  

1994
03:22:26,239 --> 03:22:33,359
Italians arrived by ferry, bringing their pretty 
white dogs. Consequently, as the owner of the only  

1995
03:22:33,359 --> 03:22:39,120
taverna in the little port, Drosoula earned enough 
in the summer to do nothing at all in the winter.

1996
03:22:40,319 --> 03:22:45,679
Lemoni, who was now married, immensely 
fat and the mother of three children,  

1997
03:22:45,680 --> 03:22:51,440
helped with the serving, and Pelagia came down, 
taking the opportunity to practise her Italian.  

1998
03:22:52,479 --> 03:23:00,160
The service was not fast; to tell the truth, 
it was extremely slow. The guests were treated  

1999
03:23:00,160 --> 03:23:06,239
unapologetically as members of Drosoula's patient 
family, and quite often there was no service at  

2000
03:23:06,239 --> 03:23:11,439
all if Drosoula happened to like a particular 
customer with whom she was deep in conversation.  

2001
03:23:12,640 --> 03:23:18,320
The foreigners, who loved and feared her, never 
complained about her forgetfulness and her  

2002
03:23:18,319 --> 03:23:25,439
indefinite delays, and would say, 'She's so nice, 
poor old thing, it seems a shame to hurry her.'

2003
03:23:27,120 --> 03:23:32,640
Meanwhile, year after year, Pelagia 
waited for a grandchild that never came.  

2004
03:23:33,520 --> 03:23:40,400
'It's my body,' declared Antonia, 'and I have the 
right to choose. Anyway, the world's population  

2005
03:23:40,399 --> 03:23:46,000
is already too large. Alexi agrees with me, 
so don't think you can go and shout at him.'

2006
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:49,520
'I'm getting old,' Pelagia 
would say, 'that's all.'

2007
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:58,160
Time passed. It was Drosoula who died first, 
perfectly upright in her rocking chair,  

2008
03:23:58,880 --> 03:24:03,600
so quietly that it seemed she was 
apologizing for having lived at all.  

2009
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:08,800
She was a courageous woman who had lived 
a few short years of happiness with a  

2010
03:24:08,800 --> 03:24:14,640
husband that she had loved, a woman who had 
rejected her son as a matter of principle  

2011
03:24:14,640 --> 03:24:19,040
and lived the rest of her days in 
willing service to her adopted family.

2012
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:25,439
After Drosoula was buried near the doctor, 
Pelagia realized that she was now truly  

2013
03:24:25,439 --> 03:24:32,160
alone. She had no idea any more how to run a 
life, and it was with fear and hopelessness in  

2014
03:24:32,160 --> 03:24:36,960
her heart that she took over Drosoula's 
taverna and attempted to make a living.

2015
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:45,520
Alexi, who by his early thirties had lost all his 
hair, achieved success as a lawyer, as Pelagia  

2016
03:24:45,520 --> 03:24:54,240
had known he would, and acquired, among other 
things, a big Citroen car. When at last, in 1979,  

2017
03:24:54,239 --> 03:25:00,639
Antonia gave in to the demands of nature and 
became pregnant, she and Alexi started to  

2018
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:07,840
hold hands again in public, stared dreamily at 
babies and made long lists of possible names.

2019
03:25:08,399 --> 03:25:13,839
'It's going to be a girl,' said Pelagia. 
'Really, you must call her Drosoula.'

2020
03:25:14,640 --> 03:25:16,640
'But Drosoula was so big and...'

2021
03:25:17,359 --> 03:25:22,719
'Ugly? It doesn't matter. We loved 
her anyway. Her name should live.'

2022
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:25,840
'Oh, I don't know, Mama...'

2023
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:29,360
'I am an old woman,' declared Pelagia,  

2024
03:25:29,359 --> 03:25:34,719
who gained great satisfaction from repeating 
this statement. 'It might be my last wish.'

2025
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:39,040
'You're sixty. These days that isn't old.'

2026
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:40,720
'Well, I feel old.'

2027
03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:41,680
'You don't look it.'

2028
03:25:42,399 --> 03:25:47,200
'I didn't bring you up to be a liar,' said 
Pelagia, terribly pleased, nevertheless.

2029
03:25:48,239 --> 03:25:51,439
'I'm thirty-four,' said Antonia. 'That's old.'

2030
03:25:53,359 --> 03:25:58,000
When the little boy appeared, Pelagia 
began to refer to the child as Iannis,  

2031
03:25:58,560 --> 03:26:04,480
and she did this so frequently that it soon seemed 
obvious to its parents that it could not be called  

2032
03:26:04,479 --> 03:26:11,919
by any other name. If you called it Iannis, 
it smiled and blew bubbles, so Iannis it was.

2033
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:18,479
Alexi, now realizing that a man must pass 
something on to his son, began to look around  

2034
03:26:18,479 --> 03:26:24,080
for good investments. He built a small block 
of holiday apartments and installed a modern  

2035
03:26:24,080 --> 03:26:30,239
kitchen and toilets in the taverna. He persuaded 
Pelagia to allow him to hire a proper cook,  

2036
03:26:30,239 --> 03:26:36,559
leaving her as the manager, and they split 
the profits fifty-fifty. On the white walls  

2037
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:46,000
Pelagia stuck all the postcards that continued 
to arrive from the four corners of the world.
 
 
 

2038
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:46,960
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

2039
03:26:47,760 --> 03:26:49,120
An Unexpected Lesson

2040
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:57,359
At five years old, Iannis, who spent nearly all 
his time at the taverna in his grandmother's care,  

2041
03:26:57,359 --> 03:27:04,319
already knew how to say 'Hello' and 'Isn't he 
sweet?' in six different languages. The reason  

2042
03:27:04,319 --> 03:27:08,880
for his continual presence at the 'Taverna 
Drosoula' was that his father was building  

2043
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:14,960
new holiday apartments and tennis courts and his 
mother was opening shops that sold cheap souvenirs  

2044
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:21,920
all over the island. Their son grew up contentedly 
in his grandmother's company, playing in the clear  

2045
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:28,640
waters of the port and slowly learning the Italian 
that Pelagia insisted on speaking to him. In the  

2046
03:27:28,640 --> 03:27:35,680
evening, the reunited family would sit together in 
the taverna, arguing both in Italian and in Greek,  

2047
03:27:35,680 --> 03:27:39,760
while Pelagia would embarrass Iannis 
with references to his infant years.

2048
03:27:41,439 --> 03:27:47,200
When he was ten years old, Pelagia hired a bozouki 
player to entertain her guests in the taverna.  

2049
03:27:47,920 --> 03:27:52,560
His name was Spiridon and he 
played his bozouki with such skill  

2050
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:56,720
that he could persuade even the Germans to 
put their arms around each other's shoulders  

2051
03:27:56,720 --> 03:28:04,240
and dance in a circle while stamping on the floor. 
Iannis loved Spiridon, with his broad shoulders  

2052
03:28:04,239 --> 03:28:10,479
and his wide mouth that seemed to contain a 
hundred flashing teeth. Pelagia also loved  

2053
03:28:10,479 --> 03:28:16,399
him because he reminded her of her long-lost 
captain, and occasionally her heart wished  

2054
03:28:16,399 --> 03:28:22,160
desperately for a time-machine to take her back 
to the days of the only real love of her life.

2055
03:28:23,600 --> 03:28:29,280
Iannis did not fail to notice that Spiridon 
was popular with women, who at the end of every  

2056
03:28:29,279 --> 03:28:34,399
performance would seize the red roses from 
the vases in the middle of their tables, and  

2057
03:28:34,399 --> 03:28:41,839
throw them at him. So one day Iannis demanded that 
Spiridon should teach him how to play the bozouki.

2058
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:47,760
'Your arms aren't long enough yet,' 
said Spiro. 'It would make more sense  

2059
03:28:47,760 --> 03:28:53,280
to start with a mandolin. It's the same 
thing really, but small enough for you.'

2060
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:55,359
'Will you teach me to play it?'

2061
03:28:56,160 --> 03:29:02,960
'Of course, but we'll have to find a mandolin. 
Otherwise we might have to do just the theory.'

2062
03:29:04,479 --> 03:29:09,279
Iannis begged his mother and father to get 
him one, and they promised to buy one when  

2063
03:29:09,279 --> 03:29:17,840
they next went to Athens, but forgot. Eventually 
Pelagia told him, 'In fact we have one already,  

2064
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:23,520
but it's buried under the old house. I am 
sure Antonio wouldn't mind you digging it up.'

2065
03:29:24,319 --> 03:29:25,279
'Who's Antonio?'

2066
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:31,600
'My Italian fiance who was killed in 
the war. It belonged to him. There  

2067
03:29:31,600 --> 03:29:36,240
was a big trapdoor in the middle of the 
floor and it was in a hole underneath.'

2068
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:44,080
So Iannis dragged Spiridon up the hill and showed 
him a ghostly ruin overgrown with long grass,  

2069
03:29:44,720 --> 03:29:47,840
its broken stones just visible above the growth.  

2070
03:29:48,560 --> 03:29:53,201
All around it lay the silent and 
deserted remains of lonely little houses.

2071
03:29:54,720 --> 03:29:57,120
'It's the saddest place,' said Iannis.  

2072
03:29:57,760 --> 03:30:04,960
'I come here to explore sometimes.' He pointed. 
'My grandfather died in there. I'm named after  

2073
03:30:04,960 --> 03:30:11,200
him. Grandma says he was the best doctor in Greece 
and that he could cure people by touching them.'

2074
03:30:12,319 --> 03:30:16,160
The two of them went through what had 
once been the door and scratched their  

2075
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:21,760
heads when they saw the rubbish that lay all 
around. Spiro blew out his cheeks and sighed.  

2076
03:30:22,960 --> 03:30:27,680
'We've got two days work here,' he said. 
'We'll just have to get on with it.'

2077
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:33,840
By the next evening there was a clear 
space in the middle of the old floor  

2078
03:30:33,840 --> 03:30:37,920
and the trapdoor lay revealed in the 
area that had once been the kitchen.  

2079
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:44,000
Spiro tried to get his fingers under the 
iron ring of the door but, hard as he tried,  

2080
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:50,239
he could not move it. He and the child were 
gazing at the ring and scratching their heads  

2081
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:56,479
when they became aware of a very big old man in a 
black suit, standing a little bent in the doorway.  

2082
03:30:57,760 --> 03:31:04,160
'What are you doing?' he asked. 'Oh, it's you, 
young Iannis. I thought you were looters.'

2083
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:08,479
'We're trying to open this,' 
said the boy. 'It's stuck,  

2084
03:31:08,479 --> 03:31:10,479
and it's got something inside that we want.'

2085
03:31:11,439 --> 03:31:17,839
The old man came inside and examined the trapdoor 
with his watery eyes before slowly bending down  

2086
03:31:18,399 --> 03:31:22,080
and putting the tips of the fingers 
of one hand under the iron ring.  

2087
03:31:23,120 --> 03:31:29,120
He leaned sideways, putting all his weight and 
strength into lifting the ring and, with a sudden  

2088
03:31:29,120 --> 03:31:36,960
loud crack, the door flew upwards in a cloud 
of dust. Velisarios rubbed his hands together,  

2089
03:31:37,520 --> 03:31:43,201
blew on the tips of his fingers and seemed 
suddenly to become a tired old man again.  

2090
03:31:44,479 --> 03:31:50,399
'Goodbye, my friends,' he said, and made his 
way slowly down the path to the new village.

2091
03:31:52,000 --> 03:31:54,479
'Unbelievable,' said Spiro.

2092
03:31:55,840 --> 03:32:02,239
Inside the hiding-place, in perfect condition, 
they found an antique German record player,  

2093
03:32:02,880 --> 03:32:06,800
a handmade blanket, a bundle 
of papers written in Italian  

2094
03:32:07,359 --> 03:32:12,160
and another package of papers with the 
title, 'A Personal History of Cephallonia'.  

2095
03:32:13,279 --> 03:32:19,679
There was also a cloth bundle containing the 
most beautiful mandolin that Spiro had ever seen.

2096
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:25,120
When Iannis showed Pelagia the 
mandolin, she started crying  

2097
03:32:25,840 --> 03:32:33,920
and, to Iannis's amazement, she did not stop for a 
whole week. Iannis comforted her as best he could,  

2098
03:32:33,920 --> 03:32:40,000
climbing on to her knees, which he was really 
a little too old for, and wiping her tears,  

2099
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:45,520
wondering how it was possible to love an old 
woman with stiff knees and thin grey hair so much.  

2100
03:32:46,720 --> 03:32:51,920
While Iannis comforted Pelagia, Spiro 
carefully cleaned and polished the mandolin.  

2101
03:32:52,560 --> 03:32:58,320
He tightened and tuned each string and 
told Iannis, with great seriousness,  

2102
03:32:58,319 --> 03:33:03,840
that the mandolin was the most precious thing he 
would ever own, so that Iannis learned to regard  

2103
03:33:03,840 --> 03:33:09,360
the instrument with a respect that he had never 
felt in church, when dragged there by Pelagia.

2104
03:33:10,120 --> 03:33:11,120
***

2105
03:33:11,120 --> 03:33:18,319
In October 1993 Iannis was fourteen, and he had 
had a whole summer in which to play in public  

2106
03:33:18,319 --> 03:33:24,960
with Spiridon and have red roses thrown at him. 
In order not to annoy his grandmother with his  

2107
03:33:24,960 --> 03:33:30,960
constant practising - in fact not to make her cry 
again - he had gone up to the ruins of the old  

2108
03:33:30,960 --> 03:33:37,040
house to play in private, and was concentrating 
very hard on a particularly difficult piece of  

2109
03:33:37,040 --> 03:33:44,319
music. He was biting his lip with the effort, 
and did not notice an old man who approached him  

2110
03:33:44,319 --> 03:33:49,920
and watched him with critical but 
delighted interest. Iannis nearly  

2111
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:56,880
jumped out of his seat when a voice said, in 
a very strange accent, 'Excuse me, young man.'

2112
03:33:57,520 --> 03:34:01,121
'Ah!' Iannis exclaimed. 'You frightened me.'

2113
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:07,599
'I couldn't help noticing,' said the man, 
'that you are doing something wrong.'

2114
03:34:08,720 --> 03:34:15,280
'I know, I'm having trouble with this piece,' 
replied Iannis, noticing how unusually bright-eyed  

2115
03:34:15,279 --> 03:34:20,960
the old man was, and how there was about 
him an atmosphere of energy and laughter.

2116
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:28,960
'Let me show you how to place your fingers.' The 
old man came over to Iannis and started to pull  

2117
03:34:28,960 --> 03:34:34,319
the boy's fingers into place, explaining 
as he did so why the fingers were better  

2118
03:34:34,319 --> 03:34:40,639
in this position. Then he stood upright and 
added, 'You can always tell a really good  

2119
03:34:40,640 --> 03:34:45,201
musician because a good musician doesn't 
seem to be moving his fingers at all.'

2120
03:34:46,080 --> 03:34:48,319
'You seem to know a lot about it,' said Iannis.

2121
03:34:48,880 --> 03:34:53,120
'Well, I ought to. I've been a 
professional mandolin player for  

2122
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:57,120
nearly all my life. I can tell 
that you're going to be good.'

2123
03:34:58,399 --> 03:35:01,759
'Play me something?' asked the 
boy, offering him the mandolin.  

2124
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:08,880
The old man took the mandolin, settled it into 
this body and began to play in such a way that  

2125
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:16,960
Iannis's mouth fell open with amazement. Suddenly 
the old man stopped, turned the mandolin over,  

2126
03:35:17,600 --> 03:35:25,201
examined it with an expression of disbelief 
and exclaimed, 'Mother of God, it's Antonia.'

2127
03:35:26,720 --> 03:35:29,600
'How did you know it's called Antonia?'  

2128
03:35:30,319 --> 03:35:35,359
asked Iannis, both surprised and 
suspicious. 'Have you seen it before?'

2129
03:35:36,640 --> 03:35:39,360
'Where did you find it? Who gave it to you?'

2130
03:35:40,399 --> 03:35:44,319
'I dug it out of that hole,' said 
Iannis, pointing to the open trapdoor.  

2131
03:35:45,200 --> 03:35:46,639
'Grandma told me it was there.'

2132
03:35:47,920 --> 03:35:53,680
'And would your grandmother be Kyria 
Pelagia, daughter of Dr Iannis?'

2133
03:35:54,479 --> 03:35:57,120
'That's me. I'm called Iannis, after him.'

2134
03:35:58,319 --> 03:36:04,000
The old man sat next to the boy on the wall, 
still holding the mandolin, and wiped his  

2135
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:07,760
forehead with a handkerchief, 
seeming suddenly very anxious.  

2136
03:36:09,200 --> 03:36:20,160
'Tell me, young man, is your grandmother 
alive? Is she happy?' he asked finally.

2137
03:36:20,160 --> 03:36:25,279
'She cries sometimes, ever since we dug Antonia 
and all the other things out of the hole.'

2138
03:36:26,640 --> 03:36:29,600
'And what about your grandfather? Is he well?'

2139
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:34,880
The boy seemed confused. 
'What grandfather?' he asked.

2140
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:40,479
'Not your father's father. I 
mean Kyria Pelagia's husband,'  

2141
03:36:40,479 --> 03:36:42,639
said the old man, wiping his forehead again.

2142
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:46,480
'There isn't one. I didn't even know she had one.'

2143
03:36:47,680 --> 03:36:53,201
'Are you saying that Kyria Pelagia hasn't got 
a husband? You haven't got a grandfather?'

2144
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:55,439
'I suppose I must have,  

2145
03:36:56,160 --> 03:37:01,760
but I've never heard of him. I've only got 
my father's father, and he's half-dead.'

2146
03:37:02,720 --> 03:37:10,880
The old man stood up, looked around him and said, 
'This was a beautiful place. I had the best years  

2147
03:37:10,880 --> 03:37:16,800
of my life here. And do you know what? I 
was going to marry your grandmother once.  

2148
03:37:18,080 --> 03:37:20,000
I think it's time I saw her again.'

2149
03:37:21,600 --> 03:37:25,360
The two of them were walking down the 
hill when Iannis stopped suddenly.  

2150
03:37:26,239 --> 03:37:32,160
'If you're the one who played the mandolin and was 
going to marry Grandma... does that mean you're  

2151
03:37:32,160 --> 03:37:44,160
the ghost?' The autumnal sun shone briefly through 
the cloud, and the old man paused for thought.
 
 
 

2152
03:37:44,160 --> 03:37:45,760
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

2153
03:37:45,760 --> 03:37:46,320
The Return

2154
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:55,280
Antonio Corelli, although in his seventies, 
rediscovered a certain youthful energy in his old  

2155
03:37:55,279 --> 03:38:01,599
limbs as he danced about, trying to avoid being 
hit by the frying pans that Pelagia was busily  

2156
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:10,800
throwing at him. 'You pig!' she screamed. 'All my 
life waiting, all my life thinking you were dead.  

2157
03:38:10,800 --> 03:38:16,000
And you alive and me a fool. How can 
you break such promises? Betrayer!'

2158
03:38:17,359 --> 03:38:23,279
Corelli backed against the wall, trying to hold 
off the broomstick that Pelagia was waving at him.  

2159
03:38:23,279 --> 03:38:26,639
'I told you,' he cried. 'I 
thought you were married.'

2160
03:38:27,760 --> 03:38:32,239
'Married!' she exclaimed bitterly. 
'No such luck! Thanks to you,  

2161
03:38:32,239 --> 03:38:38,080
you rat.' She made a move as if she was going to 
hit him across the head with the broom handle.

2162
03:38:38,760 --> 03:38:43,280
'I came back for you. 1946. I came  

2163
03:38:43,279 --> 03:38:47,519
round the bend and there you were with 
the little baby, looking so happy.'

2164
03:38:48,160 --> 03:38:54,559
'Was I married? Who told you that? So I adopt 
a baby that someone leaves on my doorstep...  

2165
03:38:54,560 --> 03:38:58,960
Couldn't you have said, "Excuse 
me, but is this your baby?"'

2166
03:38:58,960 --> 03:39:04,399
'Please stop hitting me. I came back 
every year, you know I did. You saw me,  

2167
03:39:04,399 --> 03:39:11,839
I always saw you with the child. I was so 
bitter I couldn't speak. But I had to see you.'

2168
03:39:12,880 --> 03:39:16,640
'Bitter? I don't believe my ears. You? Bitter?'

2169
03:39:17,600 --> 03:39:24,800
'For ten years,' said Corelli, 'for ten years 
I was so bitter that I even wanted to kill you.  

2170
03:39:25,760 --> 03:39:33,120
And then I thought, well, OK, I was away for three 
years, perhaps she thought I wasn't coming back,  

2171
03:39:33,680 --> 03:39:37,680
perhaps she thought I was dead, 
perhaps she thought I'd forgotten,  

2172
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:44,720
perhaps she met someone else and fell in love. 
As long as she's happy. But I still came back,  

2173
03:39:44,720 --> 03:39:49,840
every year, just to see you were 
all right. Is that betrayal?'

2174
03:39:50,720 --> 03:39:56,880
'And did you ever see a husband? And did you 
think what it did to me when I ran to you  

2175
03:39:56,880 --> 03:39:59,680
and you disappeared? Did 
you think about my heart?'

2176
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:07,440
'OK, so I jumped the wall and hid. I had 
to. I thought you were married, I told you.  

2177
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:12,319
Pelagia, please, this is a terrible 
embarrassment for the customers.  

2178
03:40:12,319 --> 03:40:14,960
Can't we go for a walk and 
talk about it on the beach?'

2179
03:40:16,399 --> 03:40:20,160
She looked round at all the 
faces, some of them grinning,  

2180
03:40:20,160 --> 03:40:22,160
some of them pretending to look the other way.  

2181
03:40:23,199 --> 03:40:28,720
Everywhere there were overturned chairs and tables 
that Pelagia had thrown to the floor in her anger.  

2182
03:40:29,760 --> 03:40:37,680
'You should have died,' she shouted, 'and left me 
with my dreams. You never loved me.' She marched  

2183
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:44,160
out of the door, leaving Corelli bowing repeatedly 
to the customers and saying, 'Please excuse us.'

2184
03:40:45,760 --> 03:40:51,520
Two hours later they were sitting on a familiar 
rock, gazing out over the sea at the yellow lights  

2185
03:40:51,520 --> 03:40:58,240
of the harbour reflected in the blackened waters. 
'I see you got my postcards, then,' he said.

2186
03:40:59,279 --> 03:41:01,599
'In Greek. Why did you learn Greek?'

2187
03:41:02,560 --> 03:41:08,880
'I was ashamed of being an invader. I was so 
ashamed that I didn't want to be Italian any  

2188
03:41:08,880 --> 03:41:14,480
more. I've been living in Athens for about 
twenty-five years. I'm a Greek citizen.'

2189
03:41:15,439 --> 03:41:16,879
'Did you become a composer?'

2190
03:41:17,760 --> 03:41:24,080
'Yes, I've played my music all over the world. 
I wrote my first big piece of music for you.  

2191
03:41:24,640 --> 03:41:30,800
It's called "Pelagia's March".' He 
noticed that she was trying not to cry,  

2192
03:41:30,800 --> 03:41:37,440
and thought how emotional she had become in her 
old age. She had even knocked out his false teeth,  

2193
03:41:37,439 --> 03:41:41,839
so that they had fallen in the sand 
and had to be washed in the sea.

2194
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:47,920
'I feel like an unfinished poem,' 
said Pelagia, with a heavy sigh.  

2195
03:41:49,199 --> 03:41:52,720
Corelli felt a sting of shame and avoided a reply.

2196
03:41:53,920 --> 03:41:58,319
'Everything's changed. Everything 
here used to be so pretty  

2197
03:41:58,319 --> 03:42:01,279
and now the houses look 
like boxes made of cement.'

2198
03:42:02,399 --> 03:42:07,359
'And we have electricity and telephones 
and running water and proper toilets  

2199
03:42:07,359 --> 03:42:11,040
and earthquake-resistant houses. Is that so bad?'

2200
03:42:12,399 --> 03:42:17,199
There was a silence, during which the 
thoughts of both of them returned to the past.  

2201
03:42:18,800 --> 03:42:21,760
'I see you still have my ring,' he said.

2202
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:27,439
'Only because I couldn't get it off,' 
she answered. 'I had it altered to fit  

2203
03:42:27,439 --> 03:42:36,080
and now I regret it.' She hesitated. 'So 
did you get married? I suppose you did.'

2204
03:42:36,800 --> 03:42:44,720
'Me? No. As I said, I was very bitter for 
years and years. I was horrible to everyone,  

2205
03:42:44,720 --> 03:42:51,120
especially women, and then I became successful 
and I was all over the world, flying from one  

2206
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:56,399
place to another. And, anyway, who wants to be 
with someone who is dreaming of someone else?'

2207
03:42:57,760 --> 03:43:03,120
'Antonio Corelli, I can see that you can 
still tell lies with your silver tongue.  

2208
03:43:03,920 --> 03:43:10,640
And how can you bear to look at me now? I'm an 
old woman. I feel ashamed to be so old and ugly.  

2209
03:43:11,439 --> 03:43:16,879
You look the same, just old and thin, 
but I look like someone else, I know it.  

2210
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:22,000
I want you to remember me 
properly. Now I'm just a lump.'

2211
03:43:23,120 --> 03:43:30,160
'You forget that I came to spy on you. If you 
see things happen gradually, there's no shock.  

2212
03:43:30,160 --> 03:43:34,559
You're just the same.' He 
squeezed her hand gently and said,  

2213
03:43:35,279 --> 03:43:42,160
'Don't worry, it's still Pelagia. Pelagia 
with a bad temper, but still Pelagia.'

2214
03:43:43,920 --> 03:43:47,840
'Did you ever think that I might have 
been raped and that was why I had a baby?'

2215
03:43:48,800 --> 03:43:50,400
'Yes, I did.'

2216
03:43:51,359 --> 03:43:51,599
'And...?'

2217
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:55,040
'I admit it made a difference.  

2218
03:43:56,080 --> 03:44:01,840
We had some ideas about dishonour then, 
didn't we? Thank God we're not so stupid now.'

2219
03:44:02,720 --> 03:44:05,840
'The man who tried to rape me... I shot him.'

2220
03:44:06,720 --> 03:44:09,840
He looked at her in disbelief. 'You shot him?'

2221
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:15,279
'I was never dishonoured. He was 
the fiance I had before you.'

2222
03:44:16,399 --> 03:44:18,719
'You never said anything about a fiance.'

2223
03:44:19,600 --> 03:44:20,000
'Jealous?'

2224
03:44:20,640 --> 03:44:25,760
'Of course I'm jealous.' The emotion was 
beginning to stir him a little too much  

2225
03:44:26,319 --> 03:44:31,840
and he tried to control his feelings. Pelagia 
decided it was time to change the subject.  

2226
03:44:33,040 --> 03:44:37,439
'I want to show you something. You 
never read Carlo's papers, did you?  

2227
03:44:38,160 --> 03:44:44,399
Come back to the taverna and eat, and I'll give 
you his writing. We do an excellent snails dish.'

2228
03:44:45,040 --> 03:44:49,439
'Snails!' he exclaimed. 'I 
remember all about snails.'

2229
03:44:51,040 --> 03:44:56,399
Corelli sat at the table with its plastic cloth 
and read through the stiff old sheets that had  

2230
03:44:56,399 --> 03:45:03,519
curled up at the corners. As he read, he frowned, 
and once or twice he blinked as if in disbelief.  

2231
03:45:04,560 --> 03:45:10,480
When he had finished reading, Pelagia came 
and sat opposite him. 'Well?' she asked.

2232
03:45:11,439 --> 03:45:12,960
He tapped the pile of papers.  

2233
03:45:14,800 --> 03:45:21,120
'I wish you hadn't shown me these. I'm more 
old-fashioned than I thought. I had no idea.'

2234
03:45:22,399 --> 03:45:24,639
'He loved you. Are you disgusted?'

2235
03:45:25,520 --> 03:45:28,720
'Sad... It's a shock. I can't help it.'

2236
03:45:30,080 --> 03:45:36,000
'He wasn't just another hero, was he? 
He was more complicated. Poor Carlo.'

2237
03:45:37,600 --> 03:45:44,000
They began to talk more freely. 'Are 
you very famous then?' Pelagia asked.

2238
03:45:44,960 --> 03:45:47,840
'Only in the sense that other 
musicians have heard of me.  

2239
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:51,600
I've retired now... In fact, I was thinking...  

2240
03:45:52,560 --> 03:45:58,800
I want to rebuild the old house. I want to 
live in a nice place. A place with memories.'

2241
03:46:00,160 --> 03:46:02,399
'Without water and electricity?'

2242
03:46:02,399 --> 03:46:05,599
'I'll put them in. Would you sell me the site?'

2243
03:46:06,239 --> 03:46:09,599
'You're insane. I don't even know if we own it.'

2244
03:46:10,720 --> 03:46:16,000
'Then you don't mind. I'd pay you to 
come and clean it,' he said wickedly.

2245
03:46:16,800 --> 03:46:22,000
She took him seriously. 'What? Do 
I need money? With this taverna?  

2246
03:46:22,000 --> 03:46:25,840
Go home to Athens. Anyway, Lemoni would do it.'

2247
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:28,480
'Little Lemoni? She's still here?'

2248
03:46:29,040 --> 03:46:31,439
'She's as big as a ship and a grandmother.'

2249
03:46:32,560 --> 03:46:35,840
He fell silent again, 
remembering the past, then said,  

2250
03:46:37,279 --> 03:46:40,719
'So do I have your permission 
to rebuild the house?'

2251
03:46:41,600 --> 03:46:44,240
'No,' she said, still holding on to her anger.

2252
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:51,599
'Oh.' He looked at her doubtfully. He would 
return to the topic at a later date, he decided.  

2253
03:46:52,880 --> 03:46:57,199
'I'm going to come and see you 
tomorrow,' he said, 'with a surprise.'

2254
03:46:58,160 --> 03:47:03,920
'I don't want any surprises. Go to hell 
with your surprises. You owe me a life.'

2255
03:47:03,920 --> 03:47:06,480
'Ah. I'll bring you a life then.'

2256
03:47:07,199 --> 03:47:08,479
'Stupid old man.'

2257
03:47:10,319 --> 03:47:16,960
He turned up the next day with screaming brakes 
in a cloud of blue smoke. Pelagia shook her head  

2258
03:47:16,960 --> 03:47:22,960
disapprovingly as he climbed carefully off the 
motorbike, which was bright red and looked as if  

2259
03:47:22,960 --> 03:47:29,600
it had been designed for racing. 'Do you know 
where we're going?' the captain said. 'We're  

2260
03:47:29,600 --> 03:47:35,520
going to see if Casa Nostra is still there...' 
he tapped the machine '... on a motorbike.'

2261
03:47:36,640 --> 03:47:39,360
'Do you really think the 
hut survived the earthquake?  

2262
03:47:39,920 --> 03:47:43,840
And do you really think I'm going 
on a thing like that? At my age?'

2263
03:47:44,640 --> 03:47:47,680
'I hired it specially. It goes very well.'

2264
03:47:48,560 --> 03:47:51,121
'No,' she said. 'My knees are too stiff.'

2265
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:54,479
'Don't you want to see Casa Nostra?'

2266
03:47:55,439 --> 03:47:56,879
'Not with a madman.'

2267
03:47:57,920 --> 03:48:02,160
'I've got it for two days. We can 
sit on a rock and watch the sea.'  

2268
03:48:03,920 --> 03:48:09,680
It took a long time to persuade her. As they 
swung dangerously from side to side along  

2269
03:48:09,680 --> 03:48:15,360
the stony roads, she held on tightly to his 
waist, her face buried between his shoulders.  

2270
03:48:16,239 --> 03:48:22,319
Corelli noticed that she held on to him even more 
desperately than in the old days, and from time  

2271
03:48:22,319 --> 03:48:27,840
to time he deliberately swung to one side of 
the road so that she would hold him tighter.  

2272
03:48:29,439 --> 03:48:32,319
'May the saints save me,' thought Pelagia,  

2273
03:48:33,120 --> 03:48:41,840
and in search of safety slid her arms right round 
his waist and linked her fingers together.
 
 
 
 

2274
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:42,481
- THE END -
