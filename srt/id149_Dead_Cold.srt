CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,040
A body

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,760
In January, they found the girl's body.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,760
They found it in Pine Crest. Pine Crest is 
a small town about 90 miles from Denver,  

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,480
in the Rocky Mountains. In the past, 
it was famous for silver and gold.  

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,800
But now it's a place where people go on 
vacation; they ski there in the winter  

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,040
and walk in the mountains in the summer. 
Movie stars have homes there. It's beautiful  

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,480
and it's quiet when the snow falls. And the 
snow falls a lot in the winter. Pine Crest  

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,360
isn't usually the kind of place you find a dead 
body. Denver's the place for that, not Pine Crest.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,600
Oh, of course sometimes there are skiing 
accidents, like in all ski resorts. I  

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,960
remember that a young man died about three years 
ago. He was skiing too fast and he went into a  

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,560
tree. It's sad, but it happens. But murder 
- killing someone - well, that's different.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,120
So that January morning my boss, Leo Cohn, Chief 
of the Denver Police, called me into his office.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,600
'Girl's body in Pine Crest, Flick,' said 
Leo. Leo was thin and worked too much.  

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,400
He never sat down. Now, he was standing 
near his desk. 'They found her yesterday.'

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,120
'Oh?' I said.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,640
'It looks like someone killed her,' he said. I 
didn't say anything. 'Murder,' he said, as if I  

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:55,120
didn't understand. I waited. He didn't look at me. 
Then he said, 'I want you to go to Pine Crest.'

19
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,320
'Ha!' I said. 'So that's what you want.  

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,640
But Leo, why me? It's too soon. It 
was just two months ago... I can't!'

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,400
'Flick, you're the best,' he said, 'and you need 
to get out of Denver... it's the best thing.'

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,240
'Listen, Leo...' I started, but I 
stopped. Leo looked me in the eyes.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,000
'Come on, Flick. Bill Gershon, the Chief of Police 
there, is an old friend of mine. He's not happy.  

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,320
If it's murder, it's bad for business. No-one 
wants to ski when there's a killer about.'

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,640
Well, yeah, I thought, as I looked out of 
Leo's window at the city, a dead body was  

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:55,120
bad for business. I knew Pine Crest. I used to 
go skiing there on the weekends. The town made  

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,800
its money from the thousands of visitors who went 
there every year. The restaurants, cafes, hotels,  

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,040
ski school, all made money from the people who 
went to beautiful Pine Crest for their vacation.

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
'And the girl?' I asked. 'Was she a visitor?'

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
Leo smiled. He could see that I was interested.  

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,120
'Yes,' he said. 'She was there on a skiing 
vacation with some friends from college.  

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,320
Someone found her in the swimming pool 
at the hotel where she was staying.'

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
'She died in the swimming 
pool?' I asked. 'I mean...'

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,880
'Looks like somebody drowned her,' Leo said.

35
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
I looked at him.

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,800
'She was twenty-three years old,' Leo said softly.

37
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
'And?' I asked.

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,240
'You'll get what you need from Gershon,' said Leo.

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,160
I got up to leave.

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,840
'Oh, and Flick...' said Leo. I turned at the door.

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,080
'I want you to get this one and I 
want you to get it fast,' he said.  

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,280
'First because it'll make the Denver Police 
Department look good. And we need that.'

43
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,840
'And second because you think it's good for me to 
get out of the office and back to work?' I said.

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,560
Leo didn't say anything, but it was 
true. He was helping me in his way.

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:46,320
'OK, Leo,' I said, 'but remember, it was just 
November, just two months ago... that Scott...'

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:59,840
'Yeah, yeah, I know. But Flick, Scott's dead,' 
said Leo. His voice was kind, but strong. 'And  

47
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,760
you've got to live.' He turned away from me 
and looked out of the window. Leo was finished.

48
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,240
I walked to my office to get the things 
I needed for a few days out of town:  

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,560
my notebook, cell phone and car keys. I 
thought about November, thought about Scott.  

50
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,600
Detective Scott King of the Denver Police. 
Then I took my gun and put it under my jacket.

51
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:41,200
I went downstairs to the parking lot. Scott and I 
worked together for four years. We were the best,  

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:49,600
the best the Denver Police Department had. 
We loved catching killers, robbers, all of  

53
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,560
Denver's criminals. But we were more than that, 
we were friends too. Scott was my best friend.  

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,320
Then one stupid, cold day in November, Eddie 
Lang killed Scott. And I saw my best friend die.

55
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,400
'Yeah,' I thought, 'Scott's dead and I've 
got to live.' Most days it was difficult.

56
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,440
I shook my head and Scott's face went away. 
I took my keys out of the pocket of my jacket  

57
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:42,320
and looked at the most beautiful car in the world, 
my red 1957 Chevrolet. My Chevy. I smiled. That  

58
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,400
car always made me smile. Some days it felt 
like it was the only good thing in my life.

59
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,800
I drove home fast to my apartment on Alameda, went 
in and packed a bag. I changed into my blue suit  

60
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
and looked at myself in 
the mirror in the bathroom.  

61
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:10,720
I looked OK. I looked like I came from the 
big city. I felt my gun inside my jacket.  

62
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,800
I was ready. Ready to find 
a killer... without Scott.

63
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,600
Fifteen minutes later, I was 
driving on I70 to Pine Crest,  

64
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:31,360
Colorado. I was trying to forget about Scott. 
And I was trying to forget about Eddie Lang.
 
 
 

65
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,240
CHAPTER TWO

66
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
Pine Crest

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,040
Scott King. Yeah, it was hard to forget. As 
I drove up into the Rocky Mountains pictures  

68
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,840
came into my head. The first time we worked 
together, his smile, the things he said.

69
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:07,520
'Stop it, Flick!' I said to myself. I turned 
on the car radio. It was an old country song.

70
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Then the news came on. 'Good morning, 
listeners,' said the voice. 'It's ten o'clock  

71
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,000
and here's the news. Police found a young 
woman's body in a swimming pool at the  

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Mountain Hotel in Pine Crest yesterday. The 
twenty-three-year-old was a visitor from Texas,  

73
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,840
in the town on a skiing vacation. 
Police believe it was murder.'

74
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,960
I turned the radio off. Scott came back to me. I 
thought about the first time we worked together.

75
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,760
'Flick?' said Scott. 'That's a funny name.' 
We were in a police car in downtown Denver.

76
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,680
'Well, my real name's Felicity,' I said. 
'My dad liked it. There was an English  

77
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:08,960
movie star called Felicity. At school everyone 
thought it was very funny, so I became Flick.'

78
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
'Flick Laine,' he said.

79
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
'Yeah, good, don't you think?' I said.

80
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,440
'Yeah, Scott and Flick,' he 
laughed. 'Denver's crime fighters!'

81
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,440
'Hey, don't you mean Flick and Scott?' I laughed.

82
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Scott and Flick, Flick and Scott.

83
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,320
Now I looked at the road. I tried to think about 
the drive. The road was at 7,000 feet already.  

84
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
But it was a beautiful day in the Rockies.  

85
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Really beautiful. The sky was clear 
blue and you could see for miles.

86
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,680
But I couldn't stop thinking about Scott. I 
thought about the day he died, in November,  

87
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,480
just two months ago. The day we went looking 
for Eddie Lang, one of Denver's worst criminals.  

88
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,840
He killed people for money. But we 
were on to him. We knew where he was.

89
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,840
We were in an old, dark house. We knew 
that Eddie Lang and his men were there.

90
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
'Don't worry, Scott, I'm 
behind you,' I said quietly.

91
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:47,600
I could see Scott in front of me. It was dark, 
but I could just see him. Suddenly I heard a  

92
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:56,400
loud noise. A gun. Then Scott was down on 
the dirty floor. His blood was everywhere.

93
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,280
I ran outside quickly and 
called the police station.  

94
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,560
A few minutes later, more police officers 
arrived. But Scott was dead. Scott was dead  

95
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,760
and Eddie Lang and his men were gone. They 
were gone, but I thought about Scott every day.

96
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,280
I went on driving. An hour later, I drove into 
the parking lot of Pine Crest police station.

97
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,920
Something told me that Bill Gershon, Chief 
of Pine Crest Police, wasn't happy to see me.  

98
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,760
'So,' he said, as I walked into his 
office, 'Leo sent me a woman...'

99
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
'Yeah, aren't you lucky?' I said, smiling.  

100
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:59,760
Gershon didn't smile. I sat down. There were 
still men in the police who thought that women  

101
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,800
police officers and murder didn't go together. 
It looked like Gershon was one of those men.

102
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
'We don't often have murders 
in Pine Crest,' he said.

103
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,520
I looked at Gershon. He was a round person:  

104
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:27,760
round body, round face, round glasses. About 
fifty, fifty-five maybe, with almost no hair.  

105
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:38,160
Then I looked around at his office. Yeah, 
I thought, parking tickets, not murder.

106
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,280
'Listen,' I said. 'Why don't we make this 
easy? Just tell me what I need to know.'

107
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:55,520
The Chief of Police said nothing for a moment or 
two, and then went on. 'Janine Anderson was her  

108
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,520
name. A student from Austin, Texas. She wanted 
to write for a newspaper - to be a journalist.  

109
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,720
This is about her.' He pushed 
some papers towards me.

110
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,320
I looked at the papers. There wasn't 
much. Her name, her parents' names.  

111
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,520
A student of journalism at the University 
of Texas, Austin. Cause of death: drowning.

112
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,080
'Her parents were in Europe on vacation.' 
Gershon shook his head sadly and said:  

113
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,960
'They're coming back today. Coffee?'

114
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,120
It wasn't much, but it was a start.

115
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,840
'Who found her?' I asked, 
drinking the hot black coffee.

116
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:55,520
'Her friend, Teresa Douglas,' said Gershon. 
'They were staying at the Mountain Hotel.'

117
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,840
The Mountain Hotel was in Pine 
Crest. A lot of skiers stayed there.

118
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,280
'They skied all day,' Gershon went on. 'Janine 
went to the swimming pool at about nine o'clock.  

119
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:20,800
The pool is on the top floor of the hotel. She had 
to go upstairs and go outside. At eleven o'clock,  

120
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,080
the Douglas girl went up to look for 
Janine. She found her in the swimming pool.'

121
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,680
'Dead?' I asked.

122
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,640
'Yes,' said Gershon. 'Teresa Douglas 
tried mouth-to-mouth. Then we had a  

123
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:50,160
9-1-1 call at about eleven-fifteen. We were 
there five minutes later. Janine was dead.'

124
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,880
'Did Janine have other friends here?' I asked.

125
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,160
'Yes. Apart from the Douglas 
girl, there's a guy - Jeff Mason,'  

126
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
said the Chief of Police. 
'They're students in Austin.'

127
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,440
'Anything on the body?' I asked. I wanted to 
know if there was a fight before Janine died.

128
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
'On the back of her neck,'  

129
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,400
said Gershon. 'It looks like maybe somebody just 
put her head under the water and drowned her.'

130
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,960
'Well, we don't know that yet,' I said.

131
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,640
'This is terrible!' said Gershon. 'Governor 
Johnson is visiting Pine Crest soon.  

132
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,760
A murder is the last thing we need!'

133
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,720
Clark Johnson was the Governor of Colorado  

134
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:54,720
and everyone said he was the next President of 
the United States. He lived near Pine Crest.

135
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,720
I looked at Gershon. He wasn't 
thinking about the dead girl.  

136
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,520
He was thinking about the bad news, I thought.

137
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:16,000
I finished my coffee and stood up. 'OK, I'm 
going,' I said. 'Here's my cell phone number.'  

138
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,600
I wrote down my number and gave it to Gershon. 
'I'm staying at the Pine Lodge Hotel.'

139
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,840
Gershon came to the door with 
me. He still didn't smile.

140
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:40,560
'Listen,' I said. 'Maybe you don't like it, but 
we have to work together. If this is murder,  

141
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:52,000
we have to find this killer before he, or she, 
kills again.' I looked at Gershon and walked away.

142
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Great, I thought, just what I need - a Chief 
of Police who doesn't want to work with me.  

143
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,080
I went back to my car, took out my winter 
coat and put it on. It was cold here,  

144
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,640
much colder than Denver. We were at 9,000 
feet. But it was a beautiful, clear day  

145
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,880
and there was a smell of wood smoke in the air. 
I walked down the road to the Mountain Hotel.

146
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,240
I looked at the town. It was a pretty place. 
Behind the small houses were the big houses  

147
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,120
of the famous people who lived in Pine 
Crest. Lots of movie stars and famous  

148
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,920
sports people had homes there. Sometimes 
you saw them on the ski runs, in the stores  

149
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,840
or in the more expensive restaurants in the 
town. I looked up to the snow-covered mountains.  

150
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,400
I could see ski runs everywhere, but there were 
only a few people moving down the mountain.  

151
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,000
It was a beautiful day for skiing, cold 
and clear. But no one wanted to ski.  

152
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,040
They thought that there was 
a killer free in the town.
 
 
 

153
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
CHAPTER THREE

154
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
The Mountain Hotel

155
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,320
Then I saw the Mountain Hotel. I walked 
into the hotel and looked over to the bar.  

156
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,160
There was a fire; it was warm and 
comfortable. It looked nice, I thought.

157
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,640
Janine Anderson's friends, 
Teresa Douglas and Jeff Mason,  

158
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:56,960
were in Room 203. They were about twenty-two, 
twenty-three years old. They looked young, lost.

159
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,160
'It's terrible,' said Teresa. Her 
face was wet. She cried softly.  

160
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
Jeff sat down next to her on the bed 
and put his hand on her shoulder.

161
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:20,320
I looked around at the room. It was Jeff's 
room. From the window, you could see a very high  

162
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:28,080
mountain, the one they called Snowpeak. There were 
clothes everywhere, ski boots under the window.

163
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:37,040
'We can't believe she's dead, ma'am. 
It's terrible,' said Jeff. When he spoke,  

164
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,640
I could hear that he came from Texas. He 
was a tall, blond young man, good-looking.

165
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,800
'I understand,' I said. 'I'll try to be 
quick, but I have to ask some questions.'

166
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
'Sure,' said Jeff.

167
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,720
'It was eleven o'clock,' Teresa said, 
'when I went to look for Janine.'

168
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,600
Teresa looked up at me. She had 
dark hair and very white skin.

169
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,960
'You slept in the same room, 
you and Janine?' I asked.

170
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:25,280
'Yes,' she answered, 'me and Janine in one 
room, Room 309, and Jeff in this room.'

171
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,120
I looked at the girl. I gave 
her time to tell her story.

172
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,760
'Janine went to the swimming 
pool at about nine o'clock.  

173
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,680
I fell asleep at about ten-thirty. I 
was very tired; we skied the whole day.  

174
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,800
But I woke up just before eleven o'clock 
and saw that Janine wasn't there.  

175
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:02,720
In her bed, I mean. So I got dressed and went 
up to the top floor. It was really cold outside.  

176
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:13,200
I saw her in the swimming pool. Just on top of 
the water.' The girl put her head in her hands.  

177
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,800
'I can't stop thinking about it,' 
she said. She was quiet for a moment.

178
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,200
'I jumped into the pool,' she went on. 'I 
tried to pull her out of the water, but  

179
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,600
she was too heavy. I turned her over and 
put my mouth to hers, but it was no good.  

180
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,680
I knew it was no good.' Teresa put 
her head in her hands again and cried.

181
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,000
'And there was no-one else around?' 
I asked after a few minutes.

182
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
'I couldn't see anyone,' she said.  

183
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,800
'I shouted out and a hotel worker 
heard me. He called the police.'

184
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,680
'And was Janine a good swimmer?' I asked.

185
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,360
'Oh yes, ma'am,' said Jeff. 
'She was a great swimmer.  

186
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm sure that Janine didn't drown by herself.'

187
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
'And how long have you been here?' I asked.

188
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:31,120
'Almost ten days,' said Jeff. 'We have to 
leave tomorrow. Classes start next week.'

189
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,680
'And do you want to write for a 
newspaper, like Janine?' I asked.

190
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:49,360
'Yes, I do. I study journalism,' said Jeff. His 
face went white. 'Janine wanted so much to be a  

191
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:57,040
writer,' he said. 'It was the thing she wanted 
most in the world. And she was really good.'

192
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,480
'We know each other from the ski club,' 
said Teresa. 'We all loved skiing.'

193
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,560
'Is this your first time 
here in Pine Crest?' I asked.

194
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:22,400
'Mm, yes it is for us,' said Jeff, 'but Janine 
knew it; she came here every year. To ski, I mean.  

195
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:32,640
She was the one... She said it was a lovely place. 
And it's true. We were having a good time here.'

196
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,440
'Did Janine know anyone here in Pine Crest?'  

197
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:45,360
I asked. 'I mean, did she see anyone 
while she was here - a friend - anyone?'

198
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:55,920
Teresa shook her head. 'I don't know,' she 
said. 'I don't think so. Just us, I think.'

199
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:05,280
'But she sometimes went off on her own - 
alone?' I asked. 'Like the night she died?'

200
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,360
'Yes. Janine always went to the pool 
alone in the evenings,' said Teresa.  

201
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,840
'But she didn't talk about anyone. 
I don't think she knew anyone here.  

202
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,000
I think she just thought, or wrote 
in her notebook, and went swimming.'

203
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
'Notebook?' I asked.

204
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:38,240
'Yes, Janine wrote in her notebook every 
day,' said Teresa. 'She wrote about her day,  

205
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:46,640
about her thoughts, her feelings, I think. About 
things that happened to her, things she saw.  

206
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,920
Like Jeff said, she wanted to be 
a writer. She liked to write.'

207
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,080
'And where's her notebook now?' I asked.

208
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:08,240
'Well...' said Teresa, 'in our room, I 
think. She always kept it next to her bed.  

209
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:15,680
She liked to write when she woke up in the 
morning. You know her dreams and things.  

210
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Do you think it could be... Shall I get it?'

211
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
'We can all go,' I said.

212
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:33,120
We all went upstairs to Room 309. It was 
the same as Jeff's room, but with two beds.  

213
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
Teresa looked for the notebook.

214
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,840
'I can't find it,' she said. 'It isn't here!'

215
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,280
'It must be somewhere,' said 
Jeff. 'Shall we help you look?'

216
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,520
'Well, OK,' said Teresa,  

217
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,240
'but it isn't here. Really, it isn't. 
She always kept it next to her bed!'

218
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,800
We looked everywhere in the room. But Teresa 
was right. Janine's notebook was gone.  

219
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,200
Perhaps she took it with her to 
the swimming pool last night?  

220
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,760
I left the dead girl's friends 
with some questions in my head.  

221
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:24,880
Where was Janine Anderson's notebook? Did Janine 
Anderson's killer take it? And if so, why?
 
 
 

222
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,520
CHAPTER FOUR

223
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
A talk with Jeff

224
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,280
I went upstairs to the swimming 
pool where Janine died.  

225
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:47,360
From there you could see everything: the town and 
the mountains. Two of Gershon's men were there.

226
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,240
'Were you here last night?' I asked the men.

227
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,920
'I was, Detective Laine,' said one of them,  

228
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,120
a tall, big guy. 'The name's 
Williams. Sergeant Bob Williams.'

229
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,920
'And did you find anything?' I asked.

230
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,320
'Just a pen,' said Williams.

231
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,040
'A pen?' I said.

232
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,200
'Yes,' he said. 'I found a pen 
just here by the side of the pool.  

233
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,720
They're looking at it - to 
see if it was the girl's.'

234
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,160
It looked like Janine Anderson really was 
writing in her notebook last night, I thought.  

235
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,400
The pen was there, but where was the notebook?

236
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,400
'OK. And one more thing,'  

237
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,760
I said. 'Can you get to the swimming pool 
without going through the hotel reception?'

238
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,600
'Yes,' said Williams. 'You can go through the 
parking lot, and the place they keep the skis,  

239
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,160
then into the elevator.'

240
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
'And the elevator brings you here?' I asked.

241
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
'That's right,' he said.

242
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,920
'No security cameras?' I asked.

243
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,120
'No,' Williams said. 'I 
talked to the hotel manager  

244
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,840
and he told me they never had any problems.'

245
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,120
Until now, I thought, as 
I left the Mountain Hotel.

246
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,400
I went outside into the street. On a wall,  

247
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,560
there was an advertisement. 'Governor 
to run for White House,' it said.

248
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,080
There was a picture of Clark 
Johnson, the Governor of Colorado.  

249
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,920
The elections for President 
were later in the year.

250
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,360
I looked back up to the top 
floor of the Mountain Hotel.  

251
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,800
I couldn't see the pool or Williams 
from here. But maybe from higher up?  

252
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,600
I looked across the street and saw a restaurant 
called the Columbine. You could sit outside at  

253
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:12,240
the top and I could see people at the little 
tables. I went in and walked up the stairs.

254
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,080
I showed the young waiter my police badge. 
I looked over to the Mountain Hotel.  

255
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:28,560
I could see Sergeant Williams next to the pool. 
What if...? The killer could see Janine Anderson  

256
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:35,760
from here! He could sit here in the restaurant 
and wait, then just walk into the hotel.

257
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,080
'Last night,' I said to the waiter, 'did 
you see anything... anyone strange?'

258
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,280
'Strange?' The young man 
thought for a moment. 'Mmm,'  

259
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:59,200
he said, 'well, there was one man... he's 
come here every night for the past ten days.  

260
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:07,840
A slim guy, about thirty-five, always 
alone. Sits here for hours sometimes.'

261
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,800
'And last night?' I asked.

262
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,800
'Last night,' the waiter answered,  

263
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,960
'I thought it was strange because the man asked 
for coffee but he left before the coffee came.'

264
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,200
'He left without paying?' I asked.

265
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:35,840
'No, no,' said the waiter, 'he paid. He left 
some money on the table and just ran out.'

266
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
'What time did he leave?' I asked.

267
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,160
'Oh, I can't remember, I'm sorry,'  

268
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,840
said the waiter. 'We were busy 
last night, but we close at ten.'

269
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,080
'What time do the waiters leave?' I asked.

270
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,960
'Oh, usually about ten-thirty,' he said.

271
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:08,080
So maybe the man just walked across the street, 
through the parking lot and into the hotel  

272
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:15,840
to kill Janine Anderson? And no one could see 
him from the Columbine because it was closed.  

273
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,360
Was the man at the Columbine 
Janine Anderson's killer?

274
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:30,160
I left the Columbine and walked back to the 
police station. I told Gershon about the man  

275
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:37,200
at the Columbine. 'Get Sergeant Williams on 
to it,' I said. 'We need to find that man.'

276
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,800
I got in my car and drove to 
my hotel. The Pine Lodge Hotel  

277
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:52,000
was just half a mile away from the Mountain Hotel. 
I usually stayed at the Pine Lodge when I came  

278
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,840
to Pine Crest for a skiing weekend. It was a 
friendly place with nice, comfortable rooms.

279
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,920
From the window of my room, I looked out 
over the mountains. Then I opened my small  

280
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,840
suitcase, lay on my bed and 
thought about what I knew.

281
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:22,160
It was easy for the killer, I thought. Easy to 
watch Janine from the terrace of the Columbine.  

282
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,840
Easy to get to the swimming pool. But why?

283
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,480
I turned to the phone on the little 
table by the side of the bed.  

284
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,040
I called Leo and told him what I knew so far.

285
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,760
Leo listened. Then he asked, 'How's Bill Gershon?'

286
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,840
'He's surprised I'm a woman,' I 
said. 'You didn't tell him...'

287
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,440
Leo laughed. I laughed too. We 
talked a little and then Leo said:  

288
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,440
'Flick, I have something to tell you.'

289
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,400
'Yes?' I said.

290
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,120
'We found out something today about 
Eddie Lang and Scott's murder,' said Leo.

291
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,440
I sat up quickly and shouted: 'Eddie 
Lang! You mean you know we can get him?'

292
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,840
'Wait,' said Leo. 'Not exactly, 
but I think we're very near.'

293
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
'I'm coming back,' I said. 'I need to be there.'

294
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,120
'No,' said Leo. 'You stay right where you are.  

295
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,960
We'll get Eddie Lang. You get 
Janine Anderson's killer.'

296
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:49,440
I felt weak. I said goodbye to Leo, put the 
phone down and lay down again. It was only three  

297
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,920
o'clock in the afternoon, but I felt tired and 
closed my eyes. Before I knew it, I was asleep.  

298
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,840
I dreamed about Scott, like I often did. 
I dreamed about his blood on the floor.

299
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,080
Then a noise woke me. It was the phone.

300
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,480
'Hello,' I said. My voice was heavy with sleep.

301
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,560
'Detective Laine?'

302
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,120
'Yes, who is it?' I asked.

303
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,880
'It's Jeff Mason - Janine's friend,' said 
the young man. 'I have to talk to you.'

304
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,560
'OK Jeff, sure,' I said. 'Come over.'

305
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:46,160
I got up and took a shower. I tried to wake up, 
tried to forget Scott's blood on the floor. The  

306
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:56,400
redness of it. I let the waterfall over my body. 
It was warm and it felt good. Scott was dead,  

307
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:06,160
but the water felt good. Ten minutes later Jeff 
arrived. I went down to Reception to see him.  

308
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
We sat by the fire.

309
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
'What is it?' I asked.

310
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,320
The young man looked at me. 'Well,  

311
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:24,560
maybe it's nothing, but...' he started. I 
could see that he really wanted to talk.

312
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,200
'Well,' I said, 'it's best to tell 
me if you think it's important.'

313
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,960
'It's about the notebook,' he said.

314
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,600
'The notebook?' I asked. 'Do you have it?'

315
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:49,920
'No,' he said. 'No, it's just that... Well, you 
know that Janine was studying to be a journalist?'

316
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,360
'Yes, like you,' I said.

317
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,840
'Well, I was thinking...' Jeff said.

318
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,120
'What is it?' I asked.

319
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,560
'The thing is,' he said, 'every year at 
our university we have a competition.'

320
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,080
'I don't understand,' I said.

321
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,800
'It's a competition for students of journalism,' 
he told me, 'in February. It's for the best story.  

322
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,840
You know something new... 
something that no one knows about.'

323
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,560
'And?' I asked.

324
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,040
'So the winner - the one who writes 
the best story - gets a big prize,'  

325
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,840
he said, 'and Janine really wanted to win.'

326
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,360
'And she was good.' I said.

327
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,680
'The best.' Jeff smiled. 'And she was 
working on something really big, I'm sure.'

328
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
'How do you know?' I asked.

329
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:03,280
'Well, I just know she was,' he said. 
'She was always writing in her notebook.  

330
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,280
I could see she was. It was something big. And 
I'm sure it was something about Pine Crest!'

331
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,520
'Why do you think that? About 
Pine Crest, I mean?' I asked.

332
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,840
'Well, you know she came here every year?'

333
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
'Yes,' I said.

334
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,480
'I watched her,' said Jeff. 
'Well, you know, we were friends.  

335
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,080
And she went to the library at least two 
afternoons in the last ten days, after skiing.  

336
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,400
For books. She was trying to put 
the story together. I'm sure of it!'

337
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,520
I thought about what he said. 'But she didn't show 
it to you?' I asked. 'Or talk to you about it?'

338
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,920
Jeff smiled. 'No!' he said. 
'I'm in the competition too.  

339
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,440
I don't know if it means anything... 
that the notebook is gone.'

340
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,040
'Well,' I smiled at him, 'it's something.'

341
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,840
I looked out of the window. The 
mountains were soft and quiet.

342
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,400
'Why didn't you say something 
before?' I asked him.

343
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,760
'I didn't think. I mean I didn't think 
it could have anything to do with it,'  

344
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,640
said the young man. 'But maybe it 
does. And now the notebook's gone.'

345
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:48,720
It was quiet for a moment. Then Jeff spoke. 'You 
know, Detective Laine,' he said, looking at me,  

346
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,600
'it's really terrible to 
lose someone close to you.  

347
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,840
I can't tell you how I feel. I feel terrible.'

348
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,400
'Yes,' I said. 'I know.'

349
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,640
I looked at Jeff. He looked so 
young and so sad. I don't know why,  

350
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:20,960
but I wanted to tell him about Scott. Perhaps 
it was because my dream was so close to me.  

351
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
Perhaps it was because Jeff had kind, blue eyes.  

352
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:35,360
Perhaps it was because Jeff's friend was dead 
too. I told him the story. The story about Scott.

353
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:44,480
'We never caught him,' I said. 'Eddie 
Lang, I mean. I never caught him.  

354
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,840
I knew it was him. I knew he killed Scott. But...'

355
00:39:51,760 --> 00:40:00,240
'But you didn't have anything... you couldn't 
show that it was him,' said Jeff. 'I understand.  

356
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,360
Yes, it's difficult.'

357
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,600
'Yeah,' I said, standing up.  

358
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,160
'Most days it's difficult, and some 
days are more difficult than others.'

359
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,400
'So...?' Jeff asked.

360
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,080
'So how do I live?' I asked 
the question for him. 'Well,  

361
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,120
some days I think why wasn't I 
there in front? Why didn't I die?  

362
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,600
Then some days I think why didn't I stop 
Lang, stop him from shooting Scott?'

363
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,640
Jeff looked at me.

364
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,480
'But most days,' I said, 'I think 
we're going to get Eddie Lang!  

365
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,480
One day, Eddie Lang will be in 
prison for a very long time!'
 
 
 

366
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,840
CHAPTER FIVE

367
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
Looking for reasons

368
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:16,720
That night at about nine-thirty Janine Anderson's 
parents flew into Denver International Airport.  

369
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,480
They were returning early from their holiday 
in Italy. A police car drove them to Pine Crest  

370
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,120
Hospital. They had to see their daughter's 
body, to see that it really was Janine.

371
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,440
The Andersons were staying at the Pine Lodge too,  

372
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,640
and late in the evening, at about eleven 
o'clock, Bill Gershon brought them to the hotel.  

373
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,120
'I'm so sorry,' I said to them. 
'I'll try to make this quick.'

374
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,840
Gene and Loretta Anderson were both forty 
to forty-five, well-dressed, rich Texans.  

375
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,240
Janine's mother soon went to her room and I talked 
to the father. Gene Anderson was a Texas oilman,  

376
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,080
a man who was now very rich, but who started 
life on a farm, a ranch, near Houston.

377
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,920
'I just can't believe it,' he said 
again and again. 'She was so young,  

378
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:30,320
so intelligent. Who did this, 
Detective Laine? Who killed my baby?'

379
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,520
'I don't know, Mr. Anderson,' I 
said, 'but I am going to find out.'

380
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,360
'I hope so, Detective Laine. I really hope so.'

381
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,320
'But I need your help, Mr. Anderson,' I said.

382
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,240
'Anything I can do,' he said.

383
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,720
'Well, there is one thing,' I said. 'She 
was studying to become a journalist, right?'

384
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:06,800
'That's right,' he said, 'and she was an 
"A" student.' He smiled for the first time.  

385
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,160
'She was a really good writer,' he said.  

386
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,880
'All her teachers said she could be 
a really good journalist one day.'

387
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,840
Gene Anderson tried to stop himself 
from crying. I waited for a few minutes.

388
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,600
'Mr. Anderson, Janine's friend 
Jeff told me that she was writing  

389
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,440
something for a university competition,' I said.

390
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,840
'Yes,' said the dead girl's father, 'and 
she really wanted to win. She wanted to  

391
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,160
be a journalist more than anything in the 
world. And she knew that it was a good start.  

392
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,760
She told me something about it at Christmas.'

393
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,680
'Did she tell you what she 
was writing about?' I asked.

394
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,080
'No, not really, ma'am,' said Gene Anderson, 
'but I think it was something big.'

395
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,520
I looked at Gene Anderson.

396
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,240
He went on: '"Daddy," she told me, "this 
story's so big it's going to get me the  

397
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,000
journalism prize and maybe somebody will 
go to prison for a very long time."'

398
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,160
'But she didn't tell you who the 
"somebody" was?' I asked him.

399
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:43,920
'No,' he said, 'she didn't. She was working 
on it, you know, getting it right. Hey,  

400
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,400
you're not saying...?'

401
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,000
'I'm not saying anything, Mr. 
Anderson,' I replied. 'Nothing at all.'

402
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:04,400
The next morning I got up early and went 
out. It was very cold in the early morning.  

403
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,960
The snow was hard and it was 
difficult to stay on your feet.

404
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:19,120
I thought again, about what Gene Anderson told me. 
'Somebody will go to prison for a very long time,'  

405
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:26,080
his daughter said to him. Who was 
it? What was Janine writing about?

406
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,520
I looked for Pine Crest Town Library, the library 
where Janine Anderson went to study for her story.  

407
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,600
Then I saw a building with a big sign outside. 
It said: 'Books can change your life.'

408
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:53,120
I went into the library. The young woman at the 
desk had big hair and a big smile. 'Good morning,  

409
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,760
can I help you?' she said.

410
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,520
'Yes,' I said, and showed her my 
police badge. 'Detective Flick Laine,  

411
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,200
Denver Police Department. It's 
about the death of Janine Anderson.'

412
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,360
She stopped smiling. 'Oh yes, 
poor girl... it's terrible.'

413
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,360
'Did she ever come here?' I asked.

414
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:29,520
'Yes, she did,' said the young woman. 'She mostly 
wanted to look at pages from old newspapers.'

415
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,640
'She could take books and 
newspapers away?' I asked.

416
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,000
'She had a letter from her 
university,' said the young woman,  

417
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,040
'so she could take newspapers and books 
out. She was a student, you know.'

418
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,080
'Yes,' I said. 'Do you have a list of 
the newspapers and books she took?'

419
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,200
'Oh yes,' said the librarian. 
'Would you like to see it?'

420
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,240
'Yes, please,' I said.

421
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:07,520
The young woman turned to the computer in 
front of her. 'Here,' she said. 'Have a look.'

422
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,680
First, there was the dead girl's 
name and home address in Texas.  

423
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,640
Then there was a list of books; all of them 
were about Colorado and land development.  

424
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,480
Then there was a list of about ten 
newspapers that Janine took from the  

425
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:33,760
library in the last two years. I asked 
to see them all. In every newspaper,  

426
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,520
there was a story about ski resorts and hotels. 
One of them talked about a famous movie star.

427
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:50,720
The movie star, Susan Hunter, who lives in Pine 
Crest, said: 'People have always come to Colorado,  

428
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:59,440
to get rich fast. In the past, it was gold and 
silver. Today, most of the gold and silver has  

429
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,840
gone. The new gold is land that can 
be used for ski resorts and hotels.  

430
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,960
Land developers make millions of dollars from 
this land. Today in Colorado, there's a fight  

431
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,560
between big business and nature lovers who 
want to stop this. I am fighting for Colorado!'

432
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:34,640
I closed the newspaper. Big business, I thought. 
Big money. Every year in Colorado, there were more  

433
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:42,960
houses, more stores, and more ski resorts. 
More and more people trying to make money.  

434
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:51,600
I knew that people who lived here in the Rocky 
Mountains often got angry. 'This is nature,'  

435
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,760
they said. 'We don't need more buildings. 
We don't need more ski resorts.'  

436
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:15,840
But it was like standing on the beach 
and trying to make the sea go back.
 
 
 

437
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,440
CHAPTER SIX

438
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,600
A Movie Star

439
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,440
I called Gershon on my cell phone.

440
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,120
'Susan Hunter,' I said. 'She seems to be very 
active in the fight against land development.'

441
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:54,640
'Yeah, she was, he said. 'But she 
hasn't done anything for a while.'

442
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,080
'Where does she live?' I asked.

443
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,080
'Big house up on Hillside,' he said.  

444
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,200
Hillside was the part of Pine Crest 
where all the famous people lived.

445
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,600
'Good,' I said. 'I'll go to see her. 
Oh, and did you hear from the hospital?'

446
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,560
'Yes,' he said.

447
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,840
'And?' I asked. Working with Gershon was slow.

448
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:33,120
'Well, they are sure now that it was 
murder,' he said, 'and it was a man.'

449
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,280
'What time did she die?' I asked.

450
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,680
'Between ten-thirty and eleven,' he said.

451
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:49,600
Janine Anderson died minutes before Teresa 
Douglas went to the pool and found her body.  

452
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,280
And probably minutes after the 
waiters at the Columbine left.

453
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,040
I put my phone away and felt 
my gun in my inside pocket.

454
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,080
At three o'clock that afternoon, I parked my Chevy  

455
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:13,920
next to Susan Hunter's Jaguar, outside 
her beautiful big house. Movie stars,  

456
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,240
I thought. They don't like development, 
but they live in big houses!

457
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:28,560
I got out of my car and looked at the mountains. 
I saw that there were cameras everywhere around  

458
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:36,480
the house. A very tall man came to the door. I 
could see that he had a gun under his jacket.

459
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,720
I showed him my City of Denver police badge.

460
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,000
'Good afternoon, Detective 
Laine,' he said, smiling.

461
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,880
He took me into the star's living room. 
A few moments later, she walked in.

462
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,880
Susan Hunter was a beautiful woman in her 
thirties, with black hair and clear blue eyes.  

463
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:08,240
She was dressed in grey trousers and a red 
blouse with a high neck. We sat together in  

464
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:15,120
the very big living room, drinking tea. Around 
the room, there were photos of the star with  

465
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:20,800
other famous movie stars. There were also 
photos of her husband and three children.

466
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,480
'Yes, in the past it was gold and 
silver, Detective Laine,' she said,  

467
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:37,120
taking a drink of her tea. 'Now it's ski resorts. 
There's always some reason why we need land.'

468
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,520
I waited for more.

469
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:49,200
'But,' she said, 'it can't go on like this. 
The land is not ours. It's for our children  

470
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,480
and our grandchildren to enjoy. 
This is such a beautiful place.'

471
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:03,600
'Yes, it's lovely,' I agreed. We looked out 
of the window. The sun was starting to go down  

472
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,760
over the Rocky Mountains and 
the sky was pink and orange.

473
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:15,840
'But ski resorts mean big money,' she went 
on, 'and it's difficult to stop people buying  

474
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:24,320
and developing the land.' Her voice became 
very quiet. 'Look at Redridge,' she said.

475
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:33,680
'Oh yes,' I said. Redridge was a small town 
thirty miles away. It was an old silver town.

476
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:42,320
'Well,' she said, 'three years ago 
Redridge was a small, quiet town.  

477
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:48,160
Now it's a very big resort with hotels, 
expensive stores and restaurants,  

478
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,120
and ski runs everywhere. It has 
thousands of visitors every year.'

479
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,760
'So?' I asked. 'Isn't that good for the town?'

480
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,840
Susan Hunter laughed. 'Have 
you seen it?' she asked.

481
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,040
'Tell me more,' I said.

482
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,400
'The Government Land Office,' she said, 
'bought the Redridge land fifty years ago.  

483
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,560
Then, in 1997, they - the GLO - wanted to sell the  

484
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,520
land. They knew they could sell it as a 
vacation resort and get a lot of money.'

485
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,280
I knew that this happened a lot. The government 
was always trying to find ways to make money.  

486
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:41,120
Susan Hunter went on: 'So they asked 
vacation resort companies to tell them  

487
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:47,840
about their plans for the town. There were five 
big companies that wanted to develop Redridge.  

488
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:55,200
The company that won was Alpine Resorts. 
Their boss is a guy called Ricky Klein.'

489
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,720
'Ricky Klein?' I asked.

490
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:07,120
'He's always in the newspapers,' she said. 'He's 
very rich and he has hundreds of businesses.  

491
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,800
Alpine Resorts was already 
famous for Alpine Resorts  

492
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:20,800
Oregon, which destroyed beautiful natural 
forests. Three of the other four companies  

493
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:27,600
all had good plans for Redridge. They wanted 
to save its natural beauty,' she went on.

494
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,840
'So why did the GLO choose 
the worst plan?' I asked.

495
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,320
'Ha! That's the big question, Detective Laine,'  

496
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:45,840
said Susan Hunter. 'I guess that Ricky Klein 
gave someone in the GLO a lot of money.'

497
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,120
'Money? A bribe?' I asked.

498
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,600
Susan Hunter nodded. 'A bribe,' she 
said. 'Millions of dollars, I guess.'

499
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,640
'And why wasn't it in the newspapers?' I 
asked. 'I mean, you knew about it... who else?'

500
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:17,840
'The GLO kept everything quiet until the last 
minute,' she said. 'Then it was too late.  

501
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:26,320
My group was called Save Colorado. We knew about 
the bribe from someone who worked for the GLO.  

502
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,840
But we don't know who took the bribe.'

503
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,400
I looked at her. 'Did you know 
Janine Anderson?' I asked.

504
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,440
'Yes, I did a little,' she said quietly.  

505
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,800
'She came here to talk to me last 
year. I told her what I knew.'

506
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,120
That's it, I thought. Janine Anderson  

507
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,840
found out the name of the person in the 
Government Land Office who took the money.

508
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,840
It was quiet for a few moments.

509
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,080
'And what about Pine Crest?' I asked.

510
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:14,480
'Well,' Susan Hunter said, 'the next Alpine 
Resorts development will be in Pine Crest,  

511
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,480
later this year. What happened 
to Redridge will happen here.  

512
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:27,440
They'll kill its natural beauty.' She 
smiled sadly. And no-one can save it.'

513
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:39,840
I stood up to go. At the door, I turned round. 
'There's one thing I don't understand,' I said.

514
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:48,160
'You mean why don't I do something about this? Why 
didn't I tell the police before now?' she asked.

515
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,920
She pulled down the neck of her red blouse.  

516
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:59,280
On her neck, very near her throat, 
there was a big scar. From a knife.

517
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,000
'Detective Laine, I have three children,  

518
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:10,320
a wonderful husband and my work,' 
she said. 'I don't want to die.'

519
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
'What happened?' I asked.

520
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,760
'It was a year ago. Oh, I can't say who it was,'  

521
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:27,920
she said. 'It happened at night and I didn't see 
his face. But I'm sure it was because of all this.  

522
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,200
These are dangerous days. 
We must be very careful.'

523
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,440
Yeah, dangerous days,  

524
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,840
I thought. I felt my gun under my jacket 
and left the movie star's house.
 
 
 

525
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:49,840
CHAPTER SEVEN

526
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,240
A visit to Redridge

527
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,680
I drove away from Susan Hunter's 
house and back to my hotel.  

528
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:05,840
I thought about my talk with the movie 
star. Ricky Klein of Alpine Resorts gave  

529
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:11,600
someone in the Government Land Office a 
bribe to take the worst plan for Redridge.  

530
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:19,040
And Janine Anderson knew all about it. But 
who was it, and how did Janine find out?

531
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,280
I went back to my room and called Gershon.

532
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,200
'Bill, I want a full list of people 
in the Government Land Office since  

533
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,760
1996. Can you ask one of 
your men to get it for me?'

534
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,280
'I guess so,' said Gershon.

535
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,000
Same old Gershon. What was wrong with the guy?

536
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,960
The next morning I woke up 
early. I picked up my gun.  

537
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,960
I remembered Susan Hunter's question 
about Redridge: 'Have you seen it?'

538
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,840
It was time to visit Redridge. 
I wanted to see it for myself.

539
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,360
I got in the Chevy and drove 
the thirty miles to the town.

540
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,880
'Welcome to Redridge, home 
of Alpine Resorts Colorado'  

541
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,840
said the sign as I drove in. The town 
was busy with people on vacation.  

542
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:22,720
Skiers, mostly. On Main Street, there were some 
stores and restaurants. Then, at the end of the  

543
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:30,320
street, I found the beginning of Alpine Resorts 
Colorado. At the gate was a man in a blue uniform.

544
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:38,320
'Good morning, how can I help you?' he 
asked. He smiled and showed very white teeth.

545
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:46,080
'Well,' I said, 'I'm just visiting, 
you know, and I'd like to take a look.'

546
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,840
'Of course,' he smiled. 'I'll 
ask someone to show you around.'

547
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,720
I waited. He talked to someone on the phone.  

548
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,840
A few minutes later, a young blonde woman 
walked up to me. She smiled a lot too.

549
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:12,800
'Good morning,' she said, shaking my hand. 
'My name is Tina Nielson from Alpine Resorts.  

550
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,880
Let me show you around our beautiful resort.'

551
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:24,800
We started walking. Alpine Resorts 
Colorado was almost like a small city.  

552
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,600
When you went through the big gate, there were 
a lot of different buildings. There were three  

553
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:41,280
swimming pools, four hotels, vacation homes, 
restaurants and ski rental. It was very, very big.

554
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:49,440
'We have the complete vacation here,' 
smiled Tina. 'You can do everything.  

555
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,800
You don't have to leave Alpine Resorts.'

556
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:00,240
I looked around. Many of the buildings were 
so big that you couldn't see the mountains.

557
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:06,400
'Yes,' she went on. 'It's a 
vacation for the whole family.  

558
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,960
And the skiing is very good. We have all 
the ski runs in Redridge right here.'

559
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,840
'You mean,' I said, 'if I want 
to ski I have to stay here?'

560
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,840
'Well,' she said, 'of course 
you can ski just for the day.  

561
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,800
But the ski runs are ours. 
I mean Alpine Resorts'.'

562
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,880
'And how much is a ski pass?' I asked.

563
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,640
'It's three hundred dollars a day,' she said.

564
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,360
Three hundred dollars! That was double 
the cost of a ski pass in Pine Crest.  

565
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:51,680
Alpine Resorts was very expensive; 
someone was making a lot of money!

566
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,520
'But why don't you try it?' she said.

567
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,880
'Well, I'm a little busy...' I started.

568
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,720
'Come on,' she said. 'We'll be happy to give 
you a half price ski pass for the morning.  

569
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,000
That will be just seventy-five dollars.'

570
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:19,520
'Well, OK,' I said. I could ski for an hour or 
two, I thought. I needed some time to think.

571
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:28,960
I went to the ski rental, and got some skis, boots 
and poles. I went up the mountain on a ski lift  

572
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,600
and spent an hour or two skiing the lower runs. 
It was a beautiful day to be on the mountains.  

573
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,920
But from the top I could see how 
big Alpine Resorts really was.

574
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:50,640
At about eleven-thirty, I went into a cafe 
halfway up the mountain. There were a lot of  

575
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:58,640
other skiers there. I drank my coffee, took my 
ski run map out of my pocket and looked at it.  

576
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:07,440
Up above the cafe there were some difficult, 
'black' runs with interesting names like Mad Dog  

577
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:15,680
and Killer Run. I wanted to try them. And I wanted 
to get away from the people. I needed to think.

578
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,360
I took the Mountain Tops ski 
lift up another 1,000 feet.  

579
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:31,520
Here, at 10,500 feet, the world was 
white and quiet. It was very cold. There  

580
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:39,840
were almost no people, just a few figures 
far away. Most skiers stayed down below.  

581
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:47,680
I felt alone. I put my hand in the pocket 
on the inside of my coat and felt my gun.

582
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:56,240
I wanted to go up even higher, to 12,000 
feet, almost to the top of the mountain.  

583
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:05,120
I started to walk slowly to the Summit ski 
lift. Suddenly, I heard somebody behind me.

584
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,640
'Detective Laine,' said a man's voice.

585
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,240
I turned around. The man was 
wearing a black ski mask.  

586
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,840
I couldn't see his face. Just his brown eyes.

587
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,240
I moved away from the man quickly. But the 
man came closer to me and said in my ear:  

588
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:37,360
'Turn around, Detective. We're going to get on the 
ski lift together.' I felt something hard in my  

589
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:46,320
back. It felt like a gun. There were no people, 
anywhere. Just the man with the gun and me.

590
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,320
'And don't do anything stupid,' 
he said, 'or I'll kill you.'
 
 
 

591
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,720
CHAPTER EIGHT

592
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,960
Dangerous Days

593
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,680
'You can't do this,' I said to the man.

594
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:13,040
'Be quiet and get on the ski 
lift,' the man said. He pushed me.

595
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,720
The ski lift had a seat for two people.  

596
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,600
The man pushed me into the seat 
and then he got in next to me.  

597
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:31,840
I looked around, but there was nobody up here. The 
ski lift went up. Up to the top of the mountain.

598
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:40,880
I looked at the man, at his brown eyes. He 
was slim. Was he the man at the Columbine?

599
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,400
'Give me your gun,' he said.

600
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,520
'My gun?' I said.

601
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,320
'Come on,' he said. 'I know 
you're carrying a gun.'

602
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,160
I looked down. We were thirty feet over the snow.

603
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,480
'And don't do anything stupid,' he said.

604
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:10,480
I put my hand inside my coat and felt my 
gun. I took it out and gave it to him.

605
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,880
'And now,' said the man, putting my gun 
in his pocket, 'you're going to fall...  

606
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:27,840
you're going to fall from the ski lift.' 
'You're crazy!' I said. 'They'll catch you.'

607
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:38,240
'I'll just say that you fell,' he said. Anyway, 
I don't know you, and you don't know me, do you?'

608
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:48,240
I thought fast. 'I know you work for Ricky 
Klein,' I said, taking a chance. I needed  

609
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:56,480
time and I wanted him to talk. The man 
looked at me. 'You're smart,' he said.

610
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,960
'And Janine Anderson?' I 
asked. 'Did you kill her?'

611
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:11,360
'We had to,' he said. 'She knew too 
much. She asked too many questions.  

612
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,000
And she was very stupid. She 
wanted to tell everyone about it.'

613
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,840
'How did you know that she was alone 
in the swimming pool?' I asked.

614
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,920
'I watched her,' he said, 'watched her for days.'

615
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,560
'From the Columbine restaurant,' I said.

616
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:41,520
'Yes, she often went to the pool 
alone in the evenings. It was easy.  

617
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:52,080
I just went into the hotel through the parking 
lot.' Yes, I thought. It couldn't be easier.

618
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,960
'And then you took her notebook?' I asked.

619
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:01,760
'Do you think I'm crazy? Of course, 
I took her notebook. I burned it.'

620
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,320
I didn't want him to stop.

621
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:11,920
'And she knew the name of the man in the 
Government Land Office?' I asked quickly.  

622
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:19,840
'The man who took a bribe from Ricky Klein 
to let him build Alpine Resorts Colorado?'

623
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,800
'Yes, Detective,' he said, 'the Big Boss, Big CJ.'

624
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,160
'Big CJ? Who's that?' I asked.

625
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:38,960
'Enough questions,' said the man. 
'I just do the killing, Detective.'

626
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:50,640
I looked down. We were very high. The snow and 
the trees were a long way down. I could see two  

627
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:58,720
skiers on the mountain but they were very far 
away. I couldn't shout. I couldn't do anything.

628
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:05,680
'You're next, Detective 
Laine,' he said. 'Time to die.'

629
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,880
I looked down again. It was a long 
way down and he was trying to push me.  

630
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
I had to do something and I had to do it now.

631
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:25,520
The gunman moved to lift up the bar on the ski 
lift. Quickly, I moved forward and hit him in  

632
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:33,360
his face with my right hand. At the same time, I 
hit his hand with the gun in it with my left hand.  

633
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:41,360
The gun flew out of his hand and fell. It made 
no noise as it fell into the snow far below.

634
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,280
'You...' he started, 'you...'  

635
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:57,840
But it was too late. I hit him on the back of his 
head, pushed him and he fell. Down, down, down.

636
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:04,160
I looked down and watched him. His 
skis were heavy and he fell fast.  

637
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:16,360
He fell into the trees far down below. I pulled 
down the bar. The ski lift went on moving. Up, up.  

638
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,840
It was quiet again. The only thing I 
could hear was the sound of my heart.
 
 
 

639
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,120
CHAPTER NINE

640
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,040
A lot to lose

641
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,840
'Whisky, please,' I said to Bill Gershon.

642
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:46,320
I sat down. It was nine o'clock that evening. 
We were in his office. I needed a drink.  

643
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,520
Gershon took the whisky from 
his cupboard. I smiled at him.  

644
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,160
'Just like Leo,' I said. 'Do all Chiefs 
of Police have whisky in their cupboards?'

645
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,760
Gershon smiled and put the whisky down 
on the little table in front of me.

646
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:12,640
I took a drink of the whisky. It was 
good. I looked at Gershon. I was alive.

647
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,920
'Tony Rizzo,' I said to Gershon, 
'what did you find out about him?'

648
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:28,320
The only thing I knew about the gunman was his 
name. The police found his body in the snow.  

649
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,120
Tony Rizzo was the name on the 
driver's license in his pocket.

650
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:41,680
'Tony Rizzo came from New Mexico,' said Gershon. 
'He was a hit man for anybody who paid him.'

651
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:49,840
A hit man. A killer. And Ricky Klein 
had enough money to pay him, I thought.

652
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:56,640
Gershon went on: 'He spent four 
years in prison near Santa Fe,  

653
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:03,840
New Mexico, from 1993 to 1997 
for killing a security guard.'

654
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,920
'Only four years?' I asked.

655
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,880
'He got out,' Gershon said. 
'His friends helped him.  

656
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,960
He jumped out of a window and onto a 
furniture truck.' I looked at Gershon.  

657
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:26,080
He was almost enjoying himself, I thought. 
Well, it was different from parking tickets.

658
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,840
'Anyway,' I said, 'I got everything from him.'

659
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,760
'The whole story?' asked Gershon.

660
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,480
'Well, almost everything,' I said. 
'I got Rizzo to talk on the ski lift.  

661
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,920
He killed Janine Anderson. And 
Ricky Klein was behind it.'

662
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,080
'Wow!' said Gershon. 'You're good!'

663
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,280
I smiled. 'That's the nicest 
thing you've said to me, Bill,'  

664
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,200
I said. Gershon looked at me and smiled. 
Maybe we were becoming friends at last.

665
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:12,480
'But there's someone else,' I went on. 
'Someone Rizzo called the "Big Boss,  

666
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:21,440
Big CJ". Janine Anderson knew a lot. 
Everything, I think. About Klein,  

667
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,400
how he gave a lot of money to this Big CJ. This 
man who was in the Government Land Office.'

668
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:35,600
'Government Land Office!' said Bill 
Gershon suddenly. He put his hand in  

669
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:42,320
his pocket and took out about five pieces 
of paper. 'I forgot! Here are the names.'

670
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,760
I took the papers from Gershon and 
put them on the table in front of me.  

671
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,600
I read through them. I was 
looking for a famous name.

672
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:02,400
A few minutes later, I looked up at Gershon. 
'Bill, there's one name on here that...'

673
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,880
'Yes, I know,' said Gershon.  

674
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:15,040
His eyes were big and round. 'Governor 
Clark Johnson... a member of the GLO!'

675
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,240
'But it can't be!' I said.

676
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,400
Clark Johnson! CJ!  

677
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:30,400
The Governor of Colorado. And the man who everyone 
said was the next President of the United States.

678
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:40,240
I drank my whisky. Now I could see everything. 
'Janine Anderson had enough to send Klein to  

679
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:46,080
prison for twenty years,' I said to 
Bill, 'and she had enough to finish  

680
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:52,720
Governor Johnson. She wanted to write 
all about it. Of course she had to die.'

681
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,520
'But how did Janine know about Clark Johnson?'

682
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,160
'Maybe she guessed at first,' I said.  

683
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,360
'She knew that it must be someone important in 
the GLO. Someone who needed a lot of money.'

684
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,440
'Wow!' said Gershon. 'If this is true, it's big!'

685
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:24,400
'Yes,' I said, 'it's big. Johnson was in 
the Government Land Office when Klein built  

686
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:34,000
Alpine Resorts Colorado in Redridge. Johnson 
needed money. He wanted to become Governor.'

687
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,240
'So Klein said, "You let me build 
Alpine Resorts..."' said Gershon.

688
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,160
'"And I'll give you money!" A lot of money.  

689
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:50,080
Millions of dollars, probably,' I said. 'We 
can look at his bank account easily enough.'

690
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,600
'And then Johnson wanted to 
become President!' said Gershon.

691
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:03,840
'Yes,' I said. 'I think Janine really 
did have a big story. The biggest.'

692
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,920
The 'next President of the 
United States' took money  

693
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,800
from Ricky Klein to let Klein build a new 
Alpine Resorts. What was bigger than that?

694
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:24,160
'But now we've got enough to send Klein 
to prison for a very long time,' I said.  

695
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,360
'And I think we can get Clark Johnson too.'

696
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,320
'Wow!' said Bill.

697
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,480
'Yes,' I said. 'Wow!'
 
 
 

698
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:40,800
CHAPTER TEN

699
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,840
The Big Boss

700
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,920
'That's the story,' I said to Jeff Mason.

701
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:57,840
Jeff now knew everything about Alpine Resorts and 
Ricky Klein. And about Governor Clark Johnson.

702
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:04,880
'So that's why poor Janine died!' 
he said. 'Because of Clark Johnson!'

703
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,160
'Yes, and now we need to get Johnson,' I said.

704
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,120
'What about Klein?' asked Jeff.

705
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:21,040
'We can't find him,' I said. 'He knows 
about Rizzo and he's gone - the police  

706
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:28,560
are still looking for him. We're going to get 
Johnson,' I went on, 'and I need your help.'

707
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:38,240
An hour later, Jeff called Johnson's office. I 
listened to the conversation on another phone.  

708
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,200
'I want to speak to Governor Johnson,' said Jeff.

709
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,680
'I'm sorry, but the Governor is busy 
now,' said a young woman. 'Can I help?'

710
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:58,560
'Yes,' said Jeff. 'You can tell the Governor that 
I want to talk about my friend Janine Anderson  

711
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,080
and the money Governor Johnson 
took from Mr. Ricky Klein.'  

712
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:08,160
Jeff gave the woman his hotel 
name and his telephone number.

713
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:16,320
Now we just had to wait. We had to wait for 
Johnson's new hit man. Tony Rizzo was dead,  

714
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:24,800
but I was sure that Clark Johnson had another hit 
man. Another killer. We waited in Jeff's room.  

715
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:34,080
It was dark. Jeff was on the bed. Two of Gershon's 
men waited near the window. They had their guns.

716
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,440
I was behind the door with my gun.  

717
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:45,120
We waited one hour, two hours. It was 
late at night and the hotel was quiet.

718
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,600
Then I heard a noise outside the door. 
Somebody was trying to get in. The door  

719
01:19:53,600 --> 01:20:00,560
opened and I could see a man. I moved 
fast from behind the door. Then I hit him  

720
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:07,280
over the back of his head with my gun. He 
fell to the floor like a tree. He didn't move.

721
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:14,560
I turned on the light. Gershon's men came 
out with their guns and stood around him.  

722
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,680
One of them took the hit man's gun from his 
hand. Jeff got up from the bed and came over.

723
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:29,680
I looked at the man on the floor. He was 
wearing black clothes and he had a black  

724
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:35,200
ski mask over his head. I took it 
off and looked at the man's face.

725
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:45,840
I turned cold. I couldn't speak. Jeff 
looked at me. 'Do you know him?' he asked.

726
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:54,560
'Yes,' I said quietly. 'It's Eddie 
Lang. The man who killed Scott.'

727
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:03,760
'Tell me about Governor Clark Johnson,' I 
said to Eddie Lang. 'He's behind this, right?'

728
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:13,840
Eddie Lang looked up and saw all the 
police around him. 'Yes,' he said.

729
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,200
The next day, I was in Gershon's office.

730
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,240
'We've found Klein,' he said. 
'He's told us everything.'  

731
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:31,520
Bill Gershon smiled at me. 'Thanks, Flick,' 
he said. 'Thanks for everything. I'm sorry...'

732
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,280
'Forget it,' I said, smiling.

733
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:43,200
I said goodbye to Gershon and the others - to 
Jeff and Teresa, and to Janine Anderson's parents.

734
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,800
'Thank you,' said Gene Anderson.  

735
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:55,840
'Thank you so much.' Then I got in my red Chevy 
and drove out of Pine Crest and onto the highway.  

736
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:03,280
I looked back at the beautiful Rocky Mountains. 
The mountains were white and the sky was blue.  

737
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:13,120
Life was almost good. Janine Anderson's killer was 
dead. Ricky Klein was going to prison for twenty  

738
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:21,040
years and Alpine Resorts was finished. Better 
than that, Clark Johnson, Governor of Colorado,  

739
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,920
was finished too. He could never be 
President of the United States now.

740
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:35,920
I thought about Scott. I could feel him smiling 
at me. 'Good work, Flick,' I could hear him say.

741
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:44,960
And, perhaps best of all, I thought, Eddie 
Lang was going to prison for a very long  

742
01:22:44,960 --> 01:23:05,840
time! Yes, life was good. I was in 
my red Chevy and life was good.
 
 
 
 

743
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,669
- THE END -
