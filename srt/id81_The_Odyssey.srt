CHAPTER ONE
An Island without a King

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:11,010
''If you prefer to destroy my property, then
stay.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:20,270
But I will ask Zeus for a day of judgement,
and on that day I will destroy you.'

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:29,180
Odysseus's unlucky fate is causing me great
sadness,' said the goddess Athene to her father,

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,000
the great god Zeus.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,170
'It is now twenty years since he has seen
his home and loving family.

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:46,700
Zeus, Father, King of Kings, why are you doing
nothing to help this man?'

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,040
'I have not forgotten the great hero Odysseus,
my child,' replied Zeus.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,949
'You are right - his troubles have continued
long enough.

10
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,950
We should bring him home.'

11
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,240
'Thank you, Father,' said bright-eyed Athene.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:15,359
'First I will go to Odysseus's palace and
talk to his son, young Telemachus.

13
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,590
I must make him ready for his father's return.'

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:28,119
Athene put on her shoes of gold, which carried
her as fast as the wind down from Mount Olympus,

15
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,909
over land and sea, to the island of Ithaca.

16
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:41,890
As she arrived at Odysseus's palace, she disguised
herself as a man called Mentes, a family friend

17
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,989
of Odysseus.

18
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:51,240
Outside the house she found a group of men
playing a noisy game while servants were busy

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,599
around them.

20
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,969
Some of the servants were mixing wine and
water in bowls; others were piling meat onto

21
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,640
plates and preparing the tables for dinner.

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:14,620
Odysseus's son, Telemachus, was sitting unhappily
among the men, dreaming of his father's return.

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:23,819
Telemachus saw Athene in her disguise, and
felt ashamed that no one was greeting the

24
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,819
visitor.

25
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,799
He hurried towards her.

26
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,230
'Welcome, friend!' he said.

27
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,629
'Come and have some food.

28
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,790
Then you can tell us why you are here.'

29
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:43,170
He led Athene to a table away from the other
men, worried that his visitor would be upset

30
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,650
by their noise and rudeness.

31
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:53,459
A servant poured water into a fine silver
bowl so they could wash their hands.

32
00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:04,810
Then plates of bread and meat were brought,
and their gold cups were filled with wine.

33
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:12,510
The other men also ate well, then called for
a song from the bard Phemius.

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:20,620
As Phemius began, Telemachus said to his guest,
'Those men over there worry about nothing

35
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,969
except music.

36
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:30,160
They have an easy life, living free while
another man pays!

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,269
If Odysseus returned now, they would wish
for a faster pair of legs, not gold or fine

38
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:39,680
clothes.

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,239
But unfortunately that will never happen.

40
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,480
My father was once the king of this island,
but now his bones are probably being washed

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,040
by the rain in a faraway land, or by the salt
sea waves.

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,870
No one can give us any news of him.

43
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:08,400
But tell me, what is your name, and what is
the reason for your visit?'

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,560
'My name is Mentes,' answered bright-eyed
Athene.

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,810
'My family and yours have been friends for
many years.

46
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,690
I am here because I heard that your father
had already arrived home.

47
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:33,030
The gods must be making his journey difficult,
but I am sure that he is still alive.

48
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,620
He is a resourceful man; he will think of
a way to get home.

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,440
But are you really Odysseus's son?

50
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,020
You have grown so tall!

51
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,210
You certainly have your father's eyes - although
I have not seen him for twenty years, since

52
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,610
he left to fight in the Trojan War.'

53
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:03,740
'Sometimes I wish I had a different father,
who was growing old in his own home,' Telemachus

54
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,849
replied.

55
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:09,530
'Odysseus is the most unfortunate man that
has ever lived.'

56
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:16,160
'He is lucky, at least, in his choice of wife,
the loving Penelope.

57
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,400
But tell me, what are you celebrating with
this special meal?

58
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,419
And who are these men, who bring no food but
behave like the owners of the house?

59
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,470
I have never seen such impolite guests.'

60
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:42,060
'My friend,' Telemachus replied, 'these men
have a meal like this every day of the year.

61
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,540
My father's disappearance has brought disaster
to this house.

62
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:54,450
Many great heroes died in the Trojan War,
but their sons are lucky.

63
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,590
Their fathers left them a famous name.

64
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:06,470
Odysseus was still alive at the end of the
war, but he has left me only tears.

65
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:13,590
These men have come from Ithaca and neighbouring
lands, hoping to marry my mother.

66
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,599
She does not want to accept any of her suitors.

67
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,650
But with no news of my father, she cannot
refuse them all.

68
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:31,090
They wait for her answer, eating and drinking
until we are nearly ruined.'

69
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,139
'How terrible!'

70
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,800
the goddess replied.

71
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,440
'They will die if your father ever finds them
here.

72
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,990
But while he is away, you must try to change
the situation yourself.

73
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,919
Here is my advice.

74
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:57,509
Choose your best ship, hire a crew of twenty
strong oarsmen, and go in search of news of

75
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,110
your father.

76
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,740
Someone may be able to tell you about him.

77
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:10,250
Go to Pylos first and question its king, wise
Nestor.

78
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,820
Then continue to King Menelaus in Sparta,
since he was the last of the Greeks to reach

79
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,039
home.

80
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:26,650
If you hear that your father is alive, prepare
yourself for another year with the suitors.

81
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,230
But if you hear that he is dead, give your
mother in marriage to another man and end

82
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,410
the suitors' stay in your house.

83
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,370
You are not a child now.

84
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:46,789
Act like a man, and your grandchildren's grandchildren
will celebrate your name.

85
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,110
But it is getting late.

86
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,260
I must return to my ship or my crew will start
to worry.

87
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,259
Think about my advice.'

88
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:03,759
'Thank you, good Mentes,' Telemachus said
warmly.

89
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,979
'You have shown me the kindness of a father
to his son.

90
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,090
But will you not stay a little longer?

91
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,810
Have a bath and relax.

92
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:20,969
Then you can go back to your ship with a gift
from my house - something beautiful and valuable,

93
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,539
as you have proved to be a good friend.'

94
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,120
'No,' replied Athene.

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:35,900
'I am in a hurry to get back to my ship and
reach my destination, the port of Temesa.

96
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,540
But I will be glad to accept a gift on my
way home.'

97
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:50,100
When she had finished speaking, the goddess
disappeared suddenly, like a bird through

98
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,280
a hole in the roof.

99
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,580
Telemachus was left feeling braver and more
resourceful than before.

100
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,620
Noticing this change, he realised that a god
had been with him.

101
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,570
His mind was filled with thoughts of his father
as he rejoined the suitors.

102
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,410
He found them listening in silence to Phemius,
who was singing about the Greeks' problems

103
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,560
on their return from the Trojan War.

104
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,260
In her rooms upstairs, Penelope could hear
the bard too.

105
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,190
She came down the stairs with tears in her
eyes.

106
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:43,100
'Phemius,' she said, 'you know so many wonderful
songs about great heroes and powerful gods.

107
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,120
Choose one of those songs for tonight, and
let the men here drink their wine in peace.

108
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,410
But give us no more of your present song.

109
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,690
It always makes me cry.

110
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:03,820
In the events of your story, no one lost a
dearer or a better husband than I, whose husband

111
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,320
is famous in every corner of Greece.'

112
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
But wise young Telemachus interrupted Penelope.

113
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,770
'Mother,' he said, 'do not stop our great
bard from entertaining us as he chooses.

114
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:26,350
The gods are responsible for our fates, not
the songs of a bard.

115
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,400
It is not surprising that Phemius has chosen
this story, as the newest songs are always

116
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,470
the most popular.

117
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,270
Go back to your rooms, Mother, and busy yourself
with your work.

118
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:49,660
I am the master of this house, so leave decisions
about the entertainment here to me.'

119
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,360
Penelope was surprised by her son's words,
but she knew that he spoke wisely.

120
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,920
She returned to her rooms, and there she lay
crying for Odysseus until the goddess Athene

121
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,050
closed her eyes in sleep.

122
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,000
Back in the hall, the suitors were shouting
and joking about their hopes to marry the

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,660
beautiful lady of the house.

124
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,680
Telemachus stood up and spoke to them.

125
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,020
'Gentlemen,' he said, 'this is not the way
for suitors to behave.

126
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,100
Stop this rudeness!

127
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,970
Let us enjoy the food and the song - Phemius
has the voice of a god.

128
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,230
But tomorrow morning there is going to be
a meeting.

129
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,210
I am going to make a formal request that you
leave my house.

130
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,890
After tonight, eat your meals somewhere else.

131
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,200
If you prefer to destroy my property, then
stay.

132
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:05,980
But I will ask Zeus for a day of judgement,
and on that day I will destroy you.'

133
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,580
The suitors were shocked by Telemachus's new
confidence.

134
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,490
For a moment they did not know what to say.

135
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,700
Then Antinous spoke.

136
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:23,250
'Are the gods teaching you this arrogance,
Telemachus?

137
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:30,190
If you are already so arrogant now, I hope
you never become king of Ithaca.'

138
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:38,040
'I will gladly become king if the gods wish
it,' replied Telemachus.

139
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,850
'But many other princes in Greece want that
title and they are welcome to it, since my

140
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,540
father is dead.

141
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:55,970
I just want to be the master of my own house,
and of the servants won by my father in war.'

142
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,850
Eurymachus now spoke.

143
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,200
'You are right, Telemachus.

144
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,940
The gods must decide who Ithaca's next king
will be.

145
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,110
And you should keep your own property and
rule your own house.

146
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,320
But tell us, who was your guest and where
was he from?

147
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,490
Did he bring news of your father, or was he
here on business of his own?

148
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,060
He left so quickly that we had no opportunity
to meet him.'

149
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,880
'There is never any news of my father.

150
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,430
We must accept that he is not coming back.

151
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,180
My guest was Mentes, an old friend of my father.'

152
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:55,360
Telemachus did not tell them what he knew
in his heart - that Mentes was a god in disguise.

153
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,980
The rest of the evening was spent dancing
and listening to music.

154
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,950
When it grew dark, the suitors slowly returned
to their own homes.

155
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,260
In his bedroom, Telemachus lay awake all night,
thinking about Athene's advice.

156
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:21,550
The 
next morning, he called the people of Ithaca

157
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,560
to a meeting.

158
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,320
When everyone was ready, Telemachus walked
to the meeting-place with only two dogs as

159
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,350
companions.

160
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:38,640
He looked so proud and confident that everyone's
eyes turned to him in admiration.

161
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,040
The older men moved away so that he could
take his father's seat.

162
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,880
Telemachus stood to address the people.

163
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,500
'I called this meeting, gentlemen, to ask
for your help.

164
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,620
Great trouble has fallen on my house.

165
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,860
First, I have lost my father, Odysseus.

166
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,830
But worse than this, a second problem will
soon ruin me.

167
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:15,500
A group of suitors spend their days in our
house, eating our animals and drinking our

168
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,360
wine.

169
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,890
Soon all our property will be wasted.

170
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:29,570
Some of the suitors are from the families
of Ithaca - some are even here, among us now.

171
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,260
Tell them to leave my mother alone.

172
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,370
Or did you dislike my father Odysseus's treatment
of you, and think that our house deserves

173
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,530
these troubles?

174
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:47,960
I would gladly fight all the suitors if I
had the strength.

175
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,570
But I am one and they are many.

176
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,290
I cannot defend our house alone.'

177
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:04,190
As he spoke, his anger grew, and at the end
of his speech his eyes were wet with tears.

178
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,030
Many people felt sorry for Telemachus.

179
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,760
No one spoke - until Antinous broke the silence.

180
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,310
'What a speech, Telemachus!' he said.

181
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,910
'And what anger!

182
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:26,550
You blame me and the other suitors for your
troubles, but you are wrong.

183
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,890
The fault is not ours, but your own mother's.

184
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:37,870
For nearly four years she has made us wait
for her answer.

185
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,320
She gives each of us a reason to hope for
her hand in marriage.

186
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:51,530
She makes promises in private messages, but
she never keeps those promises.

187
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,870
And then there was that shroud.

188
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,330
"I need to finished it before I marry again,"
she told us.

189
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:06,910
"It is to cover the body of Odysseus's father,
Laertes, when he dies.

190
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:13,220
It would be bad for my reputation if such
a great lord had no shroud on his death."

191
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,179
We decided to be patient and agree to her
wishes.

192
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:27,770
She worked on the shroud every day, but at
night she undid all her work.

193
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,409
For three years she tricked us in this way.

194
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:39,929
In the end, one of her servants told us of
her dishonesty, and we forced her to complete

195
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,529
the shroud.

196
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:46,450
But still she has not chosen a husband.

197
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,500
This is the suitors' answer, Telemachus.

198
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:55,570
Tell your mother to stop her tricks.

199
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,559
We will not leave your house in peace until
she has made her choice and married one of

200
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,559
us.'

201
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:11,590
'I cannot force her to marry while she still
hopes for my father's return,' replied Telemachus.

202
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,350
'If I did that, the anger of the gods would
bring me even more disasters.

203
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,750
Go and eat your meals somewhere else.

204
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:30,779
If you stay, the gods will surely punish you
for your unlawful behavior.'

205
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:39,610
The great god Zeus was listening to his words
and sent two eagles to fly above the meeting-place.

206
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:46,150
In the sky, the birds attacked each other,
biting each other's faces and necks before

207
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,019
flying away over the town.

208
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:58,360
The people stared at the birds, asking themselves
what this sign from the gods meant.

209
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:05,690
Halitherses, a wise old man skilled in prophecy,
spoke first.

210
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:14,129
'People of Ithaca, and suitors too, hear my
words.

211
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:21,990
Odysseus will not be absent much longer, and
his return will bring a violent end to the

212
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,299
lives of these arrogant suitors.

213
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,240
This will be a disaster for many of us on
Ithaca.

214
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,340
We must stop the suitors before it is too
late.

215
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:43,750
Or even better, the suitors should stop their
bad behavior themselves.'

216
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,830
The suitor Eurymachus stood to reply.

217
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,909
'Go home, old man,' he laughed.

218
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:59,429
'Tell your stories to your children and leave
us to understand the signs of the gods.

219
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,470
But now I will make a prophecy.

220
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:12,999
If you say anything more about Odysseus's
return or disaster for the suitors, you yourself

221
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:16,170
will meet a violent end.

222
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:23,970
And this is my advice to Telemachus: he should
order his mother to choose a husband.

223
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,629
Until she does this, the suitors will never
leave.

224
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:37,240
We are afraid of no one - and certainly not
of Telemachus and his brave words.'

225
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,549
Mentor, an old friend of Odysseus, spoke now.

226
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:51,080
'People of Ithaca, do you care nothing for
Odysseus, who ruled you with the love of a

227
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,480
father?

228
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:01,220
Why should a king aim to be fair and kind
to his people, if this is your repayment?

229
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,309
The suitors are few and you are many.

230
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:12,399
But you sit here in silence and say nothing
to criticize their shocking behavior.'

231
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:18,669
The suitors shouted over Mentor's words, but
Telemachus silenced them.

232
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:26,029
'Eurymachus and you other suitors,' he said,
'I will say no more.

233
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:31,370
The gods and the people of Ithaca have heard
my request.

234
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,070
But now, I need a fast ship and a crew of
twenty strong men.

235
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,700
I am going to Pylos and Sparta to ask for
news of my father.

236
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,630
If I hear that he is alive, I will wait one
more year.

237
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:56,450
But if I hear that he is dead, I will give
my mother in marriage to a new husband.'

238
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:03,340
The suitors laughed at his plan, saying that
he would never even find a crew.

239
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,309
And so the meeting ended.

240
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,029
Telemachus went to the seashore to think.

241
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:21,500
Athene came to him there, this time disguised
as his father's Ithacan friend Mentor.

242
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,049
'Do not worry about the suitors,' she said.

243
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,980
'They are fools.

244
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:36,320
The resourceful son of a resourceful father
has nothing to fear from them.

245
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,870
I myself will be your companion on your journey.

246
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:49,420
Go back to your house and get food and wine,
while I find you a ship and a crew.'

247
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,769
Telemachus returned to his house, where he
found the suitors preparing for another great

248
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,769
dinner.

249
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:01,889
With a laugh, Antinous ran up to him.

250
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:04,960
'Come and eat with us,' he called.

251
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,440
'And later I will help you find a ship for
your journey.'

252
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:19,600
'I will make my own arrangements for a ship
- and for a nasty end for you suitors too,'

253
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,110
replied Telemachus.

254
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,750
Hearing this, all the suitors started shouting.

255
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,129
'He is planning to bring back an army from
Pylos to cut our throats!'

256
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,129
laughed one.

257
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:38,249
'Perhaps he will buy some poison to put in
our wine-bowl!'

258
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,500
cried another.

259
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,350
'Or he may get lost at sea like his father.

260
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,159
Oh, how sad that would be!

261
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,780
We would have so much trouble sharing his
property between us all!'

262
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,190
added a third.

263
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,210
Telemachus let them talk.

264
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,780
He went downstairs and unlocked a room full
of his father's treasure.

265
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,799
There were piles of gold and silver, clothes,
and jars of oil and wine.

266
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,740
Everything was being kept safe for Odysseus's
return by his loyal servant Eurycleia.

267
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:24,789
Odysseus's father, Laertes, had bought Eurycleia
when she was still a girl, for the price of

268
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,460
twenty cows.

269
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,769
She had looked after both Odysseus and Telemachus
when they were babies, and no one loved them

270
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,779
more than she did.

271
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:43,330
Calling the old woman now to the room, Telemachus
said, 'Please could you get twelve jars of

272
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,389
fine wine for me, and plenty of food?

273
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:49,530
But do not tell anyone!

274
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,830
I will come and collect it this evening, when
my mother has gone upstairs for the night.

275
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:01,570
I am going to Pylos and Sparta to ask for
news of my father.'

276
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:09,880
There were tears in Eurycleia's eyes as she
replied, 'Dear child, no!

277
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,460
The suitors will find a way to murder you
on your journey and share all this wealth

278
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,450
between them.

279
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,870
Stay here, at home with your mother, where
you belong.

280
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,519
Do not go looking for trouble on the stormy
seas.'

281
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,309
'Please do not worry, Eurycleia,' answered
Telemachus.

282
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,039
'I have the gods on my side.

283
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,619
But promise me that you will not tell my mother
that I have gone.

284
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:43,470
We do not want to upset her for no reason.'

285
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:49,480
Eurycleia promised to keep his secret and
started organising the food and drink.

286
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,149
Telemachus went back upstairs to the hall
and rejoined the suitors.

287
00:25:55,149 --> 00:26:02,310
At the same time, Athene was going round the
town disguised as Telemachus, choosing twenty

288
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,740
strong men for the ship's crew.

289
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,970
She had already borrowed a ship from an Ithacan
man called Noemon.

290
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,950
When the ship and crew were ready, she returned
to Odysseus's palace and made the suitors

291
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,669
sleepy.

292
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:25,210
They soon found that they could not keep their
eyes open, so one after the other they went

293
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,299
to bed.

294
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:33,820
Athene took on the appearance of Mentor again,
and went to find Telemachus.

295
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,679
'Come,' she said to him.

296
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,669
'Twenty companions are sitting at their oars,
waiting to start their journey.

297
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,769
Let us not delay.'

298
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:50,520
Telemachus followed Athene to the ship.

299
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,570
The food and wine was carried on board, and
soon they were at sea.

300
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:02,649
Athene called for a good wind to take them
to Pylos, and Telemachus ordered his men to

301
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,240
put up the sail.

302
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:16,999
As night turned to day, the ship was making
good progress on its way to Pylos.

303
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:20,380
CHAPTER TWO
Telemachus's Travels

304
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:29,019
'If Odysseus ever proved that he was your
friend in the hard years of the war, tell

305
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:34,150
me everything that you know about his death.'

306
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:40,340
As Telemachus and his companions came near
to Pylos, they saw a great crowd of people

307
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:46,280
on the beach, including King Nestor and his
family.

308
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,320
Telemachus's crew brought the ship to land.

309
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,659
Then they all followed Athene, who was still
disguised as Mentor, onto the shore.

310
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,850
Telemachus was the last to leave the ship.

311
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:10,860
As they walked towards the crowd, Athene said
to him, 'Remember, this is not a time to be

312
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
shy.

313
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,519
We are here to find out how your father's
life ended.

314
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:22,549
Go, then, and ask Nestor confidently if he
has any news.'

315
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:29,390
'But I will be embarrassed, talking in public
to Nestor,' Telemachus replied.

316
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,879
'He is so much older than me and so famous.

317
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,129
I have no experience of public life.

318
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:39,809
How should I speak to him?'

319
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,559
'Do not worry,' Athene advised.

320
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,410
'When your own words fail you, the gods will
help.

321
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,460
They are looking kindly on this journey of
yours.'

322
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:01,070
When they reached the crowd, they were greeted
warmly by Nestor and his family, who had just

323
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,179
made a sacrifice to the sea-god Poseidon.

324
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:14,179
The king's son, Peisistratus, offered them
some meat from the sacrificed cows, and servants

325
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,629
poured them some wine.

326
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:22,419
After they had finished the wonderful food,
Nestor spoke.

327
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:28,830
'Who are you, friends, and where have you
come from?

328
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,019
What is your business here in Pylos?'

329
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:37,630
Athene gave Telemachus the confidence to reply.

330
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:46,720
'Nestor, son of Neleus, great hero of the
Greeks, we are from the island of Ithaca.

331
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,260
I have come here looking for news of my father,
long-suffering Odysseus.

332
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:59,559
It is said that he fought by your side until
the end of the Trojan War.

333
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:05,770
But he has never come home, and no one can
tell us when or where he died.'

334
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:15,090
'Ah, my friend,' cried King Nestor, 'what
memories I have of that long war!

335
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:21,710
It would take years just to tell you of all
the disasters that struck us at Troy.

336
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:33,649
We lost our best men there - Achilles, Patroclus,
and my own son Antilochus too, a handsome

337
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:37,049
boy, fast and strong.

338
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:46,179
'For nine years we tried to beat the Trojans,
but Zeus threw many difficulties in our path.

339
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:55,019
In all those years, no one showed better judgment
than Odysseus - your father, if you really

340
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,370
are his son.

341
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:03,470
It is not hard to believe, since you look
and speak exactly like him.

342
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:09,739
In all those long years, your wise father
and I never once spoke on opposite sides of

343
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:11,789
an argument.

344
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:19,359
At every stage of the war, we agreed on the
best plan of action.

345
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,470
'After we destroyed the city of Troy, we left
in our ships.

346
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:31,639
But then Zeus sent us all in different directions,
because some people among us had displeased

347
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,109
the gods.

348
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:40,309
We had arguments about the route home, and
some ships were caught by storms.

349
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:46,020
I myself was lucky - my voyage was very smooth.

350
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,700
So I heard no news of the other commanders.'

351
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,400
'But what is the news from Ithaca?

352
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:00,279
Are the stories true, that a crowd of your
mother's suitors are living as uninvited guests

353
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,500
in your house?

354
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,020
I only wish that the goddess Athene showed
you some of the kindness that helped your

355
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,350
father so much during the war.

356
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,399
If she cared for you like that, the suitors
would soon have their thoughts of marriage

357
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,389
knocked out of them.'

358
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:26,710
'Good Nestor,' replied Telemachus, 'I cannot
hope for an end to my troubles with the suitors,

359
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,919
even if it is the gods' dearest wish.'

360
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:37,570
'Telemachus,' interrupted bright-eyed Athene,
'what are you saying?

361
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,669
Nothing is impossible if the gods are helping
you.'

362
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:49,289
'The gods have already sent my father to his
death, Mentor,' said Telemachus to the goddess.

363
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:53,370
'Is that their way of helping my family?'

364
00:32:53,370 --> 00:33:02,409
'Well, my advice to you, Telemachus,' continued
Nestor, 'is to go home quickly and guard your

365
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:05,899
property from the greedy suitors.

366
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:09,649
But there is one more person that you should
visit.

367
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:15,759
Menelaus has only just returned home, after
years lost at sea.

368
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,159
Perhaps he will have news of your father.

369
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:26,850
Go now, with your ship and crew; or my sons
can go with you by land, and show you the

370
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,950
way to red-haired Menelaus's palace in Sparta.'

371
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:39,799
Darkness was falling, so Nestor invited them
to stay the night at the palace.

372
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,739
'You are very kind, my lord,' said Athene.

373
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:51,230
'Telemachus will gladly accept your invitation,
but I must return to the ship.

374
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,840
In the morning the crew and I must continue
our voyage.

375
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:04,309
Telemachus can travel to Sparta in one of
your chariots, if your son can be his companion.'

376
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:09,480
When she finished, the goddess turned into
a bird and flew away.

377
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,890
Nestor and Telemachus stared at the sky in
shock.

378
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,320
'Telemachus, my boy!'

379
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:25,070
cried Nestor, 'I think your friend Mentor
was really Athene, whose help was so valuable

380
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,179
to your father.

381
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:33,230
With a goddess at your side, you have a great
future ahead of you!'

382
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:40,610
Telemachus spent the night in Nestor's palace,
and in the morning Nestor's son Peisistratus

383
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:47,450
called for a chariot to take them to Sparta.

384
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:53,870
They arrived two days later and found Menelaus
celebrating a family wedding.

385
00:34:53,870 --> 00:35:01,570
A bard and dancers were entertaining the guests
in the hall as they ate their dinner.

386
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,450
Telemachus and Peisistratus stopped their
chariot outside the palace.

387
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:14,740
Menelaus's friend Eteoneus came out of the
hall and saw them there.

388
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:20,170
He hurried to his king, saying, 'There are
two strangers at the gates.

389
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:25,970
Should we welcome them inside or ask them
to continue on their journey?'

390
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,920
Red-haired Menelaus answered him angrily.

391
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:38,460
'Eteoneus, you are not usually a fool, but
you are certainly talking like one now.

392
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,890
You and I enjoyed the welcome of strangers
in many far lands before we reached home.

393
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:50,800
Go and help our guests at once, and invite
them to join us.'

394
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,890
Telemachus and Peisistratus were soon following
Eteoneus into the palace, where they were

395
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:04,490
washed by the servant-girls and dressed in
fine new clothes.

396
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,110
Then they took their seats next to Menelaus
in the hall.

397
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:14,370
The servants brought them food and drink and
Menelaus greeted them warmly.

398
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:19,020
Telemachus whispered to Peisistratus, 'Look
at this room!

399
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,680
Have you ever seen so much gold?

400
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,200
Surely even Zeus's palace on Mount Olympus
does not shine as brightly!'

401
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,840
Menelaus heard his words and said, 'No one's
home can compare with the palace of the gods,

402
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,310
dear boy.

403
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:44,880
But few ordinary men have collected more treasure
than I have.

404
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,550
For seven long years I travelled the world
and made my fortune - in Cyprus, Egypt, Ethiopia

405
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,070
and Libya.

406
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:00,980
But there were many hard times during those
years, and while I was away, my brother was

407
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,520
cruelly murdered by his wife and her lover.

408
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,880
I would happily exchange all the gold and
silver in this house for the return of my

409
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,130
brother and the friends who I lost at Troy.

410
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:22,840
But although I miss every one of my lost companions,
there is one whose death upsets me even more

411
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,420
than the rest.

412
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:35,090
Odysseus always tried harder, fought harder,
thought harder than anyone else in the war.

413
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:39,160
But his resourcefulness did not help him in
the end.

414
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,230
He has never returned home.

415
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:49,980
I often think of his family - his father,
old Laertes, his loyal wife, Penelope, and

416
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:57,810
his son Telemachus, who was only a baby when
Odysseus left for the war.

417
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:02,790
It must be hard to wait for him year after
year.

418
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,920
They have probably given up waiting now.

419
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,650
It is twenty years since he was last in Ithaca.'

420
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:19,230
These words brought tears to Telemachus s
eyes, and Menelaus realized at once who his

421
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,430
young visitor must be.

422
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:29,360
As he was deciding what to say to him, his
wife Helen arrived in the hall.

423
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,920
Everyone's eyes followed her across the room
in admiration.

424
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,830
Long ago, her beauty had been the cause of
the Trojan War.

425
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,900
A Trojan prince, Paris, had stolen her from
her husband's home in Sparta and taken her

426
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,810
to live with him in Troy.

427
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,980
The Greeks had attacked the Trojans to win
her back.

428
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:01,510
Now, returned to her loving husband, her goddess-like
beauty still shone bright.

429
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:07,110
One of her ladies helped her into a chair;
another brought her a fine blanket of the

430
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:16,160
softest wool; a third passed her her silver
work-basket, a gift from a friend in Egypt.

431
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,130
As Helen started her work, she asked her husband
about the visitors.

432
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,000
'Do we know their names, Menelaus?

433
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,610
I must say, that young man looks exactly like
Odysseus.

434
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:36,960
Could he be Odysseus's son, who was only a
baby when the Greek army followed me to Troy?'

435
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,270
'I think you are right,' her husband replied.

436
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,290
'A few minutes ago he was crying when I spoke
of my memories of Odysseus.'

437
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,860
Peisistratus now spoke.

438
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,410
'Menelaus, great king, you have guessed rightly.

439
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:05,620
My friend here is Odysseus's son, Telemachus,
and I am Peisistratus, son of Nestor.

440
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,580
Because Telemachus is shy in the company of
great men like yourself, my father asked me

441
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,140
to be his companion here.'

442
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,840
'Well, he is a very welcome visitor,' cried
Menelaus.

443
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,330
'I had hoped to build his father a home near
mine, so that we could meet regularly and

444
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,370
continue to be friends.

445
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:35,190
But a jealous god has robbed me of this happy
future.'

446
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,260
Everyone's eyes filled with tears.

447
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:46,390
For some time they were silent, lost in their
own unhappy thoughts, until Peisistratus said,

448
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:52,560
'The dead deserve our tears, but this is meant
to be a wedding celebration.

449
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,460
Let us talk of happier subjects.'

450
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:01,050
'Wise words, Peisistratus,' replied Menelaus.

451
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,150
'You have your father's good sense.'

452
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:13,940
He called for more food and wine, and their
good humor slowly returned.

453
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,360
After a comfortable night in the palace, Telemachus
was woken by Menelaus.

454
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,860
'What is the purpose of your visit here, Telemachus?'

455
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
he asked.

456
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,300
'Is it public business or a private matter?'

457
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:35,400
'Great king, I came here to ask you for news
of my father.

458
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,460
My mother is surrounded by arrogant suitors,
who spend their days as uninvited guests in

459
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,630
my house.

460
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:50,040
They will not leave until my mother chooses
one of them, but she delays her choice as

461
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,740
she is still hoping for my father's return.

462
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:00,080
So the suitors wait in my hall, eating my
meat and drinking my wine until I am nearly

463
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,520
ruined.

464
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,540
I have come here to ask if you have any information
about my father.

465
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:13,520
Please, if Odysseus ever proved that he was
your friend in the hard years of the war,

466
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,770
tell me everything that you know about his
death.'

467
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:23,901
'I cannot believe that those cowardly suitors
are planning to take brave Odysseus's place

468
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,630
in Ithaca!

469
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,180
Ha!

470
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:34,500
They will get a shock if Odysseus ever returns
- and a quick death too.

471
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:41,041
But to answer your question, I will tell you
everything I heard from the god Proteus, whose

472
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,970
lips can never lie.

473
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,120
I was in Egypt.

474
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,750
For twenty days my companions and I had been
on an island in the mouth of the Nile with

475
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,770
no wind to take our ships home.

476
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:03,000
We had no more food and were starting to fear
for our lives.

477
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,640
But luckily the goddess Eidothee, Proteus's
daughter, saw us there and felt sorry for

478
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
us.

479
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,620
"My father, sea-loving Proteus, lives on this
island," she said.

480
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,350
"He can tell you how to get home.

481
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:26,560
He can also tell you what has happened in
Greece while you have been away."

482
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,320
"But how will I make your father tell me all
this?"

483
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,730
I asked her.

484
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,710
"Proteus does not give information willingly."'

485
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:43,220
'"When the sun is high in the sky, Proteus
comes out of the sea and sleeps on the beach

486
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,260
with the seals.

487
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,310
If you and a few companions dress in seal
skins, you can hide on the beach and surprise

488
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,370
him.

489
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,630
Hold him down with all your strength.

490
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:00,790
He will turn into all kinds of shapes as he
tries to escape you.

491
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:06,550
But if this fails, he will finally change
back to his normal shape.

492
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,310
Then you can let him go, and he will answer
all your questions."'

493
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:18,930
'The next day we did as Eidothee suggested.

494
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,420
At sunrise, she dug holes in the sand.

495
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:27,910
We climbed inside and she put seal skins over
our bodies.

496
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:33,640
There we waited, with the horrible smell of
dead seals in our noses.

497
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,840
Soon a great crowd of seals came out of the
sea and lay down around us on the beach, and

498
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,180
at midday Proteus joined them for a sleep.

499
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,800
With a shout, we jumped on him and held him
tightly.

500
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,530
Immediately he started turning into different
kinds of animal, then into water and into

501
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,880
a tree, but he could not escape us.

502
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,200
Finally he changed back into his normal shape,
and I said to him, "Are you going to change

503
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,330
shape all day, or will you tell us what we
need to know?

504
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:16,270
We have been unable to leave this island for
twenty days.

505
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,130
What can we do to get home?"'

506
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:27,170
'"You did not sacrifice to the gods before
you started your voyage," Proteus said, "so

507
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,960
now they are angry with you.

508
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,680
If you want to see your home again, you will
have to sail the waters of the Nile once more

509
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,140
and make the right sacrifices.

510
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,210
Then your voyage home can continue."'

511
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:51,120
'My heart was filled with sadness at the thought
of returning to the Egyptian mainland.

512
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,810
But I hid my feelings and said, "I will do
as you say.

513
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:00,890
But tell me, what news is there of the rest
of the Greek army?

514
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,290
Has everyone reached home safely?"'

515
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,800
'"Why, Menelaus, are you asking me this?

516
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,190
I warn you, you will cry an ocean of tears
when you hear my answer.

517
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:19,840
Most of the Greek commanders are now safe
in their homes, but two have died.

518
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:26,570
A third, though alive, is held prisoner on
an unknown island, far from his friends and

519
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,700
loving family."'

520
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:34,990
'"Ajax was the first to die, in a terrible
storm at Gyrae.

521
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:42,020
But your brother Agamemnon, who had been with
Ajax just before the storm, was lucky and

522
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,190
sailed from Gyrae with all his ships unharmed.

523
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,340
It seemed that he had escaped his rate.

524
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:58,460
When he landed safely in his homeland, Mycenae,
he kissed the earth in happiness.

525
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,340
His arrival, though, was watched by one of
Aegisthus's spies."'

526
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:11,250
'"While you and your brother were at Troy,
your cousin Aegisthus had turned his attention

527
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,920
to wife-stealing.

528
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,000
Your brother's wife, Clytemnestra, was his
prize.

529
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,010
At first she had listened to his words of
love with deaf ears, but before long she had

530
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,250
become his willing lover.

531
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:33,830
Now Aegisthus was waiting for Agamemnon's
return."'

532
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:37,180
He had already won the wife.

533
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:43,220
Next he was planning to murder the husband
and rule the great lands of Mycenae in his

534
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,220
place.

535
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:52,980
'"When Aegisthus heard the spy's news, he
sent soldiers to hide in Agamemnon's palace.

536
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,780
Then he went in his chariot to meet the king.

537
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:03,200
Your brother, never guessing Aegisthus's terrible
plans, came up with him from the coast and

538
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,190
they celebrated his return together.

539
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:15,950
Then Aegisthus killed him in his own palace,
as a man might sacrifice a cow to the gods.

540
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,250
Agamemnon's companions were murdered too.

541
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,670
There was not a single man left alive."'

542
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:31,040
'This was Proteus's story, and it broke my
heart.

543
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,100
I sat down on the sands and cried.

544
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:41,720
After some time, Proteus interrupted me, saying,
"You have cried long enough!

545
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,340
Waste no more time in tears.

546
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,740
Is it not better to do everything in your
power to reach home, so that you can punish

547
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,210
Aegisthus for his crime?"'

548
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,220
'These words made me feel a little better.

549
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,870
"You have described the fates of two Greek
commanders.

550
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:07,310
Who is the third, who is a prisoner on an
unknown island?

551
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:11,580
Please tell me his name, even if it brings
me more unhappiness."

552
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:17,550
'"The third is Odysseus," he replied.

553
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:24,760
"I saw him on the island of the goddess Calypso,
with tears running down his face.

554
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:32,470
His only desire is to return to Ithaca, but
Calypso is in love with him and does not want

555
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,850
him to leave.

556
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:40,440
Without her help, he is a prisoner on the
island - he has no ship or crew to carry him

557
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
home."

558
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,850
'The old man had nothing more to say.

559
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:55,370
Soon he sank back into the deep salt waters,
and I returned with my companions to the ships.

560
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:01,770
The next day, we sailed back to the Egyptian
mainland, and there we made the right sacrifices

561
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,770
to the gods.

562
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:10,300
We also built a great mound of earth, so that
the name of Agamemnon would live in that far

563
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:16,480
land forever.

564
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,240
In front of Odysseus's palace, the suitors
were sitting and joking as usual.

565
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,090
Noemon came to Antinous and handsome Eurymachus.

566
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:32,380
'Do you know when Telemachus is expected home
from Pylos?

567
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:38,390
He went in my ship, and I need it for a voyage
to my farm on Elis.'

568
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,150
'Pylos!'

569
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,350
cried Antinous.

570
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:47,250
'I thought he was up in the hills of Ithaca
with his pigs and his sheep.'

571
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:52,910
'Yes, we all thought that,' agreed Eurymachus.

572
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,210
'Noemon, tell us exactly what you know.

573
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:05,550
'He left several days ago, and his crew were
the best young men on Ithaca, after ourselves.

574
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:13,130
Mentor went as his captain - well, it looked
like Mentor on the ship, but in fact I saw

575
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,580
Mentor here on Ithaca yesterday.

576
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,800
Very strange!'

577
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,840
As Noemon walked away, Antinous and Eurymachus
called all the suitors together.

578
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,850
'Telemachus is in trouble now,' thundered
Antinous.

579
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:37,230
'We said that his voyage to Pylos would never
happen.

580
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:43,730
And he has already gone, taking the best men
on Ithaca with him!

581
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,450
There is only one way to answer this arrogance.

582
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:56,180
Give me a fast ship and a strong crew, and
I will wait for him in the water between Ithaca

583
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,150
and the Samian rocks.

584
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,980
His voyage to find his father is going to
end in blood.'

585
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:11,440
The other suitors agreed to this plan, and
asked Antinous to make all the arrangements.

586
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,550
The servant Medon heard their conversation
and ran to tell his queen.

587
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:25,650
When Penelope heard the news, her knees shook
and her eyes filled with tears.

588
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,060
'But why has my son gone?'

589
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,500
she asked Medon.

590
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:35,700
'Does he want his bones to join his father's,
washed by the salt sea waves?'

591
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:42,891
'I understand that he was looking for news
of his father, my lady,' replied Medon, leaving

592
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:46,370
the room quietly.

593
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,030
Penelope fell to the floor.

594
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:56,020
Her women-servants surrounded her as she cried,
'Is there any woman whose fate is crueler

595
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,010
than mine?

596
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:02,920
Zeus gave me a good husband, then took him
from me.

597
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,050
And now my son has been stolen away without
a word.

598
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,250
And you servants are cruel too.

599
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,710
You all knew of Telemachus's voyage, I am
sure.

600
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:22,920
Why did no one wake me from my bed as he went
to his ship, so that I could stop this foolish

601
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,170
adventure?'

602
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:33,670
'Dear lady,' replied old Eurycleia, 'I knew
all about his voyage, and I even gave him

603
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,150
the food that he needed for it.

604
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,040
But he made me promise that I would not tell
you.

605
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,000
He did not want to upset you unnecessarily.

606
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,190
Now, go and wash, and put on some fresh clothes.

607
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,010
Then pray to Athene.

608
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:00,240
Although the danger is great, the goddess
may be able to save him.'

609
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:07,550
While Penelope prayed to Athene, Antinous
and his crew prepared their ship.

610
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:14,630
As the sky grew dark, they left the shore
and sailed to Asteris, a little island between

611
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:18,940
Ithaca and the rocky coast of Samos.

612
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:26,380
There they waited for Telemachus's ship to
come into view.

613
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,030
CHAPTER THREE
Leaving Calypso

614
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:35,580
''Even well-built ships do not cross this
endless sea.

615
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:43,360
It would be mad to travel such a long distance
in a home-made raft.'

616
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:49,790
While Athene was helping young Telemachus,
Zeus sent his messenger Hermes to talk to

617
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,380
the goddess Calypso.

618
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:59,640
For many years, Odysseus had been an unwilling
guest on Calypso's island.

619
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,190
Outside Calypso's cave, Hermes stopped to
admire the beautiful scene.

620
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:14,190
A little stream ran between trees filled with
birdsong, and flowers and fruit grew everywhere.

621
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:24,230
A fire burned brightly at the cave's entrance,
and inside he could hear Calypso singing.

622
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:31,130
When she noticed the god entering her home,
she said, 'Hermes, you are welcome.

623
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:36,770
Come and have something to eat, and tell me
what brings you here.'

624
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:41,270
'I have been sent here by Zeus,' he replied.

625
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:48,820
'I had no wish to make this long journey - across
endless, empty sea, with no cities or people

626
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,910
on the way.

627
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:55,140
But no one can refuse the orders of Zeus.

628
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:03,200
This is Zeus's message: it is not Odysseus's
fate to end his days on your island, so send

629
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,190
him on his way without delay.

630
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:10,950
He must continue his voyage to Ithaca.'

631
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,590
Calypso's body shook with sadness.

632
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:17,370
'Zeus is so unfair.

633
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:22,160
He himself is allowed any number of human
girlfriends.

634
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:29,260
But if a goddess finds love with a human,
he ends her happiness immediately.

635
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:36,370
I saved Odysseus from death after his ship
was destroyed in a storm; I welcomed him here

636
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:45,210
on my island and looked after all his needs;
I even offered to turn him into a god.

637
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,580
But now Zeus orders me to let him go.

638
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:55,540
Well, I must do it - I have no choice.

639
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,450
But I have no boat to give him, and the voyage
is long.

640
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,030
I can only tell him the direction to take.'

641
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:12,320
'Then send him on his way at once and you
will not have to worry about Zeus's anger.'

642
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:18,210
With these words, Hermes started his journey
back to the palace of the gods.

643
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:22,580
Calypso went at once to look for Odysseus.

644
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:28,790
She found him sitting on the shore, crying
for his lost home as usual.

645
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:36,080
'Dry your tears,' she said to him, 'and waste
no more of your life on this island that brings

646
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,400
you no pleasure.

647
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,000
I am ready to help you leave.

648
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,020
Cut down some trees and make a raft.

649
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,900
I will give you food and drink for your voyage.

650
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:55,690
I will even give you a wind that will blow
you to Ithaca, if more powerful gods do not

651
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,530
stop me.'

652
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:03,440
'Even well-built ships do not cross this endless
sea,' he replied.

653
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,580
'It would be mad to travel such a long distance
in a home-made raft.

654
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,800
I will not do it.

655
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:18,010
Or can you give me your word that this is
not a trick to cause me more trouble?'

656
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,770
Calypso smiled and touched his face with her
hand.

657
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:27,220
'How can you think that I would trick you
like that?

658
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:39,400
By the earth and the sky and by death itself,
I promise you: I am just trying to help.'

659
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:45,190
After they had eaten together in the cave,
she said, 'So have you definitely decided

660
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,490
to leave?

661
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,960
Please think again.

662
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,830
I know you miss your wife Penelope, but you
will have so much pain and suffering before

663
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,760
you reach your homeland.

664
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,230
Is it not better to stay here with me?

665
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:08,270
A goddess is more beautiful than any human
wife, and with me you can escape death forever

666
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,170
by becoming a god.'

667
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,520
'Do not be angry with me, goddess,' he replied.

668
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:21,950
'Of course you are more beautiful than Penelope,
but I want nothing more than to return home

669
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,440
to my family.

670
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:29,080
And I stopped worrying about the dangers of
my journey long ago.

671
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,210
I have suffered so much already.

672
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:36,190
One more disaster means nothing to me now.'

673
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:44,000
When morning came, Calypso gave Odysseus some
tools and he started work on his raft.

674
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,940
After four days of hard work, the raft was
ready.

675
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:53,960
It had a cloth sail, and plenty of food and
drink on board.

676
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:01,520
A warm and gentle wind blew up at Calypso's
command, and with a happy heart Odysseus sailed

677
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,910
out to sea.

678
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:11,600
Keeping his eyes on the stars, he travelled
east for seventeen days without sleeping,

679
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:18,040
and on the eighteenth day the land of the
Phaeacians came into view.

680
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:26,880
But Poseidon, god of the sea, saw Odysseus
on his raft and the sight made him angry.

681
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,990
'It seems that the other gods have changed
their minds about Odysseus,' he said to himself.

682
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:42,040
'He has nearly reached the land of the Phaeacians,
where his suffering is going to end.

683
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:47,220
But I have not forgiven him for the harm he
did to my son.

684
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:55,100
It is not too late to send a little more trouble
in his direction.'

685
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,850
With those words, he covered both land and
sea with thick fog.

686
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:06,950
Then he called all the winds together to make
a violent storm, and enormous waves crashed

687
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,950
down on Odysseus's raft.

688
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:16,140
'Oh gods!' cried Odysseus, 'have you not finished
with me yet?

689
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:22,260
Calypso's prophecy is coming true - that I
will have more pain and suffering before I

690
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,170
reach my homeland.

691
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:28,320
How lucky were my companions who were killed
at Troy!

692
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:35,070
They died with their friends around them,
and their names live forever; I am going to

693
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:42,270
die in a sea storm, alone and forgotten.'

694
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:48,590
As he spoke, a wave the size of a mountain
thundered down on him and threw him off the

695
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,280
raft.

696
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,580
The waters closed over his head.

697
01:01:53,580 --> 01:02:01,530
His clothes - a gift from Calypso - were heavy
in the water, and made swimming difficult.

698
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:08,110
But at last he reached the air and coughed
out the salt water from his mouth.

699
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:15,310
With the last of his energy, he swam back
to the raft and threw himself on board.

700
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:24,310
He held on tightly, but the violent winds
drove him in every direction except to safety.

701
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:28,470
Then Poseidon sent another enormous wave towards
him.

702
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:35,030
For a second or two, it hung above his head,
then it crashed violently down on the raft,

703
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:39,560
throwing the wood in all directions.

704
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:48,600
Odysseus held onto a piece of wood, kicked
off his clothes and bravely started swimming.

705
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,290
Poseidon laughed when he saw this.

706
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:57,870
'It is a long way to the coast, Odysseus,
but swim there if you can.

707
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:01,060
I have had my fun with you.'

708
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:09,080
Athene now sent the south, east and west winds
back to bed.

709
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:15,800
She calmed the north wind so it could blow
Odysseus gently towards the land of the Phaeacians.

710
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,260
For two days and two nights he swam.

711
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:28,820
Time after time he thought he would die, but
on the third day, a wave lifted him a little

712
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,720
and he saw that land was near.

713
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,980
He felt like a child who learns that his father,
after suffering from a long and painful illness,

714
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,560
has been cured.

715
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:48,350
Odysseus felt a similar happiness when he
saw the welcome sight of hills and trees.

716
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:54,380
He swam more quickly in his excitement, until
he heard the thunder of the waves on the rocks

717
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,380
ahead.

718
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:02,600
Too late, he realized that there were no beaches
to land on, there were only sharp walls of

719
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,030
broken rock.

720
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:11,940
An enormous wave lifted him towards them,
and it looked like certain death.

721
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:19,090
But luckily he managed to save himself by
catching onto a rock with both hands.

722
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:25,410
The powerful waves soon pulled his hands away,
and he was back under water.

723
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:28,300
He kicked hard to reach the air.

724
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:36,640
Finally, he decided to swim further along
the shore, although he was already so tired.

725
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:43,690
At last Odysseus came to a more welcoming
coastline.

726
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:49,470
He found the mouth of a stream, and there
he landed safely.

727
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:54,480
He fell to the ground, too weak to move.

728
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,660
He lay there for some time, until he realized
that it was getting late.

729
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:05,780
With no clothes, he might freeze at night
if he stayed where he was.

730
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:13,100
But was he safer in the woods, where wild
animals might be looking for an easy supper?

731
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:18,740
After some thought, he chose the warmer ground
of the woods, and looked for a suitable place

732
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,400
to sleep.

733
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,790
He found two trees growing together so tightly
that their branches kept out the wind and

734
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,570
sun and rain.

735
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:36,490
Between these trees he lay down and covered
himself with a blanket of dry leaves.

736
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:45,090
For the first time in three weeks, he fell
asleep.

737
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:53,340
As Odysseus slept, Athene went to the palace
of Alcinous, the Phaeacian king.

738
01:05:53,340 --> 01:06:01,310
Alcinous had a young daughter called Nausicaa,
as tall and beautiful as a goddess.

739
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:08,090
Athene, disguised as one of Nauiscaa's friends,
went into her bedroom and whispered in her

740
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,290
ear as she slept in her soft bed.

741
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:17,250
'Nausicaa, why are you being so lazy?

742
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:23,390
You will need lots of fine clothes when you
are married, but all your clothes are lying

743
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,130
around the palace unwashed.

744
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:30,850
Let us go and wash them together in the morning.

745
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,040
We must hurry.

746
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:39,020
The young men from every good family in the
land want to marry you, and your father will

747
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:43,340
certainly choose a husband for you soon.'

748
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:51,090
Athene then returned to her home on Mount
Olympus, and a little later Nausicaa woke

749
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,350
up.

750
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:57,990
Remembering the strange dream that she had
had in the night, she immediately went to

751
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:00,340
find her father.

752
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:06,590
'Father, could I have one of the horses today,
and a vehicle to carry our dirty clothes to

753
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,500
the stream?

754
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:14,440
Your own clothes need washing, and my brothers
often ask for clean clothes to wear at their

755
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,740
dances.'

756
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:22,160
She did not talk about her own marriage - she
was too shy to discuss this matter with her

757
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,500
father.

758
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:29,200
But he understood completely and replied,
'The servants will bring you what you need,

759
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,160
my child.'

760
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,940
While the servants brought a vehicle and a
horse, Nausicaa rushed around the palace collecting

761
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:42,360
her family's finest and most colourful clothes.

762
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:48,600
Her mother packed her some food and wine for
the trip, and soon Nausicaa and a group of

763
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:55,090
her friends were on their way to the stream,
talking happily.

764
01:07:55,090 --> 01:08:01,280
There were some deep pools in the stream,
perfect for washing the clothes.

765
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,960
The girls threw them into the water by the
armful and started their work.

766
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,840
When everything was clean, they stretched
out the clothes on the beach.

767
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:17,230
Then they bathed in the stream and sat down
for some food while the sunshine dried the

768
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:21,279
clothes.

769
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:27,759
When they had finished their meal, they started
playing a ball game, and Nausicaa sang the

770
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,389
instructions.

771
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:37,350
She looked like a young goddess, more beautiful
than all the beautiful girls around her.

772
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:43,299
The girls' voices woke Odysseus and he got
out of his bed between the trees to see what

773
01:08:43,299 --> 01:08:45,079
was happening.

774
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:51,569
Luckily, he remembered that he was wearing
no clothes, and used some leaves to hide his

775
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:53,420
body.

776
01:08:53,420 --> 01:09:01,029
But he looked dirty and wild after his terrible
days at sea, like a dangerous animal mad with

777
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:02,849
hunger.

778
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:07,630
When the girls saw him, they screamed and
ran away.

779
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:10,859
Only Nausicaa stayed to face him.

780
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:16,670
Odysseus's first thought was to throw his
arms around the beautiful girl's knees and

781
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,940
ask her for help.

782
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,429
But he did not want to upset her by touching
her.

783
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:28,999
Instead, he kept his distance and said, 'Are
you a human or a goddess?

784
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:34,600
I cannot guess the answer, since I have never
seen such beauty.

785
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,170
If you have a human family, how lucky they
are!

786
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:43,619
What pleasure they must feel when you dance
in their company.

787
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:48,380
And luckiest of all is the man who takes you
home as his wife.

788
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,739
'Princess, I must ask you for help.

789
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:57,860
Yesterday I arrived on this shore, carried
here by the winds after three weeks on the

790
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,039
stormy seas.

791
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:05,659
My raft and my clothes are lost, and I know
no one in this land.

792
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,989
Pity me in my troubles.

793
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:11,420
Tell me, please, how do I reach your city?

794
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,690
And do you have anything that I can use for
clothes?'

795
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:21,929
'Sir,' she replied, 'you will be given everything
that you need.

796
01:10:21,929 --> 01:10:28,309
The king of this land is Alcinous, and I am
his daughter.

797
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:31,080
I will gladly show you the way to his palace.'

798
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,949
'I thank you with all my heart,' answered
Odysseus.

799
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:39,869
Nausicaa now called to her friends.

800
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:42,239
'Come back, girls.

801
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,380
There is nothing to fear.

802
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:50,699
This man is an unlucky voyager and we will
help him, since all strangers are protected

803
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:51,699
by Zeus.'

804
01:10:51,699 --> 01:10:58,409
Odysseus washed his salty skin in the stream,
while the girls looked for some clothes to

805
01:10:58,409 --> 01:11:00,349
give him.

806
01:11:00,349 --> 01:11:07,210
As he dressed, clean at last, Athene used
her powers to make him taller and stronger,

807
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,440
with thicker hair.

808
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:16,320
Nausicaa whispered to her friends, 'When I
first saw this man, I thought he was terribly

809
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:23,570
unattractive; now, though, he looks more like
the gods on Olympus.

810
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:27,090
How I would like a man like this as my husband!

811
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,340
Hurry, now, girls.

812
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,860
Take him something to eat and drink.'

813
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:36,440
Odysseus was very grateful for the food.

814
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,579
While he ate hungrily, the girls packed up
the washed clothes.

815
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:47,180
Then Nausicaa called to Odysseus, We are going
back to the city now.

816
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:52,880
I am sure you will understand when I ask you
to follow with my friends only as far as the

817
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,300
city gates.

818
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,949
Inside the city, I must be more careful of
my reputation.

819
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:05,409
You can imagine what people will say if they
see me with a handsome stranger.

820
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:10,840
They will guess that I have refused all the
men from local families and chosen a foreign

821
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:17,480
husband instead, or that a god has taken me
as his wife.

822
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,610
That kind of talk will not help me to find
a good husband when the time comes.

823
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:27,440
So, we will leave you at the entrance to the
city.

824
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:32,640
Give us time to return to the palace, then
join us there later.

825
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,969
In the city, look at no one and ask no questions.

826
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:43,679
My people are great sailors, thanks to Poseidon,
with the fastest ships in the world - but

827
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,900
they are not always good hosts.

828
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:52,420
When you enter the palace, look for my mother,
Queen Arete.

829
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:58,489
She usually sits next to my father in the
great hall and, as the daughter of the last

830
01:12:58,489 --> 01:13:04,639
king, she is as powerful and popular as King
Alcinous himself.

831
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:09,050
Throw your arms around her knees and ask for
her help.

832
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:15,840
If she feels pity for your situation, you
will soon see your homeland again.'

833
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,239
Odysseus willingly agreed to the plan.

834
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:24,820
At the entrance to the city, he waited while
the princess and her friends returned to the

835
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,199
palace.

836
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:32,530
Athene threw a magic fog over him so that
no one could see him as he walked through

837
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,999
the city.

838
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:40,449
When he reached the gates of the palace, he
was almost blinded by the shining sight that

839
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,050
met his eyes.

840
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:49,830
Hanging on silver posts were two great doors
of gold, and inside were hundreds of beautiful

841
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:54,010
works of art, also made of gold.

842
01:13:54,010 --> 01:14:00,790
Around the palace was a brightly coloured
garden full of tall fruit trees.

843
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:06,219
Still protected by Athene's magic fog, he
entered the palace.

844
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:14,980
He found the great hall and walked, unseen,
past a long table of Phaeacians eating dinner.

845
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:21,550
When he got to Queen Arete's seat, he threw
his arms round her knees and, at the same

846
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:26,650
moment, Athene lifted the fog from his shoulders.

847
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:32,909
Everyone in the room looked at him in shock.

848
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:35,880
CHAPTER FOUR
With the Phaeacians

849
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:41,480
'I can think of no better companion for my
daughter.

850
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:49,079
I would give you a house and great treasures
if you were willing to stay here as her husband.'

851
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:57,590
'Arete, great queen,' said Odysseus, 'I am
here to ask you and your royal husband for

852
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,639
help.

853
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:04,800
I pray that the gods give your family good
fortune and great happiness.

854
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:11,969
For myself, my dearest wish is to return to
my home across the seas, after all the disasters

855
01:15:11,969 --> 01:15:15,260
that I have suffered.'

856
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:20,530
No one spoke, and Odysseus sat down on the
floor by the fire.

857
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:26,940
At last, the silence was broken by an older
Phaeacian man named Echeneus.

858
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:33,140
'My king, it is not right to let this man
sit on the floor.

859
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:39,679
Offer him one of our silver chairs to sit
on, and ask the servants to bring him some

860
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,489
wine.

861
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:46,789
We should pray to Zeus, protector of strangers.'

862
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:53,770
Alcinous did as Echeneus suggested, giving
Odysseus the seat where his favourite son

863
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,059
usually sat.

864
01:15:57,059 --> 01:16:06,040
When Odysseus had had food and drink, Alcinous
said, 'Phaeacians, we have eaten well.

865
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,940
Now it is time for you to return to your homes
for the night.

866
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:17,190
In the morning, we will decide how to arrange
this stranger's safe return to his homeland.'

867
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:21,380
The Phaeacian guests left the room.

868
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:27,890
While the servants cleared the tables, Arete
looked more closely at Odysseus and recognised

869
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:30,889
the clothes that he was wearing.

870
01:16:30,889 --> 01:16:35,040
She herself had made them with her ladies'
help.

871
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,380
'Sir,' she said, 'who are you?

872
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,610
And who gave you those clothes?

873
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:46,380
Did you say that you have come here from across
the sea?'

874
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:52,719
'Great queen, it would be boring for you to
listen to all my troubles, as the gods have

875
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,329
sent me so many.

876
01:16:55,329 --> 01:16:57,820
But I will tell you this.

877
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:04,670
I have come from an island far out to sea,
the home of the goddess Calypso.

878
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:11,420
Before that, I was travelling with my companions,
but they all died when Zeus destroyed our

879
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,520
ship.

880
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:19,349
Only I managed to stay alive, by holding onto
a piece of the broken ship until the winds

881
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:22,190
blew me to Calypso's shore.

882
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:28,100
For seven years she tried to win my love,
and for all that time I was an unhappy prisoner

883
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,690
on her island.

884
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:33,280
But, finally, she allowed me to leave.

885
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:40,949
I made a raft and sailed safely until I caught
sight of the mountains here in Phaeacian lands.

886
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:47,120
But then Poseidon sent a storm to destroy
my raft, and I nearly lost my life many times

887
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,510
as I swam to your shore.

888
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:58,400
'I slept near the coast, and in the morning
I was woken by your daughter and her friends.

889
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:03,239
I asked her for help and she gave me these
clothes.

890
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:05,579
You should be proud of her.

891
01:18:05,579 --> 01:18:09,860
She has the beauty of a goddess, and the good
sense too.'

892
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:14,040
'She made one mistake,' said Alcinous.

893
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:17,719
'Why did she not bring you home with her friends?'

894
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:22,650
'Do not blame your daughter, great king,'
replied Odysseus.

895
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,739
'She wanted me to follow her.

896
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:30,870
It was my decision to stay behind, fearing
that you would not like a stranger as your

897
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,079
daughter's companion.'

898
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:38,840
'My friend, I can think of no better companion
for my daughter.

899
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:45,639
I would give you a house and great treasures
if you were willing to stay here as her husband.

900
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:50,110
But we will not keep you here by force.

901
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:53,090
Tomorrow you can make your voyage home.

902
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:59,010
It will only take a day - it does not matter
how far you are going.

903
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:03,840
You will soon learn why the Phaeacians have
such a good reputation as seamen.'

904
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:11,670
Odysseus's heart filled with happiness as
he heard Alcinous's words.

905
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:17,999
Arete showed him to the bed that the servants
had prepared for him, and he spent the night

906
01:19:17,999 --> 01:19:24,030
dreaming of a happy return to Ithaca.

907
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:31,659
In the morning, fifty-two young men were chosen
as the crew for the voyage to Odysseus's homeland.

908
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:38,320
They prepared their boat down at the port,
then came to the palace for a meal.

909
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:45,110
When they had eaten, Alcinous called for his
bard, Demodocus.

910
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:50,289
'Demodocus, the gods have given you a special
gift.

911
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:57,880
Your songs never fail to please our ears,
whatever subject you choose for your story.

912
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,989
Sing!'

913
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:05,760
Demodocus sang of the Trojan War, and the
argument between Odysseus and Achilles that

914
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,610
had started a great wave of disasters for
the Greeks.

915
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:17,070
As Odysseus listened to the bard's song, he
put his hands over his face and cried.

916
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:24,420
He tried to hide his tears from the Phaeacians,
but Alcinous noticed his sadness.

917
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:30,540
Not wishing to upset his guest, he stopped
Demodocus after a pause in the song.

918
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:35,659
'Good people, we have enjoyed the food and
the song.

919
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:45,789
Now let us go outside and show our guest that
the Phaeacians are also good sportsmen.'

920
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:49,699
Everyone followed Alcinous to the city's meeting-place.

921
01:20:49,699 --> 01:20:54,510
The finest young men in the land rushed forward
to show their skill.

922
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,750
First there was a running race.

923
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,769
A great cloud of dust followed the runners
around the course.

924
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:10,289
Euryalus was soon far ahead of the rest, and
won the race easily.

925
01:21:10,289 --> 01:21:17,449
Next came throwing, jumping and fighting competitions,
each had a different winner.

926
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:25,269
Alcinous's son Laodamas, who had won the fighting,
then went to Odysseus and said, 'Come, sir,

927
01:21:25,269 --> 01:21:27,659
and join our games.

928
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:34,000
Forget your troubles for a few minutes, since
you will soon be back in your homeland.

929
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,699
If you are good at sport, there is no better
way to make a famous name for yourself.'

930
01:21:39,699 --> 01:21:46,530
Odysseus replied, 'My heart is too full of
sadness to play in your games.

931
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:53,820
I have suffered disaster after disaster, and
now I can think of nothing except my voyage

932
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,599
home.'

933
01:21:55,599 --> 01:22:00,600
Euryalus, the winner of the running race,
joined them.

934
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,519
'We understand, sir,' he said.

935
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:08,229
'We were wrong to think that you might have
strength or speed.

936
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:14,999
You are more like a sea captain, worrying
about his business and his ship.

937
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:17,769
Clearly you are not a sportsman.'

938
01:22:17,769 --> 01:22:20,260
Odysseus gave him an angry look.

939
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:26,330
'You should be ashamed of yourself for that
insult,' he said angrily.

940
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:32,699
'Some men do not have the fortune of good
looks, but they win popularity with the people

941
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:36,289
for their fine intelligence and wise words.

942
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:44,829
Others - and you are one - are good-looking
but arrogant, with no good sense at all.

943
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:47,530
Your words have angered me.

944
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:56,780
I am not unskilled at sport, as you suggest,
but after years at war and on the stormy seas

945
01:22:56,780 --> 01:23:00,600
I am not as strong as I once was.

946
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,059
I will join your competition, though, if you
wish it.

947
01:23:05,059 --> 01:23:09,920
I will not listen to more of your insults.'

948
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,940
Odysseus jumped from his seat and picked up
a stone disk, much bigger than the ones that

949
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,030
the Phaeacians usually used.

950
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:23,670
Putting all his weight into the throw, he
sent the disk flying through the air.

951
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:28,690
It landed far beyond the throw that had won
the competition earlier.

952
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:34,749
Odysseus turned to the Phaeacians with a smile.

953
01:23:34,749 --> 01:23:39,239
'Now beat that if you can,' he said.

954
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:44,510
'But I will probably make an even longer throw
in a minute.

955
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:47,139
You said that you wanted a competition.

956
01:23:47,139 --> 01:23:52,840
Well, I am happy to beat you in a fight, or
with a bow and arrow.

957
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,699
I am confident that I can win at anything
except running.

958
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:05,519
I am weak after my days at sea, and a younger
man would probably be faster on his legs.'

959
01:24:05,519 --> 01:24:11,749
'My friend,' said King Alcinous, 'I do not
blame you for your anger.

960
01:24:11,749 --> 01:24:16,170
Euryalus was wrong to speak to you as he did.

961
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:19,159
But let us forget the games.

962
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:25,580
When you are at home with your wife and children,
I want you to tell them of our special Phaeacian

963
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,580
skills.

964
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:35,479
We are not the world's greatest fighters or
throwers, but we can run fast and we are excellent

965
01:24:35,479 --> 01:24:36,749
seamen.

966
01:24:36,749 --> 01:24:45,170
We are also very proud of the fine food, music
and dance at our dinners, and of our wonderful

967
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:48,410
hot baths and comfortable beds.

968
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:55,489
So come, forget the games, and let our dancers
perform for you.

969
01:24:55,489 --> 01:25:04,340
And later our bard Demodocus can entertain
us with his songs.'

970
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:10,739
For the rest of the afternoon, Odysseus watched
the traditional dances of the Phaeacians and

971
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:14,329
listened to Demodocus's stories of the gods.

972
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:21,989
The entertainment ended with a dance by two
of Alcinous's sons, Laodamas and Halius, in

973
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:27,360
which they threw a purple ball to each other
as they moved in time to the music.

974
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:33,079
'You are right to be proud of your dancers,'
Odysseus said to his host.

975
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:37,909
'I have never seen such a wonderful performance.'

976
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:40,920
His words pleased Alcinous.

977
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:48,869
'Phaeacians,' said the king, 'we must give
our guest suitable gifts to take home.

978
01:25:48,869 --> 01:25:55,469
I and the other twelve princes of the land
should each give him some fine clothes and

979
01:25:55,469 --> 01:25:58,260
a bar of gold.

980
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:06,880
And Euryalus should add his own gift too,
to apologise for his rudeness at the games.'

981
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,659
Everyone agreed with Alcinous's suggestion
and the gifts were organized at once.

982
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:19,719
Euryalus gave Odysseus a well-made sword,
saying, 'Sir, your visit has been a great

983
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:22,920
pleasure to the Phaeacian people.

984
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:28,110
If my words upset you, let the winds blow
them away.

985
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:33,320
I pray to the gods that you have a safe voyage
on our ship and a warm welcome when you reach

986
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,909
your home.'

987
01:26:34,909 --> 01:26:42,900
'Friend,' replied Odysseus, 'I thank you,
and pray that the gods give you a happy life.

988
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:48,969
Your words at the games are now forgotten.'

989
01:26:48,969 --> 01:26:54,579
Queen Arete packed the new clothes and the
gold in a chest, and added a gold cup from

990
01:26:54,579 --> 01:26:56,739
her husband.

991
01:26:56,739 --> 01:27:03,229
Then the servants poured Odysseus a hot bath
- and what a pleasure it was to lie in that

992
01:27:03,229 --> 01:27:07,710
bath, after his hard weeks at sea.

993
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:11,860
When he was dressed, he went back to the great
hall.

994
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:18,360
Nausicaa was standing at the entrance to the
hall, looking like a goddess.

995
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,400
She was filled with admiration when she saw
Odysseus.

996
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,249
'Good luck, my friend,' she said.

997
01:27:25,249 --> 01:27:29,670
'Think of me sometimes when you are safely
back home.

998
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:32,730
You would not be alive without me.'

999
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:41,340
'Princess Nausicaa,' replied Odysseus, 'I
pray that Zeus will soon let me see my home

1000
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,340
again.

1001
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:47,090
If he does, I will always remember you.'

1002
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:55,690
With these words, he entered the hall and
took his seat next to King Alcinous at dinner.

1003
01:27:55,690 --> 01:28:01,010
When he saw Demodocus arrive, he asked a servant
to take the bard a plate of meat.

1004
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:08,050
Demodocus accepted it with pleasure, and Odysseus
said, 'I have never heard music as beautiful

1005
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:13,909
as yours, Demodocus, and it is wonderful that
you know the story of the Greeks' actions

1006
01:28:13,909 --> 01:28:16,770
at Troy so well.

1007
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:21,659
Can you tell us now about another part of
the war, when the Greeks built their wooden

1008
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:23,300
horse?

1009
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:30,769
If you sing of this as it really happened,
I will tell the world of your God-given skill.'

1010
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:35,110
The bard was happy to take this story as his
subject.

1011
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:41,239
The wooden horse was, he sang, Odysseus's
idea for getting Greek soldiers inside the

1012
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:42,960
walls of Troy.

1013
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:51,969
An enormous, hollow horse was made and Odysseus
and some others hid inside.

1014
01:28:51,969 --> 01:28:57,860
Then the rest of the Greeks burnt their defenses
and sailed away from the coast, pretending

1015
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,260
that they had given up the war.

1016
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:06,769
When the Trojans saw the horse, they pulled
it through the gates of the city, but they

1017
01:29:06,769 --> 01:29:09,539
argued about what to do next.

1018
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:15,610
Some wanted to throw it off a hillside and
break it on the rocks below, but others wanted

1019
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:19,929
to keep it as a great gift to the gods.

1020
01:29:19,929 --> 01:29:24,630
In the end the horse was left untouched.

1021
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:30,639
That night, Odysseus and his friends climbed
out of the horse and opened the city gates

1022
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,760
to their army outside.

1023
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,820
Greek soldiers poured through the gates to
destroy the city.

1024
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:44,349
They ran through the steep streets leaving
death behind them, while Odysseus and Menelaus

1025
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:49,580
had the fight of their lives against the son
of the Trojan king.

1026
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:55,110
While the bard was singing, tears ran down
Odysseus's face.

1027
01:29:55,110 --> 01:30:01,679
When Alcinous noticed his guest's condition,
he said, 'Phaeacians, though Demodocus tells

1028
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:07,679
his story beautifully, it does not please
everyone in the room.

1029
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,520
Since we began our meal, our guest has been
crying bitterly.

1030
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:18,050
Let us stop the story now, so that he can
enjoy his last evening with us.

1031
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:21,499
We do not want to upset him.

1032
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:26,320
And sir, you should tell us now who you are.

1033
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,219
Where is your home?

1034
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:31,710
Our seamen will need to know where to take
you.

1035
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:35,619
And tell us about your life and your travels.

1036
01:30:35,619 --> 01:30:38,059
What places have you visited?

1037
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:40,440
What sights have you seen?

1038
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:47,610
And explain why our bard's stories of the
Trojan War cause you so much unhappiness.

1039
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:50,699
Did you know someone who died at Troy?

1040
01:30:50,699 --> 01:31:00,579
Did you lose a good friend, or someone from
your family?'

1041
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:05,590
CHAPTER FIVE
A Monster with One Eye

1042
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:12,610
'He jumped up, caught two of my companions
in his great hands, and knocked their heads

1043
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:16,389
against the stone floor of the cave.'

1044
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:25,690
'King Alcinous,' said Odysseus, 'I do not
know where to begin and end my story.

1045
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:30,330
The gods have put so many troubles in my path!

1046
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:34,080
But I shall start by giving you my name.

1047
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:40,440
Though my home is far from here, I want you
all to think of me as your friend.

1048
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:46,409
I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, and my home
is on Ithaca.

1049
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:54,670
'It is a rocky island, but there is no sweeter
sight for a man than his own country.

1050
01:31:54,670 --> 01:32:00,249
The whole world talks about my clever plans
during the Trojan War.

1051
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:04,739
But let me tell you about the disastrous voyage
that followed.'

1052
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:12,430
'From Troy, I sailed with my companions to
the city of the Cicones, who had fought for

1053
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:15,030
the Trojans in the war.

1054
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:19,289
We destroyed the city and killed most of the
men who lived there.

1055
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:25,010
We shared the women and the treasures from
the city between us, and then I told my men

1056
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:26,780
to leave.

1057
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:29,739
The fools refused.

1058
01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:35,300
There was still a lot of wine and meat in
the city, so they stayed there, filling their

1059
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,449
stomachs.

1060
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:42,460
This gave the Cicones time to get help from
other cities in the area, whose armies were

1061
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,519
larger and better trained.

1062
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:54,079
In the morning, they attacked us - as many
of them as the leaves and flowers in spring.

1063
01:32:54,079 --> 01:33:00,790
We held them back at first, but after a whole
day of fighting they broke our line.

1064
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:07,400
My men and I had to run to our ships in confusion,
with the enemy at our back.

1065
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,420
Six men from each of our twelve ships were
killed.

1066
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:15,440
The rest of us were lucky to escape alive.'

1067
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:22,550
'We sailed away as fast as we could, crying
for our lost companions.

1068
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:25,000
Soon there was more trouble.

1069
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:32,579
When we were nearly home, the winds carried
us in the wrong direction, past Cythera.

1070
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:39,190
For nine days we were chased across the waves
by those disastrous winds, and on the tenth

1071
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:44,280
day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters.

1072
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:50,110
We got out of the ships, collected fresh water
for the next part of our voyage, and had a

1073
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,690
quick meal on the beach.

1074
01:33:52,690 --> 01:34:00,460
Then I sent three of my companions to find
out what sort of people lived in this land.

1075
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:05,290
'The men soon met the Lotus-eaters.

1076
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:12,639
Luckily, they were peaceful people who liked
to share their lotus fruit with strangers.

1077
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:20,760
There was just one problem - if you ate this
sweet fruit, you forgot all thoughts of home.

1078
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:27,619
Immediately, my companions had no wish to
return to the ships and bring us news.

1079
01:34:27,619 --> 01:34:34,639
They only wanted to stay with the Lotus-eaters
and eat lotus fruit all day.

1080
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:38,659
In the end, I had to use force to bring them
back.

1081
01:34:38,659 --> 01:34:43,860
Tears ran down their faces as I tied them
onto the ship and ordered the other men to

1082
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:50,070
continue the voyage home.

1083
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:53,429
'Next we came to the land of the Cyclopes.

1084
01:34:53,429 --> 01:35:01,019
They are rough, lawless people, one-eyed and
much taller than normal men.

1085
01:35:01,019 --> 01:35:07,019
They have no form of government, but live
with their families and their sheep in caves

1086
01:35:07,019 --> 01:35:12,369
in the mountains, paying no attention to their
neighbours.

1087
01:35:12,369 --> 01:35:17,400
They live on good farm land, but they do not
grow food on it.

1088
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:22,790
They have no ships, either, so know nothing
of the outside world.

1089
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:30,900
'We landed on an island not far from the Cyclopes's
coast and had a look around.

1090
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:36,769
No one lived on the island, but there were
plenty of animals and fruit for food, and

1091
01:35:36,769 --> 01:35:39,289
a fresh-water stream.

1092
01:35:39,289 --> 01:35:43,670
It was a perfect place to rest from our voyage.

1093
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:49,239
Some of the men went hunting, and soon there
was meat cooking on the fires.'

1094
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:57,219
'All day we ate, washing down the food with
red wine that we had taken from the Cicones.

1095
01:35:57,219 --> 01:36:01,190
We looked across the sea to the land of the
Cyclopes.

1096
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:06,760
We could see the smoke from their fires, and
could even hear them calling to their sheep.'

1097
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,050
'The next morning, I called the men together.

1098
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:18,180
"My friends," I said, "I am going to take
my ship to find out what kind of people live

1099
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,959
in that land over there.

1100
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:25,369
The rest of you, stay here and wait for our
return."'

1101
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:33,639
'My crew sat at their oars and it was not
long before we had crossed to the mainland.

1102
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:40,670
As we were making the ship safe on the beach,
we noticed a cave close to the sea.

1103
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:51,690
It had a very tall entrance, and an area outside
surrounded by a great wall of stones and branches.

1104
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:57,230
I chose my twelve best men to come with me,
and told the rest of my loyal companions to

1105
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,869
guard the ship.

1106
01:36:58,869 --> 01:37:04,640
I filled a large wineskin with the finest
wine from the ship.

1107
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:11,369
It had been a present from one of the Cicones,
a servant of the god Apollo, whose family

1108
01:37:11,369 --> 01:37:15,650
I had protected during our attack on his city.

1109
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:18,229
It was a wonderful drink.

1110
01:37:18,229 --> 01:37:24,260
The servant had kept it secret for many years,
and when he drank it he mixed one cupful of

1111
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:29,679
wine with twenty cupful's of water.

1112
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:35,270
The smell of the wine was heavenly, and no
one could refuse a drink of it.

1113
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:41,469
I brought this wine with me, and some food,
because I had a strange feeling that the people

1114
01:37:41,469 --> 01:37:45,330
in this land were not going to be welcoming
hosts.

1115
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:50,530
'It did not take us long to reach the cave.

1116
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:56,360
Its owner was not at home, so we went inside
and looked around.

1117
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:03,300
There were enormous baskets of cheese, wooden
buckets full of milk, and sheep organized

1118
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:10,140
into different age groups - new-born babies
in one area, spring-born in another, and summer-born

1119
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,400
in a third.

1120
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:19,619
My men suggested taking some cheese and sheep
to the ship and sailing away quickly.

1121
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:26,770
Although this was good advice, I decided instead
to wait for the owner of the cave to return.

1122
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:29,929
I was hoping for some gifts from our host.

1123
01:38:29,929 --> 01:38:36,630
'We lit a fire, ate some cheese, and sat down
to wait.

1124
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:41,840
At last, the cave's owner arrived.

1125
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:49,079
He was a great monster, more like a mountain
than a man, and had one big eye in the middle

1126
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:51,530
of his face.

1127
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:57,550
He was carrying an enormous pile of dry wood
for the fire, which he threw down on the ground

1128
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:02,190
inside the cave with a great crash.

1129
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:07,710
We were so frightened by the noise that we
ran to the back of the cave.

1130
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:11,369
He had been out on the hills with the adult
sheep.

1131
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:17,559
Now he drove some of the sheep into the cave
for milking, and left the others in the walled

1132
01:39:17,559 --> 01:39:20,409
area outside.

1133
01:39:20,409 --> 01:39:27,309
Then he closed the entrance with an enormous
stone, too big for twenty horses to pull.

1134
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:32,340
He milked his sheep, then put each mother
with her young.

1135
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:39,690
He used some of the milk for cheese, and left
the rest in a bucket to drink with supper.

1136
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:43,670
When he had finished his work, he lit the
fire again.

1137
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:47,599
That was the moment when he saw us.

1138
01:39:47,599 --> 01:39:50,479
'"Strangers!" he cried.

1139
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:52,920
"Who are you?

1140
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,210
Where are you from?

1141
01:39:54,210 --> 01:40:01,590
And why have you come to these shores?"

1142
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:11,610
'The man's monstrous body and deep, loud voice
filled us with terror, but I managed to find

1143
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,300
the words to reply.

1144
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:18,610
"We are Greeks," I said, "on our way back
from Troy.

1145
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:25,239
The winds drove us in the wrong direction
- as the gods intended, I suppose.

1146
01:40:25,239 --> 01:40:30,989
We are proud to say that we fought with great
Agamemnon in the Trojan War.

1147
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:34,380
But now we are asking for your help.

1148
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:41,570
We are hoping that you can welcome us as your
guests, and perhaps even give us some gifts.

1149
01:40:41,570 --> 01:40:47,030
Remember your duty to Zeus, who is the protector
of travellers in need of a friendly welcome."

1150
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:58,239
"'Stranger, you must be a fool, or from very
far from here, if you think that I care about

1151
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:01,969
Zeus and the other gods.

1152
01:41:01,969 --> 01:41:06,659
We Cyclopes are much stronger than the gods.

1153
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:15,199
I will only be kind to you and your men if
it suits me, not out of fear of Zeus's punishments.

1154
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:20,429
But tell me, where did you leave your ship?

1155
01:41:20,429 --> 01:41:24,479
Was it near here, or further along the coast?"

1156
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:31,510
'His question was intended to trick me, but
I am not a fool.

1157
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:34,199
I quickly thought of a story to tell him.

1158
01:41:34,199 --> 01:41:38,699
"Our ship was destroyed in a storm off your
coast.

1159
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:41,820
It is in pieces on the rocks north of here.

1160
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:46,920
Luckily, I and my friends here escaped alive."

1161
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,420
The cruel monster did not reply.

1162
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:56,010
Instead, he jumped up, caught two of my companions
in his great hands, and knocked their heads

1163
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:58,510
against the stone floor of the cave.

1164
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:06,230
He ate their legs first, then their arms,
then the rest of them, even the bones, until

1165
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:09,289
there was nothing left.

1166
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:14,539
We watched in shock, praying to Zeus for pity.

1167
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:19,389
When the Cyclops had finished his meal and
washed it down with milk, he stretched out

1168
01:42:19,389 --> 01:42:22,710
next to his sheep for a sleep.

1169
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:28,820
I felt for my sword, planning to kill him
as he slept.

1170
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:34,630
But then I saw the heavy stone in the entrance
and realized that without his strength we

1171
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:37,840
could never get out of the cave.

1172
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,349
So we waited fearfully for morning.

1173
01:42:42,349 --> 01:42:48,739
When he woke, the Cyclops lit the fire again
and milked his sheep.

1174
01:42:48,739 --> 01:42:52,960
Then he took two more of my men and ate them
greedily.

1175
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:58,670
Finally, he pushed the stone away from the
entrance without difficulty, drove the adult

1176
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:02,900
sheep out of the cave, and replaced the stone.

1177
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:13,979
As he went with the sheep to find grass, I
was left in the cave with murder in my heart.

1178
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:16,639
This was my plan.

1179
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,219
In the cave there was an enormous stick.

1180
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:26,380
The Cyclops sometimes carried it when he was
out walking, but it was big enough to support

1181
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,690
the sail of a good-sized ship.

1182
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:35,409
I cut off part of this stick and gave it a
sharp point at the end.

1183
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:40,269
Then my men and I held it over the fire to
make it hard.

1184
01:43:40,269 --> 01:43:45,229
When it was ready, we hid it at the back of
the cave.

1185
01:43:45,229 --> 01:43:50,440
Then I chose four men to help me when the
Cyclops returned.

1186
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:57,269
'Evening finally came, and the Cyclops returned
with his sheep.

1187
01:43:57,269 --> 01:44:02,519
This time he left none of the sheep outside
in the walled area.

1188
01:44:02,519 --> 01:44:07,719
When they were all safely inside the cave
with him, he closed the entrance with the

1189
01:44:07,719 --> 01:44:13,709
stone, did the milking, took another two of
my men and started eating.

1190
01:44:13,709 --> 01:44:19,650
Trying to hide my fear, I went to him with
a wooden bowl full of the wine that I had

1191
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:21,460
brought with me.

1192
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:28,190
"Here, Cyclops, have some wine to wash down
your meal.

1193
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:31,320
There was some very fine wine on our ship.

1194
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:37,860
We brought it to you as a gift, hoping that
you would help us on our journey home.

1195
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:43,959
We wanted to be your friends, but your treatment
of us has been more terrible than we ever

1196
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:45,119
imagined.

1197
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:48,940
Are you not ashamed of your behavior?"

1198
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:52,209
The Cyclops laughed and took the wine.

1199
01:44:52,209 --> 01:44:57,949
"It tasted so good that he drank it quickly
and asked for more."

1200
01:44:57,949 --> 01:45:04,270
"And while you pour it, tell me your name,"
he said.

1201
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:12,429
"I would like to give you a present too - something
that you will really like.

1202
01:45:12,429 --> 01:45:19,809
We Cyclopes have wine, too, but it is nothing
compared to this drink of yours."

1203
01:45:19,809 --> 01:45:27,730
'I gave him another bowlful of wine, and he
drank it even more quickly than before.

1204
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:32,869
Three times I filled the bowl for him, and
three times the fool drank to the bottom of

1205
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:34,739
the bowl.

1206
01:45:34,739 --> 01:45:43,929
Finally, when the wine had confused his mind,
I said, "Cyclops, you asked me my name.

1207
01:45:43,929 --> 01:45:50,749
I will tell you, and then you can give me
the gift that you have promised.

1208
01:45:50,749 --> 01:45:56,079
My name is Nobody."

1209
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:02,459
The cruel monster answered, "And here is my
gift.

1210
01:46:02,459 --> 01:46:09,909
Of all these men, I will eat Nobody last."

1211
01:46:09,909 --> 01:46:20,270
'Soon after he said this, he fell to the ground.

1212
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:26,340
He did not get up, but lay on his back, laughing,
until he went to sleep.

1213
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:30,459
In this alcoholic sleep, he was sick.

1214
01:46:30,459 --> 01:46:35,040
Wine mixed with bits of my eaten men poured
from his mouth.

1215
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:39,019
It was hard not to be sick ourselves at this
terrible sight.

1216
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:41,719
But this was our moment to act.

1217
01:46:41,719 --> 01:46:46,829
I put the end of our stick into the dying
fire to make it hot.

1218
01:46:46,829 --> 01:46:53,119
Just before the stick started to burn, I pulled
it out of the fire.

1219
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:58,749
Then my companions and I drove the sharp point
of the stick into the Cyclops's eye.

1220
01:46:58,749 --> 01:47:04,760
With all our force, we held it there, as his
eye smoked and burned.

1221
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:10,590
He gave a terrible scream, and we moved away
in terror.

1222
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:16,489
'He pulled the stick from his eye, which was
pouring blood onto the ground.

1223
01:47:16,489 --> 01:47:22,479
Throwing the stick away, he called to the
other Cyclopes who lived in caves in the area.

1224
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:27,000
Hearing his screams, they came to find out
what was wrong.

1225
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,010
From outside the cave, they shouted, "What
is the matter, Polyphemus?

1226
01:47:33,010 --> 01:47:37,489
Why have you woken us all up with those screams
and shouts of yours?

1227
01:47:37,489 --> 01:47:42,239
Is someone stealing your sheep or trying to
kill you?"

1228
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:46,249
Out of the cave came Polyphemus's reply.

1229
01:47:46,249 --> 01:47:52,229
"My friends, Nobody is trying to kill me."

1230
01:47:52,229 --> 01:48:00,210
"Well, if no one is attacking you and your
sheep are safe, you must be crazy," said his

1231
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:01,329
neighbours.

1232
01:48:01,329 --> 01:48:08,059
"Illnesses of the mind are sent by Zeus, so
we can do nothing to help you.

1233
01:48:08,059 --> 01:48:12,540
You should pray to your father, the god Poseidon."

1234
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:21,159
'And his neighbours went home, while I laughed
that my false name had tricked them so easily.

1235
01:48:21,159 --> 01:48:25,270
The Cyclops was still crying out in pain.

1236
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:30,239
He felt around the mouth of the cave with
his hands, hoping to catch us as we tried

1237
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:31,239
to escape.

1238
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:37,250
Did he really think that I was so stupid?

1239
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:43,479
But if we wanted to leave the land of the
Cyclopes alive, we needed a good plan.

1240
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:47,170
I spent a long time thinking.

1241
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:51,659
In the end, this is what I decided to do.

1242
01:48:51,659 --> 01:49:00,560
'The male sheep in the cave were fine animals,
big and strong with coats of thick black wool.

1243
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:05,639
I quietly tied these sheep together in groups
of three, putting one of my men under the

1244
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:12,209
middle sheep in each group so that there was
a sheep on either side to protect him.

1245
01:49:12,209 --> 01:49:16,300
For myself I chose the biggest sheep of all.

1246
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:22,050
I held on to his wool and hung upside-down
between his legs.

1247
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:32,630
We waited like this until morning.

1248
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:37,130
When it grew light, the sheep made their way
to the mouth of the cave.

1249
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:43,309
Their master, although still in great pain,
passed his hands over the backs of all the

1250
01:49:43,309 --> 01:49:46,739
animals as they stopped in front of him.

1251
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:54,090
The fool never thought of looking under the
sheep's chests, where my men were tied.

1252
01:49:54,090 --> 01:50:00,709
My own sheep was the last one to reach the
doorway; he walked more slowly than the others

1253
01:50:00,709 --> 01:50:04,210
because of my heavy weight.

1254
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:14,210
As Polyphemus felt his back, he said, "Dear
sheep, why are you the last to leave today?

1255
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:20,329
Usually you lead your companions proudly to
the best grass and the clearest water in the

1256
01:50:20,329 --> 01:50:25,590
stream, and return first in the evening to
the cave.

1257
01:50:25,590 --> 01:50:30,249
But today you are last of all.

1258
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:33,860
You must be sad about your master's eye.

1259
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:39,420
How cruel was the man who did this to me!

1260
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:44,959
Nobody was his name, and I will find a way
to punish him.

1261
01:50:44,959 --> 01:50:47,179
He is not safe yet.

1262
01:50:47,179 --> 01:50:54,659
Ah, if you had a voice, you could tell me
where to look for him.

1263
01:50:54,659 --> 01:51:02,079
I would break open his head on the floor of
the cave to pay him back for the pain that

1264
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:04,140
he has caused me!"

1265
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:11,640
With these words, he let the sheep pass through
the mouth of the cave.

1266
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:17,840
When we were a safe distance from the Cyclops,
I came out from under my sheep and untied

1267
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,459
my companions.

1268
01:51:20,459 --> 01:51:24,570
Then we quickly drove the sheep down towards
our ship.

1269
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:30,260
The men at the ship were very happy to see
us, but their smiles soon disappeared when

1270
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:35,469
they heard of the terrible fate of our lost
companions.

1271
01:51:35,469 --> 01:51:41,889
Their loud crying was putting us all in danger,
so I made them get the sheep onto the ship

1272
01:51:41,889 --> 01:51:44,519
as quickly and quietly as possible.

1273
01:51:44,519 --> 01:51:52,189
Then the crew sat at their oars and took the
ship out to sea.

1274
01:51:52,189 --> 01:51:57,889
Before we were too far from Polyphemus, I
shouted, "Cyclops!

1275
01:51:57,889 --> 01:52:02,979
Your strength could not protect you from the
resourceful Greeks.

1276
01:52:02,979 --> 01:52:07,479
This is your punishment for eating your guests."

1277
01:52:07,479 --> 01:52:13,209
My words made the Cyclops so angry that he
pulled a great rock from the mountainside

1278
01:52:13,209 --> 01:52:15,780
and threw it at us.

1279
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:23,539
It fell just in front of our ship, causing
a wave that sent us back towards the shore.

1280
01:52:23,539 --> 01:52:29,820
With a long stick, I pushed us back out to
sea, and the crew pulled hard on their oars

1281
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:35,530
to save us from disaster.

1282
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:40,480
When I started to shout at the Cyclops again,
my men tried to stop me.

1283
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,959
"Why do you want to anger this monster?"

1284
01:52:43,959 --> 01:52:44,959
they asked.

1285
01:52:44,959 --> 01:52:48,080
"He nearly killed us with that last rock.

1286
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,060
The next one will certainly be the end of
us."

1287
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:56,179
'But I was too full of emotion to listen to
their advice.

1288
01:52:56,179 --> 01:52:57,329
"Cyclops!"

1289
01:52:57,329 --> 01:53:04,300
I shouted again, "you should know the name
of the man who blinded you.

1290
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:12,920
If anyone asks you, tell them that it was
Odysseus, destroyer of cities, son of Laertes,

1291
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,280
who lives on the island of Ithaca."

1292
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:24,150
'The Cyclops cried sadly, "So the prophecy
was true!

1293
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:32,099
Long ago I was warned that a man called Odysseus
would rob me of my sight.

1294
01:53:32,099 --> 01:53:39,179
But I had always expected a powerful man,
someone bigger and stronger than me.

1295
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:50,199
And here you are, a weak little man who confused
my mind with wine and destroyed my eye.

1296
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:57,869
But come here, Odysseus, so that I can give
you some gifts and ask Poseidon to protect

1297
01:53:57,869 --> 01:54:00,969
you on your voyage home.

1298
01:54:00,969 --> 01:54:06,219
Poseidon is my father, so he will listen to
my request.

1299
01:54:06,219 --> 01:54:11,159
He will give me back my sight, too, if that
is my fate."

1300
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:17,189
I shouted in reply, "You are a fool, Cyclops.

1301
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:20,530
Poseidon will never mend your eye."

1302
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:26,459
The Cyclops held up his hands to the sky and
prayed to his father.

1303
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:31,280
"Poseidon, hear your son's request.

1304
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:37,130
Stop Odysseus, son of Laertes, from reaching
his home in Ithaca.

1305
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:39,900
That is my dearest wish.

1306
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:44,749
But if you cannot do this, at least give him
a terrible journey.

1307
01:54:44,749 --> 01:54:55,369
Kill his companions, destroy his ships, and
cause trouble in his palace at home."

1308
01:54:55,369 --> 01:54:58,650
The sea-god Poseidon was listening.

1309
01:54:58,650 --> 01:55:06,380
Again, the Cyclops picked up a great rock
- an even bigger one than before - and threw

1310
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:09,219
it with all his strength at our ship.

1311
01:55:09,219 --> 01:55:16,090
This time, though, we were further from the
shore; the rock fell behind us and its wave

1312
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:19,409
swept us forward to safety.

1313
01:55:19,409 --> 01:55:24,800
At last, we reached the island where the rest
of the men were waiting for our return.

1314
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:31,920
We shared the sheep equally between the twelve
ships, but the men gave me the sheep that

1315
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,619
had carried me out of Polyphemus's cave.

1316
01:55:35,619 --> 01:55:38,530
I sacrificed this fine animal to the great
god Zeus.

1317
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:44,320
But Zeus was not interested in the sacrifice.

1318
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:55,960
He was already busy planning the death of
all my loyal companions.'

1319
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:59,229
CHAPTER SIX
Circe

1320
01:55:59,229 --> 01:56:04,760
'They had taken the shape of pigs.

1321
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:11,900
Their minds were still human, but they could
not speak; only pig noises came from their

1322
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:15,010
mouths.'

1323
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:21,769
We sailed towards home, thinking sadly of
the dead friends that we were leaving behind.

1324
01:56:21,769 --> 01:56:30,389
Next we came to the island of Aeolia, the
home of Aeolus and his twelve children - six

1325
01:56:30,389 --> 01:56:34,249
daughters and six fine sons.

1326
01:56:34,249 --> 01:56:40,249
Each son is married to one of the daughters,
and they spend all their days with their parents,

1327
01:56:40,249 --> 01:56:43,340
eating wonderful food from dishes of gold.

1328
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:48,099
'For a whole month Aeolus entertained us.

1329
01:56:48,099 --> 01:56:55,020
He wanted to know all about the war in Troy,
the Greek army, and our return home.

1330
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,659
I told him everything that I could.

1331
01:56:58,659 --> 01:57:04,039
I soon learnt that Zeus had given Aeolus control
of the winds.

1332
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:09,179
He offered to help us on our journey by giving
me a leather bag in which all the strong and

1333
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:12,499
stormy winds were kept prisoner.

1334
01:57:12,499 --> 01:57:18,670
He put this bag carefully in my ship and tied
it up tightly so that the winds had no chance

1335
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:20,939
of escape.

1336
01:57:20,939 --> 01:57:26,770
Then he sent us on our way with a gentle wind
from the west, which blew our ships safely

1337
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:29,439
towards home.

1338
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:32,170
For nine days we sailed east.

1339
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:36,889
I guided the ship home myself, without a minute's
rest.

1340
01:57:36,889 --> 01:57:42,929
Then, finally, our homeland came into view.

1341
01:57:42,929 --> 01:57:48,400
We could even see people working outside their
houses.

1342
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:55,940
At last I felt that I could relax, and fell
into a deep sleep.

1343
01:57:55,940 --> 01:58:01,000
While I slept, my crew started talking about
the bag from Aeolus.

1344
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:06,940
"There must be a fortune in gold and silver
in that bag," they said.

1345
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:09,849
"Odysseus is so greedy.

1346
01:58:09,849 --> 01:58:16,659
He is going home rich, but we, who have travelled
the same distances and lived through the same

1347
01:58:16,659 --> 01:58:20,150
dangers, are returning with nothing.

1348
01:58:20,150 --> 01:58:22,699
It is just not fair!

1349
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:28,300
Let us see how much treasure he has got in
that bag."

1350
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:32,370
Without stopping to think, they untied the
bag.

1351
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:38,010
Immediately the winds rushed out and a violent
storm blew up.

1352
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:45,079
Our twelve ships were carried back out to
sea, far away from our homes on Ithaca.

1353
01:58:45,079 --> 01:58:48,340
The men were all crying when I woke up.

1354
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:55,449
When I realized what had happened, I nearly
threw myself into the sea to end my life.

1355
01:58:55,449 --> 01:59:05,039
But I stayed on the ship, and we were all
driven back to the island of Aeolus.

1356
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:11,479
After a quick rest on the beach, I went with
two companions to Aeolus's palace.

1357
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:15,590
When he saw us outside his hall, he cried,
"Odysseus?

1358
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:19,030
What unlucky fate has brought you here again?"

1359
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:26,650
'Sadly, I answered, "The stupidity of my crew
and my own need for sleep have brought me

1360
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:27,730
back.

1361
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:30,510
Please, help me again.

1362
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:33,540
I am sure that this time my voyage will be
successful."

1363
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:36,949
'He was silent.

1364
01:59:36,949 --> 01:59:42,889
Finally, he shouted, "Get off this island
at once!

1365
01:59:42,889 --> 01:59:48,050
It is not right for me to help a man who is
so hated by the gods.

1366
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:53,139
Your arrival here proves that you have no
friends on Mount Olympus.

1367
01:59:53,139 --> 01:59:56,059
Leave now!"

1368
01:59:56,059 --> 02:00:04,699
His words upset me deeply, but I left the
palace as he ordered and returned to the ships.

1369
02:00:04,699 --> 02:00:10,730
We sailed for home again, but with none of
the good humor that went with us on our earlier

1370
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:16,499
voyage.

1371
02:00:16,499 --> 02:00:22,219
After six days at sea, we reached the land
of the Laestrygonians.

1372
02:00:22,219 --> 02:00:28,489
There we found a great curve of beach circled
by high walls of rock, with only a narrow

1373
02:00:28,489 --> 02:00:30,349
entrance.

1374
02:00:30,349 --> 02:00:36,940
The captains of the other ships sailed straight
in and landed on the shore.

1375
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:38,800
I did not follow them.

1376
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:45,659
Instead, I tied my own ship to a rock just
outside the entrance.

1377
02:00:45,659 --> 02:00:51,690
We all climbed up the steep rocks to find
out what kind of land we had come to.

1378
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:58,429
We saw no farms and no people, but there was
some smoke in the distance.

1379
02:00:58,429 --> 02:01:03,239
I sent three of my men in the direction of
the smoke.

1380
02:01:03,239 --> 02:01:08,850
They followed a path for some time, until
they saw a big, strong girl carrying buckets

1381
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:11,989
of water into a town.

1382
02:01:11,989 --> 02:01:17,360
When they asked her about her country's king,
she pointed to the high roof of her father's

1383
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:19,080
home.

1384
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,080
She was the daughter of King Antiphates.

1385
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:29,729
The men entered the king's palace and met
his wife, a woman as tall as a mountain.

1386
02:01:29,729 --> 02:01:35,949
They stood still in terror as she called her
husband from the city's meeting-place.

1387
02:01:35,949 --> 02:01:42,570
When the enormous Antiphates arrived, he immediately
caught one of my companions in his hands and

1388
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:44,929
ate him.

1389
02:01:44,929 --> 02:01:49,849
The other two ran away, and managed to reach
the ships.

1390
02:01:49,849 --> 02:01:57,610
But Antiphates was soon at the coast with
an army of monstrous Laestrygonians.

1391
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:07,350
Standing high above the beach, they threw
rocks down at the ships and men on the shore.

1392
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:13,269
When the ships were all broken, they picked
up the men one by one and ate them.

1393
02:02:13,269 --> 02:02:20,400
The cries of the dying men were terrible,
but I could do nothing to help them.

1394
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:26,059
My ship was beyond the entrance to the beach,
safe from the monsters.

1395
02:02:26,059 --> 02:02:31,979
My crew, fearing for their lives, pulled hard
on their oars, and we were soon in the safety

1396
02:02:31,979 --> 02:02:34,949
of the open sea.

1397
02:02:34,949 --> 02:02:39,510
But that was the end of all the other ships.

1398
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:45,400
My crew and I travelled across the sea to
the island of Aeaea.

1399
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:51,630
There we lay on the beach for two days, not
eating or drinking, but thinking sadly about

1400
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:54,469
our lost companions.

1401
02:02:54,469 --> 02:03:00,260
On the morning of the third day, I climbed
a hill to look at the island.

1402
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:04,400
There was just one house, in the middle of
a forest.

1403
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,239
I decided not to go there at once.

1404
02:03:07,239 --> 02:03:13,329
Instead, I went hunting and returned to my
men with some fresh meat.

1405
02:03:13,329 --> 02:03:22,280
"My friends," I said to them, "disaster has
followed disaster recently, but we are still

1406
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:24,449
alive.

1407
02:03:24,449 --> 02:03:27,019
Get up and eat.

1408
02:03:27,019 --> 02:03:30,010
There is no point in dying from hunger."

1409
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:36,920
They did as I advised, and when night came,
they were feeling a little stronger and more

1410
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:38,830
hopeful.

1411
02:03:38,830 --> 02:03:41,079
The next morning, I called a meeting.

1412
02:03:41,079 --> 02:03:45,809
"I will not lie to you, friends," I began.

1413
02:03:45,809 --> 02:03:49,099
"We are completely lost.

1414
02:03:49,099 --> 02:03:54,510
With all these clouds in the sky, we do not
even know which way is east.

1415
02:03:54,510 --> 02:04:01,389
We must make a sensible plan, but I do not
know what to suggest.

1416
02:04:01,389 --> 02:04:06,499
We are on an island, and there is a house
in the middle of a forest.

1417
02:04:06,499 --> 02:04:09,650
There is nothing else that I can tell you."

1418
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:13,949
At this news, the men lost all hope.

1419
02:04:13,949 --> 02:04:21,590
They thought of the Laestrygonians and refused
to visit any more strangers.

1420
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:25,570
But we had to find help from somewhere.

1421
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:30,290
In the end, I put the men into two groups.

1422
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:35,400
We said goodbye to each other with tears in
our eyes, fearing that we would never meet

1423
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:38,370
again.

1424
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:46,389
My group stayed by the ships and Eurylochus
led the other group into the forest.

1425
02:04:46,389 --> 02:04:51,419
Between the trees, they soon found a house
built of stone.

1426
02:04:51,419 --> 02:04:56,130
Dangerous animals surrounded the house, but
instead of attacking the men, they greeted

1427
02:04:56,130 --> 02:05:02,770
them as a friendly dog greets its master.

1428
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:08,030
The men stopped, confused by this unusual
behavior.

1429
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:13,469
'They could hear a woman singing inside the
house.

1430
02:05:13,469 --> 02:05:18,100
After a whispered discussion, the men decided
to call out to her.

1431
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:20,050
She came quickly.

1432
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:25,360
She said that her name was Circe, and she
invited them in.

1433
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:29,590
In their innocence, they followed her into
the house.

1434
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:33,390
Only Eurylochus sensed the danger and stayed
outside.

1435
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:37,900
Circe gave the rest of the men a wonderful
meal.

1436
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:41,749
But she had added a magic drug to their drink.

1437
02:05:41,749 --> 02:05:47,639
When the men finished, they saw that they
had taken the shape of pigs.

1438
02:05:47,639 --> 02:05:53,809
Their minds were still human, but they could
not speak, only pig noises came from their

1439
02:05:53,809 --> 02:05:55,300
mouths.

1440
02:05:55,300 --> 02:06:00,869
Circe took a stick and drove them outside.

1441
02:06:00,869 --> 02:06:08,249
There they sat in the mud, eating the pig
food that she threw to them.

1442
02:06:08,249 --> 02:06:14,260
After waiting near the house for several hours,
Eurylochus ran back to the ship.

1443
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:21,070
In tears, he told us that none of his companions
had reappeared after they had entered Circe's

1444
02:06:21,070 --> 02:06:22,070
house.

1445
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:28,189
I picked up my sword and asked him to lead
the way back there.

1446
02:06:28,189 --> 02:06:32,710
He went down on his knees, crying, "No, Odysseus,
please!

1447
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:35,239
Do not make me go with you.

1448
02:06:35,239 --> 02:06:39,659
You cannot help the others, and you will not
return yourself.

1449
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:44,469
It is better to sail away quickly with the
men that are left."

1450
02:06:44,469 --> 02:06:48,580
"Dry your tears, Eurylochus," I replied.

1451
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:50,880
"You can stay by the ship.

1452
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:58,989
But I must go - I have no choice."

1453
02:06:58,989 --> 02:07:02,119
I walked into the forest alone.

1454
02:07:02,119 --> 02:07:08,999
I was near Circe's house when I met Hermes,
the messenger of the gods.

1455
02:07:08,999 --> 02:07:14,579
He took my hand and said, "Where are you going
now, Odysseus?

1456
02:07:14,579 --> 02:07:18,679
Are you planning to free your friends from
Circe's magic?

1457
02:07:18,679 --> 02:07:20,400
Be careful!

1458
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,840
She has turned them into pigs.

1459
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:28,010
You are likely to suffer the same fate and
never see your homeland again.

1460
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:31,119
But I can help you.

1461
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:36,159
This flower is a drug that will protect you
from Circe's magic.

1462
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:42,739
Eat it now, and when she hits you with her
stick, attack her with your sword.

1463
02:07:42,739 --> 02:07:48,519
She will be very frightened and will immediately
ask to be your friend.

1464
02:07:48,519 --> 02:07:50,209
You should agree.

1465
02:07:50,209 --> 02:07:55,419
But first make her promise not to trick you
or drug you again."

1466
02:07:55,419 --> 02:08:01,770
I ate the white flower that he gave me.

1467
02:08:01,770 --> 02:08:06,800
Then I continued along the path to Circe's
house.

1468
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:09,409
I stood outside and called.

1469
02:08:09,409 --> 02:08:13,749
Circe heard me and invited me in.

1470
02:08:13,749 --> 02:08:22,110
She gave me some of her magic drink, but because
of Hermes's drug, it had no effect on me.

1471
02:08:22,110 --> 02:08:29,190
She hit me with her stick and shouted, "Go
and join your pig friends in the mud!"

1472
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:34,510
At that moment, I attacked her with my sword.

1473
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:41,560
She went down on her knees, screaming and
crying, and said, "Who are you and where are

1474
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,429
you from?

1475
02:08:43,429 --> 02:08:50,519
You are the only man who has ever had that
magic drink and not suffered any ill effects.

1476
02:08:50,519 --> 02:08:52,989
You must be Odysseus.

1477
02:08:52,989 --> 02:08:58,679
Hermes has often warned me to expect you on
your way back from Troy.

1478
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:01,309
But we should not be enemies.

1479
02:09:01,309 --> 02:09:03,070
Let us be friends."

1480
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:11,999
"Circe," I replied, "how can we be friends
when you have turned my companions into pigs?

1481
02:09:11,999 --> 02:09:18,840
I will only agree if you promise not to trick
me or drug me again."

1482
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:23,850
She promised, and so we went back inside.

1483
02:09:23,850 --> 02:09:31,179
She gave me a bath, dressed me in new clothes
and offered me more food.

1484
02:09:31,179 --> 02:09:36,429
When she saw that I was not eating, she asked
me what the matter was.

1485
02:09:36,429 --> 02:09:43,719
"How can I eat," I replied, "when I do not
know if my men are safe?

1486
02:09:43,719 --> 02:09:49,739
There will be no pleasure for me in food and
drink until I see my loyal companions again."

1487
02:09:49,739 --> 02:09:59,060
Circe went outside at once, and came back
with some smelly pigs covered in mud.

1488
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:05,639
She put a special cream on the head of each
one, and they magically turned into men again,

1489
02:10:05,639 --> 02:10:10,849
but younger, taller and more handsome than
before.

1490
02:10:10,849 --> 02:10:14,440
We all cried tears of happiness.

1491
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,030
It was wonderful to see everyone safe and
well.

1492
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:25,429
Circe now told me to fetch the rest of my
men from the seashore.

1493
02:10:25,429 --> 02:10:29,829
When they saw me, they greeted me with great
excitement.

1494
02:10:29,829 --> 02:10:34,219
They had been sure that I would never return.

1495
02:10:34,219 --> 02:10:40,499
We pulled the ship onto dry land and hid our
treasure and equipment in a cave.

1496
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:45,919
The men were in a hurry to see their friends
at Circe s house, but Eurylochus stopped them.

1497
02:10:45,919 --> 02:10:50,999
"Where are you going now, you fools?" he said
to them.

1498
02:10:50,999 --> 02:10:56,190
"Have you learned nothing from the past few
weeks?

1499
02:10:56,190 --> 02:11:00,269
Odysseus leads us from one disaster to another.

1500
02:11:00,269 --> 02:11:06,130
It is because of his thoughtless love of adventure
that our companions died in the Cyclops's

1501
02:11:06,130 --> 02:11:08,980
cave."

1502
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:15,159
When I heard Eurylochus's words, I nearly
cut his head from his body with my sword.

1503
02:11:15,159 --> 02:11:18,090
But my men held me back.

1504
02:11:18,090 --> 02:11:23,079
"Let Eurylochus stay here with the ship,"
they said.

1505
02:11:23,079 --> 02:11:27,999
"The rest of us want to go with you to meet
Circe."

1506
02:11:27,999 --> 02:11:31,820
In the end, Eurylochus came too.

1507
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:35,179
He did not want to stay alone by the ship.

1508
02:11:35,179 --> 02:11:42,900
So together we walked back to Circes house
and found our companions having baths.

1509
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:46,050
Everyone greeted each other with tears in
their eyes.

1510
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:53,230
Then Circe ordered her servants to prepare
a meal, and we celebrated our first evening

1511
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:59,580
at Circe's house in very good humor.'

1512
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:05,249
CHAPTER SEVEN
Teiresias's Prophecy

1513
02:12:05,249 --> 02:12:11,479
If you leave his cows unharmed, you will arrive
safely in Ithaca.

1514
02:12:11,479 --> 02:12:18,050
But if you hurt those cows, your ship and
your men will be destroyed.'

1515
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:25,829
Circe was a very welcoming hostess, and we
stayed with her for a whole year.

1516
02:12:25,829 --> 02:12:31,330
But as the months passed and the long days
of summer returned, my companions became anxious

1517
02:12:31,330 --> 02:12:34,059
that I had forgotten my home in Ithaca.

1518
02:12:34,059 --> 02:12:38,139
"Why are we still here on Circe's island?"

1519
02:12:38,139 --> 02:12:39,699
they asked me one day.

1520
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:44,500
"It is time to continue our voyage."

1521
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,269
That night I spoke to Circe.

1522
02:12:47,269 --> 02:12:54,349
I told her about my companions' complaints,
and she agreed to help us with our voyage.

1523
02:12:54,349 --> 02:13:03,590
"But first," she said, "you must visit the
Underworld and talk to blind old Teiresias.

1524
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:09,689
Although he is dead, his prophecies are as
true as they were during his lifetime."

1525
02:13:09,689 --> 02:13:13,909
This news broke my heart.

1526
02:13:13,909 --> 02:13:20,220
I nearly chose to end my life there in Circe's
house to escape the awful journey to the world

1527
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:22,460
of the dead.

1528
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:27,250
But finally I asked her, "How can I find the
way?

1529
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:29,909
No one has ever sailed a ship into Hell."

1530
02:13:29,909 --> 02:13:32,050
"Do not worry.

1531
02:13:32,050 --> 02:13:37,159
The north wind will blow you to the right
place.

1532
02:13:37,159 --> 02:13:42,590
At the edge of the world, you will see a place
where tall trees grow.

1533
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:50,250
Land your ship there and the ghosts of the
Underworld will come to you."

1534
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:56,090
She told me what to do and say when I reached
that terrible place.

1535
02:13:56,090 --> 02:14:01,429
She promised that Teiresias would tell me
the route of my journey home.

1536
02:14:01,429 --> 02:14:06,880
Waking everyone up in the morning, I shouted,
"Hurry, my friends, and say goodbye to your

1537
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,880
comfortable beds.

1538
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,389
It is time to go.

1539
02:14:10,389 --> 02:14:16,209
Circe has given us instructions for the next
part of our journey."

1540
02:14:16,209 --> 02:14:21,169
My brave companions were happy to make their
way back to the ship.

1541
02:14:21,169 --> 02:14:25,159
But even this time I did not lead everyone
away safely.

1542
02:14:25,159 --> 02:14:30,099
Elpenor was the youngest in our group, and
not very clever.

1543
02:14:30,099 --> 02:14:37,139
The night before, after too much wine, he
had decided to sleep on the roof because the

1544
02:14:37,139 --> 02:14:39,380
air was fresher there.

1545
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:47,590
Woken in the morning by the noise of our departure,
he jumped up suddenly and fell off the roof.

1546
02:14:47,590 --> 02:14:50,260
The fall broke his neck.

1547
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:54,239
When we went to help him, we found him dead.

1548
02:14:54,239 --> 02:15:00,769
By the ship, I told the men that our voyage
would not take us straight home.

1549
02:15:00,769 --> 02:15:07,429
When they heard that our destination was the
world of the dead, they were filled with terror.

1550
02:15:07,429 --> 02:15:12,669
But they could say nothing to change the fate
that the gods had chosen for us.

1551
02:15:12,669 --> 02:15:20,380
Circe gave us a good wind to fill our sails
and, a day after leaving Aeaea, we reached

1552
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:24,559
a dark land at the edge of the world.

1553
02:15:24,559 --> 02:15:30,179
There we found the place that Circe had described,
where tall trees grow.

1554
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:36,789
I landed the ship and started to follow Circe's
instructions for calling the dead.

1555
02:15:36,789 --> 02:15:41,380
I dug a hole in the ground, the size of a
man's arm.

1556
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:46,510
Into this hole I poured milk, water and sweet
wine.

1557
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:53,219
I prayed to the dead and sacrificed two fine
sheep from my ship.

1558
02:15:53,219 --> 02:16:00,099
As their blood poured into the hole, ghosts
started to come up from the earth - young

1559
02:16:00,099 --> 02:16:06,909
girls, old men, and soldiers killed in war.

1560
02:16:06,909 --> 02:16:12,530
They were making a strange noise, and cold
fear ran through me.

1561
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:15,780
I guarded the hole with my sword held tightly.

1562
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:21,539
I did not want any ghosts to get to the blood
before Teiresias.

1563
02:16:21,539 --> 02:16:27,979
Suddenly, I recognised the ghost of Elpenor.

1564
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:33,800
In our hurry to leave Circe's island, we had
not burnt his body or built a mound of earth

1565
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,319
for him.

1566
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:38,090
I called out, "Elpenor!

1567
02:16:38,090 --> 02:16:43,729
You have reached here more quickly on foot
than we did in our fast ship."

1568
02:16:43,729 --> 02:16:50,460
"Yes, master, but you rushed away from Aeaea
too fast.

1569
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:54,150
Please, when you return, remember my body.

1570
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:59,819
Burn it on the beach with my sword, and build
a mound of earth in my memory.

1571
02:16:59,819 --> 02:17:06,080
At the top, plant the oar that I used on the
ship with my dear companions."

1572
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:12,359
"I will do all that you ask, dear Elpenor,"
I replied.

1573
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:15,660
Teiresias was not far behind him.

1574
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:26,330
"Odysseus, son of Laertes, why have you left
the sunlight to visit the dead in this sad,

1575
02:17:26,330 --> 02:17:28,389
dark place?

1576
02:17:28,389 --> 02:17:33,300
If you want a prophecy, step away from the
blood.

1577
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:39,359
I will tell you your future after I have drunk."

1578
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:51,590
I let him drink the blood, and he soon said,
"My lord Odysseus, you want an easy route

1579
02:17:51,590 --> 02:17:53,139
home.

1580
02:17:53,139 --> 02:18:02,309
But Poseidon is angry about your cruel treatment
of his son, the Cyclops, and he is going to

1581
02:18:02,309 --> 02:18:06,149
make your journey hard.

1582
02:18:06,149 --> 02:18:13,399
You and your men will finally reach home,
though, if you can control your hunger when

1583
02:18:13,399 --> 02:18:17,990
you come to the island of Thrinacie.

1584
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:27,880
There you will find the fat cows of the Sun
god, who can see everything on his daily journey

1585
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:30,309
across the sky.

1586
02:18:30,309 --> 02:18:39,069
If you leave his cows unharmed, you will arrive
safely in Ithaca.

1587
02:18:39,069 --> 02:18:47,849
But if you hurt those cows, your ship and
your men will be destroyed.

1588
02:18:47,849 --> 02:18:57,460
You yourself will return home on a foreign
ship and find your family in terrible trouble.

1589
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:04,800
You will find arrogant suitors in your palace,
eating your food and demanding marriage with

1590
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:08,069
your wife.

1591
02:19:08,069 --> 02:19:11,199
You will kill the suitors for their crimes.

1592
02:19:11,199 --> 02:19:15,380
But then you must start another journey.

1593
02:19:15,380 --> 02:19:24,319
Take an oar and travel until you find a place
where the people know nothing about the sea

1594
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:29,719
and ships and the use of salt in their food.

1595
02:19:29,719 --> 02:19:34,739
You will meet a man who calls your oar a farm
tool.

1596
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:37,769
That will be your sign.

1597
02:19:37,769 --> 02:19:48,559
Plant your oar in the earth and sacrifice
a sheep, a cow and a pig to the great god

1598
02:19:48,559 --> 02:19:49,559
Poseidon.

1599
02:19:49,559 --> 02:19:53,239
After this, you can go home.

1600
02:19:53,239 --> 02:20:01,279
You will have a long life, and you will die
peacefully of old age, far from the terrors

1601
02:20:01,279 --> 02:20:03,500
of the sea."

1602
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:10,770
"So this is the fate that the gods have chosen
for me," I said.

1603
02:20:10,770 --> 02:20:14,630
"Thank you, Teiresias."

1604
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:24,450
As Teiresias went back to the Underworld,
the ghost of my mother, Anticleia, came towards

1605
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:26,029
me.

1606
02:20:26,029 --> 02:20:29,960
I was deeply upset to see her there.

1607
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:34,351
She had been alive when I left Ithaca for
the war in Troy.

1608
02:20:34,351 --> 02:20:39,510
"Mother, tell me what happened to you," I
cried.

1609
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:44,790
"What death brought you to this terrible place?"

1610
02:20:44,790 --> 02:20:50,180
"It was sadness that killed me, Odysseus,
my child.

1611
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:56,320
I missed your wise and gentle ways, and life
gave me no pleasure.

1612
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:58,990
In death, I have escaped that pain."

1613
02:20:58,990 --> 02:21:05,500
I tried to put my arms around her, but there
was nothing to hold.

1614
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:08,270
My arms went straight through her.

1615
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:11,560
"You cannot touch me, Odysseus.

1616
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:16,120
When life leaves the body, we become no more
than a dream.

1617
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:23,590
But go now, return to the world of the sun,
and find your way back home."

1618
02:21:23,590 --> 02:21:28,330
"But what can you tell me about home," I asked
her.

1619
02:21:28,330 --> 02:21:30,800
"How is the rest of the family?

1620
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:33,779
Are they safe and well?"

1621
02:21:33,779 --> 02:21:39,989
"Penelope and Telemachus are still living
in your palace, trying to keep your lands

1622
02:21:39,989 --> 02:21:42,390
safe from the greedy suitors.

1623
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:49,989
But your father Laertes lives a sad and lonely
life, alone on his fruit farm.

1624
02:21:49,989 --> 02:21:53,220
He never goes down to the city now.

1625
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:59,689
In winter he sleeps on the floor by his fire,
without a bed or a blanket to keep him warm.

1626
02:21:59,689 --> 02:22:05,060
In summer, he sleeps under the fruit trees
in a bed of leaves.

1627
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:12,649
As old age presses down on him, he thinks
of nothing except your return."

1628
02:22:12,649 --> 02:22:18,939
Soon Persephone, Queen of the Underworld,
drove away my mother and the other women ghosts

1629
02:22:18,939 --> 02:22:20,979
who were with her.

1630
02:22:20,979 --> 02:22:28,189
In shock, I saw another ghost that I recognised
- Agamemnon.

1631
02:22:28,189 --> 02:22:33,890
He drank the dark blood and stretched out
his hand towards me.

1632
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:39,020
But all the strength had left the body that
had been so powerful, and he could not reach

1633
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:40,680
me.

1634
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:44,670
He and I looked at each other with tears in
our eyes.

1635
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:51,670
Finally, I said, "Great king, what terrible
fate has brought you here?

1636
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:58,330
Were you killed in a storm on your way home
from Troy, or in a fight on enemy lands?"

1637
02:22:58,330 --> 02:23:02,710
"No, my friend," Agamemnon replied.

1638
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:11,090
"I was murdered when I reached my homeland
by my cousin Aegisthus.

1639
02:23:11,090 --> 02:23:21,220
Aegisthus welcomed me to my palace, then killed
me like a sheep for a sacrifice.

1640
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:26,979
My companions were cut down too, and the floor
of the hall swam with blood.

1641
02:23:26,979 --> 02:23:36,100
You saw the deaths of many fine men at Troy,
Odysseus, but none were as pitiful as ours.

1642
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:45,909
"And, worst of all, my wife Clytaemnestra
was there watching.

1643
02:23:45,909 --> 02:23:54,310
When I was dying, with a sword in my chest,
she turned away coldly and joined her lover,

1644
02:23:54,310 --> 02:23:55,640
Aegisthus.

1645
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:59,899
She did not even close my eyes or mouth for
me in death."

1646
02:23:59,899 --> 02:24:02,120
"Poor man!"

1647
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:04,340
I cried.

1648
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:10,810
"Zeus has been a cruel enemy to your family,
using the tricks of women to destroy your

1649
02:24:10,810 --> 02:24:12,550
happiness.

1650
02:24:12,550 --> 02:24:20,930
Your brother s wife Helen caused the Trojan
War, and now your own wife has sent you here."

1651
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:23,760
"Yes," replied Agamemnon.

1652
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:35,149
"Never tell a woman all your secrets, Odysseus,
not even your wife, because one day she may

1653
02:24:35,149 --> 02:24:38,020
turn against you.

1654
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:42,500
When you reach home, do not sail openly into
port.

1655
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:47,120
Hide your return until you are sure that you
are safe.

1656
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:52,090
But you are luckier than I was, my friend.

1657
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:59,840
Your own wife, Penelope, has a loyal heart
and a wise head."

1658
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:03,420
I said a sad goodbye to Agamemnon.

1659
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:08,200
I had learned what I needed to in this terrible
place.

1660
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:13,550
It was time to leave.

1661
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:20,029
I called to my men to get the ship ready,
and soon we were on our way.

1662
02:25:20,029 --> 02:25:28,680
With a good wind in our sails, we quickly
reached Aeaea, the island of beautiful Circe.

1663
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:34,810
We found Elpenors body and took it to the
highest place on the coast.

1664
02:25:34,810 --> 02:25:39,510
There we built a fire and placed his body
on it.

1665
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:43,870
We watched sadly as the flames surrounded
him.

1666
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:49,979
When the fire was dead, we covered the place
with a mound of earth and planted Elpenor's

1667
02:25:49,979 --> 02:25:52,560
oar on top.

1668
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:57,270
I prayed that his death would be the last
on our journey home.

1669
02:25:57,270 --> 02:26:05,310
Circe had noticed our return, and came now
with her servants, carrying bread, meat and

1670
02:26:05,310 --> 02:26:06,939
wine.

1671
02:26:06,939 --> 02:26:13,449
We had a good meal on the beach, in preparation
for our voyage the next day.

1672
02:26:13,449 --> 02:26:20,609
When it grew dark, my men went to sleep by
the ship, but Circe held me back.

1673
02:26:20,609 --> 02:26:24,540
She wanted to warn me about the dangers of
the voyage ahead.

1674
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:33,439
"Listen to my advice, Odysseus, and hopefully
you will remember it when you need it most.

1675
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:36,859
You will soon meet the Sirens.

1676
02:26:36,859 --> 02:26:42,040
They sit on their island, singing to the sailors
who pass.

1677
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:48,740
They ask people to come closer, and their
voices are so beautiful that the sailors cannot

1678
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:49,810
refuse.

1679
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:53,050
But be careful.

1680
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:57,979
Piles of dead bodies lie all around that island.

1681
02:26:57,979 --> 02:27:02,109
Its rocks destroy any ship that goes near.

1682
02:27:02,109 --> 02:27:07,939
But it is possible to sail past safely.

1683
02:27:07,939 --> 02:27:15,590
Put wax in the ears of your crew, so that
they cannot hear the Sirens' magical song.

1684
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:22,190
If you wish to hear it yourself, your men
must tie you tightly to the ship.

1685
02:27:22,190 --> 02:27:28,760
They must not free you until the danger has
passed.

1686
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:35,149
When the Sirens are behind you, you will have
to choose between two routes.

1687
02:27:35,149 --> 02:27:42,750
One takes you to the Moving Rocks, which crash
together whenever a ship sails between them.

1688
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:48,479
Even the birds cannot fly through this place
safely, but lose a wing or a tail when the

1689
02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:50,710
rocks squeeze tight.

1690
02:27:50,710 --> 02:27:57,500
For sailors, there is no hope of escape.

1691
02:27:57,500 --> 02:28:01,149
In the other direction lie two rocks.

1692
02:28:01,149 --> 02:28:06,160
One is so tall and steep that no one could
climb to the top of it.

1693
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:15,189
Half way up there is a cave, and this is the
home of the monster Scylla.

1694
02:28:15,189 --> 02:28:23,210
She is a terrible sight, with twelve feet
and six long necks, each ending in a head

1695
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:26,740
full of teeth as sharp as knives.

1696
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:32,899
She lies in her cave, stretching her long
necks down to the sea in search of seals and

1697
02:28:32,899 --> 02:28:35,159
fish to eat.

1698
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:39,590
No crew has ever passed her without losing
men.

1699
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:45,540
She always catches a sailor in each of her
six mouths.

1700
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:52,319
The other rock is not as high, and is only
a short distance across the water from Scylla's

1701
02:28:52,319 --> 02:28:53,319
cave.

1702
02:28:53,319 --> 02:29:00,460
A fruit tree grows from the rock, and below
it the awful Charybdis pulls down the dark

1703
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:03,410
water to the sea floor.

1704
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:09,939
Three times a day she pulls it down, and three
times she throws it up again.

1705
02:29:09,939 --> 02:29:16,399
I pray that the gods keep you away from her,
because not even the sea-god Poseidon could

1706
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:20,340
save your ship from her violent seas.

1707
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:28,810
No, you must stay close to Scylla's rock and
sail past as quickly as you can.

1708
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:33,399
It is better to lose six of your men than
your whole crew."

1709
02:29:33,399 --> 02:29:35,399
"Yes," I replied.

1710
02:29:35,399 --> 02:29:40,779
"But is there really no way to protect all
my men from these two monsters?"

1711
02:29:40,779 --> 02:29:48,890
"Are you still looking for trouble, Odysseus,
after all that you have suffered?

1712
02:29:48,890 --> 02:29:51,189
Scylla is a monster of great power.

1713
02:29:51,189 --> 02:29:53,510
She cannot die.

1714
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:57,520
You will waste time if you try to fight her.

1715
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:01,859
Then she will be able to take even more of
your men.

1716
02:30:01,859 --> 02:30:06,899
No, you must accept your fate.

1717
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:12,649
Sacrifice six of your men and the rest will
be safe."

1718
02:30:12,649 --> 02:30:16,890
As she finished speaking, the sun came up.

1719
02:30:16,890 --> 02:30:22,470
I said goodbye to Circe and went back to my
companions.

1720
02:30:22,470 --> 02:30:27,540
We untied the ship and were soon on our way.

1721
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:32,270
We made good progress as the men pulled on
their oars.

1722
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:36,500
It was time to prepare them for the danger
ahead.

1723
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:45,229
"My friends, Circe has given me advice for
the rest of our journey.

1724
02:30:45,229 --> 02:30:47,569
I must share it with you.

1725
02:30:47,569 --> 02:30:52,050
First, we will come to the island of the Sirens.

1726
02:30:52,050 --> 02:30:56,909
I will protect your ears from the magic of
the Sirens' song.

1727
02:30:56,909 --> 02:30:59,350
But one of us should listen.

1728
02:30:59,350 --> 02:31:04,159
Tie me very tightly to the ship so that I
cannot escape.

1729
02:31:04,159 --> 02:31:08,880
If I complain, tie me more tightly.

1730
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:14,859
Do not take the ship near the island, even
if I command it a hundred times.

1731
02:31:14,859 --> 02:31:19,260
The rocks destroy all ships that go near."

1732
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:25,770
I took some wax and made it warm in my hands.

1733
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:32,060
Then I pushed a little into everyone's ears,
so that they could hear nothing.

1734
02:31:32,060 --> 02:31:38,780
When this was done, the men tied my hands
and feet to the ship, and we were ready to

1735
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:41,550
continue.

1736
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:45,430
The Sirens' island soon came into view.

1737
02:31:45,430 --> 02:31:51,590
We saw three strange women on the island,
with beautiful human faces but the bodies

1738
02:31:51,590 --> 02:31:53,850
of birds.

1739
02:31:53,850 --> 02:32:00,819
They started their magical song, and it was
the most beautiful music in the world.

1740
02:32:00,819 --> 02:32:05,229
I was filled with desire to hear more.

1741
02:32:05,229 --> 02:32:10,930
When they asked me to come to them, I wanted
to with all my heart.

1742
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:16,250
I ordered my men to untie me, but of course
they could not hear.

1743
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:21,279
I tried to break free, but they tied me more
tightly.

1744
02:32:21,279 --> 02:32:27,630
Sadly, I watched the men take me further and
further from the Sirens' island.

1745
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:33,439
Finally, they untied me and took out the wax
from their ears.

1746
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:37,470
With Circe's help, we were safe.

1747
02:32:37,470 --> 02:32:42,399
But there was no time to discuss what had
happened.

1748
02:32:42,399 --> 02:32:48,069
We saw rough water ahead, and heard the thunder
of waves against rocks.

1749
02:32:48,069 --> 02:32:52,420
The crew were so frightened that the oars
fell from their hands.

1750
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:58,670
I walked around the ship, saying, "We have
met trouble before, my friends.

1751
02:32:58,670 --> 02:33:02,569
With my help, you escaped the Cyclops's cave.

1752
02:33:02,569 --> 02:33:05,830
Today you must follow my orders again.

1753
02:33:05,830 --> 02:33:11,170
We are going to go as close as possible to
the higher rock, keeping the ship away from

1754
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:13,050
the rough water.

1755
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:18,000
Stay at your oars and pull as hard as you
can."

1756
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,109
The crew obeyed.

1757
02:33:20,109 --> 02:33:25,850
I did not tell them about Scylla, because
fear of the monster would stop them from pulling

1758
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:28,260
on their oars.

1759
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:34,840
I stood at the front of the ship, hoping to
get the first view of those six long necks.

1760
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:41,140
I looked until my eyes grew tired, but I could
see nothing.

1761
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:49,590
Then, suddenly, Charybdis threw up the water
from the deep sea floor.

1762
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:56,600
Salt water fell down on us like rain, and
the top of the sea was like boiling water.

1763
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:01,800
Then she pulled the water down again, and
we could see the sand at the bottom of the

1764
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:03,479
sea.

1765
02:34:03,479 --> 02:34:06,410
My men were pale with fear.

1766
02:34:06,410 --> 02:34:13,689
Then, while everyone was looking at Charybdis,
Scylla stretched her necks down from her cave

1767
02:34:13,689 --> 02:34:18,189
and caught six of my strongest men in her
mouths.

1768
02:34:18,189 --> 02:34:23,819
Their arms and legs waved pitifully in the
air as they called for help.

1769
02:34:23,819 --> 02:34:26,940
But we could do nothing to save them.

1770
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:34,189
In seconds, the monster had carried them up
to her cave and started her terrible meal.

1771
02:34:34,189 --> 02:34:42,130
We continued sadly on our way, and soon we
saw the lovely island of Thrinacie.

1772
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:46,750
As we came near the beach, we could heard
the sound of cows.

1773
02:34:46,750 --> 02:34:52,820
I remembered the words of Teiresias and said,
"Listen carefully, my friends.

1774
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:58,070
In the Underworld, Teiresias warned me about
this island.

1775
02:34:58,070 --> 02:35:03,010
There is a greater danger here than any that
we have met before.

1776
02:35:03,010 --> 02:35:05,460
Sail past the island.

1777
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:08,060
We should not land."

1778
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:10,439
My men were very upset.

1779
02:35:10,439 --> 02:35:16,770
Eurylochus shouted, "Do you never get tired,
Odysseus?

1780
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:22,609
How can you tell us not to land here, after
everything that has happened today?

1781
02:35:22,609 --> 02:35:25,180
You must be made of iron!

1782
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:29,529
It is nearly sunset, and we are tired and
hungry.

1783
02:35:29,529 --> 02:35:36,380
If we continue past this island, we will be
at sea all night - there is no other land

1784
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:38,100
near here.

1785
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:41,490
And storms are always worse at night.

1786
02:35:41,490 --> 02:35:45,210
Do you really want the winds to destroy our
ship?

1787
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:47,729
You are crazy.

1788
02:35:47,729 --> 02:35:51,080
We should land here and cook our supper.

1789
02:35:51,080 --> 02:35:55,620
In the morning, we can go back to the open
sea."

1790
02:35:55,620 --> 02:36:01,319
The rest of the crew agreed with him, and
I realized that the gods had already decided

1791
02:36:01,319 --> 02:36:03,149
our fate.

1792
02:36:03,149 --> 02:36:08,649
"I am one against many, Eurylochus.

1793
02:36:08,649 --> 02:36:12,140
I cannot refuse your demands.

1794
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:18,510
But I ask every one of you to promise that
you will not harm the animals on the island.

1795
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:23,180
Sit peacefully and eat the food that Circe
has given us.

1796
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:32,460
If you eat anything else, I cannot save you
from a disastrous end."

1797
02:36:32,460 --> 02:36:39,109
When everyone on the ship had given me their
promise, we landed on the Sun-god's island.

1798
02:36:39,109 --> 02:36:44,699
We ate a good supper, but the conversation
kept returning to the men that Scylla had

1799
02:36:44,699 --> 02:36:46,529
taken from us.

1800
02:36:46,529 --> 02:36:55,659
During the night, a storm blew up, and in
the morning it was not safe to sail.

1801
02:36:55,659 --> 02:37:01,590
I called my companions to a meeting and said,
"We still have plenty of food on the ship.

1802
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:07,840
Keep your hands off the cows on this island,
or disaster will follow.

1803
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:15,649
They belong to the Sun-god, who can see everything
on his daily journey across the sky."

1804
02:37:15,649 --> 02:37:18,470
The men agreed willingly.

1805
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:21,550
But the storm did not stop.

1806
02:37:21,550 --> 02:37:29,149
For a whole month it blew, and we were unable
to leave the island.

1807
02:37:29,149 --> 02:37:34,520
While our bread and wine lasted, the men obeyed
my orders.

1808
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:40,739
When there was nothing more to eat, they went
fishing and caught birds from the trees, but

1809
02:37:40,739 --> 02:37:43,660
they were still hungry.

1810
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:49,189
I hoped that one of the gods would take pity
on us and show me a way to escape.

1811
02:37:49,189 --> 02:37:55,250
I found a quiet place, out of the wind, to
pray.

1812
02:37:55,250 --> 02:38:02,229
But when I had finished, the gods sent me
into a deep sleep.

1813
02:38:02,229 --> 02:38:06,979
While I slept, Eurylochus was causing trouble
down by the ship.

1814
02:38:06,979 --> 02:38:14,220
"No death is pleasant," he argued, "but a
death from hunger is the worst.

1815
02:38:14,220 --> 02:38:17,670
I say we should eat those cows.

1816
02:38:17,670 --> 02:38:23,409
We can sacrifice them to the gods, and promise
to give all our treasure to the Sun god when

1817
02:38:23,409 --> 02:38:26,109
we return to Ithaca.

1818
02:38:26,109 --> 02:38:30,470
If he is still angry with us, let him destroy
our ship.

1819
02:38:30,470 --> 02:38:36,810
A quick death at sea is easier than a slow
and painful one on this island."

1820
02:38:36,810 --> 02:38:39,630
The rest of the crew agreed to his plan.

1821
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:45,489
Quickly, they brought the cows together and
sacrificed them to the gods.

1822
02:38:45,489 --> 02:38:53,260
They had no wine to pour over the meat as
it cooked, so they used seawater instead.

1823
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:58,570
As I woke from my sleep, I smelled the meat
cooking on the fire.

1824
02:38:58,570 --> 02:39:04,090
"So the gods have decided to ruin me," I cried.

1825
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:08,770
"There is no hope for us now!"

1826
02:39:08,770 --> 02:39:14,270
High in the sky, the Sun god had seen my companions'
crime.

1827
02:39:14,270 --> 02:39:22,440
He went to Zeus in anger, saying, "Odysseus
and his followers have killed my fine cows.

1828
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:26,220
You must punish them, as they deserve.

1829
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:32,540
If you leave their actions unpunished, I will
disappear from the sky and shine on the dead

1830
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:35,120
in the Underworld."

1831
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:42,720
"Shine on us here on Olympus and on the world
of men," Zeus replied.

1832
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:47,800
"You can be sure that I will punish the criminals."

1833
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,520
This was their conversation on Olympus.

1834
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:57,930
Calypso heard about it from Hermes and later
reported it to me.

1835
02:39:57,930 --> 02:40:01,720
Down on the Sun god's island, the men were
frightened.

1836
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:05,529
They could already see the signs of the gods'
anger.

1837
02:40:05,529 --> 02:40:10,210
The skins of the dead animals were moving
magically around the beach, and the pieces

1838
02:40:10,210 --> 02:40:15,080
of meat on the fire were calling out to each
other like cows.

1839
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:18,720
But we could do nothing to change the situation.

1840
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:21,120
The cows were dead.

1841
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:24,399
The damage had been done.

1842
02:40:24,399 --> 02:40:28,449
For six days, the men ate the meat of the
Sun-god's cows.

1843
02:40:28,449 --> 02:40:34,850
On the seventh, the wind dropped and it was
safe to sail.

1844
02:40:34,850 --> 02:40:40,050
With fear in our hearts, we took our ship
out to sea.

1845
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:45,689
Almost immediately, a cloud formed above the
ship, making a dark shadow on the sea around

1846
02:40:45,689 --> 02:40:47,449
us.

1847
02:40:47,449 --> 02:40:49,819
Then came the wind.

1848
02:40:49,819 --> 02:40:53,180
With the force of a wild animal, it attacked
us.

1849
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:56,479
It pulled the sail from the ship in seconds.

1850
02:40:56,479 --> 02:41:01,960
Wood came crashing down onto the sailors below
and one man was knocked into the sea.

1851
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:06,950
Worse followed, as Zeus struck the ship with
lightning.

1852
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:10,939
The whole ship shook violently.

1853
02:41:10,939 --> 02:41:16,460
The men held on tightly, but one by one they
were thrown from the ship.

1854
02:41:16,460 --> 02:41:22,140
They were pulled this way and that in the
water until they went down under the waves

1855
02:41:22,140 --> 02:41:23,250
forever.

1856
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:27,040
I alone was left on board.

1857
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:33,040
But soon the strength of the enormous waves
broke the ship into pieces.

1858
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:40,680
Luckily, I managed to climb onto a broken
piece of wood, and I held on tightly.

1859
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:44,050
All night I was blown around by the wind.

1860
02:41:44,050 --> 02:41:51,300
At sunrise I saw that I had been driven back
to the rocks of Scylla and Charybdis.

1861
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:56,840
Charybdis was beginning to pull the waters
down and I was swept towards a great hole

1862
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:59,010
in the sea.

1863
02:41:59,010 --> 02:42:04,810
Just in time, I managed to catch a branch
of the tree that grew from the rock.

1864
02:42:04,810 --> 02:42:12,140
I could not get my feet onto the tree, but
I hung by my arms, hour after hour.

1865
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:14,760
Finally, my wait was over.

1866
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,790
Charybdis threw up the wood that had saved
me from the storm.

1867
02:42:18,790 --> 02:42:25,979
I let myself fall back into the sea, swam
to the wood and climbed back on.

1868
02:42:25,979 --> 02:42:32,449
Luckily, Scylla did not see me, because there
was nothing to protect me from her greedy

1869
02:42:32,449 --> 02:42:33,739
mouths.

1870
02:42:33,739 --> 02:42:40,910
'I was at sea for another nine days, until
the waves carried me to the shores of Calypso's

1871
02:42:40,910 --> 02:42:42,680
island.

1872
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:47,260
She was kind to me and gave me a home.

1873
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:54,619
But I have already told you about my life
with Calypso, good Phaeacians.

1874
02:42:54,619 --> 02:43:02,010
I have reached the end of my story.'

1875
02:43:02,010 --> 02:43:07,189
CHAPTER EIGHT
Coming Home

1876
02:43:07,189 --> 02:43:09,750
'Look around you, Odysseus.

1877
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:19,010
Do you not recognise this beach, those rocks,
and that tree on the hills above?'

1878
02:43:19,010 --> 02:43:27,220
When Odysseus had finished, the hall was silent
until Alcinous said, 'Odysseus, you have suffered

1879
02:43:27,220 --> 02:43:28,580
greatly.

1880
02:43:28,580 --> 02:43:34,689
But I am sure that you will reach home safely
now, with our help.'

1881
02:43:34,689 --> 02:43:37,330
Then he spoke to his Phaeacian guests.

1882
02:43:37,330 --> 02:43:43,810
'Friends,' he said, 'we have already given
our guests fine gifts, but does this man not

1883
02:43:43,810 --> 02:43:46,720
deserve more after all his troubles?

1884
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:52,670
Go now and bring him some more treasure from
your home.

1885
02:43:52,670 --> 02:43:58,979
Later we will ask the common people to pay
for these gifts; we do not want any man's

1886
02:43:58,979 --> 02:44:02,990
generosity to ruin him.'

1887
02:44:02,990 --> 02:44:10,069
The next day the Phaeacians came to the port
with their gifts of gold and silver, and Alcinous

1888
02:44:10,069 --> 02:44:15,210
himself helped to put the gifts safely on
the ship.

1889
02:44:15,210 --> 02:44:20,930
Then they all returned to the palace for more
food and music, as the voyage was not going

1890
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:23,080
to start until sunset.

1891
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:28,439
All day Odysseus kept looking at the sun.

1892
02:44:28,439 --> 02:44:35,420
He was like a farmer who has worked hard in
the fields all day; sunset is a welcome sight

1893
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:41,850
to a man with tired legs and an empty stomach
- it is the time to stop work and go home

1894
02:44:41,850 --> 02:44:43,880
for supper.

1895
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:48,510
In the same way, Odysseus welcomed sunset
that day.

1896
02:44:48,510 --> 02:44:56,800
As soon as the sun had sunk below the sea,
he said, 'Alcinous, great king, let me say

1897
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:59,140
goodbye.

1898
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:05,729
You have given me the two things that I most
wanted - valuable gifts and a crew to take

1899
02:45:05,729 --> 02:45:07,359
me home.

1900
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:13,170
I pray that the gods bring you and your family
all the happiness that you deserve, and keep

1901
02:45:13,170 --> 02:45:15,760
your people safe from harm.'

1902
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:23,420
Odysseus and the Phaeacians walked down to
the port, and the servants carried bread and

1903
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:26,140
wine for the voyage.

1904
02:45:26,140 --> 02:45:30,970
On the ship, a blanket was spread out for
Odysseus to sleep on.

1905
02:45:30,970 --> 02:45:36,780
Then, after praying to the gods, Odysseus
climbed on board.

1906
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:41,600
He lay down on the blanket and the crew sat
at their oars.

1907
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:49,400
As the ship left the port, Odysseus immediately
fell into a deep and peaceful sleep.

1908
02:45:49,400 --> 02:45:56,489
And now, like a team of four horses in a chariot
race, the ship raced through the water towards

1909
02:45:56,489 --> 02:45:58,270
Ithaca.

1910
02:45:58,270 --> 02:46:04,109
After a journey of magical speed, it arrived
on the coast of Ithaca just before sunrise.

1911
02:46:04,109 --> 02:46:08,619
The crew found a beach with a large cave beside
it.

1912
02:46:08,619 --> 02:46:15,250
There the Phaeacian oarsmen landed the ship
and lifted Odysseus, still asleep, onto the

1913
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:17,690
sand.

1914
02:46:17,690 --> 02:46:22,479
They took all his gifts from the ship and
piled them next to him.

1915
02:46:22,479 --> 02:46:26,750
Then they started their voyage home.

1916
02:46:26,750 --> 02:46:34,920
Athene threw a fog over the island of Ithaca,
so that no one noticed Odysseus before she

1917
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:38,649
could warn him of the dangers in his palace.

1918
02:46:38,649 --> 02:46:44,530
As a result, when Odysseus woke up he did
not recognise his homeland.

1919
02:46:44,530 --> 02:46:48,960
He jumped to his feet and cried, 'Oh no!

1920
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:52,029
Whose country have I come to this time?

1921
02:46:52,029 --> 02:46:56,069
Will they be kind hosts, or dangerous monsters?

1922
02:46:56,069 --> 02:46:58,970
Where can I keep my treasure safe?

1923
02:46:58,970 --> 02:47:02,739
And what were those dishonest Phaeacians thinking?

1924
02:47:02,739 --> 02:47:08,000
They promised that they would take me home
to Ithaca, but instead they have left me in

1925
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,699
this strange place.

1926
02:47:09,699 --> 02:47:13,830
Let Zeus punish them for breaking their promise.

1927
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:18,720
I should look at my treasure too, to check
that they have not stolen anything.'

1928
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:26,080
He checked his gifts carefully, but none were
missing.

1929
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:32,500
Just then, Athene came to him, disguised as
a good-looking young farmworker.

1930
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:38,720
Odysseus was very happy to see that the people
of the island were not monsters, and said,

1931
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:40,819
'Good morning, friend.

1932
02:47:40,819 --> 02:47:44,090
You are the first person that I have met in
this land.

1933
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:46,600
Please help me.

1934
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:50,010
I need to find a safe place for my treasure.

1935
02:47:50,010 --> 02:47:52,210
And I need to know where I am.'

1936
02:47:52,210 --> 02:47:56,940
'I am surprised that you do not know this
land.

1937
02:47:56,940 --> 02:48:01,820
It is famous in countries far west and far
east of here.

1938
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:09,229
It is rocky - not a good place for horses
- but it has good farmland and produces fine

1939
02:48:09,229 --> 02:48:11,160
sheep and cows.

1940
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:17,609
Yes, even far away in Troy they know the name
of Ithaca.'

1941
02:48:17,609 --> 02:48:25,720
Odysseus's heart filled with happiness when
he heard that lovely name, but just in time

1942
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:28,000
he remembered to be careful.

1943
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:33,710
'Of course,' he replied, 'even in Crete we
have heard of Ithaca.

1944
02:48:33,710 --> 02:48:37,870
Crete has been my home until now.

1945
02:48:37,870 --> 02:48:43,760
But the king's son tried to take from me all
the treasure that I won at Troy.

1946
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:45,739
It was very unfair.

1947
02:48:45,739 --> 02:48:50,189
I had only one choice - to kill him.

1948
02:48:50,189 --> 02:48:55,159
But when he was dead, I could not live safely
in Crete.

1949
02:48:55,159 --> 02:48:59,090
So I took the first ship that I could find.

1950
02:48:59,090 --> 02:49:06,320
We were aiming for Pylos, but the wind was
too strong and we were driven here instead.

1951
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:09,170
Last night we slept on this beach.

1952
02:49:09,170 --> 02:49:13,529
When I woke in the morning, the ship and its
crew had gone.'

1953
02:49:13,529 --> 02:49:21,619
Athene smiled at Odysseus's story, then changed
into her true form.

1954
02:49:21,619 --> 02:49:27,699
Odysseus stared in wonder at the beautiful
goddess in front of him.

1955
02:49:27,699 --> 02:49:34,199
'So even in your homeland you have not given
up your tricks, Odysseus!

1956
02:49:34,199 --> 02:49:36,779
You and I are so similar.

1957
02:49:36,779 --> 02:49:43,399
You are the cleverest and most resourceful
person in the world of men, and I am the cleverest

1958
02:49:43,399 --> 02:49:45,569
and most resourceful of the gods.

1959
02:49:45,569 --> 02:49:52,580
But, though you are clever, you did not realize
that the goddess Athene was beside you through

1960
02:49:52,580 --> 02:49:54,880
all your adventures.

1961
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:59,630
I made the Phaeacians look after you kindly.

1962
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:03,920
And now I will help you again.'

1963
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:10,770
'It is hard to recognise you in all your disguises,
great goddess,' Odysseus replied.

1964
02:50:10,770 --> 02:50:18,670
'I remember your kindness at Troy, but have
I really had much help from you since then?

1965
02:50:18,670 --> 02:50:24,670
Where were you when the Greek ships were separated
because of arguments and storms?

1966
02:50:24,670 --> 02:50:27,830
Where were you when my companions were lost
at sea?'

1967
02:50:27,830 --> 02:50:34,510
'You must understand that I could not act
against Poseidon, who was very angry about

1968
02:50:34,510 --> 02:50:37,779
your treatment of his son, the Cyclops.'

1969
02:50:37,779 --> 02:50:45,380
'But tell me, goddess, and I pray that you
answer me honestly: is this really Ithaca,

1970
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:51,229
or were your words intended to make me suffer
even more?'

1971
02:50:51,229 --> 02:50:53,210
'Look around you, Odysseus.

1972
02:50:53,210 --> 02:51:01,140
Do you not recognise this beach, those rocks,
and that tree on the hills above?'

1973
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:06,649
As she spoke, she lifted the fog that was
hiding the land from view.

1974
02:51:06,649 --> 02:51:09,720
Odysseus recognised it at last.

1975
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:14,000
He threw himself down on the ground and kissed
the sand.

1976
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,960
'Come,' said the goddess.

1977
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:21,189
'We must hide your treasure in that cave over
there.'

1978
02:51:21,189 --> 02:51:28,250
When everything was safely in the cave, Athene
warned him about the situation in the palace.

1979
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:30,960
'Penelope is surrounded by suitors.

1980
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:34,859
They are arrogant and greedy men, who will
do anything.

1981
02:51:34,859 --> 02:51:39,330
They are even trying to murder your son Telemachus.

1982
02:51:39,330 --> 02:51:43,670
When it is time to fight them, I will be at
your side,' she said.

1983
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:48,189
'But at the moment they must not know about
your return.

1984
02:51:48,189 --> 02:51:54,770
I will disguise you as a man so old and poorly
dressed that even your wife will not recognise

1985
02:51:54,770 --> 02:51:56,819
you.

1986
02:51:56,819 --> 02:52:00,470
Go and stay with Eumaeus, the pig farmer.

1987
02:52:00,470 --> 02:52:06,670
He is still loyal to you and Penelope, and
he loves Telemachus like a son.

1988
02:52:06,670 --> 02:52:09,820
He can give you the news from the town.

1989
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:15,280
And I will bring Telemachus home from Sparta,
where he has been asking Menelaus for news

1990
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:16,890
of you.'

1991
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:23,069
Athene used her magic to change Odysseus into
a weak old man.

1992
02:52:23,069 --> 02:52:29,319
His skin hung loose on his body, his hair
was white, and his clothes were dirty pieces

1993
02:52:29,319 --> 02:52:31,700
of cloth.

1994
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:40,710
Then she disappeared suddenly, hurrying to
Telemachus in Sparta.

1995
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:46,159
Odysseus followed a path up to the hills and
the home of Eumaeus, the pig farmer, the most

1996
02:52:46,159 --> 02:52:50,370
loyal of all Odysseus's farmworkers.

1997
02:52:50,370 --> 02:52:54,899
He found Eumaeus near his hut, busy with his
pigs.

1998
02:52:54,899 --> 02:52:59,890
There were eight hundred on his farm, although
their number was reduced every day by the

1999
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:02,340
enormous meals at the palace.

2000
02:53:02,340 --> 02:53:08,380
The guard dogs saw Odysseus first and ran
towards him.

2001
02:53:08,380 --> 02:53:13,700
Luckily, Eumaeus called them back before they
attacked the stranger.

2002
02:53:13,700 --> 02:53:19,100
'Those dogs almost pulled you to pieces, old
man,' he said.

2003
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:22,130
'Then I would have even more worries.

2004
02:53:22,130 --> 02:53:25,330
The situation is bad enough now.

2005
02:53:25,330 --> 02:53:31,409
I spend my days making my master's pigs fat
so that other men can eat them.

2006
02:53:31,409 --> 02:53:38,359
But my good, kind master is probably dying
of hunger, lost in a foreign land, or perhaps

2007
02:53:38,359 --> 02:53:40,460
already dead.

2008
02:53:40,460 --> 02:53:42,180
But come inside.

2009
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:47,680
When you have had some food and wine, you
can tell me about yourself.'

2010
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:52,790
Inside the hut, Eumaeus offered his guest
a seat on a pile of sticks with a sheepskin

2011
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:54,600
thrown over it.

2012
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:59,439
'Thank you for this warm welcome,' said Odysseus.

2013
02:53:59,439 --> 02:54:04,400
'I hope that the gods are kind to you.'

2014
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:11,600
Eumaeus prepared some simple food and gave
it to Odysseus, saying, 'It is not much, I

2015
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:12,689
am afraid.

2016
02:54:12,689 --> 02:54:18,090
But we have little left after we have sent
all our best pigs to those arrogant men in

2017
02:54:18,090 --> 02:54:19,880
the palace.

2018
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:26,310
They want to marry my absent master's wife,
but they do not behave like future husbands.

2019
02:54:26,310 --> 02:54:30,069
Instead, they sit around the palace all day.

2020
02:54:30,069 --> 02:54:36,700
They kill several pigs every night and drink
my master's wine like water.

2021
02:54:36,700 --> 02:54:41,220
They must know that my master will never return,
because they fear no punishment for their

2022
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:45,229
unlawful behavior.'

2023
02:54:45,229 --> 02:54:51,330
Odysseus ate the food gratefully, thinking
about what he would do to those suitors.

2024
02:54:51,330 --> 02:54:58,680
When he had finished, he asked, 'So who is
your absent master?

2025
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:01,800
You seem to have a very good opinion of him.

2026
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:05,260
Perhaps I have met him on my travels.'

2027
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:08,560
'His name is Odysseus.

2028
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:15,250
It was Odysseus, I should say, because he
is now lying dead somewhere.

2029
02:55:15,250 --> 02:55:20,120
He was the kindest of masters and the best
of men.

2030
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:24,680
He owned land here on Ithaca and on the mainland.

2031
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:29,560
He was rich in pigs and cows and sheep, and
in treasure too.

2032
02:55:29,560 --> 02:55:35,960
But the suitors are destroying his property
day by day, and soon there will be nothing

2033
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:37,750
left.

2034
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:41,109
My heart aches when I think of it.

2035
02:55:41,109 --> 02:55:44,270
But tell me, stranger, who you are.

2036
02:55:44,270 --> 02:55:46,810
What has brought you to this island?'

2037
02:55:46,810 --> 02:55:51,689
Odysseus told him that he had been a prince
of Crete.

2038
02:55:51,689 --> 02:55:56,109
He had had an argument with his brother and
had to leave his homeland.

2039
02:55:56,109 --> 02:56:02,670
After many years of travel and a lot of bad
luck, he now owned nothing in the world except

2040
02:56:02,670 --> 02:56:04,899
the clothes that he was wearing.

2041
02:56:04,899 --> 02:56:09,489
'I met Odysseus once,' he added.

2042
02:56:09,489 --> 02:56:13,949
'He stayed at our palace in Crete on the way
to Troy.

2043
02:56:13,949 --> 02:56:18,580
And a few days ago I heard talk of him again.

2044
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:24,210
There was a ship in Thesprotia waiting to
carry him home.

2045
02:56:24,210 --> 02:56:28,090
The crew were expecting to start their voyage
this week.'

2046
02:56:28,090 --> 02:56:33,460
'I am sorry for all your troubles, old man,'
the pig farmer replied.

2047
02:56:33,460 --> 02:56:38,199
'But I cannot believe your story about Odysseus.

2048
02:56:38,199 --> 02:56:41,369
Why are you telling such lies?

2049
02:56:41,369 --> 02:56:47,290
Another man told me a similar story last year,
and travellers regularly upset Penelope with

2050
02:56:47,290 --> 02:56:49,830
false information.

2051
02:56:49,830 --> 02:56:55,680
Odysseus never arrives, and only a fool now
believes that he will.'

2052
02:56:55,680 --> 02:57:03,890
'If my story proves false, you can throw me
from the highest rock on this island,' said

2053
02:57:03,890 --> 02:57:04,890
Odysseus.

2054
02:57:04,890 --> 02:57:10,380
'Zeus would soon punish a man who invited
a stranger into his home and then killed him

2055
02:57:10,380 --> 02:57:14,530
for lying,' replied Eumaeus.

2056
02:57:14,530 --> 02:57:19,840
They spent the evening in friendly conversation
in front of the fire.

2057
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:26,260
When it was time for sleep, Eumaeus lent Odysseus
a thick coat to use as a blanket.

2058
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:33,560
Then, always careful of his master's property,
he went out to sleep with the pigs, to protect

2059
02:57:33,560 --> 02:57:40,359
them from thieves and wild animals during
the night.

2060
02:57:40,359 --> 02:57:43,550
CHAPTER NINE
Telemachus Returns

2061
02:57:43,550 --> 02:57:48,279
'I am not a god,' replied Odysseus.

2062
02:57:48,279 --> 02:57:54,840
'But I am your father, who has been the cause
of so many problems for you.'

2063
02:57:54,840 --> 02:58:03,989
Athene now went to Sparta and found Telemachus
and Peisistratus in the palace of King Menelaus.

2064
02:58:03,989 --> 02:58:11,149
Peisistratus was asleep, but Telemachus was
lying awake, worrying about his absent father

2065
02:58:11,149 --> 02:58:14,810
and the problem of the suitors.

2066
02:58:14,810 --> 02:58:21,770
Athene stood near him and said, 'Go back to
your palace and keep it safe from the greedy

2067
02:58:21,770 --> 02:58:23,229
suitors.

2068
02:58:23,229 --> 02:58:29,250
Your mother's father has told her to marry
Eurymachus, since he is the richest of her

2069
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:30,250
suitors.

2070
02:58:30,250 --> 02:58:35,520
If you do not go home soon, you will return
to an empty house.

2071
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:38,100
But be careful.

2072
02:58:38,100 --> 02:58:42,620
The suitors have sent a ship to attack you
on your voyage home.

2073
02:58:42,620 --> 02:58:48,330
They are waiting for you between Ithaca and
the coast of Samos, with swords in their hands

2074
02:58:48,330 --> 02:58:51,409
and murder in their hearts.

2075
02:58:51,409 --> 02:58:57,529
Make sure that you go home a different way,
and sail at night so that they cannot see

2076
02:58:57,529 --> 02:58:59,720
your ship.

2077
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:05,910
Get off the ship at a quiet part of the coast
and go straight to Eumaeus's pig farm, while

2078
02:59:05,910 --> 02:59:12,300
your crew sail to the port and spread the
news of your return.'

2079
02:59:12,300 --> 02:59:17,490
When she had delivered her message, she went
back to Mount Olympus.

2080
02:59:17,490 --> 02:59:24,300
Telemachus woke Peisistratus with a gentle
kick and said, 'Come, my friend, we must get

2081
02:59:24,300 --> 02:59:27,159
the chariot ready and be on our way.'

2082
02:59:27,159 --> 02:59:32,199
'We should leave soon, I agree, Telemachus.

2083
02:59:32,199 --> 02:59:35,140
But it is the middle of the night.

2084
02:59:35,140 --> 02:59:40,989
We cannot drive in complete darkness, and
what would Menelaus think if we rushed away

2085
02:59:40,989 --> 02:59:43,640
like thieves in the night?

2086
02:59:43,640 --> 02:59:47,250
Can our journey not wait until morning?'

2087
02:59:47,250 --> 02:59:53,380
Telemachus agreed to stay in Sparta for a
few more hours.

2088
02:59:53,380 --> 02:59:57,960
When daylight came, he went to speak to his
host.

2089
02:59:57,960 --> 03:00:02,920
'Menelaus,' he said, 'I must go home.

2090
03:00:02,920 --> 03:00:05,949
But I will never forget your kindness to me.'

2091
03:00:05,949 --> 03:00:11,790
'I will not keep you here against your wishes,'
replied the king.

2092
03:00:11,790 --> 03:00:14,920
'But give me time to bring you some gifts.

2093
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:19,140
And enjoy one last meal with us before you
leave.'

2094
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:25,859
Menelaus gave him the bowl of fine silver
that he had promised him the day before.

2095
03:00:25,859 --> 03:00:28,420
Queen Helen added a present of her own.

2096
03:00:28,420 --> 03:00:33,109
'I made this dress myself,' she told Telemachus.

2097
03:00:33,109 --> 03:00:38,330
'It is for your future wife to wear on your
wedding day.'

2098
03:00:38,330 --> 03:00:44,710
They then had some food, and after the meal
Telemachus and Peisistratus climbed into their

2099
03:00:44,710 --> 03:00:46,090
chariot.

2100
03:00:46,090 --> 03:00:50,890
'Goodbye, young friends,' said Menelaus.

2101
03:00:50,890 --> 03:00:52,840
'Give my good wishes to Nestor.'

2102
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:57,069
'We will,' replied Telemachus.

2103
03:00:57,069 --> 03:01:03,270
'I only hope that one day I can give your
good wishes to my father too, and tell him

2104
03:01:03,270 --> 03:01:06,540
of your kindness to me.'

2105
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:13,180
As he spoke, an eagle flew across the sky,
carrying a chicken from a local farm in its

2106
03:01:13,180 --> 03:01:15,180
feet.

2107
03:01:15,180 --> 03:01:21,369
Some farmworkers were chasing the eagle, but
it gave a cry and flew out to sea, far beyond

2108
03:01:21,369 --> 03:01:22,590
their reach.

2109
03:01:22,590 --> 03:01:26,540
'This was a sign from the gods,' said Helen.

2110
03:01:26,540 --> 03:01:29,750
'And its message seems clear.

2111
03:01:29,750 --> 03:01:35,140
Just as the eagle attacked the chicken, Odysseus
will attack the suitors when he finds his

2112
03:01:35,140 --> 03:01:36,859
way home.

2113
03:01:36,859 --> 03:01:41,680
Or perhaps he is already in Ithaca, planning
their death.'

2114
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:45,410
'I pray that you are right,' said Telemachus.

2115
03:01:45,410 --> 03:01:52,310
And with a shout to the horses, he started
the chariot.

2116
03:01:52,310 --> 03:01:56,690
After a smooth journey, they reached Pylos
the next day.

2117
03:01:56,690 --> 03:02:00,729
Telemachus said goodbye to Peisistratus at
the port.

2118
03:02:00,729 --> 03:02:05,420
'I am sorry that I cannot say goodbye to your
father too.

2119
03:02:05,420 --> 03:02:08,180
But I have no time to go to the palace.

2120
03:02:08,180 --> 03:02:09,650
I need to get home urgently.'

2121
03:02:09,650 --> 03:02:18,660
As the crew carried the gifts from Menelaus
onto the ship, a stranger came to Telemachus.

2122
03:02:18,660 --> 03:02:22,820
'Can you take me with you?' he asked.

2123
03:02:22,820 --> 03:02:28,479
'In Argos, my homeland, I have enemies who
are trying to kill me.

2124
03:02:28,479 --> 03:02:31,050
I think they have followed me here.'

2125
03:02:31,050 --> 03:02:35,040
'You are welcome to come with us,' replied
Telemachus.

2126
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:40,399
'We are going to Ithaca, and there you can
stay as my guest.'

2127
03:02:40,399 --> 03:02:45,930
'I am grateful for your kindness, good friend,'
said the stranger.

2128
03:02:45,930 --> 03:02:50,040
'My name is Theoclymenus.

2129
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:52,830
In Argos I am a famous prophet.'

2130
03:02:52,830 --> 03:03:01,590
They all climbed on board, and the crew pulled
on their oars until Pylos was far behind them.

2131
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:08,450
In open sea, they put up the sail and the
wind carried them quickly towards Ithaca.

2132
03:03:08,450 --> 03:03:13,229
As Telemachus stared out at the waves, he
wondered what would happen at the end of the

2133
03:03:13,229 --> 03:03:14,430
voyage.

2134
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:23,500
Would he get home alive, or would the suitors
succeed in their plan to murder him?

2135
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:29,619
At the same time, Odysseus was having supper
with Eumaeus in the hut.

2136
03:03:29,619 --> 03:03:36,180
Wanting to test his host's loyalty, he said,
'I cannot take advantage of your kindness

2137
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:38,399
any longer.

2138
03:03:38,399 --> 03:03:42,890
Tomorrow I will go to town and ask for work
at the palace.

2139
03:03:42,890 --> 03:03:48,340
And I can tell Queen Penelope that her husband
will soon be home.'

2140
03:03:48,340 --> 03:03:50,260
'No, no!'

2141
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:52,530
replied Eumaeus.

2142
03:03:52,530 --> 03:03:57,460
'Penelope has listened to too many stories
about Odysseus already.

2143
03:03:57,460 --> 03:03:59,790
You would do no good.

2144
03:03:59,790 --> 03:04:03,069
You would just upset her.

2145
03:04:03,069 --> 03:04:07,239
And the suitors in the palace will not want
you as their servant.

2146
03:04:07,239 --> 03:04:14,290
They are surrounded only by good-looking young
men with oil in their hair and handsome clothes.

2147
03:04:14,290 --> 03:04:19,729
You might die a violent death if you went
to the palace in search of work.

2148
03:04:19,729 --> 03:04:24,750
No, it is better to stay here with me.

2149
03:04:24,750 --> 03:04:30,319
When my master's son, Telemachus, returns
from Pylos, he will give you some new clothes

2150
03:04:30,319 --> 03:04:33,250
and send you wherever you want.'

2151
03:04:33,250 --> 03:04:38,940
'Your kindness continues, Eumaeus,' said his
guest.

2152
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:43,720
'I will wait for Telemachus s return as you
suggest.

2153
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:50,180
But tell me, while I am here, about your masters
family.

2154
03:04:50,180 --> 03:04:53,260
Does he have a father or mother still living?'

2155
03:04:53,260 --> 03:05:00,960
'His father, Laertes, is still alive, but
life brings him no happiness.

2156
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:07,810
He lost his son when Odysseus went to Troy,
and then his dear wife died of a broken heart

2157
03:05:07,810 --> 03:05:10,930
because of Odysseus's absence.

2158
03:05:10,930 --> 03:05:13,260
She was a lovely woman.

2159
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:19,640
She was like a mother to me when I first came
to Ithaca - I grew up in her house.'

2160
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:25,989
'So you were still quite young when you came
to Ithaca,' said Odysseus.

2161
03:05:25,989 --> 03:05:28,050
'What happened to you?

2162
03:05:28,050 --> 03:05:32,899
How were you separated from your home and
family?'

2163
03:05:32,899 --> 03:05:38,640
'Well, I was born in the far land of Syrie.

2164
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:43,060
My father, Ctesius, was its king.

2165
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:50,149
One day a ship arrived from Phoenicia with
lots of jewels and pretty things for sale.

2166
03:05:50,149 --> 03:05:53,569
One of my father's servants was Phoenician.

2167
03:05:53,569 --> 03:05:59,199
As a young girl, she had been stolen from
her homeland by criminals.

2168
03:05:59,199 --> 03:06:05,820
Now she was a tall, beautiful woman, good
at her work, but not very sensible.

2169
03:06:05,820 --> 03:06:10,560
Well, this servant fell in love with one of
the Phoenician sailors.

2170
03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:18,000
He offered to take her home with him to Phoenicia
and she was very excited at the idea.

2171
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:24,109
But to pay for her voyage the sailors asked
her to steal some gold from my father's palace.

2172
03:06:24,109 --> 03:06:31,180
She agreed willingly, saying, "There is something
else that I can give you too.

2173
03:06:31,180 --> 03:06:35,119
At the palace I look after my master's young
son.

2174
03:06:35,119 --> 03:06:39,529
He is a clever boy and he follows me everywhere.

2175
03:06:39,529 --> 03:06:44,540
If I brought him too, you could sell him for
a high price at any foreign port."

2176
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:48,300
'The plan was made.

2177
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:54,870
She left the palace secretly with a bag full
of gold cups, and I, innocent child, went

2178
03:06:54,870 --> 03:06:56,149
with her.

2179
03:06:56,149 --> 03:07:02,210
But a few days into our voyage, the servant
died suddenly on the ship.

2180
03:07:02,210 --> 03:07:07,810
Her body was thrown to the fishes and I was
left friendless.

2181
03:07:07,810 --> 03:07:12,409
Later we came to Ithaca and Laertes bought
me from the Phoenicians.'

2182
03:07:12,409 --> 03:07:18,800
'What a strange story of bad luck,' said Odysseus.

2183
03:07:18,800 --> 03:07:21,250
'I am sorry for your troubles.

2184
03:07:21,250 --> 03:07:28,109
But you had good luck too, since you were
bought by a kind master.'

2185
03:07:28,109 --> 03:07:33,850
Their conversation continued far into the
night, until it was time to sleep.

2186
03:07:33,850 --> 03:07:38,510
At the same time, Telemachus had had a lucky
night.

2187
03:07:38,510 --> 03:07:45,010
His ship was near the coast of Ithaca, and
the crew had not seen the murderous suitors.

2188
03:07:45,010 --> 03:07:48,490
'Land on that beach,' he said to the men.

2189
03:07:48,490 --> 03:07:52,670
'I am going to get off there and visit my
farms.

2190
03:07:52,670 --> 03:07:55,990
Take the ship to the city without me.'

2191
03:07:55,990 --> 03:08:04,060
He turned to one of the oarsmen, his loyal
friend Peiraeus, and said, 'Could you give

2192
03:08:04,060 --> 03:08:06,800
Theoclymenus a bed for the night?

2193
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:10,649
I will meet you in the city tomorrow.'

2194
03:08:10,649 --> 03:08:15,520
The crew took the ship onto the beach and
Telemachus jumped out.

2195
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:22,939
He watched his companions as they sailed towards
the city, then started along the path to Eumaeus's

2196
03:08:22,939 --> 03:08:24,689
hut.

2197
03:08:24,689 --> 03:08:31,180
Eumaeus and Odysseus were preparing breakfast
when Telemachus appeared in the doorway.

2198
03:08:31,180 --> 03:08:38,760
Eumaeus jumped up in surprise, and the bowls
in his hands fell noisily to the floor.

2199
03:08:38,760 --> 03:08:43,699
He threw his arms around his young master
like a loving father welcoming back his dear

2200
03:08:43,699 --> 03:08:46,050
son after many years abroad.

2201
03:08:46,050 --> 03:08:48,380
'You are back, then, Telemachus!

2202
03:08:48,380 --> 03:08:55,620
And I thought that I would never see you again
after you sailed to Pylos.

2203
03:08:55,620 --> 03:09:01,400
Come in, come in, dear child, and let me look
at you.

2204
03:09:01,400 --> 03:09:06,210
I do not see you often enough here on the
farm.'

2205
03:09:06,210 --> 03:09:09,939
'It is good to see you too, Eumaeus.

2206
03:09:09,939 --> 03:09:13,510
I have come here to ask for news from the
palace.

2207
03:09:13,510 --> 03:09:19,909
Is my mother still there, or has she married
again and gone to her new husband's home?'

2208
03:09:19,909 --> 03:09:24,180
'She is still at the palace,' said the pig
farmer.

2209
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:28,699
'And she still spends most of her days in
tears.'

2210
03:09:28,699 --> 03:09:34,460
Telemachus came into the hut, and Odysseus
stood up to give him his seat.

2211
03:09:34,460 --> 03:09:37,010
But Telemachus stopped him.

2212
03:09:37,010 --> 03:09:40,899
'Please, stranger, do not get up.

2213
03:09:40,899 --> 03:09:44,840
I am sure that there is something else for
me to sit on.'

2214
03:09:44,840 --> 03:09:52,750
Eumaeus made another seat of sticks and sheepskin,
and Telemachus sat down next to his father,

2215
03:09:52,750 --> 03:09:53,830
Odysseus.

2216
03:09:53,830 --> 03:09:58,159
'So who is your guest, Eumaeus?' he asked.

2217
03:09:58,159 --> 03:10:03,790
'He is from Crete,' replied the servant, 'but
he cannot go back there.

2218
03:10:03,790 --> 03:10:07,420
I am hoping that you can look after him at
the palace.'

2219
03:10:07,420 --> 03:10:08,939
'The palace?'

2220
03:10:08,939 --> 03:10:10,970
cried Telemachus.

2221
03:10:10,970 --> 03:10:12,900
'But how can I?

2222
03:10:12,900 --> 03:10:18,159
My mother is usually too upset to receive
visitors, and the suitors are a dangerous

2223
03:10:18,159 --> 03:10:19,430
crowd.

2224
03:10:19,430 --> 03:10:23,819
I can do little to protect him against so
many.

2225
03:10:23,819 --> 03:10:26,930
I am happy to give him food and new clothes.

2226
03:10:26,930 --> 03:10:30,619
And I will send him wherever he wants to go.

2227
03:10:30,619 --> 03:10:35,069
But while he is in Ithaca he should stay here
with you.

2228
03:10:35,069 --> 03:10:38,390
It will be safer for him here.

2229
03:10:38,390 --> 03:10:44,569
But now, Eumaeus, old friend, can I ask you
to take a message to my mother?

2230
03:10:44,569 --> 03:10:47,580
Tell her that I am back from Pylos.

2231
03:10:47,580 --> 03:10:50,020
Tell no one except her.

2232
03:10:50,020 --> 03:10:53,329
There are many people who are trying to harm
me.'

2233
03:10:53,329 --> 03:10:56,090
Eumaeus wasted no time.

2234
03:10:56,090 --> 03:11:00,720
He left the hut immediately in the direction
of the palace.

2235
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:03,029
Athene saw him go.

2236
03:11:03,029 --> 03:11:09,229
She appeared suddenly at the door of the hut,
although only Odysseus could see her.

2237
03:11:09,229 --> 03:11:16,180
Odysseus followed her outside, where she said,
'It is time to tell your son who you are.

2238
03:11:16,180 --> 03:11:21,300
Together you must start planning the fate
of those men in your palace.'

2239
03:11:21,300 --> 03:11:26,090
As she spoke, she took away his disguise of
old age.

2240
03:11:26,090 --> 03:11:32,060
His strength and good looks returned; his
beard grew dark on his chin; and he was wearing

2241
03:11:32,060 --> 03:11:34,949
fine new clothes.

2242
03:11:34,949 --> 03:11:40,880
Then the goddess disappeared, and Odysseus
went back into the hut.

2243
03:11:40,880 --> 03:11:45,859
Telemachus looked at him now in wonder.

2244
03:11:45,859 --> 03:11:50,430
'Stranger, you look completely different.

2245
03:11:50,430 --> 03:11:54,590
Only the gods can change their appearance
in this way.

2246
03:11:54,590 --> 03:11:58,229
Which god are you, and what can I do for you?'

2247
03:11:58,229 --> 03:12:02,500
'I am not a god,' replied Odysseus.

2248
03:12:02,500 --> 03:12:10,010
'But I am your father, who has been the cause
of so many problems for you.'

2249
03:12:10,010 --> 03:12:13,930
He kissed his son, and tears ran down his
face.

2250
03:12:13,930 --> 03:12:16,859
But Telemachus stepped back from him.

2251
03:12:16,859 --> 03:12:20,479
'You are not my father,' he said.

2252
03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:24,229
'A god is playing a cruel trick on me.

2253
03:12:24,229 --> 03:12:28,479
No man can change his appearance as you have
just done.'

2254
03:12:28,479 --> 03:12:32,610
'I promise you that this is no trick.

2255
03:12:32,610 --> 03:12:39,119
My disguise was the work of Athene, who has
been a great help to me in my troubles.'

2256
03:12:39,119 --> 03:12:43,180
Telemachus was satisfied by this answer.

2257
03:12:43,180 --> 03:12:47,100
He threw his arms around his father's neck.

2258
03:12:47,100 --> 03:12:52,319
Together they cried tears of great sadness
and great happiness.

2259
03:12:52,319 --> 03:12:57,810
This was the moment that they had both dreamt
about for so many years.

2260
03:12:57,810 --> 03:13:01,010
'But how did you get to Ithaca?'

2261
03:13:01,010 --> 03:13:03,700
Telemachus asked finally.

2262
03:13:03,700 --> 03:13:06,760
'In a Phaeacian ship.

2263
03:13:06,760 --> 03:13:11,540
I have a great pile of treasure, which is
hidden in a cave by the beach.

2264
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:13,890
But we should waste no time.

2265
03:13:13,890 --> 03:13:17,800
We must plan the death of those suitors.

2266
03:13:17,800 --> 03:13:19,760
Tell me how many of them there are.

2267
03:13:19,760 --> 03:13:22,659
Then I can decide how to fight them.'

2268
03:13:22,659 --> 03:13:26,710
'There are more than a hundred suitors.

2269
03:13:26,710 --> 03:13:31,000
I know that you have a great reputation as
a soldier, Father.

2270
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:34,180
But we cannot possibly fight them alone.

2271
03:13:34,180 --> 03:13:37,210
We must think of some people who will fight
with us.'

2272
03:13:37,210 --> 03:13:42,069
'Athene and Zeus will fight with us,' his
father replied.

2273
03:13:42,069 --> 03:13:44,710
'Their help will be enough, I think.'

2274
03:13:44,710 --> 03:13:51,689
'If you are right, then the suitors have no
chance,' Telemachus agreed.

2275
03:13:51,689 --> 03:13:57,029
'Tomorrow,' continued Odysseus, you will go
back to the palace.

2276
03:13:57,029 --> 03:14:01,890
I will join you later in the day, disguised
again as an old man.

2277
03:14:01,890 --> 03:14:05,609
If the suitors are rough with me, do not worry.

2278
03:14:05,609 --> 03:14:08,580
Their day of judgment is coming.

2279
03:14:08,580 --> 03:14:16,829
But tell no one about my return - not my father
Laertes, or Eumaeus, or even your mother.

2280
03:14:16,829 --> 03:14:22,560
It must be a complete secret until we have
destroyed the suitors' power.'

2281
03:14:22,560 --> 03:14:28,040
'We must do that very soon, or Mother will
marry one of them.

2282
03:14:28,040 --> 03:14:31,579
Then it will be too late.'

2283
03:14:31,579 --> 03:14:38,570
As father and son discussed their plans, Telemachus's
crew arrived at the port in the city.

2284
03:14:38,570 --> 03:14:43,800
A messenger was sent to tell Penelope that
her son was safe.

2285
03:14:43,800 --> 03:14:48,880
This messenger arrived at the palace at the
same time as Eumaeus, and soon gave the queen

2286
03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:52,950
his message in front of all her servants.

2287
03:14:52,950 --> 03:14:57,909
In private, Eumaeus told her everything that
he knew.

2288
03:14:57,909 --> 03:15:03,970
Then he went back to his farm - to Telemachus
and Odysseus, who Athene had changed back

2289
03:15:03,970 --> 03:15:07,410
into an old man.

2290
03:15:07,410 --> 03:15:13,800
The news of Telemachus's return soon spread
to the suitors, who were very angry.

2291
03:15:13,800 --> 03:15:19,330
When Antinous's ship came into port, they
rushed to find out what had happened.

2292
03:15:19,330 --> 03:15:23,540
'The lucky young fool!' shouted Antinous.

2293
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:31,449
'My people were looking for him all along
the coast, but he managed to get past us.

2294
03:15:31,449 --> 03:15:35,850
We must find another way to kill him, and
do it fast.

2295
03:15:35,850 --> 03:15:43,000
If we do not, he will call another meeting
and turn the people of Ithaca against us.

2296
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:48,170
They will not be happy that we have tried
to murder their prince.

2297
03:15:48,170 --> 03:15:53,680
If we are not careful, we will soon be thrown
off this island.

2298
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:56,130
We have no choice.

2299
03:15:56,130 --> 03:16:02,250
We must kill him now, before it is too late.'

2300
03:16:02,250 --> 03:16:04,869
Silence followed this speech.

2301
03:16:04,869 --> 03:16:09,619
Finally, Amphinomus stood up to speak.

2302
03:16:09,619 --> 03:16:14,960
He was a more thoughtful man than the rest,
one of the few suitors who Penelope liked

2303
03:16:14,960 --> 03:16:16,510
to talk to.

2304
03:16:16,510 --> 03:16:23,649
'My friends,' he said now, 'I cannot agree
to this murder.

2305
03:16:23,649 --> 03:16:28,819
It is wrong to kill a prince, unless the gods
have given clear signs that they want him

2306
03:16:28,819 --> 03:16:30,210
dead.

2307
03:16:30,210 --> 03:16:32,930
We should wait for those signs.

2308
03:16:32,930 --> 03:16:36,050
Until then, we should do nothing.'

2309
03:16:36,050 --> 03:16:38,649
The other suitors agreed with him.

2310
03:16:38,649 --> 03:16:43,960
For the moment, Telemachus was safe.

2311
03:16:43,960 --> 03:16:48,760
CHAPTER TEN
Odysseus at the Palace

2312
03:16:48,760 --> 03:16:57,430
She quickly looked up at the stranger above
her, and she knew - her master had returned.

2313
03:16:57,430 --> 03:17:02,390
The next morning, Telemachus prepared to visit
his mother at the palace.

2314
03:17:02,390 --> 03:17:09,210
As he left Eumaeus's hut, he said to the pig
farmer, After I have gone, take our visitor

2315
03:17:09,210 --> 03:17:10,680
to the city.

2316
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:14,370
He can ask the people there for food.'

2317
03:17:14,370 --> 03:17:22,760
Telemachus met the prophet Theoclymenus in
town, then walked with him to the palace.

2318
03:17:22,760 --> 03:17:28,170
Loyal old Eurycleia was the first to see her
young master, and she ran up to him with a

2319
03:17:28,170 --> 03:17:30,359
cry of happiness.

2320
03:17:30,359 --> 03:17:36,350
The other servants followed, and finally Penelope
came out of her room.

2321
03:17:36,350 --> 03:17:40,260
Tears ran down her face as she threw her arms
around him.

2322
03:17:40,260 --> 03:17:43,500
'You are back, my child!

2323
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:47,800
And I thought I would never see you again
after your secret departure.

2324
03:17:47,800 --> 03:17:53,079
But come, tell me what you learnt on your
voyage.'

2325
03:17:53,079 --> 03:17:57,069
'Well, we went first to Pylos.

2326
03:17:57,069 --> 03:18:03,250
King Nestor received us kindly, but knew nothing
about Odysseus's fate.

2327
03:18:03,250 --> 03:18:09,609
He lent me a chariot, though, and with his
son Peisistratus I went by land to Sparta

2328
03:18:09,609 --> 03:18:12,109
and the palace of King Menelaus.

2329
03:18:12,109 --> 03:18:17,660
During Menelaus's journey home from the war,
he met the god Proteus.

2330
03:18:17,660 --> 03:18:25,100
Proteus told him that my father was still
alive, a prisoner on the goddess Calypso's

2331
03:18:25,100 --> 03:18:29,890
island, without a ship or a crew to take him
home.'

2332
03:18:29,890 --> 03:18:34,960
Telemachus's words warmed his mother's heart.

2333
03:18:34,960 --> 03:18:43,560
Then his guest Theoclymenus added, 'Great
Penelope, Menelaus's information is old.

2334
03:18:43,560 --> 03:18:46,220
Listen to my prophecy.

2335
03:18:46,220 --> 03:18:53,540
Your husband Odysseus is already in Ithaca,
studying his enemies, the suitors, and planning

2336
03:18:53,540 --> 03:18:55,790
their day of judgment.'

2337
03:18:55,790 --> 03:19:01,040
'I pray that you are right,' replied Penelope.

2338
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:05,729
Eumaeus and Odysseus were preparing to walk
to the city.

2339
03:19:05,729 --> 03:19:10,189
'Are you sure you want to do this?' asked
Eumaeus.

2340
03:19:10,189 --> 03:19:13,569
'The walk is not easy for a man of your age.

2341
03:19:13,569 --> 03:19:17,939
Why not stay here in the hut instead?'

2342
03:19:17,939 --> 03:19:22,410
'Thank you, Eumaeus,' replied his guest.

2343
03:19:22,410 --> 03:19:25,939
'But your young master Telemachus is right.

2344
03:19:25,939 --> 03:19:29,000
It is time for me to go.

2345
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:33,500
Could I ask you, though, for a stick to help
me walk?'

2346
03:19:33,500 --> 03:19:38,819
Eumaeus got him a stick and they started their
journey.

2347
03:19:38,819 --> 03:19:45,409
The path was steep, but Odysseus went slowly
and carefully and before long they came to

2348
03:19:45,409 --> 03:19:48,640
a stream at the edge of the city.

2349
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:54,399
There they met Melanthius, who also looked
after a farm on Odysseus's land.

2350
03:19:54,399 --> 03:19:59,600
When this man saw Eumaeus, he immediately
started shouting at him.

2351
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:05,109
'Where are you going with that old ruin of
a man?

2352
03:20:05,109 --> 03:20:09,640
I hope you are not planning to take him to
the palace.

2353
03:20:09,640 --> 03:20:16,260
I doubt that he will manage a day in the suitors'
company without broken bones.

2354
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:18,270
And the suitors are right too.

2355
03:20:18,270 --> 03:20:25,640
He is a lazy fool who deserves nothing better.'

2356
03:20:25,640 --> 03:20:31,450
Melanthius then gave Odysseus a hard kick
that almost knocked him over.

2357
03:20:31,450 --> 03:20:38,850
As Odysseus was preparing to fight back, Eumaeus
cried, 'Great Zeus, I pray that my master

2358
03:20:38,850 --> 03:20:40,779
is returned to us.

2359
03:20:40,779 --> 03:20:48,270
He would soon cure Melanthius of the arrogant
ways that he has learnt from the suitors.'

2360
03:20:48,270 --> 03:20:50,649
Melanthius laughed as he walked away.

2361
03:20:50,649 --> 03:20:57,630
'Odysseus's chance of returning is as low
as Telemachus s chance of escaping the suitors'

2362
03:20:57,630 --> 03:20:58,930
violence.

2363
03:20:58,930 --> 03:21:01,670
Things have changed, Eumaeus.

2364
03:21:01,670 --> 03:21:08,319
You have new masters now.'

2365
03:21:08,319 --> 03:21:13,220
The pig farmer and the old man continued towards
the palace.

2366
03:21:13,220 --> 03:21:18,430
There was a dog called Argus lying near the
gates.

2367
03:21:18,430 --> 03:21:24,409
When he was younger, he had been an excellent
hunting dog, trained by Odysseus himself and

2368
03:21:24,409 --> 03:21:27,319
famous for his speed.

2369
03:21:27,319 --> 03:21:34,670
But now he was old and lay all day in the
dust, alone and forgotten.

2370
03:21:34,670 --> 03:21:40,390
When this dog heard the sound of Odysseus's
voice, he lifted his head and moved his tail

2371
03:21:40,390 --> 03:21:42,390
in excitement.

2372
03:21:42,390 --> 03:21:46,729
He did not have the strength to get up and
greet his master.

2373
03:21:46,729 --> 03:21:53,880
Odysseus saw his old hunting companion and
gently touched the dog's head.

2374
03:21:53,880 --> 03:22:02,189
At that same moment, Argus died - happy at
last after waiting twenty years for his master's

2375
03:22:02,189 --> 03:22:03,909
return.

2376
03:22:03,909 --> 03:22:11,579
Eumaeus went into the palace and joined Telemachus
at the dinner in the hall.

2377
03:22:11,579 --> 03:22:17,620
Odysseus followed a few minutes later and
sat quietly in a dark corner.

2378
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:23,890
Seeing him there, Telemachus sent him a plate
of food and an empty bag.

2379
03:22:23,890 --> 03:22:29,100
Odysseus went from table to table, asking
the suitors for food for his bag.

2380
03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:34,330
'I am a poor man,' he said to each man in
the hall.

2381
03:22:34,330 --> 03:22:38,550
'Please, take pity on my hunger.'

2382
03:22:38,550 --> 03:22:44,630
When the suitors saw the thin old man, most
gave him food from their plate.

2383
03:22:44,630 --> 03:22:47,239
But Antinous had other ideas.

2384
03:22:47,239 --> 03:22:52,920
'Who let this smelly old fool into the city?

2385
03:22:52,920 --> 03:22:57,649
There are enough poor people on Ithaca already.

2386
03:22:57,649 --> 03:23:03,830
How rude he is, asking for food when he offers
nothing in return.

2387
03:23:03,830 --> 03:23:07,300
You should throw him out of the palace, Telemachus.'

2388
03:23:07,300 --> 03:23:12,100
'Thank you for your advice,' replied Telemachus.

2389
03:23:12,100 --> 03:23:18,090
'You are very anxious not to let my food go
to waste, I see!

2390
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:21,830
How can you be so greedy, Antinous?

2391
03:23:21,830 --> 03:23:24,409
You have plenty on your plate.

2392
03:23:24,409 --> 03:23:26,050
Give some of it to our guest.'

2393
03:23:26,050 --> 03:23:32,359
'I will do as I wish,' Antinous shouted back.

2394
03:23:32,359 --> 03:23:36,410
He picked up a chair and threw it at Odysseus.

2395
03:23:36,410 --> 03:23:38,989
It hit him hard on the shoulder.

2396
03:23:38,989 --> 03:23:43,619
Telemachus managed to control his anger when
he saw the attack.

2397
03:23:43,619 --> 03:23:47,040
Odysseus, too, stayed calm.

2398
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:53,430
He looked around the hall at the suitors,
saying, 'You are fortunate men, who know nothing

2399
03:23:53,430 --> 03:23:55,040
about hunger.

2400
03:23:55,040 --> 03:24:00,240
Does an empty stomach deserve this violent
treatment?

2401
03:24:00,240 --> 03:24:08,590
I hope that the gods are watching, and that
Antinous will be dead before his wedding day.'

2402
03:24:08,590 --> 03:24:13,310
Then he went back to sit on his chair in the
corner of the hall.

2403
03:24:13,310 --> 03:24:18,140
The other suitors were shocked by Antinous's
behavior.

2404
03:24:18,140 --> 03:24:25,149
Amphinomus spoke for them all when he said,
'This old man might be a god in disguise,

2405
03:24:25,149 --> 03:24:26,319
Antinous.

2406
03:24:26,319 --> 03:24:31,840
Be careful, or you will soon meet the fate
that you deserve.'

2407
03:24:31,840 --> 03:24:38,710
Amphinomus then walked over to Odysseus and
said, 'Your health, my friend!

2408
03:24:38,710 --> 03:24:42,960
Fortune has not been kind to you recently,
but I wish you a happy future.'

2409
03:24:42,960 --> 03:24:51,280
'Amphinomus,' Odysseus replied, you seem to
be a sensible man.

2410
03:24:51,280 --> 03:24:56,710
Why do you spend your days with these arrogant
suitors?

2411
03:24:56,710 --> 03:25:00,409
I have seen their violence and their greedy
ways.

2412
03:25:00,409 --> 03:25:04,869
And I know that Odysseus will soon be home.

2413
03:25:04,869 --> 03:25:09,100
Listen to my advice, Amphinomus.

2414
03:25:09,100 --> 03:25:15,359
Leave now and save yourself from Odysseus's
bloody punishment.'

2415
03:25:15,359 --> 03:25:21,579
Amphinomus walked back to the table shakily,
his mind full of doubt.

2416
03:25:21,579 --> 03:25:28,090
Then he took some more meat and joined in
the other suitors' conversation.

2417
03:25:28,090 --> 03:25:33,529
News of Antinous's attack on the stranger
soon reached Penelope in her room.

2418
03:25:33,529 --> 03:25:39,370
'I hope that the gods strike Antinous as he
struck that old man!'

2419
03:25:39,370 --> 03:25:40,979
she cried to her servants.

2420
03:25:40,979 --> 03:25:47,520
'I hate all the suitors, but Antinous is even
worse than the rest.

2421
03:25:47,520 --> 03:25:54,689
He has a cold and cruel heart.'

2422
03:25:54,689 --> 03:25:59,859
She called Eumaeus to her so that she could
ask about the stranger.

2423
03:25:59,859 --> 03:26:05,270
When she learnt that he had travelled widely
and had news of Odysseus, she wanted to question

2424
03:26:05,270 --> 03:26:07,579
him herself.

2425
03:26:07,579 --> 03:26:12,270
But she decided to wait until the suitors
had gone home to their beds.

2426
03:26:12,270 --> 03:26:16,680
First, though, she wanted to talk to her son.

2427
03:26:16,680 --> 03:26:22,560
'It is not good for him to spend so much time
in the company of those suitors,' she said

2428
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:24,260
to Eurycleia.

2429
03:26:24,260 --> 03:26:28,040
'You are right,' replied the servant.

2430
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:34,800
'But you can be grateful, at least, that Telemachus
has returned home safely and seems so grown

2431
03:26:34,800 --> 03:26:36,160
up.

2432
03:26:36,160 --> 03:26:42,470
It was always your greatest wish to see your
son with a beard on his face.'

2433
03:26:42,470 --> 03:26:47,079
Penelope thought about her servant's words
as she walked down to the hall.

2434
03:26:47,079 --> 03:26:55,119
There, turning to her son, she said, 'Telemachus,
you were always a sensible child, but now

2435
03:26:55,119 --> 03:26:58,550
your good judgment has left you.

2436
03:26:58,550 --> 03:27:04,780
Someone attacked an old man in this hall,
and you did nothing to stop him!

2437
03:27:04,780 --> 03:27:08,380
We are lucky that the stranger was not badly
hurt.'

2438
03:27:08,380 --> 03:27:13,779
'Mother,' replied Telemachus, 'you are right
to be upset.

2439
03:27:13,779 --> 03:27:17,990
But I cannot always control the behavior of
your suitors.

2440
03:27:17,990 --> 03:27:20,820
I am one against so many.'

2441
03:27:20,820 --> 03:27:24,229
Penelope now addressed the suitors.

2442
03:27:24,229 --> 03:27:30,930
'When my husband sailed to Troy, he warned
me of the dangers that he would face.

2443
03:27:30,930 --> 03:27:34,890
"I cannot promise that I will ever return,"
he said.

2444
03:27:34,890 --> 03:27:37,270
"Wait patiently for me.

2445
03:27:37,270 --> 03:27:44,659
But when you see a beard on our son's chin,
it will be time for you to choose a new husband."

2446
03:27:44,659 --> 03:27:49,119
'Well, gentlemen, that time has come.

2447
03:27:49,119 --> 03:27:53,771
I would prefer to die, but I must accept my
fate.

2448
03:27:53,771 --> 03:28:01,489
How, though, can I choose a husband, when
none of my suitors behave correctly?

2449
03:28:01,489 --> 03:28:06,190
Suitors usually bring their own animals to
eat at dinners, and they also bring their

2450
03:28:06,190 --> 03:28:08,170
lady gifts.

2451
03:28:08,170 --> 03:28:11,939
They do not enjoy free meals given by their
lady's own family.'

2452
03:28:11,939 --> 03:28:20,319
Antinous quickly replied, 'We will be happy
to bring you presents, good lady.

2453
03:28:20,319 --> 03:28:26,160
But we will not leave here - not until you
have married one of us.'

2454
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:28,460
The other suitors agreed.

2455
03:28:28,460 --> 03:28:33,449
They sent servants to fetch the finest dresses
and jewellery that they owned.

2456
03:28:33,449 --> 03:28:38,850
Penelope accepted the gifts politely and took
them to her room.

2457
03:28:38,850 --> 03:28:43,560
The suitors spent the rest of the day dancing
and singing.

2458
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:50,439
But before darkness fell, Eurymachus started
a conversation with Odysseus.

2459
03:28:50,439 --> 03:28:57,710
'Stranger,' he said, 'I could give you a job
on my lands if you wanted.

2460
03:28:57,710 --> 03:29:03,840
You could build walls and plant trees, and
receive food and clothes in payment.

2461
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:06,800
But I doubt that you want an honest job.

2462
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:10,920
You prefer to get your food for nothing, you
lazy dog!'

2463
03:29:10,920 --> 03:29:14,279
'What an insult!'

2464
03:29:14,279 --> 03:29:15,560
replied Odysseus.

2465
03:29:15,560 --> 03:29:19,899
'We should have a competition, you and I.

2466
03:29:19,899 --> 03:29:27,170
We could see who works harder - at building
walls or digging fields, or any other work

2467
03:29:27,170 --> 03:29:29,319
that you choose.

2468
03:29:29,319 --> 03:29:32,830
Or would you prefer a swordfight?

2469
03:29:32,830 --> 03:29:38,450
I could beat you in anything, you arrogant
fool.

2470
03:29:38,450 --> 03:29:47,579
You think you are a big man, a hero, but you
have never had to face a real hero.

2471
03:29:47,579 --> 03:29:54,660
If Odysseus returned now, you would soon run
away in fear.'

2472
03:29:54,660 --> 03:29:59,399
Eurymachus was very angry.

2473
03:29:59,399 --> 03:30:01,761
He took a chair and threw it at Odysseus.

2474
03:30:01,761 --> 03:30:10,000
Odysseus stepped out of the way just in time,
but it hit one of the servants.

2475
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:15,310
This man fell to the ground, dropping the
wine cup that he was holding.

2476
03:30:15,310 --> 03:30:19,970
There was a loud crash, and everyone started
shouting.

2477
03:30:19,970 --> 03:30:26,720
Telemachus called out, 'What is wrong with
you all this evening?

2478
03:30:26,720 --> 03:30:29,600
Perhaps you have had too much wine.

2479
03:30:29,600 --> 03:30:31,359
But it is late now.

2480
03:30:31,359 --> 03:30:35,189
I suggest you all go home to your beds.'

2481
03:30:35,189 --> 03:30:42,160
The suitors were surprised by Telemachus's
new confidence, but they followed his advice.

2482
03:30:42,160 --> 03:30:46,779
Soon only Telemachus and his father were left
in the hall.

2483
03:30:46,779 --> 03:30:49,390
Odysseus took advantage of their time alone.

2484
03:30:49,390 --> 03:30:51,989
'Quick, Telemachus,' he said.

2485
03:30:51,989 --> 03:30:57,229
'We must collect all the swords in the hall
and hide them in an upstairs room.

2486
03:30:57,229 --> 03:31:02,510
Leave only two swords here - one for you and
one for me.'

2487
03:31:02,510 --> 03:31:07,590
'But what will I say if the suitors notice
their absence?' asked Telemachus.

2488
03:31:07,590 --> 03:31:13,760
'Say that you are worried about their fights
when they have drunk too much wine.

2489
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:18,250
You have taken the swords away for their own
safety.'

2490
03:31:18,250 --> 03:31:23,450
When the swords were safely hidden, Telemachus
went to bed.

2491
03:31:23,450 --> 03:31:29,350
Penelope chose this quiet time of the evening
to come down from her room and meet the stranger.

2492
03:31:29,350 --> 03:31:34,920
Her servants came too, to clear the plates
from the tables.

2493
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:39,659
'Come and sit with me by the fire, stranger,'
said Penelope.

2494
03:31:39,659 --> 03:31:44,300
'Tell me who you are and where you come from.'

2495
03:31:44,300 --> 03:31:49,189
'Please do not ask me about my home and family,'
replied Odysseus.

2496
03:31:49,189 --> 03:31:52,399
'I have had a sad and difficult life.

2497
03:31:52,399 --> 03:31:56,760
But no one likes to hear about other people's
troubles.

2498
03:31:56,760 --> 03:31:58,870
Let us talk about something else.'

2499
03:31:58,870 --> 03:32:04,659
'I, too, have had a sad and difficult life,
stranger,' said Penelope.

2500
03:32:04,659 --> 03:32:10,229
'Since my husband's departure for the war
in Troy, the passing years have brought me

2501
03:32:10,229 --> 03:32:11,430
only tears.

2502
03:32:11,430 --> 03:32:17,770
And now my father wants me to marry one of
the men who behave so rudely in my home.

2503
03:32:17,770 --> 03:32:20,810
But tell me about yourself.

2504
03:32:20,810 --> 03:32:23,880
I would like to know your story.'

2505
03:32:23,880 --> 03:32:29,010
The old man repeated the story that he had
told Eumaeus in his hut.

2506
03:32:29,010 --> 03:32:35,040
When Penelope heard that he had once met Odysseus
in Crete, she decided to test his honesty.

2507
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:40,479
'Tell me, stranger, what Odysseus was like
in those days.

2508
03:32:40,479 --> 03:32:46,000
Can you remember any details of his clothes,
or any companions that were with him?'

2509
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:51,390
'It was twenty years ago, so I do not remember
much.

2510
03:32:51,390 --> 03:32:59,100
But I have not forgotten this: his clothes
were a deep purple colour, and he also wore

2511
03:32:59,100 --> 03:33:03,609
a gold pin with a picture of a dog on it.

2512
03:33:03,609 --> 03:33:05,990
Everyone admired that pin.

2513
03:33:05,990 --> 03:33:13,829
He had many companions, but he seemed closest
to a man called Eurybates.'

2514
03:33:13,829 --> 03:33:16,430
Penelope was pleased with his answer.

2515
03:33:16,430 --> 03:33:22,000
'Friend, those were the clothes and the pin
that I gave him when he left.

2516
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:26,320
But I will never again see the man who wore
them.'

2517
03:33:26,320 --> 03:33:31,119
'Dear lady, do not upset yourself.

2518
03:33:31,119 --> 03:33:37,649
I heard in Thesprotia that your husband was
planning to sail here this week.

2519
03:33:37,649 --> 03:33:45,319
For many years he was a prisoner far across
the seas on Calypso's island, but now he is

2520
03:33:45,319 --> 03:33:47,460
almost home.

2521
03:33:47,460 --> 03:33:51,550
I promise you, he will be here very soon.'

2522
03:33:51,550 --> 03:33:57,260
'I hope that you are right, but I cannot believe
it.

2523
03:33:57,260 --> 03:34:01,510
In my heart I know that he will never return.

2524
03:34:01,510 --> 03:34:03,270
But enough of this.

2525
03:34:03,270 --> 03:34:05,490
The servants must get you a blanket.

2526
03:34:05,490 --> 03:34:11,210
And Eurycleia, the oldest and best of them,
will wash your feet.'

2527
03:34:11,210 --> 03:34:13,649
She called to Eurycleia.

2528
03:34:13,649 --> 03:34:15,770
'Come and help, old friend.

2529
03:34:15,770 --> 03:34:19,279
Wash the dust from this man's aching feet.

2530
03:34:19,279 --> 03:34:24,050
He once knew Odysseus, and has travelled far
and wide.

2531
03:34:24,050 --> 03:34:30,270
If Odysseus is still alive somewhere, his
feet will be aching and dusty too.'

2532
03:34:30,270 --> 03:34:38,790
'Oh, Odysseus,' cried the servant as she fetched
a bowl of water, 'the gods are so cruel!

2533
03:34:38,790 --> 03:34:44,600
I looked after you as a baby, and still love
you like a son.

2534
03:34:44,600 --> 03:34:50,770
I want to be able to wash your feet, not the
feet of a stranger.'

2535
03:34:50,770 --> 03:34:55,989
She sat at the stranger's feet to wash them,
while Penelope gave instructions to the other

2536
03:34:55,989 --> 03:34:57,040
servants.

2537
03:34:57,040 --> 03:35:05,029
'Old man,' said Eurycleia, 'we have had many
travellers at the palace before, but none

2538
03:35:05,029 --> 03:35:06,800
of them looked like Odysseus.

2539
03:35:06,800 --> 03:35:13,840
You, though, have a very similar voice, and
similar feet too...'

2540
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:16,739
She started to wash his feet.

2541
03:35:16,739 --> 03:35:21,609
As she passed her hands over his legs, she
felt a scar.

2542
03:35:21,609 --> 03:35:27,720
She remembered that Odysseus had had a scar
in exactly the same place, from a hunting

2543
03:35:27,720 --> 03:35:30,109
accident when he was a boy.

2544
03:35:30,109 --> 03:35:37,699
She quickly looked up at the stranger above
her, and she knew - her master had returned.

2545
03:35:37,699 --> 03:35:43,130
She dropped his foot in shock, and it knocked
over the bowl with a crash.

2546
03:35:43,130 --> 03:35:50,060
But as the servant started to shout to Penelope,
Odysseus put his hand over her mouth.

2547
03:35:50,060 --> 03:35:54,859
'Say nothing, dear Eurycleia,' he whispered.

2548
03:35:54,859 --> 03:35:58,350
'No one in the palace can know.'

2549
03:35:58,350 --> 03:36:08,909
'I will be as silent as a stone, my child,'
she answered with a smile.

2550
03:36:08,909 --> 03:36:13,000
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Day of Judgement

2551
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:19,430
'The walls of this hall will be covered with
your blood, and screams of pain will fill

2552
03:36:19,430 --> 03:36:21,750
the air.'

2553
03:36:21,750 --> 03:36:25,750
Odysseus could not sleep that night.

2554
03:36:25,750 --> 03:36:31,729
He lay awake under the blanket that the servants
had brought him, thinking angrily about the

2555
03:36:31,729 --> 03:36:33,159
suitors.

2556
03:36:33,159 --> 03:36:35,330
They deserved to die.

2557
03:36:35,330 --> 03:36:39,819
But how could he and Telemachus alone kill
so many?

2558
03:36:39,819 --> 03:36:44,100
Athene came down from Mount Olympus to talk
to him.

2559
03:36:44,100 --> 03:36:48,170
'Are you sleepless again, Odysseus?

2560
03:36:48,170 --> 03:36:50,170
Stop worrying!

2561
03:36:50,170 --> 03:36:55,479
You are in your own home, under the same roof
as your wife and son.

2562
03:36:55,479 --> 03:36:58,460
And you have a goddess to help you.

2563
03:36:58,460 --> 03:37:02,670
You and I could kill ten times this number
of suitors.

2564
03:37:02,670 --> 03:37:06,939
Their fate is already decided.'

2565
03:37:06,939 --> 03:37:13,239
Then she closed Odysseus's eyes in sleep and
returned to Mount Olympus.

2566
03:37:13,239 --> 03:37:16,750
At the same moment, Penelope woke.

2567
03:37:16,750 --> 03:37:21,870
In her dream, she had seen Odysseus next to
her in bed.

2568
03:37:21,870 --> 03:37:28,079
He was young and good-looking, as he had been
on the day of his departure for Troy.

2569
03:37:28,079 --> 03:37:30,899
The thought of him brought tears to her eyes.

2570
03:37:30,899 --> 03:37:34,880
'Oh gods,' she cried, 'let me die!

2571
03:37:34,880 --> 03:37:42,520
A painful death would be better than marriage
to any man who is not Odysseus.'

2572
03:37:42,520 --> 03:37:48,610
In the morning, the palace was busy with preparations
for a meal even bigger than usual.

2573
03:37:48,610 --> 03:37:54,890
The day was a public holiday, and the suitors
planned to celebrate it well.

2574
03:37:54,890 --> 03:38:00,689
Eumaeus arrived with some pigs for the meal,
and the cow farmer Philoetius also brought

2575
03:38:00,689 --> 03:38:02,920
some animals.

2576
03:38:02,920 --> 03:38:09,029
When he saw Odysseus sitting quietly in a
corner, he stopped suddenly and stared.

2577
03:38:09,029 --> 03:38:12,240
'Greetings, stranger,' he said.

2578
03:38:12,240 --> 03:38:18,090
'You confused me just then, because you reminded
me so much of my master Odysseus.

2579
03:38:18,090 --> 03:38:23,939
Oh, it would be a wonderful surprise if he
ever came home.

2580
03:38:23,939 --> 03:38:29,399
I often think of leaving Ithaca so that I
do not have to obey the arrogant suitors'

2581
03:38:29,399 --> 03:38:30,399
orders.

2582
03:38:30,399 --> 03:38:37,140
But I cannot do it, because I cannot give
up all hope of my master's return.'

2583
03:38:37,140 --> 03:38:46,050
Odysseus replied, 'You are clearly a loyal
and honest servant, so I will give you some

2584
03:38:46,050 --> 03:38:47,050
news.

2585
03:38:47,050 --> 03:38:50,680
Odysseus is on his way home.

2586
03:38:50,680 --> 03:38:56,790
Before the end of the day, you will see him
again with your own eyes.'

2587
03:38:56,790 --> 03:39:01,580
'Stranger, I hope that you are right.

2588
03:39:01,580 --> 03:39:04,040
It is my dearest wish.'

2589
03:39:04,040 --> 03:39:10,619
The farmer Melanthius, who had also come for
the meal, heard their conversation.

2590
03:39:10,619 --> 03:39:17,420
'This smelly old man is mad, Philoetius,'
he laughed.

2591
03:39:17,420 --> 03:39:26,720
'And you are mad too, if you listen to his
crazy prophecies.'

2592
03:39:26,720 --> 03:39:31,260
When the food was ready, everyone took their
seats in the hall.

2593
03:39:31,260 --> 03:39:36,529
Telemachus carefully made sure that Odysseus
was given a seat near the doorway.

2594
03:39:36,529 --> 03:39:41,170
'Sit and eat with the suitors,' he said loudly.

2595
03:39:41,170 --> 03:39:46,260
'Suitors, there will be no fights or insults
here today.'

2596
03:39:46,260 --> 03:39:48,649
But they did not listen.

2597
03:39:48,649 --> 03:39:52,289
Soon they were shouting and laughing at Odysseus.

2598
03:39:52,289 --> 03:39:56,600
One of them threw a cow's foot at his head,
but it missed.

2599
03:39:56,600 --> 03:40:02,729
Telemachus turned to the man and said, 'You
were lucky that that did not hit him.

2600
03:40:02,729 --> 03:40:08,250
I will put my sword through any man who strikes
my guest.

2601
03:40:08,250 --> 03:40:10,500
I am not a child now.

2602
03:40:10,500 --> 03:40:16,270
I cannot stop you eating my food and drinking
my wine - there are too many of you.

2603
03:40:16,270 --> 03:40:20,370
But I will stop your bad behavior.

2604
03:40:20,370 --> 03:40:23,560
If you want to murder me for that, then do
it.

2605
03:40:23,560 --> 03:40:28,100
I would prefer to die than to let you hurt
my guest.'

2606
03:40:28,100 --> 03:40:34,220
The suitors laughed at his words, until they
saw strange drops of blood on their food.

2607
03:40:34,220 --> 03:40:36,590
Was this a sign from the gods?

2608
03:40:36,590 --> 03:40:42,210
At that moment, the voice of the prophet Theoclymenus
was heard.

2609
03:40:42,210 --> 03:40:47,410
'Unhappy men,' he cried, 'this is my prophecy.

2610
03:40:47,410 --> 03:40:54,039
The walls of this hall will be covered with
your blood, and screams of pain will fill

2611
03:40:54,039 --> 03:40:55,699
the air.

2612
03:40:55,699 --> 03:41:00,090
Your ghosts will soon be on their way to the
Underworld.'

2613
03:41:00,090 --> 03:41:02,260
Eurymachus laughed at him.

2614
03:41:02,260 --> 03:41:06,660
'He is out of his mind, poor man.

2615
03:41:06,660 --> 03:41:09,569
Can someone show him the door?'

2616
03:41:09,569 --> 03:41:15,760
'I need no help to find the door, Eurymachus,'
replied Theoclymenus.

2617
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:18,920
'I am going through it now.

2618
03:41:18,920 --> 03:41:25,840
I can see disaster coming your way, and I
want to be as far from you as possible when

2619
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:28,310
it arrives.'

2620
03:41:28,310 --> 03:41:30,109
He left the hall.

2621
03:41:30,109 --> 03:41:35,520
The suitors looked at each other nervously,
but then started to laugh again.

2622
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:43,649
'You have chosen some strange people to invite
here as your guests, Telemachus,' said one.

2623
03:41:43,649 --> 03:41:49,109
'First a smelly old man, and now a mad prophet.'

2624
03:41:49,109 --> 03:41:52,420
At this point Penelope entered the hall.

2625
03:41:52,420 --> 03:41:56,789
She had spent the morning thinking sadly about
her situation.

2626
03:41:56,789 --> 03:41:59,400
Now she had reached a decision.

2627
03:41:59,400 --> 03:42:06,640
'Suitors,' she said, you have taken advantage
of my son for long enough.

2628
03:42:06,640 --> 03:42:12,170
Although I have no wish to marry again, I
must now choose a new husband.

2629
03:42:12,170 --> 03:42:18,640
That is the only way to save my son's property
from your greedy hands.

2630
03:42:18,640 --> 03:42:24,080
Today will be the last day that you eat free
food in this palace.

2631
03:42:24,080 --> 03:42:29,810
Tomorrow I will go to the home of my chosen
husband, and the rest of you will leave this

2632
03:42:29,810 --> 03:42:30,930
place.

2633
03:42:30,930 --> 03:42:36,300
'As you can see, I am carrying a bow.

2634
03:42:36,300 --> 03:42:41,510
This belonged to my husband, the famous hero
Odysseus.

2635
03:42:41,510 --> 03:42:47,149
I will marry the man among you who is most
skilled at using this bow.

2636
03:42:47,149 --> 03:42:53,460
You must string it, which is not easy if you
do not have Odysseus's great strength.

2637
03:42:53,460 --> 03:42:58,410
And then you must shoot an arrow through twelve
axe handles.

2638
03:42:58,410 --> 03:43:02,850
Telemachus, please arrange the axes in a line.'

2639
03:43:02,850 --> 03:43:08,119
Telemachus took the axes that his mothers'
servants were carrying.

2640
03:43:08,119 --> 03:43:13,489
He dug the axe heads into the ground, so that
the metal rings on the handles were exactly

2641
03:43:13,489 --> 03:43:15,210
in line.

2642
03:43:15,210 --> 03:43:21,760
Then he said, 'Gentlemen, you have your instructions
for the competition.

2643
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:27,529
But before you start, I would like to try
the bow myself.

2644
03:43:27,529 --> 03:43:31,020
Tomorrow I will have to say goodbye to my
mother.

2645
03:43:31,020 --> 03:43:37,340
But if I succeed with the bow, at least I
will know that I am as strong as my father.'

2646
03:43:37,340 --> 03:43:42,340
Telemachus stood in the doorway with the bow.

2647
03:43:42,340 --> 03:43:48,250
Three times he tried to bend it, but three
times his strength failed.

2648
03:43:48,250 --> 03:43:52,409
The bow shook but it did not bend.

2649
03:43:52,409 --> 03:43:56,869
He tried a fourth time and felt that he would
succeed.

2650
03:43:56,869 --> 03:44:03,649
But Odysseus shook his head gently and Telemachus
put the bow back on the ground.

2651
03:44:03,649 --> 03:44:10,850
'Well, clearly I will always be known as a
weak man compared to my father,' he said.

2652
03:44:10,850 --> 03:44:13,689
'This bow is too much for me.

2653
03:44:13,689 --> 03:44:17,740
Who else will try it?'

2654
03:44:17,740 --> 03:44:22,899
Leodes was the first suitor to come forward.

2655
03:44:22,899 --> 03:44:29,140
He tried and tried to bend the bow, but it
was impossible.

2656
03:44:29,140 --> 03:44:33,290
'Friends, I cannot do it,' he said.

2657
03:44:33,290 --> 03:44:36,710
'Let someone else try.

2658
03:44:36,710 --> 03:44:41,670
But I fear that this bow will break the heart
of many men here today.'

2659
03:44:41,670 --> 03:44:49,740
Antinous cried, 'Do you think that you are
the strongest man in the room, Leodes?

2660
03:44:49,740 --> 03:44:54,040
You cannot string the bow, but others will
do it.

2661
03:44:54,040 --> 03:44:57,829
Wait and see.'

2662
03:44:57,829 --> 03:45:00,529
Other men tried, but they failed too.

2663
03:45:00,529 --> 03:45:08,779
Eurymachus and Antinous watched and waited,
learning from the others' mistakes.

2664
03:45:08,779 --> 03:45:14,579
At this point Eumaeus and Philoetius the cow
farmer left the hall.

2665
03:45:14,579 --> 03:45:19,300
The competition was bringing to an end their
hopes for Odysseus's happy return.

2666
03:45:19,300 --> 03:45:22,510
They could not watch it any longer.

2667
03:45:22,510 --> 03:45:25,949
But Odysseus came running after them.

2668
03:45:25,949 --> 03:45:30,910
'My friends,' he said, 'do not leave yet.

2669
03:45:30,910 --> 03:45:34,130
I have an important question for you.

2670
03:45:34,130 --> 03:45:40,189
If Odysseus returned, would you fight with
him, or with the suitors?'

2671
03:45:40,189 --> 03:45:47,100
'You would soon see the strength of my right
arm if I could fight the suitors at Odysseus's

2672
03:45:47,100 --> 03:45:48,100
side!'

2673
03:45:48,100 --> 03:45:49,100
Philoetius replied.

2674
03:45:49,100 --> 03:45:50,100
Eumaeus agreed enthusiastically.

2675
03:45:50,100 --> 03:45:52,880
Odysseus continued, 'Well, here I am!

2676
03:45:52,880 --> 03:46:07,460
Yes, it is true - I am your master, returned
at last.

2677
03:46:07,460 --> 03:46:12,539
Look, here is the scar that I got in a hunting
accident as a boy.'

2678
03:46:12,539 --> 03:46:16,880
As he spoke, he showed them his leg.

2679
03:46:16,880 --> 03:46:22,319
When they saw the scar, the farmers threw
their arms around their master and tears ran

2680
03:46:22,319 --> 03:46:24,069
down their faces.

2681
03:46:24,069 --> 03:46:29,930
'Stop crying,' said Odysseus, 'or someone
will see us.

2682
03:46:29,930 --> 03:46:32,859
Now, I need your help.

2683
03:46:32,859 --> 03:46:37,899
Come back inside and wait until I have the
bow in my hands.

2684
03:46:37,899 --> 03:46:43,590
Then, Philoetius, go and lock the palace gate.

2685
03:46:43,590 --> 03:46:49,050
Eumaeus, you must lock the door to the women's
rooms.

2686
03:46:49,050 --> 03:46:54,449
Tell the servants not to listen to any noises
that they hear in the hall.'

2687
03:46:54,449 --> 03:46:59,710
They went back inside and continued to watch
the suitors with the bow.

2688
03:46:59,710 --> 03:47:02,939
It was now Eurymachus's turn.

2689
03:47:02,939 --> 03:47:08,010
He was a proud man, used to success in all
things.

2690
03:47:08,010 --> 03:47:13,620
He tried again and again to string the bow,
but it refused to bend.

2691
03:47:13,620 --> 03:47:19,189
Finally, he cried out in anger, 'Stupid bow!

2692
03:47:19,189 --> 03:47:22,050
This is bad news for all of us.

2693
03:47:22,050 --> 03:47:28,079
I do not care about the marriage - there are
plenty of other rich women.

2694
03:47:28,079 --> 03:47:35,779
But all over Greece, people will say that
we are weak compared to the great Odysseus.'

2695
03:47:35,779 --> 03:47:41,460
'Everything will be fine, Eurymachus,' said
Antinous.

2696
03:47:41,460 --> 03:47:48,569
'Today is a public holiday - a day for fun,
not for tests of strength.

2697
03:47:48,569 --> 03:47:52,720
Let us leave the competition for now.

2698
03:47:52,720 --> 03:47:59,000
Tomorrow we will pray to the god Apollo, whose
skill with the bow is famous among gods and

2699
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:00,000
men.

2700
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:04,390
Then we will try our strength again.'

2701
03:48:04,390 --> 03:48:07,470
The other suitors liked this idea.

2702
03:48:07,470 --> 03:48:14,100
But Odysseus stood up and said, 'Before you
stop, could I try?

2703
03:48:14,100 --> 03:48:20,720
I would like to see if there is any strength
left in these old arms of mine.'

2704
03:48:20,720 --> 03:48:23,570
The suitors were very angry.

2705
03:48:23,570 --> 03:48:28,699
They were frightened that the strange old
man would succeed where they had failed.

2706
03:48:28,699 --> 03:48:36,870
'If you touch that bow, stranger, we will
take you prisoner and sell you abroad,' said

2707
03:48:36,870 --> 03:48:37,870
Antinous.

2708
03:48:37,870 --> 03:48:38,870
'We will...'

2709
03:48:38,870 --> 03:48:40,859
Penelope interrupted him.

2710
03:48:40,859 --> 03:48:43,199
'Antinous, stop.

2711
03:48:43,199 --> 03:48:49,720
This poor stranger is our guest, and you must
talk to him politely.

2712
03:48:49,720 --> 03:48:53,460
He has no intention of becoming my husband.

2713
03:48:53,460 --> 03:48:56,810
I am sure he knows that that is impossible.

2714
03:48:56,810 --> 03:49:00,770
So let him try his strength against the rest
of you.

2715
03:49:00,770 --> 03:49:03,910
What harm could it do?'

2716
03:49:03,910 --> 03:49:05,979
It was Eurymachus who replied.

2717
03:49:05,979 --> 03:49:11,069
'The people will think badly of us if he succeeds.

2718
03:49:11,069 --> 03:49:17,200
He is old and homeless, and we are the finest
young men in Greece.

2719
03:49:17,200 --> 03:49:20,439
Our reputations will be ruined!'

2720
03:49:20,439 --> 03:49:22,449
Penelope gave a little laugh.

2721
03:49:22,449 --> 03:49:29,989
'For years you have been eating and drinking,
uninvited, at another man's table.

2722
03:49:29,989 --> 03:49:34,570
Your reputations were ruined long ago, Eurymachus.'

2723
03:49:34,570 --> 03:49:41,649
'Mother,' said Telemachus, 'the bow was my
father's, so now it is mine.

2724
03:49:41,649 --> 03:49:44,029
I should choose who can hold it.

2725
03:49:44,029 --> 03:49:48,729
But go now to your room and busy yourself
with your work.

2726
03:49:48,729 --> 03:49:52,550
Or sleep if you can - you look tired today.

2727
03:49:52,550 --> 03:49:58,750
The competition to choose your husband will
start again tomorrow.'

2728
03:49:58,750 --> 03:50:02,020
Penelope realized that Telemachus was right.

2729
03:50:02,020 --> 03:50:05,369
She left the hall and returned to her bedroom.

2730
03:50:05,369 --> 03:50:12,350
There, tired after her sleepless night, she
fell asleep.

2731
03:50:12,350 --> 03:50:19,390
Telemachus now ordered Eumaeus to take the
bow to Odysseus.

2732
03:50:19,390 --> 03:50:26,199
The suitors shouted insults at the pig farmer,
but Eumaeus did as Telemachus said.

2733
03:50:26,199 --> 03:50:32,130
When he had given Odysseus the bow, he went
up to the women's rooms and locked the doors.

2734
03:50:32,130 --> 03:50:38,779
At the same time, Philoetius went out quietly
and locked the palace gate.

2735
03:50:38,779 --> 03:50:43,340
Now there was no escape for the suitors.

2736
03:50:43,340 --> 03:50:49,159
Odysseus was looking carefully at the bow,
to see if the passing years had damaged it.

2737
03:50:49,159 --> 03:50:54,619
When he was satisfied that it was as strong
as before, he started to bend it.

2738
03:50:54,619 --> 03:51:00,270
As easily as a bard strings his instrument
before a musical performance, Odysseus bent

2739
03:51:00,270 --> 03:51:03,010
the bow and put on the string.

2740
03:51:03,010 --> 03:51:09,270
As the suitors looked at him angrily, they
heard thunder outside.

2741
03:51:09,270 --> 03:51:13,210
Odysseus smiled at this sign of support from
the great god Zeus.

2742
03:51:13,210 --> 03:51:19,090
He picked up an arrow, aimed and shot.

2743
03:51:19,090 --> 03:51:22,729
He did not miss a single ring.

2744
03:51:22,729 --> 03:51:27,550
The arrow sped straight through from the first
axe handle to the last.

2745
03:51:27,550 --> 03:51:33,609
Odysseus looked at Telemachus to check that
he had his sword ready.

2746
03:51:33,609 --> 03:51:39,529
Then he said, 'Suitors, I have won your competition.

2747
03:51:39,529 --> 03:51:46,060
But now I am going to shoot something that
no one has ever hit before.'

2748
03:51:46,060 --> 03:51:50,270
From the doorway, he aimed an arrow at Antinous.

2749
03:51:50,270 --> 03:51:54,860
Antinous had just reached for his wine cup.

2750
03:51:54,860 --> 03:51:59,880
He never imagined for one moment that anyone
would try to kill him in the company of so

2751
03:51:59,880 --> 03:52:02,250
many friends.

2752
03:52:02,250 --> 03:52:04,910
The arrow hit him in the neck.

2753
03:52:04,910 --> 03:52:10,280
The cup dropped from his hand and he fell
to the floor with a crash.

2754
03:52:10,280 --> 03:52:15,729
The suitors stared at Antinous's dead body
in shock.

2755
03:52:15,729 --> 03:52:21,949
'Stranger,' they shouted, you will pay for
this accident with your blood.'

2756
03:52:21,949 --> 03:52:27,819
Many of them were not carrying their swords,
so they looked for the swords on the walls.

2757
03:52:27,819 --> 03:52:33,000
Too late, they realized that the swords had
disappeared.

2758
03:52:33,000 --> 03:52:38,500
They still had no idea who the stranger was,
and believed that Antinous's death had been

2759
03:52:38,500 --> 03:52:41,409
a horrible mistake.

2760
03:52:41,409 --> 03:52:45,699
Odysseus cried, 'You dogs!

2761
03:52:45,699 --> 03:52:49,930
You never thought that I would come back from
Troy.

2762
03:52:49,930 --> 03:52:53,430
So you stole my food.

2763
03:52:53,430 --> 03:52:58,109
Then you tried to steal my wife and murder
my son.

2764
03:52:58,109 --> 03:53:02,989
For those crimes, you will all die.'

2765
03:53:02,989 --> 03:53:09,859
The suitors' faces turned white with fear,
and they looked around for somewhere to hide.

2766
03:53:09,859 --> 03:53:12,710
Only Eurymachus was brave enough to speak.

2767
03:53:12,710 --> 03:53:18,899
'If you really are Odysseus, then you are
right to be angry.

2768
03:53:18,899 --> 03:53:23,029
But the person responsible for those crimes
lies dead already.

2769
03:53:23,029 --> 03:53:27,310
Antinous was power-hungry and cruel.

2770
03:53:27,310 --> 03:53:35,229
He wanted to make himself King of Ithaca after
killing your son - but he has paid the price.

2771
03:53:35,229 --> 03:53:41,779
The rest of us are guilty of nothing except
eating your food without permission.

2772
03:53:41,779 --> 03:53:49,770
For this we will each give you twenty cows
and a generous repayment in gold.

2773
03:53:49,770 --> 03:53:53,279
Think carefully, Odysseus, before you murder
innocent men.'

2774
03:53:53,279 --> 03:54:03,300
'Eurymachus,' replied Odysseus, 'no amount
of gold could pay for your crimes.

2775
03:54:03,300 --> 03:54:09,370
You have only two choices - to fight or to
run.

2776
03:54:09,370 --> 03:54:14,489
But whatever you choose, you will soon be
dead.'

2777
03:54:14,489 --> 03:54:22,789
Eurymachus called to the other suitors, 'Odysseus
will not be stopped with words.

2778
03:54:22,789 --> 03:54:25,239
Get your swords ready, men.

2779
03:54:25,239 --> 03:54:28,080
We must fight!'

2780
03:54:28,080 --> 03:54:36,330
Eurymachus ran at Odysseus with his sword,
but Odysseus shot an arrow at his chest.

2781
03:54:36,330 --> 03:54:43,020
He fell across the table, knocking food and
wine cups everywhere before lying, dead, in

2782
03:54:43,020 --> 03:54:45,229
a pool of blood.

2783
03:54:45,229 --> 03:54:48,750
Amphinomus came straight after him.

2784
03:54:48,750 --> 03:54:52,660
Telemachus killed him from behind as he ran
at Odysseus.

2785
03:54:52,660 --> 03:55:00,529
'Father,' shouted Telemachus, 'I will go and
get some swords for Eumaeus and Philoetius.'

2786
03:55:00,529 --> 03:55:03,010
'Yes,' replied Odysseus.

2787
03:55:03,010 --> 03:55:05,010
'But do it quickly.

2788
03:55:05,010 --> 03:55:08,770
When I have no more arrows, I will need help.'

2789
03:55:08,770 --> 03:55:13,069
Telemachus got swords for the two loyal servants.

2790
03:55:13,069 --> 03:55:19,659
Odysseus shot arrow after arrow, and each
one brought death to a suitor.

2791
03:55:19,659 --> 03:55:25,020
When there were no more arrows, he took his
sword and fought with his son and servants

2792
03:55:25,020 --> 03:55:26,870
at his side.

2793
03:55:26,870 --> 03:55:32,300
The suitors, with few swords between them,
could do little to defend themselves.

2794
03:55:32,300 --> 03:55:36,060
But Melanthius the farmer had an idea.

2795
03:55:36,060 --> 03:55:40,170
'Telemachus must have the swords from the
hall somewhere in the palace.

2796
03:55:40,170 --> 03:55:43,310
I know the building well.

2797
03:55:43,310 --> 03:55:44,970
I will go and look for them.'

2798
03:55:44,970 --> 03:55:51,229
He came back a few minutes later with an armful
of swords.

2799
03:55:51,229 --> 03:55:53,569
Then he went back to get more.

2800
03:55:53,569 --> 03:55:59,830
With new confidence, the suitors threw themselves
at Odysseus and his companions in the doorway.

2801
03:55:59,830 --> 03:56:05,229
Suddenly, Odysseus felt less sure that they
could win against so many.

2802
03:56:05,229 --> 03:56:10,149
'Where are they getting the swords from?'
he asked his son.

2803
03:56:10,149 --> 03:56:13,479
'Who in the palace is helping them?'

2804
03:56:13,479 --> 03:56:14,739
'Look!'

2805
03:56:14,739 --> 03:56:16,930
cried Eumaeus.

2806
03:56:16,930 --> 03:56:20,109
'Melanthius has a great pile of swords.

2807
03:56:20,109 --> 03:56:23,420
He has found the room where they are hidden.

2808
03:56:23,420 --> 03:56:28,329
He has given them to the suitors, and is going
to get more.'

2809
03:56:28,329 --> 03:56:34,069
'Telemachus and I will keep the suitors in
the hall,' Odysseus said to Eumaeus.

2810
03:56:34,069 --> 03:56:38,479
'Go now with Philoetius and stop Melanthius.'

2811
03:56:38,479 --> 03:56:43,819
Odysseus's loyal servants went in the same
direction as Melanthius.

2812
03:56:43,819 --> 03:56:48,180
They found him getting more swords from Telemachus's
secret room.

2813
03:56:48,180 --> 03:56:54,390
They jumped on him before he saw them and
he was dead when they ran back to the hall.

2814
03:56:54,390 --> 03:56:59,590
The suitors were now fighting hard, but Odysseus
and Telemachus had managed to keep them from

2815
03:56:59,590 --> 03:57:00,819
the doorway.

2816
03:57:00,819 --> 03:57:08,370
At this point, Athene came to them disguised
as Odysseus's old friend Mentor.

2817
03:57:08,370 --> 03:57:10,199
'Mentor!'

2818
03:57:10,199 --> 03:57:15,479
cried Odysseus, guessing that he was really
speaking to the goddess, you have come at

2819
03:57:15,479 --> 03:57:17,530
just the right moment.

2820
03:57:17,530 --> 03:57:19,010
Will you fight with us?'

2821
03:57:19,010 --> 03:57:24,830
'You were braver when you were fighting the
Trojans' finest soldiers,' she replied.

2822
03:57:24,830 --> 03:57:29,789
'Now you are in your own home, against a group
of lazy fools.

2823
03:57:29,789 --> 03:57:34,310
You do not need me to fight with you, Odysseus.'

2824
03:57:34,310 --> 03:57:40,520
She changed into a bird and flew high above
the men's heads to watch the fight.

2825
03:57:40,520 --> 03:57:44,680
The suitors started to attack in groups of
six.

2826
03:57:44,680 --> 03:57:50,359
But Athene made sure that their swords could
not hurt Odysseus and his companions.

2827
03:57:50,359 --> 03:57:55,840
As their attacks failed again and again, the
suitors' confidence left them.

2828
03:57:55,840 --> 03:57:59,040
Finally, they ran to hide where they could.

2829
03:57:59,040 --> 03:58:04,860
Odysseus and his men ran after them and cut
them down without pity.

2830
03:58:04,860 --> 03:58:11,479
The suitors screamed horribly as they died,
and the floor was a lake of blood.

2831
03:58:11,479 --> 03:58:15,900
Phemius the bard looked around in terror.

2832
03:58:15,900 --> 03:58:19,840
He felt sure that he was going to die with
the suitors.

2833
03:58:19,840 --> 03:58:23,840
But his only crime had been to entertain them
with his songs.

2834
03:58:23,840 --> 03:58:29,290
He ran to Odysseus and threw his arms around
the hero's knees.

2835
03:58:29,290 --> 03:58:33,319
'Sir,' he cried, 'take pity on me.

2836
03:58:33,319 --> 03:58:36,420
You will be sorry later if you kill a bard.

2837
03:58:36,420 --> 03:58:40,380
My songs bring pleasure to both gods and men.

2838
03:58:40,380 --> 03:58:45,440
Your son, Telemachus, can tell you - I did
not choose to come here.

2839
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:47,820
I was forced here by the suitors.'

2840
03:58:47,820 --> 03:58:50,770
'It is true, Father,' said Telemachus.

2841
03:58:50,770 --> 03:58:52,960
'The man is innocent.'

2842
03:58:52,960 --> 03:58:57,380
'Then go outside to safety,' Odysseus said
to Phemius.

2843
03:58:57,380 --> 03:59:02,310
'I have more work to do in here.'

2844
03:59:02,310 --> 03:59:07,319
When the bard had gone, Odysseus looked round
the hall for more suitors to kill.

2845
03:59:07,319 --> 03:59:13,439
But they were all piled on the floor on top
of each other.

2846
03:59:13,439 --> 03:59:19,860
No one was left alive.

2847
03:59:19,860 --> 03:59:24,920
CHAPTER TWELVE
Odysseus and Penelope

2848
03:59:24,920 --> 03:59:30,600
As she walked towards the hall, Penelope could
not decide how to greet him.

2849
03:59:30,600 --> 03:59:37,060
Should she be polite but cold, or should she
run into his arms and kiss him?

2850
03:59:37,060 --> 03:59:45,229
Odysseus now said to Telemachus, 'Go and fetch
Eurycleia and the other servants.

2851
03:59:45,229 --> 03:59:48,239
We must clean up the mess.'

2852
03:59:48,239 --> 03:59:52,819
The servants came out of their rooms and learnt
what had happened.

2853
03:59:52,819 --> 03:59:57,109
They threw their arms around Odysseus to welcome
him home.

2854
03:59:57,109 --> 04:00:03,290
He greeted each one by name, trying to keep
the tears from his eyes.

2855
04:00:03,290 --> 04:00:09,180
When they had taken the suitors' bodies outside
and washed away the blood in the hall, Odysseus

2856
04:00:09,180 --> 04:00:13,310
said, 'Tomorrow I will visit my father.

2857
04:00:13,310 --> 04:00:18,380
But now, Eurycleia, it is time to fetch Penelope.'

2858
04:00:18,380 --> 04:00:24,830
'Dear child,' replied the servant, you should
first change your clothes.

2859
04:00:24,830 --> 04:00:29,489
It is not right for the King of Ithaca to
be dressed in dirty bits of cloth.'

2860
04:00:29,489 --> 04:00:37,229
'No,' said Odysseus, 'I have waited twenty
years for this moment.

2861
04:00:37,229 --> 04:00:40,859
I will not wait a minute longer.'

2862
04:00:40,859 --> 04:00:44,880
So Eurycleia hurried upstairs to wake Penelope.

2863
04:00:44,880 --> 04:00:49,789
She almost fell over her own feet in her excitement
to tell the news.

2864
04:00:49,789 --> 04:00:54,580
'Penelope, my dear, wake up!' she cried.

2865
04:00:54,580 --> 04:01:00,229
'Come and see the sight that you have prayed
for all these years.

2866
04:01:00,229 --> 04:01:05,250
Odysseus is home at last, and he has killed
every one of the suitors.'

2867
04:01:05,250 --> 04:01:09,369
'Have the gods driven you mad, Eurycleia?'

2868
04:01:09,369 --> 04:01:10,640
replied Penelope.

2869
04:01:10,640 --> 04:01:14,619
'Please, do not make fun of my unhappiness.

2870
04:01:14,619 --> 04:01:18,050
Go back downstairs and let me sleep some more.'

2871
04:01:18,050 --> 04:01:24,039
'But I am not making fun of you, dear child,'
the servant continued.

2872
04:01:24,039 --> 04:01:26,880
'Odysseus really has come home.

2873
04:01:26,880 --> 04:01:31,279
He is the stranger who the suitors insulted
in the hall.'

2874
04:01:31,279 --> 04:01:35,220
Penelope's heart jumped inside her chest.

2875
04:01:35,220 --> 04:01:42,449
She rushed out of bed and held Eurycleia in
her arms, with tears running down her face.

2876
04:01:42,449 --> 04:01:45,380
'Eurycleia, can it really be true?

2877
04:01:45,380 --> 04:01:50,680
And how did he manage to kill all the suitors
without an army to help him?'

2878
04:01:50,680 --> 04:01:57,250
'I did not see anything, and I was not told
anything, but from my room I heard the cries

2879
04:01:57,250 --> 04:01:58,689
of dying men.

2880
04:01:58,689 --> 04:02:06,000
Then Telemachus called me and the other servants
into the hall, and we saw Odysseus standing

2881
04:02:06,000 --> 04:02:08,290
among the dead bodies.

2882
04:02:08,290 --> 04:02:12,989
We have cleaned up the mess, and now Odysseus
wants to see you.

2883
04:02:12,989 --> 04:02:16,369
Come now and welcome him home.'

2884
04:02:16,369 --> 04:02:20,079
'You believe too easily, dear Eurycleia.

2885
04:02:20,079 --> 04:02:22,550
There is something strange about this story.

2886
04:02:22,550 --> 04:02:26,079
I feel sure that the gods are trying to trick
us.

2887
04:02:26,079 --> 04:02:29,040
Perhaps the man in the hall is a god in disguise.'

2888
04:02:29,040 --> 04:02:37,229
'But I saw his scar - you know, the one that
he got in a hunting accident.'

2889
04:02:37,229 --> 04:02:43,890
'Eurycleia, you are a wise woman, but even
you cannot see into the hearts and minds of

2890
04:02:43,890 --> 04:02:45,859
the gods.

2891
04:02:45,859 --> 04:02:50,199
But come, I am glad that the suitors are dead.

2892
04:02:50,199 --> 04:02:53,800
I will talk to the man who killed them.'

2893
04:02:53,800 --> 04:02:59,740
As she walked towards the hall, Penelope could
not decide how to greet him.

2894
04:02:59,740 --> 04:03:06,359
Should she be polite but cold, or should she
run into his arms and kiss him?

2895
04:03:06,359 --> 04:03:11,710
When she saw the man by the fire, she just
stared at his face in confusion.

2896
04:03:11,710 --> 04:03:18,680
At times she saw her husband's face there,
but at other times he looked to her like a

2897
04:03:18,680 --> 04:03:19,680
stranger.

2898
04:03:19,680 --> 04:03:27,689
'Mother,' said Telemachus crossly, 'why are
you not welcoming my father home?'

2899
04:03:27,689 --> 04:03:31,609
'I am sorry, my son,' she replied.

2900
04:03:31,609 --> 04:03:35,330
'The shock has turned my tongue to stone.

2901
04:03:35,330 --> 04:03:39,279
I cannot say a word to him.'

2902
04:03:39,279 --> 04:03:45,840
Odysseus now said, 'Telemachus, I need to
wash, and then your mother and I need some

2903
04:03:45,840 --> 04:03:47,909
time alone.

2904
04:03:47,909 --> 04:03:51,370
Go and organize a dance for the servants.

2905
04:03:51,370 --> 04:03:53,529
And do not worry.

2906
04:03:53,529 --> 04:03:54,949
Everything will be fine.'

2907
04:03:54,949 --> 04:04:03,189
While Telemachus asked Phemius for some music,
Odysseus had a bath and put on some fine new

2908
04:04:03,189 --> 04:04:04,470
clothes.

2909
04:04:04,470 --> 04:04:13,060
Then Athene worked her magic on his appearance,
giving him a younger face and a stronger body.

2910
04:04:13,060 --> 04:04:17,979
When he went back to Penelope in the hall,
he looked like a god.

2911
04:04:17,979 --> 04:04:22,939
'Well, Penelope, you are a strange woman.

2912
04:04:22,939 --> 04:04:27,830
Few wives would stay out of their husbands'
arms for as long as this.

2913
04:04:27,830 --> 04:04:30,220
But I can wait.

2914
04:04:30,220 --> 04:04:35,199
Eurycleia, please prepare a bed for me somewhere
in the palace.

2915
04:04:35,199 --> 04:04:36,810
I will be sleeping alone tonight.'

2916
04:04:36,810 --> 04:04:42,279
'You seem a strange man to me too.

2917
04:04:42,279 --> 04:04:46,479
All these years I have carried a picture of
you in my head.

2918
04:04:46,479 --> 04:04:50,609
But you do not look like that picture.

2919
04:04:50,609 --> 04:04:57,100
Come, Eurycleia, we must move the great bed
that Odysseus himself built.

2920
04:04:57,100 --> 04:05:01,270
Take it outside the bedroom and make it comfortable
for him.'

2921
04:05:01,270 --> 04:05:06,109
This was Penelope's test for the man in front
of her.

2922
04:05:06,109 --> 04:05:13,070
He replied angrily, 'Lady, your words are
like a knife in my heart.

2923
04:05:13,070 --> 04:05:15,270
What have you done to our bed?

2924
04:05:15,270 --> 04:05:22,609
I built it myself, using a tree that was growing
in the palace as one of the bed's legs.

2925
04:05:22,609 --> 04:05:28,960
No one can move it - unless you have cut through
the wood of the tree and destroyed it.'

2926
04:05:28,960 --> 04:05:34,510
At these words, Penelope's knees began to
shake.

2927
04:05:34,510 --> 04:05:40,160
No one knew the secret of the tree-bed except
her husband and a servant who had died many

2928
04:05:40,160 --> 04:05:41,880
years before.

2929
04:05:41,880 --> 04:05:46,010
'Do not be angry with me, Odysseus,' she cried.

2930
04:05:46,010 --> 04:05:49,949
'The bed is exactly as you left it.

2931
04:05:49,949 --> 04:05:55,149
But I was so frightened that someone would
come here pretending to be you.

2932
04:05:55,149 --> 04:05:58,400
This was my test - and now I know.

2933
04:05:58,400 --> 04:06:03,460
Husband, it is really you!'

2934
04:06:03,460 --> 04:06:06,290
She threw her arms around him.

2935
04:06:06,290 --> 04:06:11,800
She was like a sailor whose ship has been
destroyed in a storm.

2936
04:06:11,800 --> 04:06:18,489
After swimming for many hours, he sees dry
land and knows that he is saved.

2937
04:06:18,489 --> 04:06:21,859
Penelope felt the same way about seeing her
husband again.

2938
04:06:21,859 --> 04:06:28,120
For a long time Odysseus and Penelope held
each other, crying silently.

2939
04:06:28,120 --> 04:06:33,880
When everyone else in the palace had gone
to bed, Odysseus finally broke the silence.

2940
04:06:33,880 --> 04:06:38,989
'Dear wife, we have not yet come to the end
of our troubles.

2941
04:06:38,989 --> 04:06:45,210
On my journey home, I spoke with the prophet
Teiresias.

2942
04:06:45,210 --> 04:06:50,020
He told me that I had to make another long
journey before I could enjoy a peaceful old

2943
04:06:50,020 --> 04:06:52,060
age.'

2944
04:06:52,060 --> 04:06:55,949
Penelope questioned her husband about the
details of this prophecy.

2945
04:06:55,949 --> 04:07:02,640
'If the gods have promised you a more peaceful
old age,' she said finally, 'then there is

2946
04:07:02,640 --> 04:07:07,340
hope that one day our troubles will end.'

2947
04:07:07,340 --> 04:07:10,069
Odysseus smiled at her words.

2948
04:07:10,069 --> 04:07:13,669
Then he took his dear wife to their bed.

2949
04:07:13,669 --> 04:07:13,960
- THE END -
