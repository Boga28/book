CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:00,880
Blood Feuds

3
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,840
No one who has not felt it can understand the pain  

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,960
of an exile. Living in a country that is not 
your own, among people who are not your people.  

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,840
Always a foreigner, an outsider, 
someone who does not belong.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,320
Two families, living in Zimbabwe, but 
the country they call home is Malawi,  

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:43,840
a country they have not seen for nearly 
thirty years, a sad, troubled country...

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
Of course my father and Uncle Phala 
had their little disagreements.  

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,320
But they were the usual ones among friends. 
Then there were all those moments of loneliness,  

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,760
of no hope at all, that everyone in 
exile feels. But they always survived,  

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,840
because they missed home so much. They 
never doubted they would return one day.

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,240
That was all my father and Uncle Phala dreamed 
about: the return to their own country.  

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,160
They talked about home all 
the time. How they grew up.  

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,000
The games they used to play. The schools 
they went to, the fight for freedom.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,440
'You young ones have no idea what we had 
to do to get rid of the British,' Uncle  

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,960
Phala used to tell us whenever he could. 
He was proud of the injury to his leg,  

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,040
which he said he got in a street battle against 
the government in the 1950s. And then my father,  

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,200
of course, felt he had to show us the marks on 
his back, which he got from beatings in prison.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,040
'I was in prison for a week,' he would 
say proudly, 'not like others who only  

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:16,080
got injured in a fight.' Over the years his time 
in prison became a month, six weeks, then a year.

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,680
'Don't listen to him,' Uncle Phala 
would answer. 'He fell out of a tree.  

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,760
That's how he got those marks!' And he 
would break into a great, deep laugh.

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,880
'Now I'll tell you how he really got his injury!'  

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,120
my father would say, also laughing. 
And they would go on like this.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,160
It wasn't just that they liked each other - it 
was much more than that. They called each other  

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,160
brother. It was twelve years or more before I 
learned that Uncle Phala was, in fact, not my  

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,840
real uncle. He and my father had met in the mining 
village in Zimbabwe where I was born and grew up.

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Their two families lived together 
in a flat as big as a matchbox, and  

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,840
my brothers and sisters and I grew up and 
went to school with Uncle Phala's children.  

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,800
When we finished school, I and most of my brothers 
became miners and lived in the mining village.

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,840
All through their years in Zimbabwe my father 
and Uncle Phala were involved in exile politics.  

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,960
It began with the mining 
village's Home Burial Society.  

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,840
This helped workers from our home country in times 
of trouble, particularly burials. Years later  

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
my father and Uncle Phala joined 
the National Redemption Movement.  

35
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,640
This was an organization of exiles who 
were against the government back home.

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,640
When I was a young boy, I sometimes went with my 
father and Uncle Phala to the beer hall where the  

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Movement held its meetings. They were both 
good organizers and fine speakers. Whenever  

38
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,160
one of them rose to speak, the hall became 
silent and people listened to every word.  

39
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,000
After they finished speaking, everybody would 
clap, and I felt so proud of them. When they  

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,840
stopped working as miners at the age of fifty, 
they began working full-time for the Movement,  

41
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,480
which grew quickly, thanks 
to a large exile community.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,440
Over the years the news from home got worse. 
We heard of arrests, violence, and worse.  

43
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
It was not the government that 
my father and Uncle Phala had  

44
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,480
fought for when the British left in the 1960s 
and our country finally became independent.

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
'In the beginning,' my father remembered,  

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,680
'we loved them. We loved the 
government. We thought it was ours.'

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
I remember Uncle Phala telling us when we 
were small about the day of independence.

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,440
'Everything seemed so beautiful that 
day. The sunshine felt a little gentler,  

49
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:39,520
the skies were bluer, the plants were greener, 
and the air smelled fresher. Just before midnight  

50
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:48,320
the British flag was taken down, and our 
flag was raised as thousands clapped. We  

51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:57,120
loved every word our leader spoke. We called 
him "the savior" - we thought he would save us.'  

52
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,080
Like so many other people, my father and 
Uncle Phala spent all the money they had  

53
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,480
to go to the capital for the independence 
ceremony - a great day for our country.

54
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,360
At that time my father worked on a farm.  

55
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Soon afterwards he lost his job when the farm 
was sold to one of the new government officers  

56
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,000
who preferred to employ workers 
from his own part of the country.  

57
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,440
Uncle Phala lost his job because he was the 
leader of a workers' organization at his factory.  

58
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,480
The new government did not allow 
workers' organizations any more,  

59
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
saying that the workers had no enemies 
now that independence had been won.

60
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,760
So Uncle Phala and my father left 
the country a couple of years later,  

61
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,840
as so many others had done before them, 
to look for jobs in the mines of Zimbabwe.

62
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,360
The exiles in Zimbabwe learned to live 
with the bad news that came from home.  

63
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,640
They would discuss it and pass it on, but it 
was something they did not actually experience.  

64
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,560
Although exile was painful, they 
could hide behind it and dream,  

65
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,160
and avoid being responsible for their own lives.

66
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,840
I did not think of myself as one of them.  

67
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Of course, I considered where my 
parents came from as my homeland too,  

68
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,640
although I had never been there. But I also 
felt strong ties to Zimbabwe, the place of my  

69
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:52,400
birth. At home we spoke my parents' language; 
elsewhere we used one of the local languages.

70
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,720
I never really had to think much about my real 
home until I was an adult. It didn't matter when  

71
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,800
I was a child. Of course, the other children would 
sometimes call us by rude names - whatever word  

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,160
was fashionable for 'foreigners' at the time - but 
it never mattered to me. Not so in later years.  

73
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,800
It was partly age, I suppose. As you grow 
older, things seem to hurt a little deeper.

74
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,800
The situation in Zimbabwe was also changing.  

75
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,640
People began to think of themselves less 
as Africans and more as Zimbabweans.  

76
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,360
We became 'foreigners', even those 
of us who were born in Zimbabwe,  

77
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,840
when it came to giving out jobs and to finding 
someone to blame for the nation's problems.

78
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,840
That is when I became more involved 
in the National Redemption Movement.  

79
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,840
Slowly, our community turned inward, 
and as far as possible we kept together,  

80
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320
helped one another, and married among ourselves.

81
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,160
I married Uncle Phala's eldest daughter, 
Mwali, which pleased both our parents greatly.  

82
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,800
'We are now real brothers!' the two men 
told everyone at the wedding ceremony.

83
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,320
I began to miss my homeland as much as my father 
and Uncle Phala did. I wanted to know more  

84
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:47,520
about it. So I asked questions; I searched for 
information in books, newspapers, and magazines.  

85
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,600
I dreamed of the shining lake with its golden 
sand beaches, the rivers, hills, and mountains,  

86
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,680
and the cool green highlands. A land, as 
my father and Uncle Phala remembered it,  

87
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,120
of tidy villages, handsome cities, 
safe streets, and smiling faces.  

88
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,520
Not this dry, empty land that 
was only good for exiles.

89
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,040
We hoped and dreamed. In 
the meantime I grew older.  

90
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:35,200
I had three children. My father and Uncle Phala 
began to look like the grandfathers they were.  

91
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,120
They continued to be involved in the Movement, 
but the situation in our homeland stayed the same.  

92
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
None of us thought it would change soon,  

93
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,880
although we did not doubt that 
change would come in the end.  

94
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,840
Nobody imagined how quickly the thirty-year-old 
regime would fall a few years later.

95
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,800
People had been unhappy for years, of course, but 
it was the church leaders who brought it into the  

96
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:17,120
open. One Easter Sunday the priests read out 
a letter in churches throughout the country.  

97
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,240
The letter did not ask for anything unusual, 
just simple things like respect for the law,  

98
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
freedom for political prisoners, 
food for the hungry...  

99
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:42,000
But the letter hit the country like a bomb. No 
one had ever demanded these things openly before.  

100
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,960
Some church leaders were arrested 
and terrible warnings were given.

101
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,560
But it was too late. The students, 
young and impatient, joined the fight.  

102
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,800
'Give us free elections!' they demanded. 
'Let political prisoners go free!'  

103
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,520
The universities and colleges were 
closed and the students were sent home.  

104
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,960
That only made things worse, because the students 
took the message back to their home towns.

105
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:29,280
Then the workers joined the battle. They 
stopped work, demanding better pay. The police  

106
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,440
tried to break up one protest march, but they 
only succeeded in shooting hundreds of workers  

107
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,520
and starting angry protests all over the 
country. Even foreign governments and banks  

108
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,440
began to talk about sending no more 
money to a regime that had lost control.

109
00:12:51,440 --> 00:13:00,320
I had never seen my father and Uncle Phala so 
excited. They had the radio and television on all  

110
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:08,720
the time, following the news from home. For some 
reason I was not as excited as I had expected.  

111
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,000
I had become so used to hoping and dreaming 
that the possibility of return frightened me.  

112
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,840
Exile had always been my life. It was all I knew.

113
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Other things made me uneasy too.  

114
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,440
Our community of exiles began to break into 
two groups: those who wanted to return,  

115
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,200
and those who were not so enthusiastic. The 
same disagreements were seen in families,  

116
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,800
and before long in the Movement itself. 
At our yearly meeting there were so many  

117
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:01,840
arguments that by the end the Movement had broken 
into three separate groups. It was sad to watch.

118
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,680
Nothing prepared me for what was waiting for us 
in our dear homeland. It was certainly beautiful,  

119
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:24,320
but that was all. We went first to my father's 
village. I was disappointed. It was nothing more  

120
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,040
than a group of rough mud houses. I met some 
of my uncles and aunts for the first time.  

121
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,080
They all looked much older than my father, 
although they were younger than he was.  

122
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,640
They were nice and friendly, but 
that was all they could offer us.  

123
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
It was the same at my mother's 
village, which was a few miles away.

124
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,720
I felt like a stranger. Our 
relations called us machona,  

125
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:06,720
meaning the long lost people. As machona, 
we were expected to bring endless presents,  

126
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,480
far more than the workers who returned every 
two years or so, carrying huge suitcases full  

127
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:23,120
of gifts for their relations - clothes, 
blankets, radios, watches, sunglasses...  

128
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,720
For a couple of months they would live like 
chiefs. Then, when all their money had gone,  

129
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,120
they would leave for Zimbabwe once 
again. But we disappointed our relations.  

130
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,440
I suspected that this was one of the reasons 
that my father had not returned for so long.

131
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,920
I also began to understand that my own people 
were no different from the people of Zimbabwe,  

132
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,160
who had many arguments and fights between 
their different ethnic groups. We were proud  

133
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,800
that our community of exiles in the mining village 
had no silly ethnic arguments of that kind,  

134
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,120
although we had people who came from different 
places and ethnic groups in the homeland.  

135
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,200
My father, for example, was from the 
south, and Uncle Phala from the north.  

136
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,840
But back in our own country I heard 
the same sad, silly arguments.

137
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,720
In fact, it was more serious than 
that. All our politicians, old and new,  

138
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,840
seemed to want to make trouble 
between the different ethnic groups.  

139
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,240
Perhaps this was because no political party had 
any real ideas or plans for our country's future.

140
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,360
My father, of course, soon got 
involved in politics. At first  

141
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,200
he was busy trying to start a business with 
the money he had brought back from Zimbabwe.  

142
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,400
Then someone asked him to be a 
leader of one of the local parties.  

143
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,880
He said no at first, but I think that was only 
because he did not want to seem too enthusiastic.

144
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:38,960
'Well, I have to do what is best for my people,' 
he said in the end. 'They need a man of my  

145
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,840
experience for leadership.' It was good for his 
business. Many of the local businesses here in  

146
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,960
the south were owned by northerners, and people 
were beginning to dislike this more and more.

147
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:05,200
A few weeks later I went north with my family 
to visit Uncle Phala. We were well received.  

148
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,760
Uncle Phala proudly introduced 
me to his relations.  

149
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,080
I liked his village better than my father's. 
The place and the people seemed less miserable.  

150
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Mwali and I decided to make our home 
there and start a business. I bought  

151
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,560
two lorries to take fish from the lake to 
the capital. It would make me a lot of money.

152
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,360
My father was not pleased with my 
plan when I returned for a visit.  

153
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,680
He said I was turning my back on my people.

154
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:53,600
'But Father,' I protested, 'we're living with 
Uncle Phala. He's your "brother", remember?'

155
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,760
'Uncle Phala is all right. 
It's his people who aren't.'

156
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,440
'I can't believe you, of all people, saying that.'

157
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,600
I did not tell Uncle Phala 
about my father's opinions.  

158
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,680
He was pleased that we had decided to stay.

159
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:26,320
'You're my favourite son. You've been good to 
my daughter.' Uncle Phala did not have a son.  

160
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,920
All of his eight children were girls.

161
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,760
Like my father, he had also started a business,  

162
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:44,160
which was doing quite well. Before long he, too, 
was asked to join a leading local political party.  

163
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,840
And like his 'brother', he waited 
for a while before he agreed.

164
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,520
And so the two most important men in my 
life became caught in the new politics.  

165
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Each party tried to organize bigger meetings, 
bigger marches than the others; no one discussed  

166
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,320
plans for government. Political prisoners, 
locked up in prison, were almost forgotten,  

167
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,120
except by their mothers. And no 
party called for national discussions  

168
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,600
on how to bring good government to 
our poor, weak, unhappy country.

169
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,400
It was difficult not to be part 
of the noisy business of politics,  

170
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,520
but I tried to stay out of it. I 
missed the quieter politics of exile.  

171
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:51,120
Here there was no hoping, no dreaming - it 
was all rough and real. Too rough, in fact.

172
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,600
A couple of months before the elections 
were held for a new government,  

173
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:07,360
violence broke out. It was not clear who 
started it. Northerners accused southerners,  

174
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,960
and southerners accused northerners. Both sides 
chased the 'foreigners', the outsiders, living  

175
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,000
among them. Church leaders and others blamed 
the government for making the troubles worse.  

176
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,840
The government, of course, said 
that they were not responsible.

177
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,880
Our "savior", now a very sick old man, 
said the violence proved he was right.  

178
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,960
It showed that party politics and elections 
were as foreign to the country as winter.

179
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:59,200
One morning we were woken by a noise like a bomb 
exploding. We looked out of the window. My lorries  

180
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:09,280
were on fire. We all knew why, but we blamed 
thieves for it. It was less painful that way.  

181
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:17,520
We were trying to keep the hopes and dreams 
of exile alive, but we could not hide from  

182
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:26,160
the real world any longer. That evening 
Uncle Phala spoke what was on our minds.

183
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,560
'You're not safe here. Maybe you should go home.'

184
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,880
'I thought I was home,' I said, 
more in sadness than in anger.

185
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,720
'So did I. This isn't the country your 
father and I left thirty years ago.  

186
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,600
They've changed it into something else, 
something terrible, that will eat us alive  

187
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,280
if we aren't careful.' For the 
first time he looked very old.

188
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,840
'We'll be out of here as soon as we can.'

189
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:18,160
'No, you'll go alone. Mwali and the children 
will be as unsafe in your home as you are here.'

190
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
'But I can't leave my family behind.'

191
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:31,440
'It's for their own good, and for your own 
good too,' he said sadly. 'Believe me.'

192
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,880
'It's not right,' I said 
softly. 'It's just not right.'

193
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,840
He did not look at Mwali or me, 
but I could see that he agreed.

194
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,240
Mwali and I spent a sleepless 
night discussing the matter.  

195
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:03,840
We decided that we would either stay together 
or leave together. Nothing would separate us.

196
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,200
But we did not have time to tell Uncle Phala what 
we had decided, because early the next morning  

197
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,840
we heard a large crowd shouting excitedly outside.

198
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,680
'We want the southerner!' they screamed. 'We 
want the southerner! Give us the southerner!'

199
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,320
'Hide under the bed quick,' Mwali whispered.

200
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,280
The shouting came closer, and some 
people started banging on the door.  

201
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:48,880
Then the noise stopped, and we heard Uncle 
Phala's voice. 'He ran away last night!'

202
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,680
'No!' the crowd shouted with 
disappointment. 'We want the southerner!'

203
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,000
'You know how these southerners are!' 
Uncle Phala shouted. 'They don't know what  

204
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,920
"brave" means. They may be good with books and 
take all the jobs for teachers and clerks, but  

205
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:22,720
that's all they can do. They can't fight. That boy 
may have balls, but he's no braver than a woman.'

206
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,520
The crowd laughed.

207
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,080
'Leave the house alone.' Suddenly 
he called out Mwali's name.  

208
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,120
'Come and tell these brave sons of the 
north where your useless husband is.'

209
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,200
I could not believe what he 
was saying. Had he gone crazy?

210
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,720
'What should I do?' she asked me desperately.

211
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:59,920
'I don't know. What's wrong with your father? 
I thought he loved me. He told me so himself.'

212
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,080
'Mwali! Please come out and tell these men 
where your good-for-nothing husband went.'

213
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:18,800
I felt suddenly angry. 'Go. He's your father.' I 
pushed her and she started crying. 'Go, I said!'

214
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:29,440
'Don't scream. They'll hear you.' She tried to get 
herself under control. 'Please stay where you are.  

215
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,040
Don't move,' she said as she 
went unwillingly to the door.

216
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:44,080
'See, she's crying,' Uncle Phala said when she 
came out. 'I told her not to marry a southerner!'  

217
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,840
The crowd began to go away, 
still shouting about southerners.  

218
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,400
Moments later Mwali returned, 
looking both shaken and thankful.

219
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I stayed indoors the whole day. 
Later Uncle Phala came to me.  

220
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:13,680
I could see the unhappiness on his face. 
'I'm sorry I had to say all those things.'

221
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,840
'So you didn't mean it,' I said coldly.

222
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,120
'Of course not.' He was trying not to cry. 
'That was the only way I could save you,  

223
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:38,800
by talking their kind of language. You'll 
always be my favourite son, no matter what.'

224
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
I do not know how long we sat there,  

225
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,800
staring at the walls. We all wished 
to be back in the old days of exile.

226
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,800
I escaped that night, and my people 
were thankful to see me safe.

227
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,720
'I always told you that 
northerners are cruel and wild,'  

228
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,680
my father said. I could not remember him 
ever saying that. But I did not feel like  

229
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:21,040
arguing with him. I just wanted to sleep 
and dream of the simpler days of exile.

230
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,840
The elections were held on time. The 
old governing party just managed to win,  

231
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,080
but the other political parties refused to accept 
the results and did not recognize the government.  

232
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,560
While this argument went on, the 
army appeared on the streets,  

233
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
and the frightened country became calm.

234
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,840
It seemed safe enough for me to ask Mwali and 
the children to come. Uncle Phala came with them.

235
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,360
When the two old men met, they 
put their arms round each other.  

236
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,240
For a while it seemed like the old days, 
except that they both looked so much older now.  

237
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,640
They were both much thinner. Uncle 
Phala walked even more painfully,  

238
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,840
and my father could not see or hear very well.

239
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:35,440
But it was not the old days. They had little 
to talk about. It was painful to watch.  

240
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,480
The friendliness and the laughter had all gone.  

241
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:53,840
The days of exile now seemed so far away and 
unreal. And yet we had been back for about a year.

242
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,440
Uncle Phala only stayed a couple of days.  

243
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,480
He left early in the morning. We all went with him 
to the bus station, except for my mother who was  

244
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:15,520
not feeling well. My father and Uncle Phala stood 
in silence with their arms round each other for  

245
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:24,400
what seemed like a long time. From the steps of 
the bus Uncle Phala waved to us with his stick.  

246
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:35,840
waved in return. Then he climbed painfully 
onto the bus and never looked back.
 
 
 
 

247
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,443
- THE END -
