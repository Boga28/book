00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,000
Dreaming of Mountains

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,080
Larry Bakewell was a cook.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,560
He studied cookery at college for five years.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,400
When he left college, he began to look for a job.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,920
He found a job as a cook in a hotel.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,480
But he did not like the job and did not stay there for very
long.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Next, Larry found a job in a busy restaurant.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,640
The restaurant was in the centre of the city.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,360
He stayed in that job for six months.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,520
Then he left.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,680
He did not like working in the city.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,000
Larry found other jobs.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,680
He worked in a school kitchen for a while, then in a
hospital kitchen.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,640
But he did not stay in any of these jobs for very long.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,520
Sometimes Larry left because he did not like the boss.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Sometimes he left because he did not like the work.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,320
It was now the month of May.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,440
And Larry had not had a job for four months.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,880
He was looking for a job, but he had not found one.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
At weekends, Larry did not look for work.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,280
Every weekend, he went to the mountains.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,440
Larry loved climbing mountains.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,280
The mountains were not very far from where he lived.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,960
In the mountains he felt free and life was exciting.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,400
No one told him what to do.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
Every day was different.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Larry wanted to live in the mountains, but there were no
jobs there.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,520
Every weekend, Larry had to go back home.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,200
Larry Bakewell was twenty-six.

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,520
He had short, dark hair and a beard.

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
He liked to wear jeans and sweaters.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,840
Larry lived in a small flat with Jack, one of his college
friends.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,920
The flat was in a large house in the suburbs of the city.

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Larry and Jack had their own rooms.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,960
The walls of Larry's room were covered with pictures of
mountains and mountaineers.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
There was climbing equipment on the floor.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,120
"Bakewell is a good name for a cook," Jack often said, and
laughed.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,240
"I've got a good name for a cook," Larry replied.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,400
"But I can't find a job that I like."

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,400
"There must be some exciting jobs somewhere," Jack said.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,880
"Working in a kitchen isn't exciting." replied Larry.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,040
It was Monday morning and Larry had to look for a job.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,600
He bought a newspaper from the small shop at the comer of
the street.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
It was raining and the streets were wet.

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,840
People were walking to work in the rain.

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,600
I must find a job soon, he thought sadly.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,120
As he walked home, Larry quickly looked through the pages of
the newspaper.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,720
There were a lot of advertisements for jobs.

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,000
But Larry did not like any of them.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,760
He stopped thinking about the jobs.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
He began to think about climbing in the mountains.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Suddenly he stopped.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
He began to read the newspaper more carefully.

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,320
There was an advertisement on the back page of the
newspaper.

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,920
It was an advertisement for a job.

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,480
A very unusual job.

58
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,641
This looks interesting!

59
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,201
Larry said to himself.

60
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,961
CHAPTER TWO

61
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:07,921
Just the Job!

62
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,761
Larry forgot about the mountains.

63
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:13,281
He stood outside the flat and did not open the door.

64
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,881
He read the newspaper advertisement again and again.

65
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:18,401
COOK WANTED

66
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,401
Are you an experienced cook?

67
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,561
Are you 25-30 years old?

68
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,081
Are you strong and healthy?

69
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,121
Have you climbed mountains?

70
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:38,921
I am taking an expedition to the mountains of northern
Afghanistan and we need someone to cook for us.

71
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:47,921
It is a scientific expedition to search for the Toruk, a
strange creature that lives in the mountains of Afghanistan.

72
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:54,521
No expedition has seen the Toruk - we will find it.

73
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,361
Apply as soon as possible to:

74
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,681
Professor Max Lugner,

75
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:02,281
Museum of Natural Science, London

76
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,121
Larry opened the door of the flat.

77
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:07,121
"Jack," he shouted.

78
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,041
"Look at this advertisement!"

79
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,081
"What is it?" Jack asked.

80
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,801
"Have you found a job?"

81
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:17,881
"Look at this," Larry said again, very excited.

82
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,681
They both read the advertisement together.

83
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:24,121
"You are an experienced cook," said Jack.

84
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:26,281
"And you have climbed mountains."

85
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:30,601
"And I'm twenty-six and strong and healthy," said Larry.

86
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,921
"This is the job for you," said Jack.

87
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:36,321
They both read the advertisement again.

88
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,601
Then Jack started to laugh.

89
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,801
"But this is silly," he said.

90
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:46,961
"No one has seen this creature - the Toruk. They are going
to look for something which no one has seen."

91
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,041
"It isn't silly," Larry replied.

92
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:55,281
"It's a job for a cook and it's a job in the mountains. It's
the job I've been looking for."

93
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,761
In the afternoon, Larry went to the library.

94
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:00,681
He did not go to the library often.

95
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,561
He did not like libraries.

96
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:07,161
Everyone in the library was sitting quietly and studying
hard.

97
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:11,561
But Larry wanted to learn more about the Toruk and about
Professor Lugner.

98
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:16,681
Larry went up to the librarian and asked, "Where can I find
books about animals?"

99
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:21,241
The librarian pointed to a long shelf on the other side of
the library.

100
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:26,241
"You will find books about animals over there," the
librarian said, and smiled.

101
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,721
Larry looked through the books carefully.

102
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,241
Some of them were old and dusty.

103
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:36,481
At last, he found a book with the title Monsters: Fact or
Fiction?

104
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:40,321
Perhaps there is something about the Toruk in this book,
Larry thought.

105
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,521
Larry opened the book and looked at the titles of the
chapters.

106
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:47,681
Each chapter was an article written by a different
scientist.

107
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,801
And each article was about a strange creature.

108
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,081
Larry looked for a chapter about the Toruk.

109
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:58,601
1. The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas by Sir Nugent
Grant 2

110
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:03,121
2. The Roc of Arabia by Mohamed ben Salah 26

111
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:14,761
3. The Loch Ness Monster by Angus McLeod 31

112
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:19,161
In chapter five, Larry found what he was looking for.

113
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,081
5. The Toruk's Claws by Max Lugner 78

114
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:26,721
Larry quickly turned to page 78 and read the first paragraph
of Professor Lugner's article.

115
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,721
I have led three expeditions to Afghanistan.

116
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,721
Each time we have seen the marks of the Toruk's claws.

117
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,321
But we have never seen the Toruk.

118
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:42,281
On the last expedition, the men who saw the claw marks
disappeared mysteriously on Mount Kanchen.

119
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,521
I believe they were killed by the Toruk.

120
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:49,241
I have seen the claw marks and I am certain that the Toruk
lives in the mountains of Afghanistan.

121
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:51,121
That's strange, Larry thought.

122
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,041
All the other men who have seen the claw marks are dead.

123
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,881
Only Professor Lugner has seen the marks and is still
living, Larry thought to himself.

124
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,481
Larry looked at all the other books on the shelf.

125
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:03,481
He found nothing more about the Toruk.

126
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:06,801
He looked round the library.

127
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,561
Everyone was sitting quietly.

128
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,481
They were reading books and studying.

129
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,001
Suddenly Larry decided.

130
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:15,961
"I'm going to apply for the job," he said aloud.

131
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,441
Everyone stopped reading and looked up at him.

132
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,881
Larry ran out of the library.

133
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,641
He went to the nearest telephone.

134
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:26,401
Professor Lugner's secretary answered the telephone.

135
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:31,121
"I'm applying for the job of the cook with Professor
Lugner's expedition," Larry said.

136
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,321
CHAPTER THREE

137
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,361
The Shadow of the Toruk

138
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,881
A few days later, Larry travelled down to London.

139
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:39,761
He was going to an interview with Professor Lugner.

140
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,681
He did not like going to London.

141
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:44,561
The city was crowded and dirty.

142
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,681
And he had to wear a suit for the interview.

143
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,881
He did not like wearing a suit.

144
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:51,001
Larry was early.

145
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:55,721
He arrived at the Museum of Natural Science at a quarter
past ten.

146
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,001
His interview with Professor Lugner was at eleven o'clock.

147
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,601
I'll look around the Museum before the interview, Larry
thought to himself.

148
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:05,641
He went into the large hall of the Museum.

149
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:10,201
In the centre of the hall there were skeletons of huge
animals and birds.

150
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,321
Larry looked at the skeletons.

151
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,881
He read the notices underneath each of them.

152
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,881
Time passed very quickly.

153
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,921
Larry looked up at the clock.

154
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,121
It was five to eleven.

155
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:22,641
My goodness!

156
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:28,841
I must hurry, Larry said to himself.

157
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,001
Professor Lugner's office was at the end of the large hall.

158
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:36,601
"Come in, Mr Bakewell," the Professor's secretary said
politely.

159
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:39,881
"Professor Lugner will be here in a minute."

160
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:42,521
Larry sat down and waited.

161
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:46,241
He saw a door with the Professor's name on it.

162
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:48,081
There were three other people waiting.

163
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,881
Are they applying for the cook's job too?

164
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,041
Larry thought.

165
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,041
He did not want to look at them.

166
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,961
He picked up a newspaper and began to read.

167
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,201
A bell rang.

168
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:09,241
The secretary said, "Mr Bakewell, Professor Lugner will see you now." Larry got up and the secretary showed him into the
Professor's room.

169
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,922
It was a large office.

170
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:15,962
On the walls, there were maps and photographs of the other
expeditions.

171
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,762
But Larry did not see them.

172
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:22,042
He was looking straight in front of him.

173
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:26,322
He was looking at a huge, strange creature - half bird, half
animal.

174
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,162
"The Toruk!" said Larry.

175
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,282
The creature was about nine feet tall.

176
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:32,562
Its head touched the ceiling of the room.

177
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:36,762
Larry looked at its large, black eyes and long beak.

178
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:40,482
It had a long beak like a bird, but it did not have wings.

179
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,642
Long, hairy arms rested at its sides.

180
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:46,482
It had huge red claws on its hands and feet.

181
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:51,282
"Those claws have killed four of my friends," said a voice.

182
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:58,482
Larry had not seen the man who was sitting at the desk
beside the creature.

183
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,522
"I am Professor Max Lugner," the man said.

184
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:05,202
The Professor was a small man, about forty years old.

185
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:07,602
He stood up and shook Larry's hand.

186
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:13,682
Professor Lugner had thin, grey hair and a small grey
moustache.

187
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:16,402
The Professor pointed to the creature beside him.

188
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,162
"This is the Toruk," he said.

189
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,202
"Beautiful, isn't he?"

190
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,562
Larry looked at the Toruk again.

191
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:25,362
He saw that it was made of painted wood.

192
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:30,522
"How do you know that the Toruk looks like this?" Larry
asked the Professor.

193
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:35,802
"Many years ago, travellers were crossing the mountains into
India," Professor Lugner replied.

194
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:47,242
"These travellers saw the Toruk. Many of the travellers died. But some of them lived and drew pictures of the Toruk.
I have the pictures here."

195
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:50,562
The Professor took the old pictures from his desk.

196
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,362
Larry looked at the pictures and at the wooden Toruk.

197
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,922
"That was many years ago," said Larry.

198
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,282
"Has anyone seen the Toruk recently?"

199
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:03,002
The Professor pointed to a photograph of four men on the
wall.

200
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:08,602
"These four men left the camp one night. They never came
back. They saw the Toruk."

201
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:12,282
"If the expedition finds the Toruk..." Larry said.

202
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:15,402
"If we find him?" said the Professor angrily.

203
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:19,042
"There is no "if". We shall find him."

204
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:23,242
The Professor did not speak for a few moments.

205
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,842
He walked around the room.

206
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:28,122
At last he stopped beside a large bookshelf.

207
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,522
On the bookshelf there were many books about the Toruk.

208
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:35,642
"I have written many books about the Toruk," the Professor
said.

209
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:47,522
"I will write one more book. When I have seen the Toruk myself, I will write my last book. I will tell everybody
what it looks like."

210
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,362
The Professor turned to Larry.

211
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:52,042
"Now I must ask you some questions," he said.

212
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:55,442
He asked Larry about his other jobs and about
mountaineering.

213
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:58,362
Larry answered the Professor's questions.

214
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,802
But he looked all the time at the wooden Toruk.

215
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:03,642
He looked at the Toruk's cruel red claws.

216
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,842
Then the Professor asked Larry his last question.

217
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:10,122
"You believe that we will find the Toruk, don't you?"

218
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:14,482
"Yes, of course," Larry replied, but he was not sure.

219
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,042
CHAPTER FOUR

220
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:17,162
Dreams Come True

221
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:20,522
After the interview, Larry could not sleep very well.

222
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:23,242
Every morning, he got up early.

223
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:26,682
As soon as the postman came he ran to the door.

224
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:29,802
But the postman did not have any letters for him.

225
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:32,362
At last a letter arrived.

226
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:35,602
The words Museum of Natural Science were on the envelope.

227
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:37,242
Larry opened it quickly.

228
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,282
He read the first few lines.

229
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,402
Museum of Natural Science

230
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:42,522
London SW7

231
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,962
5th June, 19..

232
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:45,922
Dear Mr Bakewell,

233
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:52,722
We are pleased to offer you the job of cook on our
expedition to northern Afghanistan.

234
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:54,602
Larry did not read any more.

235
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,402
"Jack!" he shouted.

236
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,562
"Jack! I've got it!"

237
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:01,202
Jack was in the kitchen eating his breakfast.

238
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:03,482
"Got what?" he asked.

239
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,882
"I've got the job," said Larry.

240
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,242
"I'm going to Afghanistan."

241
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,522
"Congratulations, Larry," Jack said.

242
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:12,762
"Now sit down and have some breakfast."

243
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,602
"I can't eat now," replied Larry.

244
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:17,162
"I'm too excited."

245
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,482
"Well, when do you leave?" Jack asked.

246
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:22,602
"I haven't read all the letter yet," Larry replied.

247
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,482
He began to read the rest of the letter aloud.

248
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:29,042
Jack listened while he was drinking his coffee.

249
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:33,322
You will attend a meeting for members of the expedition on
July 1st.

250
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:37,362
The expedition will leave London by air on September 1st.

251
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:42,522
We will reach Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the
following day.

252
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,482
When we have found guides, we will leave for the mountains.

253
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:48,922
We will begin our search for the Toruk on September 16th.

254
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,522
We will soon see the Toruk.

255
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:51,922
Yours sincerely,

256
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:54,882
MAX LUGNER (Expedition Leader)

257
00:13:54,882 --> 00:14:01,122
"Professor Lugner is sure that he will find the Toruk," Jack
said, when Larry had finished reading the letter.

258
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:10,562
"Yes," replied Larry, "I can't understand him. He has never
seen the Toruk. But he is sure that he will find it."

259
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:16,082
Jack finished his breakfast.

260
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,762
He was in a hurry.

261
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,002
He had to run to the station.

262
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:22,442
His train left in five minutes.

263
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:27,642
I have three weeks before the meeting on the first of July,
Larry said to himself.

264
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:31,842
I will find out more about Professor Lugner and the Toruk.

265
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:37,162
Larry had three questions, and wanted to find the answers to
these questions.

266
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:39,522
He wrote the questions in a notebook.

267
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:42,362
I'll have to go to the library, he thought.

268
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,882
He put on his jacket, and walked to the bus-stop.

269
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:50,482
Larry went to the library every day for the next three
weeks.

270
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,122
He looked at old newspapers.

271
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:54,242
He read books about Afghanistan.

272
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,362
In the evenings, he wrote letters.

273
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:00,082
He wrote to the people who had been with the Professor on
the other expeditions.

274
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:03,842
He found some of the answers to his questions.

275
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:07,322
But he also found other questions that had to be answered.

276
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:13,802
Perhaps I will find the answers to the other questions when
I am in Afghanistan, he thought to himself.

277
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:17,362
Here is what Larry wrote in his notebook:

278
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:18,643
QUESTIONS

279
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:24,123
1. Four men disappeared on other expeditions.

280
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,883
Did the Toruk kill them?

281
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,843
Why did no one find their bodies?

282
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,123
2. Has anyone been on more than one expedition with the
Professor?

283
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:38,443
3. The Professor says; "The Toruk has killed many
travellers." Were their bodies found?

284
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:40,763
Did the Toruk kill them?

285
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:41,683
ANSWERS

286
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:51,803
1. The Professor said; "The Toruk killed, them." Other members of the expedition said; "We did not look for the
bodies. The weather was too bad."

287
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:55,603
WHY DOES THE PROFESSOR THINK THE TORUK KILLED THE MEN?

288
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,483
2. No.

289
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:01,763
The Professor always goes with different people.

290
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:02,603
WHY?

291
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:07,043
3. Many travellers have died in the mountains.

292
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:09,723
The bodies of some of them were found.

293
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:12,483
WERE THESE TRAVELLERS KILLED BY THE TORUK?

294
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,043
CHAPTER FIVE

295
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,203
The First Meeting

296
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:18,843
On the first of July, Larry travelled to London again.

297
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:22,883
Once more, he walked through the large hall in the Museum of
Natural Science.

298
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:27,483
Once more, he looked at the huge skeletons of animals and
birds.

299
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:31,443
The members of the expedition met in a room at the back of
the Museum.

300
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:37,163
There were fifteen members: scientists, a doctor, and a
quartermaster.

301
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,243
The quartermaster looked after the equipment.

302
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:42,083
And, of course, there was the cook.

303
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,203
There were many large boxes and metal cases.

304
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:52,363
The boxes had labels on them: ROPES, FOOD, MEDICAL SUPPLIES,
PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT.

305
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:55,283
The quartermaster was bending over the boxes.

306
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:59,323
He was a young man, about the same age as Larry.

307
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:02,683
He was wearing a dark green shirt and sweater.

308
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:06,403
The quartermaster stood up and spoke to Larry.

309
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:09,403
"Are you the cook?" he said.

310
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:15,323
"I'm Greg Chaplin - the quartermaster. How do you do?" They
shook hands.

311
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:19,403
"What was your job before you joined the expedition?" Larry
asked Greg.

312
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:22,043
"I was in the army," replied Greg.

313
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:32,643
"But I got tired of life in the army. I wanted to do something different. I applied for the post of
quartermaster. And the army let me come on the expedition."

314
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:33,843
Larry was pleased.

315
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:37,083
"I wanted to do something different too," he told Greg.

316
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,363
"That's why I applied for the job of cook."

317
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,323
They spoke for a few minutes.

318
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:44,723
Then Greg said, "We must do some work now."

319
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:48,963
He pointed to the large cases marked FOOD.

320
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:52,043
"These boxes hold all our food," Greg explained.

321
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,123
Larry looked carefully at the boxes.

322
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,683
Underneath the food boxes there was another box.

323
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,403
It was a large metal box.

324
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,483
It had a label on it which said:

325
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:03,163
PROFESSOR LUGNER PRIVATE DO NOT OPEN

326
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:07,163
"What's in this box?" Larry asked Greg.

327
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:11,403
Before Greg could answer, Professor Lugner ran into the
room.

328
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:14,563
He was holding a telegram in his hand.

329
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,723
Everyone stopped talking.

330
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:31,203
"Gentlemen," the Professor said, "I have received a telegram from Kabul. Wonderful news! Some travellers have seen the
Toruk's claw marks. The marks were in the snow near the Mantra Pass. That is four days" journey north of Kabul."

331
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:32,363
They all talked excitedly.

332
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:35,283
The Professor pointed to a large map on the wall.

333
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:41,203
"We will follow this track through the Afghanistan
mountains," said the Professor, pointing to the map.

334
00:18:41,243 --> 00:19:02,163
"We will start here. This is a village called Khalid. The road ends there. In Khalid, we will find guides who will
show us the way. And we will find porters who will carry our boxes and equipment.

335
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:05,403
Everyone in the room was looking carefully at the map.

336
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:15,763
"From Khalid we will climb up to the Mantra Pass," Professor Lugner went on. "The expedition will stop at Mount Kanchen,
when we have seen the Toruk."

337
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,483
Larry looked up at the Professor.

338
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,723
Larry remembered.

339
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:24,283
The four members of the other expedition had been killed on
Mount Kanchen.

340
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:29,403
One of the scientists said, "I have a question, sir. What is
the weather like there?"

341
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,243
The Professor looked unhappy.

342
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:34,483
"The weather is bad," he said quietly.

343
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:50,043
"The weather in September is usually good for expeditions. The bad weather begins in the middle of October. But this
year, the bad weather has started early. Heavy snow has already fallen. There is more snow coming."

344
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:55,723
"If the weather is bad in Afghanistan, will we wait here in
London?" another scientist asked.

345
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:59,523
"No, we will not wait," the Professor replied.

346
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,923
"We will fly to Kabul on the first of September."

347
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:05,123
CHAPTER SIX

348
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:06,043
Ready, Steady...!

349
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:11,523
When the expedition arrived at Kabul Airport, the sun was
shining brightly.

350
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:13,483
But it was not hot.

351
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:17,043
A cold wind was blowing from the mountains in the north.

352
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:19,403
The mountains looked very near.

353
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,723
They were cold and unfriendly.

354
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:24,843
There was a lot of snow on the tops of the mountains.

355
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:28,483
And there were large white clouds in the sky above the
mountains.

356
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,083
More snow was coming.

357
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,763
From Kabul, the expedition travelled in two lorries to the
small village of Khalid.

358
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:39,043
Larry and Greg went in one lorry with the boxes and the
equipment.

359
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:42,563
The Professor and the scientists went in the second lorry.

360
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:46,043
The toad was bad and the journey was very uncomfortable.

361
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,923
The lorries arrived in the village square at Khalid.

362
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:53,163
A large crowd of people came to look at the lorries.

363
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,683
It was a crowd of men and boys.

364
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:58,363
The women stayed inside their houses.

365
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:01,163
They watched from the windows and the doorways.

366
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:04,403
Larry and Greg jumped out of the back of the first lorry.

367
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:09,123
Immediately a crowd of small boys ran up to them.

368
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:10,763
They wanted to see the equipment.

369
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,443
Some of the boys got into the back of the lorry.

370
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,083
They tried to open the boxes.

371
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,523
"Get down! Get out of the lorry!" Greg shouted.

372
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:21,643
Older men from the crowd pulled the boys out of the back of
the lorry.

373
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:25,684
The Professor jumped out of the other lorry and ran up to
Greg.

374
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:29,484
"No one must touch my box!" the Professor shouted angrily.

375
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,684
"It's here," Greg replied.

376
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,564
"No one has touched it."

377
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:35,364
Professor Lugner looked pleased.

378
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:40,324
"You and the cook go and find porters and guides," the
Professor said to Greg.

379
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:42,644
"Bring them to me this evening."

380
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,924
"Let's go," Greg said to Larry.

381
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:48,004
Larry and Greg walked along the narrow street.

382
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:51,764
On both sides of the street there were small houses with
flat roofs.

383
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:55,044
Thin dogs ran between the houses.

384
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,804
Children were playing in the street.

385
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,684
They shouted at Larry and Greg.

386
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,924
Then they ran away.

387
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:02,084
Larry and Greg reached the market-place.

388
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:03,884
Men were standing around talking.

389
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:07,004
People were selling vegetables and fruit.

390
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:09,724
Greg went up to some men.

391
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:13,444
"We want porters and guides for our expedition," Greg said.

392
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:15,084
He pointed to the mountains.

393
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,524
The men understood him.

394
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:18,244
They talked to one another.

395
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:22,804
Larry heard the word, "Toruk... Toruk".

396
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,684
One of the men turned to Larry and Greg.

397
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:28,244
He held up his hand like a claw.

398
00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:29,724
He said, "Toruk".

399
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,364
Then he shook his head.

400
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:33,564
The other men shook their heads too.

401
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,284
They all walked away.

402
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:38,004
Larry and Greg went to some more men.

403
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:40,244
The men talked about the Toruk.

404
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:43,124
They then shook their heads and walked away.

405
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:49,524
"They are frightened," Larry said to Greg at last.

406
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:53,844
"They know that the Toruk killed the men on the other
expedition," Greg replied.

407
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:56,564
Larry and Greg met some young men from another village.

408
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:58,124
These men were looking for work.

409
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:01,724
They also found a mountain guide.

410
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,364
He was an old man called Abdul.

411
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:07,164
Abdul knew the mountains well.

412
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,844
He had been a guide on another expedition with Professor
Lugner.

413
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:14,724
Abdul knew a little English.

414
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:19,644
"Will you be our guide on this expedition?" Greg asked
Abdul.

415
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,084
He thought that Abdul would say no.

416
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:26,164
Abdul's face was very brown and his eyes were bright.

417
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:28,964
"I have been waiting for you," Abdul said.

418
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:31,004
"I want to see the Toruk."

419
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:32,524
Greg looked at Larry.

420
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:34,084
They were both surprised.

421
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:36,724
Abdul was different from the other villagers.

422
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:39,804
Greg did not ask Abdul any more questions.

423
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:47,604
Greg and Larry took Abdul and the young men back to
Professor Lugner.

424
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:51,484
He was staying with the other members of the expedition in a
house in the village.

425
00:23:51,484 --> 00:23:54,044
The Professor was pleased to see the young porters.

426
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,884
But when he saw Abdul, the Professor became angry.

427
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:58,724
"Why have you brought this man?" he asked Greg.

428
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:01,404
"He says he's a guide," Greg answered.

429
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:04,564
"He has already been on one of your expeditions."

430
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:07,924
"He cannot come with us this time," the Professor shouted.

431
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:11,724
"But we must have a guide, sir," Greg replied.

432
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:14,764
"He is the only guide who will come with us."

433
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,884
The Professor looked at the old man.

434
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:18,924
He said nothing for a long time.

435
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,364
At last the Professor spoke.

436
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:24,204
"All right. He can come," he said.

437
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:27,284
"I don't understand," Greg said to Larry.

438
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:33,404
"We found a good guide. But Professor Lugner didn't want him
to come on the expedition."

439
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:36,604
"He has been on an expedition before," Larry replied.

440
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:39,964
"I know," said Greg, looking at Larry strangely.

441
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,964
"But that is a good thing, isn't it?"

442
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:45,124
Larry took his notebook out of his pocket.

443
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:47,364
He showed Greg his three questions.

444
00:24:47,404 --> 00:25:00,804
Then he read aloud, "Question two: Has anyone been on more than one expedition with the Professor? Answer: No. The
Professor always goes with different people. Why?"

445
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:02,964
"Why is that?" Greg asked.

446
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:05,404
"I don't know," Larry replied.

447
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:09,604
"But we have someone on this expedition who has searched for
the Toruk before."

448
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:10,684
CHAPTER SEVEN

449
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:11,004
...

450
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,284
Go!

451
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:15,724
There was a lot of work to do before the expedition left
Khalid.

452
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:18,724
Greg had to check the equipment carefully.

453
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:22,764
The doctor had to make sure that all the porters were
healthy.

454
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:24,084
This was not easy.

455
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:26,244
The porters were afraid of the doctor.

456
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:29,804
"We are healthy. We do not need a doctor," they said.

457
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:33,084
The scientists walked around Khalid and other villages.

458
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:38,004
They asked the villagers about the Toruk.

459
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:40,764
"Have you seen the Toruk?" they asked.

460
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:46,124
"What did the Toruk look like?" The villagers did not want
to talk about the Toruk.

461
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:47,684
They were frightened.

462
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:54,324
"If we talk about the Toruk, the Toruk will kill our
children," the villagers told the scientists.

463
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:57,764
Some of the villagers showed the scientists teeth and hair.

464
00:25:57,804 --> 00:25:59,924
"These come from the Toruk," they said.

465
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:04,044
"If we wear these around our necks, the Toruk will not kill
us."

466
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:09,284
The scientists looked carefully at the teeth and the hair.

467
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:12,084
They were the teeth and hair of horses and cows.

468
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:13,924
Abdul wanted to leave soon.

469
00:26:13,924 --> 00:26:15,364
He knew the mountains.

470
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:16,884
He understood the weather.

471
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:20,804
"The clouds are on the tops of the mountains," Abdul said to
Larry.

472
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:26,804
"That is bad. The wind is coming from the north. There will
be more snow."

473
00:26:26,804 --> 00:26:29,604
Abdul spoke to travellers who came from the mountains.

474
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:32,684
"The mountain tracks are full of snow," they said.

475
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:36,804
"I do not understand your Professor," Abdul said to Larry.

476
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:44,644
"He wants to find the Toruk. But he always looks for the
Toruk in bad weather."

477
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:47,284
Abdul told Larry a lot about the other expedition.

478
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:50,004
"The weather was very bad then," Abdul said.

479
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:52,804
"Many of the men wanted to go back to Khalid."

480
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:54,724
"Why didn't you go back?" asked Larry.

481
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:59,444
"Your Professor wanted to see the Toruk," Abdul replied
quietly.

482
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:09,124
"Four men died, but your Professor was happy. He saw the
Toruk's claw marks. Now he is well-known. He is famous."

483
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:17,244
Yes, thought Larry, Professor Lugner got his job at the
Museum of Natural Science because of that expedition.

484
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:18,964
Larry turned to Abdul.

485
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:22,964
"But why do you want to go on this expedition?" he asked.

486
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:25,004
Abdul smiled strangely.

487
00:27:25,004 --> 00:27:28,404
"I want to understand your Professor," he replied.

488
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:33,925
That evening, Professor Lugner had a meeting with the
members of the expedition.

489
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:35,925
"Everything is ready," he told them.

490
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:43,645
"We must start tomorrow. We must climb quickly to the Mantra
Pass. Travellers have seen the Toruk's claw marks there."

491
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:46,005
Everyone went to bed early that night.

492
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:48,245
They had to leave at sunrise.

493
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:51,405
But no one slept very well.

494
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,565
Larry was thinking about the Toruk.

495
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:57,125
In the morning, the clouds had gone from the mountain tops.

496
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:58,645
The sky was blue.

497
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,445
The tops of the mountains were white with snow.

498
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:06,805
Although it was early, the market-place in Khalid was full
of people.

499
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:09,885
They watched quietly.

500
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:12,885
The porters put the heavy equipment on their backs.

501
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,165
They were ready to leave.

502
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:18,445
As the expedition left the village, the people of Khalid
stood quietly.

503
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,725
They did not make any noise.

504
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:25,445
Only the dogs barked and ran along behind the expedition.

505
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:27,805
Abdul walked up to Greg and Larry.

506
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,365
"The people of Khalid are sad," he said.

507
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:34,685
"They can remember. Your Professor leads men to their
deaths."

508
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:35,685
Greg laughed.

509
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:38,605
He put his hand on Abdul's shoulder.

510
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:42,725
"It will be different this time," he said.

511
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:43,925
CHAPTER EIGHT

512
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:45,445
Towards the Mantra Pass

513
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:49,765
The expedition left Khalid quickly and started to go up the
mountain paths.

514
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:53,525
The paths were stony and it was not easy to walk on them.

515
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,085
But there was no snow.

516
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:58,965
Sometimes the expedition met travellers on the road.

517
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:04,125
They were coming from the north.

518
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,965
Their tired horses were carrying heavy goods.

519
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:09,765
They were going to sell their goods in the markets of Kabul.

520
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:13,045
Professor Lugner talked to the travellers about the Toruk.

521
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,925
"Have you seen the Toruk or the Toruk's claw marks?" the
Professor asked them.

522
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,525
The travellers talked quietly to each other before they
replied.

523
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:24,645
"We have not seen the Toruk," they said at last.

524
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:29,005
But they told the Professor about men who had been killed by
the Toruk.

525
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:36,965
Afterwards, Abdul talked to the travellers and asked them
about their journey.

526
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:40,765
"The weather has been very bad," Abdul said to Larry.

527
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:45,445
"The Mantra Pass is full of snow. It is very dangerous."

528
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:48,365
"Are you going to tell the Professor?" Larry asked.

529
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:51,005
"He won't listen," Abdul replied.

530
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:55,085
"He does not want to know about the weather. He wants to
find the Toruk."

531
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,725
The expedition climbed higher up the mountain paths.

532
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:59,405
Larry was very happy.

533
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,605
He was in the mountains.

534
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:03,605
He had a job which he liked.

535
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,805
Every day was different.

536
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:10,965
Larry sometimes thought about his jobs in England.

537
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:14,565
"I shall never like a job in England again," he said to Greg
one day.

538
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,845
Greg thought for a while.

539
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:18,445
"Why don't you write a diary?" he suggested.

540
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:25,925
"Why don't you write down what happens every day? Then you
can read about everything when you get back to England."

541
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,365
"That's a good idea!" Larry replied.

542
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:33,165
"And later you can write a book about the expedition!" Greg
continued.

543
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,605
They both laughed.

544
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:37,885
After supper, Larry went to his tent.

545
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:42,445
He got out his notebook and wrote the date at the top of the
page.

546
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,925
Then he wrote down what had happened that day.

547
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,645
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19th

548
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,365
This morning we reached the snow.

549
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:55,525
The snow is not very deep here but we have to climb more
slowly.

550
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:58,725
The track is steep and dangerous.

551
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:01,165
One of the porters fell this afternoon.

552
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:03,885
He was carrying Professor Lugner's box.

553
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:07,245
Nothing broken, but the Professor was very angry.

554
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:09,165
He did this every night.

555
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:12,285
He made a diary of what happened on the expedition.

556
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:15,565
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20th.

557
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:18,685
We have climbed higher now, and the snow is deeper.

558
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:20,405
There are clouds all around us.

559
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:23,565
Abdul is a very good guide, but he does not like Professor
Lugner.

560
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:25,565
He watches the Professor very carefully.

561
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:27,525
We talk a lot about the Toruk now.

562
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:31,525
Some of the scientists do not believe the stones about the
Toruk.

563
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:33,405
They say that there is no Toruk.

564
00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:35,405
They say that it does not exist.

565
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:36,965
I am not sure.

566
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:40,245
Perhaps there is a Toruk; perhaps there isn't.

567
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:43,325
Each night, three men guard the camp.

568
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:46,085
Each man guards the camp for three hours.

569
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,965
The guard stags in his tent but he has to keep awake.

570
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,765
He has to listen for the Toruk.

571
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:53,885
Greg is guarding the camp tonight.

572
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:56,165
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21st

573
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,245
Today heavy snow fell.

574
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:00,405
We have not left the camp.

575
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:02,565
The wind is Very strong.

576
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:04,845
It is difficult to walk.

577
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:08,605
Some op the scientists went to see the Professor today.

578
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:11,285
They want to go back to Khalid.

579
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:17,565
I do not know why they want to go back it is dangerous here,
but it is very exciting.

580
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:21,125
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22nd

581
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,565
This morning all woke up suddenly.

582
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,365
There was a loud noise outside the tents.

583
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,285
The ground was shaking.

584
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,045
The porters began to shout.

585
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:32,085
I locked out of the tent.

586
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,445
The air was full of snow.

587
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:37,645
It was palling prom the rocks above us.

588
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:42,205
No one was hurt, but some of the equipment was covered with
snow.

589
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:45,525
We have been digging the equipment out of the snow all day.

590
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:48,125
Tomorrow we will reach the Mantra Pass.

591
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:51,125
Then perhaps we win see Toruk!

592
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:56,045
On Friday evening, when Larry finished writing, he was very
tired.

593
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:58,125
Everyone was asleep.

594
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,445
Larry put out the light.

595
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,885
He listened to the wind.

596
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:03,725
He soon fell asleep.

597
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:04,885
CHAPTER NINE

598
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:06,605
Missing, Believed Killed

599
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,165
The next morning Larry woke up early.

600
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:10,165
The porters were already awake.

601
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:13,485
They were moving around and talking outside Larry's tent.

602
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,405
Greg was in the same tent as Larry.

603
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:18,005
He was still asleep.

604
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:20,925
Larry lay and listened to the noise of the wind.

605
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:24,365
What will happen today? he thought to himself.

606
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:31,165
Suddenly one of the porters began shouting: "Toruk! Toruk!"

607
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,085
Larry sat up and listened.

608
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:37,765
"What's that?" asked Greg, waking up suddenly.

609
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,806
"I don't know," Larry replied.

610
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:42,526
"I think someone has seen the Toruk."

611
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:45,086
Larry and Greg got up as fast as they could.

612
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:48,006
They put on their boots and opened the front of the tent.

613
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:51,446
There was thick cloud all round the tents.

614
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:53,766
It was difficult to see anything clearly.

615
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:57,566
The other members of the expedition were coming out of their
tents.

616
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:00,166
The porters were standing near the Professor's tent.

617
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,366
They were waving their arms and shouting.

618
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,686
Professor Lugner was with them.

619
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,806
Larry and Greg ran to the Professor.

620
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:11,566
In the snow, not far from the Professor's tent, they saw
claw marks.

621
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:13,606
"It's the Toruk!" shouted Larry.

622
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:16,806
"The Toruk has been near the camp in the night," said Greg.

623
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:21,646
"Look! The marks are clear. There is no new snow on top of
them."

624
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:25,126
The Professor was bending over one of the claw marks.

625
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:26,726
He was measuring it.

626
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:30,006
He stood up and saw Larry and Greg.

627
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:34,006
"This is the mark of the Toruk," he explained to them.

628
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:46,606
"The Toruk's foot is 36 centimetres wide and 58 centimetres
long. The claws are 8 centimetres long."

629
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:50,006
He drew a picture of the claw mark in his notebook.

630
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,726
"At last the Toruk has come to us," the Professor said.

631
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:56,446
"We will see him soon."

632
00:34:56,486 --> 00:35:00,526
"I hope I don't meet him first," Greg said to Larry.

633
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:05,046
"Why didn't the guard see the Toruk?" Larry asked suddenly.

634
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:07,686
"I don't know," replied Greg.

635
00:35:07,686 --> 00:35:09,246
"Where is the guard?"

636
00:35:09,246 --> 00:35:11,766
Soon everyone was asking the same question.

637
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:14,326
The guard was a young scientist called Guy.

638
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:17,126
He had wanted to turn back when the weather became bad.

639
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:23,406
"Perhaps he has gone back alone," someone said.

640
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:26,406
"He wasn't very happy about the expedition."

641
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:28,806
"That's impossible," said another scientist.

642
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,686
"The weather is too bad to travel alone."

643
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:34,486
The members of the expedition looked all round the camp.

644
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:36,406
They called out the young man's name.

645
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:38,406
They did not find him.

646
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:42,286
They came back to the place where the claw marks were.

647
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:45,006
Professor Lugner was still there.

648
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,166
He had not moved.

649
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:48,166
He was still making notes.

650
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:52,166
Abdul, the guide, spoke to Larry and Greg.

651
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,646
"Your friend is dead," he said.

652
00:35:54,646 --> 00:35:59,286
"The Toruk has taken him. You will never see him again."

653
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:01,526
"How do you know?" Larry asked Abdul.

654
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,006
"I have seen it happen before," Abdul replied.

655
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:07,566
"Four other men died in the same way."

656
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:11,806
"Perhaps Guy is still alive somewhere in the mountains,"
Greg said.

657
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:22,806
"We must search for him. We will follow the Toruk's claw marks. Perhaps we will find Guy, and perhaps we will see the
Toruk too."

658
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,606
"That's a good idea," everyone agreed.

659
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:27,126
But Professor Lugner was very angry.

660
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:28,486
He walked over to Greg.

661
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:32,086
"I'm the leader of this expedition," he said.

662
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:34,766
"Don't forget that."

663
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:38,566
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to the Professor politely.

664
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:41,726
"But can't we go out and search for him?"

665
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:44,806
Professor Lugner looked at everyone standing round him.

666
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:49,926
"We will not search for him," he said in a loud voice.

667
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:54,086
"The Toruk has taken Guy. We can't get him back."

668
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,166
The men looked at each other in surprise.

669
00:36:56,166 --> 00:37:00,006
"It's foolish to go out and search for him," the Professor
went on.

670
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:03,966
"The weather is too bad. More men will die."

671
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:07,166
The men began to argue with the Professor.

672
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:11,806
"If we don't look for Guy, we must go back to Khalid
immediately," one man said.

673
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:15,246
"We will not search," Professor Lugner replied angrily.

674
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:22,606
"And we will not go back. I am the leader of this
expedition. We will not go back until we have seen the
Toruk."

675
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:24,206
It was snowing heavily again.

676
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:27,166
The snow was falling on the Toruk's claw marks.

677
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:29,406
It was now difficult to see them clearly.

678
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,606
The sky was white.

679
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:32,446
More snow was coming.

680
00:37:32,526 --> 00:37:34,726
"Go back to your tents," the Professor shouted.

681
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:42,006
"Bakewell, you make the breakfast. We will stay here until
the weather gets better. I will be the guard tonight."

682
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:43,646
Everyone went back to their tents.

683
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,526
Larry went to make breakfast.

684
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,766
Greg and Abdul went with him.

685
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:52,486
"The same thing. The same thing," Abdul was saying.

686
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:55,966
"What do you mean?" Greg asked Abdul.

687
00:37:55,966 --> 00:38:00,766
"We never found the four men who were killed on the last
expedition," Abdul explained.

688
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:04,166
"We couldn't search for them because the weather was so
bad."

689
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:07,286
After breakfast, Larry looked again at his notebook.

690
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:11,486
He read what he had written there.

691
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:19,166
The Professor said: "The Toruk killed them." Other members of the expedition said "We did not look for the bodies. The
weather was too bad."

692
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:22,246
Why is Professor Lugner sure that the Toruk killed Guy?

693
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,006
Larry thought to himself.

694
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,326
CHAPTER TEN

695
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:27,166
Professor Lugner on Guard

696
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:29,126
The snow fell all morning.

697
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,486
The men stayed in their tents.

698
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:34,566
They talked about Guy and about the Toruk.

699
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:37,526
Many of the men did not agree with Professor Lugner.

700
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,286
"We must look for Guy," they said.

701
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:45,566
"Perhaps he is still alive. We don't know that the Toruk has
killed him."

702
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:48,086
"The Professor thinks only of the Toruk," others said.

703
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:50,446
"He does not care about Guy."

704
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:53,286
The porters were also talking about the Toruk.

705
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,246
Abdul was very worried.

706
00:38:55,246 --> 00:39:01,526
In the afternoon, the snow stopped and the weather was
better.

707
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:03,926
It was now possible to look for Guy.

708
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,326
Some of the scientists went to talk to Professor Lugner.

709
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:10,526
"We want to search for Guy," they said to the Professor.

710
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:12,566
Professor Lugner did not argue.

711
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,326
"All right," he replied.

712
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:19,366
"It is very dangerous. But you can go."

713
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:21,726
It was difficult to search.

714
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:24,966
They could not see the Toruk's claw marks.

715
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:27,046
They were covered by the snow.

716
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:30,246
After three hours, the men came back.

717
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,486
They had not found anything.

718
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:37,886
While the men were searching, some of the porters went to
see the Professor.

719
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:40,046
Abdul went with them.

720
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:44,326
"Many of the porters want to go back to Khalid," Abdul said
to Professor Lugner.

721
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:50,207
"The weather is too bad. We cannot go on. And the porters
are afraid of the Toruk."

722
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:52,167
The Professor listened.

723
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:53,927
At last, he spoke.

724
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:55,367
"They can go back," he said.

725
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,567
Abdul was surprised.

726
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:59,487
He looked at the porters and then he looked at the
Professor.

727
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:02,887
"But who will carry all the equipment?" he asked.

728
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:07,727
"The expedition will not leave this place," Professor Lugner
replied.

729
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:10,527
"We will look for the Toruk in the Mantra Pass."

730
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:14,167
"But how will you get back to Khalid without the porters?"
Abdul asked.

731
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:18,327
"We do not need porters," the Professor replied angrily.

732
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:23,887
"When we go back to Khalid, we will leave the equipment here
in the mountains."

733
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:24,887
He looked at Abdul.

734
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,487
"You don't want to see the Toruk," he said.

735
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:30,167
"But I cannot stop searching for the Toruk now."

736
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,487
There was a strange feeling in the camp that evening.

737
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:35,607
"I think the Toruk is watching us," Larry said to Greg.

738
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:40,687
"And I think it is laughing at us," Greg replied.

739
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:45,207
"We haven't seen the Toruk. But I feel it is here."

740
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:46,847
Everyone was tired.

741
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:49,327
Larry made a hot meal.

742
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:52,607
The men talked together for a little while.

743
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:54,247
Then they went to bed.

744
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,247
Larry could not sleep.

745
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,687
He was thinking about the questions in his notebook.

746
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:02,727
There are not enough answers, he thought to himself.

747
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,207
Larry fell asleep.

748
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,047
He dreamt about the Toruk.

749
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:10,887
In his dream he saw the huge animal in Professor Lugner's
office in London.

750
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,887
It was standing near a tent.

751
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:15,327
The tent was his tent.

752
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:18,607
The Toruk was trying to tear the tent with its sharp claws.

753
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:20,287
Suddenly Larry woke up.

754
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:22,207
He had heard a noise outside.

755
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,327
He looked at his watch.

756
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:26,087
It was half past three.

757
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:30,087
The Professor is the guard now, Larry thought to himself.

758
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,607
Larry listened.

759
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:33,847
His eyes were wide open.

760
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:36,767
Something was moving slowly near the camp.

761
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,047
Am I still dreaming?

762
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:40,087
Larry thought.

763
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:42,727
Again he heard the sound.

764
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,287
It was something large and heavy.

765
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:48,287
It was moving very slowly away from the camp.

766
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:50,007
Larry did not move.

767
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,487
He knew that he was not dreaming now.

768
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:55,327
Shall I wake Greg up? he thought.

769
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,087
He moved towards Greg.

770
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:58,887
No, he thought.

771
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:02,407
If I wake him up, we will make too much noise.

772
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:05,567
Larry picked up a large cooking knife.

773
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,847
He listened again.

774
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:10,287
The sound was moving further away.

775
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,367
He went out of the tent.

776
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:15,727
It was dark outside, but there was some light in the east.

777
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:17,327
Morning was coming.

778
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,607
The snow had stopped falling.

779
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:22,727
Perhaps the Professor has fallen asleep, Larry thought.

780
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:25,687
He went quietly to the Professor's tent.

781
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,247
There was no one in the tent.

782
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:29,287
Then he saw the footprints in the snow.

783
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:31,247
They were the Professor's footprints.

784
00:42:31,247 --> 00:42:33,407
The footprints were going away from the camp.

785
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:34,527
Larry followed them.

786
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:37,447
Perhaps the Professor heard the same sound too, Larry
thought.

787
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:39,727
Perhaps he needs help.

788
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,127
The Professor's footprints went to some high rocks.

789
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,487
Then they stopped.

790
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,767
Larry looked around.

791
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:48,407
In the early morning light, he saw a huge claw mark in the
snow.

792
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:50,207
Then he saw another.

793
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:53,687
The claw marks were going away from the rocks.

794
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:56,607
Larry held the knife tightly in his hand.

795
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,407
The Toruk has been near the tents again, he thought to
himself.

796
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,127
But where is Professor Lugner?

797
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:04,807
Larry looked up into the rocks.

798
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:08,407
Perhaps the Professor is hiding in the rocks, he thought.

799
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:11,487
He climbed up the rocks.

800
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,127
He could not see the Professor.

801
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:15,087
Suddenly he stopped.

802
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:16,527
He thought of Guy.

803
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:21,247
Perhaps the Toruk has killed Professor Lugner too, he said
to himself.

804
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:23,167
Larry quickly hid behind some rocks.

805
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:27,967
He did not want the Toruk to see him.

806
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:30,287
He looked out over the snow.

807
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:32,007
The sky was now brighter.

808
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:34,407
The morning light was shining on the snow.

809
00:43:34,407 --> 00:43:37,087
Larry saw the Toruk's claw marks clearly.

810
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,967
They went across the snow.

811
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:42,407
At the end of the track of claw marks, Larry saw a figure.

812
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:49,727
He looked from between the rocks.

813
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:56,927
The figure was Professor Lugner.

814
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:58,007
CHAPTER ELEVEN

815
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:00,647
The Professor's Secret

816
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:02,527
Larry quietly moved over the rocks.

817
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:05,207
He was now nearer to the Professor.

818
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:07,007
He hid behind a rock.

819
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:10,007
The wind was blowing up the mountain towards him.

820
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,127
Snow blew from the rocks into his face.

821
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:14,967
His eyes filled with water.

822
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:16,727
It was difficult to see.

823
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,607
Larry watched the Professor for some minutes.

824
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:22,567
Professor Lugner was bending over in the snow.

825
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:25,607
He was carrying something large and heavy.

826
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:28,967
Larry rubbed his eyes and looked again.

827
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,607
I don't believe it! he said to himself.

828
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:33,487
Larry watched the Professor in amazement.

829
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:36,927
Professor Lugner was holding a huge claw in his hands!

830
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,047
He was making the Toruk's claw marks!

831
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:45,727
As the Professor moved, he was putting the claw over his own
footprints.

832
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,647
He was hiding his footprints with the marks of the claw.

833
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:51,447
The Toruk's claw marks were left clearly in the snow.

834
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:53,807
The wind was blowing towards Larry.

835
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:55,687
He heard Professor Lugner speaking.

836
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:58,807
The Professor was talking to himself.

837
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:06,647
As he made each claw mark, he said: "The Toruk lives! They
will see! The Toruk lives!"

838
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,167
Sometimes the Professor looked towards the tents.

839
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:11,407
Larry hid behind the rocks.

840
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,247
The Professor did not see him.

841
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:16,487
Larry watched in silence for many minutes.

842
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:18,407
He felt angry.

843
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:22,047
The Professor has lied to us, he thought.

844
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:23,447
He wanted to shout.

845
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,607
He put his hands to his mouth.

846
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:29,687
Suddenly a hand came round Larry's neck and covered his
mouth.

847
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:32,087
Another hand pulled his knife away from him.

848
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:33,567
Larry fell backwards.

849
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,007
Then he saw Greg and Abdul.

850
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:38,567
They were bending over him.

851
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:40,407
"Be quiet," Greg said.

852
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,487
Larry pointed to the Professor.

853
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,687
"We know," said Greg.

854
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:46,767
"We have seen him too."

855
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:49,287
"Your Professor is mad," said Abdul.

856
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:53,247
"Everyone in the village knows that he is mad."

857
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:56,048
"But why did you follow me?" Larry asked.

858
00:45:56,048 --> 00:46:00,288
"Abdul heard you when you were leaving the camp," Greg
replied.

859
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:03,408
"He woke me up. We followed you over the rocks."

860
00:46:03,448 --> 00:46:06,008
"You were in great danger," Abdul said to Larry.

861
00:46:06,008 --> 00:46:10,688
He looked at the ground and went on quietly.

862
00:46:10,688 --> 00:46:14,928
"Your Professor has already killed five men."

863
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:16,808
Larry listened in amazement.

864
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:18,968
"Five men?" he asked.

865
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:23,928
"Did Professor Lugner kill Guy and the other four men?"

866
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:26,728
"We can't talk now," said Greg.

867
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:31,768
"The Professor will hear us. We must get back to the tents."

868
00:46:31,808 --> 00:46:34,448
The sun was rising over the mountains.

869
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:36,728
Larry could hear the Professor.

870
00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:40,688
He was still saying: "The Toruk lives! They will see!"

871
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:43,088
Suddenly Professor Lugner looked up.

872
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:46,608
Greg, Abdul and Larry hid behind the rocks.

873
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:49,328
The Professor stood up and looked around.

874
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:52,328
The huge claw was in his hands.

875
00:46:52,328 --> 00:46:54,968
"He has seen us," Larry said.

876
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:58,288
"Keep down behind the rocks," Greg said.

877
00:46:58,288 --> 00:46:59,128
They lay still.

878
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:03,448
Greg raised his head a little and looked again.

879
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,528
The Professor was bending over with the huge claw.

880
00:47:06,568 --> 00:47:10,368
"It's all right. He hasn't seen us," Greg said to the
others.

881
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:12,968
"He's finishing his work now."

882
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:15,328
The Professor made more claw marks.

883
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:17,368
He was moving towards the rocks.

884
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:22,608
"He's going to go back to the tents over the rocks," Greg
said to Larry and Abdul.

885
00:47:22,648 --> 00:47:24,488
"We must go."

886
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:27,088
They began to climb through the rocks.

887
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:28,848
Larry looked back.

888
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:31,008
He could see the Professor.

889
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:33,848
Professor Lugner had reached the rocks.

890
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:36,208
He was holding the claw in his arms.

891
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:40,288
Greg, Larry and Abdul went round the tents.

892
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,648
They got back before Professor Lugner.

893
00:47:42,648 --> 00:47:46,208
They went into their tent and waited.

894
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,368
CHAPTER TWELVE

895
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:48,808
Questions to Answer

896
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:51,048
Abdul sat with Larry and Greg in their tent.

897
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,608
None of them said anything.

898
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:54,328
They waited and listened.

899
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:56,248
Soon they heard Professor Lugner.

900
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,128
He was coming back from the other side of the tents.

901
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:03,848
"He has come back a different way," Greg said very quietly.

902
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:06,568
"That's good. He won't see our footprints."

903
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:08,728
Professor Lugner went into his tent.

904
00:48:08,768 --> 00:48:10,528
"Now we can talk," said Greg.

905
00:48:10,528 --> 00:48:12,688
"There are many things to talk about."

906
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:17,248
"First, I'll make some coffee," Larry said to the other two.

907
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:20,968
They all felt thirsty and they wanted time to think.

908
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:23,568
They drank their coffee slowly.

909
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:27,208
"Can I ask the first question?" said Larry.

910
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:31,608
"How did you know that the Professor was making the Toruk's
claw marks?"

911
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,648
"Abdul followed the Professor yesterday," Greg replied.

912
00:48:34,648 --> 00:48:38,048
"He saw the Professor making the claw marks near the tents."

913
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,808
Abdul went on with the story.

914
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:42,368
"Guy was the guard," he said.

915
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:53,048
"He saw your Professor too. They began to fight. Your
Professor killed Guy with the Toruk's claw. I saw it all."

916
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:55,968
"But why didn't you tell us this yesterday?" Larry asked
Abdul.

917
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:59,888
"I did not think that anyone would believe me," Abdul
replied.

918
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:03,488
Larry took out his notebook.

919
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:07,488
"Now I can answer some of my questions," he said.

920
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:10,248
"We know that Professor Lugner killed Guy."

921
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:14,248
"And we think that he killed the four men on the other
expedition," said Greg.

922
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:17,288
"They probably found out what he was doing."

923
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:22,968
"So that is why Professor Lugner always has different people
on his expeditions," Larry said.

924
00:49:22,968 --> 00:49:28,808
"You remember that your Professor didn't want me to come on
the expedition," said Abdul.

925
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:31,928
"He was afraid that I knew too much."

926
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:33,888
Larry looked at his third question.

927
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:40,888
"But many Afghan travellers have seen the Toruk's claw marks
too," Larry said to the others.

928
00:49:40,888 --> 00:49:42,968
"That's true," said Abdul.

929
00:49:42,968 --> 00:49:46,568
"Your Professor has not made all the claw marks."

930
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:48,368
Larry and Greg looked at each other.

931
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:50,928
"Who made the other claw marks?" Greg asked Abdul.

932
00:49:50,928 --> 00:49:53,888
Abdul smiled and raised his hands in the air.

933
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:57,248
"I don't know," he replied.

934
00:49:57,248 --> 00:50:03,248
"Perhaps the Toruk is alive. Perhaps the Toruk does exist."

935
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:05,088
Larry put down his notebook.

936
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:08,568
"So we don't have all the answers," he said.

937
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:11,048
There were sounds outside.

938
00:50:11,048 --> 00:50:14,528
Some of the scientists were starting to wake up.

939
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:16,848
"What shall we do now?" Larry asked Greg.

940
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,848
"Someone will find the claw marks soon."

941
00:50:19,848 --> 00:50:21,168
Greg thought for a while.

942
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:24,088
"We can't stop the expedition now," he said.

943
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:27,368
"I want to find the real Toruk. Perhaps it is alive."

944
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:31,488
"But Professor Lugner may kill again," Larry said.

945
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:32,928
Abdul looked up.

946
00:50:32,928 --> 00:50:37,008
"Your Professor is mad," he said to Larry.

947
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:40,648
"If you say anything, he will kill you."

948
00:50:40,648 --> 00:50:41,568
Greg turned to Larry.

949
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:44,808
"All right," he said.

950
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:48,088
We won't tell anyone what we have seen.

951
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:53,368
But we must watch Professor Lugner all the time."

952
00:50:53,368 --> 00:50:54,248
Larry agreed.

953
00:50:54,248 --> 00:50:56,408
It was time for breakfast.

954
00:50:56,448 --> 00:50:58,648
He had to make the food for everyone.

955
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:01,168
He got up and went out of the tent.

956
00:51:01,168 --> 00:51:02,168
Greg followed him.

957
00:51:02,168 --> 00:51:07,088
"Someone will find the Toruk's claw marks soon," said Larry.

958
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:12,688
"Perhaps it will be Professor Lugner," Greg replied.

959
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:16,928
"He doesn't want the scientists to see his footprints near
the Toruk's claw marks."

960
00:51:16,928 --> 00:51:20,288
"The Professor will find my footprints in the snow!" Larry
said to Greg.

961
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:22,888
"He will know that I saw him last night."

962
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:25,208
"Come on," Larry said.

963
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:30,448
"We must hurry. We must find the Toruk's claw marks before
the Professor does."

964
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:32,688
They quickly ran towards the rocks.

965
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:35,488
As they went, they ran over Larry's footprints.

966
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:39,248
"The Professor won't see your footprints now," Greg said to
Larry.

967
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:45,688
They came to the rocks and found the claw marks and
Professor Lugner's last footprint.

968
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:49,648
They stopped and shouted: "Claw marks! The Toruk!"

969
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,208
Some of the scientists ran out of their tents.

970
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:55,408
They came up to Larry and Greg and looked at the claw marks.

971
00:51:55,408 --> 00:51:56,728
Everyone was excited.

972
00:51:56,728 --> 00:51:58,408
Professor Lugner came up to them.

973
00:51:58,488 --> 00:51:59,328
He looked worried.

974
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:06,089
He knows that we have seen his footprint beside the Toruk's
claw mark, Larry thought to himself.

975
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,409
He wanted to get here first.

976
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:11,569
Greg began to talk to some of the scientists.

977
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:14,249
He wanted the Professor to hear him.

978
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:19,089
"Professor Lugner has already seen the claw marks," he said.

979
00:52:19,089 --> 00:52:23,329
"He saw them last night. Look, here are his footprints!"

980
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:25,369
Professor Lugner looked surprised.

981
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:26,649
He spoke slowly.

982
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:29,449
"Yes, I saw them last night," he said.

983
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:36,289
"I was going to tell you all after breakfast. I did not want
to frighten the porters again."

984
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,969
Greg walked up to the Professor and shook his hand.

985
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,449
"Congratulations, sir," he said.

986
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:45,449
"You must be very happy. We are sure to see the Toruk soon."

987
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:47,489
"That is my dream," he said.

988
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:56,129
"Many people say that the Toruk does not exist. But now we
know that he does." He began to speak more loudly.

989
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:59,009
"The Toruk lives!" he went on.

990
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,849
"They will see! He is alive."

991
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:02,969
Larry looked at Greg.

992
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:06,329
They remembered those words.

993
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:08,889
Greg spoke again to the Professor.

994
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:13,889
"Bakewell and I want to guard the camp tonight, sir," he
said.

995
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:16,849
"We want to see the Toruk."

996
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:18,569
Professor Lugner agreed.

997
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:24,569
"Who will be the other guard?" Professor Lugner asked the
scientists.

998
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:29,929
"It is very dangerous. The Toruk has already taken one man."

999
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:32,009
Abdul came to the front.

1000
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:35,009
"I will be the other guard," he said.

1001
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:37,169
The Professor looked at him and said nothing.

1002
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:42,809
"If Abdul is the other guard, the porters will feel
happier," one of the scientists said.

1003
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:43,929
The others agreed.

1004
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:48,969
The Professor looked down at the Toruk's claw marks, and
then at Abdul.

1005
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:50,529
Abdul smiled.

1006
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:54,649
"All right. Abdul will be the other guard," the Professor
said.

1007
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:55,689
Then he walked away.

1008
00:53:55,689 --> 00:53:57,369
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1009
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:58,609
Noises in the Night

1010
00:53:58,609 --> 00:53:59,649
Larry cooked breakfast.

1011
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:01,249
Everyone ate together.

1012
00:54:01,249 --> 00:54:05,289
But Professor Lugner was not there.

1013
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,129
He stayed in his tent.

1014
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,969
Everyone was talking about the Toruk.

1015
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:14,249
Larry, Greg and Abdul did not say anything about what they
had seen.

1016
00:54:14,249 --> 00:54:18,129
After breakfast, Professor Lugner talked to the men.

1017
00:54:18,169 --> 00:54:20,809
Together they made plans for their search.

1018
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:24,409
One of the scientists spoke about the weather.

1019
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:27,009
"The weather will be very good today," he said.

1020
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:32,289
"But it is going to get bad soon. There will be strong winds
and more heavy snow."

1021
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:37,449
"We haven't much time," Professor Lugner said to the members
of the expedition.

1022
00:54:37,489 --> 00:54:44,569
"Today, some of us will search above those rocks. The others
will come with me. We will search around Mount Kanchen."

1023
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:47,089
Larry and Greg went with Professor Lugner.

1024
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:48,929
They watched him carefully.

1025
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:51,249
They started to climb Mount Kanchen.

1026
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:55,009
It was very steep and they climbed slowly.

1027
00:54:55,049 --> 00:54:56,609
The sky was blue.

1028
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:59,769
They could see other mountains far away to the north.

1029
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:01,129
They searched all day.

1030
00:55:01,129 --> 00:55:03,049
They found nothing.

1031
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,209
They returned to the tents in the early evening.

1032
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:08,329
The others were already there.

1033
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:14,969
They had not seen the Toruk or its claw marks.

1034
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:18,049
The sun set behind the mountains.

1035
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:19,249
It became dark.

1036
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,809
Larry was the first guard.

1037
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:23,329
While the others slept, he sat in his tent.

1038
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:26,889
"If you hear the Professor, wake me up," Greg said to Larry.

1039
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:34,889
"Bad weather is coming and he will probably go out again
tonight."

1040
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:37,489
Larry wrote in his diary as usual, and listened.

1041
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:40,169
"What am I listening for? " he asked himself.

1042
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:45,089
"Am I listening for Lugner? Or am I listening for the real
Toruk? "

1043
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:49,569
Larry was very tired after the climbing and the walking.

1044
00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:52,529
It was difficult to keep awake.

1045
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:55,569
Sometimes he fell asleep for a moment, but he soon woke up.

1046
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:57,609
Later in the night, he made some coffee.

1047
00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:00,209
At eleven o'clock, Larry heard noises outside.

1048
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:02,929
Professor Lugner was coming out of his tent.

1049
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:06,049
He came towards Larry's tent and stopped.

1050
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,769
He called Larry's name quietly.

1051
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:11,969
"Bakewell, Bakewell, are you awake?" he asked.

1052
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,129
Larry suddenly felt very frightened.

1053
00:56:14,129 --> 00:56:18,009
"Does he know that I saw him making the claw marks?" he
thought.

1054
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:19,609
Does he want to kill me now?

1055
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:20,689
Larry did not speak.

1056
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:22,809
The Professor went away.

1057
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:25,449
He went back to his own tent.

1058
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:26,369
Larry listened.

1059
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:29,409
He heard the Professor opening a box.

1060
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:32,209
Then he heard the box closing again.

1061
00:56:32,249 --> 00:56:36,929
So that's where he keeps the claw, Larry thought to himself.

1062
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:39,289
It's in his metal box.

1063
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:42,169
Now I know why he watched the box so carefully.

1064
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:46,249
Larry moved quietly to the door of his tent and watched
carefully.

1065
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:48,889
He saw Professor Lugner coming out of his tent.

1066
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:51,449
The Professor walked slowly away from the camp.

1067
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:55,449
When he reached the rocks, he began to make the claw marks.

1068
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:56,649
Larry woke Greg up.

1069
00:56:56,649 --> 00:56:59,969
They went out of the tent together and climbed the rocks.

1070
00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:02,289
The Professor was going a different way this time.

1071
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:04,769
He climbed a small hill of snow towards the north.

1072
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:08,049
Larry and Greg could not see him now.

1073
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:10,649
"Shall we follow him?" Larry asked Greg.

1074
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:12,569
"No," Greg replied.

1075
00:57:12,569 --> 00:57:20,089
"We mustn't leave our footprints in the snow. We must stay
here. If anyone follows the Professor we must stop them."

1076
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:23,009
They sat and listened for sounds from the tents.

1077
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:24,689
They listened for the Professor.

1078
00:57:24,689 --> 00:57:26,529
Everything was quiet.

1079
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:29,009
Larry and Greg waited for half an hour.

1080
00:57:29,049 --> 00:57:31,609
"I'm getting cold," Larry said to Greg.

1081
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:33,129
"So am I," said Greg.

1082
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:37,049
"We'll go back to the tents soon. We can listen from our
tent."

1083
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:39,009
They climbed back towards the camp.

1084
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:44,889
Suddenly, in the north, they heard a terrible scream.

1085
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:47,489
Larry and Greg stopped and listened.

1086
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:49,169
Everything was silent.

1087
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:50,409
There were no more sounds.

1088
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:52,689
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1089
00:57:52,689 --> 00:57:53,929
A Meeting at Midnight

1090
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:57,809
The silence was frightening.

1091
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:01,769
The sound of the wind had stopped.

1092
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,649
Larry and Greg stood still.

1093
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:06,529
They did not know what to do.

1094
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,490
"What's happened?" Larry asked Greg.

1095
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,730
"I don't know," Greg replied.

1096
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,170
"I think something has happened to the Professor."

1097
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,610
"We must go back to the tents," Larry said.

1098
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,330
"We will need help."

1099
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,810
Greg did not reply.

1100
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:23,690
He was listening for another sound.

1101
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:26,530
"Perhaps we will hear something," Greg said.

1102
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,650
"Then we will know that the Professor is still alive."

1103
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,810
They stood silently and listened.

1104
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,810
Then Larry and Greg heard a sound.

1105
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,930
"The Professor's alive," Larry said.

1106
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,370
He was pleased.

1107
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:43,370
He did not like Professor Lugner, but he did not want him to
die.

1108
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,010
"Be quiet!" said Greg.

1109
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,130
"Listen!"

1110
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,770
There were more sounds.

1111
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,290
They were the sounds of something large and heavy.

1112
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:56,330
The sounds were moving away from Greg and Larry.

1113
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:02,890
"It's the Professor," said Larry.

1114
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:08,090
"He is all right. He is making the Toruk's claw marks
again."

1115
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,290
Greg was not sure.

1116
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:14,010
"But why did he scream so loudly?" he asked.

1117
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,210
"We must go and find out."

1118
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,130
The sounds were moving away.

1119
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,890
They could not hear them clearly.

1120
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,850
"The Professor is moving very quickly," Larry said.

1121
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,810
Larry and Greg climbed down from the rocks.

1122
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,690
They walked across the snow.

1123
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,410
"What about our footprints?" Larry asked.

1124
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,930
"It doesn't matter now," Greg replied.

1125
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:41,330
"If the Professor is hurt, we will have to get help. Then
everyone will know what he has been doing."

1126
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,090
Larry and Greg found the Toruk's claw marks.

1127
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,210
They both climbed up the hill.

1128
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,810
They reached the top and looked over.

1129
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,130
The other side of the hill was steep.

1130
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,850
Larry and Greg could see the track of the claw marks.

1131
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,850
The track went behind some rocks.

1132
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:00,410
"The Professor is somewhere behind those rocks," Greg said.

1133
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,250
Larry went over the top of the hill first.

1134
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,610
The snow was deep.

1135
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,170
His legs went into it.

1136
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,330
It was difficult to walk.

1137
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,770
"We must stay near the rocks," he said to Greg.

1138
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:16,690
"The snow isn't so deep there, and the rocks will hide us."

1139
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,930
They climbed up the rocks.

1140
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,370
Larry looked over a rock and saw the Professor.

1141
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,610
He was bending over in the snow.

1142
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,810
Greg stood beside Larry.

1143
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,890
They both watched the Professor.

1144
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,290
"He is looking away from us," Larry said.

1145
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:31,730
"And he isn't moving."

1146
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,610
They waited but the Professor did not move.

1147
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,490
"Shall we go nearer to him?" Larry asked Greg.

1148
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:41,410
"We'll go very slowly and very quietly," Greg replied.

1149
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,650
"We don't want him to hear us."

1150
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,970
Larry and Greg moved forward slowly.

1151
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,010
They moved nearer to the Professor.

1152
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,450
The Professor was not moving.

1153
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:53,330
Greg stopped and spoke quietly to Larry.

1154
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,930
"You go to the left," he said.

1155
01:00:55,930 --> 01:01:07,130
"I will move to the right. When I put up my hand, call Professor Lugner's name. He'll turn and look at you. Then
I'll run and jump on him."

1156
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,410
"I understand," Larry said.

1157
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,690
Larry moved through the snow to the left.

1158
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,290
Greg went to the right.

1159
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:16,410
He put up his hand.

1160
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:19,090
He was ready to run towards Professor Lugner.

1161
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,730
Larry called Professor Lugner's name.

1162
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:27,050
"Professor Lugner! Professor Lugner!" The Professor did not
move.

1163
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,570
Greg looked at Larry.

1164
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,810
Larry called again.

1165
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:33,490
This time he called more loudly.

1166
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,330
"Come on!" Greg shouted.

1167
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:39,450
They both ran towards Professor Lugner.

1168
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,210
He was dead.

1169
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:43,410
His body was bending over in the snow.

1170
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,130
"Look at the snow," Larry said to Greg.

1171
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:50,130
For the first time they saw that the snow was red with
blood.

1172
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:53,010
Larry touched Professor Lugner's body.

1173
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,090
It fell down on the snow.

1174
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,370
"Claw marks!" said Larry.

1175
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,410
The front of Professor Lugner's body was covered in blood.

1176
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,010
His clothes were tom.

1177
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,770
Huge claws had tom open his face and arms.

1178
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,650
Greg looked around.

1179
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:13,130
"Where is the Toruk's claw that the Professor was carrying?"
he asked.

1180
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,650
"It's here in the snow," Larry replied.

1181
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,250
"There's no blood on it!"

1182
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,290
"Greg, look!" Larry shouted.

1183
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:23,090
He was pointing down the hill away from the Professor's
body.

1184
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:30,130
"The Toruk's claw marks go on across the snow!" he said.

1185
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,930
A track of claw marks went down the side of the mountain.

1186
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,130
Larry looked at Greg.

1187
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:37,050
"The Toruk does exist," he said.

1188
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,210
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1189
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,370
A Job for Larry

1190
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:42,170
The members of the expedition went back to Kabul.

1191
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,290
They got on the plane for London.

1192
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:50,290
At London Airport, newspaper and television reporters were
waiting for them.

1193
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,890
The reporters asked many questions about the expedition.

1194
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,730
And they took lots of photographs.

1195
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,810
Larry was famous.

1196
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:02,330
His picture was on the front page of every newspaper in the
country.

1197
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,210
Larry was very busy.

1198
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:08,930
Everyone wanted to know about the Toruk and Professor
Lugner.

1199
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,010
Larry had to go to meetings.

1200
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,250
He had to talk to famous scientists.

1201
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:16,210
There was no time to look for jobs now.

1202
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:20,210
Two weeks after they came back, Larry and Greg were on
television.

1203
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,370
They were asked more questions about the Toruk.

1204
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:27,610
"Why did Professor Lugner make the Toruk's claw marks?" they
were asked.

1205
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,370
"The Toruk had made the Professor famous," Larry replied.

1206
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:33,130
"He wanted to show everyone that the Toruk exists."

1207
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,170
"And he did show everyone," Greg added.

1208
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,970
After the television interview, Larry was saying goodbye to
Greg.

1209
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,850
"What are you going to do now, Greg?" he asked.

1210
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,690
"I'm going back to the army," Greg replied.

1211
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,690
"And what are you going to do Larry?"

1212
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,970
"I don't know," Larry replied.

1213
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,650
"Why don't you write a book?" Greg said.

1214
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:56,170
"You can call it In Search of the Toruk."

1215
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,130
Larry laughed.

1216
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,610
That night, Larry got out his diary.

1217
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,290
He began to read it again.

1218
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,970
Then he started to write.

1219
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,490
He did not go to bed.

1220
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,810
He wrote all night.

1221
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:10,170
A year later, Larry's book was on sale in the bookshops.

1222
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,530
On the front was a picture of the Toruk.

1223
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,851
It was the wooden Toruk which stood in Professor Lugner's
room.

1224
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:17,491
Many people bought the book.

1225
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:20,731
One day, Greg was walking through the centre of London.

1226
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,491
He walked past a bookshop.

1227
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:25,051
He saw a notice in the window.

1228
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:25,891
TODAY

1229
01:04:25,931 --> 01:04:29,811
LARRY BAKEWELL, the author and climber, will visit this
shop.

1230
01:04:29,811 --> 01:04:31,691
He will sign copies of his book

1231
01:04:31,691 --> 01:04:33,131
In Search of the Toruk

1232
01:04:33,131 --> 01:04:35,051
There were lots of people inside the shop.

1233
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:37,731
They had all bought a copy of Larry's book.

1234
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:41,211
They were waiting for Larry to sign their copies.

1235
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,771
Greg bought a copy too.

1236
01:04:42,771 --> 01:04:44,291
He stood and waited.

1237
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,811
"Next person, please," Larry said.

1238
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:48,491
He did not see Greg.

1239
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:49,891
He did not look up.

1240
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:51,651
He wrote in Greg's book.

1241
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:53,251
With best wishes

1242
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:54,331
Larry Bakewell

1243
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:57,451
"What are you going to do now?" Greg asked Larry.

1244
01:04:57,451 --> 01:04:59,731
Larry knew Greg's voice immediately.

1245
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:01,411
He looked up and laughed.

1246
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:04,811
"I'm going on an expedition to look for the Toruk," said
Larry.

1247
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:07,811
"We will find the Toruk this time. I am sure."

1248
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:11,171
"I've heard that before," Greg said to Larry.

1249
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:16,331
"May I apply for the post of quartermaster?"
