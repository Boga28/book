CHAPTER ONE
Jean Valjean

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,669
One evening in October 1815, an hour before
sunset, a man with a long beard and dusty,

3
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,539
torn clothes walked into the town of Digne.

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,359
He was in his late forties, of medium height,
broad-shouldered and strong.

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,250
A leather cap half-hid his face, which was
sunburnt and shining with sweat.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,850
His rough yellow shirt was unbuttoned, revealing
a hairy chest.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:44,820
On his back was a heavy soldier's bag, and
in his hand was a large wooden stick.

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,489
The townspeople, who had never seen him before,
watched with interest as he stopped for water

9
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:51,489
at a fountain.

10
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,980
Children followed him to the marketplace,
where he stopped for more water at another

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,470
fountain.

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,890
He then crossed the square towards an inn,
and entered by the kitchen door.

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,850
The innkeeper, who was also the cook, was
busy with his pots and pans, preparing a meal

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,740
for a group of travellers who were laughing
and joking in the next room.

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,020
'What can I do for you, Monsieur?' he asked
without looking up.

16
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,900
'A meal and a bed,' said the stranger.

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,790
'Of course.'

18
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,490
The innkeeper turned to look at him.

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:37,110
Then, seeing the visitors rough appearance,
he added, 'If you can pay for it.'

20
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,770
'I have money.'

21
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,180
The stranger produced an old leather purse
from his jacket.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,049
'Then you're welcome,' the innkeeper said.

23
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,040
The stranger smiled with relief and sat down
by the fire.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,340
He did not see a young boy run out with a
note that the innkeeper had quickly written.

25
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,680
He did not see the boy return a short time
later and whisper something to the innkeeper.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
'When will the meal be ready?'

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,240
the stranger asked.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,580
'I'm sorry, Monsieur,' the innkeeper said.

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,330
'You can't stay here.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,660
I've got no free rooms.'

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,610
'Then put me in a stable.

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,300
All I need is a quiet corner somewhere.

33
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,430
After dinner

34
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,030
'You can't eat here either,' the innkeeper
interrupted.

35
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,390
'I haven't enough food.'

36
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,140
'What about all that food in the pots?'

37
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,620
The innkeeper approached and, bending towards
the man, said in a fierce whisper, 'Get out.

38
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,800
I know who you are.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Your name is Jean Valjean.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,860
You've just been released from prison.

41
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,230
I can't serve people like you here.'

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,940
The man rose without another word, picked
up his bag and stick, and left.

43
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,900
Outside, it was growing dark and a cold wind
was blowing from the mountains in the east.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,700
The man looked around, desperate for somewhere
to spend the night.

45
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,970
He tried another inn, but the same thing happened.

46
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,950
He knocked on the doors of people's houses,
but news of his arrival had quickly spread

47
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,041
and nobody would offer him shelter from the
cold.

48
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:36,480
He even tried sleeping in a garden, but was
chased away by a dog.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,840
Finally, he found himself in the cathedral
square.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,710
He shook his fist at the church and then,
cold and hungry, he lay down on a stone bench

51
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,900
by the doorway.

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,560
A few minutes later, an old woman came out
of the cathedral and saw him lying there.

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,580
'What are you doing?' she asked.

54
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,580
He answered angrily, 'Can't you see?

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,410
I'm trying to sleep.'

56
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,760
'On this bench, in this cold wind?'

57
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,700
'I've slept for nineteen years on a piece
of wood.

58
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Now it's stone.

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
What's the difference?'

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,840
'Why don't you go to an inn?'

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,400
'Because I haven't any money,' he lied.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,970
The old woman opened her purse and gave him
a few coins.

63
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,510
Then she said, 'Have you tried everywhere?'

64
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,960
'I've knocked at every door.'

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,560
'What about that one over there?'

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,480
she said, pointing across the square to a
small house beside the bishop's palace.

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
***

68
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,850
The Bishop of Digne was a kind old man who,
many years earlier, had given his palace to

69
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,620
the town hospital.

70
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:07,480
He lived a simple life with his sister, Mademoiselle
Baptistine, and his old servant, Madame Magloire,

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,680
and he was much loved by the people in the
town.

72
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,850
He trusted everyone.

73
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:19,290
His doors were never locked, so that anybody
who needed his help could find him easily.

74
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:26,780
That evening, Mme Magloire was chatting with
Mile Baptistine before serving the meal.

75
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,690
'People say there's a stranger in town,' she
said.

76
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,140
'The police say that he looks dangerous, and
it would be better for everyone to lock their

77
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,910
windows and doors.'

78
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,910
'Brother.'

79
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,250
Mile Baptistine turned to the bishop, who
was sitting by the fire.

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,470
'Did you hear what Mme Magloire was saying?'

81
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:56,490
'Something about a dangerous stranger walking
the streets?' he asked with an amused smile.

82
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,840
'This is no joke,' Mme Magloire said.

83
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,400
'The man is in rags and has an evil look on
his face.

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,870
Everybody in the town agrees that something
terrible will happen tonight.

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,620
And your sister agrees with me that this house
isn't safe.

86
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,191
If you like, I can make arrangements now to
get a lock put on the door

87
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:25,600
Before the bishop could reply, there was a
heavy knock on the door.

88
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,300
'Come in,' said the bishop.

89
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,540
The door opened and Jean Valjean, the stranger,
walked in.

90
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,580
Mme Magloire trembled, open-mouthed with fear,
while Mile Baptistine rose from her seat with

91
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,400
alarm.

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,520
The bishop, however, looked calmly at his
unexpected visitor.

93
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,970
'My name is Jean Valjean,' the stranger said
before anybody could speak.

94
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,370
'I've been in prison for nineteen years.

95
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,240
They let me out four days ago.

96
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:11,270
I've been walking all day, and nobody in this
town will give me food or a bed for the night.

97
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,741
A woman saw me lying on a stone bench across
the square and suggested that I come here.

98
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:21,400
So here I am.

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,330
What is this place?

100
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,960
Is it an inn?

101
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,210
I've got money.

102
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,919
Will you let me stay?'

103
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,620
'Mme Magloire,' said the bishop, 'will you
please prepare another place at the table

104
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,650
for this gentleman?'

105
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,190
Valjean took a step forward.

106
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,530
'No, you don't understand,' he said.

107
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,630
'I've spent five years in prison for violent
robbery, another fourteen years for trying

108
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,620
to escape four times.

109
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,730
I'm a dangerous man.'

110
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:02,300
'Mme Magloire,' the bishop went on, 'you must
put clean sheets on the bed in the spare room.'

111
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:09,820
Mme Magloire, an obedient servant, left the
room without protest.

112
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,020
The bishop turned to the man.

113
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,220
'Sit down and warm yourself, Monsieur.

114
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,139
Supper will soon be ready.'

115
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:26,130
Jean Valjean's face, which had been hard and
fierce, suddenly softened.

116
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,190
'You really mean it?' he asked, his voice
trembling with childish excitement.

117
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,919
'You'll let me stay?

118
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,050
I'm a dangerous criminal, but you called me
"Monsieur".

119
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,820
I don't believe it.

120
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,020
May I ask your name, sir?

121
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,810
Are you an innkeeper?'

122
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,920
'I'm a priest,' said the bishop.

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,589
'And this is where I live.'

124
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:55,810
'A priest?'

125
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,790
Valjean said, sitting by the fire.

126
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,880
'So I don't have to pay?'

127
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,710
'You can keep your money,' the bishop replied.

128
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:13,440
During dinner, Mile Baptistine looked at Valjean
kindly while the bishop talked about the local

129
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,580
cheese-making industry.

130
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,370
Valjean was so hungry that, at first, he paid
no attention to anyone.

131
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,510
Soon, however, he began to relax, and looked
around the room.

132
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,010
'This is not the house of a rich man,' he
thought.

133
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,200
'And the travellers in the inn eat better
than this.'

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,000
But then he looked at the table, and saw the
beautiful silver candlesticks, knives and

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,710
forks.

136
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,830
After dinner, the bishop said goodnight to
his sister, picked up one of the two candlesticks

137
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,860
and, handing the other to his guest, said,
'I'll show you to your room, Monsieur.'

138
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,330
Valjean followed the bishop upstairs into
a bedroom.

139
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,610
This was the bishop's bedroom.

140
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,200
As he was following the bishop across the
room, however, he noticed Mme Magloire putting

141
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,940
the silver knives and forks in a cupboard
by the bed.

142
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,080
The bishop showed his guest into the spare
room.

143
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,570
'Sleep well,' he said.

144
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:29,010
'Before you leave tomorrow, you must have
a bowl of warm milk from our cows.'

145
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:36,050
Valjean was so tired that he fell asleep,
fully-dressed, on top of the sheets, but he

146
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,000
didn't sleep for long.

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,380
When he woke up, the cathedral clock was striking
two, but he had not woken because of this.

148
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,900
He had woken because the bed was too comfortable;
he had not slept in a proper bed for twenty

149
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,510
years.

150
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:03,060
Unable to return to sleep, he gazed into the
darkness, thinking about the past twenty years.

151
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,970
Life had been unjust to him, and he was angry.

152
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,370
In 1795, he had lost his job as a tree-cutter.

153
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:20,160
At that time he was looking after his sister,
whose husband had died, and her seven children.

154
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,860
Out of work, and with no food in the house,
he had been arrested for trying to steal a

155
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,580
loaf of bread.

156
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,341
Now, at last, he was free, but he felt bitter
and angry about his lost years.

157
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:41,040
The world had been unfair to him, and he wanted
revenge.

158
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,210
Then, remembering the silver on the bishop's
table, he had an idea.

159
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,920
He sat up, swung his feet to the floor and
slowly stood up.

160
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,260
The house was silent.

161
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,230
He moved carefully towards the window and
looked out.

162
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:06,910
The night was not very dark; there was a full
moon, hidden from time to time by large clouds

163
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,690
moving quickly across the sky.

164
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,520
After studying the garden, he decided that
escape would be easy.

165
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:24,400
He turned back to the room, picked up his
bag and took out a short iron bar, sharpened

166
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,240
at one end.

167
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,940
He then put his shoes into the bag and, grasping
the iron bar in his right hand, he moved quietly

168
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,680
towards the door of the bishop's bedroom.

169
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,540
It was half-open.

170
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,370
The bishop had not closed it.

171
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,760
Valjean stood listening.

172
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,370
There was no sound.

173
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,710
He gave the door a gentle push and crept into
the bedroom.

174
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,370
Just as he reached the side of the bishop's
bed, the moon came out from behind a cloud

175
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,270
and filled the room with light.

176
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:10,670
Valjean gazed down at the bishop's gentle,
sleeping face, and felt a kind of terror.

177
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:18,980
He had never before seen such peace, such
kindness, such trust.

178
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,839
He suddenly turned away and moved quickly
to the cupboard.

179
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,830
The first thing he saw when he opened the
door was the basket of silver.

180
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,710
He grabbed it, hurried back to the spare bedroom,
picked up his stick and bag, climbed out of

181
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:42,010
the window, emptied the silver into his bag
and threw the basket into the garden.

182
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:49,700
A minute later he climbed the garden wall
and disappeared into the trees.

183
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,850
Early the next morning, while the bishop was
studying the flowers in his garden, Mme Magloire

184
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,500
ran out of the house with a look of alarm
on her face.

185
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,450
'Monseigneur, do you know where the silver-basket
is?'

186
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,250
'Yes,' said the bishop.

187
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,770
'I found it in one of the flowerbeds.'

188
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,310
'But it's empty!'

189
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,310
she cried.

190
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,610
'Where's the silver?'

191
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,400
'Oh, you're worried about the silver?

192
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,440
I don't know where that is.'

193
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,830
'Heaven save us, it's been stolen!'

194
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,830
she cried.

195
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,540
'The man who came last night!

196
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,600
He's run off with our silver!'

197
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,760
The bishop, who had been bending sadly over
a plant damaged by the basket, looked up and

198
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,870
said gently, 'I think I was wrong to keep
the silver for so long.

199
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,230
It really belongs to the poor.

200
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:52,040
I should have given it away a long time ago.'

201
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,459
Later that morning, as the bishop and his
sister were having breakfast, there was a

202
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,900
knock on the door.

203
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,730
Four men walked into the room.

204
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:08,010
Three of them were policemen; the fourth was
Jean Valjean.

205
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,680
'Monseigneur... ' the sergeant in charge of
the group began.

206
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
Valjean raised his head with surprise.

207
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
'Monseigneur?'

208
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,769
he repeated.

209
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,410
'I thought he was a priest.'

210
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,760
'Silence,' said one of the policemen, 'This
is the Bishop of Digne.'

211
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,740
The bishop, meanwhile, had moved towards the
group of men and was smiling at Jean Valjean.

212
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,140
'I'm delighted to see you again, dear friend,'
he said.

213
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,800
'But what about the candlesticks?

214
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,650
I gave you those as well, don't you remember?

215
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,740
They're silver like the rest, and worth at
least two hundred francs.

216
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,590
Did you forget to take them?'

217
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,720
Jean Valjean's eyes widened with disbelief.

218
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,399
'Monseigneur,' said the sergeant, 'do I understand
that this man was telling the truth?

219
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,190
We found this silver in his bag, and

220
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:14,810
'And he told you,' the bishop finished the
sentence for him, 'that an old priest had

221
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,430
given it to him?

222
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,810
Yes, he was telling the truth.'

223
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,660
'So this man isn't a thief?

224
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,130
'The sergeant looked as surprised as Valjean.

225
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,630
'Not at all.

226
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,660
So you can let him go at once.'

227
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,970
The policemen let go of Valjean's arms.

228
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,680
He moved his feet nervously, uncertain of
what to say at first.

229
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,899
Then he murmured, 'Am I really free to go?'

230
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:49,910
'Of course,' said the bishop.

231
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,570
'But this time, you mustn't forget your candlesticks.'

232
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,610
He fetched them from a shelf and gave them
to Valjean.

233
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,490
'Now, go in peace,' he said softly.

234
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,889
The policemen left, but Valjean did not move.

235
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,779
He did not know what to think.

236
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:19,379
The bishop walked up to him and said in a
low voice, 'Don't forget that you've promised

237
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:22,709
to use the money to make yourself an honest
man.'

238
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:30,950
Valjean, who did not remember having made
such a promise, was silent.

239
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:39,659
'Jean Valjean,' the bishop continued, 'I've
bought your soul from the Devil, and have

240
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:44,570
given it to God.'

241
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,570
***

242
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,190
Jean Valjean left the town and ran into the
countryside, blindly following lanes and paths,

243
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,570
not realizing that he was running in circles.

244
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,700
He was filled with a strange kind of anger,
but he did not know why.

245
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,220
Finally, as evening fell, he sat on the ground,
exhausted, and gazed across the fields at

246
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,809
the distant mountains, wishing that he was
back in prison.

247
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:16,659
When he had been angry at the world, he had
felt calm and sure of himself.

248
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,830
But now, for the first time in twenty years,
a man had shown him great kindness, and he

249
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,429
did not know what to feel.

250
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,980
Suddenly, he heard the sound of singing.

251
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,769
A boy of about ten years old was coming along
a footpath with a small box on his back and

252
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:40,659
dirty knees showing through holes in his trousers.

253
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:46,639
As he sang, he threw a coin into the air and
caught it before it fell.

254
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:52,399
Not noticing Jean Valjean sitting by the side
of the path, he threw the coin higher into

255
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,419
the air.

256
00:18:54,419 --> 00:19:00,010
This time, however, he did not catch it and
it rolled along the ground towards Valjean,

257
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,529
who immediately put his foot on it.

258
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:07,149
The boy, unafraid, walked up to Valjean.

259
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:11,659
'Please, Monsieur, may I have my coin?'

260
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:15,559
'What's your name?' asked Valjean.

261
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,360
'Petit-Gervais,' said the boy, smiling trustfully.

262
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,269
'I'm a chimney sweep, and that money is all
I have.'

263
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:28,070
'Go away,' said Valjean.

264
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,110
'Please, Monsieur, that's my money.'

265
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,700
Valjean lowered his head and did not reply.

266
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
'My money!'

267
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,919
the boy cried.

268
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,480
'My piece of silver!

269
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,759
My coin!'

270
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,549
Valjean seemed not to hear him.

271
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,970
The boy seized his collar and shook him.

272
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,609
'I want my money!' he cried.

273
00:19:53,609 --> 00:20:00,460
Valjean slowly raised his head and stared
with a sort of amazement at the child.

274
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,539
Then, reaching for his stick, he said, 'Go
to Hell!'

275
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:16,450
The boy, suddenly afraid of the mad, fierce
look in Valjean's eyes, turned and ran.

276
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,490
Valjean stood for some time gazing emptily
around him at the sunset and the shadows moving

277
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,669
in on him.

278
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:30,429
Suddenly he shivered, as if he had become
aware for the first time of the icy wind.

279
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:37,229
He bent down to pick up his bag but, as he
did so, he caught sight of the silver coin,

280
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:40,570
half-buried by his foot in the earth.

281
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,019
It affected him like an electric shock.

282
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,110
'What's that?' he murmured.

283
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,989
He stared at the coin with a look of puzzlement,
as if he were trying to remember something.

284
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:59,970
Then, with a sudden movement, he bent down
and picked it up.

285
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:07,080
He looked around but could see nothing in
the darkness - just a purple mist rising slowly

286
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,779
from the fields.

287
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,220
He called the boy's name, but there was no
reply.

288
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,940
Within minutes he was running along the path,
shouting.

289
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,009
'Petit-Gervais!

290
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,070
Petit-Gervais!'

291
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,820
There was still no reply.

292
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,200
A short time later, he met a priest on horseback.

293
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,570
'Have you seen a boy go by?' he asked.

294
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,210
The priest shook his head.

295
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,210
'No.

296
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,799
Why do you ask?'

297
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,970
Valjean produced two five-franc pieces and
gave them to the priest.

298
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,330
'This is for your poor, Monsieur.

299
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,169
He was a boy of about ten, a chimney sweep.

300
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:50,639
Monsieur, you must report me to the police.

301
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,070
I'm a thief.

302
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,690
I stole money from him.

303
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,519
Here, let me give you more money

304
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:06,019
But before Valjean could produce more coins,
the priest rode away in terror.

305
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:11,850
Valjean looked for the boy for another hour,
running along the path, calling out his name,

306
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,549
but with no success.

307
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:18,750
Finally he stopped and sat, exhausted, on
a rock.

308
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,859
Then, his heart full of grief for what he
had done, he buried his face in his hands

309
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:32,729
and, for the first time in nineteen years,
he cried.

310
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:39,509
CHAPTER TWO
Fantine

311
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:47,169
On a spring evening in 1818, in the village
of Montfermeil, not far from Paris, two little

312
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:49,789
girls were playing on a swing outside a small
inn.

313
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:55,980
Their mother - a big, red-haired woman with
a plain face - sat on the doorstep of the

314
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,480
inn, watching them.

315
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,299
'You have two very pretty children, Madame,'
a voice said from close beside her.

316
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,479
The woman looked round and saw a young woman
with a child sleeping peacefully in her arms.

317
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:17,549
The mother was young and pretty, but she looked
poor and unhappy.

318
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:23,720
She did not smile, and lines of sadness ran
down the side of her pale cheeks.

319
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,749
Her clothes were old and dirty, and she wore
a tight, plain cap over her beautiful blonde

320
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:31,749
hair.

321
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:35,629
'Thank you,' said the woman.

322
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:37,580
'Why don't you sit down for a minute?

323
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,419
You look tired.

324
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:46,359
'When the young woman had sat down next to
her, the red-haired woman introduced herself.

325
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,879
'My name's Thenardier.

326
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:52,620
My husband and I manage this inn.'

327
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,899
'My names Fantine,' the young woman said.

328
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:05,779
'I used to work in Paris, but my husband died
and I lost my job.'

329
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:11,779
She could not tell Mme Thenardier the truth,
which was that she had been made pregnant

330
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:15,389
by a young man who had then abandoned her.

331
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:21,659
'I left Paris this morning to look for work
in Montreuil,' she continued.

332
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,159
'My little girl walked some of the way, but
she's very small.

333
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,729
I had to carry her and she's fallen asleep.'

334
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:38,789
As she spoke these words, she gave her daughter
a loving kiss, which woke her up.

335
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:43,139
The child's eyes were as wide and blue as
her mother's.

336
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:47,860
With a little laugh, she jumped off her mother's
lap and ran to play with the two girls on

337
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,779
the swing.

338
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,629
'What's your little girl's name?'

339
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:55,460
Mme Thenardier asked.

340
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,690
'Euphrasie - but I call her Cosette.

341
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,279
She's nearly three.'

342
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,240
The two women watched the children playing
together.

343
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,039
'Children make friends very easily, don't
they?'

344
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,929
Mme Thenardier smiled.

345
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,029
'Look at them.

346
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:14,919
They could easily be sisters.'

347
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,519
At these words, Fantine did a very strange
thing.

348
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:29,249
She took Mme Thenardiers hand and said, 'Will
you look after my daughter for me?'

349
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:35,149
Mme Thenardier looked at Fantine thoughtfully,
but said nothing.

350
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:38,809
'I can't take her with me,' Fantine continued.

351
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:45,250
'I have to find work, and that's not easy
with a child but no husband.

352
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,999
As soon as I find a job, I'll come and fetch
her.

353
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,100
Will you do that for me?

354
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,769
I could pay six francs a month.'

355
00:25:52,769 --> 00:26:01,909
Mme Thenardier still said nothing, but a man's
voice from inside the house called, 'We'll

356
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,399
take seven francs a month, and six months
in advance.'

357
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,049
Fantine agreed.

358
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:14,059
'And another fifteen francs for extras,' called
the man.

359
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:20,380
'You will have them,' said Fantine, assuming
that she was talking to Mme Thenardiers husband.

360
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,830
'I have eighty francs.'

361
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,960
'Does the child have enough clothes?'

362
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,320
the man asked.

363
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,360
'She has some beautiful clothes,' Fantine
replied.

364
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,679
'Plenty of everything and silk dresses like
a lady.

365
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,429
They're all in my bag.'

366
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,840
The man's face finally appeared in the doorway.

367
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,990
'Then we agree to look after her for you,'
he said.

368
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,570
The next morning, Fantine kissed her daughter
goodbye and left for Montreuil, crying as

369
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,789
if her heart would break.

370
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:00,610
'This money will be useful,'Thenardier said
to his wife.

371
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,220
'Now I can pay off all my debts and stay out
of prison.

372
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,239
I'm proud of you.

373
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:09,259
You set a very clever trap.'

374
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:16,049
'Without even intending to,' his wife replied.

375
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:23,259
One month later, Thenardier was short of money
again, so he took Cosette's beautiful silk

376
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:27,249
clothes to Paris and sold them for sixty francs.

377
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:33,409
The couple dressed Cosette in rags and gave
her very little food, which they made her

378
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,080
eat from a wooden bowl under the table.

379
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,049
The dog and the cat, who ate with her, were
her only companions.

380
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:49,859
Fantine, meanwhile, found work in Montreuil
and asked for news of her daughter every month.

381
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,929
The Thenardiers always replied that she was
in good health and very happy.

382
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:02,009
At the end of the year, however, Thenardier
was not happy with just seven francs a month;

383
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:08,059
he demanded twelve and Fantine paid without
protest, happy that her daughter was being

384
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,750
well cared for.

385
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:18,320
The Thenardiers, who were loving and gentle
to their own daughters, Eponine and Azelma,

386
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,419
treated Cosette like a slave.

387
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:27,990
They made her get up before dawn every day
and do all the dirty jobs around the house,

388
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:34,200
while Eponine and Azelma wore pretty clothes
and played with dolls.

389
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,210
By the age of five, Cosette had become a thin,
pale-faced, silent child.

390
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,799
Misery had made her ugly and only her beautiful
blue eyes remained.

391
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,899
The Thenardiers did not feel guilty about
treating Cosette badly because Fantine had

392
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,759
stopped sending them regular payments.

393
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,110
'The child is lucky to have a home at all,'
they told everybody.

394
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,809
'Without us, she'd be living on the streets.'

395
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:06,809
***

396
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:14,559
When Fantine first arrived in Montreuil, she
had immediately found work in a factory.

397
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,729
She rented a small room, sent money regularly
to the Thenardiers and, for a short time,

398
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,350
was almost happy.

399
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:29,009
She forgot many of her problems, and dreamt
only of Cosette and her plans for the future.

400
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:32,979
But her happiness did not last long.

401
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:37,639
Although she was careful to say nothing about
her daughter to anyone, other women at the

402
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:40,470
factory soon discovered her secret.

403
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:48,749
An unmarried woman with a child was a terrible
thing in those days, and Fantine lost her

404
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:49,749
job.

405
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:55,249
She tried to find work as a servant, but no
one would employ her.

406
00:29:55,249 --> 00:30:00,659
She finally managed to earn a little money
sewing shirts, but she was unable to send

407
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:04,720
money regularly to the Thenardiers.

408
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,870
That winter, Fantine saved money by not having
a fire, and developed a small, dry cough.

409
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,799
By the following winter, her debts had increased.

410
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,749
The Thenardiers wrote her a frightening letter
in which they told her that Cosette had no

411
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:27,119
clothes, and that they needed ten francs immediately
to buy her a new dress.

412
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:32,710
Fantine, who did not have ten francs, but
who was afraid that her daughter would freeze

413
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,450
to death, went to the barber's shop.

414
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:42,369
She took out her comb and let her blonde hair
fall down to her waist.

415
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:45,039
'Such beautiful hair!'

416
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,849
the barber said.

417
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:51,090
'How much will you give me for it?'

418
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,690
Fantine asked.

419
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,299
'Ten francs.'

420
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,510
'Then cut it off.'

421
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:02,759
After selling her hair to the barber, Fantine
was able to buy a woollen dress, which she

422
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,700
sent to the Thenardiers.

423
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,220
The Thenardiers, however, were very angry
- they had wanted money, not clothes.

424
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:18,029
They gave the dress to their daughter, Eponine,
and Cosette went on shivering.

425
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:23,089
A few weeks later, Fantine received another
letter from the Thenardiers.

426
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:29,539
This time they wanted forty francs because
Cosette was very ill and urgently needed medicine.

427
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:37,070
Fantine felt desperate; she did not know how
to obtain such a large sum of money.

428
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:42,450
As she was wandering around the town, desperately
trying to decide what to do, she noticed a

429
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,929
crowd of people in the market square.

430
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:50,600
She approached them without thinking, and
discovered that they had gathered around a

431
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,429
travelling dentist.

432
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:58,369
Forgetting her troubles for a moment, she
smiled at the dentist's humorous efforts to

433
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:02,809
sell the people of Montreuil false teeth.

434
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,210
Suddenly the dentist saw her.

435
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,119
'You've got lovely teeth,' he said.

436
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:15,570
'If you sold me your two front teeth, I'd
pay you forty francs.'

437
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,289
Fantine ran home, upset and disgusted.

438
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:28,409
'My hair will grow again,' she thought, 'but
teeth would be gone forever.'

439
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:35,149
But then she thought about her daughter, and
her own appearance suddenly seemed unimportant.

440
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:40,529
That evening, she visited the dentist at the
inn where he was staying, and allowed him

441
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,169
to remove her teeth.

442
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,109
Fantine could not sleep that night.

443
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:52,980
She sat on her bed, cold and shivering, and
looked at the two coins shining on the table.

444
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,610
Then she gave a blood-stained smile.

445
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,570
'I'm happy,' she told herself.

446
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,870
'My baby isn't going to die.'

447
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:11,669
Fantine earned less and less money from her
sewing, and the Thenardiers demanded more

448
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,460
and more money to look after Cosette.

449
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,830
Fantine spent whole nights crying.

450
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,830
What could she do?

451
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,940
She had sold her hair and her teeth; what
else could she sell?

452
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:33,229
And then she decided that she had no other
choice: she would have to sell herself.

453
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:38,559
She became a prostitute.

454
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,429
CHAPTER TREE
Monsieur Madeleine

455
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:52,489
One winter's evening, a toothless woman with
a grey face and flowers in her hair was arrested

456
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,679
for attacking a man in the street.

457
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,880
She was taken to the police station, where
Inspector Javert, the chief of police, sent

458
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,249
her to prison for six months.

459
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:07,629
'Please, M. Javert.'

460
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,890
The woman fell to her knees.

461
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,950
'I owe a hundred francs.

462
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:17,600
If I don't pay, my little girl will lose her
home and be thrown out on to the streets.

463
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,770
Please don't send me to prison.'

464
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:27,230
Javert listened to her coldly, then ordered
a policeman to take her away.

465
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,149
While the policeman was trying to drag her
to her feet, however, a voice from the shadows

466
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:36,510
said, 'One moment please.'

467
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:43,660
Javert looked up and saw Monsieur Madeleine,
one of the most important people in the town.

468
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:51,850
M. Madeleine had arrived mysteriously in Montreuil
one December evening in 1815.

469
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:59,380
He had no money but he had a revolutionary
idea: he knew a cheap and efficient method

470
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,810
of manufacturing glass.

471
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:08,090
Within a few months of his arrival, thanks
to his new idea, the glass-making factory

472
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,470
in Montreuil was making enormous profits.

473
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,740
With the money he made, M. Madeleine built
two new factories, which provided the town

474
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,320
with hundreds of new jobs.

475
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,970
He became a very wealthy man but lived a simple
life, using most of his money to build new

476
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,640
hospitals and schools.

477
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:38,610
He was so popular that, in 1820, the townspeople
elected him mayor of Montreuil.

478
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,470
There was one man, however, who did not like
M. Madeleine.

479
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,380
This was the chief of police, Inspector Javert.

480
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:54,620
He had always been suspicious of M. Madeleine,
and was sure that he had seen him somewhere

481
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,550
before, many years earlier.

482
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:03,430
But he kept his suspicions to himself, not
daring to say what he really believed: that

483
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:10,600
M. Madeleine was, in fact, a dangerous criminal
with a terrible past.

484
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:18,540
Now, years later, M. Madeleine was in the
police station, trying to save Fantine from

485
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
prison.

486
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,320
Fantine, however, was not grateful.

487
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,240
In fact, when she saw who it was, she spat
at him.

488
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,750
'You own the factory where I used to work!'

489
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,240
she shouted at him.

490
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,620
'I lost my job because of you.

491
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:40,820
Now I've become a bad woman, but what choice
did I have?

492
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:45,350
I'll never get my daughter back if I don't
make money.'

493
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:53,080
The mayor turned to Inspector Javert and said,
in a soft, firm voice, 'This woman must be

494
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
released.'

495
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,950
'That's impossible,' Javert replied.

496
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,520
'She attacked a man in the street, a respectable
citizen.

497
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,000
And now I've just seen her spit at you, the
mayor of our town.

498
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,140
A woman like this deserves to be punished.'

499
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:15,080
'But I saw what happened in the street just
now,' M. Madeleine said.

500
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,770
'It was the man's fault, not this woman's.

501
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,040
You should arrest him, not her.'

502
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,990
Javert argued with M. Madeleine for some time,
but finally gave in.

503
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:34,480
He walked angrily out of the room, leaving
the mayor and the prostitute alone together.

504
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,710
Fantine trembled, as confused as Javert had
been.

505
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:47,310
The man who had just saved her from prison
was also the man who had caused all her troubles.

506
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:53,840
The devil had suddenly decided to be kind,
and she did not know what to think.

507
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,090
'I heard what you said,' M. Madeleine said
to her.

508
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:05,920
'I honestly didn't know that you had lost
your job, but I'll try to help you now.

509
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,980
I'll pay your debts and arrange for your child
to return to you.

510
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,060
I'll give you all the money you need.

511
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,010
I'll make you happy again.

512
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:22,890
And I promise that, in the eyes of God, you
have never been a bad woman.'

513
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:28,530
Fantine gazed at M. Madeleine with tears in
her eyes.

514
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,500
After all her pain and suffering she had,
for the first time in her life, found kindness

515
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,020
in another human being.

516
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,870
At last she would be cared for, and she could
look forward to a life of happiness with Cosette.

517
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:49,300
Without a word, she fell to her knees and
kissed the back of M. Madeleine's hand.

518
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:55,500
M. Madeleine sent the Thenardiers 300 francs
and told them to send Cosette to Montreuil

519
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,230
immediately.

520
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:05,600
Thenardier, thinking that Fantine had suddenly
become rich, wrote back and demanded 500 francs.

521
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,900
M. Madeleine sent the money, but the Thenardiers
found even more dishonest excuses for not

522
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,190
sending Cosette back.

523
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,190
***

524
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,390
The weeks passed and, although she was happier
than she had been for a long time, Fantine

525
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,870
caught a fever.

526
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:30,700
Months of poverty and misery had made her
ill, and she soon became so weak that she

527
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,170
was unable to leave her bed.

528
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,970
'When shall I see Cosette?'

529
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,700
she kept asking M. Madeleine when he visited
her.

530
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:47,300
'Very soon,' he would reply, and her pale
face would light up with joy.

531
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,110
One morning, as M. Madeleine was making preparations
to leave for Montfermeil and to fetch Cosette

532
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,700
himself, he had a visitor.

533
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,750
Inspector Javert walked into his office, and
stood in silence waiting for him to look up

534
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,370
from his work.

535
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,790
'Well, Javert, what is it?'

536
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:11,010
M. Madeleine finally said.

537
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:16,170
'I've come to apologize, M. Madeleine,' the
inspector replied.

538
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,140
'What are you talking about?'

539
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,100
'I've treated you unjustly.

540
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,570
I was angry with you six weeks ago when you
told me to release that woman.

541
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:33,950
I wrote to the police headquarters in Paris
and told them about you.'

542
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,250
'Told them what about me?'

543
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:45,630
'Forgive me, M. Madeleine, but I believed
you were a man called Jean Valjean.

544
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:51,210
He was a prisoner I saw twenty years ago,
when I worked at a prison in Toulon.

545
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:57,060
After being released from prison, this Valjean
stole some silver from the Bishop of Digne

546
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,620
and robbed a small boy on a public footpath.

547
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,640
We tried to catch him, but he disappeared.

548
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:10,860
When you arrived in Montreuil, I felt sure
that you were this man, but now I know I was

549
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,720
wrong, and I'm sorry.

550
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,880
You will, of course, dismiss me from my job,
as I've shown that I don't deserve your trust.'

551
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:28,990
M. Madeleine, looking hard at Javert without
expression, said quietly, 'I'm afraid I don't

552
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,140
understand.'

553
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,570
'The police headquarters in Paris told me
that Jean Valjean was arrested last autumn

554
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,130
for stealing apples,' Javert explained.

555
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,700
He'd changed his name to Champmathieu and
had lived for several years in the village

556
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,700
of Ailly-le-Haut-Cloche.

557
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,910
Two ex-prisoners from Toulon recognized him
as Jean Valjean.

558
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:56,450
I visited the man in Arras prison, and I saw
for myself that he is indeed Jean Valjean.

559
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,070
Of course, he denies everything, but that's
not surprising.

560
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,770
If he's found guilty of stealing from the
bishop - who, as you know, died a couple of

561
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:11,050
years ago - and of robbing the small boy,
he'll spend the rest of his life in prison.'

562
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,160
M. Madeleine looked down at his papers.

563
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,560
'This matter is of no interest to me, Javert,'
he said casually.

564
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,850
'I'm sure you have other work to do.'

565
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,160
'I was going to the man's trial in Arras tomorrow,
'Javert said.

566
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,870
'But after this conversation, you must dismiss
me.'

567
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,690
M. Madeleine rose to his feet.

568
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:41,530
'Javert,' he said, 'you're an honourable man.

569
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,690
You made one small mistake, that's all.

570
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:50,260
I want you to continue your excellent work
as inspector of police.'

571
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,540
He offered Javert his hand, but the inspector
refused to take it.

572
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,130
Instead, he said, 'I've behaved unjustly towards
an innocent man.

573
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,710
I cannot shake his hand.'

574
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:10,280
With those words he bowed and left the office,
leaving M. Madeleine to stare at the papers

575
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,770
on his desk with an empty, puzzled look in
his eyes.

576
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:19,500
That afternoon, M. Madeleine visited Fantine.

577
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:26,780
She had a high fever, and was coughing badly,
but she still had only one thing on her mind.

578
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
'Cosette?'

579
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,780
she asked him.

580
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,270
'Very soon,' he assured her.

581
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,970
He sat by her bed for an hour and then, having
told the nurses to look after her, he returned

582
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,470
to his home.

583
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:50,020
He stayed awake all night, thinking of Javert's
story about Champmathieu.

584
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:58,160
The reader has probably already realized that
M. Madeleine was really Jean Valjean, and

585
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,820
M. Madeleine - as we shall continue to call
him for this part of the story - knew that

586
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:09,560
he could not let Champmathieu go to prison
for crimes he had not committed.

587
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,940
He knew - although he was not happy to admit
this - that he would have to go to Arras and

588
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,790
tell the truth.

589
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,140
He would lose everything that he had worked
so hard to achieve.

590
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:28,730
He would also have to break his promise to
Fantine about bringing Cosette from Montfermeil.

591
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,010
But what choice did he have?

592
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,490
The truth was more important than anything
else.

593
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,490
***

594
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,690
The next morning, M. Madeleine set off on
the long journey to Arras.

595
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,130
It took him more than twelve hours, and when
he arrived, he discovered that Champmathieu's

596
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,850
trial had already started.

597
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:56,210
The courtroom was full but, because he was
such an important man, M. Madeleine was allowed

598
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,390
to sit behind the judge's chair.

599
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,570
He watched as several witnesses swore on the
Bible that the man standing before the judge

600
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,190
was Jean Valjean.

601
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:13,880
Champmathieu, a large, simple-minded man,
denied everything when his chance came to

602
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,140
speak, but the crowd thought he was trying
to be funny.

603
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:24,540
The courtroom filled with laughter and Champmathieu
began to laugh himself, which did him no good

604
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,670
at all.

605
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:32,900
Finally, having heard all the evidence, the
judge called for silence.

606
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:39,730
He was preparing to announce his decision
when M. Madeleine, pale and trembling, stood

607
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,610
up and said:

608
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,960
'That man is not Jean Valjean.'

609
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,920
An excited whisper went around the courtroom
as everybody recognized M. Madeleine.

610
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,950
M. Madeleine waited for the whispers to stop
before announcing in a loud, clear voice that

611
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,320
he was Jean Valjean.

612
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:09,480
At first, no one believed him, but he managed
to persuade the court by skilfully questioning

613
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,280
each of the witnesses, revealing personal
information that only the real Jean Valjean

614
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,740
could have known.

615
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,110
When he had persuaded the court of the truth
of his confession, he was faced with a shocked

616
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,170
but respectful silence.

617
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:31,200
'I must leave now,' M. Madeleine finally said.

618
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,100
'I have important business to attend to.

619
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,920
You know where to find me, and I shall not
try to escape.'

620
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,540
Everybody stood to one side to let him pass
as he made his way towards the door.

621
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:53,600
When he had gone, the judge immediately allowed
Champmathieu to leave the court a free man.

622
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:00,670
Champmathieu went home in a state of total
confusion, thinking all men mad and understanding

623
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,690
nothing of what had happened.

624
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,690
***

625
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,320
At dawn the next day, M. Madeleine entered
Fantine's room.

626
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,730
'How is she?' he asked the nurse, who was
watching her as she slept.

627
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,240
'She seems better.

628
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,520
She's looking forward to seeing her child.'

629
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,230
'I haven't brought the child with me,' M.
Madeleine said.

630
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:31,550
'Then what can we say to her when she wakes
up?'

631
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,350
The nurse looked suddenly worried.

632
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:40,110
'It will destroy her if she doesn't see her
child now, after you promised to bring her.'

633
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,200
'God will guide me,' M. Madeleine sighed.

634
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,650
For some time M. Madeleine sat by the bedside
and watched Fantine while she slept.

635
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:56,080
She was breathing with great difficulty, but
her face looked peaceful and calm.

636
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,530
Suddenly, she opened her eyes and saw M. Madeleine.

637
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,530
'Cosette?'

638
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,110
she asked, with a soft smile.

639
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:10,950
'Later,' M. Madeleine said gently, taking
her hand.

640
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,030
'You're too weak to see her at the moment.

641
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,400
First you must get well.'

642
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,790
Fantine smiled, and began to talk dreamily
about her future life with her daughter, and

643
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,780
how happy they would be together.

644
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:32,650
But suddenly her face froze, and she stared
with horror at the door.

645
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:39,740
M. Madeleine, who was holding her hand, turned
and saw Inspector Javert.

646
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:45,210
Fantine, thinking that the inspector had come
for her, gripped M. Madeleine's hand tightly

647
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,380
and begged him to protect her.

648
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,410
'Don't be afraid.'

649
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,100
M. Madeleine tried to calm her.

650
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,550
'He hasn't come for you.'

651
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:00,270
Then, gently rising from his chair, he moved
towards Javert.

652
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:07,100
'I know what you've come for,' he said quietly
so that Fantine wouldn't hear.

653
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,470
'But give me three days, please.

654
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:13,300
That's all I ask.

655
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,720
Three days to fetch this unfortunate woman's
child.

656
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
I'll pay anything you like.'

657
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,740
'Do you think I'm stupid?'

658
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,130
Javert gave an unpleasant laugh.

659
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,320
'Three days to escape, you mean.'

660
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:33,700
Fantine, who had heard what M. Madeleine said,
despite his efforts to speak quietly, began

661
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,030
to tremble.

662
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,120
'To fetch my child?'

663
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,120
she cried.

664
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,110
'Isn't she here?

665
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,260
Nurse, answer me... where's my little Cosette?

666
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,350
I want to see her.

667
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,350
M. Madeleine

668
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:55,330
'Be quiet, you dirty prostitute,' Javert interrupted
her angrily.

669
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,490
'There is no Monsieur Madeleine.

670
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:02,980
This man's name is Jean Valjean, and he's
a criminal no better than you are.

671
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,950
And you can forget all that nonsense about
your child.

672
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:11,440
Fantine suddenly sat up.

673
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,730
She stared wildly at the two men, then turned
to the nurse.

674
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:21,100
She looked as if she was going to speak, but
no words came from her lips.

675
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:29,810
Instead, with a small sigh, she fell back
against her pillow and lay completely still.

676
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:36,820
Jean Valjean (as we must now call him) shook
Javert's hand from his collar and ran to the

677
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,580
bed.

678
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:45,010
He gazed into Fantine's eyes and knew immediately
that she was dead.

679
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:50,750
'You've killed her!' he cried angrily, turning
to Javert with a fierce look in his eyes.

680
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:56,980
'I didn't come here to argue,' Javert said,
stepping back nervously, afraid that Valjean

681
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,310
was going to attack him.

682
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:04,370
'If you don't come with me now, I'll have
to call my men.'

683
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:08,330
Valjean looked around the room, thinking for
a second of making his escape.

684
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:12,420
But the idea did not last for long.

685
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,620
He turned again to Fantine and looked for
one last time at her sad, pale face and empty,

686
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,850
blue eyes.

687
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:25,829
Bending down, he closed her eyes and pressed
his lips against her forehead.

688
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:30,700
Then he rose and turned back to Javert.

689
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,120
'I'm ready now,' he said.

690
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,120
News of M. Madeleine's arrest spread quickly
around the town.

691
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,330
Most people pretended not to be surprised.

692
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:48,170
'We always knew there was something strange
about him,' they said.

693
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:55,190
Two days after his arrest, Jean Valjean escaped
from prison.

694
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,750
The bars of his window had been broken during
the night.

695
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:03,050
Again, most people pretended not to be surprised.

696
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:12,820
'It takes more than a small town prison to
hold a man as strong as that,' they all agreed.

697
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:19,220
CHAPTER FOUR
The Man in the Long Yellow Coat

698
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:26,200
Christmas 1823 was especially lively and colourful
in the village of Montfermeil.

699
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,160
Entertainers and traders from Paris set up
their stalls in the streets, and business

700
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,780
at the Thenardiers' inn was very good.

701
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:41,131
While guests and visitors ate and drank noisily,
Cosette - now eight years old - sat in her

702
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:43,910
usual place under the kitchen table.

703
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:51,280
Dressed in rags, she knitted woollen stockings
for Eponine and Azelma.

704
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,700
One evening, Madame Thenardier ordered Cosette
out into the cold to fetch water.

705
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:02,640
The nearest water supply was half-way down
the wooded hill on which Montfermeil stood,

706
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,980
and Cosette hated fetching water, especially
in the dark.

707
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:13,140
Miserably, she picked up a large, empty bucket
that was almost as big as she was, and was

708
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,620
walking with it to the door when Madame Thenardier
stopped her.

709
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,920
'Buy some bread on the way,' she said, giving
the girl some money.

710
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,900
Cosette took the coin, put it carefully in
her pocket and left.

711
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:33,510
She was cold and hungry as she dragged the
bucket behind her along the crowded street,

712
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,440
but she could not resist stopping in front
of one of the stalls.

713
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,810
It was like a palace to her, with its bright
lights, shining glass and pretty objects.

714
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:49,330
But the object that most attracted Cosette's
attention was a large, golden-haired doll

715
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,130
in a beautiful long pink dress.

716
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:58,580
All the children in Montfermeil had gazed
with wonder at this doll, but nobody in the

717
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,400
village had enough money to buy it.

718
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,970
Cosette gazed at the doll for several minutes
but, remembering her job, she sighed and continued

719
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,520
on her way.

720
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,280
She had soon left the colourful lights and
the happy laughter of the village behind her,

721
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,400
and was running down the hill into the frightening
darkness of the wood.

722
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,800
Finding the stream, she bent forward and began
to till her bucket.

723
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,690
She did not notice the coin that Mme Thenardier
had given her for the bread fall out of her

724
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,710
pocket into the water.

725
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:41,400
When the bucket was full, she gripped the
handle with her tiny, frozen hands and tried

726
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,840
to pull it back up the hill.

727
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:51,040
But the bucket was so heavy that, after a
dozen steps, she had to stop for a rest.

728
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,680
She managed a few more steps, and stopped
again.

729
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,369
Her progress became slower and slower.

730
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:06,270
She was almost at the end of her strength,
and she was still not out of the wood.

731
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,130
Leaning against a tree, she cried aloud:

732
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,860
'Oh God help me!

733
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,650
Please, dear God!'

734
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:21,980
Suddenly, an enormous hand reached down from
the sky and took the bucket of water from

735
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,820
her.

736
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:29,760
Looking up, Cosette saw a huge, white-haired
man standing next to her.

737
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,840
He looked very strange with his tall black
hat and long yellow coat.

738
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:43,100
'This is a very heavy bucket for such a small
child,' he said gently, looking down at her

739
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,840
from his great height.

740
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,980
For some reason, Cosette was not afraid.

741
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:55,420
There was something about his eyes, tilled
with a strange sadness, that she liked and

742
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,020
trusted.

743
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,420
She let him carry the bucket up the hill and,
as they walked back towards the village, she

744
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,270
told him everything about her life with the
Thenardiers.

745
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:12,990
The old man listened with great interest,
and asked her many questions.

746
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:18,600
As they were approaching the inn, Cosette
turned to him and said, 'May I have the bucket

747
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,860
now?

748
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:26,150
If Mme Thenardier sees that someone has been
helping me, she'll beat me.'

749
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,170
The old man gave her the bucket, and they
entered the inn together.

750
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,960
'What took you so long?'

751
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,119
Mme Thenardier said angrily when she saw the
little girl.

752
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,770
'This gentleman wants a room for the night,'
Cosette said, trembling with fear, expecting

753
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,340
to be beaten.

754
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,000
Mme Thenardier glanced at the old man without
interest.

755
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,300
She could tell from his clothes that he probably
had no money.

756
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,950
'I'm sorry, the rooms are full,' she said.

757
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:02,630
'I can pay the price of a room,' the old man
said.

758
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:09,960
'Forty sous,' Mme Thenardier replied (although
the usual price was twenty).

759
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,350
'Forty sous,' the man agreed.

760
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:19,090
He sat down and Cosette, after serving him
some wine, returned to her place under the

761
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,390
table.

762
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:27,410
But before she could start her knitting, she
heard Mme Thenardier's angry voice demanding,

763
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,850
'Where's the bread I told you to get?'

764
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:35,530
Cosette, who had forgotten about the bread,
came out from under the table.

765
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,450
'The baker's was shut,' she lied.

766
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,910
'Well, give me back the money.'

767
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:47,160
Cosette felt in her pocket and suddenly went
pale.

768
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,910
The coin was not there.

769
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:53,170
'I'm waiting,' Mme Thenardier said threateningly.

770
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:59,390
Cosette said nothing, speechless with fear
as the woman raised her arm to hit her.

771
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:03,720
But before she could deliver the blow the
old man, who had seen everything, interrupted

772
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,750
her.

773
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:09,400
'Madame, I've just noticed this on the floor.

774
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,100
It must have fallen from the child's pocket.'

775
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:19,550
Mme Thenardier took the coin the old man held
towards her and walked away.

776
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:25,670
At that moment the door opened and Eponine
and Azelma appeared.

777
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:31,850
They were two healthy girls, the old man noticed,
dressed in warm clothes and with pink, healthy

778
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:32,850
cheeks.

779
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:37,310
After hugging and kissing their mother, they
sat on the floor by the fire and played with

780
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:38,830
a doll.

781
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:43,500
Cosette, who had returned to her place under
the table, looked up from her knitting and

782
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,080
watched them sadly.

783
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:49,710
A short time later, the girls grew bored with
their game.

784
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:54,450
They left the doll on the floor and went off
to play with a baby cat.

785
00:58:54,450 --> 00:59:00,270
Cosette, checking that no one was watching,
reached out and picked up the doll.

786
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,930
She turned her back on the room and began
to play with it, hoping that no one could

787
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,640
see what she was doing.

788
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,780
Her happiness did not last long, however.

789
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:16,940
The two girls, when they saw Cosette with
their doll, ran crying to their mother.

790
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:22,180
Mme Thenardier rushed across the room towards
Cosette who, afraid that she would be punished,

791
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,100
put the doll gently on the floor and began
to cry.

792
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,480
'What's the matter?'

793
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,990
the old man said, rising to his feet.

794
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,620
'Can't you see?'

795
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,440
Mme Thenardier said, red with anger.

796
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,670
'That nasty little girl, who isn't even my
own daughter, who I feed and look after out

797
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,680
of the kindness of my heart, has been playing
with my daughters' doll.'

798
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,190
'I don't understand,' the old man said.

799
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:53,180
'She's touched it with her dirty hands!'

800
00:59:53,180 --> 01:00:00,930
Then, hearing Cosette crying, she turned to
the little girl and shouted, 'Stop that noise!'

801
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:08,270
The old man left the inn and, minutes later,
returned with something in his hands: the

802
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:11,360
beautiful doll from the stall across the road.

803
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:17,960
'Here,' he said softly, placing it gently
on the floor in front of Cosette.

804
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,020
'It's for you.'

805
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,940
There was a sudden silence in the room.

806
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:29,130
Mme Thenardier, Eponine and Azelma stood absolutely
still.

807
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:35,210
The drinkers at the other tables paused, glasses
half-way to their lips, and stared with disbelief.

808
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,830
'What kind of man is this?'

809
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:38,930
they thought.

810
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:46,820
'He dresses so poorly but can afford to buy
the most expensive doll in Montfermeil!'

811
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,710
The Thenardiers gave the old man their best
room for the night.

812
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:56,720
The next morning they gave him the bill, charging
him three times the usual price for a meal

813
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,210
and a bed for the night.

814
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:04,260
They waited nervously while the man studied
the bill carefully, expecting him to complain

815
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,130
or cause trouble.

816
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:13,160
Finally, he looked up from the bill without
expression and said, 'Tell me, is business

817
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,710
good here in Montfermeil?'

818
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:21,100
'Times are very hard,' Mme Thenardier replied
immediately.

819
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,160
'This is a poor country.

820
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,010
I don't know how we would manage without the
occasional rich and generous traveller like

821
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,060
yourself.

822
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,520
We have so many expenses.

823
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,050
That child, for instance - you've no idea
how much she costs.

824
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,060
We have our own daughters to look after.

825
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,270
I can't afford to look after other people's
children, too.'

826
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:50,040
'What would you say,' the old man said after
a moment's thought, 'if I offered to take

827
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,680
the child from you?'

828
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,390
'Oh!'

829
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,230
Madame Thenardiers face brightened.

830
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:58,609
'That would be wonderful.'

831
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:01,640
'Just a minute,' her husband said.

832
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,530
'We love that child very much.

833
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:10,140
It's true we're poor, and we have bad debts,
but love is more important than money.'

834
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,060
'How much do you need?'

835
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:17,590
the old man asked, taking an old leather wallet
from the pocket of his coat.

836
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:25,390
'1500 francs,' Thenardier, who had already
done his arithmetic, replied.

837
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:31,970
The old man put three 500-franc notes on the
table and said, without smiling, 'Now fetch

838
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:34,590
Cosette.'

839
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:41,600
When Cosette came downstairs, the old man
gave her new clothes to wear: a black woollen

840
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,170
dress, black stockings, scarf and shoes.

841
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:50,600
Half an hour later, the people of Montfermeil
saw an old man in a tall hat and long yellow

842
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:58,790
coat walking along the road to Paris, hand-in-hand
with a little girl dressed completely in black.

843
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,460
No one knew the man.

844
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:06,950
And, because she was carrying an expensive
doll and was no longer wearing rags, not many

845
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,170
recognized Cosette.

846
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,690
Cosette was leaving at last.

847
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,890
She did not know where to, or with whom.

848
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:22,119
But, as she held the old man's hand, she gazed
wide-eyed at the sky.

849
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:28,590
She had the strange but comforting feeling
that she was somehow travelling closer to

850
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:33,080
God.

851
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:40,100
CHAPTER FIVE
Valjean and Cosette

852
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:45,130
Somewhere on the outskirts of Paris, Jean
Valjean stopped outside a large, ancient building

853
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,470
with damp walls.

854
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:53,450
He took a key from the pocket of his long
yellow coat and opened the old wooden door.

855
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:59,210
He then carried Cosette, who was sleeping
in his arms, along a dark corridor and up

856
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:04,690
some stairs to the room he had rented since
his escape from Montreuil.

857
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:10,880
There was not much furniture in the room - just
an old bed, a mattress on the floor, a table,

858
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,190
some chairs and a lighted stove.

859
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:21,109
A streetlamp shone through the only window,
lighting the dark interior of the room.

860
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:24,470
Valjean laid Cosette on the bed without waking
her.

861
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:29,430
He lit a candle and sat by the bed, watching
her while she slept.

862
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:34,690
He felt sad that Fantine had not lived to
see her child again, but happy that he had

863
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:39,240
been able to rescue her child from the terrible
Thenardiers.

864
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,390
He bent and kissed the sleeping child's forehead
just as, nine months earlier, he had kissed

865
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:48,090
her mother's.

866
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:53,540
The next morning, Cosette opened her eyes
and immediately started to get out of bed.

867
01:04:53,540 --> 01:05:00,109
'I'm coming, Madame,' she yawned, blinded
by the bright winter's sunlight that was shining

868
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:01,850
into the room.

869
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:09,050
Then, as her eyes adjusted to the light, she
saw the kind old face of Jean Valjean looking

870
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,460
down at her, and she relaxed.

871
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,580
'Of course!'

872
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,750
she cried with joy.

873
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,140
'It's all true.

874
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:20,330
I was afraid that it was just a dream.'

875
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:24,420
She hugged her doll and asked Valjean hundreds
of questions.

876
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:29,360
Finally, she asked him, 'Do you want me to
sweep the floor?'

877
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,830
'No,' he said.

878
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:34,630
'I just want you to enjoy yourself.'

879
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:40,850
The December days passed in great happiness
for Cosette and for Jean Valjean, too.

880
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:45,200
For twenty-five years he had been alone in
the world.

881
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,450
Nothing had ever touched his heart until he
had rescued Cosette.

882
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:55,660
Now, he discovered the greatest joy he had
ever known by just standing beside her bed

883
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,530
and looking at her innocent, trusting little
face.

884
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:04,180
He had discovered love.

885
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,180
***

886
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:09,450
After escaping from Montreuil, Jean Valjean
had taken all his money from the bank and

887
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:13,950
buried it in a forest near Montfermeil.

888
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:18,869
Although he was rich, he had chosen a room
in a poor part of Paris, where nobody would

889
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:20,190
find him.

890
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:25,570
His only neighbour was an old woman, who did
his housework and kept his stove burning.

891
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,990
Paying her six months in advance, he told
her that he was a ruined Spanish gentleman,

892
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:35,710
and that the little girl was his granddaughter.

893
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:39,270
Weeks passed, and the two lived happily.

894
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:44,180
Valjean gave Cosette lessons in reading and
writing, and spent hours watching her as she

895
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,470
dressed and undressed her doll.

896
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:51,460
To avoid being seen, he never went out during
the day.

897
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:57,670
He walked for a couple of hours every evening,
sometimes alone, sometimes with Cosette.

898
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:02,900
He often gave money to beggars, which was
unwise, because he soon became known in the

899
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:08,020
area as 'the beggar who gives money to beggars'.

900
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:13,030
One evening, towards the end of winter, Valjean
gave some money to a beggar sitting under

901
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,160
a streetlamp outside a church.

902
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:22,480
The beggar raised his face and stared hard
at Valjean for just a second, then quickly

903
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,590
bowed his head.

904
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:27,650
This gave Valjean a shock.

905
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:34,430
Although he had only seen the beggar's face
for a second, it had seemed strangely familiar.

906
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:38,950
'I'm going mad,' he thought, as he walked
home.

907
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:43,280
The next evening he returned to the steetlamp
outside the church.

908
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,720
The beggar was still there, in the same position,
wearing the same clothes.

909
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,860
This time, Valjean spoke to him as he gave
him some money.

910
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:58,720
The beggar laughed and joked with him, and
Valjean returned that evening a happier man.

911
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,970
'I must have been dreaming yesterday,' he
laughed to himself.

912
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:11,250
'But for a second, there was something about
the beggars eyes that reminded me of Javert.

913
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,230
How could I have thought such a thing?

914
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:18,400
After speaking to him this evening, I can
see that he doesn't look like the inspector

915
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,299
at all.'

916
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:26,880
A few evenings later, while he was giving
Cosette a reading lesson in his room, Valjean

917
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,349
heard the front door of the house open and
close.

918
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:32,679
This was unusual.

919
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:37,339
The old woman, the only other person who lived
in the building, always went to bed before

920
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:39,380
nightfall.

921
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:43,349
Valjean signalled to Cosette to keep quiet.

922
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:46,100
Someone was coming up the stairs.

923
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,609
He blew out the candle and, just as he was
kissing Cosette on the forehead, the footsteps

924
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:53,580
stopped.

925
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,430
Valjean did not move.

926
01:08:55,430 --> 01:09:00,290
He sat in his chair with his back to the door
and held his breath.

927
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:04,729
A few minutes later, having heard only silence,
he turned round.

928
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:09,909
A light was shining through a crack in his
door.

929
01:09:09,909 --> 01:09:15,429
Someone with a candle was standing outside
his room.

930
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:20,599
Several minutes passed, and then the light
disappeared.

931
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:25,829
Valjean quietly lay down on the mattress on
his floor, but he could not close his eyes

932
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,339
all night.

933
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:34,049
At daybreak, as he was falling asleep at last,
he heard footsteps in the corridor outside

934
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,529
his room again.

935
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:42,489
Running to the door, he put his eye to the
large keyhole and saw the back view of a man

936
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:44,589
who was walking towards the stairs.

937
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:51,199
A tall man in a long coat with a stick under
his arm.

938
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:56,510
Valjean's heart almost stopped beating and
he began to sweat.

939
01:09:56,510 --> 01:10:02,179
'Javert,' he breathed to himself.

940
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:03,179
***

941
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,710
Valjean spent all day making preparations
to leave.

942
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:10,060
It was too dangerous for him and Cosette to
stay there another night.

943
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:15,280
That evening, he went downstairs and looked
up and down the street.

944
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,989
It seemed empty, although he could not see
into the shadows behind the trees.

945
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:26,460
He went back upstairs for Cosette, who was
waiting for him patiently, holding her doll.

946
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,849
'Come along,' he said.

947
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:32,650
'It's time to leave.'

948
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:37,199
Cosette took his hand, and went with him down
the stairs.

949
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:44,360
There was a full moon, and this pleased Valjean
as he moved quickly along the narrow streets.

950
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,079
By keeping close to the walls in the shadows,
he could clearly see what was happening in

951
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,010
the light.

952
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:55,449
After a while, he felt confident that he and
Cosette were not being followed.

953
01:10:55,449 --> 01:11:02,840
But, as the church bells of the city struck
eleven o'clock, something made him look back.

954
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:08,440
In the light of a lamp above a doorway, he
saw four men moving along the street in his

955
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,949
direction.

956
01:11:09,949 --> 01:11:13,610
He gripped Cosette's hand and began to walk
more quickly.

957
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:19,070
Every few minutes, he stopped in the shadows
of a doorway or at the corner of a street

958
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,130
to look back.

959
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,139
The four men were still following him.

960
01:11:24,139 --> 01:11:31,440
He could see their faces clearly in the moonlight,
and one of them belonged to Inspector Javert.

961
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,139
By now, Cosette was exhausted.

962
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:40,980
Valjean picked her up and ran with her through
a confusing system of alleys until he came

963
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,219
to a bridge.

964
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:48,150
On the other side of the river, he stopped
at the entrance of a high-walled alley and

965
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,030
looked back.

966
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:55,699
He could see four figures in the distance
on the far side of the bridge.

967
01:11:55,699 --> 01:12:00,900
Walking more slowly now, thinking he was safe
from his pursuers, Valjean followed the alley

968
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,679
until he came to a lane that seemed to lead
away from the city.

969
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,900
He walked along this lane for a long time
until, to his horror, he discovered his way

970
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,130
blocked by a high wall.

971
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:19,659
There was no way forward, but as he was turning
back, he saw movements in the distance and

972
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:22,880
the flash of moonlight on metal.

973
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:29,099
Seven or eight soldiers were moving slowly
along the lane in his direction.

974
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:33,949
Valjean looked desperately for an escape from
the alley, but could see none.

975
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:39,550
On one side of him was a tall building, all
its doors and windows covered with metal bars.

976
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:43,929
On the other side there was a wall, higher
than a tree.

977
01:12:43,929 --> 01:12:49,059
He would be able to climb the wall on his
own, but how could he carry Cosette?

978
01:12:49,059 --> 01:12:52,019
Suddenly, he had an idea.

979
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:58,900
He ran to a nearby streetlight and pulled
some wire from a metal box at its base.

980
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:06,420
He tied one end of the wire around Cosette's
waist, climbed the wall and, with great difficulty,

981
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,429
pulled the girl up behind him.

982
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:11,750
He was only just in time.

983
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:17,050
There was a tree on the other side of the
wall, and Valjean carried Cosette down into

984
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:21,510
its branches just as the soldiers arrived.

985
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,340
'He must be here!'

986
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,559
He heard Javert's voice clearly on the other
side of the wall.

987
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:28,619
'He can't have escaped.

988
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:30,679
There's no way out!'

989
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:37,400
At last, the soldiers gave up their search
and went back in the direction they had come.

990
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:46,289
Valjean hugged Cosette tightly with relief,
knowing that at last they were both safe.

991
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:51,249
CHAPTER SIX
Marius

992
01:13:51,249 --> 01:13:57,679
On the night after the Battle of Waterloo,
in June 1815, a robber moved quietly around

993
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:03,079
the battlefield, stealing money and jewellery
from the bodies of dead soldiers.

994
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:08,630
He saw a hand sticking out from a pile of
dead men and horses, a gold ring on its middle

995
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:11,249
finger, shining in the moonlight.

996
01:14:11,249 --> 01:14:18,090
The robber took the ring but, as he turned
to leave, the hand grabbed his jacket.

997
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:22,369
The robber pulled the body from the pile of
bodies and saw that he had rescued a French

998
01:14:22,369 --> 01:14:23,929
officer.

999
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:28,210
The man had a terrible wound in his head,
but he was still alive.

1000
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:31,860
'Thank you,' the officer whispered.

1001
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,469
'You've saved my life.

1002
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:37,860
What's your name?'

1003
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,579
'Thenardier,' the robber replied.

1004
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:45,469
'I shall not forget that name,' the officer
replied.

1005
01:14:45,469 --> 01:14:47,761
'And you must remember mine.

1006
01:14:47,761 --> 01:14:53,179
My name's Pontmercy.'

1007
01:14:53,179 --> 01:14:58,539
Without another word, the robber took the
wounded man's watch and purse, and disappeared

1008
01:14:58,539 --> 01:15:00,260
into the night.

1009
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,909
Georges Pontmercy was married with a young
son.

1010
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:12,199
He survived the Battle of Waterloo but unfortunately,
in the same year, his wife died.

1011
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:18,420
His father-in-law, M. Gillenormand, was a
very wealthy man, but the two men hated each

1012
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,420
other.

1013
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:24,059
M. Gillenormand hated everybody who liked
Napoleon.

1014
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:28,749
He thought that Pontmercy was no better than
a beggar, a penniless adventurer who only

1015
01:15:28,749 --> 01:15:30,030
wanted his money.

1016
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:35,639
Pontmercy thought that M. Gillenormand was
an old fool.

1017
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:43,519
When his daughter died, M. Gillenormand made
Pontmercy an offer which he could not refuse.

1018
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:47,380
'You have no money, and I am rich,' he said.

1019
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:53,309
'If you want to keep your son, Marius, I'll
give you no money.

1020
01:15:53,309 --> 01:16:01,030
But if you give the boy to me, and promise
never to see him again, I'll look after him.'

1021
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:07,760
Pontmercy, wanting his son to have a good
life, had sadly given him to M. Gillenormand

1022
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,999
and never saw his son or father-in-law again.

1023
01:16:12,999 --> 01:16:17,300
Marius grew up with his grandfather, and never
knew his father.

1024
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:22,699
M. Gillenormand always told him that his father
had been no good - that he was a poor soldier

1025
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:27,530
and a drunk who had abandoned him after his
mother's death.

1026
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:33,010
For many years, Marius believed this, but
when he was seventeen years old, he learnt

1027
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,449
the truth.

1028
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:39,179
His father, a brave officer who had fought
for Napoleon and nearly died at the Battle

1029
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:44,949
of Waterloo, had really loved him and his
mother very much.

1030
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:50,489
Without telling his grandfather, Marius tried
to contact his father and finally discovered

1031
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:52,460
where he was living.

1032
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:56,620
He went at once to visit him, but he was too
late.

1033
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,159
His father had just died.

1034
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:06,369
A poor man, Georges Pontmercy had left his
son nothing apart from a letter:

1035
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:08,119
For my son.

1036
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:11,599
My life was saved at Waterloo by a sergeant.

1037
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:14,360
His name was Thenardier.

1038
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:20,130
I believe that he recently managed a small
inn in the village of Montfermeil, not far

1039
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,860
from Paris.

1040
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:29,940
If you ever find this man, I want you to help
him in any way you can.

1041
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:35,061
Marius returned to Paris, but continued to
visit his father's grave regularly, without

1042
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:36,829
telling his grandfather.

1043
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:40,920
One day, however, his grandfather discovered
what he was doing.

1044
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:48,639
They had a big quarrel, and M. Gillenormand
ordered Marius to leave his house.

1045
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:49,639
***

1046
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:53,699
For the next three years, Marius lived in
a small room in an old, damp-walled building

1047
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:59,880
on the outskirts of Paris - the same room
that Valjean and Cosette had lived in eight

1048
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,309
years earlier.

1049
01:18:02,309 --> 01:18:07,260
He gave up studying law and earned his living
by working in a bookshop and helping to write

1050
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,730
dictionaries.

1051
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:13,440
He did not earn very much money, but it was
enough for the rent and simple meals.

1052
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:20,460
He rarely bought new clothes, but he was proud
of the fact that he had never been in debt.

1053
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:25,360
His grandfather often tried to send him money,
but Marius always returned it.

1054
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:32,300
He hated his grandfather for the unjust, cruel
way he had treated his poor father.

1055
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:37,579
Life was hard for him, but he never forgot
the promise he had made his father: that he

1056
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:43,520
would find Thenardier, the man who had saved
his father's life, and help him in any way

1057
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,389
he could.

1058
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:51,300
Marius was a handsome young man, but he was
also extremely shy.

1059
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:56,719
When girls looked at him and smiled, he thought
they were laughing at his old clothes.

1060
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:02,280
In fact, they were attracted by his good looks,
but he was not confident enough to realize

1061
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,280
this.

1062
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:09,949
As a result, he had no girlfriend, but he
was happy with his books.

1063
01:19:09,949 --> 01:19:15,199
'You shouldn't stay alone all the time,' his
good friend, Enjolras, said to him.

1064
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,090
'You should get out more.

1065
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,989
Give the girls a chance.

1066
01:19:18,989 --> 01:19:21,320
They'd be good for you, Marius.

1067
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,979
Otherwise you'll turn into a priest!'

1068
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:30,489
Marius paid little attention to his friend,
and continued his quiet life of work, study

1069
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:33,360
and daily walks.

1070
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:38,880
While walking around his part of the city,
Marius had noticed in elderly man and a young

1071
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,610
girl in the Luxembourg Gardens.

1072
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:44,889
They always sat next to each other on the
same bench.

1073
01:19:44,889 --> 01:19:51,519
The man, who was perhaps sixty, had white
hair and a serious but friendly-looking face.

1074
01:19:51,519 --> 01:19:57,489
The girl, who was aged thirteen or fourteen,
always wore the same badly-cut black dress.

1075
01:19:57,489 --> 01:20:05,119
She was very thin, almost ugly, but Marius
noticed that she had lovely blue eyes.

1076
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,789
They seemed to be father and daughter.

1077
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:12,780
Marius saw this couple frequently on his regular
walks in the Gardens.

1078
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:18,820
But, although he was very interested in them,
they seemed not to notice him at all.

1079
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:23,849
The girl was always talking happily, while
the man said very little.

1080
01:20:23,849 --> 01:20:29,630
He just looked at the girl from time to time
with an affectionate, fatherly smile.

1081
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:33,539
Enjolras had often seen the couple, too.

1082
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:36,500
'Do you know who they are?'

1083
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,110
Marius asked him one day.

1084
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:46,219
'I call the man M. Leblanc, because of his
white hair, and the girl Mile Lanoire, because

1085
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:51,340
of her black dress,' his friend replied.

1086
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,340
***

1087
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:56,500
For almost a year, Marius saw the old man
and the young girl daily in the same place

1088
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,070
at the same time.

1089
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:04,199
Then, for some reason, Marius stopped going
to the Luxembourg Gardens.

1090
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:10,429
When he returned, one summer morning six months
later, he saw the same couple sitting on the

1091
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:15,630
same bench, but something amazing had happened.

1092
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:21,989
The man was the same, but the thin, plain
girl of six months earlier had become a beautiful

1093
01:21:21,989 --> 01:21:22,989
young woman.

1094
01:21:22,989 --> 01:21:28,719
Her rough black dress had been replaced by
one of fine black silk.

1095
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:35,840
She had soft brown hair, pale, smooth skin,
deep blue eyes and a lovely smile that lit

1096
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,300
up her face like sunshine.

1097
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:44,619
She looked up when Marius passed for the second
time, and gave him a casual glance.

1098
01:21:44,619 --> 01:21:49,729
Marius, however, walked on, thinking of other
things.

1099
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:54,110
For the next few days he passed the bench
in the Gardens without looking at her.

1100
01:21:54,110 --> 01:22:00,409
Then one day, as he was passing, thinking
about nothing in particular, the girl looked

1101
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:03,040
up at him and their eyes met.

1102
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:11,239
A second later she looked away and Marius
walked on but, in a strange way, he knew his

1103
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:12,739
life had changed.

1104
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:19,030
What he had experienced in that moment was
not the honest, innocent gaze of a child.

1105
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:21,829
It was something more than that.

1106
01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:29,789
Whatever it was, Marius sensed that, after
that moment, his life would never be the same.

1107
01:22:29,789 --> 01:22:35,099
The next day, Marius returned to the Luxembourg
Gardens wearing his best clothes.

1108
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:40,750
He walked around slowly, stopping to look
at the ducks on the lake, then casually approached

1109
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:45,750
the bench where Mile Lanoire and her father
were sitting.

1110
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:51,389
As he walked past, he kept his eyes fixed
on the girl, but she did not seem to notice

1111
01:22:51,389 --> 01:22:52,389
him.

1112
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:57,619
She was talking quietly to her father, and
Marius could hear the soft, exciting murmur

1113
01:22:57,619 --> 01:22:59,989
of her voice.

1114
01:22:59,989 --> 01:23:06,320
Without intending to, he stopped, turned round
and walked past the bench again.

1115
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,229
He felt his face go red and his heart beat
loudly in his chest.

1116
01:23:10,229 --> 01:23:14,900
He was sure, this time, that she had watched
him as he passed.

1117
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:21,449
He did not go back a third time, but sat down
on a bench at the opposite end of the Gardens.

1118
01:23:21,449 --> 01:23:24,650
He looked at the girl out of the corner of
his eye.

1119
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:30,289
She seemed to fill the far end of the Gardens
with a kind of blue mist.

1120
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:35,389
Taking a deep breath, he rose and was going
to pass the bench for a third time when he

1121
01:23:35,389 --> 01:23:36,860
stopped.

1122
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:42,349
He suddenly realized that, in his feverish
state, he had forgotten about the old man.

1123
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:47,559
What would he be thinking when he saw a strange
young man walking backwards and forwards in

1124
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:50,280
front of his bench?

1125
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:56,050
Without another thought, Marius left the Gardens
and went home.

1126
01:23:56,050 --> 01:24:01,469
He returned the next morning and sat on a
bench all day, pretending to read a book,

1127
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:06,389
not daring to go near the bench where the
girl and her father were sitting.

1128
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:10,840
He did the same every day for two weeks.

1129
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,329
Towards the end of the second week, while
Marius was sitting in his usual place, he

1130
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:17,219
looked up from his book.

1131
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,889
And his face went pale.

1132
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:22,810
Something had happened at the far end of the
Gardens.

1133
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:28,590
M. Leblanc and his daughter had risen from
their bench and were slowly walking in his

1134
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,409
direction.

1135
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:35,760
Marius shut his book, opened it again and
made an effort to read.

1136
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,829
When he felt that they were near him, he looked
up and saw that the girl was looking steadily

1137
01:24:41,829 --> 01:24:48,760
at him with a soft, thoughtful gaze that made
him tremble from head to foot.

1138
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:54,309
He gazed after her until she had disappeared
from sight, then rose to his feet and walked

1139
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:58,130
around, laughing and talking to himself.

1140
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:03,070
Finally he left the Gardens in the mad hope
of seeing her in the street, but instead he

1141
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:08,139
met Enjolras, who invited him to a meal.

1142
01:25:08,139 --> 01:25:13,360
Every day for the next month, Marius went
to the Luxembourg Gardens, excited by knowing

1143
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:18,429
that the girl was secretly looking at him,
but too shy and embarrassed to know what to

1144
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:20,150
do.

1145
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:25,130
He avoided walking directly in front of the
bench, partly from shyness, partly because

1146
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:29,329
he did not want to attract her father's attention.

1147
01:25:29,329 --> 01:25:33,480
Sometimes he stood for half an hour in a place
where her father could not see him, looking

1148
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:39,760
at her and enjoying the small, secret smiles
she sent him.

1149
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,349
But it seemed that M. Leblanc had begun to
suspect what was happening because often,

1150
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:52,449
when Marius appeared, he got to his feet and
walked away, taking his daughter with him.

1151
01:25:52,449 --> 01:25:56,550
Sometimes M. Leblanc took his daughter to
a different bench, to see if Marius would

1152
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,989
follow them.

1153
01:25:58,989 --> 01:26:04,750
Marius failed to understand the trick, and
made the mistake of doing so.

1154
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:09,880
Then M. Leblanc became irregular in his visits
and did not always bring his daughter with

1155
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,730
him.

1156
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:17,969
When this happened, Marius did not stay in
the Gardens, which was another mistake.

1157
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:21,449
Marius was too much in love to think clearly.

1158
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:27,300
His desire for the girl was growing daily,
and he dreamt of her every night.

1159
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:32,499
One evening, he found a handkerchief lying
on the bench which M. Leblanc and his daughter

1160
01:26:32,499 --> 01:26:34,400
had just left.

1161
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:42,090
It was a plain, white handkerchief with the
initials U.F. in one corner.

1162
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,909
'Ursula.'

1163
01:26:43,909 --> 01:26:46,559
Marius said the first name that came into
his head.

1164
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:48,880
'A delicious name!'

1165
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:54,219
He kissed the handkerchief, breathed in its
perfume, wore it next to his heart by day

1166
01:26:54,219 --> 01:26:56,869
and kept it under his pillow at night.

1167
01:26:56,869 --> 01:27:02,459
'I can feel her whole soul in it!' he told
himself

1168
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:08,599
In fact, the handkerchief belonged to M. Leblanc
and had simply fallen out of his pocket, but

1169
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:11,650
Marius was unaware of this.

1170
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:16,050
He never appeared in the Luxembourg Gardens
without the handkerchief pressed to his lips

1171
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:17,929
or his heart.

1172
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:23,900
The girl could not understand his behaviour
at all, and looked at him with a puzzled expression.

1173
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,300
'Such modesty!'

1174
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,690
Marius sighed.

1175
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:33,900
Eventually, Marius was not satisfied with
just knowing the girl's name; he wanted to

1176
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,440
know where she lived.

1177
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:41,150
He found that she lived in a small house at
the quiet end of the rue de l'Ouest.

1178
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:47,780
As well as the joy of seeing her in the Gardens,
he now had the pleasure of following her home.

1179
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:53,389
One evening, having followed them to the house
and watched them enter, he went in after them

1180
01:27:53,389 --> 01:27:55,920
and spoke to the concierge.

1181
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,459
The concierge, however, became suspicious,
thinking that Marius was connected with the

1182
01:28:01,459 --> 01:28:05,719
police, and refused to say anything.

1183
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:11,019
The following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter
did not come to the Gardens at all.

1184
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:17,010
They did not come for a whole week, and Marius
began to feel depressed.

1185
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:22,690
Every night he stood outside their house and
gazed up at their lighted windows.

1186
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:28,849
Sometimes he saw a shadow pass in front of
a lamp, and his heart beat faster.

1187
01:28:28,849 --> 01:28:33,079
On the eighth night there was no light in
the windows.

1188
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:38,809
Marius waited, his heart aching with pain,
until finally going home.

1189
01:28:38,809 --> 01:28:43,849
The next day they did not go to the Gardens,
so again Marius went to the house as night

1190
01:28:43,849 --> 01:28:44,969
was falling.

1191
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:49,039
Once again, there were no lights in the windows.

1192
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:52,599
He knocked on the door and spoke to the concierge.

1193
01:28:52,599 --> 01:28:57,050
'Where's the old gentleman?' he asked.

1194
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:59,559
'He's left.'

1195
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:02,239
Marius felt the blood leave his face.

1196
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:07,530
Almost fainting, he asked in a weak voice,
'When did he leave?'

1197
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:08,530
'Yesterday.'

1198
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:11,320
'Where has he gone?'

1199
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,590
'I've no idea.'

1200
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:16,239
'Did he leave an address?'

1201
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:20,190
The concierge then recognized Marius from
the previous week.

1202
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:24,729
He stared fiercely at him and said, 'So, it's
you again!

1203
01:29:24,729 --> 01:29:26,559
I was right.

1204
01:29:26,559 --> 01:29:29,659
You are some kind of policeman.'

1205
01:29:29,659 --> 01:29:33,390
With those words he slammed the door in Marius's
face.

1206
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,270
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Jondrettes

1207
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:43,190
Summer and autumn passed, and winter came,
but Marius saw no sign of M. Leblanc or 'Ursula'.

1208
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:47,449
He searched everywhere for them, but without
success.

1209
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:52,389
He became like a homeless dog, wandering the
streets in a mood of dark despair.

1210
01:29:52,389 --> 01:30:00,840
Without 'Ursula', his life had become meaningless,
work disgusted him, walking tired him, solitude

1211
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,110
bored him.

1212
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:08,510
'If only I hadn't followed them home,' he
told himself.

1213
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:18,010
'It gave me so much happiness just to look
at her, and now, through my stupidity, I've

1214
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:19,090
lost even that.'

1215
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:28,150
Enjolras and his other friends tried to cheer
him up by taking him to exciting places, but

1216
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:33,219
these expeditions always ended in the same
way: Marius would leave the group and walk

1217
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:36,630
around the streets of Paris unhappily on his
own.

1218
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:43,150
One cold but sunny afternoon in February,
Marius was walking along the street when two

1219
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:46,130
young girls dressed in rags ran into him.

1220
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:49,460
One was tall and thin, the other smaller.

1221
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:55,710
From what they were shouting at each other,
he understood that they were running from

1222
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:56,710
the police.

1223
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:00,469
He stood for a moment staring after them as
they disappeared round a corner.

1224
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:05,199
Then he noticed a small parcel of papers lying
on the ground.

1225
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:12,659
Realizing that one of the girls must have
dropped it, he picked it up and called after

1226
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:15,300
them, but it was too late.

1227
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:19,229
The girls had already disappeared from sight.

1228
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:21,510
With a sigh, he put the package in his pocket
and went on to dinner.

1229
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:27,249
That night at home, Marius opened the package
and found that it contained four letters,

1230
01:31:27,249 --> 01:31:33,590
all addressed to different people, and smelling
strongly of cheap tobacco.

1231
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:39,709
Marius read the four letters and discovered
that they were all asking for money.

1232
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:45,750
However, there was something strange about
them: although they all seemed to be written

1233
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:52,610
by different people, they were written on
the same rough paper in the same handwriting.

1234
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:53,610
He also noticed that each of them had similar
spelling mistakes.

1235
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:57,349
Thinking no more about it, he wrapped the
letters up again, threw them into a corner

1236
01:31:57,349 --> 01:31:59,499
and went to bed.

1237
01:31:59,499 --> 01:32:08,550
The next morning, while he was working, there
was a gentle knock on his door.

1238
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:11,800
'Come in,' Marius said, expecting it to be
the concierge, Mme Bougon.

1239
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:16,369
But the voice that answered, saying, 'I beg
your pardon, Monsieur,' was not that of Mme

1240
01:32:16,369 --> 01:32:17,369
Bougon.

1241
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:21,340
It was more like the voice of a sick old man.

1242
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,380
Marius looked up quickly and saw that his
visitor was a thin girl wearing just a skirt

1243
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,380
and shirt.

1244
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:31,300
She looked cold and ill, and when she spoke,
Marius saw that she had lost several of her

1245
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,300
teeth.

1246
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,010
There was, however, still a trace of beauty
in the sixteen-year-old lace, like pale sunlight

1247
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:36,929
beneath the thick clouds of a winter's dawn.

1248
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:44,219
Marius rose to his feet, sure that he had
seen the girl somewhere before.

1249
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:47,380
'What can I do for you, Mademoiselle?'

1250
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,380
he asked.

1251
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:51,139
'I've got a letter for you, M. Marius.'

1252
01:32:51,139 --> 01:32:52,999
Marius opened the letter and read:

1253
01:32:52,999 --> 01:32:58,789
My warm-hearted neighbour, I have heard of
how you kindly paid my rent for me six months

1254
01:32:58,789 --> 01:32:59,789
ago.

1255
01:32:59,789 --> 01:33:00,809
I thank you for it.

1256
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:07,209
But my eldest daughter will tell you that
my wife is sick and none of us have had any

1257
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:09,249
food for four days.

1258
01:33:09,249 --> 01:33:14,380
Please, Monsieur, show us the kindness of
your generous heart again.

1259
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,559
My daughter is at your service.

1260
01:33:16,559 --> 01:33:17,559
Yours truly, Jondrette.

1261
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:24,579
Marius realized at once that the handwriting,
the yellow paper and the smell of cheap tobacco

1262
01:33:24,579 --> 01:33:29,230
was the same as in the four letters he had
read the previous evening.

1263
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:39,030
He now had five letters, all the work of one
author: the man who lived with his family

1264
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,389
in the next room.

1265
01:33:40,389 --> 01:33:50,650
The Jondrette family had been Marius's neighbours
for many months, but he had never before paid

1266
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,929
much attention to them.

1267
01:33:52,929 --> 01:34:00,079
This was why he had failed to recognize the
two daughters when they had run into him on

1268
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:01,079
the street.

1269
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:06,329
But now he understood that Jondrette's business
was writing dishonest letters, asking for

1270
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:08,249
money from people he imagined were wealthier
than himself.

1271
01:34:08,249 --> 01:34:12,409
Marius looked up from the letter and watched
the girl moving fearlessly around his room,

1272
01:34:12,409 --> 01:34:15,980
studying the furniture and the mirror on the
wall.

1273
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:19,110
Her eyes lit up when she noticed the books
on his writing desk.

1274
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:20,110
'Books!'

1275
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:24,869
she said, and then added with pride, 'I know
how to read and write.

1276
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:26,409
Look, I'll show you.'

1277
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:33,219
Picking up a pen that lay on the table, she
wrote on a piece of paper, Be careful!

1278
01:34:33,219 --> 01:34:34,559
The police are coming!

1279
01:34:34,559 --> 01:34:40,310
She showed Marius her work and then, changing
the subject quickly, for no reason at all,

1280
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:45,320
she gazed into his eyes and said shyly, 'Do
you know, M. Marius, that you're a very handsome

1281
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,320
boy?'

1282
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,719
Approaching him, she rested a cold red hand
on his shoulder and said, 'You never notice

1283
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:51,719
me, M. Marius, but I know you.

1284
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:58,670
I see you on the stairs, and I see you walking
around the streets, looking so sad and alone.'

1285
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,570
Marius's cheeks went red.

1286
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:07,409
He moved away from the girl's touch and said,
'I think, Mademoiselle, that I have something

1287
01:35:07,409 --> 01:35:08,409
belonging to you.'

1288
01:35:08,409 --> 01:35:10,219
He handed her the parcel of letters.

1289
01:35:10,219 --> 01:35:13,369
She clapped her hands and cried, 'We've been
looking for that everywhere!

1290
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:17,489
How did you know they were mine?

1291
01:35:17,489 --> 01:35:19,260
Of course, the handwriting.

1292
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:23,590
You were the man we ran into last night.'

1293
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:27,350
While she talked excitedly, she took out one
of the letters.

1294
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:29,769
'Ah, this is for the old man who goes to church
every day.

1295
01:35:29,769 --> 01:35:32,469
If I hurry, I might be able to catch him.

1296
01:35:32,469 --> 01:35:34,550
Perhaps he'll give me enough for a dinner.

1297
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:37,030
We haven't eaten for three days...

1298
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:38,030
'

1299
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:41,699
Marius took a five-franc piece from his pocket
and handed it to the girl.

1300
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:43,079
'The sun's come out at last!'

1301
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:44,449
she cried, eagerly accepting the coin.

1302
01:35:44,449 --> 01:35:45,820
'That's enough food for two days.

1303
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:46,959
You're a real gentleman, Monsieur.'

1304
01:35:46,959 --> 01:35:50,550
With those words, she gave a little laugh
and wave, grabbed some dry bread from the

1305
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:53,710
table and disappeared out of the door.

1306
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:54,710
***

1307
01:35:54,710 --> 01:36:00,059
Marius had lived for five years without much
money, but he had never been really poor.

1308
01:36:00,059 --> 01:36:04,479
Now, after his conversation with the girl
from the next room, he understood what real

1309
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:05,479
poverty was.

1310
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:11,070
Only a thin wall separated him from the family
of lost souls in the room next door.

1311
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:19,330
He had heard them and seen them, but had paid
them no attention, and he suddenly felt guilty.

1312
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:24,920
'If they had had another neighbour,' he thought,
'one who had noticed their suffering, perhaps

1313
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,590
they could have been rescued by now.'

1314
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:33,860
As Marius was thinking about the sad life
of the family in the next room, he stared

1315
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,489
dreamily at the wall that separated them.

1316
01:36:36,489 --> 01:36:40,070
Then, in the top corner near the ceiling,
Marius saw that there was a triangular hole.

1317
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:41,869
'Let's see what these people are really like,'
Marius thought.

1318
01:36:41,869 --> 01:36:47,320
'Then I'll be in a better position to help
them.'

1319
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:51,150
He stood on a cupboard, put his eye to the
hole, and looked through it into his neighbours'

1320
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:52,150
room.

1321
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:56,199
The Jondrettes' room was dirty and evil-smelling,
unlike Marius's bare but clean room.

1322
01:36:56,199 --> 01:36:59,579
Its only furniture was a chair, an old table,
some cracked dishes and two dirty beds, one

1323
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:02,100
on each side of a fireplace.

1324
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:07,189
A man with a long, grey beard was sitting
at the table, writing a letter and smoking

1325
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:08,189
a pipe.

1326
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:14,519
A large woman with greying hair, once red,
was sitting by the fire, while a thin, pale-faced

1327
01:37:14,519 --> 01:37:15,710
child sat on one of the beds.

1328
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:20,389
Marius, depressed at what he saw, was going
to get down from the cupboard when the door

1329
01:37:20,389 --> 01:37:21,439
of the Jondrettes' room opened and the elder
girl came in.

1330
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:24,929
Slamming the door shut behind her she cried
victoriously, 'He's coming!'

1331
01:37:24,929 --> 01:37:25,929
'Who's coming?'

1332
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:26,929
Her father looked up.

1333
01:37:26,929 --> 01:37:28,820
'The old man who goes to church.

1334
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:29,820
He's following me.

1335
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:34,349
I saw him with his daughter in the church,
and gave him the letter.

1336
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:36,030
He said he would follow me here.

1337
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:41,959
I ran ahead to tell you he'll be here in two
minutes.'

1338
01:37:41,959 --> 01:37:46,519
'You're a good girl,' the man said, rising
quickly to his feet.

1339
01:37:46,519 --> 01:37:48,719
Then, turning to his wife, he said, 'Quickly!

1340
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:49,809
Put out the fire!'

1341
01:37:49,809 --> 01:37:55,090
While she poured water on the flames, the
man broke the chair with his foot and told

1342
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,550
his younger daughter to break a window.

1343
01:37:56,550 --> 01:38:01,579
She put her fist through the glass and ran
to her bed, crying because her arm was covered

1344
01:38:01,579 --> 01:38:02,579
in blood.

1345
01:38:02,579 --> 01:38:12,539
'Excellent,' her father smiled, tearing a
piece off his shirt and using it as a bandage.

1346
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:14,929
'Now we're ready for the kind gentleman.

1347
01:38:14,929 --> 01:38:20,610
When he sees how miserable we are, he'll give
us a lot of money, you'll see.'

1348
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:24,420
Moments later, there was a gentle knock on
the door.

1349
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,769
Jondrette rushed to open it, bowing almost
to the ground as he did so.

1350
01:38:25,769 --> 01:38:26,769
'Please come in, my dear sir!

1351
01:38:26,769 --> 01:38:27,769
Please enter, with your charming young lady.'

1352
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:28,769
An elderly man and a young girl appeared in
the doorway and Marius, still looking through

1353
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:29,769
the hole in the wall, could not believe his
eyes.

1354
01:38:29,769 --> 01:38:30,769
It was She.

1355
01:38:30,769 --> 01:38:31,769
She!

1356
01:38:31,769 --> 01:38:32,769
Everyone who has ever loved will feel the
force of that small word.

1357
01:38:32,769 --> 01:38:33,769
In the bright mist that clouded his vision,
Marius could hardly see the features of the

1358
01:38:33,769 --> 01:38:34,769
sweet face that had lit his life for six months
and had then disappeared, filling his life

1359
01:38:34,769 --> 01:38:35,769
with darkness.

1360
01:38:35,769 --> 01:38:36,769
And now the vision had reappeared!

1361
01:38:36,769 --> 01:38:37,769
When Marius had recovered some of his senses,
he saw that she seemed a little paler than

1362
01:38:37,769 --> 01:38:38,769
before.

1363
01:38:38,769 --> 01:38:39,769
Her companion as usual was M. Leblanc.

1364
01:38:39,769 --> 01:38:40,769
As she entered the room, she put a large parcel
on the table.

1365
01:38:40,769 --> 01:38:41,769
'Monsieur, you will find some woollen stockings
and blankets in the parcel,' M. Leblanc told

1366
01:38:41,769 --> 01:38:42,769
Jondrette.

1367
01:38:42,769 --> 01:38:43,769
'You are extremely generous, Monsieur,' Jondrette
said, again bowing to the ground.

1368
01:38:43,769 --> 01:38:44,769
'But as you can see, we are unfortunate in
many ways.

1369
01:38:44,769 --> 01:38:45,769
We are without food, Monsieur, and without
heating.

1370
01:38:45,769 --> 01:38:46,769
No warmth for my unhappy children.

1371
01:38:46,769 --> 01:38:47,769
Our only chair is broken.

1372
01:38:47,769 --> 01:38:48,769
A broken window - in this weather!

1373
01:38:48,769 --> 01:38:49,769
My wife ill in bed and our younger daughter
injured.'

1374
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:50,769
'Oh, the poor child,' 'Ursula' said, seeing
the girl's bleeding wrist.

1375
01:38:50,769 --> 01:38:51,769
'She had an accident in the machine-shop where
she works for six sous an hour, 'Jondrette

1376
01:38:51,769 --> 01:38:52,769
explained.

1377
01:38:52,769 --> 01:38:53,769
'They may have to cut off her arm.'

1378
01:38:53,769 --> 01:38:54,769
The daughter, taking her father's words seriously,
began to scream with fear.

1379
01:38:54,769 --> 01:38:55,769
While M. Leblanc and 'Ursula' tried to comfort
her, Jondrette approached his wife and said

1380
01:38:55,769 --> 01:38:56,769
in a whisper, 'Take a good look at that man.'

1381
01:38:56,769 --> 01:38:57,769
He then returned to M. Leblanc and told him
about his debts.

1382
01:38:57,769 --> 01:38:58,769
'I owe sixty francs in rent,' he said.

1383
01:38:58,769 --> 01:38:59,769
M. Leblanc took a coin out of his pocket and
put it on the table.

1384
01:38:59,769 --> 01:39:00,769
'Five francs is all I have with me,' he said.

1385
01:39:00,769 --> 01:39:01,769
'But I'll take my daughter home and come back
this evening with more money for you.'

1386
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:02,769
Jondrette accompanied M. Leblanc and 'Ursula'
out of the door and, after a few minutes'

1387
01:39:02,769 --> 01:39:03,769
indecision, Marius jumped down from the cupboard
and ran out into the street.

1388
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:04,769
But he was too late; their carriage had already
gone.

1389
01:39:04,769 --> 01:39:05,769
Miserably, he turned back to the house.

1390
01:39:05,769 --> 01:39:06,769
He went into his room, pushing the door behind
him, but the door would not shut.

1391
01:39:06,769 --> 01:39:07,769
Turning, Marius saw that a hand was holding
it open.

1392
01:39:07,769 --> 01:39:08,769
'What is it?' he demanded.

1393
01:39:08,769 --> 01:39:09,769
It was the Jondrette girl.

1394
01:39:09,769 --> 01:39:10,769
'So it's you again,' he said almost fiercely.

1395
01:39:10,769 --> 01:39:11,769
'What do you want now?'

1396
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:12,769
She did not reply but stood thoughtfully looking
at him, seeming to have lost all her earlier

1397
01:39:12,769 --> 01:39:13,769
confidence.

1398
01:39:13,769 --> 01:39:14,769
She had not entered the room, but was still
standing in the half-light of the corridor.

1399
01:39:14,769 --> 01:39:15,769
'What do you want?'

1400
01:39:15,769 --> 01:39:16,769
Marius repeated angrily.

1401
01:39:16,769 --> 01:39:17,769
'M. Marius,' she said at last, a faint light
in her sad eyes, 'you seem upset.

1402
01:39:17,769 --> 01:39:18,769
What's the matter?'

1403
01:39:18,769 --> 01:39:19,769
'Nothing.

1404
01:39:19,769 --> 01:39:20,769
Now please leave me alone.'

1405
01:39:20,769 --> 01:39:21,769
Marius tried again to shut the door, but she
still held it open.

1406
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:22,769
'You're making a mistake,' she said.

1407
01:39:22,769 --> 01:39:23,769
'You aren't rich, but you were generous this
morning.

1408
01:39:23,769 --> 01:39:24,769
You've been kind to us - now I want to be
kind to you.

1409
01:39:24,769 --> 01:39:25,769
Is there anything that I can do?'

1410
01:39:25,769 --> 01:39:26,769
Marius considered her offer, then had an idea.

1411
01:39:26,769 --> 01:39:27,769
Moving closer to her, he said, 'Do you know
the address of those people who've just left

1412
01:39:27,769 --> 01:39:28,769
your room?'

1413
01:39:28,769 --> 01:39:29,769
'No.'

1414
01:39:29,769 --> 01:39:30,769
'Can you find out for me?'

1415
01:39:30,769 --> 01:39:31,769
'Is that what you want?'

1416
01:39:31,769 --> 01:39:32,769
she said, a disappointed look on her face.

1417
01:39:32,769 --> 01:39:33,769
'Yes.'

1418
01:39:33,769 --> 01:39:34,769
The girl looked hard at him for a minute.

1419
01:39:34,769 --> 01:39:35,769
'What will you give me?'

1420
01:39:35,769 --> 01:39:36,769
she said at last.

1421
01:39:36,769 --> 01:39:37,769
'Anything you want.'

1422
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:38,769
'Anything?'

1423
01:39:38,769 --> 01:39:39,769
'Yes.'

1424
01:39:39,769 --> 01:39:40,769
'Then I'll get it.'

1425
01:39:40,769 --> 01:39:41,769
She left immediately, closing the door behind
her.

1426
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:42,769
Marius sat down and buried his face in his
hands, too overcome by emotion to think clearly.

1427
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:43,769
But then he heard a loud voice from the next
room.

1428
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:44,769
'I tell you I'm sure.'

1429
01:39:44,769 --> 01:39:45,769
Jondrette was speaking to his wife.

1430
01:39:45,769 --> 01:39:46,769
'I recognized him.'

1431
01:39:46,769 --> 01:39:47,769
Without another thought, Marius jumped on
to the cupboard and looked again through the

1432
01:39:47,769 --> 01:39:49,070
hole in the wall.

1433
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:50,710
'Really?'

1434
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:51,790
His wife looked puzzled.

1435
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:53,130
'Are you sure?'

1436
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:55,050
'Of course I'm sure.

1437
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:59,579
It's been eight years, but I recognized him
at once.'

1438
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:05,219
He told the two girls to leave the room and
then, when alone with his wife, he said, 'And

1439
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:07,090
I recognized the girl too.

1440
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:09,539
I'm surprised you didn't.'

1441
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:11,389
'Why should I?

1442
01:40:11,389 --> 01:40:13,840
I've never seen her'

1443
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,210
But Jondrette bent down and whispered something
in her ear.

1444
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:22,820
Straightening up, he said, 'Now do you recognize
her?'

1445
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:27,959
'Her?' said the woman, her voice filled with
sudden hatred.

1446
01:40:27,959 --> 01:40:29,519
'Are you sure?

1447
01:40:29,519 --> 01:40:30,570
That's impossible!'

1448
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:31,570
she cried.

1449
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:35,530
'Our daughters barefoot and without a dress
between them, while she wears leather boots

1450
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:36,530
and a fur coat?

1451
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:37,530
You must be wrong.

1452
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,530
You've forgotten, that child was ugly, and
this one's not bad-looking.'

1453
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:39,530
'I tell you, it's the same girl.

1454
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:40,530
You'll see.

1455
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:41,530
And I'll tell you another thing.

1456
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,530
She's going to make us a fortune.

1457
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:43,530
I'm tired of being poor.

1458
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:44,530
We deserve a better life, and this is our
chance.'

1459
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,530
'What do you mean?'

1460
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,530
'He said he'll be here at six o'clock, with
sixty francs.

1461
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:47,530
I'll bring some friends round, and we'll make
sure he gives us a lot more money.'

1462
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:48,530
'What will you do if he doesn't give you more
money?'

1463
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:49,530
Jondrette stroked his beard and laughed.

1464
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:50,530
'We'll know what to do about it.'

1465
01:40:50,530 --> 01:40:51,530
And then, as he was going to leave the room,
he turned to his wife and said, 'You know,

1466
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:52,530
it's lucky he didn't recognize me.

1467
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,530
If he had, he wouldn't be coming back here
again.

1468
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,530
It's the beard that saved me - my lovely,
long, romantic beard!'

1469
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:55,530
With an ugly laugh, he pulled his cap down
over his eyes and left the room.

1470
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:56,530
***

1471
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,530
Although Marius was a dreamer and not a man
of action, he knew immediately that he had

1472
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:58,530
to save M. Leblanc and 'Ursula' from the trap
that Jondrette was setting for them.

1473
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:59,530
But what could he do?

1474
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:00,530
He could not warn M. Leblanc because he did
not know the old man's address.

1475
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:01,530
There was only one thing to do: he had to
tell the police.

1476
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,530
Half an hour later, Marius was at the nearest
police station.

1477
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:03,530
The desk clerk showed him into the police
chief's office, where a tall man with a wide

1478
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:04,530
face and a thin, tight mouth was trying to
keep warm next to a tire.

1479
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:05,530
'Are you the chief of police?'

1480
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:06,530
Marius asked.

1481
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:07,530
'He's away,' the tall man said.

1482
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:08,530
'I'm Inspector Javert.

1483
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,530
Now, what do you want?'

1484
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:10,530
Marius told Javert about the morning's events.

1485
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,530
When he told Javert his address, he noticed
the inspector's eyes light up with great interest.

1486
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,530
Then, when everything had been explained,
Javert thought for a moment.

1487
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:13,530
Finally, he asked Marius for his door key
and told him to go home and hide quietly in

1488
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,530
his room so that his neighbours would think
he was out.

1489
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,530
'Take these with you,' the inspector went
on, producing two small guns.

1490
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,530
'When the old man and the girl arrive, let
them start their business.

1491
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:17,530
When you think it's getting dangerous, shoot
one of these guns.

1492
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:18,530
After that, I'll take charge.'

1493
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:19,530
Back in his room, Marius sat down nervously
on his bed.

1494
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:20,530
It was nearly six o'clock.

1495
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:21,530
Outside it had stopped snowing, and a full
moon was growing steadily brighter above the

1496
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:22,530
mist.

1497
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:23,530
Suddenly, he heard voices.

1498
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:24,530
Taking off his boots, he quietly climbed on
to the cupboard and looked through the hole

1499
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:25,530
in the wall.

1500
01:41:25,530 --> 01:41:26,530
A fire burned in the corner of the room, filling
it with blood-red light.

1501
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:27,530
Jondrette, who had just come in, was shaking
snow from his shoes.

1502
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:28,530
'Everything's arranged,' he said.

1503
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:29,530
'Has the concierge gone out?'

1504
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:30,530
'Yes,' his wife said.

1505
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:31,530
'And you're sure he's not in next door?'

1506
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,530
'Positive.'

1507
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:33,530
'Good.'

1508
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:34,530
Then he turned to his daughters.

1509
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:35,530
'Now, you two must go and keep guard in the
street, one by the gate, one at the street

1510
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:36,530
corner.'

1511
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:37,530
'A fine job!'

1512
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,530
the elder girl called back.

1513
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:39,530
'Keeping guard barefoot in the snow.'

1514
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:40,530
'Tomorrow you'll have fur boots!'

1515
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:41,530
her father called out after her.

1516
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:42,530
A few minutes later, there was nobody in the
building except for Marius and the Jondrettes.

1517
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:43,530
Marius watched as Jondrette put a metal bar
in the fire and inspected a rope ladder on

1518
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:44,530
the table.

1519
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:45,530
Next, he opened a drawer, took out a long
knife and tested its blade with his finger.

1520
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:46,530
Suddenly, at exactly six o'clock, the door
into the Jondrettes' room opened.

1521
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:47,530
'Welcome, Monsieur, 'Jondrette said, rising
to his feet.

1522
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:48,530
M. Leblanc appeared and put four coins on
the table.

1523
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:49,530
'That is for your rent and food, Monsieur,'
he said.

1524
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:50,530
'Now we must discuss what else is needed.'

1525
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:51,530
Jondrette quietly told his wife to dismiss
the carriage, and when she had left the room,

1526
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:52,530
turned back to his visitor.

1527
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:53,530
'How is the wounded child?'

1528
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:54,530
M. Leblanc asked him.

1529
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:55,530
'Not well.'

1530
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:56,530
Jondrette smiled sadly.

1531
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:57,530
'She's in great pain.

1532
01:41:57,530 --> 01:41:58,530
Her sister has taken her to hospital, but
they'll be back soon.'

1533
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,530
The conversation continued politely in this
way for several minutes.

1534
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,530
M. Leblanc asked Jondrette about his circumstances,
and Jondrette smiled sadly as he invented

1535
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:01,530
lie after lie.

1536
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:02,530
Finally, Jondrette picked up a large picture
that was leaning against the wall, and showed

1537
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:03,530
it to M. Leblanc.

1538
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:04,530
'What's that?'

1539
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:05,530
M. Leblanc said, looking at the badly-drawn
picture of a soldier in uniform.

1540
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:06,530
'It's a work of art,' Jondrette informed him.

1541
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:07,530
'I love this picture as much as I love my
two daughters.

1542
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:08,530
But, unfortunately, I have to sell it.

1543
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,530
What do you think it's worth?'

1544
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:10,530
'It's just an old inn-sign.

1545
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:11,530
It's worth about three francs.'

1546
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:12,530
'I'll accept a thousand,' Jondrette softly
replied.

1547
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:13,530
M. Leblanc rose and, standing with his back
to the wall, looked quickly round the room.

1548
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,530
Jondrette was on his left, his wife was standing
on his right near the door.

1549
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:15,530
Jondrette put the picture down and stepped
quietly towards the old man.

1550
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:16,530
'You don't recognize me, do you?' he said
in a loud, clear voice.

1551
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:17,530
At this signal, which he had pre-arranged
with his friends, three men armed with metal

1552
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:18,530
poles rushed into the room.

1553
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:19,530
M. Leblanc grew pale, and gripped the back
of the broken chair with his huge hands.

1554
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:20,530
Marius, meanwhile, raised his right hand with
the gun, ready to fire the warning shot.

1555
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,530
'The carriage is ready?'

1556
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:22,530
Jondrette asked the three men.

1557
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:23,530
'Yes, with two good horses,' one of them replied.

1558
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:24,530
'Excellent.'

1559
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,530
He turned to M. Leblanc and repeated his earlier
question.

1560
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:26,530
'You still don't recognize me, do you?'

1561
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,530
'No.'

1562
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:28,530
'My name isn't Jondrette.

1563
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,530
It's Thenardier.

1564
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:30,530
Now do you recognize me?'

1565
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:31,530
M. Leblanc trembled slightly, but still shook
his head.

1566
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:32,530
Marius, however, who had been going to fire
the gun as a signal for the police to arrive,

1567
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,530
shook so much that he almost fell off the
cupboard.

1568
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:34,530
'Thenardier,' he thought.

1569
01:42:34,530 --> 01:42:35,530
'That's the name of the man who saved my father's
life at the Battle of Waterloo.

1570
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,530
The man I've promised to help!'

1571
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:37,530
If he fired the warning shot, M. Leblanc would
be saved and Thenardier would be destroyed.

1572
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:38,530
But he would also have broken his promise
to his father.

1573
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:39,530
He felt his knees grow weak.

1574
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:40,530
What should he do?

1575
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:41,530
Thenardier walked up and down in front of
M. Leblanc.

1576
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,530
'Do you remember the little inn in Montfermeil
eight years ago?

1577
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:43,530
You took away our Cosette, do you remember?

1578
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:44,530
Wearing that old yellow coat, pretending you
were a tramp!

1579
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:45,530
Well, now you're going to learn that you can't
make things right by just bringing a few hospital

1580
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,530
blankets!

1581
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:47,530
You're the cause of all my troubles.

1582
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,530
For 1500 francs you took away a girl who was
bringing me lots of money.'

1583
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:49,530
'I don't know what you're talking about,'
M. Leblanc said.

1584
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,530
'I don't know who you are, but I know what
you are.

1585
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,530
You're a dirty criminal.'

1586
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:52,530
'A criminal?'

1587
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:53,530
Thenardier said, suddenly angry.

1588
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:54,530
'That's what you rich people call people like
me, isn't it?

1589
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:55,530
Just because I've failed in business.

1590
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:56,530
I was a war hero, you know - I saved an officer's
life at Waterloo!

1591
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:57,530
And you call me a criminal!

1592
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,530
Well, I'm going to teach you a lesson.'

1593
01:42:58,530 --> 01:42:59,530
He began to move towards M. Leblanc, but the
old man was too quick for him.

1594
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:00,530
With surprising speed, he pushed the table
and chair to one side and ran to the window.

1595
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:01,530
He managed to open it but, before he could
jump, the three men jumped on him and held

1596
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:02,530
him to the floor.

1597
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:03,530
This was too much for Marius.

1598
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:04,530
'Forgive me, father,' he murmured, preparing
to fire the gun.

1599
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:05,530
But suddenly Thenardier cried, 'Don't hurt
him!'

1600
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:06,530
After a long fight, M. Leblanc was tied up
and taken to the bed.

1601
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:07,530
'No wallet?'

1602
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,530
Thenardier cried, having searched his pockets.

1603
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,530
'Never mind.'

1604
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:10,530
He sat on the bed next to the helpless but
brave old man, and said, 'Let's discuss things

1605
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:11,530
quietly.

1606
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:12,530
All I'm asking for is 200,000 francs.

1607
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:13,530
I realize that you don't have the money with
you now, but I want you to write a letter.

1608
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:14,530
I'll tell you what to say.'

1609
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:15,530
He untied M. Leblanc's right hand and, producing
a pen and paper, began:

1610
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:16,530
My dearest daughter, You must come at once.

1611
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,530
I need you urgently.

1612
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:18,530
The person who gives you this note will bring
you to me.

1613
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,530
I shall be waiting.

1614
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:20,530
M. Leblanc signed his name Urbain Fabre, which
seemed to satisfy Thenardier, and wrote an

1615
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,530
address on the envelope.

1616
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:22,530
Thenardier then took the letter and gave it
to his wife.

1617
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,530
'There's a carriage outside.

1618
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,530
Don't be long.'

1619
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:25,530
Nearly half an hour passed.

1620
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:26,530
Thenardier seemed lost in his own dark thoughts.

1621
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:27,530
The prisoner did not move.

1622
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:28,530
Finally, there was the sound of horses in
the street outside and, moments later, the

1623
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,530
door to the room was thrown open.

1624
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,530
'It's a false address,' Mme Thenardier cried.

1625
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:31,530
'There's no Urbain Fabre.

1626
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:32,530
The old man's been lying to us!'

1627
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,530
Thenardier sat on the corner of the table
in silence for some moments, swinging his

1628
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,530
leg and gazing with a fierce satisfaction
at the fire.

1629
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:35,530
Then he turned to the prisoner and said in
a slow, threatening voice, 'What did you hope

1630
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:36,530
to gain by giving me a false name and address?'

1631
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,530
'Time!'

1632
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:38,530
cried the prisoner in a loud voice, jumping
from the bed, having secretly cut the ropes

1633
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:39,530
that tied him.

1634
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:40,530
Before the others in the room could react,
M. Leblanc was standing by the fire, holding

1635
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,530
a metal bar above his head.

1636
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,530
'I'm not afraid of you,' he said.

1637
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:43,530
'But neither should you fear me.'

1638
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:44,530
With those words he threw the metal bar out
of the window into the street below.

1639
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:45,530
'Get him!'

1640
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:46,530
Thenardier shouted.

1641
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:47,530
'He's defenceless.'

1642
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,530
Two men grabbed him by the shoulders.

1643
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:49,530
'Now cut his throat!'

1644
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:50,530
Thenardier called.

1645
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:51,530
Marius stared, frozen with fear as Thenardier,
knife in hand, stood hesitating a few steps

1646
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,530
away from the prisoner.

1647
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:53,530
The brave man was in terrible danger, but
Marius still could not fire the gun.

1648
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:54,530
Then, in the moonlight, he saw the solution
to his problem.

1649
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:55,530
On top of the cupboard, by his feet, he noticed
the piece of paper that the elder daughter

1650
01:43:55,530 --> 01:43:56,530
had written on: Be careful!

1651
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:57,530
The police are coming!

1652
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,530
He immediately saw what he had to do.

1653
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:59,530
He took a piece of brick from the wall, wrapped
the piece of paper around it and threw it

1654
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:00,530
through the hole into the middle of Thenardier's
room.

1655
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:01,530
He was just in time.

1656
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:02,530
Thenardier was advancing towards his prisoner,
knife in hand, when his wife cried, 'Something

1657
01:44:02,530 --> 01:44:03,530
fell!'

1658
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:04,530
She picked up the piece of paper and handed
it to her husband, who read it quickly.

1659
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:05,530
'It's Eponine's handwriting!' he cried a moment
later.

1660
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:06,530
'Quick!

1661
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:07,530
Get the ladder.

1662
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:08,530
The police are coming and we've got to go!'

1663
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:09,530
They threw the rope ladder from the open window
but, before they could escape, the door opened

1664
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:10,530
and Inspector Javert walked in.

1665
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:11,530
'Relax,' he smiled.

1666
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,530
'You can't escape through the window.

1667
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,530
There are five of you, and fifteen of us.

1668
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:14,530
You have no chance.

1669
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:15,530
Why not come quietly?'

1670
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:16,530
The men put down their weapons and surrendered
without a fight.

1671
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:17,530
When everybody had been arrested and taken
from the room, Javert noticed the prisoner,

1672
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:18,530
who was standing, head bowed, by the window.

1673
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:19,530
He turned to speak to another policeman but,
when he looked back, he saw that the prisoner

1674
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:20,530
had gone.

1675
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:21,530
Javert rushed to the open window and looked
down.

1676
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:22,530
The rope ladder was swinging gently above
the empty street.

1677
01:44:22,530 --> 01:44:23,530
'He must have been the cleverest of them all,
'Javert murmured angrily to himself.

1678
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:24,530
CHAPTER EIGHT
Marius and Cosette

1679
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,530
Not wishing to give evidence against Thenardier
in court, Marius made immediate arrangements

1680
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:26,530
to leave his room.

1681
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:27,530
Early the following morning, he paid the concierge
his final rent and went to live with his friend,

1682
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:28,530
Enjolras.

1683
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:29,530
Inspector Javert looked for Marius everywhere,
but without success.

1684
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:30,530
Two months later, Marius was deeply unhappy.

1685
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:31,530
He sent money every Monday to Thenardier,
who was in prison, which meant that he had

1686
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:32,530
even less money for himself.

1687
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:33,530
But the main reason for his unhappiness was
that he was forced to live his life with no

1688
01:44:33,530 --> 01:44:34,530
hope of seeing 'Ursula'.

1689
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:35,530
One afternoon he was sitting in a field, looking
down at a small river, when his dreams of

1690
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:36,530
'Ursula' were suddenly broken by the sound
of a familiar voice.

1691
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:37,530
He looked up and recognized Eponine, Thenardiers
elder daughter.

1692
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:38,530
Still wearing the same rags, with the same
bold look in her eyes and the same rough voice,

1693
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:39,530
she had somehow become more beautiful.

1694
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:40,530
She stared at Marius with a look of pleasure
on her pale face, and for some moments seemed

1695
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:41,530
unable to speak.

1696
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:42,530
'So at last I've found you,' she finally said.

1697
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:43,530
'I've been looking for you everywhere.

1698
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:44,530
You aren't living in the same room any more?'

1699
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:45,530
'No,' said Marius.

1700
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:46,530
'Well, I can understand that.

1701
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:47,530
It's not nice, that sort of thing.

1702
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:48,530
But why are you wearing that dirty old hat?

1703
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,530
'When Marius gave no answer, she went on,
'And you've got a hole in your shirt.

1704
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:50,530
I'll mend it for you.

1705
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:51,530
A young man like you ought to be nicely dressed.'

1706
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:52,530
Marius still said nothing, and after a moments
pause she said, 'You don't seem very glad

1707
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:53,530
to see me, but I could make you look happy
if I wanted to!'

1708
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:54,530
'How?' said Marius.

1709
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:55,530
'What do you mean?'

1710
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:56,530
'You weren't so unfriendly last time.'

1711
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:57,530
'I'm sorry, but what do you mean?'

1712
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:58,530
She bit her lip and hesitated, as if trying
to make up her mind about something.

1713
01:44:58,530 --> 01:44:59,530
Finally, she said, 'I've got the address.'

1714
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:00,530
Marius's heart seemed to miss a beat.

1715
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:01,530
'You mean

1716
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:02,530
'The address you wanted me to find out.

1717
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,530
The young lady, you know...'

1718
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,530
Her voice sank into a sigh.

1719
01:45:04,530 --> 01:45:05,530
Marius jumped up and took her by the hand.

1720
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:06,530
'Let's go at once!' he cried, wild with excitement.

1721
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:07,530
Then he suddenly frowned and seized Eponine
by the arm.

1722
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:08,530
'But you must promise me,' he said, 'that
you'll never tell your father the address.'

1723
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:09,530
'I promise,' the girl replied, staring at
Marius with amusement.

1724
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,530
They had only gone a few steps when Eponine
stopped and said, 'You remember you promised

1725
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:11,530
me something?'

1726
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:12,530
Marius felt in his pocket.

1727
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:13,530
All he had in the world was the five-franc
piece he intended to give her father in prison.

1728
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:14,530
He pushed it into her hand, but she opened
her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground.

1729
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:15,530
She looked at him with a mixture of disappointment
and sadness in her eyes.

1730
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:16,530
'I don't want your money,' she said.

1731
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:17,530
***

1732
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:18,530
That evening, Cosette was alone in the house
which Jean Valjean had bought about a year

1733
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:19,530
earlier.

1734
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:20,530
It was a small house in a back street, with
a large, wild garden.

1735
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:21,530
Valjean had gone away on business for a couple
of days, and Cosette was in the downstairs

1736
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,530
sitting room, playing the piano.

1737
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:23,530
Suddenly, she thought she heard the sound
of footsteps in the garden.

1738
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:24,530
She listened at the window for a minute, then
ran up to her bedroom, opened the window and

1739
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:25,530
looked out.

1740
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:26,530
The moonlit garden and the street beyond it
were completely empty.

1741
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:27,530
Cosette, not a nervous girl by nature, smiled
to herself and thought no more about it.

1742
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,530
The next evening, as she was walking in the
garden, she was sure that she heard someone

1743
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,530
moving in the trees.

1744
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:30,530
Again, when she looked round, she saw nothing.

1745
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:31,530
When Jean Valjean returned from his business
the following day, Cosette told him about

1746
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:32,530
the noises in the garden.

1747
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:33,530
He told her not to worry, but she noticed
an anxious look in his eyes.

1748
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:34,530
He spent the next two nights walking around
the garden, checking the gate, listening for

1749
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:35,530
noises, but nothing unusual happened.

1750
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:36,530
Then one morning, a few days later, Cosette
noticed a large stone lying on the garden

1751
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:37,530
bench.

1752
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:38,530
Nervously, she picked it up and discovered
an envelope underneath it.

1753
01:45:38,530 --> 01:45:39,530
Inside, there was a small notebook filled
with love poems.

1754
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:40,530
Cosette sat down and began to read, enjoying
the music of the language and the beauty of

1755
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:41,530
the handwriting.

1756
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:42,530
She had never read anything like this before,
and it affected her deeply.

1757
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:43,530
Her heart on fire, she took the notebook upstairs
to her bedroom and read every word again.

1758
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:44,530
She remembered the handsome young man she
had seen so often in the Luxembourg Gardens.

1759
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:45,530
As she read the notebook, she knew in her
heart that he was the author of these beautiful,

1760
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:46,530
romantic words.

1761
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:47,530
Finally, she kissed the book, held it to her
heart and waited for the evening, when she

1762
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:48,530
knew that something special was going to occur.

1763
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,530
That evening, Jean Valjean went out.

1764
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:50,530
Cosette spent a long time in front of the
mirror, making her hair look beautiful and

1765
01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:51,530
deciding which dress to wear.

1766
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,530
Finally, she went out into the garden.

1767
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:53,530
She sat on the bench where she had found the
notebook and, moments later, had the strange

1768
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:54,530
feeling that she was being watched.

1769
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,530
She looked round and jumped to her feet.

1770
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:56,530
It was He!

1771
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:57,530
He looked paler and thinner than she remembered.

1772
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:58,530
His dark clothes were almost invisible in
the shadows, and his face shone softly in

1773
01:45:58,530 --> 01:45:59,530
the fading light.

1774
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:00,530
Cosette felt suddenly faint, but she did not
move or make a sound.

1775
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:01,530
'Forgive me for being here.'

1776
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:02,530
Marius spoke at last.

1777
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:03,530
'But I've been so unhappy.

1778
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:04,530
Do you recognize me?

1779
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:05,530
You mustn't be afraid.

1780
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:06,530
It's a long time ago, but do you remember
the day when you first looked at me - in the

1781
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:07,530
Luxembourg Gardens?

1782
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:08,530
And the day you walked past me?

1783
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:09,530
Those things happened nearly a year ago.

1784
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:10,530
Forgive me for talking like this, I don't
know what I'm saying - perhaps I'm annoying

1785
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,530
you?

1786
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:12,530
But the truth is, I can't live without you.'

1787
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,530
'Mother!'

1788
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:14,530
Cosette murmured, and began to fall.

1789
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:15,530
Marius caught her and held her tightly in
his arms without realizing what he was doing,

1790
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:16,530
lost in a mist of love.

1791
01:46:16,530 --> 01:46:17,530
Cosette, feeling her body close to his, took
his hand and pressed it against her heart.

1792
01:46:17,530 --> 01:46:18,530
Aware of the shape of the notebook under her
dress, he said, 'So, you've read my notebook.

1793
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:19,530
Do you love me, too?'

1794
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:20,530
'Of course,' she answered in a low voice.

1795
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:21,530
'You know I do.'

1796
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,530
Then, as if by magic, her lips were next to
his and they were kissing.

1797
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:23,530
Afterwards, they sat together on the garden
bench in a state of shock, neither of them

1798
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:24,530
speaking.

1799
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:25,530
Beneath the stars, they were happy just to
look into each others eyes and hold each other's

1800
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:26,530
hands.

1801
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:27,530
Then, at last, they began to speak.

1802
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:28,530
They talked all evening about their dreams,
their mistakes, their moments of happiness,

1803
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:29,530
their moments of despair.

1804
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:30,530
When everything had been said, she laid her
head on his shoulder and asked, 'What's your

1805
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:31,530
name?'

1806
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:32,530
'My name's Marius.

1807
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:33,530
And yours?'

1808
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:34,530
'Cosette.'

1809
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:35,530
During that month of May in the year 1832,
Cosette and Marius met every day in the wild

1810
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:36,530
garden of that small, secret house.

1811
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,530
They would sit and hold hands and talk, or
just gaze into each other's eyes and smile.

1812
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:38,530
'How lovely you are,' Marius would sigh.

1813
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:39,530
'There are moments when I think this is a
dream.

1814
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:40,530
There are other moments when I think I'm a
little mad.

1815
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,530
I love you so much.'

1816
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:42,530
To which Cosette would reply, 'I love you
more with every minute that passes.'

1817
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:43,530
In this way, bathed in happiness, they lived
untroubled by the world.

1818
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:44,530
***

1819
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:45,530
One beautiful, starry evening, Marius found
Cosette sitting unhappily in her garden.

1820
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:46,530
'What's the matter?' he asked, sitting next
to her on the bench.

1821
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:47,530
'My father said that we may have to leave,'
she replied.

1822
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:48,530
Marius trembled.

1823
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:49,530
For six weeks, he had known nothing but uncomplicated
happiness.

1824
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:50,530
Now, for the first time, there was a cloud
in the clear blue sky of his life.

1825
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:51,530
He could not speak, and Cosette felt his hand
grow cold.

1826
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:52,530
She asked, as he had done, 'What's the matter?'

1827
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:53,530
He replied, in a voice so low that she could
hardly hear it, 'I don't understand what you

1828
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,530
mean.'

1829
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:55,530
'Father told me this morning that I have to
pack everything and be ready to leave for

1830
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:56,530
England within a week.'

1831
01:46:56,530 --> 01:46:57,530
Marius rose to his feet and said coldly, 'Cosette,
are you going?'

1832
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:58,530
She looked up at him, her pale face lined
with misery.

1833
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:59,530
'What else can I do?'

1834
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:00,530
she cried.

1835
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:01,530
'So you're leaving me.'

1836
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:02,530
'Oh, Marius, why are you being so cruel to
me?'

1837
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:03,530
Marius turned his back to her and said, 'Then
I shall have to go away.'

1838
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:04,530
'No, Marius, wait.

1839
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:05,530
I've got an idea.'

1840
01:47:05,530 --> 01:47:06,530
Marius turned and was surprised to see her
smiling.

1841
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,530
'What is it?'

1842
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:08,530
'If we go, you must come too.

1843
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:09,530
I'll tell you where, and you must meet me
there, wherever it is.'

1844
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:10,530
'How can I possibly do that?' he cried.

1845
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:11,530
'Are you crazy?

1846
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:12,530
You need money to go to England, and I haven't
got any.

1847
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:13,530
I haven't told you, Cosette, but I'm a poor
man.

1848
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:14,530
I wear a cheap hat, my jacket has lost half
its buttons and there are holes in my boots.'

1849
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:15,530
He turned away from her and stood with his
face pressed to the trunk of a tree, almost

1850
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:16,530
ready to faint.

1851
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,530
He stayed in that position for some time.

1852
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:18,530
Finally, he heard a small sound behind him
and, turning round, he saw that Cosette was

1853
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:19,530
in tears.

1854
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:20,530
He fell on his knees in front of her and pressed
her hand to his lips.

1855
01:47:20,530 --> 01:47:21,530
'Don't cry,' he said.

1856
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:22,530
'I cannot let you leave me.

1857
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:23,530
I promise you that if you leave me, I shall
die.

1858
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,530
But listen to me - I have a plan.

1859
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:25,530
Don't expect me here tomorrow.'

1860
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:26,530
'Why not?'

1861
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:27,530
Cosette said, drying her tears.

1862
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:28,530
'A whole day without seeing you!

1863
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:29,530
That's unbearable!'

1864
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:30,530
'It's worth losing a day together if we want
to be happy for the rest of our lives.'

1865
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:31,530
'But what are you going to do?'

1866
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,530
'Wait until the day after tomorrow.

1867
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:33,530
I'll tell you then.

1868
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:34,530
But until then, I must give you my address.

1869
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:35,530
I'm living with a friend of mine, Enjolras.'

1870
01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:36,530
Marius then took a knife out of his pocket
and scratched his address on the wall - 16,

1871
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:37,530
rue de la Verrerie.'

1872
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:38,530
'Please, Marius,' Cosette said as she watched
him.

1873
01:47:38,530 --> 01:47:39,530
'Where are you going tomorrow evening?

1874
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:40,530
I won't be able to sleep if you don't tell
me.'

1875
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:41,530
'I'm going to try something.'

1876
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:42,530
'Well, I'll pray for you to succeed and I'll
never stop thinking about you.

1877
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:43,530
I'll ask no more questions, but you must promise
to be here early the day after tomorrow.

1878
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:44,530
Not later than nine o'clock.'

1879
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:45,530
'I promise,' Marius said.

1880
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:46,530
CHAPTER NINE
Monsieur Gillenormand

1881
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:47,530
M. Gillenormand, Marius's grandfather, was
now ninety years old.

1882
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:48,530
He was unhappy about many things - about losing
his teeth, about the political situation but,

1883
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:49,530
most of all, about the fact that he had not
seen his grandson for four years, since their

1884
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:50,530
big quarrel.

1885
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:51,530
Although he was too proud to admit he was
wrong, and although he was angry, M. Gillenormand

1886
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:52,530
hoped that Marius, whom he still loved, would
return one day.

1887
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:53,530
One evening in June, M. Gillenormand was sitting
in front of a large fire, staring into the

1888
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:54,530
flames and thinking bitterly of Marius.

1889
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:55,530
He was feeling depressed, because he realized
that he would probably never see his grandson

1890
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:56,530
again.

1891
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:57,530
While he was gazing into the fire, thinking
these sad thoughts, his old servant entered

1892
01:47:57,530 --> 01:47:58,530
the room and asked, 'Will Monsieur receive
M. Marius?'

1893
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:59,530
For a moment all the blood seemed to leave
M. Gillenormand's face, and the servant began

1894
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:00,530
to worry that his master was ill.

1895
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:01,530
But the old man finally raised his head and
said, in a low voice, 'Show him in.'

1896
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:02,530
Marius stood uncertainly in the doorway.

1897
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:03,530
The poor condition of his clothes could not
be seen in the half-darkness of the room.

1898
01:48:03,530 --> 01:48:04,530
Nothing of him was clearly visible except
his face, which was calm and serious, but

1899
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:05,530
strangely sad.

1900
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:06,530
M. Gillenormand stared at his grandson with
disbelief.

1901
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:07,530
At last!

1902
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,530
After four years!

1903
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:09,530
Was it really him?

1904
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:10,530
He wanted to open his arms and hug him, but
all he said was, 'What have you come for?'

1905
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,530
Marius murmured something in embarrassment.

1906
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:12,530
'I can't hear you,' the old man said, looking
annoyed.

1907
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:13,530
'Have you come to apologize?

1908
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,530
Do you now see that you were wrong?'

1909
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:15,530
'No, Monsieur.'

1910
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:16,530
Marius lowered his eyes.

1911
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:17,530
'Well then,' the old man shouted, 'what do
you want?'

1912
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:18,530
'Monsieur, I ask you to have pity on me.

1913
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:19,530
I know I'm not welcome here, but I have come
to ask for only one thing.

1914
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:20,530
Then I'll go away at once.'

1915
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:21,530
'You're a young fool,' the old man said.

1916
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:22,530
'Who said you had to go away?

1917
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:23,530
You left me - your grandfather!

1918
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:24,530
- to join in those street protests against
the government, I suppose.

1919
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:25,530
You're probably in trouble with the police,
or you're in debt, and you've run back to

1920
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:26,530
me for help

1921
01:48:26,530 --> 01:48:27,530
'Monsieur, it's none of those things.'

1922
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:28,530
'Well, what is it exactly that you want?'

1923
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:29,530
'I have come to ask your permission to get
married.'

1924
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:30,530
The old man paused for a moment before saying,
'So, you want to get married at the age of

1925
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:31,530
twenty-one.

1926
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:32,530
I suppose you've got some sort of career,
now?

1927
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:33,530
Perhaps you've made a fortune.

1928
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:34,530
What do you earn as a lawyer?'

1929
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:35,530
'Nothing.'

1930
01:48:35,530 --> 01:48:36,530
'Well then, I imagine the lucky girl must
have money.'

1931
01:48:36,530 --> 01:48:37,530
'She's no richer than I am.'

1932
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:38,530
'What does her father do?'

1933
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:39,530
'I don't know.'

1934
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:40,530
M. Gillenormand turned away with disgust.

1935
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:41,530
'So that's it.

1936
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:42,530
Twenty-one years old, no job, no money.

1937
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:43,530
Your wife will have to count the sous when
she goes to the market, won't she?'

1938
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:44,530
'I beg you, Monsieur,' Marius cried.

1939
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:45,530
'I love her so much.

1940
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:46,530
Please allow me to marry her!'

1941
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:47,530
The old man gave a high, unpleasant laugh.

1942
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:48,530
'So you said to yourself, "I'll have to go
and see him, that old fool.

1943
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:49,530
He'll be so happy to see me that he won't
care who I marry.

1944
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:50,530
I haven't a pair of shoes, and she hasn't
a shirt, but never mind.

1945
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:51,530
I'm going to throw away my youth, my career,
my whole life, and dive into poverty with

1946
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:52,530
a woman around my neck...

1947
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:53,530
" That's what you think, isn't it?

1948
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:54,530
Well, my boy, you can do whatever you want.

1949
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:55,530
But I will never give you my permission!

1950
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:56,530
Never!'

1951
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,530
'Grandfather

1952
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:58,530
'Never!'

1953
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,530
The tone of his grandfather's voice robbed
Marius of all hope.

1954
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:00,530
He rose and crossed the room slowly, with
his head bowed.

1955
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:01,530
He had just reached the door, however, when
M. Gillenormand moved quickly towards him,

1956
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:02,530
pulled him back into the room and pushed him
into an armchair.

1957
01:49:02,530 --> 01:49:03,530
'Tell me about it,' he said to Marius, who
stared back with silent amazement, unaware

1958
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:04,530
that the word 'grandfather' was responsible
for the change in the old man's behaviour.

1959
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:05,530
'Come on, tell me about your love affairs.

1960
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:06,530
Don't be afraid to talk.

1961
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:07,530
Don't forget, I'm your grandfather.

1962
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:08,530
Here... ' he said, taking a purse from a drawer
and putting it on the table.

1963
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:09,530
'Here's some money for you.

1964
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,530
Buy yourself some new clothes.'

1965
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,530
Marius told his grandfather all about Cosette
and how much he loved her.

1966
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:12,530
M. Gillenormand listened carefully and, when
Marius had finished, he laughed.

1967
01:49:12,530 --> 01:49:13,530
'You must enjoy yourself when you're young,'
he said.

1968
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:14,530
'But you must also be sensible.

1969
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:15,530
Don't get married yet, that's my advice.

1970
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,530
Have fun with the girl, but don't marry her.

1971
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:17,530
Make her your lover but not your wife.'

1972
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:18,530
Marius, too shocked to reply, shook his head
and rose to his feet.

1973
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:19,530
He then turned slowly to the old man, bowed
deeply and said, 'Four years ago you insulted

1974
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:20,530
my father.

1975
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:21,530
Today you have insulted my future wife.

1976
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:22,530
I shall ask no more favours of you, Monsieur.

1977
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:23,530
Goodbye.'

1978
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:24,530
M. Gillenormand called for Marius to come
back, but it was too late.

1979
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:25,530
The proud young man had closed the door and
gone.

1980
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:26,530
'Oh my God,' the old man cried, burying his
face in his hands.

1981
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:27,530
'What have I done?

1982
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:28,530
This time he'll never come back.'

1983
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,530
***

1984
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:30,530
Marius left his grandfathers house in a state
of despair, and returning to his room, fell

1985
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:31,530
asleep fully-dressed on the bed.

1986
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:32,530
When he woke up, Enjolras was in the room
with a few other friends.

1987
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,530
They all looked very nervous and excited about
something.

1988
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:34,530
'What's the matter?'

1989
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,530
Marius asked sleepily

1990
01:49:35,530 --> 01:49:36,530
'Are you coming to the funeral of General
Lamarque?'

1991
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:37,530
'Who's he?'

1992
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,530
Enjolras and his friends shook their heads
with amazement at their friend's lack of awareness,

1993
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,530
and soon left the room.

1994
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:40,530
Marius opened a drawer and took out the two
guns which Inspector Javert had lent him in

1995
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:41,530
February.

1996
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:42,530
Putting them in his jacket pocket, he went
out and continued to wander aimlessly around

1997
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:43,530
the streets, noticing only occasionally the
strange atmosphere of excitement that was

1998
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,530
growing in the town.

1999
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:45,530
People were running around, and there was
a lot of noise, but Marius paid little attention.

2000
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:46,530
He could think of only one thing: his meeting
later that evening with Cosette.

2001
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:47,530
This would be his last brief happiness; after
that, there would be only darkness.

2002
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,530
At nine o'clock that evening, Marius crept
into the garden of Cosette's house, but she

2003
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:49,530
was not there waiting for him as she had promised.

2004
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:50,530
Looking up, he saw that there were no lights
on in the house and that all the windows were

2005
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,530
closed.

2006
01:49:51,530 --> 01:49:52,530
Unable to control himself, he beat his fists
against the walls of the house.

2007
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:53,530
'Cosette!' he cried, not caring who heard
him.

2008
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:54,530
'Where are you?'

2009
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:55,530
He called her name again and again until,
exhausted, he sat down on the stone steps.

2010
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:56,530
Now she was gone, he told himself, he had
no future.

2011
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:57,530
There was nothing for him to do except die.

2012
01:49:57,530 --> 01:49:58,530
Suddenly he heard a voice calling through
the trees from the street.

2013
01:49:58,530 --> 01:49:59,530
'M. Marius!'

2014
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:00,530
He looked up.

2015
01:50:00,530 --> 01:50:01,530
'Who's that?'

2016
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:02,530
'Is that you, M. Marius?'

2017
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:03,530
'Yes.'

2018
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:04,530
'Your friends are waiting for you at the barricade
in the rue de Chanvrerie.'

2019
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:05,530
Marius ran to the gate and was just in time
to see the figure of Eponine, Thenardier's

2020
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:06,530
daughter, disappearing into the shadows at
the end of the street.

2021
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:07,530
CHAPTER TEN
The Barricade

2022
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:08,530
In the spring of 1832, the people of Paris
were ready for revolution.

2023
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,530
Charles X, who had become king in 1824, believed
that he had total power over the French people.

2024
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:10,530
He was a strong supporter of the Catholic
church and the aristocracy, and he took away

2025
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:11,530
the freedoms that Napoleon had given the ordinary
citizens.

2026
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:12,530
Although this made him very unpopular, he
thought that his opponents would be too weak

2027
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:13,530
to prevent him from doing what he wanted.

2028
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:14,530
He was wrong.

2029
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,530
In 1830, there was a peaceful revolution,
and he was forced to leave.

2030
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:16,530
The new king, Louis-Philippe, was a brave
and clever man who loved his country.

2031
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:17,530
The ordinary people liked him at first, but
he soon showed that he was more interested

2032
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:18,530
in power for his family than democracy for
his people.

2033
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:19,530
He understood business, but he could not understand
the problems of poor people.

2034
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:20,530
Neither could he understand the concept of
freedom of speech, and he often sent soldiers

2035
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,530
into the streets to attack people who were
making public protests.

2036
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:22,530
As the summer approached, the mood of the
workers and the poor became angrier and angrier.

2037
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:23,530
Their anger exploded into violence in June
1832, when General Lamarque died.

2038
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:24,530
The General had been very popular with the
people of France because of his love for Napoleon.

2039
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:25,530
The day of his funeral was arranged for 5
June, and thousands of people saw this as

2040
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:26,530
a chance to make a public protest against
the king and his government.

2041
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:27,530
At first, the funeral went quietly.

2042
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:28,530
Soldiers accompanied the coffin as it was
carried slowly across Paris.

2043
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:29,530
A large crowd followed behind, waving flags
and carrying swords and heavy sticks.

2044
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:30,530
The crowd grew more and more excited, until
finally they tried to take the coffin away

2045
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:31,530
from the soldiers and carry it across a bridge.

2046
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:32,530
Their exit was blocked by more soldiers on
horseback.

2047
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:33,530
For a moment, nothing happened.

2048
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:34,530
Then there were two gunshots.

2049
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:35,530
The first shot killed the commander of the
soldiers guarding the exit to the bridge.

2050
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:36,530
The second killed a deaf old woman who was
trying to shut her window.

2051
01:50:36,530 --> 01:50:37,530
Then the fighting started.

2052
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:38,530
Soldiers attacked the crowd with swords; the
crowd threw stones and ran screaming across

2053
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:39,530
the bridge.

2054
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:40,530
Minutes later, the sounds of war echoed across
the whole city of Paris.

2055
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:41,530
***

2056
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:42,530
As soon as the fighting started, Enjolras
and several of his friends started to build

2057
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:43,530
a barricade outside the Corinth wine shop
in the rue de la Chanvrerie, a small street

2058
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:44,530
surrounded by dark alleys in the market district
of Paris.

2059
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:45,530
Enjolras had been joined by many strangers
as he and his friends had run shouting along

2060
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:46,530
the street.

2061
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:47,530
There was a tall, grey-haired man whom nobody
knew, but whose strong, brave face had impressed

2062
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:48,530
everybody.

2063
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:49,530
There were several street children, excited
by the sound of battle, who also joined them.

2064
01:50:49,530 --> 01:50:50,530
One of these children was Eponine, who had
dressed like a boy so that no one would tell

2065
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:51,530
her to go home.

2066
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:52,530
Having run to tell Marius that his friends
were waiting for him, she was helping Enjolras

2067
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:53,530
and his companions to build the barricade.

2068
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:54,530
New people arrived all the time, bringing
with them gunpowder and weapons to fight the

2069
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:55,530
soldiers who would be arriving very soon.

2070
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:56,530
Enjolras, who was the leader of the rebels,
organized the building of a second barricade

2071
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:57,530
and the manufacture of bullets from melted
silver.

2072
01:50:57,530 --> 01:50:58,530
The tall, grey-haired man was doing useful
work on the larger barricade, and Eponine

2073
01:50:58,530 --> 01:50:59,530
(whom everyone thought was a boy) worked hard
too.

2074
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:00,530
The barricades were finished in less than
an hour and, with the sound of drums in the

2075
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,530
city growing louder, Enjolras brought a table
out into the street and sat down with his

2076
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:02,530
friends for a drink.

2077
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:03,530
Night fell, but nothing happened.

2078
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:04,530
While the fifty men behind the barricade waited
impatiently for the arrival of sixty thousand

2079
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:05,530
soldiers, Enjolras approached the tall, grey-haired
man.

2080
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:06,530
'Who are you?' he asked.

2081
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:07,530
When the man said nothing, Enjolras became
suspicious.

2082
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:08,530
'You're a policeman, aren't you?' he said.

2083
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:09,530
The man smiled and eventually admitted that
he was.

2084
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:10,530
'My name's Javert,' he said.

2085
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:11,530
Before he could move, Enjolras ordered four
men to search him.

2086
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:12,530
When they found a letter in his pocket which
proved that he had been sent to spy on them,

2087
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:13,530
they tied him to a post inside the inn,

2088
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:14,530
'You'll be shot two minutes before the barricade
falls,' Enjolras informed him.

2089
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:15,530
***

2090
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:16,530
Marius left the garden and, mad with grief
at losing Cosette, walked towards the sound

2091
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:17,530
of drums and gunfire in the centre of the
city.

2092
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:18,530
He had only one thought in his mind: he wanted
to die.

2093
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:19,530
Marius pushed his way through the crowds of
frightened, murmuring people that filled the

2094
01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:20,530
streets until he reached the market area.

2095
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:21,530
Here, he found the unlit streets suddenly
filled with soldiers.

2096
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:22,530
Unafraid, Marius ran through the shadows,
ignoring shouts for him to stop.

2097
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:23,530
Someone fired a gun and a bullet hit a wall
just behind him, but he didn't care.

2098
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:24,530
He was just approaching the rue de Chanvrerie
when he heard a loud voice calling from the

2099
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:25,530
shadows: 'Who's there?'

2100
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:26,530
'The French Revolution!' he heard a distant
voice reply - the voice of his friend, Enjolras.

2101
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,530
Marius stood behind an alley wall, hidden
in the shadows.

2102
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:28,530
Around the corner, he could see a row of soldiers
aiming their guns down the rue de Chanvrerie,

2103
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:29,530
waiting for the order to fire.

2104
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:30,530
'Fire!'

2105
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:31,530
the order finally came.

2106
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:32,530
The street was lit with a sudden flash of
light and filled with the thunder of gunfire.

2107
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:33,530
Then the soldiers attacked.

2108
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:34,530
Marius stood up and ran along a series of
alleys that led into the rue de la Chanvrerie,

2109
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:35,530
behind the Corinth wine shop.

2110
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:36,530
When he reached the stronghold, soldiers were
already climbing the barricade, shooting at

2111
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:37,530
the rebels.

2112
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:38,530
Marius saw a soldier attacking Enjolras, who
had fallen backwards and was calling for help.

2113
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:39,530
Marius took Javert's guns from his pockets
and shot the soldier dead.

2114
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:40,530
Soldiers now occupied the top of the barricade,
but were unable to advance any further because

2115
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:41,530
the defenders fought so fiercely.

2116
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:42,530
Marius, who had thrown away his guns and was
now without a weapon, began to move towards

2117
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:43,530
a barrel of gunpowder he had seen near the
door of the wine shop.

2118
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,530
He did not notice a soldier aiming his gun
at him.

2119
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,530
Neither did he see, at the moment the soldier
fired, a young boy dressed in rags jump in

2120
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:46,530
front of the gun and fall wounded as the bullet
meant for Marius hit him in the hand.

2121
01:51:46,530 --> 01:51:47,530
'Put down your weapons and surrender!'

2122
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:48,530
a soldier called from the top of the barricade.

2123
01:51:48,530 --> 01:51:49,530
'Fire!'

2124
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:50,530
Enjolras shouted.

2125
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:51,530
The soldiers and the rebels fired at each
other at the same time, filling the air with

2126
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:52,530
thick clouds of dark smoke.

2127
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:53,530
When the smoke cleared, there were many dead
bodies on both sides.

2128
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:54,530
The survivors were reloading their guns in
silence, when suddenly a loud voice called,

2129
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:55,530
'Get out now, or I'll blow up the barricade!'

2130
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,530
All heads turned to stare in the direction
of the voice.

2131
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:57,530
Marius was standing at the foot of the barricade,
holding a flaming torch above a barrel of

2132
01:51:57,530 --> 01:51:58,530
gunpowder.

2133
01:51:58,530 --> 01:51:59,530
'If you blow up the barricade,' a sergeant
called, 'you'll blow up yourself as well!'

2134
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,530
Marius smiled and lowered the torch towards
the gunpowder.

2135
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:01,530
Within seconds, the soldiers had left the
barricade, leaving their dead and wounded

2136
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:02,530
behind, and were running into the darkness
at the far end of the street.

2137
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:03,530
Enjolras threw his arms around Marius's neck.

2138
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:04,530
'So you've come!' he cried.

2139
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:05,530
Marius hugged Enjolras and many other friends
he recognized.

2140
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:06,530
While the soldiers waited at the far end of
the street for further orders, and the rebels

2141
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:07,530
removed dead bodies from the barricade and
took care of the wounded, Marius walked around

2142
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:08,530
the stronghold in a kind of dream.

2143
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:09,530
After two months of happiness with Cosette,
he was now in the middle of a war.

2144
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:10,530
He could not believe this was happening to
him.

2145
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:11,530
He was so confused that he did not recognize
Javert, tied to a post inside the inn throughout

2146
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:12,530
the battle.

2147
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:13,530
As he was walking by the smaller barricade,
his thoughts were interrupted by a weak voice

2148
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,530
calling his name from the shadows.

2149
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:15,530
'M. Marius!'

2150
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:16,530
He looked about him but, seeing no one, he
started to walk away, thinking that he was

2151
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:17,530
imagining things.

2152
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,530
'M. Marius!'

2153
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:19,530
He heard the voice again.

2154
01:52:19,530 --> 01:52:20,530
Marius gazed into the shadows, but could still
see nothing.

2155
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:21,530
'I'm at your feet,' the voice said.

2156
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:22,530
Looking down, Marius saw a dark shape crawling
along the ground towards him.

2157
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:23,530
By the light of a lamp on the pavement, he
could see a torn jacket, trousers with holes

2158
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,530
in them, and two bare feet.

2159
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:25,530
A white face was turned towards him and the
voice asked, 'Do you recognize me?

2160
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,530
It's Eponine.'

2161
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:27,530
Marius bent down quickly, and saw that it
was indeed that unhappy girl, dressed in a

2162
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:28,530
man's clothes.

2163
01:52:28,530 --> 01:52:29,530
'What are you doing here?' he said.

2164
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:30,530
Then, noticing the pool of blood on the ground
behind her, cried, 'You're wounded!

2165
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:31,530
I'll carry you to the inn.

2166
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:32,530
They'll take care of you there.

2167
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,530
Is it very bad?'

2168
01:52:33,530 --> 01:52:34,530
She showed him the bullet hole in her hand.

2169
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:35,530
'A soldier was going to shoot you,' she said,
her voice no more than a whisper.

2170
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:36,530
'But I put my hand in front of his gun.'

2171
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:37,530
'You poor child,' Marius said.

2172
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:38,530
'We'll put a bandage on that wound immediately.

2173
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:39,530
You'll be all right.'

2174
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:40,530
'The bullet passed through my hand,' Eponine
murmured, 'but it came out through my back.

2175
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:41,530
It's no use trying to move me, but I'll tell
you how you can treat my wound better than

2176
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:42,530
any doctor.

2177
01:52:42,530 --> 01:52:43,530
Sit down on that stone, close beside me.'

2178
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:44,530
Marius sat next to her.

2179
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:45,530
She rested her head on his knee and said without
looking at him, 'Oh, what happiness.

2180
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:46,530
Now I don't feel any pain,'

2181
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:47,530
For a moment she was silent.

2182
01:52:47,530 --> 01:52:48,530
She pressed her hand to her chest, from which
blood was pouring like dark wine.

2183
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:49,530
Then, with a great effort, she raised herself
on one arm and, struggling for breath, looked

2184
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,530
into Marius's eyes.

2185
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:51,530
'I can't cheat you,' she said at last.

2186
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:52,530
'I have a letter for you in my pocket.

2187
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:53,530
I've had it since yesterday.

2188
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:54,530
I was asked to post it, but I didn't.

2189
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:55,530
I didn't want you to get it.

2190
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:56,530
But now we're both going to die, it doesn't
matter, does it?

2191
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,530
I can't be jealous any more.

2192
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,530
Take your letter.'

2193
01:52:58,530 --> 01:52:59,530
She took hold of Marius's hand with her wounded
hand and, without seeming to feel the pain,

2194
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:00,530
guided it to her pocket, from which he took
the letter.

2195
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:01,530
'Now you must promise me something for my
trouble,' she said.

2196
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:02,530
'You must kiss me on the forehead after I'm
dead...

2197
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:03,530
I shall know.'

2198
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:04,530
She let her head fall back on his knees.

2199
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:05,530
Her eyelids trembled, and then she was still.

2200
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:06,530
Just as Marius thought that her sad soul had
finally left her body, she slowly opened her

2201
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,530
eyes, and said in a voice so sweet that it
seemed already to come from another world,

2202
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:08,530
'You know, M. Marius, I think I was a little
bit in love with you.'

2203
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:09,530
With those words, she closed her eyes for
the last time and died.

2204
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:10,530
Marius kissed her pale forehead and laid her
gently on the ground.

2205
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:11,530
Then he returned to the wine shop, and opened
the letter that she had given him.

2206
01:53:11,530 --> 01:53:12,530
By candlelight he read,

2207
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:13,530
My dearest, We are leaving this house at once.

2208
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:14,530
We go tonight to Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme,
and in a week we shall be in England.

2209
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:15,530
Cosette, 4 June.

2210
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:16,530
Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses.

2211
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:17,530
So she still loved him!

2212
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:18,530
He thought for a moment that now he must not
die, but then he thought, 'She's going away.'

2213
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:19,530
She was going with her father to England,
and his grandfather had refused to give his

2214
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:20,530
permission for him to marry.

2215
01:53:20,530 --> 01:53:21,530
Nothing had changed, and he decided that he
had one last duty to perform: he must send

2216
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:22,530
Cosette a final message and tell her of his
death.

2217
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:23,530
He tore a page out of the pocket notebook
he always carried and wrote:

2218
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:24,530
Our marriage was impossible.

2219
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:25,530
I went to my grandfather, and he refused to
give his permission.

2220
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:26,530
I have no money, and neither have you.

2221
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:27,530
I hurried to see you, but you had gone.

2222
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:28,530
You remember the promise I made you.

2223
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:29,530
I shall keep it.

2224
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,530
I shall die.

2225
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:31,530
I love you.

2226
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:32,530
When you read this, my soul will be very near
and smiling at you.

2227
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:33,530
He folded the letter, wrote Cosette's new
address on the back and called over a young

2228
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:34,530
boy.

2229
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:35,530
'What's your name?' he asked the boy.

2230
01:53:35,530 --> 01:53:36,530
'Gavroche.'

2231
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:37,530
'Well, Gavroche, will you do something for
me?

2232
01:53:37,530 --> 01:53:38,530
I want you to deliver this letter to the address
written on the outside.'

2233
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:39,530
The boy scratched his head, thought for a
moment, and then, with a sudden movement,

2234
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:40,530
took the letter and ran off into the night.

2235
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:41,530
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Letter

2236
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:42,530
Jean Valjean, at that moment, was in a state
of terrible shock.

2237
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:43,530
For the first time in their life together,
he and Cosette had quarrelled.

2238
01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:44,530
She had not wanted to leave the house, but
she had eventually obeyed him.

2239
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:45,530
They had left quickly, at nightfall, bringing
their servant, Toussaint, with them, but very

2240
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:46,530
little luggage.

2241
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,530
Cosette had brought her letter case and blotter
with her, Valjean his box of child's clothing

2242
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:48,530
and the old National Guard uniform which all
respectable men possessed, and which he had

2243
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,530
worn under a previous identity.

2244
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:50,530
In their new house, they went to bed in silence.

2245
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:51,530
Cosette, however, did not leave her bedroom
the next day, and Jean Valjean had dinner

2246
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,530
alone.

2247
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:53,530
As he was eating, Toussaint told him about
the fighting in the city, but he did not pay

2248
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:54,530
much attention.

2249
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:55,530
He was too worried about Cosette.

2250
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:56,530
There was no reason, he thought, why they
should not continue to live happily together

2251
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:57,530
in England.

2252
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:58,530
As long as he had Cosette, he would be happy,
and it did not matter where they lived.

2253
01:53:58,530 --> 01:53:59,530
He began to feel happier as he thought about
the journey they would soon be making.

2254
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:00,530
He stood up and was going to leave the room
when something made him stop.

2255
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:01,530
He glanced again at the mirror.

2256
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:02,530
Cosette's blotter was lying on a cupboard
just below it and, as Valjean stared at its

2257
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:03,530
reflection, he read the following lines:

2258
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:04,530
My dearest, We are leaving this house at once.

2259
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:05,530
We go tonight to Number 7, rue de 1'Homme-Arme,
and in a week we shall be in England.

2260
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:06,530
Cosette, 4June.

2261
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:07,530
In her unhappy state of mind, Cosette had
forgotten to remove the page that she had

2262
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:08,530
used to blot the letter she had written to
Marius.

2263
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:09,530
She had left it on the cupboard and the mirror,
reflecting the backwards handwriting, made

2264
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:10,530
the message clearly visible.

2265
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:11,530
Valjean moved closer to the mirror and read
the lines again, not wanting to believe them.

2266
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:12,530
But there was no doubt that this was Cosette's
handwriting.

2267
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:13,530
He began to shake and he fell back into an
armchair, feeling angry and betrayed.

2268
01:54:13,530 --> 01:54:14,530
He had suffered terribly over the years and,
until now, he had survived every disaster.

2269
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:15,530
But this was the worst thing that had ever
happened to him - someone was threatening

2270
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:16,530
to rob him of the only person he loved!

2271
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:17,530
He murmured to himself, 'She's going to leave
me,' and the pain of those words cut into

2272
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:18,530
his heart like a knife.

2273
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:19,530
After a short time, he rose to his feet and
looked again at the blotter.

2274
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:20,530
His anger and misery of minutes before had
been replaced by a terrible calmness.

2275
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:21,530
He stared at the blotter, coldness in his
eyes, the darkness of the deepest night in

2276
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:22,530
his heart.

2277
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:23,530
He remembered clearly the young man in the
Luxembourg Gardens who had shown such great

2278
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:24,530
interest in Cosette, and he was certain that
this was the man she had written to.

2279
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:25,530
He went out into the night and sat on the
doorstep, his heart filled with a terrible

2280
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:26,530
hatred for the man who was trying to steal
Cosette from him.

2281
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:27,530
He sat for a long time listening to the sound
of distant gunfire in the city, wondering

2282
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:28,530
how to get his revenge, when suddenly he heard
footsteps.

2283
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:29,530
Looking up, he saw a pale-faced boy, dressed
in rags, studying the numbers of the houses

2284
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:30,530
in the street.

2285
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:31,530
Seeing Valjean on his doorstep, the boy stopped
and asked, 'Do you live in this street?'

2286
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:32,530
'Yes.

2287
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:33,530
Why?'

2288
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:34,530
'I'm looking for Number Seven.

2289
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:35,530
I have a letter for a girl who lives here.'

2290
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,530
'Well, I'm the girl's father.

2291
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:37,530
You can give the letter to me.

2292
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,530
Oh, and one more thing before you go,'Valjean
said when the boy had handed him the letter.

2293
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:39,530
'Where should I take the reply?'

2294
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:40,530
'That letter comes from the barricade in the
rue de la Chanvrerie,' the boy replied.

2295
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:41,530
'Which is where I'm going now.

2296
01:54:41,530 --> 01:54:42,530
Goodnight citizen.'

2297
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:43,530
Jean Valjean went back into the house and
tried to make sense of the words that danced

2298
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:44,530
before his eyes: I shall die...

2299
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:45,530
When you read this, my soul will be very near...

2300
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:46,530
This was enough to fill his hate-filled heart
with sudden joy.

2301
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:47,530
So, the problem was solved!

2302
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:48,530
The man who threatened his happiness was going
to die - was perhaps already dead.

2303
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:49,530
Then Valjean frowned and, after a quick calculation,
decided that Marius was probably still alive.

2304
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:50,530
But it made no difference.

2305
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:51,530
He was still certain to die, and Valjean's
happiness would be safe.

2306
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:52,530
If he kept the letter in his pocket, Cosette
would never know what had happened to the

2307
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:53,530
other man, and life with her would continue
the same as before.

2308
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:54,530
What happiness!

2309
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:55,530
But his happiness had no sooner returned than
it disappeared again in a cloud of despair.

2310
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:56,530
In his heart he knew he had no choice.

2311
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:57,530
For the sake of Cosette's happiness, he would
have to try and save the life of the man she

2312
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:58,530
loved - the man he hated more than any other
in the world.

2313
01:54:58,530 --> 01:54:59,530
Half an hour later he left the house, dressed
in his National Guard uniform, with a loaded

2314
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:00,530
gun and a pocket full of gunpowder, and made
his way towards the market district of Paris.

2315
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:01,530
CHAPTER TWELVE
Fight to the Death

2316
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:02,530
During the night, the thirty-seven remaining
rebels strengthened the main barricade and

2317
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:03,530
made more bullets.

2318
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:04,530
The ground floor of the wine shop became a
hospital for the wounded, and the bodies of

2319
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:05,530
the dead were taken to an alley near the smaller
of the two barricades.

2320
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:06,530
Four of the dead people were National Guards,
and their uniforms were removed.

2321
01:55:06,530 --> 01:55:07,530
After a long discussion with his friends,
Enjolras decided that the married men (there

2322
01:55:07,530 --> 01:55:08,530
were five of them) had to leave.

2323
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:09,530
'It's your duty not to die,' he told them.

2324
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,530
'You must return to your families.'

2325
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:11,530
'How can we leave?'

2326
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:12,530
they protested.

2327
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:13,530
'We're surrounded.

2328
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:14,530
The soldiers will shoot us as soon as they
see us.'

2329
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:15,530
'You can wear these.'

2330
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:16,530
Enjolras pointed to the National Guard uniforms
that had been taken off the dead soldiers.

2331
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:17,530
'But there are only four,' Marius observed.

2332
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:18,530
'Then one of us must stay and fight,' one
of the married men replied.

2333
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:19,530
A long argument followed, during which each
of the married men tried to persuade the others

2334
01:55:19,530 --> 01:55:20,530
to go.

2335
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:21,530
Finally, someone shouted to Marius, 'You decide
which one must stay.'

2336
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:22,530
Marius went pale at the thought of having
to choose which man had to die.

2337
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:23,530
He stared down at the four uniforms but, as
he did so, a fifth uniform fell as if by magic

2338
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:24,530
at his feet.

2339
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:25,530
Looking round, Marius recognized Cosette's
father.

2340
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:26,530
Jean Valjean, who had arrived unnoticed at
the barricade, had been listening to the argument

2341
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:27,530
and had quickly understood the situation.

2342
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:28,530
'Now you can all leave,' he said.

2343
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:29,530
The sky grew lighter, but not a door or window
was open in the street.

2344
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:30,530
The barricade was stronger than it had been
for the first assault, and the rebels were

2345
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:31,530
at their positions, guns loaded and ready
for action.

2346
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:32,530
They did not have long to wait.

2347
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:33,530
Sounds of chains and of heavy wheels moving
along the stone streets could be heard, and

2348
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:34,530
then soldiers came into view at the end of
the street, pulling a large cannon.

2349
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:35,530
The rebels fired their guns but, when the
smoke had cleared, they saw the soldiers,

2350
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,530
unharmed, steadily aiming the cannon at the
barricade.

2351
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:37,530
Moments later, an officer shouted a command
and the cannon roared into action.

2352
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:38,530
The cannonball crashed into the bottom of
the barricade with a loud explosion, but did

2353
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:39,530
little damage.

2354
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:40,530
The rebels clapped and cheered.

2355
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:41,530
More soldiers moved into position at the end
of the street, behind the cannon, and started

2356
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:42,530
to build a low wall with pieces of broken
stone.

2357
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:43,530
At the same time, the leader of the gun crew
adjusted the aim of the cannon.

2358
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:44,530
'Heads down!'

2359
01:55:44,530 --> 01:55:45,530
Enjolras shouted.

2360
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:46,530
The next cannonball exploded against the wall
at one end of the barricade, killing two men

2361
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:47,530
and wounding three.

2362
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:48,530
'We mustn't let that happen again,' Enjolras
said.

2363
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:49,530
He aimed his gun over the barricade at the
leader of the gun crew, and fired.

2364
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:50,530
The gunner - a fair-haired, handsome young
man - spun round twice with his head thrown

2365
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:51,530
back, and fell sideways across the cannon.

2366
01:55:51,530 --> 01:55:52,530
Blood poured from the middle of his back.

2367
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,530
A tear rolled down Enjolras's cheek.

2368
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:54,530
'It's sad,' he murmured to Marius, who was
standing next to him.

2369
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,530
'He looked a brave young man.'

2370
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:56,530
***

2371
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:57,530
The battle continued for some time; the cannon
destroyed the upper windows of the wine shop,

2372
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:58,530
and did some damage to the barricade, but
the rebels did not withdraw.

2373
01:55:58,530 --> 01:55:59,530
They fired back at the soldiers, killing many
men.

2374
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:00,530
In the pauses between shooting, the rebels
could hear the sound of fighting in other

2375
01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:01,530
parts of Paris.

2376
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:02,530
They were filled with hope that help would
come soon, but the hope did not last long.

2377
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:03,530
Within half an hour the sound of gunfire in
other places had stopped, and the rebels knew

2378
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:04,530
that they were alone.

2379
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:05,530
When a second cannon was moved into position
next to the first, they knew that the end

2380
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:06,530
was near.

2381
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:07,530
Both cannons fired together, accompanied by
gunfire from soldiers at the end of the street

2382
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:08,530
and on the rooftops.

2383
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:09,530
As other guns began firing at the smaller
barricade, the rebels fought back bravely,

2384
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:10,530
but they were running out of bullets.

2385
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:11,530
There were only twenty-six men left, and the
main attack on the barricade was going to

2386
01:56:11,530 --> 01:56:12,530
take place very soon.

2387
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:13,530
Some men, including Marius, stayed on the
main barricade, while the others built a low

2388
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:14,530
stone wall around the door of the wine shop.

2389
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:15,530
Enjolras, inside the wine shop, turned to
Javert, who was still tied to the post.

2390
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:16,530
'I haven't forgotten you,' he said, putting
a loaded gun on the table.

2391
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:17,530
'The last man to leave this place will blow
your brains out.'

2392
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:18,530
At this point, Jean Valjean spoke to Enjolras.

2393
01:56:18,530 --> 01:56:19,530
'You're the leader, aren't you?

2394
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:20,530
Can I ask you for a favour?'

2395
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:21,530
'You saved a man's life by giving him your
uniform.

2396
01:56:21,530 --> 01:56:22,530
You deserve some reward.

2397
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:23,530
What do you want?'

2398
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:24,530
'Let me kill this man.'

2399
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:25,530
'That's fair,' Enjolras decided, when nobody
objected.

2400
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:26,530
'You can have your spy.'

2401
01:56:26,530 --> 01:56:27,530
At the same moment there was the sound of
a drum, followed by a loud roar.

2402
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:28,530
'They're coming!'

2403
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:29,530
cried Marius from the top of the barricade.

2404
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:30,530
The rebels rushed to their positions, leaving
Valjean alone with Javert inside the wine

2405
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:31,530
shop.

2406
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:32,530
Valjean untied the rope around Javert's feet
and, taking him by the belt of his coat, led

2407
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:33,530
him outside.

2408
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:34,530
Only Marius, looking over his shoulder, saw
them cross the stronghold towards the smaller

2409
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:35,530
barricade.

2410
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:36,530
Valjean, his gun in one hand, pulled Javert
behind him over the barricade and into a narrow

2411
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:37,530
alley, where the corner of a house hid them
from view.

2412
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:38,530
A terrible heap of dead bodies lay not far
away, among them the blood-stained body of

2413
01:56:38,530 --> 01:56:39,530
a young girl in man's clothes - Eponine.

2414
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:40,530
Javert glanced at the dead body and murmured,
'I think I know that girl.

2415
01:56:40,530 --> 01:56:41,530
'Then, returning his attention to Valjean,
he said calmly, 'I think you know me, too.

2416
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:42,530
Take your revenge.'

2417
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:43,530
Valjean, however, took a knife from his pocket
and cut the ropes that tied Javert's wrists.

2418
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:44,530
'You're free to go,' he said.

2419
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,530
When Javert stared at him, speechless with
surprise, Valjean went on, I don't suppose

2420
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:46,530
I'll leave here alive.

2421
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,530
But if I do, I'm staying at Number 7, rue
de l'Homme-Arme.

2422
01:56:47,530 --> 01:56:48,530
Now go.'

2423
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,530
Javert buttoned his coat, straightened his
shoulders and, with a puzzled look on his

2424
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:50,530
face, began to walk off in the direction of
the market.

2425
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:51,530
He had only gone a few steps, however, when
he turned and looked at Valjean.

2426
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:52,530
'I find this embarrassing,' he said.

2427
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:53,530
'I'd rather you killed me.'

2428
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,530
'Go away,' Valjean replied.

2429
01:56:54,530 --> 01:56:55,530
Javert walked away slowly and Valjean, waiting
for him to turn a corner, fired his gun into

2430
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:56,530
the air and returned to the stronghold.

2431
01:56:56,530 --> 01:56:57,530
'It's done,' he said.

2432
01:56:57,530 --> 01:56:58,530
***

2433
01:56:58,530 --> 01:56:59,530
There was a roar of gunfire and the soldiers
attacked, rushing towards the barricade.

2434
01:56:59,530 --> 01:57:00,530
Many fell, but many more reached the barricade.

2435
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:01,530
The first assault was beaten back by the brave
rebels, but the soldiers attacked again and

2436
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:02,530
again.

2437
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:03,530
Soon, the ground below the barricade was piled
with dead and wounded men as the rebels and

2438
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:04,530
soldiers fought hand to hand.

2439
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:05,530
The rebels fought long and hard to defend
the stronghold, but finally they had to withdraw

2440
01:57:05,530 --> 01:57:06,530
to the low wall outside the wine shop.

2441
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:07,530
They stood with their backs to the door, shooting
up at the soldiers who were climbing down

2442
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:08,530
towards them from the barricade.

2443
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:09,530
One by one the remaining rebels escaped into
the wine shop, until only Enjolras and Marius

2444
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:10,530
were left outside.

2445
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:11,530
As the two friends moved back towards the
door, fighting off the soldiers, a bullet

2446
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:12,530
hit Marius in the shoulder.

2447
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:13,530
His eyes closed and, in great pain, he felt
a hand grab him as he fell.

2448
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:14,530
'They've taken me prisoner,' he thought, moments
before losing consciousness.

2449
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:15,530
'Now I shall be shot.'

2450
01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:16,530
The soldiers, meanwhile, attacked the wine
shop.

2451
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:17,530
Before long, they broke down the door and
rushed inside.

2452
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:18,530
Enjolras and the few surviving rebels fought
bravely, but the soldiers were too strong.

2453
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:19,530
Soon, all the rebels were dead, including
Enjolras, who was the last to die.

2454
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:20,530
Sword in hand, surrounded by soldiers, he
refused to surrender.

2455
01:57:20,530 --> 01:57:21,530
He died in a rain of bullets with a strangely
victorious smile on his lips.

2456
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:22,530
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Sewers of Paris

2457
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:23,530
Marius had indeed been taken prisoner, but
not by the soldiers.

2458
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:24,530
It was Jean Valjean's hand that had caught
him as he fell.

2459
01:57:24,530 --> 01:57:25,530
Valjean had taken no part in the battle.

2460
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:26,530
He had been looking after wounded men while
bullets flew all around him.

2461
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:27,530
When Marius had been hit, Valjean ran to him
at once, grabbed him before he fell and carried

2462
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:28,530
his unconscious body into a small alley behind
the wine shop.

2463
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:29,530
Valjean lowered Marius to the ground, stood
with his back to the wall and looked around

2464
01:57:29,530 --> 01:57:30,530
him.

2465
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:31,530
The situation was terrible.

2466
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:32,530
There seemed to be no escape.

2467
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:33,530
On one side of him was the field of battle.

2468
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:34,530
On the other side was the low barricade, behind
which hundreds of soldiers waited for rebels

2469
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:35,530
trying to escape.

2470
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:36,530
Both ways meant certain death.

2471
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:37,530
It was a situation that only a bird could
have escaped from.

2472
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:38,530
Valjean looked desperately around him, at
the house opposite, the barricade, the ground.

2473
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:39,530
And then he had a sudden idea!

2474
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:40,530
At the foot of the smaller barricade, half-hidden
by broken stones and pieces of wood, there

2475
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:41,530
was a hole in the road covered with an iron
grille.

2476
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:42,530
Valjean leapt forward and, using all his strength,
he moved the stones and wood, opened the grille,

2477
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:43,530
lifted Marius on to his shoulders and climbed
down into the darkness.

2478
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:44,530
A few minutes later, he found himself in a
long underground passage, a place of absolute

2479
01:57:44,530 --> 01:57:45,530
peace and silence.

2480
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:46,530
He was inside the Paris sewers.

2481
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:47,530
He could just see, by the grey light from
the grille above his head, that he was surrounded

2482
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,530
by walls.

2483
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:49,530
Ahead of him lay total darkness, but he had
to go on.

2484
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:50,530
The soldiers might discover the grille by
the barricade at any moment, and come down

2485
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:51,530
in search of him.

2486
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:52,530
With Marius lying across his shoulders, Valjean
walked forward into the darkness, feeling

2487
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:53,530
his way along the wet, slippery walls with
his hands.

2488
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:54,530
He moved from one passage into another, slipping
several times on the wet floor.

2489
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:55,530
He could not see where he was going, but he
knew he had to follow the downward slope of

2490
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:56,530
the passages towards the river.

2491
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:57,530
He walked blindly downwards in this way for
a long time, his clothes wet with the blood

2492
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:58,530
from Marius's wound, the faint whisper of
the young man's breath in his ear.

2493
01:57:58,530 --> 01:57:59,530
He walked in total darkness, the silence broken
occasionally by the thunder of gun carriages

2494
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,530
and horses racing along the streets of Paris
far above his head.

2495
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:01,530
Suddenly, he saw his own shadow on the floor
of the passage in front of him.

2496
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:02,530
Looking back, he saw the distant light of
a torch.

2497
01:58:02,530 --> 01:58:03,530
He was being followed!

2498
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:04,530
He pressed himself against the wall, held
his breath and waited.

2499
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:05,530
In the distance, a group of men formed a circle
around the torchlight.

2500
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:06,530
They seemed to be listening for something,
waiting for someone to move.

2501
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:07,530
Finally, the group of men moved off along
another passage, and Valjean was left in total

2502
01:58:07,530 --> 01:58:08,530
darkness once again.

2503
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:09,530
He continued his journey through the sewers.

2504
01:58:09,530 --> 01:58:10,530
Sometimes the roof of the passages was so
low that he had to bend down as he walked.

2505
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,530
His feet slipped all the time in the water
on the ground, and he felt sick and faint

2506
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:12,530
with the terrible, airless smell.

2507
01:58:12,530 --> 01:58:13,530
At last, exhausted, he stopped beneath a large
grille that brought him much-needed light

2508
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:14,530
and fresh air.

2509
01:58:14,530 --> 01:58:15,530
He laid Marius down gently at the edge of
the sewer, and looked down at his face.

2510
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:16,530
It was covered with blood and as pale as death.

2511
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:17,530
Valjean tore pieces oft his own shirt and
bandaged Marius's wounded shoulder as well

2512
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:18,530
as he could.

2513
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,530
Then, bending over the unconscious body, Valjean
stared at Marius with hatred in his eyes.

2514
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:20,530
He found two objects in Marius's clothing:
a piece of bread and a wallet.

2515
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:21,530
Valjean ate the bread and, opening the wallet,
found a note which Marius had written:

2516
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:22,530
My name is Marius Pontmercy.

2517
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,530
My body must be taken to the house of my grandfather,
M. Gillenormand, 6 rue des Filles-du- Calvaire,

2518
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:24,530
in the Marais.

2519
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:25,530
Valjean repeated the address until he could
remember it, returned the wallet to Marius's

2520
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:26,530
pocket, picked Marius up again and continued
his journey downwards towards the river.

2521
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:27,530
He did not know what part of the city he was
passing under or how far he had come.

2522
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:28,530
The only thing he was sure of was that the
light through the grilles far above his head

2523
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:29,530
was growing weaker, which meant that the sun
was setting.

2524
01:58:29,530 --> 01:58:30,530
At one point he had to walk waist-deep through
water, and almost sank as the ground turned

2525
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:31,530
to sand beneath his feet.

2526
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:32,530
Finally, when even his great strength was
beginning to fade, he saw ahead of him a light

2527
01:58:32,530 --> 01:58:33,530
- the clear light of day.

2528
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:34,530
He was suddenly filled with new energy at
the sight, at last, of his way of escape from

2529
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:35,530
the sewers.

2530
01:58:35,530 --> 01:58:36,530
Forgetting the weight of Marius on his shoulders
and his own hunger and tiredness, he ran towards

2531
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:37,530
the light.

2532
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:38,530
He had to bend as the roof of the tunnel became
lower, but when he reached the light, Valjean

2533
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:39,530
stopped and gave a cry of despair.

2534
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:40,530
The opening was closed with a strong iron
gate, held firm by a huge, rusty lock.

2535
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:41,530
Through the bars, Valjean could see daylight,
the river, a narrow riverbank - but how could

2536
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:42,530
he get out?

2537
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:43,530
Valjean laid Marius down by the wall, where
the floor was dry.

2538
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:44,530
Then, moving to the gate, he shook it fiercely
with both hands, trying to bend the bars with

2539
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:45,530
the last of his strength.

2540
01:58:45,530 --> 01:58:46,530
But the gate was solid and the bars were firm.

2541
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:47,530
Valjean turned his back to the gate and sank
to the ground, his head bowed between his

2542
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:48,530
knees.

2543
01:58:48,530 --> 01:58:49,530
There was no way out and, as all hope of escape
left him, he began to think of Cosette.

2544
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:50,530
***

2545
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:51,530
While in this state of despair, Valjean felt
a hand on his shoulder.

2546
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:52,530
He thought he was dreaming.

2547
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:53,530
He looked up and saw a man dressed in old
clothes standing beside him.

2548
01:58:53,530 --> 01:58:54,530
Despite the unexpectedness of this meeting,
Valjean recognized the man at once.

2549
01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:55,530
It was Thenardier.

2550
01:58:55,530 --> 01:58:56,530
Valjean did not show that he recognized the
man, and saw with relief that Thenardier had

2551
01:58:56,530 --> 01:58:57,530
not recognized him.

2552
01:58:57,530 --> 01:58:58,530
'I'll make a bargain with you,' the man said.

2553
01:58:58,530 --> 01:58:59,530
'What do you mean?'

2554
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:00,530
Thenardier nodded in Marius's direction.

2555
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:01,530
'You've killed a man.

2556
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:02,530
Give me half of what you found in this man's
pockets, and I'll unlock the gate for you.'

2557
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:03,530
He produced a large key from his pocket, and
a piece of rope.

2558
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:04,530
'I'll give you this as well,' he said.

2559
01:59:04,530 --> 01:59:05,530
'Then you can tie stones to the body and throw
it in the river.'

2560
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:06,530
Valjean took the rope without speaking.

2561
01:59:06,530 --> 01:59:07,530
'What about my share of the money?'Thenardier
asked.

2562
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:08,530
Valjean took thirty francs from his pockets
and showed it to Thenardier, who stared with

2563
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:09,530
disbelief.

2564
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:10,530
'You killed a man for just thirty francs?

2565
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:11,530
You're a fool.'

2566
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:12,530
He searched Marius's pockets himself, and
then Valjean's.

2567
01:59:12,530 --> 01:59:13,530
'It's true,' he said at last.

2568
01:59:13,530 --> 01:59:14,530
'That's all there is.

2569
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:15,530
Oh well.

2570
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:16,530
Never say that I'm not a kind man.'

2571
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:17,530
He took the thirty francs and, helping Valjean
to lift Marius on to his shoulders, he put

2572
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:18,530
the key in the lock and opened the gate just
wide enough for Valjean to pass through.

2573
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:19,530
When Valjean was outside, Thenardier closed
the gate behind him and disappeared, like

2574
01:59:19,530 --> 01:59:20,530
a rat, into the darkness of the sewers.

2575
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:21,530
***

2576
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:22,530
Valjean laid Marius gently on the grass and
stood up, surrounded by silence, enjoying

2577
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:23,530
the feeling of fresh air on his face.

2578
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:24,530
Then, just as he was bending to splash water
from the river on Marius's face, he was aware

2579
01:59:24,530 --> 01:59:25,530
of someone else standing behind him.

2580
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:26,530
He looked round quickly and saw a tall man
in a long coat, a large stick in his hand.

2581
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:27,530
Although the man's face was hidden in shadow,
Valjean recognized him as Inspector Javert.

2582
01:59:27,530 --> 01:59:28,530
Javert, however, did not recognize Valjean
at first.

2583
01:59:28,530 --> 01:59:29,530
He had been more interested in catching Thenardier,
who had escaped from prison and was known

2584
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:30,530
to be in the area.

2585
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:31,530
'Who are you?' he asked.

2586
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:32,530
Valjean told him his name and stood, without
moving, as Javert approached and stared into

2587
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:33,530
his eyes.

2588
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:34,530
'Inspector Javert,' Valjean said quietly.

2589
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:35,530
'I beg you to do me one favour.

2590
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:36,530
I promise not to try and escape.

2591
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:37,530
I gave you my address this morning, if you
remember, so you would know where to find

2592
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:38,530
me anyway.'

2593
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:39,530
Javert did not seem to hear.

2594
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:40,530
He stared into Valjean's eyes for a long time,
then, stepping back with a look of confusion

2595
01:59:40,530 --> 01:59:41,530
in his eyes, asked dreamily, 'What are you
doing here?

2596
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:42,530
Who is this man?'

2597
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:43,530
'Will you help me to take him home?'

2598
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:44,530
Valjean said.

2599
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:45,530
'He's badly injured.'

2600
01:59:45,530 --> 01:59:46,530
Javert looked unhappy, but he did not refuse.

2601
01:59:46,530 --> 01:59:47,530
Bending down, he took a handkerchief from
his pocket, wet it in the river and bathed

2602
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:48,530
Marius's blood-stained forehead.

2603
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:49,530
Then he felt Marius's wrist.

2604
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:50,530
'He's dead,' he said.

2605
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:51,530
'No, not yet,' Valjean replied, feeling in
Marius's jacket for the wallet.

2606
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:52,530
'Look,' he said, showing Javert the note with
Marius's grandfather's address.

2607
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:53,530
'That's where we need to take him.'

2608
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:54,530
Javert shouted to the driver who was waiting
for him to bring his carriage close to the

2609
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:55,530
river.

2610
01:59:55,530 --> 01:59:56,530
With Marius in the back seat, Valjean and
Javert side by side in the front, the carriage

2611
01:59:56,530 --> 01:59:57,530
drove off quickly through the dark and strangely
empty streets of Paris.

2612
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:58,530
When they arrived at M. Gillenormand's house,
a servant answered the door.

2613
01:59:58,530 --> 01:59:59,530
'Does M. Gillenormand live here?'

2614
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:00,530
Javert asked.

2615
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:01,530
'Yes.

2616
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:02,530
What do you want?'

2617
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:03,530
'We're bringing back his grandson.

2618
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:04,530
He's dead.

2619
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:05,530
Go and wake his grandfather.

2620
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:06,530
We're bringing him in.'

2621
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:07,530
Javert, Valjean and the driver carried Marius
into the house and laid him gently on a sofa

2622
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:08,530
in M. Gillenormand's sitting-room.

2623
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:09,530
While one servant ran to find a doctor and
another looked for clean sheets, Valjean felt

2624
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:10,530
Javert's hand on his arm.

2625
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:11,530
He understood, and went downstairs with Javert
close behind him.

2626
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:12,530
When they had got back into the carriage,
however, Valjean said, 'Inspector, will you

2627
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:13,530
do one last thing for me before you arrest
me?'

2628
02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:14,530
'What is it?

2629
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:15,530
'Javert replied impatiently.

2630
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,530
'Let me go home for a minute.

2631
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,530
After that, you can do whatever you want with
me.'

2632
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:18,530
Javert was silent for some moments, his chin
sunk in the collar of his overcoat.

2633
02:00:18,530 --> 02:00:19,530
Then he pulled down the window in front of
him.

2634
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:20,530
'Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme,' he told the
driver.

2635
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:21,530
Neither man spoke during the journey.

2636
02:00:21,530 --> 02:00:22,530
At the end of the rue de l'Homme-Arme, which
was too narrow for the carriage to enter,

2637
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:23,530
Javert paid the driver and accompanied Valjean
to his front door on foot.

2638
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:24,530
'Go in,' said Javert, with a strange, distant
look in his eyes.

2639
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:25,530
'I'll wait for you here.'

2640
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:26,530
Valjean went into his house and called, 'It's
me!'

2641
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:27,530
Climbing the stairs, he paused for a moment
to look out of the window to see what Javert

2642
02:00:27,530 --> 02:00:28,530
was doing.

2643
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:29,530
But the street was empty; there was no one
there.

2644
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:30,530
The next morning, Inspector Javert's body
was discovered floating in the river.

2645
02:00:30,530 --> 02:00:31,530
The poor man, unable to understand the kindness
and gentle nature of the man he had spent

2646
02:00:31,530 --> 02:00:32,530
his whole life hating, had taken his own life
by jumping from a bridge.

2647
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:33,530
It was the only way he knew to escape the
confusion that was poisoning his heart.

2648
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:34,530
***

2649
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:35,530
When M. Gillenormand saw his pale, lifeless-looking
grandson lying on the sofa, he shook from

2650
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:36,530
head to foot.

2651
02:00:36,530 --> 02:00:37,530
Leaning against the door for support, he murmured,
'Marius!'

2652
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:38,530
'He has just been brought here,' said a servant.

2653
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:39,530
'He was on the barricade and

2654
02:00:39,530 --> 02:00:40,530
'He's dead!'

2655
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:41,530
cried the old man in a terrible voice.

2656
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:42,530
'The fool!

2657
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:43,530
He did this to hurt me, the ungrateful boy.

2658
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:44,530
I try to be good to him, and this is how he
rewards me!'

2659
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:45,530
The old man walked to the window and, while
he complained to the night about the pain

2660
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:46,530
and grief his grandson had caused him, the
doctor arrived.

2661
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:47,530
After listening to Marius's heart, he organized
his removal to a bed in another room, and

2662
02:00:47,530 --> 02:00:48,530
returned to M. Gillenormand, who was still
standing by the window.

2663
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:49,530
'Will he live?'

2664
02:00:49,530 --> 02:00:50,530
M. Gillenormand asked, his eyes wild with
fear.

2665
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:51,530
'I don't know,' the doctor replied.

2666
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:52,530
'The wound to his body is not serious, but
there are deep cuts on his head.

2667
02:00:52,530 --> 02:00:53,530
It's difficult to say M. Gillenormand went
to Marius's bedside.

2668
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:54,530
'You heartless boy,' he said angrily.

2669
02:00:54,530 --> 02:00:55,530
'A fool who prefers fighting to dancing and
having fun.

2670
02:00:55,530 --> 02:00:56,530
What kind of man are you?

2671
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:57,530
Are you mad?

2672
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:58,530
But it makes no difference.

2673
02:00:58,530 --> 02:00:59,530
I too shall die.

2674
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:00,530
That makes you a murderer, a cold-hearted
killer.

2675
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:01,530
I cannot feel grief for you.

2676
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:02,530
At that moment, Marius's eyes slowly opened
and his gaze rested upon M. Gillenormand.

2677
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:03,530
'Marius!'

2678
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:04,530
the old man cried.

2679
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:05,530
'Marius, my child, grandson!

2680
02:01:05,530 --> 02:01:06,530
You're alive after all!'

2681
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:07,530
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Wedding

2682
02:01:07,530 --> 02:01:08,530
Marius lay for a long time between life and
death in a state of fever, endlessly repeating

2683
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:09,530
the name of Cosette.

2684
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:10,530
'He mustn't get excited,' the doctor warned.

2685
02:01:10,530 --> 02:01:11,530
Every day, according to one of the servants,
a white-haired, well-dressed gentleman came

2686
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,530
to ask for news of the sick man.

2687
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:13,530
Finally, after three months, the doctor announced
that Marius was out of danger.

2688
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:14,530
But he had to spend the next two months resting
because of the damage to his shoulder.

2689
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:15,530
M. Gillenormand grew happier as his grandson's
condition improved.

2690
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:16,530
He did strange, unexpected things, like running
up and down stairs without knowing why.

2691
02:01:16,530 --> 02:01:17,530
He gave his neighbour, a pretty woman, a bunch
of flowers, which greatly annoyed her husband.

2692
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:18,530
Marius, meanwhile, tried to make sense of
what had happened to him.

2693
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:19,530
He thought about Enjolras and Eponine, and
wondered why Cosette's father had been at

2694
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:20,530
the barricade.

2695
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:21,530
He could not understand why nobody could tell
him how he had been saved.

2696
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:22,530
All he knew was that he had been brought to
his grandfather's house in a carriage.

2697
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:23,530
He noticed his grandfather's tenderness towards
him, but he could not forget the old man's

2698
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:24,530
unfairness and cruelty to his father, who
had died penniless and unloved.

2699
02:01:24,530 --> 02:01:25,530
Most of all, however, he thought about Cosette,
and how he could find her again.

2700
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:26,530
'There's something I have to say to you,'
Marius told his grandfather one day.

2701
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:27,530
'What is it?'

2702
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:28,530
'I want to get married.'

2703
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:29,530
'But of course,' the old man laughed.

2704
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:30,530
'What do you mean - of course?'

2705
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:31,530
'That's understood.

2706
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:32,530
You will have your little girl.'

2707
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:33,530
'I don't understand,' Marius said, almost
speechless with amazement.

2708
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:34,530
'You will have her,' the old man repeated.

2709
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:35,530
'She comes here every day in the shape of
an old man who asks for news of you.

2710
02:01:35,530 --> 02:01:36,530
While you've been ill, she's spent her time
crying and making bandages for you.

2711
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:37,530
I know all about her.

2712
02:01:37,530 --> 02:01:38,530
She lives at Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

2713
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:39,530
You see, I'm not as unkind as you think.

2714
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:40,530
I've found out that she's a charming girl
and that she loves you.

2715
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:41,530
I knew you were angry with me, and I thought,
"What can I do to make him love me?"

2716
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:42,530
Then I thought, "I can give him Cosette."

2717
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:43,530
I wanted to invite her to see you, but the
doctor warned me that you would probably get

2718
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:44,530
too excited.

2719
02:01:44,530 --> 02:01:45,530
So I advise you, dear boy, to eat more meat
and get better soon.

2720
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:46,530
Then you can marry your Cosette and be happy.'

2721
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:47,530
Having said this, the old man burst into tears.

2722
02:01:47,530 --> 02:01:48,530
He held Marius's head to his chest and they
cried together.

2723
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:49,530
'Grandfather,' Marius said at last, 'I'm feeling
much better already.

2724
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:50,530
When can I see her?'

2725
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:51,530
'You can see her tomorrow.'

2726
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:52,530
'Why not today?'

2727
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:53,530
'All right, I'll fetch her today.

2728
02:01:53,530 --> 02:01:54,530
You've called me "grandfather"; you've shown
me that you love me after all.

2729
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:55,530
You've earned your reward!'

2730
02:01:55,530 --> 02:01:56,530
***

2731
02:01:56,530 --> 02:01:57,530
Later that day, Cosette arrived at M. Gillenormand's
house.

2732
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,530
Standing beside her on the doorstep was a
white-haired man with a strangely nervous

2733
02:01:58,530 --> 02:01:59,530
smile.

2734
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:00,530
M. Gillenormand showed them up to the room
where Marius was waiting.

2735
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:01,530
Cosette stood in the doorway, overcome with
happiness.

2736
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:02,530
She wanted to throw herself into Marius's
arms, but was unable to move, afraid to show

2737
02:02:02,530 --> 02:02:03,530
the world that she loved him.

2738
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:04,530
'Monsieur.'

2739
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:05,530
M. Gillenormand addressed Jean Valjean.

2740
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:06,530
'I have the honour, on behalf of my grandson,
Marius Pontmercy, to ask for your daughter's

2741
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,530
hand in marriage.'

2742
02:02:07,530 --> 02:02:08,530
Jean Valjean bowed.

2743
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:09,530
'Good, then that is agreed,' M. Gillenormand
said and, turning to Marius and Cosette, he

2744
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:10,530
added, 'My children, you are free to love
one another.'

2745
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:11,530
When they were alone together, Cosette and
Marius kissed.

2746
02:02:11,530 --> 02:02:12,530
'Is it really you?'

2747
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:13,530
Cosette murmured at last.

2748
02:02:13,530 --> 02:02:14,530
'I can't believe it.

2749
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:15,530
I'm so happy to see you.

2750
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:16,530
I was so excited today that I haven't even
dressed up for you.

2751
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,530
I must look terrible.

2752
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:18,530
But why don't you say something?

2753
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:19,530
Why are you letting me do all the talking?

2754
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:20,530
Do you still love me?

2755
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:21,530
Oh, I'm so wild with happiness

2756
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:22,530
'My love...'

2757
02:02:22,530 --> 02:02:23,530
Marius whispered.

2758
02:02:23,530 --> 02:02:24,530
***

2759
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:25,530
The wedding was arranged for February the
following year.

2760
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:26,530
Jean Valjean arranged everything.

2761
02:02:26,530 --> 02:02:27,530
Having been a mayor, he knew how to solve
an awkward problem: the question of Cosette's

2762
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:28,530
real family He told everybody that he was
not her father, but her guardian.

2763
02:02:28,530 --> 02:02:29,530
He also invented a dead family for Cosette,
so that everybody believed she was an orphan.

2764
02:02:29,530 --> 02:02:30,530
Valjean, as her guardian, gave Cosette a large
amount of money - half a million francs - but

2765
02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:31,530
did not tell her that the money was his.

2766
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:32,530
He told her that the money came from a man
who preferred to remain unknown.

2767
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:33,530
It was arranged that the couple, who could
not believe their sudden, new-found happiness,

2768
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:34,530
would live with M. Gillenormand after the
wedding.

2769
02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:35,530
Cosette, accompanied by Jean Valjean, visited
Marius every day.

2770
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:36,530
Marius did not speak much to Valjean.

2771
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:37,530
Despite enjoying an occasional conversation
with him, he found something strange about

2772
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:38,530
the old man.

2773
02:02:38,530 --> 02:02:39,530
He could not believe that this was the same
man he had seen at the barricade all those

2774
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:40,530
months ago - it seemed like a bad dream to
him.

2775
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:41,530
But there were more important things for Marius
to think about.

2776
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:42,530
Apart from preparing for his wedding, there
were two people that he wanted to find.

2777
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:43,530
First, there was Thenardier.

2778
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:44,530
He was, without doubt, a bad man, but Marius
had promised his father to find him and help

2779
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:45,530
him.

2780
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:46,530
He employed agents to find Thenardier, but
without success.

2781
02:02:46,530 --> 02:02:47,530
The only thing they discovered was that Mme
Thenardier had died, and that her husband

2782
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:48,530
had escaped from prison and disappeared with
his surviving daughter, Azelma.

2783
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:49,530
Second, there was the mysterious stranger
who had saved his life.

2784
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:50,530
Marius's attempts to find him also ended in
failure, and the true story of his escape

2785
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:51,530
from the barricade remained a complete mystery
to him.

2786
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:52,530
One evening, when Marius was talking to Cosette
and Jean Valjean about the mystery and his

2787
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:53,530
unsuccessful attempts to solve it, he became
angry with Cosette's guardian's lack of interest

2788
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:54,530
in his story.

2789
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:55,530
'The man was a hero,' Marius said.

2790
02:02:55,530 --> 02:02:56,530
'Do you realize, Monsieur, how brave this
man was?

2791
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:57,530
He rescued me from the field of battle and
carried me through the sewers of Paris.

2792
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:58,530
He risked his life to save a dying man, and
why?

2793
02:02:58,530 --> 02:02:59,530
He was a total stranger.

2794
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,530
He did it without any thought of a reward.

2795
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:01,530
Oh, I wish Cosette's money were mine.'

2796
02:03:01,530 --> 02:03:02,530
'It is yours,' Valjean reminded him.

2797
02:03:02,530 --> 02:03:03,530
'I would give it all,' said Marius,'to find
that man!'

2798
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:04,530
Jean Valjean was silent.

2799
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:05,530
***

2800
02:03:05,530 --> 02:03:06,530
Cosette and Marius made a handsome couple
on their wedding day.

2801
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:07,530
All previous unhappiness was forgotten as
they kissed in the church, watched proudly

2802
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,530
by M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean.

2803
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:09,530
There were flowers everywhere when they returned
to M. Gillenormand's house for the wedding

2804
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:10,530
feast.

2805
02:03:10,530 --> 02:03:11,530
It was the happiest night of Cosette's life,
spoilt only by one thing: the fact that her

2806
02:03:11,530 --> 02:03:12,530
guardian - whom she still thought of as her
father - went home before the feast had started,

2807
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:13,530
saying that he felt ill.

2808
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:14,530
But Cosette was not unhappy for long.

2809
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:15,530
She had Marius, and she would be happy with
him for the rest of her life!

2810
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:16,530
Jean Valjean, meanwhile, went home, lit his
candle and went upstairs to bed.

2811
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:17,530
That night, however, he was unable to sleep.

2812
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:18,530
He remembered the little girl he had rescued
from the Thenardiers ten years earlier, and

2813
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,530
felt sad that he was no longer the most important
man in her life.

2814
02:03:19,530 --> 02:03:20,530
Another man was the centre of her universe.

2815
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:21,530
He was proud of having helped to bring her
happiness with Marius, but another thing troubled

2816
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:22,530
his soul: the fact that nobody, not even Cosette,
knew the truth about him.

2817
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:23,530
That he was Jean Valjean, a criminal who had
spent nineteen years in prison and who had

2818
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:24,530
stolen silver candlesticks from a trusting
and kind-hearted bishop.

2819
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:25,530
He knew that if he told Cosette and Marius
the truth, he would spoil everybody's happiness

2820
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:26,530
and he would lose their love and respect.

2821
02:03:26,530 --> 02:03:27,530
On the other hand, if he continued to lie
about his past, he would lose his own soul.

2822
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:28,530
What could he do?

2823
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:29,530
***

2824
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:30,530
The next day Valjean visited M. Gillenormand's
house, and asked to speak to Marius in private.

2825
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:31,530
Marius hugged Valjean warmly, addressed him
as 'father' and invited him to lunch, but

2826
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:32,530
Valjean shook his head and said, 'Monsieur,
I have something to tell you.'

2827
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:33,530
Marius listened quietly as Valjean told him
everything about his life.

2828
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:34,530
Finally, in a state of shock and confusion,
the young man said, 'Why have you told me

2829
02:03:34,530 --> 02:03:35,530
all this?

2830
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:36,530
No one forced you to.'

2831
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:37,530
'If I had continued to keep my secret to myself,
I would have destroyed my own heart,' Valjean

2832
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:38,530
replied.

2833
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:39,530
'Besides, I belong to no family.

2834
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:40,530
Cosette was the only family I ever had.

2835
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:41,530
Everything ended for me when she married you
yesterday.

2836
02:03:41,530 --> 02:03:42,530
She is happy with the man she loves.

2837
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:43,530
I tried to persuade myself that it would be
better not to admit the truth about my past,

2838
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:44,530
but it was no use.

2839
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:45,530
I could not silence the voice that speaks
to me when I am alone.'

2840
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:46,530
Neither of them spoke for several minutes.

2841
02:03:46,530 --> 02:03:47,530
Then Marius murmured, 'Poor Cosette.

2842
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:48,530
When she hears

2843
02:03:48,530 --> 02:03:49,530
'But you must promise not to tell her!'

2844
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:50,530
Valjean interrupted.

2845
02:03:50,530 --> 02:03:51,530
'She'll be heart-broken if she hears the truth
about me.

2846
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:52,530
I don't think I could bear it...

2847
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:53,530
'

2848
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:54,530
He sank into an armchair and buried his face
in his hands.

2849
02:03:54,530 --> 02:03:55,530
'Don't worry,' Marius said at last.

2850
02:03:55,530 --> 02:03:56,530
'I'll keep your secret.

2851
02:03:56,530 --> 02:03:57,530
But I think it would be better if you stopped
seeing her.'

2852
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:58,530
'I understand,' Valjean said, rising to leave.

2853
02:03:58,530 --> 02:03:59,530
But at the door he half-turned and said, 'Monsieur,
if you will permit me, I would like to come

2854
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:00,530
and see her.

2855
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:01,530
I wouldn't come often or stay very long.

2856
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:02,530
We could meet in that little room on the ground
floor.

2857
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:03,530
Please Monsieur, if I can't see Cosette again,
I'll have nothing left to live for.

2858
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:04,530
Besides, if I suddenly stopped visiting, people
would become suspicious and begin to talk

2859
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:05,530
'You can come every evening,' said Marius.

2860
02:04:05,530 --> 02:04:06,530
'Monsieur, you are very kind,' said Jean Valjean,
shaking Marius's hand and leaving the room.

2861
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:07,530
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Truth at Last

2862
02:04:07,530 --> 02:04:08,530
Marius kept his promise about not telling
Cosette, and Valjean visited her every evening

2863
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:09,530
in a small room on the ground floor.

2864
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:10,530
It was cold and damp, but a fire had been
lit and two armchairs had been placed in front

2865
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:11,530
of it.

2866
02:04:11,530 --> 02:04:12,530
At first, Cosette could not understand why
Valjean refused to meet her upstairs.

2867
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:13,530
When he refused to kiss her cheek, she began
to feel unhappy, afraid that she had done

2868
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:14,530
something to offend him.

2869
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:15,530
She pressed his hands in hers and held them
to her lips.

2870
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:16,530
'Please, please be kind!'

2871
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:17,530
she begged.

2872
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,530
'I want you to come and live with us.

2873
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:19,530
You'll always be my father and I'm not going
to let you go.'

2874
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:20,530
He released his hands.

2875
02:04:20,530 --> 02:04:21,530
'You mustn't call me "father" any more,' he
told her.

2876
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:22,530
'You must call me "Monsieur Jean".'

2877
02:04:22,530 --> 02:04:23,530
'I don't understand,' she said, becoming angry.

2878
02:04:23,530 --> 02:04:24,530
'This is ridiculous.

2879
02:04:24,530 --> 02:04:25,530
You're upsetting me very much, and I don't
know why you're being so cruel.'

2880
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:26,530
'You don't need a father any more.

2881
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,530
You have a husband.'

2882
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:28,530
'What a thing to say!'

2883
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:29,530
Cosette replied.

2884
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:30,530
'Are you angry with me because I'm happy?'

2885
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:31,530
'Cosette,' he said, 'your happiness is the
only thing that matters to me.

2886
02:04:31,530 --> 02:04:32,530
You're happy now, and so my work is complete.'

2887
02:04:32,530 --> 02:04:33,530
With these words, he picked up his hat and
left.

2888
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:34,530
Jean Valjean continued his evening visits,
but the relationship between himself and Cosette

2889
02:04:34,530 --> 02:04:35,530
became cooler and more distant.

2890
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:36,530
She stopped calling him 'father' or asking
him questions.

2891
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:37,530
As 'Monsieur Jean', he gradually became a
different person to her, and she began not

2892
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:38,530
to depend on him for her happiness.

2893
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:39,530
Valjean would sit looking at Cosette in silence,
or would talk about incidents from their past.

2894
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:40,530
One evening in April, he called at the usual
time but was told that Cosette had gone out

2895
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:41,530
with her husband.

2896
02:04:41,530 --> 02:04:42,530
He waited in the small, damp room for an hour
before sadly returning home.

2897
02:04:42,530 --> 02:04:43,530
Over the next few days, his visits began to
be interrupted by servants calling Cosette

2898
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:44,530
to dinner.

2899
02:04:44,530 --> 02:04:45,530
When he arrived, he discovered that the fire
had not been lit, and the armchairs had been

2900
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:46,530
left near the door.

2901
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:47,530
One evening he discovered there were no chairs
in the room at all - he and Cosette had to

2902
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:48,530
stand in the cold for their whole meeting.

2903
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:49,530
Valjean realized what was happening; Marius
was telling the servants not to make him welcome

2904
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:50,530
any more.

2905
02:04:50,530 --> 02:04:51,530
That night he went home in despair, and the
next evening he did not come at all.

2906
02:04:51,530 --> 02:04:52,530
When Valjean did not appear for the second
evening, Cosette sent a servant to his house

2907
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,530
to ask if he was well.

2908
02:04:53,530 --> 02:04:54,530
Valjean replied that he was very well, but
that he had business to attend to.

2909
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:55,530
He did not return to the house again, and
Cosette was too busy with married life to

2910
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:56,530
think too much about him.

2911
02:04:56,530 --> 02:04:57,530
She did not realize that, every evening, Valjean
would walk slowly from his house until he

2912
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:58,530
reached the corner of the street where she
lived.

2913
02:04:58,530 --> 02:04:59,530
He would then stare at the house for several
minutes, tears rolling down his cheeks, before

2914
02:04:59,530 --> 02:05:00,530
turning round and slowly returning home.

2915
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:01,530
***

2916
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:02,530
Marius thought it was right to exclude Valjean
from Cosette's life.

2917
02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:03,530
He achieved this without cruelty, but without
weakness.

2918
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:04,530
Apart from the details about his life that
Valjean had confessed to him, he knew that

2919
02:05:04,530 --> 02:05:05,530
Valjean had killed Inspector Javert at the
barricade.

2920
02:05:05,530 --> 02:05:06,530
His private investigations into the old man's
past had also revealed an even more disgusting

2921
02:05:06,530 --> 02:05:07,530
fact.

2922
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:08,530
He had discovered that Valjean's money really
belonged to somebody called Monsieur Madeleine,

2923
02:05:08,530 --> 02:05:09,530
a wealthy manufacturer from Montreuil who
had mysteriously disappeared.

2924
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:10,530
He persuaded Cosette, therefore, not to use
any of the money her guardian had given her,

2925
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:11,530
and to live on the money that he had started
to earn as a lawyer.

2926
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:12,530
Cosette had not been happy about this.

2927
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:13,530
She could not understand why her father, as
she still thought of Valjean, had stopped

2928
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:14,530
visiting her.

2929
02:05:14,530 --> 02:05:15,530
She still loved him in her heart.

2930
02:05:15,530 --> 02:05:16,530
But she loved her husband even more, and she
gradually became used to not depending on

2931
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:17,530
the old man for her happiness.

2932
02:05:17,530 --> 02:05:18,530
One evening a servant brought Marius a letter,
saying, 'The writer is waiting in the hall.'

2933
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:19,530
The smell of tobacco and the handwriting on
the envelope was so familiar that Marius immediately

2934
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,530
thought of the Jondrettes.

2935
02:05:20,530 --> 02:05:21,530
He read the letter quickly.

2936
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:22,530
It was signed 'Thenard', and was asking for
money.

2937
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:23,530
Marius could not believe his luck.

2938
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:24,530
He had tried without success to find the man
who had saved his father's lite at Waterloo,

2939
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:25,530
and now the man had come to him!

2940
02:05:25,530 --> 02:05:26,530
He immediately asked the servant to show the
man in.

2941
02:05:26,530 --> 02:05:27,530
However, Marius had a shock when he saw the
man - he did not recognize him at all!

2942
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:28,530
He was an old man with a big nose, glasses
and neat grey hair.

2943
02:05:28,530 --> 02:05:29,530
He was wearing smart black clothes, and a
gold watch chain hung from his jacket pocket.

2944
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:30,530
'What do you want?'

2945
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:31,530
Marius asked coldly, as the stranger bowed
to him.

2946
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:32,530
The stranger explained in great detail how
he used to work for the government in foreign

2947
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:33,530
countries and that, now he was retired, he
wanted to move to South America with his wife

2948
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:34,530
and daughter.

2949
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:35,530
Unfortunately, it was a long journey, and
he needed money.

2950
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:36,530
'What has that to do with me?'

2951
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:37,530
'Has M. Pontmercy not read my letter?'

2952
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:38,530
Marius had only read the letter quickly, and
could not remember the details, so he said,

2953
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,530
'Go on.'

2954
02:05:39,530 --> 02:05:40,530
'I have a secret to tell you, M. Pontmercy,'
the stranger said.

2955
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:41,530
'I'll tell you the first part for nothing.

2956
02:05:41,530 --> 02:05:42,530
I think you'll be interested;

2957
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:43,530
'Well?'

2958
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:44,530
'The man you think is your wife's guardian
is a murderer and a thief.

2959
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:45,530
His name is Jean Valjean.'

2960
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:46,530
'I know that.'

2961
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:47,530
'Did you know that he spent nineteen years
in prison?'

2962
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,530
'I know that too.'

2963
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:49,530
The stranger narrowed his eyes, trying to
hide his disappointment and anger at Marius's

2964
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:50,530
calmness.

2965
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:51,530
Then he gave a strange smile.

2966
02:05:51,530 --> 02:05:52,530
'I have more information to tell you.

2967
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:53,530
It concerns money that belongs to your wife.

2968
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:54,530
It's a remarkable secret and I'll sell the
information to you for 20,000 francs.'

2969
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:55,530
'I know this secret already,' Marius said,
'just as I knew the others.'

2970
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,530
'10,000 francs?'

2971
02:05:56,530 --> 02:05:57,530
'I repeat, you have nothing to tell me.'

2972
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:58,530
'But I need to eat, Monsieur!'

2973
02:05:58,530 --> 02:05:59,530
the visitor said, losing confidence.

2974
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:00,530
'I'll tell you for twenty francs.'

2975
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:01,530
'I know it already,' Marius said.

2976
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:02,530
'I know everything.

2977
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:03,530
I even know your real name.

2978
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:04,530
It's Thenardier.'

2979
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:05,530
The visitor laughed, but Marius went on, 'You're
also Jondrette.

2980
02:06:05,530 --> 02:06:06,530
And you once had an inn in Montfermeil.'

2981
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:07,530
'I deny it!'

2982
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:08,530
'You're a completely rotten man, but I'll
give you this.'

2983
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:09,530
Marius took a banknote out of his pocket and
threw it in the stranger's face.

2984
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:10,530
'Thank you, M. Pontmercy!'

2985
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:11,530
the man said, examining the note.

2986
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,530
'500 francs!

2987
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:13,530
That's real money.

2988
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:14,530
Oh well, I suppose we can relax.'

2989
02:06:14,530 --> 02:06:15,530
With those words, he removed his false nose,
glasses and neat grey wig.

2990
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:16,530
'M. Pontmercy is absolutely right,' he said,
changing his voice.

2991
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:17,530
'I am Thenardier.'

2992
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:18,530
He waited for a few seconds to see Marius's
reaction.

2993
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:19,530
Marius, meanwhile, was grateful for finally
having the chance to help Thenardier, and

2994
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:20,530
therefore to keep the promise he had made
to his father.

2995
02:06:20,530 --> 02:06:21,530
Thenardier's presence, however, offered him
another opportunity; it gave him the chance

2996
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:22,530
to solve the mystery of Cosette's fortune.

2997
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,530
'Thenardier,' he said.

2998
02:06:23,530 --> 02:06:24,530
'Shall I tell you the secret that you were
planning to sell me?

2999
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:25,530
I, too, have sources of information, and probably
know more about the subject than you do.

3000
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:26,530
Jean Valjean, as you say, is a murderer and
a thief.

3001
02:06:26,530 --> 02:06:27,530
He's a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer
and mayor of Montreuil, M. Madeleine.

3002
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:28,530
Jean Valjean, who knew the mayor's background,
reported him to the police and took advantage

3003
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:29,530
of his arrest to take over half a million
francs from his Paris bank.

3004
02:06:29,530 --> 02:06:30,530
The manager of the bank told me this himself.

3005
02:06:30,530 --> 02:06:31,530
And he murdered the policeman, Javert.

3006
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:32,530
I know this because I was there at the time.'

3007
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:33,530
Thenardier looked puzzled for a moment, then
said, 'Monsieur, I think you are mistaken.'

3008
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:34,530
'What!

3009
02:06:34,530 --> 02:06:35,530
Are you denying what I said?

3010
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:36,530
Those are facts!'

3011
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:37,530
'They are incorrect, and I do not like to
hear a man unjustly accused.

3012
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:38,530
Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine, nor
did he kill Javert.'

3013
02:06:38,530 --> 02:06:39,530
'How do you know?'

3014
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:40,530
'First, he did not kill M. Madeleine because
he was M. Madeleine!

3015
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:41,530
And second, he did not kill Javert because
Javert killed himself.

3016
02:06:41,530 --> 02:06:42,530
He killed himself by jumping into the river.'

3017
02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:43,530
'What proof do you have?'

3018
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:44,530
Marius said, wide-eyed with disbelief.

3019
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:45,530
'I have all the proof here,' Thenardier said,
producing an envelope in which there were

3020
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:46,530
several documents and newspaper articles.

3021
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:47,530
'I've spent a long time discovering the truth
about Jean Valjean.'

3022
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:48,530
Marius studied the documents carefully, then
looked up with a smile of joy.

3023
02:06:48,530 --> 02:06:49,530
'But he's a splendid man!

3024
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:50,530
The fortune was really his, and he's not a
murderer or thief at all!

3025
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:51,530
He's a hero and a saint!'

3026
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:52,530
'He's a thief and a murderer,'Thenardier said
quietly.

3027
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:53,530
'What do you mean?'

3028
02:06:53,530 --> 02:06:54,530
'I told you that I do not like to see a man
accused unjustly, but I do like to see a man

3029
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:55,530
punished for crimes he has committed.'

3030
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:56,530
'And what crimes are those?'

3031
02:06:56,530 --> 02:06:57,530
Thenardier sat down and told Marius about
the time he had helped Valjean to escape from

3032
02:06:57,530 --> 02:06:58,530
the Paris sewer.

3033
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,530
'He was carrying the body of a man he had
robbed and killed,' Thenardier said.

3034
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:00,530
'Look, I have a piece of cloth from the dead
man's coat as proof.'

3035
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:01,530
He produced a muddy piece of cloth and showed
it to Marius, who immediately went pale and

3036
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:02,530
rose unsteadily to his feet.

3037
02:07:02,530 --> 02:07:03,530
As Thenardier continued to talk, Marius opened
a cupboard door and took out a coat.

3038
02:07:03,530 --> 02:07:04,530
'That man was me!'

3039
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:05,530
Marius cried.

3040
02:07:05,530 --> 02:07:06,530
'And here is the coat I was wearing!'

3041
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:07,530
Thenardier stared at the coat and the cloth
in his hands, speechless with fear.

3042
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,530
He was even more surprised when, instead of
chasing him out of the room, Marius ran towards

3043
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:09,530
him and pressed several thousand-franc notes
into his hand.

3044
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:10,530
'You're a terrible man,' Marius said.

3045
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:11,530
'A thief and a liar.

3046
02:07:11,530 --> 02:07:12,530
You came here to destroy a man, but you have
done the opposite.

3047
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:13,530
If you hadn't saved my father's life at Waterloo,
I'd report you to the police.

3048
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:14,530
I know that your wife is dead, but take the
money and start a new life in America with

3049
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:15,530
your daughter.

3050
02:07:15,530 --> 02:07:16,530
When you arrive there, I'll send you another
20,000 francs.

3051
02:07:16,530 --> 02:07:17,530
Now get out.

3052
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:18,530
I never want to see you again!'

3053
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:19,530
When Thenardier had left, unable to believe
his good fortune, Marius ran to find Cosette

3054
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:20,530
and told her everything immediately.

3055
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:21,530
'We must go to him at once,' Marius said.

3056
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:22,530
'He was the man who saved my life.

3057
02:07:22,530 --> 02:07:23,530
We must waste no time!'

3058
02:07:23,530 --> 02:07:24,530
Minutes later, he and Cosette were travelling
in a carriage to Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

3059
02:07:24,530 --> 02:07:25,530
***

3060
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:26,530
Jean Valjean looked up when he heard the knock
on his door and called in a weak voice, 'Come

3061
02:07:26,530 --> 02:07:27,530
in.'

3062
02:07:27,530 --> 02:07:28,530
The door opened and Marius and Cosette appeared.

3063
02:07:28,530 --> 02:07:29,530
Cosette rushed to the chair where Jean Valjean
was sitting.

3064
02:07:29,530 --> 02:07:30,530
'Father!'

3065
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:31,530
she cried, falling into his arms.

3066
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:32,530
'So you've forgiven me?'

3067
02:07:32,530 --> 02:07:33,530
Valjean whispered, hugging Cosette to him
and turning to Marius.

3068
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:34,530
'Cosette, did you hear what he said?'

3069
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:35,530
Marius cried, tears of shame and guilt rolling
down his cheeks.

3070
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:36,530
'He asked me to forgive him.

3071
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:37,530
And do you know what he did?

3072
02:07:37,530 --> 02:07:38,530
He saved my life and he brought me back to
you.

3073
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:39,530
He came to the barricade to save me, just
as he saved Javert.

3074
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:40,530
He carried me on his back through the sewers
of Paris, to bring me to you.

3075
02:07:40,530 --> 02:07:41,530
Oh Cosette, I feel so ashamed of the way I've
treated him!'

3076
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:42,530
'You have no need to say all this,' Valjean
murmured.

3077
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:43,530
'Why didn't you say it yourself?'

3078
02:07:43,530 --> 02:07:44,530
Marius demanded.

3079
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:45,530
'Why didn't you tell me that you were M. Madeleine
and that you saved Javert's life at the barricade?

3080
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:46,530
Why didn't you tell me that I owed you my
life?'

3081
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:47,530
'Because I thought it would be better to break
away.

3082
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:48,530
If you had known the truth, you would have
felt obliged to be good to me, a worthless

3083
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:49,530
criminal.

3084
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,530
That would have upset everything.'

3085
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:51,530
'What or whom would it have upset?'

3086
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:52,530
Marius said.

3087
02:07:52,530 --> 02:07:53,530
'Well, we're not going to allow you to stay
here on your own.

3088
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:54,530
You're going to come home with us.

3089
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:55,530
You're Cosette's father and mine.

3090
02:07:55,530 --> 02:07:56,530
I won't allow you to spend another day here.'

3091
02:07:56,530 --> 02:07:57,530
'And you can't refuse this time,' Cosette
agreed, sitting on Jean Valjean's lap and

3092
02:07:57,530 --> 02:07:58,530
kissing his forehead.

3093
02:07:58,530 --> 02:07:59,530
'There's a carriage waiting for you.

3094
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:00,530
I'm kidnapping you - by force, if necessary!'

3095
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:01,530
Jean Valjean listened as she described the
view from the room that would be his, the

3096
02:08:01,530 --> 02:08:02,530
beauty of the garden, the singing of the birds,
but he was listening more to the music of

3097
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:03,530
her voice than to the meaning of her words.

3098
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:04,530
Finally, he said, 'Yes, it would be delightful,
but

3099
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:05,530
Cosette, frightened, took his two hands in
hers.

3100
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:06,530
'Your hands are so cold,' she said.

3101
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:07,530
'Are you ill?

3102
02:08:07,530 --> 02:08:08,530
Are you in pain?'

3103
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:09,530
'No,' said Valjean.

3104
02:08:09,530 --> 02:08:10,530
'I'm not in pain.

3105
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:11,530
But

3106
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:12,530
'But what?'

3107
02:08:12,530 --> 02:08:13,530
'I'm going to die soon.'

3108
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:14,530
'Father, no!'

3109
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:15,530
Cosette cried.

3110
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,530
'You're going to live!

3111
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:17,530
You must live, do you understand?'

3112
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,530
Marius and Cosette both did their best to
raise Valjean's spirits, to show him how much

3113
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:19,530
they loved and needed him, to fill him with
the strength and the desire to live again.

3114
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:20,530
But it was too late.

3115
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:21,530
Valjean smiled, his eyes shining with love
and happiness, but he was beginning to lose

3116
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:22,530
strength.

3117
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:23,530
'To die is nothing,' he murmured.

3118
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:24,530
'But it is terrible not to live.'

3119
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:25,530
Then, taking Cosette's sleeve and pressing
it to his lips, he said, 'Come close to me,

3120
02:08:25,530 --> 02:08:26,530
both of you.

3121
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:27,530
I love you dearly.

3122
02:08:27,530 --> 02:08:28,530
How sweet it is to die like this.

3123
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:29,530
And you love me too, dear Cosette.

3124
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:30,530
You'll feel some grief for me, but not too
much.

3125
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:31,530
I want you to have no great sorrows.

3126
02:08:31,530 --> 02:08:32,530
You must enjoy life, my children.

3127
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:33,530
I'm leaving the two candlesticks by the bed
to Cosette.

3128
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:34,530
They're made of silver, but to me they are
pure gold.

3129
02:08:34,530 --> 02:08:35,530
I don't know whether the person who gave them
to me is pleased as he looks down on me from

3130
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:36,530
above.

3131
02:08:36,530 --> 02:08:37,530
I've done my best.

3132
02:08:37,530 --> 02:08:38,530
You mustn't forget, my children, that, despite
my money, I am one of the poor.'

3133
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:39,530
As he spoke, Valjean's breathing became more
painful and he had difficulty moving his arms.

3134
02:08:39,530 --> 02:08:40,530
But as the weakness of his body increased,
his spirit grew in strength.

3135
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:41,530
The light of an unknown world was shining
brightly in his eyes.

3136
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:42,530
'Now, Cosette,' he breathed softly, 'the time
has come for me to tell you your mother's

3137
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:43,530
name.

3138
02:08:43,530 --> 02:08:44,530
It was Fantine.

3139
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:45,530
You must not forget it.

3140
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:46,530
Your mother loved you greatly and she suffered
greatly.

3141
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:47,530
She was as rich in sorrow as you are in happiness.

3142
02:08:47,530 --> 02:08:48,530
That is how God balances things out.

3143
02:08:48,530 --> 02:08:49,530
He watches us all from above and knows what
he is doing among his splendid stars.

3144
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:50,530
And now I must leave you, my children.

3145
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:51,530
Love one another always.

3146
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:52,530
There is nothing else that matters in this
world except love.'

3147
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:53,530
Cosette and Marius fell to their knees on
either side of him, holding back their tears.

3148
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:54,530
Jean Valjean's hands rested on their bowed
heads, and did not move again.

3149
02:08:54,530 --> 02:08:55,530
He lay back with his head turned to the sky,
the light from the two silver candlesticks

3150
02:08:55,530 --> 02:08:56,530
falling on his smiling, peaceful face.

3151
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:56,532
- THE END -
