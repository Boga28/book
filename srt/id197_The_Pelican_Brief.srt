00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,229
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:06,180
Three Bodies

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,339
The man who was waiting on the shore looked
like a farmer. He wore the right kind of clothes,

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,170
and his van, which was parked on the dirt
road above the beach, was suitably covered

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,529
in mud.

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,661
It was midnight on the first Monday in October,
and for the next thirty minutes he had to

7
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:33,020
wait there. He stared out to sea. He was alone,
as he knew he would be; it was planned that

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:41,570
way. This beach was always empty at this time
of night. No cars drove along the dirt road.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,430
The clouds were low and thick. It would be
difficult to see the boat until it was close.

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,559
That was planned as well.

11
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,710
After he had waited twenty minutes he heard
the sound of a quiet engine from the water

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:01,929
and then saw a black rubber boat, low in the
water, approach the shore. The engine stopped

13
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:09,060
when the boat was about thirty feet from the
shore. The farmer looked around. There were

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,940
no people, no cars.

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,320
He carefully put a cigarette in his mouth
and started to smoke it. A man's voice came

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,860
from the boat on the water: 'What kind of
cigarette is that?'

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,040
'Lucky Strike,' the farmer answered.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Satisfied, the man in the boat asked, 'Luke?'

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:42,780
'Sam,' replied the farmer. The man in the
boat was Khamel, not Sam, and Luke knew it.

20
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,150
Luke had often heard of Khamel, but he was
not sure that they had met before. Khamel

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:56,200
had many names and many faces, and he spoke
several languages. He was the most famous

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:04,000
and most feared killer in the world. He was
the best. At first, twenty years ago, he had

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,840
killed for political reasons, but now he would
kill anyone, anywhere, if the money was right.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:19,849
Luke was excited. Khamel was going to be working
in America. He wondered who was going to die.

25
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:26,459
Whoever it was, the killing would be quick
and clean, and there would be no clues.

26
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,900
At dawn, the stolen van stopped at a hotel
in Georgetown, part of Washington, DC, the

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,209
political capital of the United States of
America. Khamel got out of the van without

28
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,709
a word to Luke. They had not spoken throughout
the journey, and Luke had been careful not

29
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,989
to look at Khamel. He didn't want to die;
he didn't want Khamel to think he could recognize

30
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,109
him.

31
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:57,530
The room in the hotel was ready, of course.
The curtains were tightly closed. The car

32
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,980
keys were on the table. The gun was in a briefcase
next to the bed.

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,459
He had received three million dollars already
for this job. He would phone his bank in three

34
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,849
hours to ask whether the next four million
had arrived. While he waited, he practised

35
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,270
his English in front of the mirror. The job
would be over by midnight tonight, so another

36
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,700
three million would reach his bank by midday
tomorrow. By then he would be in Paris. It

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,510
was satisfactory. He allowed himself a short
sleep.

38
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,510
***

39
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,739
The Supreme Court is the highest court in
the USA. It consists of nine judges, who hear

40
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,930
only the most difficult cases in the country
- those cases which might actually threaten

41
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:56,359
the Constitution. Judges are appointed to
the Supreme Court by the government, so a

42
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,829
Republican government will try to get Republican
judges appointed and a Democratic government

43
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:09,739
will try to get Democrats appointed. Judges
become members of the Supreme Court for life.

44
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:18,000
They can retire if they want, but if not the
job ends only with death. Judge Rosenberg

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,170
was so old that he found it hard to stay awake
sometimes, even during trials. He was a liberal,

46
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:33,230
and proud of it. He defended the Indians,
the homosexuals, the poor, the blacks, the

47
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:42,570
Mexicans and the Puerto Ricans. Some people
loved him for it, but more people hated him.

48
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,660
Throughout the summer there had been the usual
number of messages threatening death to the

49
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:54,320
judges of the Supreme Court, and as usual
Rosenberg had received more than the others.

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,940
The FBI had to behave as if the judges really
were in danger, although they were threatened

51
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,980
year after year and it was very rare for anything
to happen. When it did, it was usually a single

52
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,940
madman, whose daughter had died in a road
accident or something. The political groups

53
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:19,040
made a lot of noise, but it was easier for
them to bomb buildings than people, and especially

54
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,310
people who were as well guarded as the Supreme
Court judges.

55
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,900
Rosenberg refused to have FBI guards in his
own home; he had lived to be ninety-one and

56
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,360
was not afraid of death. Judge Jensen had
different reasons for not wanting guards in

57
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,900
his house: he wanted to be able to come and
go as he pleased. Both of them allowed the

58
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,960
guards to wait outside, in cars or on foot,
but they could enter the house only when they

59
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,240
had permission.

60
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,430
A little after ten at night, when the house
was dark and still, the door to a bedroom

61
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:10,420
cupboard opened and Khamel came quietly out.
He was dressed in running clothes. He had

62
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,360
shaved off his beard and coloured his hair
blond.

63
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:22,050
Silently, he went down the stairs. He knew
there were two FBI men in a car that was parked

64
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,540
on the road outside the front of the house;
he knew there was another guard, Ferguson,

65
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,520
walking around the house outside.

66
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,630
Rosenberg and his male nurse were asleep in
the downstairs bedroom. Outside the door,

67
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:46,020
Khamel fitted a silencer on to his gun. He
stepped inside, put the gun to the head of

68
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,590
the nurse and fired three times. The hands
and legs jumped, but the eyes stayed closed,

69
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:01,130
and there was no sound. Khamel quickly reached
across to the grey old head of Judge Rosenberg

70
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,190
and shot three bullets into it.

71
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:11,840
He watched the two bodies for a full minute,
and then went out to the kitchen. He opened

72
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,340
the back door, waited until Ferguson appeared
in the back garden, and then called his name.

73
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,830
He knew that the nurse often invited Ferguson
in for a cup of coffee and something to eat.

74
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,890
Ferguson obediently came into the kitchen.
Khamel fired three bullets into the back of

75
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,300
his head and he fell loudly on to the table.

76
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,560
Khamel left the gun there and went out of
the back door. As soon as he reached the road

77
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,140
at the back of the house, he began running.

78
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,020
He was just another American, out for his
nightly run.

79
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
***

80
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,280
In the dark of the Montrose Theatre, Glenn
Jensen sat by himself and watched the men

81
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,020
on the big screen in the front of the theatre.
He was dressed in ordinary clothes - clothes

82
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:11,300
that no one would remember - and wore dark
glasses too. Nobody would know that he had

83
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:19,140
been here. He came to this homosexual film
theatre once or twice a week, and not even

84
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,620
his FBI guards knew about it.

85
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,780
It was easy to get out of the house. There
were several apartments in the building, and

86
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:34,529
the two FBI men could watch only one entrance
at a time. All he had to do was change his

87
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:41,680
clothes and drive away in a friend's car.
He liked the Montrose because the films went

88
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,870
on all night and there was never a crowd.
Tonight there were only two old men, sitting

89
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,810
together in the middle of the theatre and
holding hands. Jensen watched their backs

90
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:01,620
and wondered if he would be like them in twenty
years. At forty-four, he was the youngest

91
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,810
of the Supreme Court judges.

92
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,580
He was not a favourite of either the Republicans
or the Democrats, but had been a safe appointment

93
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,970
for the Republican President four years ago.
He was not particularly liberal, except in

94
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,810
cases involving homosexuals and those where
industry threatened the environment. He usually

95
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,680
tried to judge his cases according to their
rights and wrongs, rather than any political

96
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
opinions.

97
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,579
A fourth person entered the theatre where
Jensen and the two old men were now enjoying

98
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:44,790
a film in which several young men were in
bed together. He wore tight jeans, a black

99
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:53,629
shirt, an earring, dark glasses and a moustache.
Khamel the homosexual. He smiled when he saw

100
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,790
Jensen there. The information they had given
him was good.

101
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:07,170
At 12:20 the old men left the theatre, arm
in arm. Jensen did not look at them; he was

102
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:16,029
too busy watching the film. Khamel moved like
a cat to a seat behind Jensen. He pulled some

103
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:22,800
rope from round his waist and wrapped the
ends round his hands. He suddenly put the

104
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,879
rope around the front of Jensen's neck and
pulled backwards and downwards. Jensen's neck

105
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,809
broke over the back of his seat. Just to make
sure, Khamel twisted the rope until it bit

106
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:43,410
deeply into Jensen's neck and held it there
for two minutes.

107
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:52,430
An hour later he was waiting at Dulles airport
for his flight to Paris.

108
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,339
CHAPTER TWO
Political Planning

109
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:04,410
The phone woke the President at 4:30 in the
morning. He listened to the voice for a minute

110
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,850
and then jumped out of bed. Eight minutes
later he was in the office. Fletcher Coal,

111
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,639
his chief of staff, was waiting for him.

112
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,319
'What the hell happened?' the President asked.

113
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:27,319
Coal walked up and down in front of the President's
desk. 'We don't know much,' he said. 'They're

114
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:35,740
both dead. Two FBI men found Rosenberg at
one a.m. His nurse and guard were also dead.

115
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:43,550
Three bullets each - very clean, very professional.
While the FBI were at Rosenberg's house, they

116
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:50,259
heard that the police had found Jensen's body
in a homosexual club. Voyles called me, and

117
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,029
I called you. He'll be here in a minute.'

118
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:58,720
'Rosenberg is dead,' the President said.

119
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:07,740
'Yes. At last.' Rosenberg and the Republican
Government had not been friends. 'I suggest

120
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,029
you go on TV in two or three hours' time and
tell the country about it all. Mabry is already

121
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:21,319
working on your speech. We don't want to leave
it until later, because we want to be the

122
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:25,680
first to tell them. The press already have
the news.'

123
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,820
'I didn't know he was a homosexual.'

124
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:37,570
'There's no doubt about it now. This is the
perfect crisis. We didn't cause it; we didn't

125
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,160
do anything wrong. The country will be shocked
and they'll turn to you. You're going to be

126
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,471
more popular than ever, and next year you'll
be elected again for another four years. It's

127
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,471
great.'

128
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:57,019
'And I can get two new men into the Supreme
Court.'

129
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:03,640
'Exactly. That's the best bit. They'll be
your men, and they'll be there for ever. You'll

130
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,139
have a first list of names by tomorrow.'

131
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,050
'Are there any suspects?'

132
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,829
'Not yet.'

133
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:19,610
The President smiled. 'Voyles's FBI men were
supposed to protect the judges, weren't they?

134
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,630
Good. I want you to leak that information
to the press. Maybe we can get rid of Voyles

135
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,019
too.'

136
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:36,240
When Voyles arrived a moment later, the President
and Coal tried to look worried. Voyles told

137
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,329
them that there were no suspects yet, and
the President asked for a list by five o'clock

138
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:48,309
that evening. They agreed that the killings
must be connected. Voyles denied that his

139
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,720
men had been careless.

140
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,220
'Rosenberg and Jensen are dead because they
refused to let us guard them properly,' he

141
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,819
said. 'We're guarding the other seven, and
they're still alive.'

142
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:10,339
'At the moment,' the President said, and looked
at Coal. They almost smiled. They could easily

143
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:17,660
make Voyles look stupid and inefficient over
this business. Voyles knew it too. He was

144
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,830
going to have to be careful. The President
- or rather Coal, who told the President what

145
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:31,629
to think - wanted his head, and the press
would eat him alive. Back in his office, he

146
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:36,760
ordered a full enquiry into the murders.

147
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
***

148
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,269
Darby Shaw woke up a little before dawn. After
fifteen months of law school at Tulane University

149
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:51,009
in New Orleans, her mind refused to rest for
more than six hours. The work had not been

150
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:57,610
so hard at her first university, in Phoenix,
Arizona, where she had specialized in environmental

151
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,050
science. Then she decided to become a lawyer
and to defend the environment in the courts.

152
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:10,040
The price was hard work and more hard work.

153
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,899
There were some rewards, however. She turned
over in the bed to look at the man sleeping

154
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:22,920
next to her. Thomas Callahan was one of the
most popular teachers in the university. He

155
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,660
was forty-five years old, but seemed a lot
younger. He drank a lot, wore jeans, drove

156
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:36,709
a Porsche, lived in the French Quarter and
managed to make even constitutional law interesting.

157
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:43,220
He was also good in bed. And for the first
time in his life he had stayed with one woman

158
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,889
for more than a few weeks. Darby and he had
been together now for several months. She

159
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:57,509
smiled and wondered what her fellow students
would think. Only her very best friends knew

160
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:00,199
the secret.

161
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:06,489
She turned the TV on and suddenly there was
the President. She listened for a minute and

162
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:16,639
then shook Thomas awake. 'Thomas! Wake up!
Listen to this!' She turned the sound up louder.

163
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,740
Callahan sat up and stared at the screen,
still half asleep. He understood what the

164
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:32,369
President was saying, though. 'Rosenberg?
Murdered?' he said. Darby knew that Rosenberg

165
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:33,939
was his hero.

166
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:37,600
'Jensen too,' she said.

167
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,529
The President finished his speech and Darby
switched the TV off.

168
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:46,949
'No suspects, according to the President,'
Callahan said.

169
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:52,999
'I can think of at least twenty groups who
wanted Rosenberg dead,' Darby said, 'starting

170
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,410
with the Ku-Klux-Klan.'

171
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:04,079
'Yeah, but why those two judges? OK, lots
of people wanted Rosenberg dead, but why Jensen?

172
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,949
Why not McDowell or Yount? They're both more
liberal than Jensen.'

173
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,230
'Maybe they both just got killed on the same
night by chance,'

174
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,549
Darby suggested, without believing it.

175
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:23,329
'No, I don't think so,' said Callahan. 'These
are the first Supreme Court judges ever to

176
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,600
be murdered - and then two in one night? There
must be some connection between the murders.

177
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,250
But you know the worst thing? That fool President
will be able to fill their places. That means

178
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,840
that eight out of the nine will be Republicans.
We won't be able to recognize the Constitution

179
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,169
in ten years. This is awful.'

180
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:53,570
'Perhaps that's why they were killed, Thomas.
Someone or some group wants a different Supreme

181
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,820
Court, filled with Republicans.'

182
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,490
'But why Jensen? He was appointed by a Republican.'

183
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,950
'I don't know, but there must be some connection.
Maybe there's a clue in the cases the Supreme

184
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,420
Court was due to hear this year. The library
will have that information. I think I'll spend

185
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,799
some time on this today.'

186
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,690
CHAPTER THREE
No Clues

187
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:31,950
Denton Voyles put Eric East in charge of the
case. On Thursday, East reported back to Voyles

188
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:38,909
with a list of their top suspects. There were
a number of political groups - especially

189
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:46,679
the Underground Army, the Ku-Klux-Klan and
the White Defenders - but also some individuals

190
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,130
who were rich enough to afford the kind of
professional killer who had obviously done

191
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:59,419
this job. There was Nelson Muncie, who had
lost his daughter in a sex killing in Florida;

192
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:04,890
the police had caught the man, who was black,
but thanks to Rosenberg the man had walked

193
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:13,390
free. There was Clinton Lane, whose son was
a homosexual who had died of Aids. The problem

194
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,440
with all these suspects, however, was that
the killings were so professional and clean

195
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,539
that there were no clues except for the gun
and the rope. There were not even any clues

196
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:31,279
about how the killer had entered Rosenberg's
house. Still, Voyles and he agreed to have

197
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:37,309
between five and twenty men investigate each
suspect or group of suspects.

198
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:44,700
In the law library and on the computers of
Tulane University, Darby Shaw was gathering

199
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,600
pages and pages of information.

200
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,690
What was the connection between Rosenberg
and Jensen? She could see reasons for killing

201
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:04,280
one or the other, but not both together. But
there had to be a single reason.

202
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
***

203
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,200
Thomas Callahan slept late and alone. Darby
had been too busy to see him since Wednesday.

204
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,210
Now it was Friday morning. He made some coffee
and, as he drank it, watched the busy French

205
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,780
Quarter through his window.

206
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:28,830
What was it he had to do? Oh, yes, phone Gavin.
On Monday he was going to Washington for a

207
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:35,710
conference about constitutional law. He and
his old friend Gavin Verheek were going to

208
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:43,250
meet and get drunk together on Monday evening.
Gavin had been a friend ever since law school.

209
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,960
He and Callahan were the only two in their
year who refused to go into private practice

210
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:56,669
and get rich. While Callahan had become a
teacher, Verheek had joined the FBI as a legal

211
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:57,669
adviser.

212
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:04,059
When Verheek came on the phone, he said, 'Thomas,
how are you?'

213
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,660
'It's ten-thirty. I'm not dressed. I'm sitting
here in the French Quarter drinking coffee

214
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,880
and watching the world outside. What are you
doing?'

215
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,769
'Well, here it's eleven-thirty, and I haven't
left the office since they found the bodies

216
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,049
on Wednesday morning.'

217
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:28,520
'It makes me sick, Gavin. The President will
get two Nazis on to the Supreme Court. I suppose

218
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,730
you've already seen the list. I bet your office
is already checking that they've lived good,

219
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:43,070
clean lives. Go on, Gavin, tell me who's on
the list. I won't tell anyone else.'

220
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:49,400
'No chance. I'll only tell you this: your
name's not on the list'

221
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,260
'I'm so disappointed.'

222
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,070
'How's the girl?'

223
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,630
'Which one?'

224
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,169
'Come on, Thomas. The girl?'

225
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:07,360
'She's beautiful and brilliant and gentle.
Oh, and rich. She has red hair and the longest

226
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,580
legs you've ever seen.'

227
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,240
'Wow! What's her name?'

228
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,940
'Darby Shaw. But I haven't seen her for a
couple of days. She's trying to solve the

229
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,809
murders all by herself. Why don't you tell
me who did it, and then I can tell her and

230
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,529
she'll come back to me?'

231
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:33,350
'Don't you read the papers? We have no suspects.
Not one.'

232
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,299
'At least I tried. Are we going to meet on
Monday?'

233
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:44,150
'I hope so. Voyles wants us to work day and
night until the computers tell us who did

234
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,240
it.'

235
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,019
'I'll expect a full report on Monday, Gavin
- not just the gossip.'

236
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:56,730
'Why don't you bring Darby? How old is she?
Nineteen?'

237
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,029
'Twenty-four, and she's not invited. I'll
see you on Monday at seven p.m., in the usual

238
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:05,269
restaurant. OK?'

239
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:09,679
'OK. See you.'

240
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,679
***

241
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,519
Darby's enquiries had brought her to the court
in Lafayette. Of all the Supreme Court cases

242
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,520
due to be heard in the next few months, there
was one that could explain the killings. She

243
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,620
needed to see the court's files on the case.
When the clerk brought them to her table,

244
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:36,930
however, her heart sank. There were lots of
files, each inches thick. The case was seven

245
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:43,370
years old. Only one person was involved, but
he had hidden behind thirty-eight different

246
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:50,480
businesses, which had used no fewer than fifteen
law firms over the last seven years.

247
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:58,230
She pulled her chair in to the table and began
to work.

248
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:04,470
CHAPTER FOUR
Ideas and Information

249
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,910
The meeting East and Voyles had with Coal
and the President did not go well. Not only

250
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,620
could they not report any progress, but they
had to admit that investigations like this

251
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:22,740
could take many months. Then Coal handed Voyles
a list of eight possible members of the Supreme

252
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,960
Court, two of whom would fill the places left
empty by Rosenberg and Jensen. 'We want a

253
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,500
report on these people in ten days, Voyles,'
he said, 'and make sure the press doesn't

254
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,659
get to hear about them.'

255
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:46,759
'You know we can't promise that,' Voyles said.
'We can't guarantee no leaks. As soon as we

256
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,930
start to dig around these people, someone
will realize what's going on.'

257
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:59,750
'The FBI can't guarantee secrecy?' Coal said.
'You'd better keep this out of the papers,

258
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,080
Voyles.'

259
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:08,440
Voyles jumped out of his chair. 'Listen, Coal,'
he shouted. 'Why don't you investigate these

260
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,309
people yourself? Don't start telling me what
to do.'

261
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:20,500
The President tried to make peace. 'All we're
saying is do your best, Voyles,' he said.

262
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:27,559
'These people are young and they're good Republicans.
They'll be giving the Constitution shape long

263
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:33,460
after I'm dead. So it's important to me that
the two who become members of the Supreme

264
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:40,629
Court are clean, so that they can stay there
for ever. So no drugs, no unusual sexual habits

265
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:43,840
- nothing like that. OK?'

266
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,720
'Yes, Mr President. But we cannot guarantee
total secrecy.'

267
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,710
'I understand. Just try your best.'

268
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,340
'Yes, sir.'

269
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
***

270
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,679
Callahan went round to Darby's apartment with
a pizza and a bottle of wine. He hadn't seen

271
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,909
her for four days. He rang on her doorbell.

272
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:11,740
'Who is it?' she called through the door.

273
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,200
'Thomas Callahan,' he said. 'Do you remember
me?'

274
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,929
The door opened and Callahan stepped in. 'Are
we still friends?' he asked, and gave her

275
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:26,200
a kiss.

276
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,840
'Of course. I've just been busy.'

277
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,370
'So what did the great detective find?'

278
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:38,570
She was opening the bottle of wine and didn't
answer straight away. She poured wine into

279
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:44,799
two glasses and they went and sat together
on the sofa. She put her legs up on to him,

280
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,659
and he stroked them. He repeated the question.

281
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:55,559
'Nothing, really. I was following a path,
and it took me somewhere. I even typed it

282
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,909
up as a brief, but I don't think it's worth
anything.'

283
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,710
'What? You've been running around playing
detective for four days, and refusing to see

284
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,259
me, and now you're just going to throw it
away?'

285
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,159
'It's over there on the table, if you want
to see it,' she said.

286
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:21,990
'I don't want to see it now,' he said. 'We
have more important things to do. I'm going

287
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:28,580
to be away in Washington for a few days, remember?
I'll read your brief and then we'll talk about

288
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:34,299
it. But not till we've been to bed, OK?'

289
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,700
She pulled him towards her and they kissed
long and hard.

290
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
***

291
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:46,820
There was a cleaner in the White House whom
everyone called Sarge. He was old, very black,

292
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,659
and had white hair. He wore dark glasses all
the time, and everyone thought that he was

293
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,760
half blind.

294
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:03,140
In fact, Sarge could see very well. He could
see round corners. He had been working in

295
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:11,570
the White House for thirty years now, cleaning
and listening, cleaning and seeing. He knew

296
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:18,990
which doors stayed open and which walls were
thin. No one ever noticed him.

297
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:27,000
His son Cleve was a policeman. This is how
it worked: Cleve would contact Gray Grantham

298
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,509
of the Washington Post and arrange a meeting.
Sarge and Grantham would meet. No one knew

299
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:42,650
how Grantham got his political information,
but it was always good and always correct.

300
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:48,470
Sarge never talked to anyone except Grantham,
and he didn't tell even him everything he

301
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,840
found out.

302
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:58,340
This time they met at Glenda's, a little cafe
on Fourteenth Street. Sarge was able to tell

303
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:06,890
Grantham two of the people on the list of
possible Supreme Court judges.

304
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,480
CHAPTER FIVE
An Implausible Theory

305
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,460
Verheek had drunk too much the night before
with Callahan, as he had known he would. What

306
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:26,230
had he said? Had he given away any secrets?
He remembered explaining that the connection

307
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:32,960
between Rosenberg and Jensen was not political.
The connection was so obvious that for several

308
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,139
days no one in the FBI had seen it.

309
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:42,590
They were killed because the killer could
get to them. It was as simple as that. They

310
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,419
weren't guarded as well as the others. Of
course this still didn't answer the question

311
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,399
why someone wanted two Supreme Court judges
dead.

312
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,480
He remembered that they spent most of the
evening talking about their student days together

313
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,669
in Washington, and about women. Callahan had
given him a copy of the brief his girl-friend

314
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:12,809
- what was her name? Darby - had written about
the death of the two judges. Callahan had

315
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:20,720
said it was an interesting theory. She didn't
believe it, nor did he, but it was worth reading.

316
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,220
Verheek pulled the brief out of his briefcase
now and started to read it. It was better

317
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,620
written than most briefs, and he enjoyed it.
The theory was implausible, but no one else

318
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:42,539
had thought of it. It was worth considering.
He would show it to Eric East.

319
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,539
***

320
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:50,409
The phone went four times, the answering machine
came on, but the caller left no message. The

321
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:57,610
phone went again, and the same thing happened
again. The third time Grantham climbed out

322
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:03,519
of bed and answered the phone. It was still
dark. 'Yes?'

323
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:10,080
'Is that Gray Grantham, of the Washington
Post?'

324
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,360
'It is. Who's calling?'

325
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,490
'I can't give you my name.'

326
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,970
'OK. Why are you calling?'

327
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:26,429
'I saw your story yesterday about the White
House and the possible next two Supreme Court

328
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:28,200
judges.'

329
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,889
'Good. But why are you calling me so early
in the morning?'

330
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:41,899
'I'm sorry. I'm in a pay phone. I'm on my
way to work. I can't call from home or the

331
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,769
office.'

332
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,749
'What kind of office?'

333
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:48,749
'I'm a lawyer.'

334
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:55,749
Great. Washington was home to half a million
lawyers. 'Private or government?'

335
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:59,080
'I'd rather not say.'

336
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,049
'OK. Anyway, why did you call?'

337
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:09,890
A hesitation. 'I may know something about
Rosenberg and Jensen.'

338
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,610
Grantham sat up straight. 'What, exactly?'

339
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,590
'Are you recording this?'

340
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,759
'No. Should I?'

341
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:27,230
'I don't know, Mr Grantham. I'd prefer it
if you didn't record this. OK?'

342
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,749
'Whatever you want. I'm listening.'

343
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,620
'Can you trace this call?'

344
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,169
'I could. But you're at a pay phone - what
difference would it make?'

345
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:46,059
'You're right. I'm just frightened. You see,
I think I know who killed them.'

346
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:51,049
Now Grantham was standing. 'That's valuable
information.'

347
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:57,120
'It could get me killed. Do you think they're
following me?'

348
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,330
'Who? Don't worry. Tell me your name.'

349
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,289
'You can call me Garcia.'

350
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:05,759
'That's not your real name, is it?

351
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,630
'Of course not, but it's the best I can do.'

352
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,370
'OK, Garcia, talk to me.'

353
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,769
'I'm not certain, you understand. But I think
I accidentally saw something at the office

354
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:21,659
that I was not supposed to see.'

355
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,350
'Do you have a copy of it?'

356
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,350
'Maybe.'

357
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,730
'Do you want to talk or not?'

358
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,700
'I don't know. What will you do if I tell
you something?'

359
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,919
'First try to find out whether it's true.
We won't print the names of the killers of

360
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:46,809
two Supreme Court judges in a hurry, believe
me.' There was a very long silence. 'Garcia,

361
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,049
are you still there?'

362
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:54,700
'Yes. I need to think about this. I might
call you later.'

363
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,010
'OK, if that's what you want.'

364
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,860
'Sorry I woke you up.'

365
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:07,179
The phone went dead. Grantham pushed seven
numbers on his phone, waited, and then pushed

366
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:14,609
six more. Another wait, and then four more.
The small screen on his phone showed him a

367
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:26,250
row of numbers. He wrote them down on a piece
of paper. The pay phone was on Fifteenth Street.

368
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,250
***

369
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,690
East and K. O. Lewis, Voyles's second-in-command,
met with Coal alone, because the President

370
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:39,560
was out of Washington. They had two bits of
information for him. First, they told him

371
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:47,710
that cameras at the airport in Paris had recorded
the arrival from Dulles of the killer Khamel.

372
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,960
Coal thought about this for a minute. 'What
if Khamel was involved in the killings? What

373
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,400
does it mean?'

374
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:03,160
'It means we'll never find him,' Lewis replied.
'Nine countries around the world have failed

375
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,160
to find him for the last twenty years. It
means that he was paid a lot of money by someone

376
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,369
or some people here to do the killings.'

377
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:20,069
'So we know or we think that Khamel did the
killings, but it doesn't really help us, does

378
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:21,069
it?'

379
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:23,080
No, you're right.'

380
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,400
'OK. What else have you got for me?'

381
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,680
Lewis looked at East. 'There's no real progress
to report, except.

382
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,920
'Except what?'

383
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,590
'Well, there's this theory which has appeared
in the last twenty- four hours. A law student

384
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:50,510
in New Orleans wrote it up as a brief. We
call it the Pelican Brief. Here's a copy of

385
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,750
it. Voyles liked it, but he was afraid it
could hurt the President.'

386
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,110
'How?'

387
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:02,550
'Read it. You'll see.'

388
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,550
***

389
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:09,320
This time Garcia called Grantham during office
hours. He didn't tell him anything new. He

390
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,960
was still frightened and uncertain.

391
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,079
They agreed that he would call again at lunch-time
the next day. The call came from a pay phone

392
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,910
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

393
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,910
***

394
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:30,710
Later, when the President returned, Coal told
him about the brief. 'The theory is implausible,'

395
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:37,050
he said. 'But Voyles likes it. He probably
doesn't believe the theory any more than anyone

396
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:44,010
else, but we've made him look bad over these
killings so far and he wants revenge. He's

397
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:50,360
going to investigate this new suspect. If
the press get to hear about the investigation,

398
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,690
that could be bad for you. We'd better do
something about it.'

399
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,599
'Is the suspect someone we know?'

400
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,650
'Yes.' Coal explained what was in the brief.

401
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,630
'Did we get a lot of money from him?'

402
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:14,600
'Millions, one way or another,' said Coal.
But the President preferred not to know the

403
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:25,660
various ways in which money came in, especially
when they weren't always perfectly legal.

404
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,559
CHAPTER SIX
Hunted!

405
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:37,309
Thomas was drinking too much over dinner.
She didn't like it, and she told him so. He

406
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:43,980
wanted to prove that she was wrong, so he
drank even more. They had an argument.

407
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,940
After dinner, outside the restaurant, he pulled
the keys to his Porsche out of his pocket.

408
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:56,369
'Thomas, no! You're too drunk to drive. Give
me the keys.'

409
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:01,460
He held on to the keys and set off in the
direction of the car park. He couldn't walk

410
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,550
straight and his foot kept slipping off the
pavement into the road. She followed him,

411
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:14,119
but stayed some way behind; she was too angry,
and just wanted to get back to her apartment

412
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,300
alone. He shouted something over his shoulder
about how he could drive better when he was

413
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,180
drunk.

414
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,290
She stood with her arms crossed on the other
side of the car park and watched him put the

415
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:35,680
key into the lock. It took him three or four
attempts. Then he was inside and she lost

416
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,400
sight of him between two other cars. She heard
him start the engine, though.

417
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,920
The explosion knocked her to the ground. She
lay there for a moment, and then jumped to

418
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,900
her feet. The Porsche was a ball of fire.

419
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,580
Darby ran towards it, screaming his name.
Bits of the car were still falling all around

420
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:06,349
her, and the heat stopped her thirty feet
away. She screamed with her hands over her

421
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,349
mouth.

422
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:13,460
A second explosion tore through the car and
pushed her back. She fell and her head hit

423
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,210
the side of a parked car hard. Everything
went blank for a minute.

424
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,839
Then there were people everywhere, and voices
shouting:

425
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,990
'Whose car is it? Call 911! Was there anyone
in it?'

426
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:35,180
She was repeating the name Thomas. Someone
put a cold cloth on her head. She heard the

427
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:42,210
sound of the police and firemen coming, and
then there were red and blue lights everywhere.

428
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:49,740
A black man was bending over her. 'Are you
all right, miss?' he asked.

429
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,609
'Thomas,' she said. 'Where's Thomas?'

430
00:39:54,609 --> 00:40:00,570
'Miss, who's Thomas?' asked the man. 'Was
he in that car?'

431
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:06,931
She nodded and then closed her eyes. She could
hear men shouting in the distance. They were

432
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:14,540
all over by the burning car. She sat up and
was sick between her legs. Then she felt better.

433
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:25,480
She got up and walked away. She knew who the
bomb had been for: her. And she knew why.

434
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,810
She had to hide; they were hunting her. Were
they behind her even now? She wandered deep

435
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:38,480
into the French Quarter, found a cheap hotel
and paid for a room with her card. As soon

436
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,490
as she was in the room, she locked the door
and curled up on the bed with all the lights

437
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,060
on.

438
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,060
***

439
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,369
Mrs Verheek answered the bedside phone. 'It's
for you, Gavin,' she called into the bathroom,

440
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,569
where he was shaving.

441
00:40:54,569 --> 00:41:00,660
He came and took the phone from her. 'Hello,'
he said angrily. Who could be calling this

442
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,330
early in the morning?

443
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:06,799
'This is Darby Shaw. Do you know the name?'

444
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:10,349
'Yes. We share a friend.'

445
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:13,079
'Did you read the little theory I wrote?'

446
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,990
'Yes, the Pelican Brief, as we call it.'

447
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,760
'And who is "we"?'

448
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,510
Verheek sat up straight. She was not calling
for a friendly chat. 'Why are you calling,

449
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,510
Darby?'

450
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,930
'I need some answers, Mr Verheek. I'm frightened
to death.'

451
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,250
'It's Gavin, OK?'

452
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,760
'OK, Gavin. Where's the brief?'

453
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,220
'Why? What's wrong?'

454
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,030
'I'll tell you in a minute. Just tell me what
you did with the brief.'

455
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,450
'Well, I read it, and then I passed it on
to someone else, who passed it on to Denton

456
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,890
Voyles, who liked it.'

457
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,079
'Has anyone outside the FBI seen it?'

458
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,380
'I can't answer that.'

459
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,579
'Then I won't tell you what's happened to
Thomas.'

460
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:10,140
'All right. Yes, it's been outside the FBI,
but I don't know exactly where and I don't

461
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,390
know how many people have read it.'

462
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:22,680
'He's dead, Gavin. He was murdered last night.
Someone put a bomb in the car. I was lucky.'

463
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,589
Gavin was shocked. 'Where are you? Are you
safe?'

464
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:33,970
'New Orleans. Who knows if I'm safe? They
must be after me too. It was me they really

465
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,950
wanted.'

466
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,880
'I'll have some men come and get you, Darby.
You can't stay on the streets. Then I'll catch

467
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,750
a plane and I'll be there by midday.'

468
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,630
'I don't think so. Thomas is dead because
he talked to you. Why should I want to talk

469
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:55,119
to you? Give me your number at work. I may
call you later.'

470
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,430
'OK. But Darby, just tell me: did he feel
any pain?'

471
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:10,810
There were tears in her voice. 'No, it was
very quick.' Then she put the phone down.

472
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:19,440
She could let herself cry now, because there
wouldn't be time later. Crying could get her

473
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,810
killed.

474
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:26,480
CHAPTER SEVEN
Keep Moving

475
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,290
It was nearly time for the President's daily
meeting with Voyles. By now he was tired of

476
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:39,190
the whole business; he just wanted to get
his men into the Supreme Court. Coal was telling

477
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:46,380
him something, but he wasn't really listening.
Voyles and Coal hated each other so much now

478
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:53,660
that Coal had to leave the office whenever
Voyles came. They had nearly fought last time.

479
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:59,230
It didn't matter to Coal whether he was in
or out of the office; there were enough hidden

480
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:05,280
microphones and cameras for him to listen
and watch any conversation there.

481
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,059
The President felt better knowing that Coal
was at least watching. He greeted Voyles warmly

482
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:19,030
at the door and led him over to the sofa for
a friendly chat. Voyles was not impressed.

483
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:27,510
'Denton,' the President said, 'I want to apologize
for Coal's be-haviour last time.'

484
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:33,670
'He can be stupid, can't he?' Voyles said,
knowing that Coal was listening.

485
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:42,590
'Yes. He's very clever, and works amazingly
hard, but he goes too far sometimes. Anyway,

486
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:49,549
that's all behind us now. I want you to tell
me all about this Pelican Brief. How seriously

487
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:52,470
are you taking it?'

488
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:58,700
Voyles tried not to smile. This was great
- he had managed to get Coal and the President

489
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:06,559
worried. 'We are investigating all suspects,
Mr President,' he replied. 'We have fourteen

490
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,369
men on this one.'

491
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:15,680
'I don't have to tell you, Denton,' the President
continued, 'how much damage this theory could

492
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,290
do if the press heard about it.'

493
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,420
'We won't tell the press, Mr President.'

494
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:28,710
'I know. All I'm saying is that I want you
to pull back from this one. The theory is

495
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:35,970
crazy anyway, and I could really get hurt.
Do you understand what I'm saying?'

496
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:41,450
'Are you asking me not to investigate a suspect,
Mr President?'

497
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,309
'I'm just saying that you must have better
things to do with your men. The press is watching

498
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:55,930
this investigation closely. You know how they
are - they don't like me at all. So why don't

499
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,590
you leave this one alone and chase the real
suspects?'

500
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,700
'Is that what you're asking me to do?'

501
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:10,319
'I'm not asking you, Denton; I'm telling you
to leave it alone for a couple of weeks. If

502
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:18,099
you need to go back to it later, of course
you must. But I'm still the boss around here,

503
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:20,319
remember?' ***

504
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,540
Gavin stayed near Voyles's office until the
secretary let him in. He couldn't believe

505
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:31,520
it when Voyles and Lewis told him that they
were no longer investigating the Pelican theory.

506
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:40,100
'My best friend is dead because of that brief,'
he said. 'He was killed by a car bomb. Someone

507
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,670
is worried about the brief, don't you think?'

508
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,670
'The brief has already been very valuable
to us, Gavin,' Lewis said.

509
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:54,901
'Yeah, it let you play some games with the
White House,' Gavin said bitterly. 'But there's

510
00:46:54,901 --> 00:47:01,940
a girl out there running for her life. What
am I going to tell her?' ***

511
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,799
Darby made sure she could not be followed
in the crowds in the shopping district. She

512
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:12,960
bought some new clothes and hid her hair under
a hat. She went into the Sheraton Hotel and

513
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,350
found a row of pay phones. First she called
Mrs Chen, who lived in the apartment next

514
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:27,470
to hers: no, she had not seen anything; yes,
there had been a knock at her door early this

515
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,220
morning. Then she called Gavin.

516
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,829
'Where are you?' he asked.

517
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:41,920
'Let me explain something. For now, I'm not
going to tell you or anyone else where I am.

518
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
Clear?'

519
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,089
'Yes, but don't go home.'

520
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:51,730
'I'm not a fool. They've already been there.
What did Mr Voyles say?'

521
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,190
'I haven't been able to see him.'

522
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:00,760
'You've been at the office for four hours,
Gavin. I expected you to do better.'

523
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,619
'Be patient, Darby.'

524
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:08,710
'Patience will get me killed. I've got to
keep moving.'

525
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:15,100
She saw a face. He walked among the tourists
at the hotel's front desk. He was trying to

526
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:21,810
look as though he belonged here, but his eyes
were searching. The face was long and thin,

527
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:26,440
and he wore round glasses. He was a little
over six feet tall.

528
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:34,089
'Gavin, listen to me,' she said. 'I have to
go. I can see a man I've seen before, about

529
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:35,240
an hour ago.'

530
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,480
'OK. Take care, Darby, and call me again soon.'

531
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,359
'I'll try.'

532
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,829
CHAPTER EIGHT
Photos and Phone Calls

533
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:56,720
The photographer's name was Croft. He was
parked on Pennsylvania Avenue in Grantham's

534
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:03,619
Volvo, because it had a phone. The pay phone
was easy to see, about fifty yards in front

535
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:11,369
of the car. With his powerful camera he could
almost read the names in the phone book. A

536
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:13,730
large woman was using the phone at the moment.

537
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:21,250
At 12:20 the woman put the phone down and
walked away. From nowhere a young man in a

538
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:29,040
suit appeared and walked over to the phone.
Croft felt sure that this was the man. He

539
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,200
picked up his camera and looked through it.
The man was pushing numbers on the phone and

540
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:42,250
looked nervous. He kept looking this way and
that. Croft took a couple of pictures.

541
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:48,960
The phone in the car went three times. Croft
didn't pick it up. It was Grantham at the

542
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:57,599
office, signalling that this was their man.
Croft used a whole film on the first camera.

543
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,119
When the man had finished talking on the phone,
he walked straight towards the Volvo along

544
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:09,559
the pavement. Beautiful. Croft took several
more pictures with a second camera and stopped

545
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:18,080
well before the man could possibly see inside
the car. An easy job.

546
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
***

547
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,809
Grantham got plenty of excellent pictures
from Croft. Garcia didn't look Spanish, despite

548
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:30,940
the name he had chosen. He looked like thousands
of other young lawyers up and down the country.

549
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:37,470
From Garcia he got nothing. It didn't matter.
He let him talk about his wife and child,

550
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:45,460
and how frightened he was. One day, and one
day soon, Garcia would give him the information,

551
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,079
whatever it was.

552
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,890
From Sarge he got a copy of a White House
document naming Khamel as the probable killer

553
00:50:53,890 --> 00:51:00,491
of Rosenberg and Jensen. This was good. There
was little in the office files about Khamel,

554
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:07,050
and only two pictures, which looked like two
different people, but he wrote it up into

555
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:15,430
a story and they decided to use both pictures
and the story on the front page the next day.

556
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,430
***

557
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:21,039
The phone was going. After twenty-four hours
on the run, she had drunk a bottle of wine

558
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:27,859
the night before and fallen asleep on her
bed in the Marriott Hotel. But first she had

559
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:34,040
cut off her long red hair and coloured it
black; they would be expecting blonde. They

560
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:40,609
would also be expecting her to run away, so
despite her fears she stayed in New Orleans.

561
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:47,050
They would be watching all the police stations,
so she had stayed away from them.

562
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:54,869
The phone was still going. She picked it up
and heard 'Darby? This is Gavin.'

563
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:58,560
Now she was awake. 'How did you find me?'

564
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,619
'We are the FBI. We have our ways.'

565
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:10,940
'Wait. Let me think. Of course, you can trace
me when I use my cards to pay for things.

566
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:17,521
How stupid of me! But if you can find me,
they can find me too. They could be outside

567
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:19,660
the door now.'

568
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:28,470
'Stay in small hotels, then, and pay with
cash. Now, listen. I'm coming to New Orleans;

569
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,630
it's Thomas's funeral tomorrow.

570
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,579
'I think we should meet tonight. You have
to trust me, Darby.'

571
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:37,630
'What did Voyles say?'

572
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:42,270
Gavin hesitated. 'We're taking no action at
this time.'

573
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,640
'That's lawyer talk, Gavin. What does it mean?'

574
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,710
'I don't want to talk on the phone. That's
why we have to meet.'

575
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:56,230
'No. Tell me why Voyles is doing nothing about
this.'

576
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,809
'I'm not sure why. Honestly.'

577
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:04,990
'What do you think, Gavin? Do you think Thomas
was killed because of the brief?

578
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,250
'Yes.'

579
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:13,150
'Thanks. If Thomas was murdered because of
the brief, then we know who killed him. And

580
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:19,960
if we know who killed Thomas, then we know
who killed Rosenberg and Jensen. Am I right?'

581
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,960
'Probably.'

582
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:28,420
'That's good enough - "probably" means "yes"
when a lawyer says it. But the FBI is still

583
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,910
doing nothing about my suspect.'

584
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:39,079
'Calm down, Darby. Let's meet tonight and
talk about this. I could save your life.'

585
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:43,650
She carefully put the receiver of the phone
under the pillow. She threw her things into

586
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:49,780
a bag and left the room. She walked up two
floors to the seventeenth, then took the lift

587
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:56,340
down to the tenth. Then she walked down the
stairs to the ground floor. She hid in the

588
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,200
women's room for half an hour, and then left
the hotel.

589
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:07,010
On Dumaine Street, in the French Quarter,
she found an empty cafe with a phone at the

590
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,180
back. She called Verheek.

591
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:15,289
'Where will you stay tonight?' she asked him.

592
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:17,470
'At the Hilton.'

593
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:21,940
'I'll call late tonight or early in the morning.'

594
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,800
'Can you get the Washington Post down there?
You should read it today.'

595
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,910
'I can't wait. I'll speak to you later.'

596
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:38,420
She bought a Post and read it at another cafe.
If the report was right, it fitted in with

597
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:44,950
her theory. The local paper had a picture
of Thomas on the second page, with a long

598
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:51,380
story about the explosion. The police were
looking for a white female whom several witnesses

599
00:54:51,380 --> 00:55:00,440
had seen there at the time. She looked slowly
at the photo of Thomas. He was so handsome.

600
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,589
Tears filled her eyes.

601
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:03,589
***

602
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:09,720
Alice Stark, Darby's best friend, got the
key to the apartment from Mrs Chen and let

603
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,829
herself in. She had been there plenty of times
before, and everything looked all right. Nothing

604
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:23,609
was out of place; the whole apartment was
tidy. The kitchen smelled of stale food.

605
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:28,569
It was dark when she got there, but Darby
had told her not to switch on the lights,

606
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:35,690
and certainly not to open the curtains. She
used a torch to see her way around.

607
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:41,579
She sat down at the computer and turned it
on. She looked for the files Darby had mentioned,

608
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:49,700
but they weren't there. By the light of the
torch she looked in the boxes of diskettes;

609
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,260
they were empty.

610
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:58,930
Alice returned the key to Mrs Chen and walked
half a mile to where she had left her car.

611
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:05,319
She met Darby as arranged in the restaurant,
and she told her what she had discovered.

612
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:12,549
Darby did not seem surprised, and refused
to answer Alice's questions.

613
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:13,549
***

614
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:20,230
Verheek was angry. She had said she would
call him. Now it was midnight and she still

615
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:28,569
hadn't called. He could save her life if she
called. He had to do something. He decided

616
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:35,420
to visit a few student bars to find out if
anyone knew her and had seen her recently.

617
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:42,829
He got back to his room at three in the morning.
There were no messages. She hadn't called.

618
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:48,020
Was she still alive?

619
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,740
CHAPTER NINE
Searching for Darby

620
00:56:51,740 --> 00:57:00,190
Another phone call from Garcia. The man still
wouldn't talk. Why was he calling him before

621
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:07,069
dawn on a Saturday? They'd had the same conversation
every time - that he had to think about the

622
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:12,859
safety of his wife and child, that he had
seen something in his office - but there was

623
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:16,190
never anything new.

624
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:20,710
Grantham had just gone back to sleep when
the phone went again.

625
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:29,130
'Hello?' It was not Garcia this time; it was
a female voice. 'Is this Gray Grantham of

626
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:34,230
the Washington Post? He must get an unlisted
telephone number.

627
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:37,750
'It is. And who are you?'

628
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,890
'Are you still on the story about Rosenberg
and Jensen?'

629
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,890
'Yes.'

630
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,569
'Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?'

631
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:49,880
'The Pelican Brief. No. What is it?'

632
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:56,260
'It contains a theory about who killed the
judges. It was given to the FBI last Monday

633
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:02,619
by a man called Thomas Callahan. Suddenly,
on Wednesday, Callahan is killed by a car

634
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:03,619
bomb.'

635
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:06,020
'How do you know all this?'

636
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,430
'I wrote the brief.'

637
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:14,109
He was wide awake now, listening hard. 'Where
are you?'

638
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:15,390
'New Orleans.'

639
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,079
'Are you in danger?'

640
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:24,750
'I think so. But I'm OK for now. I'll call
you again soon. See if you can find out anything

641
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,880
about the brief.'

642
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,880
***

643
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,470
She came early to Thomas's funeral, and she
would stay late. She found an empty room on

644
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:39,990
the third floor of a student building that
looked out over the university church. She

645
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:46,529
sat with her face to the window and saw his
parents and brother arrive. Students and staff

646
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:51,750
came in twos and threes. She pressed a handkerchief
to her eyes.

647
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:59,980
Then she saw him: it was the thin-faced man
with glasses! He was wearing a coat and tie.

648
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:07,289
He walked towards the church, looking carefully
in every direction. First they kill him, then

649
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:10,579
they come to his funeral.

650
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:16,360
Ten minutes later he came back out of the
church. He looked sad, as if Thomas had been

651
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:21,890
a friend. He put a cigarette in his mouth
and walked past some parked cars and behind

652
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:29,089
the church. Two minutes later, another man
got out of one of the cars and followed him.

653
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:35,410
The two of them reappeared after a minute,
walking together now. Then Thin-face disappeared

654
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:40,480
down the street while the other man, who was
short, returned to his car and waited for

655
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,720
the funeral service to finish.

656
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,720
***

657
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,980
The Cubans lowered the small rubber boat into
the water from their ship. They heard the

658
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:57,579
sound of the little engine as the man went
west through the darkness towards the coast.

659
00:59:57,579 --> 01:00:03,690
He would never use a commercial airline again;
the photographs in Paris were embarrassing

660
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:10,180
for a professional like himself, and his client
was not pleased. Now he was going to have

661
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:16,650
to do two jobs in a single month, which he
had never done before. But this one would

662
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:21,569
be easy - just a young woman.

663
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:28,150
In the hotel room in New Orleans, he spoke
on the phone to a man calling himself Mr Snellen

664
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,630
'Tell me about her,' he said.

665
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:35,510
'There are two photos in the briefcase.'

666
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:44,310
Khamel opened the case and took out the photos.
'I've got them. She's beautiful. It will almost

667
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,350
be a pity to kill her.'

668
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:52,859
'Yes. But all that red hair has gone. We found
some hair on the floor of a hotel room. She

669
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:54,430
has coloured it black.'

670
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,540
'Where is she now?'

671
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:02,640
'We don't know. She has stopped using her
cards to pay for things. She took out a lot

672
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,059
of money from her bank, and since then she
has disappeared. We think she's still in New

673
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:13,690
Orleans, though. Someone was in her apartment
last night. We just missed them.

674
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:21,730
'The bomb failed. We don't expect you to fail.'

675
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,730
***

676
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:28,390
Gavin was tired. He had spent two nights searching
the bars, and he was too old for these late

677
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:33,680
nights. When the phone went, he was still
asleep.

678
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,680
'Gavin?'

679
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,089
'Darby, is that you?'

680
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:38,089
'Yes.'

681
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:39,740
'Why haven't you called before?'

682
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:45,721
'That doesn't matter now. You should know
that they're here, in New Orleans. I've seen

683
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:51,460
two of them - a thin-faced man and a short
man. They were at the funeral service yesterday.'

684
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,780
'Where were you?'

685
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,920
'Watching. How long will you be in town?'

686
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,289
'Until we meet. When will that be?'

687
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:05,710
'I don't know yet. I'll call again soon.'

688
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:14,400
The phone went dead. Gavin picked it up and
threw it across his hotel room.

689
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,710
CHAPTER TEN
Another Body

690
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:25,660
The first thing she did when she woke up on
Sunday morning was listen. Was the door opening?

691
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:31,839
Was the floor outside making a noise? When
she was sure she was safe, she thought about

692
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:39,271
Thomas. She remembered their times together;
she remembered how he loved her. It was a

693
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:47,130
surprise for him, the first time he had really
been in love. And she loved him too.

694
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:53,430
After a few minutes of thinking about Thomas,
she thought about them. She had to think like

695
01:02:53,430 --> 01:03:01,710
them too, to stay alive. Where would they
be today? Where could she go? Was it time

696
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:08,630
to move hotels again? Yes. Did they know that
she was now a blonde?

697
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:16,650
She felt hungry. She had hardly eaten for
days. This hotel didn't do breakfast on Sundays,

698
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:22,650
so she had to go out. She left by the back
door, through the kitchen.

699
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:28,200
He saw her when she reached Burgundy Street.
The hair was different, but she couldn't change

700
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,580
her long legs. He started to follow her.

701
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,580
***

702
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:39,799
Khamel was practising his English when the
phone went. It was Sneller. 'She's here,'

703
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:46,319
he said. 'One of our men saw her this morning.
He chased her, but she noticed him and lost

704
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,680
him in the football crowds.'

705
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:54,630
Khamel said, 'So how am I supposed to find
her, if your men can't tell me where she's

706
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:55,630
staying?'

707
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:02,780
'It might not matter,' Sneller said. 'There's
an FBI lawyer in town. The fool has been visiting

708
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:08,760
bars and asking questions about her, spreading
his name around. He's asked anyone who knows

709
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:15,210
her to contact him at his hotel, the Hilton.
My men will continue trying to find the girl,

710
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,940
and you can stay close to him. He's in

711
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:26,439
'Room 1909. He was Callahan's best friend.
She might call him.'

712
01:04:26,439 --> 01:04:27,439
***

713
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:32,819
Gavin was lying on his bed, watching TV. It
was eleven at night. He would wait until twelve

714
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:39,420
and then try to sleep. He had decided to go
home tomorrow if she didn't call. He couldn't

715
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:47,119
find her. It wasn't his fault: even taxi-drivers
got lost in this city.

716
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,849
When the phone went, he switched the TV off
and picked it up.

717
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:54,630
'It's me, Gavin,' she said.

718
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,990
'You're alive,' he said.

719
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:01,369
'Yes, but I was followed today. It was the
short man.'

720
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:04,329
'Did he follow you from somewhere?'

721
01:05:04,329 --> 01:05:08,619
No, he just happened to see me in the streets.'

722
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:14,700
'Listen, Darby, I can't wait here any more.
I've got a job to go back to. I want to leave

723
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:20,410
New Orleans tomorrow, and I want you to come
with me. I'll have three men guarding you,

724
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:27,200
and you'll be safe. You can tell us all you
know, and then the FBI will finish the job.'

725
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:33,690
Darby thought for a minute. 'All right. Behind
your hotel there's a shopping area called

726
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:34,700
Riverwalk.'

727
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,760
'I know it.'

728
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:44,059
'Good. Find a shop called Frenchmen's Bend
and be there, at the back of the shop, at

729
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:50,609
midday tomorrow. I don't know what you look
like, so wear a black shirt and carry a newspaper.'

730
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:51,829
'This is silly.'

731
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:58,559
'No, it's not. I've had to learn fast how
to stay alive. Believe me, this is the way

732
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,940
to do it.'

733
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,839
'OK, you're the boss.'

734
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:08,880
'That's right. Only you and I will leave the
city. I don't want anyone else knowing about

735
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,470
this. Do you understand?'

736
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,240
'All right.'

737
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,200
'How tall are you?'

738
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,289
'About five feet, ten inches.'

739
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:19,920
'And how much to you weigh?'

740
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:26,230
'About a hundred kilos. I usually lie about
it. I'm going to start doing some exercise.'

741
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,160
'I'll see you tomorrow, Gavin.'

742
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,180
'I hope so.'

743
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:39,039
He put the phone down and smiled. 'Great!
At last!' he said out loud. He went into the

744
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,200
bathroom for a shower.

745
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:49,900
When he came out, the room was dark. Dark?
But he had left the light on, hadn't he? He

746
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,799
started to walk over to the light switch.

747
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:58,440
The first blow caught him in the throat. He
fell to his knees, which made the second blow

748
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:05,150
easy. It landed like a rock on the back of
his neck, and Gavin was dead.

749
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:11,580
Khamel switched on a light. He lifted up the
body and put it on the bed. He turned the

750
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:18,840
sound on the television up loud, opened his
bag and took out a cheap gun. He held it to

751
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:25,039
the right side of Gavin's head and fired.
Then he carefully put the gun in Gavin's right

752
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:31,039
hand and curled the fingers around it. It
wouldn't take a doctor very long to find out

753
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:37,619
how Gavin had really died, but Khamel didn't
need very long -by the evening of the next

754
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:41,470
day he would be out of the country.

755
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:46,849
He opened up the receiver of the telephone
and took out the little microphone. He pulled

756
01:07:46,849 --> 01:07:52,370
the recorder out from under the bed. Finally,
he checked that the cupboard where he had

757
01:07:52,370 --> 01:08:06,910
waited was clean. Then he left the room. No
one had seen him enter, and no one saw him

758
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:12,609
leave.

759
01:08:12,609 --> 01:08:17,650
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Riverwalk

760
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:23,770
Grantham couldn't find out anything about
the brief. Even Sarge hadn't heard of it.

761
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:30,400
When Darby's call came through to his office
on Monday morning he had nothing to tell her.

762
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:36,520
'It doesn't matter. I'll tell you everything
soon, I think. I don't want to die without

763
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,470
telling the world what I know. They're following
me here in New Orleans.'

764
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,470
'Who?'

765
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:48,949
'The same people who killed Rosenberg and
Jensen. If you've read the report about Callahan's

766
01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:55,469
death, you know about the white female the
police want to talk to. That's me. My name

767
01:08:55,469 --> 01:09:03,400
is Darby Shaw. Thomas Callahan was my teacher
and my lover. I wrote the brief, gave it to

768
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:09,359
him, he passed it on to the FBI, who took
it to the White House, and you know what happened

769
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,670
next. Are you recording this?'

770
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:16,089
'I'm writing it down,' Grantham said.

771
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:21,989
'I'm going to leave New Orleans. I'll call
you from somewhere else tomorrow. Can you

772
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:26,109
get a copy of the list of people who gave
large amounts of money to help the President

773
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:27,880
get elected?'

774
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:33,089
'Easy; it's public information. I'll have
it by the time you call.

775
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:36,029
'Do you have a copy of the brief?'

776
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:38,549
'No, but I remember it all.'

777
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,600
'And you know who's doing the killing?'

778
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,350
'Yes, and as soon as I tell you, your life
will be in danger too.'

779
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:48,250
'Tell me now.'

780
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:53,790
'Not so fast. I'll call you tomorrow.'

781
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:59,170
After the phone conversation Grantham went
in to see his boss, Smith Keen. He explained

782
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:06,420
the situation to him. Keen was excited, but
said, 'Even if she tells us what's in the

783
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:12,250
brief, we can't print the story; we'll need
an independent witness.'

784
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:17,750
'I'm working on it,' Grantham said, and told
him about Garcia.

785
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:23,320
'This is going to be big,' Keen said. 'This
is going to put the

786
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,550
'Post right back up at the top.'

787
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:27,550
***

788
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:33,880
She arrived on Riverwalk at eleven. She sat
in a restaurant and nervously drank a coffee

789
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:41,570
while watching the people pass. She didn't
see Thin-face or Shorty or anyone else she

790
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:48,590
recognized. At 11:45 she got up and walked
towards Frenchmen's Bend. If he wasn't there

791
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:57,530
by 12:15 she would leave. But he was there,
wearing the black shirt and carrying a newspaper.

792
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:03,820
He looked nervous too. She liked that. At
exactly twelve o'clock he walked into the

793
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,020
shop and went to the back.

794
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:10,500
She came up behind him and said, 'Gavin.'

795
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:16,440
He had practised Gavin's voice for hours,
but wasn't sure he had it exactly right. He

796
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:23,320
turned around quickly and said, 'Darby.' Then
he pretended to cough. She wouldn't expect

797
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:29,480
the same voice from someone with a cold. 'Let's
get out of here,' he said.

798
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,960
'Follow me,' she said. Darby took his hand
and led him out of the shop and towards the

799
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,000
river.

800
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,679
'Have you seen them?' he asked.

801
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:44,500
'No, but they're around somewhere.'

802
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,909
'Where are we going?'

803
01:11:45,909 --> 01:11:47,860
'Just come with me.'

804
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:55,130
'You're walking too fast, Darby. It will look
strange to people. Let me make a phone call.

805
01:11:55,130 --> 01:12:01,690
I can have men here in ten minutes and then
we'll be safe.' He was pleased with himself;

806
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,219
he sounded just right.

807
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:11,980
'No,' she said, but she slowed down. They
joined the queue for the riverboat Bayou Queen.

808
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:17,630
'The boat will take us to where I've parked
a car,' she explained. 'Then we get out of

809
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,239
here fast.'

810
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:24,690
Khamel was uncomfortable; he was wearing a
great many un-derclothes, so that he would

811
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:30,430
look as fat as Verheek. But he could wait
an hour until they were out of the city. And

812
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,889
then . . .

813
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:38,170
The man with the gun pushed his way through
the queue. He had killed before, but never

814
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:44,900
in such a public place. The queue was moving,
but he was getting through it. The man and

815
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:50,300
the woman were just about to step on to the
boat when he reached them. He pulled the gun

816
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:59,380
out of his pocket, held it to the man's head
and fired. He disappeared through the crowd.

817
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:06,160
Gavin was falling to the ground. Darby screamed
and moved back in horror. 'He's got a gun!'

818
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:11,760
a woman shouted, and pointed at Gavin, who
was on his hands and knees, with a small gun

819
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:19,000
in his right hand. Blood poured from his nose
and chin, and formed a small pool under his

820
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,790
face. His head was hanging down until it nearly
touched the ground. He was speaking some words

821
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:28,550
in a language Darby didn't recognize.

822
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:33,239
'He's Egyptian,' someone in the crowd said.

823
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:41,320
He fell forward, dropping the gun into the
water, and died in a widening pool of blood.

824
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:47,340
Darby walked away as the crowd moved forwards
to see the dead man, and two policemen started

825
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:52,330
to push their way through.

826
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,330
***

827
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:59,090
She left Riverwalk after dark. She had bought
new clothes and wore a new coat as well. She

828
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,909
waved at a taxi.

829
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:05,440
'How much to take me to Baton Rouge?' she
asked.

830
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,070
'That's a long way,' the driver said. 'You
should go by bus or train.'

831
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:14,210
'How much?' she asked again.

832
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:21,170
'One hundred and fifty dollars,' the man said,
after a moment's thought.

833
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:27,530
'Here's two hundred,' she said. 'Get me there
fast.' Thomas had talked to her about his

834
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:35,900
friend Gavin Verheek. She knew he wasn't an
Egyptian.

835
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:41,060
CHAPTER TWELVE
Darby Explains

836
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:46,570
Voyles sent East down to New Orleans to learn
the truth about Verheek's death. Lewis brought

837
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:48,120
the news to his office.

838
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:55,791
'Denton, when are we going to start taking
this Pelican Brief seriously?' he asked. 'People

839
01:14:55,791 --> 01:15:01,489
keep dying because of it. We'd better investigate
it. It must be Mattiece.'

840
01:15:01,489 --> 01:15:08,179
'I know,' Voyles said. 'We'll send down a
team of men, but I don't want the fool in

841
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:14,159
the White House or Coal to hear that we're
investigating it - I want to surprise them.

842
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:19,360
When the President told me to leave the brief
alone, I was carrying a small recorder in

843
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:27,699
my pocket. I've got every word, loud and clear.
If we find that the brief is accurate, the

844
01:15:27,699 --> 01:15:33,380
press will love us, and we can let them know
that the President told us not to investigate

845
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,380
it.'

846
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:39,020
'That'll be the end of him and Coal,' Lewis
said happily.

847
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:45,230
'I know. He'll have no chance in the election
next year. We've got him.'

848
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:52,310
They smiled at each other. 'But what about
Mattiece?' Lewis said. 'If he hadn't killed

849
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:57,900
all -those people, we wouldn't have thought
the brief was right. He must be crazy.'

850
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:06,750
'There are rumours that he is,' Voyles replied.
'I've spoken to the CIA. They had men in New

851
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:13,080
Orleans. They don't know where Mattiece is.
He's probably not in this country. He owns

852
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:19,370
houses all over the world. We'll need their
help to get him. They were following the girl

853
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:24,850
too, but they lost her in Chicago airport.
She could be anywhere by now.'

854
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:33,630
'She could be dead,' Lewis said. 'Mattiece's
men are following her as well.' ***

855
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:40,060
Grantham traced two old photographs of her
- one from her high school, one from her first

856
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:45,940
university. He pinned them up beside his desk.
She was beautiful.

857
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:51,050
She called him as she had promised. He had
read about the killing of a lawyer in New

858
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:56,750
Orleans, and she told him the true story.
She also told him about the other killing,

859
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:03,860
which had not appeared in the newspapers.
Then she said, 'Can you come to New York tomorrow,

860
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,860
Grantham?'

861
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:13,219
'Of course. It'll only take a few hours. But
please call me Gray.' He looked at the photographs

862
01:17:13,219 --> 01:17:14,840
of her.

863
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:20,050
'I'll ring tomorrow morning to tell you where
to meet me. And tomorrow I'll tell you who

864
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:22,420
killed Rosenberg and Jensen.'

865
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,969
'Do you know who did it?'

866
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:32,219
'I know who paid for the killings. I know
his name. I know his business and his politics.'

867
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:34,969
'And you'll tell me tomorrow.'

868
01:17:34,969 --> 01:17:37,520
'If I'm still alive.'

869
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:45,080
A pause. 'Perhaps we should talk immediately,'
he said. ***

870
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,950
They met in her room in the St Moritz Hotel
in New York. They chatted for a while, getting

871
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:57,130
to know each other. It was the first normal
conversation Darby had had for a week, and

872
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:03,730
it was a great pleasure. They sent out for
some food, and after they had eaten he switched

873
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:07,340
on a recorder and she told him a story:

874
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:14,530
'For centuries, the Mississippi River has
been carrying mud down to the sea. Where the

875
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:21,300
river meets the sea, marshes have spread out
over an enormous area. These marshes are the

876
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,530
home for a great many rare and unusual animals,
birds, reptiles and fish.'

877
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:35,590
'Then oil was discovered there in 1930. The
oil companies began to destroy the marshes.

878
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:40,659
Where the river mud had been creating new
land, now the sea was able to wash the land

879
01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:46,870
away. Since the discovery of oil, tens of
thousands of acres of Louisiana marshland

880
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:52,770
has gone. Every fourteen minutes, another
acre disappears under water.'

881
01:18:52,770 --> 01:19:01,290
'In 1979 an oil company owned by Victor Mattiece
found a very rich oilfield, worth thousands

882
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:08,520
of millions of dollars. Mattiece wanted it
all. He knew that others would buy the surrounding

883
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:15,080
land if they heard there was a major oilfield
there, so he pretended that nothing had happened.

884
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:22,070
He stopped work there, and waited. Slowly
and patiently, as the years passed, he bought

885
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:29,200
the surrounding land. He created new companies,
lots of them, so that no one would know that

886
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,910
he was the buyer. At last he was ready to
begin drilling.'

887
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:42,320
'Then a small environmental group called Green
Rescue made a legal request to the courts

888
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:50,320
to stop the drilling. The request was un-expected,
because for so long Louisiana had profited

889
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:56,900
from the oil companies. The court in Lafayette
agreed that all drilling should stop until

890
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,050
the case was settled.'

891
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:06,760
'Mattiece knew that this could take years.
He was dangerously angry. He spent weeks with

892
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:14,610
his lawyers, making plans. But every move
they made was disallowed by the courts.'

893
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:21,550
'People were sympathetic to Green Rescue's
case. A lot of wildlife was at risk. The marshland

894
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:27,650
where Mattiece wanted to drill was home to
a great many rare and beautiful sea birds,

895
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:34,870
including brown pelicans. There were very
few of these pelicans left. When people thought

896
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:38,260
about the case, they thought about the pelicans.'

897
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:47,200
'At last the case came to trial. Green Rescue
lost, and that was not surprising: Mattiece

898
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:53,910
had spent millions of dollars and had the
best lawyers in the country. But the judge

899
01:20:53,910 --> 01:21:01,010
still forbade the drilling to start. The pelican
was a protected bird under Louisiana law,

900
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:07,400
and Green Rescue weren't finished yet: they
would take the case all the way to the Supreme

901
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,820
Court.'

902
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:15,530
'How long would it take to reach the Supreme
Court?' Gray asked.

903
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:17,889
'Between three and five years.'

904
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:21,000
'By then Rosenberg would be dead anyway.'

905
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,780
'Yes, but it might be a Democratic President
who was choosing the judge to take his place;

906
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:37,420
Mattiece couldn't take that chance. And Jensen
was always soft on environmental cases. Mattiece

907
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:44,170
needed two Republican judges in there, both
of whom were supporters of big business.'

908
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:49,760
'Can you prove that all the companies involved
in buying the land in Louisiana are owned

909
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,239
by Mattiece?'

910
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:58,090
'It's in the brief, and I've written it all
out for you. And then there's the photograph.'

911
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:00,110
'Tell me.'

912
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:06,929
'Seven years ago, before the President was
elected, he was in New Orleans getting money

913
01:22:06,929 --> 01:22:14,480
for the Republicans. Although Mattiece stays
out of the public eye, he was there that day,

914
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:21,190
and some clever photographer got a picture
of him shaking hands with the President. Both

915
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:25,960
of them are smiling, and they look like old
friends. It's beautiful.'

916
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:33,659
'I can easily find a copy of that. This whole
thing is beautiful. It's the biggest story

917
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:41,420
since Watergate - maybe even bigger.' Gray
turned off the recorder and sat back in his

918
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:49,460
chair. They were silent for a short while.
Then he asked, 'Do you think Mattiece himself

919
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:52,300
chose Rosenberg and Jensen?'

920
01:22:52,300 --> 01:23:00,489
'No, I'm sure he had advice from a lawyer.
He's got lawyers all over the country.'

921
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:05,310
Gray sat up again. 'Does he have any in Washington?'

922
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:12,660
'Yes, there are two firms there who do some
work for him - Brim, Stearns and Kidlow is

923
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:21,699
one of them; the other is White and Blazevich,
a very old, Republican firm. But why are you

924
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:22,699
interested?'

925
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:29,540
Gray quickly told her about Garcia. 'Maybe
he works at one of those two firms,' he said.

926
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,540
'That would make it much easier to find him.'

927
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:39,090
They were both tired. She asked him to sleep
on the sofa in her room that night, so that

928
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:45,530
she could get a good night's sleep for the
first time for days. He agreed. She was so

929
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:51,869
beautiful that he would do anything to be
close her; he would even sleep on a five-foot

930
01:23:51,869 --> 01:23:56,570
sofa.

931
01:23:56,570 --> 01:24:01,570
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Washington

932
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:07,840
Darby worked in the library all morning and
rang Grantham at midday. She had been reading

933
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:13,190
lists of the members at both the Washington
law firms that worked for Mattiece; there

934
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:19,280
was no one called Garcia on either list, of
course. There were four Spanish names among

935
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:26,840
the 190 lawyers who worked for Brim, Stearns
and Kidlow, but none among the 412 who worked

936
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,150
for White and Blazevich.

937
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:36,100
She rang Gray with this information from a
pay phone in a cafe on Sixth Avenue. As she

938
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:42,590
turned to leave she saw the short man who
had been looking for her in New Orleans. He

939
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:50,610
was here, in New York, walking the streets.
He didn't look inside the cafe, however. For

940
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:58,300
the moment she was safe, but it was time to
leave New York. Two hours later, she was at

941
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,969
Newark airport.

942
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:06,650
When this was all over - if she was still
alive - where could she go? She thought of

943
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:13,120
the thousands of islands in the Caribbean;
no one could find her there. She no longer

944
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:18,880
wanted to practise law. All she wanted to
do was reach her twenty-fifth birthday, and

945
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,110
maybe her thirtieth too.

946
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,110
***

947
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:28,880
Croft spent a week waiting outside the offices
of Brim, Stearns and Kidlow. There were plenty

948
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:34,230
of lawyers who looked as young as Garcia,
and they all dressed similarly in dark suits,

949
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:40,670
but there was no Garcia. He was sure of it.

950
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:41,670
***

951
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:47,179
Some of the people employed by the White House
didn't work at the White House; some were

952
01:25:47,179 --> 01:25:53,510
so secret that their offices were elsewhere
and very few people knew of their existence.

953
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:58,400
Matthew Barr was one of these shadowy people.

954
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,690
He was riding in the back of the car with
Coal. Coal was silent while Barr read the

955
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:12,040
Pelican Brief. When he had finished, Barr
said, 'I'd love to know how much of this is

956
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,040
true.'

957
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,880
'So would we,' Coal said.

958
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,260
'What did the President say about it?'

959
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:25,380
'He agreed that the theory was implausible,
so he asked Voyles not to investigate it.'

960
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:29,800
'Really? And what if it's true?'

961
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:35,310
'Then the President has got problems. Me too.'

962
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:42,130
They rode in silence for a while and watched
the traffic. Then Coal said, 'We need to know

963
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,340
if the brief is true.'

964
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:52,080
'If people are dying, it's true. Why else
did Callahan and Verheek die?'

965
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:58,380
There was no other reason, and Coal knew it.
'I want you to do something.'

966
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,550
'Find the girl?'

967
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:04,250
'No, go to Mattiece and talk to him.'

968
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:09,000
'It won't be easy. He isn't exactly listed
in the phone book.'

969
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,780
'You can do it. You've done more difficult
things for us in the past. You've done worse

970
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,310
for us too.'

971
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:22,230
'And you think Victor will trust me and tell
me his secrets?'

972
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:29,150
'Why not? You're not a policeman. You can
help him; you can tell him that the press

973
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:35,900
will have the story soon and so it would be
a good idea for him to disappear. Then he'll

974
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,020
trust you.'

975
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,220
'What if it's true? What will you do next?'

976
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:46,949
'The first thing will be for the President
to appoint two nature-lovers to the Supreme

977
01:27:46,949 --> 01:27:54,070
Court; that will show people that we really
care for the environment. Then, at the same

978
01:27:54,070 --> 01:28:01,170
time, he will get the FBI to start an official
investigation into Victor Mattiece.'

979
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:07,929
Barr was smiling with admiration. 'What about
the photograph?' he asked.

980
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:15,330
'Easy. It's seven years old. We say that in
those days Mattiece was a good citizen, not

981
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:22,810
a madman as he is now. Anyway, by Sunday I'll
tell you where he is. I've got a man working

982
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:27,929
on it. Be ready to leave.'

983
01:28:27,929 --> 01:28:28,929
***

984
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:34,520
Darby called Gray at 9:30 the next morning
at his office. 'I'm here,' she said.

985
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:39,370
'Where are you calling from?' Gray asked.

986
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:44,570
'I'm staying at the Tabard Inn. I saw an old
friend in New York and decided it was time

987
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:51,239
to leave. I hope I didn't bring any of them
with me. I bought two plane tickets with my

988
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:57,640
card, for them to follow, but I paid cash
for the one I really used. Even then I changed

989
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:05,290
planes four times. If they follow me here,
they must be magicians. If I see any of them

990
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:07,640
here, I think I'll just surrender.'

991
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,000
'When do we meet?'

992
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:18,580
'Meet me in the restaurant here at nine tonight.
But, Gray, don't use your own car; hire another

993
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:25,130
one. And be ready to stay away from your home
and office for a few days. I've booked you

994
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:27,699
a room at the Marbury Hotel.'

995
01:29:27,699 --> 01:29:31,070
'Surely the office is safe, Darby.'

996
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:37,360
'I'm not in the mood to argue. If you're going
to be difficult, Gray, I'll simply disappear.

997
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:46,929
I'm sure I'll live longer out of the country,
anyway. I've got to go now. You be careful.'

998
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:47,929
***

999
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:52,190
The Marbury was close to where his boss, Smith
Keen, lived, and there were some things they

1000
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:58,690
had to talk about. The next morning he rang
Keen from his room and they arranged to meet

1001
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:05,080
outside the front of the hotel in fifteen
minutes. While they drove around in Keen's

1002
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:11,650
car they discussed various ways in which they
could use the information they had. They agreed

1003
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:18,030
that finding Garcia was the key to the whole
story; without Garcia they had little more

1004
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:25,679
than rumour and an unlikely theory. They hoped
that Garcia's information really was as important

1005
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,420
as they were guessing it was.

1006
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:34,000
She had told him to stay off the streets and
to eat in his room. After Keen had left him

1007
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,179
near his hotel, he bought a sandwich and a
cup of coffee, and returned to his room. An

1008
01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:46,890
Asian cleaning woman was working outside his
room. 'Did you forget something, sir?' she

1009
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:53,060
asked. Gray looked at her. 'What do you mean?'

1010
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,760
'You just left your room, sir, and now you're
back.'

1011
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,820
'I left two hours ago.'

1012
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:04,780
'No, sir. A man left your room ten minutes
ago.' She hesitated and looked at his face

1013
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:10,570
closely. 'But now I see that it was another
man, sir.'

1014
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:16,710
He walked quickly to the stairs and ran all
the way down to the ground floor. What was

1015
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:25,100
in his room? Nothing important - just some
clothes. Nothing about Darby. Her phone number

1016
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,420
at the Tabard Inn was in his pocket.

1017
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:35,050
He had to find her, and quick.

1018
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:40,739
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Curtis D. Morgan

1019
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:45,400
Darby spent the day in the Georgetown law
library, reading and taking notes about the

1020
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:52,770
members of the Washington law firms that Mattiece
used. It was boring work, and her mind often

1021
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,050
wandered.

1022
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:57,510
She thought a lot about Thomas.

1023
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:58,510
***

1024
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:02,719
Matthew Barr went to New Orleans, where he
met a lawyer who told him to fly to a certain

1025
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,290
hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

1026
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:11,619
He wouldn't tell Barr what was going to happen
there, but when Barr arrived he found a room

1027
01:32:11,619 --> 01:32:17,960
waiting for him. A note at the front desk
of the hotel said he would receive a phone

1028
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,480
call in the early morning.

1029
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:27,690
He called Fletcher Coal at home at ten and
told him the news.

1030
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,690
***

1031
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:35,060
She stepped on the note when she opened her
door. It said: Darby, I'm in the garden. It's

1032
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:44,179
urgent. Gray. She locked the door, went downstairs,
through the restaurant and out into the garden.

1033
01:32:44,179 --> 01:32:49,120
She found him sitting at a small table, half
hidden behind a wall.

1034
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:56,790
'Why are you here?' she demanded in a whisper.
He told her what had happened, and what he'd

1035
01:32:56,790 --> 01:33:02,510
done for the rest of the day. He had spent
it riding round the city in a dozen different

1036
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:10,810
taxis, waiting for dark. Then he came to the
Tabard. He was certain that no one had followed

1037
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:11,810
him.

1038
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:16,940
She listened. She watched the restaurant and
the entrance to the garden, and heard every

1039
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,160
word.

1040
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:24,100
'I have no idea how anyone could find my room,'
he said.

1041
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:30,699
'Did you tell anyone your room number?' He
thought for a second. 'Only Smith Keen, but

1042
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:33,520
he didn't have time to tell anyone else.'

1043
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,170
'Where were you when you told him?'

1044
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:38,600
'In his car.'

1045
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:45,440
She shook her head slowly. 'I told you not
to tell anyone, didn't I? You think this is

1046
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:52,280
all a game. It's not, Gray, it's real. This
isn't just a great newspaper story, which

1047
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:59,949
is going to make Gray Grantham famous and
win him prizes. I've seen people die. God

1048
01:33:59,949 --> 01:34:06,690
knows how many times I've been close to death
myself. These people are dangerous, and they're

1049
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:12,920
professionals. They know about you and the
Washington Post. They've probably been listening

1050
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:18,330
to you since you wrote the first story about
this matter. They'll have microphones hidden

1051
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:24,510
in your apartment, your car and your office.
It looks as though they've got microphones

1052
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:31,770
in Keen's car as well. Do you understand what
I'm saying? Last night at dinner we tried

1053
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:38,130
to pretend we were two normal people getting
to know each other. But that wasn't real:

1054
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:41,860
this is real.'

1055
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:47,530
She was right, of course. He felt like a schoolchild
in front of an angry teacher.

1056
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:56,910
'You can stay here tonight,' she said, 'and
tomorrow I'll find you another small hotel.'

1057
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:57,910
***

1058
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:02,489
After breakfast the next morning she got on
the phone. She rang the Georgetown law school

1059
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:09,300
and pretended to be from White and Blazevich.
She said that their computers were not working,

1060
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:13,850
and that for the sake of her records she needed
to know which students had worked for White

1061
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:20,900
and Blazevich last summer. She waited, with
her hand over the mouthpiece of the phone,

1062
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:27,740
and looked at Gray. The secretary from the
law school came back on the phone. 'Seven

1063
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:36,550
of them,' Darby said. 'Thank you.' She wrote
down their names. 'And do you have their addresses,

1064
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:42,010
please? We need them for our records.' She
wrote down this information too.

1065
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:49,570
'That was brilliant,' Gray said when she had
finished. 'Now all we need to do is find as

1066
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:55,500
many of these students as we can, show them
your photograph of Garcia, and hope that one

1067
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:59,369
of them recognizes him and can tell us his
real name.'

1068
01:35:59,369 --> 01:36:04,540
'Why couldn't we just wait outside the firm's
building until he came out, and then follow

1069
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:08,190
him? That's what Croft was doing at Brim,
Stearns and Kidlow.'

1070
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:15,280
'Too risky. It seems likely that White and
Blazevich were involved in some way in the

1071
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:21,670
killings. There are people who know my face,
and we know they're looking for you too. What

1072
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:28,580
if they're guarding White and Blazevich? They
would see us, and then we'd be dead.'

1073
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:34,699
They hired a car and began to try to find
the seven students. Gray found two of them

1074
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:40,920
at home and Darby spoke to another as he was
leaving a class at the school; none of them

1075
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:49,010
recognized Garcia. They met at 10:45 and compared
notes. At eleven, students were leaving their

1076
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:56,239
classes and she found another of the seven
students, but he too knew nothing. A fifth

1077
01:36:56,239 --> 01:37:01,699
was working in the library; she didn't like
answering Darby's questions, but she admitted

1078
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:04,300
that she didn't know Garcia.

1079
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:12,699
Only two left - Edward Linney and Judith Wilson.
Wilson was expected back at her apartment

1080
01:37:12,699 --> 01:37:18,650
at one o'clock, so Gray spent the rest of
the morning trying to find Linney, but he

1081
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:24,970
was not at home and no one at the school seemed
to know where he was. They hadn't seen him

1082
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,980
for several weeks.

1083
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:35,400
They drove together to Judith Wilson's apartment.
She wasn't there at one, so they waited. She

1084
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,739
arrived an hour later. Gray jumped out of
the car, ran up to her and caught her at her

1085
01:37:41,739 --> 01:37:48,119
front door. He showed her the photograph,
and Darby saw her shake her head.

1086
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:54,969
'Linney had better be good,' he said as he
got back into the car. 'But where is he?'

1087
01:37:54,969 --> 01:38:02,639
'I hope we find him today,' she said, 'because
tomorrow I leave the country if we don't.'

1088
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:09,921
Back at the law school, one of his fellow
students at last told them where he was: in

1089
01:38:09,921 --> 01:38:16,240
a private hospital. He was well on the way
to becoming an alcoholic, and his parents

1090
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:22,170
had ordered him to spend some time there.
The nurse at the front desk of the hospital

1091
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:29,690
told Gray that Mr Linney was in Room 22, but
refused to let him see him. Gray asked to

1092
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:38,230
see the manager, and while the nurse was fetching
him Gray whispered to Darby, 'Room 22.'

1093
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:44,340
She left the waiting-room and boldly walked
to his room. She knocked and went in. The

1094
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:48,139
young man looked surprised to see her.

1095
01:38:48,139 --> 01:38:56,370
'I'm Sara Jacobs,' she said. 'I work for the
Washington Post. May I ask you a question?'

1096
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:58,659
'Yes, but how did you get in?'

1097
01:38:58,659 --> 01:39:05,410
'I just walked in. You worked at White and
Blazevich last summer, didn't you? Do you

1098
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:10,080
recognize this man?' She showed him the photograph.

1099
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:19,080
'Yes, he's . . . what's his name? I can't
remember. He works in the oil and gas department.'

1100
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,900
Darby held her breath.

1101
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:28,010
Linney closed his eyes and thought. 'Morgan.
Yes, that's it. His surname is Morgan, but

1102
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:33,010
I can't remember his first name. What's this
all about?'

1103
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:38,750
'I'll tell you later,' Darby said, and left.

1104
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:44,489
Gray was waiting for her back in the car.
She didn't say anything but immediately looked

1105
01:39:44,489 --> 01:39:53,420
at the notes she had taken in the law library.
There he was. 'Garcia is Curtis D. Morgan,'

1106
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:59,670
she said. 'Let's go.'

1107
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:02,480
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Two Appointments

1108
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:10,070
After five hours at sea in the small, fast
boat, every bone in Matthew Barr's body was

1109
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:17,100
aching, and he was wet and cold. His only
companion had been a man called Larry, who

1110
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:24,320
was extremely tall and looked very strong.
Larry had met him in Fort Lauderdale and had

1111
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,969
not said a word to him since then.

1112
01:40:27,969 --> 01:40:34,130
They landed in a country Barr believed was
the Bahamas. A car took them to a small airfield,

1113
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:41,260
where a Lear jet was waiting. The flight took
about forty-five minutes. Another car took

1114
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:46,489
them to a large house. Barr had no idea where
they were.

1115
01:40:46,489 --> 01:40:52,690
Barr was met by a man who called himself Emil,
who led him round the outside of the house

1116
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,270
to a sunroom.

1117
01:40:54,270 --> 01:41:01,501
'I'm afraid you must take off your shoes,'
Emil said with a polite smile, 'and be careful

1118
01:41:01,501 --> 01:41:03,680
not to step on the towels.'

1119
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:09,540
Inside, Barr saw that towels were lying on
the floor of the sun- room, making paths around

1120
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:17,580
the room. A door on the other side of the
room opened, and Victor Mattiece came in.

1121
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:25,469
Barr stared. Mattiece was an extraordinary
sight. He was extremely thin, and had long

1122
01:41:25,469 --> 01:41:32,820
grey hair and a beard. He wore only a pair
of black sports shorts. His toenails were

1123
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:38,870
yellow and very long. He looked completely
crazy.

1124
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:48,880
'Sit over there,' he said, pointing at a chair.
'Don't step on the towels.'

1125
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:58,560
When Barr was seated, Mattiece asked, 'What
do you want?' He was staring out of a window.

1126
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,219
'The President sent me,' Barr began.

1127
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:07,389
'He did not. Fletcher Coal sent you.'

1128
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:14,719
'All right. We need to know whether the Pelican
Brief is true. Have you read it?'

1129
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,909
'Have you?'

1130
01:42:16,909 --> 01:42:18,010
'Yes.'

1131
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:21,790
'Does Mr Coal believe it to be true?'

1132
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:29,659
'I don't know. He's very worried. That's why
I'm here, Mr Mattiece. We have to know.'

1133
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:32,730
'What if it is true?'

1134
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:36,900
'Then we have problems.'

1135
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:43,410
Mattiece turned away from the window, looked
at Barr and said, 'Do you know what I think?

1136
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:50,670
I think Coal is the problem. He let too many
people see the brief.'

1137
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:56,980
Barr could not believe what he was hearing.
The man who had ordered so many deaths was

1138
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:05,300
blaming someone else for the situation. 'Is
it true, Mr Mattiece? That's all I want to

1139
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,790
know.'

1140
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:15,420
Behind Barr, a door opened without a sound.
Larry, in his socks and avoiding the towels,

1141
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:19,050
stepped silently into the room.

1142
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:26,909
Mattiece walked over to the door and said
softly, 'Of course it's true.' He left the

1143
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:30,650
sun-room and went into the garden.

1144
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:34,030
Now what? Barr thought.

1145
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:39,340
Larry put the rope round Barr's neck, and
Barr did not hear or feel anything until it

1146
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:49,190
was too late. Mattiece did not want blood
on the floor, so Larry simply broke his neck.

1147
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:50,190
***

1148
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:54,820
They reached the building where White and
Blazevich's offices were before five o'clock.

1149
01:43:54,820 --> 01:44:00,950
She was wearing a dress, and Gray said she
looked just right. She could tell that he

1150
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:07,119
liked the way she looked, and she found to
her surprise that it didn't make her angry,

1151
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,659
just a little sad about Thomas.

1152
01:44:10,659 --> 01:44:16,280
She walked up to the secretary at the desk,
who said, 'Can I help you?'

1153
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:25,099
'Yes, I have an appointment at five o'clock
with Curtis Morgan. My name is Dorothy Blythe.'

1154
01:44:25,099 --> 01:44:29,560
The secretary's mouth fell open and she said
nothing.

1155
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:34,010
Darby's heart stopped. 'Is something the matter?'

1156
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:40,760
'Can you wait a moment?' the secretary said.
She got up and disappeared into another room.

1157
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:48,659
Run, Darby's mind was telling her, run! There's
something wrong here. But before she had time

1158
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:52,570
to do anything, the secretary returned with
a man.

1159
01:44:52,570 --> 01:45:01,530
'Good afternoon,' he said. 'I'm Jarreld Schwabe,
one of the partners of the firm. You say you

1160
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:04,230
have an appointment with Curtis Morgan?'

1161
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:08,250
'Yes. Is there a problem?'

1162
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:10,150
'There's nothing in his appointment book.'

1163
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:13,960
'Well, that's your fault, not mine.'

1164
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,969
'And what was the meeting about?'

1165
01:45:16,969 --> 01:45:24,360
She felt weak. 'I don't see why I have to
tell you that. Why can't I see Mr Morgan?'

1166
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,460
'Because he's dead.'

1167
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:31,220
She was in shock. 'Dead?'

1168
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:40,010
'Yes,' Schwabe said. 'He was mugged in the
street. I'm sorry. I can see this has been

1169
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:42,550
a shock for you.'

1170
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:48,650
She decided to act really upset. She didn't
want them to ask any more questions; she wanted

1171
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:55,420
them to think that she was just a weak young
woman. 'I'm sorry,' she said, 'I think I'd

1172
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,620
better go. I'll phone again for another appointment.'

1173
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:03,619
Schwabe led her to the lift himself.

1174
01:46:03,619 --> 01:46:10,970
Edwin Sneller knew that he and his men had
been wasting their time in New York; the place

1175
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:18,670
was just too big. Then at last she moved some
money from her bank in New Orleans to Grantham's

1176
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:25,040
bank in Washington. Sneller's client owned
the bank, so he received any information he

1177
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:32,570
asked for. That meant that she was in Washington,
and that she and the reporter were working

1178
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:38,580
together. He had two men with him, and he
had asked for more. They had to do the job

1179
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:46,679
quickly. But he felt less confident without
Khamel. The girl had escaped so far, and she

1180
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:53,080
could be hiding anywhere. He would start with
the Washington Post building: Grantham had

1181
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:57,320
to come back there some time.

1182
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,320
***

1183
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,159
Gray found Curtis D. Morgan's address in the
suburbs, and they drove out together to the

1184
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:10,409
house. Mrs Morgan's father, however, refused
to let them in to see her. Gray left his business

1185
01:47:10,409 --> 01:47:16,530
card, so that she could call him if she wanted
to. He told her father that Morgan had spoken

1186
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:19,610
to him three times just before he died.

1187
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:26,230
'Is that the end of Garcia?' Darby asked as
they drove away.

1188
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:33,550
'We'll see tomorrow,' he said. 'How do you
feel at the moment? Do you feel safe? I'll

1189
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:38,580
be glad to sleep in your room tonight, just
like I did in New York.'

1190
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:47,060
'But I don't have a sofa here,' she said.
'Where would you sleep?' She was smiling and

1191
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:56,429
this was a good sign. But then she remembered
Callahan. 'I'm not ready, Gray. I'm sorry.'

1192
01:47:56,429 --> 01:48:01,620
She rested her head on his shoulder while
he drove the car. 'I'm still frightened to

1193
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:07,320
death,' she said.

1194
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:12,409
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Morgan's Story

1195
01:48:12,409 --> 01:48:19,020
Beverly Morgan called Gray at four o'clock
the next morning. 'My father would be angry

1196
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:24,630
with me if he knew I was calling,' she said.
'The reporters were horrible to us after Curtis

1197
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:29,000
was killed. But I need to talk to someone.'

1198
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,869
She asked him how he knew her husband, and
Gray explained about his phone calls, and

1199
01:48:33,869 --> 01:48:40,119
the murders of Rosenberg and Jensen. He spoke
to her patiently for a long time, until he

1200
01:48:40,119 --> 01:48:41,550
won her confidence.

1201
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:45,179
'What do you think he knew?' she asked.

1202
01:48:45,179 --> 01:48:52,170
'I have no idea. If he had written something
down on paper, where would it be?'

1203
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:57,810
'In our lock-box in the bank. But that's where
all his legal papers were, so I've already

1204
01:48:57,810 --> 01:49:03,770
looked in there. I did find another key in
his desk, though, last Saturday.'

1205
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:07,040
Gray held his breath. 'A key to another lock-box?'

1206
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:16,619
'Yes, a box at First Columbia Bank. That's
odd, because we've never used that bank. I

1207
01:49:16,619 --> 01:49:21,349
wasn't in a hurry to go to the bank and look
in the box, because I already had all his

1208
01:49:21,349 --> 01:49:26,639
legal papers. Maybe it was even something
I wouldn't want to see.'

1209
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,929
'Would you like me to look in the box for
you?' Gray asked.

1210
01:49:30,929 --> 01:49:35,250
'I hoped you would say that. Yes, please.'

1211
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:36,800
'I'll come round and get the key now'

1212
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,139
***

1213
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:45,650
He and Darby drove to the bank the next morning.
Mrs Morgan had given Gray written permission

1214
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:51,920
to open the lock-box, so the clerk let them
into the strong-room. It didn't take them

1215
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:58,090
long to empty the box: all it held was a thin
envelope.

1216
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:03,909
Darby opened the envelope when they were back
in the car. Inside was a document written

1217
01:50:03,909 --> 01:50:12,650
by Morgan and properly signed by a legal witness.
The document started: 'Since you are reading

1218
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:19,120
this, I am probably dead.' It was a powerful
first sentence.

1219
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:27,159
In the document Morgan described who he was
and where he worked. He said that he often

1220
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:34,180
worked for one of the firm's clients who was
called Victor Mattiece. The partner in charge

1221
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:42,170
of Mr Mattiece was F. Sims Wakefield. Morgan
explained the Louisiana case and how important

1222
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:48,989
it was to Mr Mattiece. It was important to
White and Blazevich too, since Mattiece had

1223
01:50:48,989 --> 01:50:52,750
promised them a share of the profits from
the oil.

1224
01:50:52,750 --> 01:51:01,639
On or about 28 September, the document continued,
Morgan had been in Wakefield's office collecting

1225
01:51:01,639 --> 01:51:09,300
some files. When he returned to his own office,
he found that by mistake he had picked up

1226
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:16,150
a note from Wakefield's desk together with
the files. A copy of the note was joined on

1227
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:25,349
to Morgan's document. The note was dated 28
September and was from Marty Velmano, another

1228
01:51:25,349 --> 01:51:34,750
partner. It read: Sims: Tell our client that
the Court will be easier on him if Rosenberg

1229
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:44,889
is retired. The second retirement is a bit
unusual - it is Jensen (who, as you know,

1230
01:51:44,889 --> 01:51:54,489
has those other problems). The note amazed
and frightened Morgan. Realizing its importance,

1231
01:51:54,489 --> 01:52:00,659
he made a copy of it and returned the original
to the bottom of the pile of files.

1232
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:07,840
Ten minutes later Wakefield came into his
office, looking pale and worried. They found

1233
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:16,940
the note under the files and Wakefield asked
Morgan if he had read it; Morgan said no.

1234
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:22,440
Wakefield looked at him very closely, but
seemed satisfied.

1235
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:28,989
That night he left the papers on his desk
very tidy. The next morning he could see that

1236
01:52:28,989 --> 01:52:36,530
someone had searched his desk. He began to
see Velmano in Wakefield's office more than

1237
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:42,300
usual. Wakefield stopped him working for Mattiece.

1238
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:50,969
Then Rosenberg and Jensen were killed. He
was sure that Mattiece had ordered the killings.

1239
01:52:50,969 --> 01:52:57,110
He thought that people were following him.
He had decided to hide his copy of the note

1240
01:52:57,110 --> 01:53:05,710
together with this document in a bank, in
case he was killed. He was very frightened.

1241
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:10,020
That was the end of the document.

1242
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,020
***

1243
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:16,239
The thin-faced man watched the car come fast
round the corner and park illegally outside

1244
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:23,599
the Post building. The man and the woman jumped
out of the car and ran past him into the building.

1245
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:30,599
He had a gun inside his jacket, but it all
happened too fast.

1246
01:53:30,599 --> 01:53:31,599
***

1247
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:38,280
Smith Keen and the Post's lawyer, Vincent
Litsky, read through Morgan's document. When

1248
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:46,020
they had finished, Gray said, 'Well, gentlemen,
there's your independent witness. Can we print

1249
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:49,170
Darby's story now?'

1250
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:54,670
Keen and Litsky looked at each other. Keen
left the office for a few minutes to speak

1251
01:53:54,670 --> 01:54:03,780
to the newspaper's owner. When he came back
he said, 'OK, Gray. We do the story. How long

1252
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:06,810
will it take you to write it?'

1253
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:12,679
'I already know the shape of it,' Gray replied.
'I only have to write the details. It should

1254
01:54:12,679 --> 01:54:15,760
take me about two hours.'

1255
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:22,869
'It's eleven o'clock now,' Keen said. 'Try
to finish it by three. Litsky needs time to

1256
01:54:22,869 --> 01:54:26,280
read it before we print.'

1257
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:32,750
With Darby's help, he finished the story on
time. Keen and Litsky read it and made some

1258
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:37,610
changes. Darby was watching something out
of the window.

1259
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:44,860
'When I've rewritten the story,' Gray said,
when Keen and Litsky had finished, 'I have

1260
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:46,659
to make some phone calls.'

1261
01:54:46,659 --> 01:54:51,949
'We'll be back at half past three,' Keen said.

1262
01:54:51,949 --> 01:54:58,619
'They're outside,' Darby said softly, when
Keen and Litsky had left the room.

1263
01:54:58,619 --> 01:55:00,090
'Who are?'

1264
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:06,699
'I was watching a man standing on the corner.
He looks innocent enough; he's just standing

1265
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:12,930
there drinking coffee from a cup. But he's
been there a long time - I saw him earlier

1266
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:20,239
as well. And just now, when you were talking,
I saw the short man who chased me last week

1267
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:25,889
come up to the coffee-drinker. They talked
for a minute and then the short man disappeared

1268
01:55:25,889 --> 01:55:33,710
again. They're just waiting for us to leave
the building.'

1269
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:39,070
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Time to Trust Someone

1270
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:43,340
The first phone call was to a friend of Grantham
at the FBI.

1271
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:48,320
'Phil, this is Gray Grantham. I've got the
recorder on.'

1272
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,719
'That sounds serious. Go on.'

1273
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:57,829
'We're going to print a story tomorrow about
the Rosenberg and Jensen killings. We're going

1274
01:55:57,829 --> 01:56:02,989
to name Victor Mattiece as the man behind
the killings, and also two of his lawyers

1275
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:10,040
here in Washington. We'll connect this story
with the killing of Verheek in New Orleans.

1276
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:15,599
We believe the FBI knew about Mattiece early
on but refused to investigate at the request

1277
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:24,219
of the White House. We want to give you the
chance to comment.' There was silence. 'Phil,

1278
01:56:24,219 --> 01:56:26,119
are you there?'

1279
01:56:26,119 --> 01:56:29,000
'Yes, I think so.'

1280
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,780
'Any comment?'

1281
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:35,869
'I'm sure we will have a comment, but I'll
have to call you back.'

1282
01:56:35,869 --> 01:56:39,540
'OK. I'll look forward to it.'

1283
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:45,389
In fact it was Voyles himself who called back,
about ten minutes later. He demanded to speak

1284
01:56:45,389 --> 01:56:46,620
to Smith Keen.

1285
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:52,820
'What are you doing, Smith?' he said. 'We're
still investigating Mattiece. It's too early

1286
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:55,500
to be sure. What have you got?'

1287
01:56:55,500 --> 01:57:00,480
'Does the name Darby Shaw mean anything to
you?' Keen asked.

1288
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,480
'Yes.'

1289
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:07,449
'We have the Pelican Brief, Denton, and I'm
sitting here looking at Darby Shaw.'

1290
01:57:07,449 --> 01:57:09,980
'I was afraid she was dead.'

1291
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:15,449
'No, she's not. And she and Gray Grantham
have an independent witness to support the

1292
01:57:15,449 --> 01:57:18,500
brief. It's a big story, Denton.'

1293
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:24,320
'We need to meet. I'll come round in twenty
minutes.'

1294
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,119
'OK.'

1295
01:57:26,119 --> 01:57:31,750
Keen put the phone down and smiled. He was
amused at the idea of the great F. Denton

1296
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:36,510
Voyles coming round to his office for a meeting.

1297
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:42,560
The next phone call Gray made was to Fletcher
Coal in the White House. Coal agreed that

1298
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:47,969
Mattiece had given large amounts of money
towards the President's election, but denied

1299
01:57:47,969 --> 01:57:53,400
that Mattiece and the President were close
friends. He had to admit that he was familiar

1300
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:59,260
with the Pelican Brief. When Gray asked why
there had not been an immediate investigation

1301
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:06,389
of Mattiece, Coal angrily denied that the
White House had tried to slow down such an

1302
01:58:06,389 --> 01:58:07,389
investigation.

1303
01:58:07,389 --> 01:58:14,260
Then Voyles arrived with K. O. Lewis. Keen
took him into his own office and gave him

1304
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:21,469
a copy of the story to read while Gray made
the third phone call. He rang White and Blazevich

1305
01:58:21,469 --> 01:58:27,449
and was put through to Marty Velmano. For
the third time he explained that he was recording

1306
01:58:27,449 --> 01:58:29,400
the conversation.

1307
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:35,840
'Mr Velmano,' Gray said, 'we're printing a
story in the morning which names your client

1308
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,880
Victor Mattiece as the man behind thekillings
of Rosenberg and Jensen.'

1309
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:49,540
'Good!' said Velmano. 'We'll take you to court.
By the time we're finished, Mr Mattiece will

1310
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:52,159
own the Washington Post.'

1311
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:58,989
'Mr Velmano, we have a copy of the Pelican
Brief. Have you heard of it?'

1312
01:58:58,989 --> 01:59:00,139
Silence.

1313
01:59:00,139 --> 01:59:09,099
'We also have a copy of a note you sent to
Sims Wakefield on 28 September. In the note

1314
01:59:09,099 --> 01:59:14,820
you suggested that your client's position
would be a lot better without Rosenberg and

1315
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:16,619
Jensen on the Supreme Court.'

1316
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:17,760
Silence.

1317
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:23,440
'Mr Velmano, are you there?'

1318
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,570
'Yes.'

1319
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:31,320
'We wanted to give you the chance to comment.
Do you have any comment?'

1320
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:37,720
'You're going to destroy me,' Velmano said.

1321
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:38,720
***

1322
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:44,469
Voyles and Lewis entered the room with Smith
Keen. Keen introduced them to Darby and Gray.

1323
01:59:44,469 --> 01:59:50,420
Voyles smiled at Darby and said, 'So you're
the one who started all this.'

1324
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:55,810
'No, sir,' she said, 'I think it was Mattiece.'

1325
01:59:55,810 --> 02:00:02,660
They sat around a table. Voyles had a piece
of paper. He said, 'I'm going to read you

1326
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:09,150
something. This is official, and you can use
it in your paper. Anything else Lewis or I

1327
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:15,500
say is unofficial, and you can't use it. Is
that clear?'

1328
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,330
Keen and Grantham said yes.

1329
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:25,580
'All right,' Voyles said. 'We received a copy
of the Pelican Brief two weeks ago and showed

1330
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:31,780
it to the White House on the same day. It
was personally delivered by K. O. Lewis to

1331
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:41,030
Fletcher Coal. Eric East was also present
at the meeting. We thought it was worth investigation,

1332
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:48,889
but nothing happened for six days, until Gavin
Verheek was murdered in New Orleans. The FBI

1333
02:00:48,889 --> 02:00:56,440
began a full investigation into Victor Mattiece,
involving over four hundred men. We believe

1334
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:02,810
Victor Mattiece to be the main suspect in
the murders of Rosenberg, Jensen, Thomas Callahan

1335
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:06,489
and Verheek, and we are trying to find him.'

1336
02:01:06,489 --> 02:01:12,920
'Did the White House interfere with your investigation
of Mattiece?' Grantham asked.

1337
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:21,020
'This is now unofficial,' Voyles said. 'You
can't use it. OK?'

1338
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:22,440
'OK.'

1339
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:29,180
'Yes, the President asked me not to investigate
Mattiece. He said it could be embarrassing

1340
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:34,510
to the Government. I recorded the conversation.'

1341
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:39,020
They could hardly believe what they were hearing.
He recorded the President!

1342
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:46,869
'I will not allow anyone to hear that recording,'
Voyles continued, 'unless the President denies

1343
02:01:46,869 --> 02:01:53,452
what I have just told you. Anyway, will you
use the official story I've given you? Will

1344
02:01:53,452 --> 02:01:59,420
you put Coal's name there on the front page
along with everyone else?'

1345
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:03,831
'Yes, I think he belongs there,' Keen said.

1346
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:12,470
'Good,' said Voyles. 'Can you give me some
early copies of the newspaper tomorrow morning?

1347
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:16,250
I want to take them round to him myself and
watch his face.'

1348
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:23,349
'He'll take the blame,' Keen said. 'It will
be the end of his career, but he'll make the

1349
02:02:23,349 --> 02:02:25,320
President look innocent.'

1350
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:34,360
'Yes, I think you're right,' said Voyles.
'Now, I'd like to speak to Miss Shaw alone,

1351
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:37,159
please, if that's all right with her.'

1352
02:02:37,159 --> 02:02:40,500
'OK,' she said, 'but Grantham stays.'

1353
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:43,780
'All right.'

1354
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:51,140
When everyone else had left the room, Voyles
asked, 'What are you going to do next?'

1355
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:55,030
'First tell me who killed Gavin Verheek,'
she said.

1356
02:02:55,030 --> 02:03:01,450
'It was Khamel. And Khamel was the one who
was shot in the head as you were holding his

1357
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:03,050
hand by the river.'

1358
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:05,140
'Who killed him?'

1359
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:11,600
'We think it was someone from the CIA. We
know the CIA were investigating Mattiece in

1360
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:17,829
a small way. In his oil business Mattiece
had connections with some unfriendly Arab

1361
02:03:17,829 --> 02:03:24,510
countries, so the CIA were already keeping
an eye on him. When they saw a copy of the

1362
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:30,510
Pelican Brief they sent a few men down to
New Orleans to look after you.'

1363
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:36,980
Darby got up and went to the window. It was
dark outside now. 'They didn't do a very good

1364
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:42,261
job, then,' she said. 'There are men out there
now who have been following me for a week

1365
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:49,869
or more. One of them chased me in New Orleans,
so I don't think he's CIA. Mattiece is so

1366
02:03:49,869 --> 02:03:55,920
crazy that he'll go on trying to kill me even
after he goes to prison - if you catch him.'

1367
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:02,630
'We can help,' Voyles said. 'We can get you
out of the country.'

1368
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:09,920
It was time to trust someone. She took a deep
breath. 'All right,' she said.

1369
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:14,000
'I'll go and make the arrangements,' Voyles
said.

1370
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:20,969
Alone in the room, Darby walked into Gray's
arms. 'It's going to be all right now,' he

1371
02:04:20,969 --> 02:04:26,020
said, holding her. 'It's over. You're safe.'

1372
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:34,670
'I'm going alone, Gray,' she said. 'I'll call
you when I'm ready.'

1373
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:37,330
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Away From It All

1374
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:46,510
By 11 p.m. only four lawyers remained in the
offices of White and Blazevich. They were

1375
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:55,530
Velmano, Sims Wakefield, Jarreld Schwabe and
a retired partner named Frank Cortz.

1376
02:04:55,530 --> 02:05:03,969
Cortz finished a phone conversation with one
of Victor Mattiece's staff. 'That was Strider,'

1377
02:05:03,969 --> 02:05:12,929
he said. 'They're in Cairo, in some hotel.
Mattiece won't talk to us and, of course,

1378
02:05:12,929 --> 02:05:19,809
he isn't coming back over here. Strider says
he's behaving very strangely. They've told

1379
02:05:19,809 --> 02:05:25,929
the boys with the guns to leave town immediately.
The chase is over.'

1380
02:05:25,929 --> 02:05:30,369
'So what are we supposed to do?' asked Wakefield.

1381
02:05:30,369 --> 02:05:38,350
'We're on our own,' said Cortz. 'Mattiece
isn't going to help us.'

1382
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:46,550
There was silence around the table as they
all looked into the future. Then Velmano said,

1383
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:53,980
'Grantham only mentioned me and Sims. You
two may be OK. And I've got enough money saved

1384
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:56,699
to spend the rest of my life hiding in Europe.'

1385
02:05:56,699 --> 02:06:05,579
'It's all right for you,' Wakefield said.
'I can't hide. I've got a wife and six children.'

1386
02:06:05,579 --> 02:06:12,760
'I think you should go home and tell your
wife what to expect,' Velmano said.

1387
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:20,010
'I can't do that,' Wakefield said. He got
up and left the room.

1388
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:29,429
A minute later they heard the sound of a single
gunshot from his office.

1389
02:06:29,429 --> 02:06:30,429
***

1390
02:06:30,429 --> 02:06:34,489
After eight days in the sun of the Virgin
Islands her skin was brown enough and her

1391
02:06:34,489 --> 02:06:40,570
hair was returning to its natural colour.
She walked miles up and down the beaches and

1392
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:47,750
ate nothing except fish and fruit. She slept
a lot the first few days.

1393
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:53,380
She looked at her wrist and then remembered
that her watch was in a bag somewhere. She

1394
02:06:53,380 --> 02:07:01,030
didn't need it here. She woke with the sun
and went to bed after dark. But now she was

1395
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:04,370
waiting, so she had looked at her wrist.

1396
02:07:04,370 --> 02:07:11,639
It was almost dark when the taxi stopped at
the end of the small road. He got out, paid

1397
02:07:11,639 --> 02:07:17,910
the driver and looked at the lights as the
car disappeared back up the road. He had one

1398
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:24,349
bag. He could see a light from the house between
the trees at the edge of the beach, and he

1399
02:07:24,349 --> 02:07:32,630
walked towards it. He didn't know what to
expect. He knew how he felt about her, but

1400
02:07:32,630 --> 02:07:35,770
did she feel the same?

1401
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:42,329
She was waiting at the back of the house,
looking out to sea, with a drink in her hand.

1402
02:07:42,329 --> 02:07:47,760
She smiled at him, put down her drink and
let him come to her.

1403
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:53,079
They kissed for a long minute. 'You're late,'
she said.

1404
02:07:53,079 --> 02:07:59,580
'This is not the easiest place to find,' Gray
said. 'Even when you have directions.'

1405
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:08,059
'I know,' she said. 'That's the idea. It's
beautiful, though, isn't it?'

1406
02:08:08,059 --> 02:08:10,829
'It is. You are too.'

1407
02:08:10,829 --> 02:08:14,869
'Let's go for a walk,' she said.

1408
02:08:14,869 --> 02:08:20,940
He changed into a pair of shorts and they
walked together on the beach, hand in hand.

1409
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:24,280
'You left early,' she said.

1410
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:31,119
'I got tired of it. I've written a story a
day since the big one, and they kept wanting

1411
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:38,239
more. I was working eighteen hours a day.
Yesterday I said goodbye.'

1412
02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:43,059
'I haven't seen a paper for days,' she said.

1413
02:08:43,059 --> 02:08:50,159
'Coal's finished. The President will be OK.
I don't think he did anything really bad;

1414
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:56,500
he's just stupid. He won't get reelected,
though. You read about Wakefield?'

1415
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:00,570
'Yes, that was in the last paper I saw.'

1416
02:09:00,570 --> 02:09:07,710
'They've got Schwabe. They want Velmano too,
but he's disappeared. Of course Mattiece is

1417
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:13,130
in deep trouble, and they're after four of
his men too.'

1418
02:09:13,130 --> 02:09:17,960
They walked in silence along the beach. She
put her arm round his waist and he pulled

1419
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:28,949
her closer. 'I've missed you,' she said softly.
He breathed deeply, but said nothing. 'How

1420
02:09:28,949 --> 02:09:31,929
long will you stay?' she asked.

1421
02:09:31,929 --> 02:09:40,739
'I don't know. A couple of weeks. Maybe a
year. It depends on you.'

1422
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:45,710
'Let's take it a month at a time. OK, Gray?'

1423
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:46,710
'Perfect.'

1424
02:09:46,710 --> 02:09:47,100
- THE END -
