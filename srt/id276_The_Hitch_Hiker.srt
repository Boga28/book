The Hitch Hiker

00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,320
by Tim Vicary

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,360
CHAPTER ONE

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,920
The stranger

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,080
I don't usually pick up hitch-hikers, but this one was
different.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:17,840
He wasn't young, like the others, and he didn't have a bag, or a girlfriend, or a sign with "London" or "Lancaster" on
it.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,040
He just stood there, beside the road, with his hand out,
waiting.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,280
He was a man about forty years old, in a grey suit and red
tie.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,520
He was just watching the cars and waiting.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,640
He was watching me while I slowed down.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,120
I remember his eyes.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,760
Very pale blue eyes, staring at me through thin gold
glasses.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,760
They looked surprised.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,240
Perhaps I was something strange, something not quite real to
him.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Or perhaps he just had bad eyes.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,040
Perhaps he couldn't see very well.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,640
I stopped the car and opened the window.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,440
"Where are you going?" I asked.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,560
"I'm going into town," he said.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,080
"Into Lancaster. Could you give me a lift, please?"

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,760
"Yes, OK," I said.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,600
"I'm going that way. Jump in."

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
He got in and sat down beside me.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,400
"Thank you very much," he said.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,200
"It's very kind of you."

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,000
"That's all right," I said.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
"It's my pleasure."

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,520
I started the car and thought about the words he had used.

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,200
There was something strange about them.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,280
Hitchhikers don't usually speak like that.

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,480
They usually say something like "Are you going to Lancaster?
Oh good, thanks a lot".

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,480
He spoke politely, like an older man.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,040
But this man wasn't very old.

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,960
"Perhaps he's foreign," I thought.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,880
I looked at him, and noticed something else.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,200
"Could you put your seat-belt on, please?" I said.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
He looked at me.

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,760
"I'm all right," he said.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,200
"I don't like seat-belts very much. I feel like a prisoner
in the car."

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:06,160
"It's the law, you know. And I'm a police sergeant, so I
think you should wear one in my car."

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
"Oh, yes.

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm so sorry. The law. Yes... yes, I forgot." He looked
around him, but for a moment he couldn't find the seat-belt.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
"It's there, behind you," I said.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,640
"You do it like this." I helped him to put on the seat-belt.

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,600
"Yes, thank you," he said.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,680
"I'm terribly sorry. I never remember these things."

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,920
"Oh, really," I said.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,240
"Why? Don't you have a car?"

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:56,280
"No. Not now. I don't like them. I did have one once, but that was a long time ago..." For a moment I thought he would
continue, but then he stopped

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,000
talking and stared quietly out of the window.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,760
I looked at him again.

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm a police officer, so it's my job to look at people and
to think carefully about them.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,480
I was sure there was something strange about this man.

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,400
His hair – nobody has their hair cut quite like that now.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,360
And that suit – it was quite clean, quite new, but the
trousers and lapels were wider than they usually are...

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,160
Where had I seen a suit like that before?

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,640
"Do you live near here?" I asked.

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,840
I was still wondering about him.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
Was he a foreigner?

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,360
He smiled at me.

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,600
"I live in Lancaster. In the centre of the town, in fact."

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,080
I was listening carefully.

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,160
"He speaks very good English," I thought.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:56,160
"He speaks in the local way. I don't think he is a foreigner. But that face! It's the middle of summer now, and
we've had a lot of sun this year. Why is he so pale?"

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,840
"What sort

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,480
of job do you do?" I asked.

67
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,920
He smiled at me again.

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,920
"Oh, I don't have a job at the moment," he said.

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,720
"That's why I don't have a car now, you see."

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,520
"You haven't driven for a long time, then?" I said.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,720
He looked at me again.

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,000
That same quiet, surprised look.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,160
"No, I haven't," he said.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
"Not for a long time."

75
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,920
I smiled at him.

76
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,080
"I thought you hadn't," I said.

77
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,160
"You've had to wear seat-belts in a car for many years.
Sorry," I continued.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,640
"It's my job. Police officers always play at detectives!"

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
"Yes, I see," he said.

80
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,280
He smiled.

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,040
A quiet, polite smile was on his mouth, but those pale eyes
were still and empty.

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,600
Then for a moment I stopped thinking about him because there
was a lot of traffic on the road.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Cars were moving very slowly, and I saw a policeman in
front, with several police cars and flashing blue lights.

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,040
I knew the policeman, so I stopped the car beside him.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,480
"What's the matter, John?" I asked.

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,440
"It's an accident, Sue," he said.

87
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,640
"One car stopped suddenly, and another car went into the
back of it."

88
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,280
"Anyone hurt?"

89
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,600
Three people, I think, but they don't look too bad.

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,680
The ambulance will be here soon."

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,000
"Do you need any help?" I wasn't in uniform, but I had to
ask.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,120
He thought for a moment, and I heard the sound of the
ambulance.

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
It was coming towards us.

94
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:45,360
"Well, it looks quite nasty, but we'll be OK when the ambulance comes, Sue. There are two police cars here
already. But you can ask the sergeant over there, if you like. He'll

95
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,720
know."

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,080
"All right, John, thanks." I drove on slowly to the
accident.

97
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,520
There was glass all over the road, and the two damaged cars
were by the side of the road on the left.

98
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,080
It seemed that one car had hit the back of the other, and
pushed it off the road.

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,160
A young girl was sitting at the side of the road with a
policeman.

100
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,880
Her face was covered in blood.

101
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,960
A man was lying on the ground beside the second car, and
another policeman was kneeling beside him.

102
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,960
The sergeant was talking to the driver of the first car, who
was still in his seat.

103
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,240
CHAPTER TWO

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,920
An accident

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,000
I parked the car, got out, and went over to the man on the
ground.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,080
"Is there anything I can do?" I asked the policeman.

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
He looked up, surprised, and then he recognized me.

108
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:39,400
"Oh, it's you, Sue. I think he's OK. He's breathing, and his
heart's fine. But I don't like the look of that leg."

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,840
One of the man's legs was broken in two places.

110
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,680
It looked like there were two knees.

111
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,920
He was breathing, but his eyes were closed, and his face was
very white.

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,280
"Can you go and help Chris with the little girl?" he said.

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,040
"I think this man is her father."

114
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,960
I looked at the little girl.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,200
She was trying to walk, but she seemed confused.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,520
The policeman was holding her arm.

117
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,720
I went over and knelt in front of her.

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,960
There was blood all over her face.

119
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,040
I couldn't see her eyes very well.

120
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
"Hello," I said.

121
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,080
"My name's Sue. I'm a police officer. Can you see me?"

122
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,560
She wiped her face with her hand, and nodded.

123
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,120
"Good," I said.

124
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,680
"What's your name?"

125
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,320
"Kate."

126
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,840
Kate.

127
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,560
OK.

128
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,000
Kate, you heard that sound just now, didn't you?

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,440
That was the ambulance.

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:35,280
This policeman, Chris, and I are going to take you over to the ambulance, and then the ambulance men will take you to
the hospital and look after you.

131
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
You're going to be all right."

132
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,240
"But what about my daddy?"

133
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,800
"He'll come with you in the ambulance. He's going to be all
right, too."

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,080
I held one of the girl's arms, and Chris held the other.

135
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,920
We took the little girl over to the ambulance and sat talking with her while the ambulance men lifted her father
and the other driver into the ambulance.

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,120
When the ambulance had gone, I spoke to the sergeant for a
few minutes.

137
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,080
"What happened?" I asked.

138
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,520
"I don't know yet," he said.

139
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:16,080
"I think the first car stopped suddenly, but I can't think why. Still, that's something that we'll have to find out.
It's a funny place for an accident. I can only remember one

140
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:32,320
here before - about twenty years ago, I think it was. That was a nasty one, too. A young man was killed - run over by a
car. I remember that a little child was hurt then,

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,800
too."

142
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,880
"What happened then?"

143
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,800
"He shook his head. "I can't remember now.

144
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,080
Anyway, this one'll be your job in the morning - I'm on
holiday next week, remember?

145
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,640
Thanks for your help."

146
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,840
On the way back to the car, I could see one of the
policemen.

147
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,240
He was picking up the little girl's doll from the side of
the road.

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,400
He walked over and put it in the police car.

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
CHAPTER THREE

150
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,640
A frightened passenger

151
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,880
When I got back into the car, the hitch-hiker was still
there.

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,520
He did look very strange - for a moment, I thought he was
crying.

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,360
"I'm sorry," he said, "but I hate accidents. Were... were
they badly hurt?"

154
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
I looked at him quickly.

155
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
His face was very pale.

156
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,920
And... were his hands shaking?

157
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,240
"Quite badly," I said.

158
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,760
"One had a broken leg, and the young girl had a lot of glass
in her face. But I think they'll live."

159
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,280
"Oh, good. I... I'm sorry I didn't get out, but you see... I
hate seeing

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,960
blood."

161
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,320
I smiled.

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
That's all right.

163
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,800
I don't like it either, but I'm a police officer - it's my
job."

164
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
"Yes. I suppose you see a lot of accidents?"

165
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:54,920
"Quite a lot, yes. But it's funny, I've never seen one here before. The road's very straight and it was clear of
traffic, and it's

166
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,240
not dark or anything. A car stopped suddenly, and another
car hit it. It's very strange."

167
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,480
For a moment my passenger didn't answer.

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,600
He just looked straight in front of him, the grey eyes in
the pale face staring at the road and the traffic.

169
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,360
Then he said, very quietly:

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,920
"Cars do terrible things, don't they? I hate cars. I hate
them!"

171
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
I didn't say anything for a minute.

172
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,840
Then I asked him if he had a family in Lancaster.

173
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:35,200
"Yes, I have one son. He's at the University, you know. I'd
been there just now, before you picked me up."

174
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,480
"Oh, really? Does he like it there?"

175
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,040
"Yes, I think so. Yes, he likes

176
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,960
it very much." He smiled at me - the same grey, pale smile.

177
00:10:45,960 --> 00:11:01,880
"But I still have to look after him, you know. He does silly
things, and gets into lots of trouble. He needs me, you know - I'm sure he'd have an accident if I didn't keep an eye

178
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,680
on him all the time."

179
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,160
That was a very strange thing to say about a son at
university.

180
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,360
My sister is at the University too, but I don't think my
father knows what she's doing every day.

181
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,920
I don't think he wants to know - and I'm quite sure she
doesn't want her father "keeping an eye" on her all the
time!

182
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,520
But before I could say anything else, we had reached the
centre of the town.

183
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,280
I stopped the car outside the cemetery.

184
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,040
"If you want the centre of the town, this is the best
place," I said.

185
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,880
"I'm driving home after this."

186
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,400
"This is perfect." He opened the door carefully and got out.

187
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,760
Thank you very much.

188
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,880
You're very kind."

189
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:49,840
"My pleasure." I watched him walk away, a short, pale man in
that strange, old-fashioned suit.

190
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,880
Then I drove out into the traffic and forgot about him.

191
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,080
CHAPTER FOUR

192
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Where's the body?

193
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,520
Next morning, I found the reports of the car accident on my
desk.

194
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,280
There were photographs of the two cars after the crash, and
a plan of the area.

195
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,240
The two cars had been drawn on the plan.

196
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,440
The police had also spoken to two students.

197
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,360
They had been walking beside the road at the time of the
accident.

198
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:26,360
The students had both seen the first car swerve suddenly in
front of the second car and then stop, for no reason.

199
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,960
But the police hadn't spoken to the drivers of the two cars
because they were too ill.

200
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,600
So I had to go to the hospital to talk to them.

201
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
PC Brian Jones came with me.

202
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:47,400
The doctors said we couldn't talk to the driver of the second car or the little girl, so we went to see the driver
of the first car.

203
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,480
He was sitting up in bed.

204
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:56,600
He could talk now, but he had hurt his neck quite badly
because the car had stopped very quickly.

205
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,680
But it seemed that he didn't want to say much.

206
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,040
"Good morning, Mr Jackson," I said.

207
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,760
"I'm a police sergeant. The doctor tells me you're feeling
much better this morning."

208
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,480
"A bit," he said.

209
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,160
"But I still can't move my neck. If you want to talk to me,
sit on the end of the bed, and then I can see you."

210
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,400
I sat on the end of the bed and looked at him.

211
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,960
He was about thirty years old, with a thin, brown face, a
small moustache, and dark hair.

212
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,520
He looked very unhappy, and his eyes always looked away from
me when he spoke.

213
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,280
"I suppose you want to know about the accident?" he asked.

214
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,120
"That's right, Mr Jackson. Can you remember anything about
it?"

215
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:50,880
"Remember it? Yes, of course I can. I've been thinking about
it all night. But it wasn't my fault, honestly. You

216
00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:03,120
must believe me! I was driving along quite slowly - about forty-five miles an hour, I think, or maybe fifty, but no
more, really. Anyway, there's no special speed limit on that

217
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
road, is there?"

218
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,920
"Only the limit for normal roads. You can go up to sixty
miles an hour."

219
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,640
"Well, I wasn't driving as fast as that. I was driving quite
slowly, the road was

220
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:25,000
clear, and I hadn't been drinking. In fact, I never drink and drive, never - I'm sure the doctors tested that, didn't
they, Officer?"

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,160
I looked at my notes.

222
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:33,520
"Yes, I think so. It doesn't say anything here about
alcohol, Mr Jackson."

223
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:41,920
"So it couldn't be my fault, could it? I mean, I was going
at a normal speed, slowly even, on a sunny

224
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,880
day, and I hadn't been drinking, and then there he was!
Right in front of me!"

225
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,040
I felt confused.

226
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,040
"I'm sorry, Mr Jackson, I don't understand. Who was in front
of you?"

227
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,160
He stared at me strangely.

228
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,800
"Well, the man, of course. The man who was killed."

229
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,040
Now I was really confused.

230
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:18,200
"What? I'm sorry, Mr Jackson, but no one was killed. The people in the other car were hurt, but they're both alive.
One has a broken leg, I think, and the little girl hurt her

231
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,640
face, but that's all."

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,080
"Which car?" asked Mr Jackson.

233
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,920
"The car that hit you from behind."

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
Now Mr Jackson looked confused.

235
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,480
He looked even more unhappy, and his face went white, as
white as the bandage round his neck.

236
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,760
"Do you mean... are you telling me that a car hit me from
behind, Officer?"

237
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,000
"Yes."

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He put his hands to his neck.

239
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,400
He had been trying to shake his head but he couldn't.

240
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
"I don't remember that," he said.

241
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,880
"You don't remember anything about a car that hit you from
behind?"

242
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:00,240
"No, nothing. And you say there were two people in it? A man
and a girl? Oh, how terrible." He began to cry,

243
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,560
and took a handkerchief from the table beside his bed.

244
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,000
I thought carefully.

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:17,680
"Let's start from the beginning, Mr Jackson. You say you were driving along slowly, about forty-five miles an hour.
Is that right? Then what happened? Think carefully, and tell me

246
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,760
slowly."

247
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,280
He put the handkerchief down, and stared at me, his eyes big
and wide.

248
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:40,960
"Well, then I saw him, that's all. A man. He was running across the road in front of me. He didn't look where he was
going, or anything. He was just - there - suddenly. I tried to

249
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,240
stop, but it was too late. Poor man - I couldn't miss him!"

250
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,800
I waited until he had finished.

251
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,560
The nurse gave him a drink of water.

252
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,440
Then I asked, quietly:

253
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:00,720
"Mr Jackson, do you remember anything about this man? I
mean, what did he look like?"

254
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,640
He looked at me strangely.

255
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:15,880
"Well, I didn't have much time, did I? I suppose he was about forty or fifty years old, in a suit or something, I
don't know. His face was very white - I suppose that was because

256
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:29,000
he was frightened. I think he had glasses on, and there was something red - perhaps it was a tie, or maybe it was the
blood, I don't know. But why does it matter? You've got the

257
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,480
body, haven't you? You know who he is."

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,760
I looked at PC Jones.

259
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,960
This man's crazy," I thought. "Perhaps he has hurt his head,
too."

260
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,600
I felt sorry for him.

261
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,040
I spoke very slowly and carefully.

262
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,560
I tried to make my voice as kind as I could.

263
00:17:46,640 --> 00:18:00,000
"Mr Jackson, we haven't found a body. No one was killed in the accident. You didn't hit anyone. You just stopped your
car suddenly, and the car behind ran into you, that's

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,400
all."

265
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,800
"But... does that mean you're going to prosecute me?" he
asked.

266
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,600
"I'm not sure yet, Mr Jackson," I said.

267
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:18,720
"We haven't finished our investigations. But I'm afraid the police usually prosecute people for dangerous driving if
they stop suddenly for no reason."

268
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
"But you can't do that!

269
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:32,160
I'd lose my job! I'm a salesman. I drive hundreds of miles every week, and nobody can work for our company if they have
been prosecuted for dangerous driving. That's why I never

270
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:44,680
drink and drive - never! And I never stop without a good reason! There was a man there, in front of me - I told you!
I saw him as clearly as I can see you now!"

271
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,360
"Well, I'm sorry,

272
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,640
Mr Jackson," I said.

273
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,880
"But there was a serious accident, and at the moment it
seems it was your fault. That's all I can say for now."

274
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
CHAPTER FIVE

275
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
The doctor explains

276
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,960
Outside the room, the nurse stopped us.

277
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,760
"Could you both wait in here a moment, please?" she said.

278
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,560
"I think the doctor would like to speak to you."

279
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:13,160
We heard the nurse talking to the doctor outside the room
for two or three minutes, and then the doctor came in.

280
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,080
She smiled at me.

281
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,320
"Good morning, Sergeant Fraser," she said to me.

282
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,800
"You've been talking to Mr Jackson, haven't you?"

283
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,440
"Yes," I said.

284
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,160
"Poor man - he's not very happy, I'm afraid."

285
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,400
"No, of course not," said the doctor.

286
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:43,280
"Well, it was a nasty accident, wasn't it? And he's hurt his neck quite badly. But the rest of him is OK. He should be
out of hospital in a few days."

287
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,320
"Yes." I looked at the

288
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,240
doctor carefully.

289
00:19:46,280 --> 00:20:00,080
"Doctor, are you sure that he hasn't hurt anything else? His head, perhaps? You see, I don't think he remembers the
accident very well. He thinks he killed somebody who walked in

290
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:08,560
front of the car, but he didn't. Nobody was killed, nobody walked in front of the car. And he doesn't remember the
second car at all."

291
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,800
"Yes, I know," she said.

292
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:23,560
"I wanted to talk to you about that. Of course, people do forget accidents. That's normal. They often don't remember
anything about them. So I'm not surprised that he doesn't

293
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:33,240
remember the second car. But it's very unusual to remember something that didn't happen." She stopped for a moment, and
looked at me thoughtfully.

294
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:47,080
"So I thought... perhaps I shouldn't say this, but I thought you should know. Last night this man had a small problem
with his heart, a very unusual problem. For a few minutes it

295
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:56,680
beat very slowly, it nearly stopped, and then it started again. And people who have a heart problem like that aren't
usually allowed to drive, you know, because they might become

296
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,720
ill for a couple of minutes, and then of course a car would
stop suddenly."

297
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,000
"I see," I said.

298
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,240
"So you think that perhaps he had a small heart attack
yesterday, too?"

299
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,480
"I don't know," she said.

300
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:16,040
"Maybe he had the attack because of the accident. I haven't seen his doctor's records, so I don't know if he has ever
had this problem before."

301
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,000
"I see," I said.

302
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,760
"Well, thank you, Doctor. That's very helpful."

303
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,560
CHAPTER SIX

304
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
A good explanation

305
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,880
"That explains it then," said Brian Jones, as we drove back
to the police station.

306
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,240
There wasn't a man in front of his car, and he knows it.

307
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,640
I mean, if the man did have this heart problem, then he
couldn't have a job as a salesman, could he?

308
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,200
He wouldn't have a driving license, and he'd lose his job.

309
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,920
And he's very afraid of losing his job, isn't he?

310
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,200
He told us that."

311
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,080
"Yes," I said.

312
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,400
"But that doesn't explain his story, does it?"

313
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,320
"Well, yes, maybe it does, Sergeant," he said.

314
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,880
"Look at it this way. Perhaps this man had a problem with his heart several years ago, and then he got better, so he
got his driving license back. His job and his driving license

315
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:17,520
are very important to him, so he always drives very, very carefully. He never drinks and drives or does anything
silly. And why is he so very, very careful? Because he's always

316
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:29,600
afraid that one day his heart problem will come back, and then he'll lose his license, his job, and everything. Then
yesterday it did come back, and so he had this accident. But

317
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:42,760
he wants us to believe that it wasn't his fault, so he has invented a story about a man who ran in front of the car.
Only it isn't a very good story, that's all, because there

318
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,080
wasn't a man, and there isn't a body."

319
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
Brian Jones smiled at me.

320
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,000
He is a young, clever policeman, and he was very pleased
with himself.

321
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,880
It was a good explanation, too.

322
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,720
I couldn't see anything wrong with it.

323
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
Back at the police station, I checked everything carefully.

324
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,960
But no one had found a body, no one had seen a man who ran
across the road.

325
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,160
I looked at the front of Mr Jackson's car carefully with one
of the police scientists.

326
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,280
There were no marks on it at all.

327
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,520
Only the back of his car was damaged, where the car behind
had hit it.

328
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,720
Either Mr Jackson was mad, or he was lying.

329
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,040
But I felt sad, and a little angry, too.

330
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,560
The doctor at the hospital had been very helpful, but why
had she told us about Mr Jackson's heart problem?

331
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,840
That was wrong.

332
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,200
I wouldn't want my doctor to tell people about me when I was
ill.

333
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,520
Mr Jackson's story was crazy, but I really think that he
believed it.

334
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,880
In my job, you know when people are lying - and I thought Mr
Jackson was telling the truth.

335
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,600
CHAPTER SEVEN

336
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,120
Simon

337
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,000
I talked about it with my boyfriend, Simon, at dinner that
night.

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,760
Simon is a reporter, so he has to be very careful.

339
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,080
He must never write about anything I tell him in his
newspaper.

340
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,760
If he did, I would lose my job.

341
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,040
But we still talk about things, and sometimes it is very
useful.

342
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,600
I told him about the accident, and Mr Jackson's story.

343
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,760
He looked at me thoughtfully.

344
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,040
"It's a strange place for an accident, isn't it?" he said.

345
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,240
"The road's very straight there."

346
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,040
"That's right," I said.

347
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,080
"No one ever stops there. I only stopped because I..."

348
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,680
For a moment I stopped talking, my fork in my hand.

349
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:38,160
"Sue? Sue, what's the matter?" Simon said.

350
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,680
"Simon, that's it! I've remembered the thing that worries me
about all this! The hitch-hiker!"

351
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,560
"What?"

352
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:52,080
"The hitch-hiker! The man Jackson described - pale face,
suit, glasses,

353
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,440
red tie. There was a man like that in my car!"

354
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,600
Quickly I told Simon about the man that I had picked up
before I saw the accident.

355
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:06,880
"Yes, but he wasn't dead, Sue - he was in your car, quite safe. And you picked him up a long way away from the
accident."

356
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,000
"Not very far away - about half a kilometre, perhaps.

357
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,280
The traffic was moving very slowly - because of the
accident. Maybe he walked there. It's possible."

358
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,840
"You mean, perhaps the hitch-hiker was walking across the
road, and Jackson

359
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,760
saw him, stopped his car, and then the other car hit
Jackson's car?"

360
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,800
"Yes, that's right! And then the hitch-hiker ran on down the
road, and then I picked him up! Simon, I have to

361
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,920
find that man!"

362
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,200
Simon looked thoughtful.

363
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:52,760
"Yes, but wait a minute, Sue. Why would the hitch-hiker cross the road there? There's nothing there. And anyway, if
he was walking towards you, he was walking away from town, not

364
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,600
towards it!"

365
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,240
I shook my head.

366
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:12,200
"I don't know. But I want to find him. He said he lived in Lancaster. And another thing, Simon. One of the older police
sergeants said there had once been an accident on that road

367
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:23,000
before - something about a child, I think it was - about twenty years ago, maybe more. Can you check in your old
newspapers and find out about it? I think it may help."

368
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,720
Simon

369
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:23,880
groaned.

370
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,720
"You want me to check the records for a little thing like
that? Do you know how long that takes?"

371
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,040
I smiled at him.

372
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,360
"But you'll do it for me, won't you Simon?" I said.

373
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,480
"Please."

374
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,400
CHAPTER EIGHT

375
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,480
Flowers on a grave

376
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,400
It took Simon a long time, but he found the newspaper story
in the end.

377
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,560
We met for lunch in the park in the middle of town, and he
took it out of his pocket.

378
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:52,680
He showed it to me and I read it carefully - a small yellow piece of paper, a newspaper story about a road accident
eighteen years ago.

379
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,640
FATHER KILLED IN ROAD CRASH

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,760
Son saved by brave dad

381
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,800
A man was hit by a car and killed in an accident on the main
road outside Lancaster yesterday.

382
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,880
Police said the man, twenty-five-year-old Mr David Holland,
ran straight in front of the car.

383
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,240
The car driver had no time to stop, and Mr Holland was
killed immediately.

384
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:22,040
A three-year-old boy, Mr Holland's son Michael, was found by
the side of the road, crying.

385
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,240
A woman, Mrs Helen Steadman, was walking with her dog by the
side of the road.

386
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,520
Mrs Steadman said that Mr Holland had been driving towards
Lancaster with his son.

387
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,880
Just before the accident he had stopped his car by the side
of the road, and both of them had got out.

388
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,280
"I think perhaps the little boy wanted to go to the toilet,"
Mrs Steadman said.

389
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:53,560
"But before his father could stop him, he ran straight out across the road, in front of the traffic. Mr Holland ran
after him, and managed to pick up the little boy and throw him

390
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:03,560
to the side of the road. But then a car hit the father. It wasn't the driver's, fault - the little boy ran straight out
into the road without looking, and his father ran out after

391
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,720
him. Then I ran to catch the little boy before he could go
back into the road again."

392
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,600
The police said that Mr Holland was dead when they arrived.

393
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,000
He will be buried in Lancaster cemetery on Tuesday.

394
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,160
The little boy's mother died a year ago, so he will live
with his grandparents in Carnforth,

395
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,840
This is the first accident that anyone can remember on this
part of the road.

396
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,000
The road is very straight there and is usually very safe.

397
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,280
The police do not think the car driver was driving fast.

398
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,120
I put down the old yellow piece of paper and thought for a
minute.

399
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,440
Eighteen years ago a man had run in front of a car and been
killed, on the same part of the road.

400
00:28:45,440 --> 00:29:01,720
And yesterday, there had been another accident, and the driver of the first car - Mr Jackson - was quite sure that
he had seen a man who had run out in front of him, and was also

401
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,920
sure that he had hit him in exactly the same way.

402
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,640
"It's interesting, isn't it?" Simon said.

403
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,720
"But it doesn't help much, does it? Have you found your
hitch-hiker yet?"

404
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,280
"No," I said.

405
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:23,920
"I've checked all our police records, and we have no records of anyone who looks like him. And of course he didn't tell
me his name."

406
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,120
"I see," said Simon strangely.

407
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,080
"There is one other interesting thing that I haven't told
you."

408
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,600
"Oh? What's that?"

409
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,720
"Well, every day I walk through the cemetery on my way to
work. I know the place quite well -

410
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:49,840
sometimes I sit and have my sandwiches there at lunchtime. And so I notice the other people who come there - the people
who put flowers on the graves and eat their lunch there.

411
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:59,480
Sometimes I even read the gravestones, you know. I often wonder about them. What were the people like? How long did
they live? It's very interesting."

412
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,000
"In your lunch hour? How

413
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,400
strange!" I said.

414
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:16,400
"Do you think so? I like it. It's quiet and peaceful there, so I can think and read. Anyway, there's one grave there
that always has flowers on it. A young man comes to put them

415
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:26,680
there. He's a student, I think. And when I read this newspaper story, I knew I'd seen the name Holland somewhere
before. At first I couldn't remember the place that I'd seen it.

416
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:40,080
Then I remembered - it's the name on this gravestone: David Holland! I checked this morning because I wanted to be
certain. And the date on the stone was the same too, 1978. It's

417
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,640
the same man who was killed in the accident!"

418
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,360
"So?" I asked.

419
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:56,760
"What's surprising about that? It isn't surprising that he was buried there. He came from Lancaster. And I suppose that
the young man who brings the flowers is his son. That would

420
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,880
be normal, wouldn't it?"

421
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,240
"Maybe," he said.

422
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:12,320
"But not every day, not after eighteen years. Anyway, the cemetery is just over there. Why don't we go and have a
look? We can go that way back to the car."

423
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,080
"OK, if you like. I

424
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,360
didn't know that you were so interested in gravestones,
Simon."

425
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,480
We got up and walked quietly through the park and into the
cemetery.

426
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,120
It was a nice, sunny summer afternoon.

427
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,640
Neither of us wanted to hurry back to work.

428
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,840
"There it is, look." Simon pointed, and I saw a grave just
like all the others.

429
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,880
There were a few red flowers on it.

430
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,080
We walked towards it, but then a young man came past us on
the path.

431
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,080
He knelt down beside the grave.

432
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,880
He took the old flowers away, and put some fresh ones beside
it.

433
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,880
We stopped a few metres away, and watched.

434
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
The young man stayed very quietly beside the grave for
several minutes.

435
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,600
I could see his mouth moving.

436
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,000
It seemed that he was talking to someone.

437
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,360
"He's praying, Simon," I said.

438
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,360
"Come on, let's go. We shouldn't stand and watch him."

439
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
"OK," he said, and we moved slowly away.

440
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,800
"But don't you think it's strange?" he asked, while we were
getting into the car.

441
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:22,320
"I mean, his father has been dead for about twenty years, and this young man comes here nearly every day, with fresh
flowers, and prays beside the grave."

442
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,920
"Yes, I suppose it is," I said.

443
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:33,400
"But that's his business, not ours. And it doesn't help me
with this accident. Come on, let's go."

444
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,560
CHAPTER NINE

445
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,120
An unhappy man

446
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,080
Liter that afternoon I had to meet Mr Jackson.

447
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,240
I didn't want to, but I had to.

448
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,640
He came into my office unhappily, and sat down in front of
me.

449
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,240
He still had a bandage around his neck.

450
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,200
"Good afternoon, Mr Jackson," I said.

451
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:03,320
"I'm sorry, but I have investigated this accident very carefully now, and I will have to prosecute you for
dangerous driving."

452
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,680
His face went white, and I could see his hands

453
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,520
begin to shake.

454
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,080
"But... I'll lose my job," he said.

455
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,560
"You know that, don't you?"

456
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,680
"Yes," I said.

457
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:28,560
"I understand that, and I'm very sorry. But your car swerved and stopped suddenly for no reason, and two people were
badly hurt in the other car. They were lucky. You nearly

458
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,040
killed them."

459
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,240
"But what about the man?" he shouted.

460
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,320
"I told you, I saw a man! He crossed the road in front of
me! I'm not crazy, you know - I saw him!"

461
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,080
"I know," I said.

462
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:56,200
"And I think you believe it yourself. But we've looked for that man, and we can't find him. Two students saw the
accident from the side of the road, you know, but they didn't see

463
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:05,400
a man who crossed the road either. I'm sorry, Mr Jackson, but nobody else saw this man - only you. Perhaps your doctor
can explain it, but I can't."

464
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,920
His hands were shaking even

465
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,440
more now, and for a moment he couldn't speak.

466
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,400
Perhaps he's going to have a heart attack now, I thought,
here in this room.

467
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,320
After a moment he stood up and walked to the door.

468
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,280
At the door he turned and stared at me.

469
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
"You..." he began.

470
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:34,000
"You're wrong! I'm not mad, you know, and I'm not ill either! You wait! One day you'll see something like this,
and no one will believe you either. Then you'll know how I feel!"

471
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,640
He walked out, shutting the door loudly behind him.

472
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,600
CHAPTER TEN

473
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,680
The return

474
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,240
That Saturday, I had to go to the University.

475
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,160
My younger sister, Elisabeth, had just finished her studies,
and she was getting her degree.

476
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,360
My parents had come to watch, and we were all going out for
a meal afterwards.

477
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,760
I put on a nice dress after work and went to the University.

478
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,280
When I got there, we sat and watched and listened, and then
everyone had tea outside on the grass.

479
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:12,840
It was a funny day: all the students were wearing good clothes, instead of their normal jeans and T-shirts, and
they all took their parents round to meet their friends and their

480
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,360
friends" parents. Everyone was standing there, talking to
strangers and feeling a little embarrassed.

481
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,560
I was just getting myself another cup of tea when I saw him.
He was standing

482
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,960
there with a cup of tea in his hand, and a silly smile on
his face - the hitch-hiker!

483
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,120
I stood quite still and watched him. He was standing in a
group with two young men -

484
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:46,280
students - and two older people. They talked and smiled for a few minutes, and then the hitch-hiker and one of the
students moved away and began to talk to another family

485
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,800
group.

486
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,120
"That student is his son!"

487
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,720
I thought.

488
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,160
"And I know him, too! He's the young man we saw in the
cemetery!"

489
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,480
The hitch-hiker was still very pale and he was still wearing
that old-fashioned suit.

490
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,960
I noticed another strange thing, too - none of the other
parents talked to him.

491
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,600
In fact, one man nearly walked straight into him.

492
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,360
But I didn't think much about that, then.

493
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:20,520
I knew that I had to talk to him - perhaps he could help me
about the accident, even now.

494
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,360
I smiled, and walked towards him.

495
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,480
"Hello," I said.

496
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,040
"I didn't think that I'd see you again!"

497
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,080
He turned quickly, and for a moment I was sure he was
afraid.

498
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,200
Or perhaps I was the first person who had spoken to him that
afternoon.

499
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,960
But then he smiled too.

500
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,240
"How nice," he said.

501
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,000
"You're the lady who gave me a lift into town a week ago,
aren't you?"

502
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,080
So he remembered me, too.

503
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,680
That was interesting.

504
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,120
He looked worried.

505
00:36:49,200 --> 00:37:02,280
"But you're a policewoman, aren't you? So you can't be a student, and you're not old enough to be a parent. So why
are you here? Has there been a crime?"

506
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,960
"No," I said.

507
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,760
"My sister's getting her degree, that's all. Is this your
son?"

508
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,680
"Yes," he said.

509
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,920
"Michael, come and meet my policewoman friend. She gave me a
lift in her car the other day."

510
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,960
Michael smiled and shook my hand, but I thought he looked a
little nervous.

511
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,440
"That... er... that was very kind of you," he said.

512
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:35,680
"My father doesn't have a car, and he's always missing the bus. He never manages to catch the bus if I don't take him
to the bus-stop myself."

513
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
I didn't know what to say.

514
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,800
"If he's the young man we saw in the cemetery," I thought,
"then his father's dead! But he says this man is his
father!"

515
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,720
The father smiled again."

516
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:57,320
These young people!" he said. They think they know everything. But really it's my son who's always getting into
trouble. I have to look after him all the time, you know."

517
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
People

518
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,200
were beginning to go home.

519
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,520
I remembered that the hitch-hiker didn't have a car.

520
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,000
"Can I give you another lift back into town?" I asked.

521
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,200
"Yes, please," he said.

522
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,960
"That would be very kind. I... I'm getting old, you know. I
get tired when I see too many people."

523
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,720
The son smiled, and left us.

524
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,640
We walked to the car.

525
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,400
I didn't speak much.

526
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,680
I was thinking hard.

527
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,200
What questions should I ask?

528
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,040
The hitch-hiker got into the car and smiled at me.

529
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,480
"I hope we won't see another accident," he said.

530
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:42,280
"I hate accidents. All my life, I've been afraid of cars. I'm so glad that Michael isn't going to work near cars or
roads. He's got a job in a bookshop, you know, and he'll be

531
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,360
able to walk to work. You can't be farther away from cars
than that."

532
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,400
"Yes," I said.

533
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,160
It didn't sound very exciting to me.

534
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,160
"Is this job in Lancaster?"

535
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,800
"Oh, yes, of course." The man smiled his thin, pale smile.

536
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,000
"He doesn't want to work anywhere else. He comes to see me
every day, you know."

537
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,800
"When I met you the other day, where had you been?" I asked.

538
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,240
"With Michael, of course," he said.

539
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,360
"At the University."

540
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,640
"How did you get there?"

541
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,680
"I walked. It was a nice day."

542
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,320
"Did you cross the road about ten minutes before you met
me?" I asked.

543
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,960
"Did you walk in front of a car, perhaps?"

544
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,200
He looked surprised and unhappy.

545
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:34,280
"No... no, of course I didn't."

546
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:45,200
"Are you sure? Quite sure? Because the driver of one of the
cars saw you, you know."

547
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,960
"Saw me? What do you mean?"

548
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,080
"One of the drivers in that

549
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:58,520
accident saw a man, just like you, who walked straight across the road in front of him. That's why he swerved and
stopped. He thought he'd killed you!"

550
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,120
The man's fingers were playing nervously with the seat-belt,
and his face was whiter than ever.

551
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:10,600
"Oh, no. That isn't true. I was very careful, and anyway,
nobody can see me when..."

552
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,320
"So you did cross the road?" We were near the centre of the
town now, just outside the cemetery.

553
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,760
I stopped the car and turned to look at the man more
closely.

554
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:25,280
"I think you'd better come back to the police station with
me. I've got a few more questions to ask, Mr..."

555
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
But then I remembered.

556
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,920
I still didn't know his name.

557
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,560
"It's... er... David. David Holland," he said.

558
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,080
He was still playing nervously with the seat-belt while he
spoke.

559
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,240
"But I'm afraid I can't come to the police station. Thank
you for the lift. I must go now. Goodbye."

560
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,280
I tried to stop him, but he was going already.

561
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,960
Going in a way that was not normal at all.

562
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,920
He had not opened the door, but his leg and half of his body
were already halfway through it.

563
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,520
I couldn't speak, I was too surprised.

564
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:07,040
And as I watched, the other parts of his body - that thin, pale body in the strange, old-fashioned clothes - went
through the door as well.

565
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,560
Through the door, right through the steel car door.

566
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:18,320
And then he walked quickly away, and walked straight through
the closed metal gate into the cemetery.

567
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,040
I didn't see where he went.

568
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,320
I was too shocked to move.

569
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,880
When at last I got out of the car, and walked into the
cemetery, he was not there.

570
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,120
But there were fresh flowers on the grave under the
gravestone that said:

571
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,240
David Holland

572
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,160
1953-1978

573
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,040
"He gave his life for his son"

574
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,320
I stood by the grave and thought for a long

575
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,760
time.

576
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,600
But I'm only an ordinary policewoman.

577
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,760
I can't arrest dead people, or people who aren't there.

578
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:58,400
I remembered the things poor Mr Jackson had said to me when he left my office, and I wondered what on earth I was going
to do now.
