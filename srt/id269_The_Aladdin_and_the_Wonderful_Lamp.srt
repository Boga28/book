CHAPTER ONE

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,560
The Evil Magician

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:34,240
A long time ago, there lived a lazy boy named Aladdin.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,720
He would play with his friends all day long.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
Aladdin's mother was upset about her son.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,240
She would cry and pray.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,040
She wanted her son to change his behavior.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,800
However, Aladdin never changed.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,240
One day, a man came to Aladdin and asked, "Are you
Mustapha's son?"

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,920
"I am," answered Aladdin, "but he died long ago."

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
The stranger kissed Aladdin when he heard this.

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:19,400
He said, "I am your uncle. I thought you might look like my
brother. Go home, and tell your mother that I am coming."

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,960
Aladdin ran home and told his mother.

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:30,280
"Yes, your father had a brother," his mother said, "but I
thought he was dead."

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,080
She prepared some food.

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,680
His uncle came to their house.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:45,360
He spoke to Aladdin's mother, "Please don't be surprised. You don't know me. I was living in another country for forty
years."

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,720
Aladdin took him all around the city.

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,160
They looked at all of the sights together.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,880
His uncle bought Aladdin some beautiful clothes.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,040
"Aladdin, I have something to tell you," said the uncle.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,960
"I'm your uncle, but I'm also a magician."

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,400
Aladdin was excited to hear this.

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:25,600
The next day, the magician took Aladdin to a valley between
two big mountains.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,040
"I will show you something fantastic," said his uncle.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,600
The magician said the magic word "Abracadabra!"

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,960
The earth shook in front of them.

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,240
Magically, a brass ring appeared.

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:53,160
"Under the brass ring is a treasure. It will be yours. But
you must do exactly what I tell you."

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,280
When Aladdin heard the word "treasure", he was no longer
afraid.

33
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,720
"Pick up the ring," said the magician.

34
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,600
"Now say the name of your father."

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,920
Aladdin did as he was told.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
The ring opened a door.

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
Some steps appeared.

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,640
"Go down into the cave," said the magician.

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,640
"There you will see a lamp. Pick it up, and bring it to me."

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,680
Aladdin went down into the cave.

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,920
He found a lamp in a garden.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,440
He picked it up and took it to the entrance of the cave.

43
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,880
"Hurry! Give me the lamp," shouted the magician.

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,120
"I'll give it to you when I'm out of the cave," replied
Aladdin.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,200
The magician became very angry.

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
He said some magic words.

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
The door closed.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:54,000
The man wasn't really Aladdin's uncle.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,320
He was an evil magician.

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,480
He picked Aladdin to use him.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,680
He planned to kill Aladdin after he got the lamp.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,200
Aladdin stayed in the dark cave for two days.

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,160
He rubbed his hands together to pray.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,400
While rubbing, he also rubbed the brass ring.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,120
A big genie appeared.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,760
"I'm the genie of the ring. I will grant all your wishes,"
said the genie.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,360
"Please, get me out of this cave." said Aladdin.

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,520
The earth opened, and magically Aladdin was outside.

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,880
Aladdin was so happy to be outside.

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,080
He ran home as fast as he could.

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,920
He told his mother what happened.

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,760
Aladdin showed her the lamp.

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,360
Now he was hungry, but there was no food.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
"I'll sell this lamp and buy some food," he said.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,080
The lamp was very dirty.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,240
Aladdin's mother began to clean it.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,320
She rubbed the dirt off, and another genie appeared out of
the lamp.

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,240
"What would you like?" said the genie.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,600
Aladdin's mother was so surprised that she fainted.

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,240
Aladdin grabbed the lamp.

71
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,800
"Bring me something to eat!" he demanded.

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:35,440
The genie returned with twelve silver plates filled with
meat.

73
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,480
"Please sell the lamp," his mother begged.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:52,520
"This genie is a devil!"

75
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:05,000
"No, I can't," said Aladdin.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,880
"We should keep this lamp. We will need it."

77
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
CHAPTER TWO

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,560
The Beautiful Princess

79
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,280
One day, the King talked to the people.

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:30,720
"Everyone should stay home. Keep your doors and windows closed. My daughter will travel to and from the bathhouse,"
ordered the King.

81
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,200
Aladdin was very curious.

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,040
He wanted to see the Princess' face.

83
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,560
Aladdin hid behind the door of the bathhouse.

84
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,720
He saw the Princess as she entered the bathhouse.

85
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,320
She was so beautiful, and he immediately fell in love with
her.

86
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,880
He went home and told his mother.

87
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,440
"I'm so in love with the Princess," he said.

88
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,080
"Please, mother, go to the King, and tell him I want to
marry the Princess," begged Aladdin.

89
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,440
The genie of the lamp gave them jewels.

90
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,200
Aladdin's mother packed the jewels in a napkin.

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,120
She went to the palace.

92
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,440
The King and his chief advisor were in a big hall.

93
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,440
She entered and stood at the door.

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,640
"I see a woman standing in front of the door," said the
King.

95
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,600
"Call her so I can find out what she wants."

96
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,560
Aladdin's mother bowed to the King.

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,720
"Stand up, good woman. What do you want from me?" asked the
King.

98
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,520
"My son, Aladdin, is in love with the Princess," she said.

99
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,120
"He said he would die if he couldn't marry the Princess."

100
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,880
"What do you have in the napkin?" asked the King.

101
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:01,080
"These are jewels for the King," she said as she opened the
napkin.

102
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,440
The King was surprised.

103
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,200
The jewels were very valuable.

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
He turned to his chief advisor.

105
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,600
"What do you think? Isn't this enough money to allow the
Princess and Aladdin to marry?"

106
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,200
The chief advisor wanted his son to marry the Princess.

107
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,600
"Please, wait three months before you agree to this
marriage," he begged.

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,360
He hoped his son could prepare a bigger present to give to
the King.

109
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,480
The King agreed.

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,120
The chief advisor had to hide his plan from Aladdin's
mother.

111
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,480
He said to her, "Your son can marry the Princess. So please
come again in three months."

112
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,560
Aladdin waited patiently for two months.

113
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,240
Then one day, his mother went to the city to buy food.

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,760
There was a big party.

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,080
"What is everyone celebrating?" she asked.

116
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,920
"You don't know?" was the answer.

117
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,040
"The chief advisor's son will marry the Princess tonight."

118
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,600
She ran and told Aladdin.

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,160
He was really upset at first.

120
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Then he thought about the lamp.

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,520
He rubbed it, and the genie appeared.

122
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,720
"What would you like?" said the genie.

123
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,880
"I want you to bring the bride and the bridegroom to me
tonight," replied Aladdin.

124
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,400
"As you wish," said the genie.

125
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,320
Aladdin then went to his room.

126
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,560
In it were the Princess and her new husband.

127
00:09:48,560 --> 00:10:00,240
"Take this man," said Aladdin to the genie, "and put him
outside in the cold. You can return him in the morning."

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,280
The genie took the chief advisor's son.

129
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,040
Aladdin was alone with the Princess.

130
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
"Don't be afraid," Aladdin said to her.

131
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,880
"You are my wife. Your father promised me. I will not hurt
you."

132
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,680
The next morning, the Princess told her father everything.

133
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,920
The King talked to the chief advisor's son.

134
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,720
"It's true," the son said.

135
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,080
"I love the Princess. But I would rather die than have
another night like that. I want to leave her."

136
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,720
The King granted his wish.

137
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
After the three months were over, Aladdin's mother went to
the palace.

138
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:53,840
The King said, "Good woman, tell your son that he is welcome
to marry my daughter."

139
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,760
She immediately went home and told Aladdin.

140
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,240
"Hurry. The King is waiting for you."

141
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,360
Aladdin called the genie.

142
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,520
"Build me the finest palace."

143
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,160
The palace was finished the next day.

144
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,240
Aladdin and the princess got married.

145
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,720
After the wedding, Aladdin took her to his palace.

146
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,880
Aladdin became the captain of the King's army.

147
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,280
He won several battles for the King.

148
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,800
He lived in peace and happiness for many years.

149
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,680
CHAPTER THREE

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:53,360
The Return of the Evil Magician

151
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:05,080
The evil magician was living far away in Africa.

152
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,960
He found out that Aladdin had escaped from the cave and that
he had married the Princess.

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,760
"He's using the genie's help," the magician said to himself.

154
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,200
"I will get that lamp. And I will make Aladdin poor again!

155
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,960
The magician bought a dozen lamps. He went to the palace.

156
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,640
"New lamps for old ones!" he cried.

157
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,680
Unluckily, Aladdin was hunting.

158
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,520
The Princess grabbed Aladdin's magic lamp when she heard
this.

159
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,240
"Please take this, and trade it with the old man," she
ordered a servant.

160
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,440
The servant gave the lamp to the magician.

161
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,560
"Please take your choice of lamps," he told her.

162
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:11,600
He then carried the lamp out of the city. He pulled out the
lamp and rubbed it. The genie appeared.

163
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:20,360
"Genie, take Aladdin's palace, the Princess, and me to a
quiet place in Africa," the magician ordered.

164
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,160
The next morning, the King looked out his window.

165
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
"Aladdin's palace is gone!" he screamed.

166
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,760
The King was angry.

167
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,080
"Bring Aladdin back," he ordered.

168
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,680
The soldiers found Aladdin and tied him up.

169
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
They carried him to the King.

170
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,000
"You're a cheat," said the King.

171
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,880
He then showed Aladdin the place where his palace was.

172
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,120
Aladdin was so surprised he couldn't say a word.

173
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,000
"Where

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,880
is your palace and my daughter?" demanded the King. "You
must find her, or you'll lose your head."

175
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,200
"Please, give me forty days," asked Aladdin.

176
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
"I'll find her."

177
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,760
The King agreed to Aladdin's wish.

178
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,360
Aladdin rubbed the brass ring on his finger.

179
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,880
The genie appeared.

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,480
"What do you want?" he asked.

181
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,480
"Bring back my wife and the palace," begged Aladdin.

182
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,720
"I cannot do this," said the genie.

183
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,480
"You must ask the genie of the lamp."

184
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:55,280
"Then take me to the palace." asked Aladdin.

185
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,520
Magically, Aladdin appeared under his wife's window in
Africa.

186
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,600
The Princess saw him and opened the window quickly.

187
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,360
"Aladdin," she cried, "I missed you so much."

188
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:20,320
"Princess," said Aladdin, "the lamp is magic. Please tell me
what happened to it. She told him that she had exchanged the lamp.

189
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,760
"Where is the lamp now?" said Aladdin.

190
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:35,320
"The evil man always carries it with him," answered the
Princess. "He wants me to forget about you and marry him.

191
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,640
If he sees you, he will try to hurt you."

192
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,760
"Don't worry," said Aladdin.

193
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,360
"Everything will be okay."

194
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,120
Then he went into town.

195
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
He bought some powder and returned to the Princess.

196
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:56,640
"Please do as I say," Aladdin said to the Princess.

197
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,920
She listened to Aladdin carefully.

198
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,680
When the magician came, the Princess greeted him warmly.

199
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:16,600
"Now I know that Aladdin is dead. I can no longer cry for him. Therefore, I would like to have dinner with you. Could
you please bring me some wine?"

200
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,600
The magician ran to get some wine.

201
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,480
The Princess quickly put the powder in her cup.

202
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:35,040
When the magician returned, she asked, "Please drink from my glass. And we can live happily ever after." She then
exchanged glasses with him.

203
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,400
The magician drank all of his wine and fell dead on the
floor.

204
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,880
The Princess then opened the door for Aladdin.

205
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
She hugged his neck.

206
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,680
Aladdin went immediately to the dead magician.

207
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,520
He took out the lamp.

208
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,240
He ordered the genie to return the palace.

209
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:04,200
In an instant, they were back home.

210
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,040
The King was crying over the loss of his daughter.

211
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,040
He then looked up and rubbed his eyes.

212
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,720
The palace had returned!

213
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Aladdin and his wife lived happily together.

214
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:45,480
He later became King when the Princess' father died.
