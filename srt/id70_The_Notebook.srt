00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:39,770
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,460
MIRACLES
WHO AM I?

3
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,399
And how, I wonder, will this story end?

4
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,841
The sun has come up and I am sitting by a
window that is foggy with the breath of a

5
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,249
life gone by.

6
00:00:54,249 --> 00:01:00,339
I'm a sight this morning: two shirts, heavy
pants, a scarf around my neck and a thick

7
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:16,579
sweater knitted by my daughter thirty birthdays
ago.

8
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:33,500
Still my body shivers with a cold that will
never go away, because I am eighty years old.

9
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,729
Eighty years.

10
00:01:35,729 --> 00:02:10,819
I wonder if this is how it is for everyone
my age.

11
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:15,150
I am nothing special, of this, I am sure.

12
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,819
I am a common man with common thoughts, and
I've led a common life.

13
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,530
There are no monuments dedicated to me and
my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved

14
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:33,890
another with all my heart and soul, and to
me this has always been enough.

15
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,810
The romantics would call this a love story;
the cynics would call it a tragedy.

16
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,901
In my mind it's a little bit of both, and
no matter how you choose to view it in the

17
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:49,049
end, it does not change the fact that it involves
a great deal of my life.

18
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:55,379
I have no complaints about the path I have
chosen to follow and the places it has taken

19
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:02,750
me - the path has always been the right one.

20
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:42,220
I cough, and 
through squinted eyes, I check my watch.

21
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,940
I realize it is time to go.

22
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,269
I stand and shuffle across the room stopping
at the desk to pick up the notebook I have

23
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,840
read a hundred times.

24
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,959
I put it beneath my arm and continue on my
way to the place I must go.

25
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,360
I walk on tiled floors.

26
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,150
I'm the only one in the hallway this morning.

27
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,820
They are in their rooms, alone except for
television, but they, like me, are used to

28
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
it.

29
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,610
A person can get used to anything, if there
is enough time.

30
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,570
I hear the sounds of crying in the distance
and know who is making them.

31
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:41,060
The nurses see me, and we smile and exchange
greetings.

32
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,930
I am sure they wonder about me and the things
that I go through every day.

33
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,250
I listen as they begin to whisper among themselves
when I pass.

34
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,010
"There he goes again."

35
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,010
I hear.

36
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,240
"I hope it turns out well."

37
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:06,030
But they say nothing directly to me about
it.

38
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,630
A minute later, I reach the room.

39
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,640
The door is open for me, as usual.

40
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,190
There are two nurses in the room, and as I
enter they say "Good morning" with cheery

41
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,920
voices, and I take a moment to ask about the
kids and the schools and upcoming vacations.

42
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,640
We talk above the crying for a minute or so.

43
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,070
It seems they do not notice it: they have
become numb to it, and so have I.

44
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,630
Afterwards I sit in the chair.

45
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:45,640
They are finishing up now; her clothes are
on, but she is crying.

46
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,660
It will become quieter after they leave.

47
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,890
I know.

48
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:55,470
The excitement of the morning always upsets
her, and today is no exception.

49
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,960
Finally, the nurses walk out.

50
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,620
Both of them touch me and smile as they walk
by.

51
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,010
I sit for just a second and stare at her,
but she doesn't return the look.

52
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,380
I understand, for she doesn't know who I am.

53
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,510
I'm a stranger to her.

54
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:31,370
Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray
silently for the strength I know 

55
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,530
I will need.

56
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,690
Ready now.

57
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:55,940
On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes
a magnifier.

58
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:04,830
There is always a moment right before I begin
to read the story when I wonder if it will

59
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,230
happen today.

60
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:11,750
I don't know, for I never know beforehand
and deep down it really doesn't matter.

61
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,970
It's the possibility that keeps me going.

62
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:28,990
And though you may call me a dreamer or a
fool, I believe that anything is possible.

63
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,650
I realize that science is against me.

64
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,300
But science is not the total answer.

65
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,990
This I know, this I have learned in my lifetime.

66
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,120
And that leaves me with the belief that miracles,
no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable,

67
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,130
are real and can occur without regard to the
natural order of things.

68
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,240
So once again, just as I do every day, I begin
to read the notebook aloud, so that she can

69
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,460
hear it, in the hope that the miracle that
has come to dominate my life will once again

70
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,270
prevail.

71
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,280
And maybe, just maybe, it will.

72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
CHAPTER TWO

73
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:16,710
GHOSTS
IT 

74
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:23,810
WAS EARLY October 1946, and Noah Calhoun watched
the fading sun sink lower from the porch of

75
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,860
his plantation style home.

76
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,890
He liked to sit here in the evenings, especially
after working hard all day, and let his thoughts

77
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,200
wander.

78
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:56,540
It was how he relaxed, a routine he'd learned
from his father.

79
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:05,709
The house 
was built in 1772.

80
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,839
It was one of the oldest, as well as largest,
homes in New Bern.

81
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,269
Originally, it was the main house on a working
plantation, and he had bought it right after

82
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:21,480
the war ended and had spent the last eleven
months and a small fortune repairing it.

83
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,060
The reporter from the Raleigh paper had done
an article on it a few weeks ago and said

84
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,389
it was one of the finest restorations he'd
ever seen.

85
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,530
At least the house was.

86
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:55,500
The rest of the property was another story,
and that was where Noah had spent most 

87
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,899
of the day.

88
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:09,040
He'd gone into the house, drunk a glass of
sweet tea, then showered; the water was washing

89
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,980
away dirt and fatigue.

90
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,810
Afterwards he'd combed his hair back, put
on some faded jeans and a long-sleeved blue

91
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:24,410
shirt, poured himself another glass of tea
and gone to the porch, where he sat every

92
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,930
day at this time.

93
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,550
He reached for his guitar, remembering his
father as he did so, thinking how much he

94
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,580
missed him.

95
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,579
He hummed at first, then began to sing as
night came down around him.

96
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,860
It was a little after seven when he stopped
and settled back into his rocking chair.

97
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,830
By habit, he looked upwards and saw Orion,
the Big Dipper and the Pole Star, twinkling

98
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,160
in the autumn sky.

99
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,759
Clem, his dog, came up to him and lay down
at his feet.

100
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,529
He was thirty-one now, not too old, but old
enough to be lonely.

101
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:01,959
He hadn't dated since he'd been back here,
hadn't met anyone who remotely interested

102
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:02,959
him.

103
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,820
It was his own fault, he knew.

104
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,430
There was something that kept a distance between
him and any woman who started to get close,

105
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,649
something he wasn't sure he could change even
if he tried.

106
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,170
And sometimes, in the moments before sleep,
he wondered if he was destined to be alone

107
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,170
forever.

108
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,170
He smiled to himself.

109
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,779
He was glad he'd come back.

110
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,529
Though he'd been away for fourteen years,
this was home and he knew a lot of people

111
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,589
here, most of them from his youth.

112
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,589
It wasn't surprising.

113
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,279
Like so many southern towns, the people who
lived here never changed, they just grew a

114
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,279
bit older.

115
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,410
His best friend these days was Gus, a seventy-year-old
black man who lived down the road.

116
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,959
They had met a couple of weeks after Noah
bought the house, when Gus had shown up with

117
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:54,620
some homemade liquor and stew, and the two
had spent their first evening together getting

118
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,399
drunk and telling stories.

119
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,170
Now Gus showed up a couple of nights a week,
usually around eight.

120
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:12,800
With four kids and eleven grandchildren in
the house, he needed to get out now and then,

121
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
and Noah couldn't blame him.

122
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,589
Usually Gus brought his harmonica and, after
talking for a little while, they played a

123
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:19,760
few songs together.

124
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,500
He'd come to regard Gus as family.

125
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,980
There really wasn't anyone else, at least
not since his father died last year.

126
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,029
He was an only child and his mother had died
of influenza when he was two.

127
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,629
And though he had wanted to at one time, he
had never married.

128
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:49,499
But he had been 
in love once, that he knew.

129
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:52,399
Once and only once, and a long time ago.

130
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,810
And it had changed him forever.

131
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,490
Perfect love did that to a person, and this
had been perfect.

132
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:13,189
It was just after graduation 1932, the opening
night of the Neuse River Festival.

133
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:17,269
The town was enjoying barbecues and games
of chance.

134
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:23,760
He arrived alone, and as he strolled through
the crowd, looking for friends, he saw Fin

135
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:32,259
and Sarah, two people he'd grown up with,
talking to a girl he'd never seen before.

136
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,259
She was pretty.

137
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:38,370
When he finally joined them, she looked his
way with a pair of hazy eyes.

138
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,880
"Hi," she said simply as she offered her hand.

139
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,850
"Finley's told me a lot about you."

140
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,509
An ordinary beginning.

141
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:52,510
But as he shook her hand and met those striking
emerald eyes, he knew before he'd taken his

142
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,759
next breath that she was the only one he could
spend the rest of his life with.

143
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,610
She seemed that good, that perfect.

144
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,069
From there, it went like a tornado wind.

145
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:07,379
Fin told him she was spending the summer in
New Bern with her family, because her father

146
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,930
worked for a tobacco firm.

147
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,100
Sarah suggested getting some cherry cokes,
and the four of them stayed at the festival

148
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,220
until the crowds were thin and everything
closed up for the night.

149
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,059
They met the following day, and the day after
that, and they soon became inseparable.

150
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:26,199
Every morning but Sunday, when he had to go
to church, he finished his chores as quickly

151
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:33,199
as possible, then went to the park, where
she was waiting for him.

152
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:45,779
Because she was a newcomer and hadn't lived
in a small town before, they spent their days

153
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,779
doing things that were completely new to her.

154
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,790
He taught her how to fish.

155
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,329
They rode in canoes and watched summer thunderstorms,
and it seemed as though they'd always known

156
00:14:58,329 --> 00:14:59,329
each other.

157
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,329
But he learned things as well.

158
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:05,379
At the town dance, it was she who taught him
how to waltz and do the Charleston.

159
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:12,089
Later in the summer, he brought her to this
house, and told her that one day he was going

160
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,680
to own it and fix it up.

161
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,630
They spent hours together talking about their
dreams - his of seeing the world, hers of

162
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,630
being an artist.

163
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,960
On a humid night in August, they both lost
their virginity.

164
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,490
When she left three weeks later, she took
a piece of him and the rest of summer with

165
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,490
her.

166
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,890
He watched her leave town on an early rainy
morning then went home and packed a bag.

167
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,850
He spent the next week alone on a small island.

168
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,170
Noah checked his watch.

169
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,170
Eight twelve.

170
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,790
He got up, walked to the front of the house
and looked up the road.

171
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,119
Gus wasn't in sight, and Noah thought he wouldn't
come.

172
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,769
He went back and sat again.

173
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:56,509
He remembered how he had talked to Gus about
her.

174
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,119
The first time he mentioned her Gus started
to shake his head and laugh.

175
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,439
"So that's the ghost you've been running from."

176
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,819
When asked what he meant, Gus said, "You know,
the ghost, the memory.

177
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:09,860
I've been watching you working day and night,
so hard you barely have time to catch your

178
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
breath.

179
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,519
People do that for three reasons.

180
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,760
Either they are crazy, or stupid, or trying
to forget.

181
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,490
And with you, I knew you were trying to forget.

182
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,559
I just didn't know what."

183
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,619
Gus was right, of course.

184
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:35,689
New Bern was haunted now.

185
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,279
Haunted by the ghost of her memory.

186
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,829
He saw her in the park, their place, every
time he walked by.

187
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:50,379
When he sat on the porch at night with his
guitar, he saw her beside him, listening as

188
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,619
he played the music of his childhood.

189
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:59,649
Everywhere he looked, he saw things that brought
her back to life.

190
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:07,950
EARLIER THAT evening and a hundred miles away,
she sat alone on the porch swing of her parents'

191
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,580
home, wondering if she'd made the right decision.

192
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:16,580
She'd struggled with it for days, but in the
end she knew she would never forgive herself

193
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,230
if she let the opportunity slip away.

194
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,900
Lon didn't know the real reason she left the
following morning.

195
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,400
The week before, she'd hinted to him that
she might want to visit some antique shops

196
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,660
near the coast.

197
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,290
"It's just a couple of days," she said, "and
besides, I need a break from planning the

198
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,290
wedding."

199
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:48,950
She felt bad about the lie, but knew there
was no way she could tell him the truth.

200
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,990
Her leaving had nothing to do with him, and
it wouldn't be fair of her to ask him to understand.

201
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,810
It was an easy drive from Raleigh, slightly
more than two hours, and she arrived a little

202
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,810
before eleven.

203
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:08,370
She checked into a small inn downtown, went
to her room and unpacked her suitcase, hanging

204
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:14,680
her dresses in the closet and putting everything
else in the drawers.

205
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,340
She had a quick lunch, asked the waitress
for directions to the nearest antique stores,

206
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,710
then spent the next few hours shopping.

207
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,060
By four thirty, she was back in her room.

208
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,490
She sat on the edge of the bed, picked up
the phone and called Lon.

209
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,740
He couldn't speak long, but before they hung
up she gave him the phone number where she

210
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,480
was staying and promised to call the following
day.

211
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,010
Good, she thought while hanging up the phone.

212
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,550
Routine conversation, nothing out of the ordinary.

213
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,600
Nothing to make him suspicious.

214
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,900
She'd known him almost four years now, it
was 1942 when they met, the world at war and

215
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,160
America one year in.

216
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,360
She was volunteering at the hospital downtown.

217
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,370
The first waves of wounded young soldiers
were coming home, and she spent her days with

218
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,370
broken men.

219
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,280
When Lon, with his easy charm, introduced
himself at a party, she saw in him exactly

220
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,110
what she needed: someone with confidence about
the future and a sense of humour that drove

221
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,130
all her fears away.

222
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,410
He was handsome and intelligent, a successful
lawyer eight years older than she, and he

223
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,500
pursued his job with passion, not only winning
cases but also making a name for himself.

224
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,980
She understood his vigorous pursuit of success,
for her father and most of the men she met

225
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,700
in her social circle were the same way.

226
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,750
In the caste system of the South, family name
and accomplishments were often the most important

227
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,750
consideration in marriage.

228
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,410
In some cases, they were the only consideration.

229
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,600
Lon was a gentleman, mature and responsible,
and during those terrible periods of the war

230
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,740
when she needed someone to hold her, he never
once turned her away.

231
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,110
She felt secure with him and knew he loved
her as well and that was why she had accepted

232
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,110
his proposal.

233
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,450
Thinking these things made her feel guilty
about being here, and she knew she should

234
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,590
pack her things and leave before she changed
her mind.

235
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,330
She picked up her handbag, hesitated and almost
walked to the door.

236
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,900
But coincidence had pushed her here, and she
put the bag down, again realizing that if

237
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,920
she quit now she would always wonder what
would have happened.

238
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,750
She couldn't live with that.

239
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,740
She went to the bathroom and started a bath.

240
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,350
After checking the temperature, she undressed
and looked at herself in the mirror.

241
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,320
Her body was firm and well proportioned.

242
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,190
She'd inherited her mother's high cheekbones,
smooth skin and blonde hair, but her best

243
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,890
feature was her own.

244
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,570
She had "eyes like ocean waves", as Lon liked
to say.

245
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:41,571
She liked the way a bath relaxed her, and
she slipped lower in the water.

246
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:46,500
The day had been long and her back was tense,
but she was pleased she had finished shopping

247
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
so quickly.

248
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,650
She had to go back to Raleigh with something
tangible, and the things she had picked out

249
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,270
would be fine.

250
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:02,680
She made a mental note to find the names of
some other stores in the area, then suddenly

251
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,290
doubted she would need to.

252
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,670
Lon wasn't the type to check up on her.

253
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,020
She soaked a while longer in the bath before
finally getting out.

254
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:18,030
She went to the closet and looked for a dress,
finally choosing a light blue one, buttoned

255
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,710
up at the front.

256
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:26,450
She wore little make-up, just a touch of eye
shadow and mascara to accent her eyes.

257
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,550
Perfume next, not too much.

258
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:34,410
She found a pair of small-hooped earrings,
put those on, then slipped on the low-heeled

259
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,430
sandals she had been wearing earlier.

260
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,010
She brushed her blonde hair and let it back
down.

261
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,190
When she was finished, she stepped back and
evaluated herself.

262
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,050
She looked good: not too dressy, not too casual.

263
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,960
She didn't want to overdo it.

264
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,360
After all, she didn't know what to expect.

265
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,700
It had been a long time - probably too long.

266
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,130
She found her handbag and car keys, then picked
up the room key.

267
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:07,510
She turned it over in her hand a couple of
times, thinking - "You've come this far, don't

268
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,880
give up now."

269
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,180
She nearly left then, but instead sat on the
bed again.

270
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,770
She checked her watch.

271
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,320
Almost six o'clock.

272
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,490
She knew she had to leave in a few minutes
- she didn't want to arrive after dark - but

273
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,650
she needed a little more time.

274
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,730
"Damn," she whispered.

275
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,530
"What am I doing here?

276
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,970
I shouldn't be here.

277
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,770
There's no reason for it."

278
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,380
But once she said it she knew it wasn't true.

279
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,340
She opened her handbag and found a folded-up
piece of newspaper.

280
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:46,020
After taking it out slowly, almost respectfully,
she unfolded it and stared at it for a while.

281
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,950
"This is why," she finally said to herself,
"this is what it's all about."

282
00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:00,890
NOAH GOT UP at five and kayaked for an hour
up the river, as he usually did.

283
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,660
When he finished, he changed into his work
clothes, warmed some bread rolls from the

284
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,760
day before, grabbed a couple of apples and
washed his breakfast down with two cups of

285
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
coffee.

286
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,970
He continued repairing the posts.

287
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,200
It was an Indian summer, the temperature over
eighty degrees, and by lunchtime he was hot

288
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,470
and tired and glad of the break.

289
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,950
He ate at the river because the fish were
jumping.

290
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,560
He liked to watch them jump three or four
times and glide through the air before they

291
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,240
vanished into the brackish water.

292
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,210
He stopped working a little after three and
walked to a small shed that sat near his dock.

293
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:49,820
He went in, found his fishing pole, some live
crickets, then walked out to the dock, baited

294
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,450
his hook and cast his line.

295
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,470
Fishing always made him reflect on his life,
and he did so now.

296
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,850
After his mother died, he could remember spending
his days in a dozen different homes.

297
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,430
For one reason or another, he stuttered badly
as a child and was teased for it.

298
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:12,110
He began to speak less and less, and by the
age of five, he didn't want to speak at all.

299
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:18,330
When he started classes, his teachers thought
he was retarded and recommended that his father

300
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,410
take him out of school.

301
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,140
Instead, his father took matters into his
own hands.

302
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,010
He kept him in school and afterwards made
him come to the timber yard where he worked,

303
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
to stack wood.

304
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,770
"It's good that we spend some time together,"
he said as they worked side- by-side, "just

305
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,010
like my daddy and I did."

306
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:45,280
His father talked about animals or told stories
and legends common to North Carolina.

307
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,910
Within a few months, Noah was speaking again,
though not well, and his father decided to

308
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,640
teach him to read with books of poetry.

309
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:04,200
"Learn to read this aloud and you'll be able
to say anything you want to."

310
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,050
His father had been right again, and by the
following year, Noah had lost his stutter.

311
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:16,710
But he continued going to the timber yard
every day simply because his father was there,

312
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:25,010
and in the evenings he read the works of Whitman
and Tennyson aloud as his father rocked beside

313
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,010
him.

314
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,340
He had been reading poetry ever since.

315
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,740
When he got a little older, he spent most
of his weekends and vacations alone.

316
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,930
Camping and exploring became his passion,
and he spent hours in the forest, whistling

317
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,670
quietly and playing his guitar for wild animals.

318
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:48,450
Poets knew that isolation in nature, far from
people and things man-made, was good for the

319
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,580
soul, and he'd always identified with poets.

320
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:57,070
Although he was quiet, years of heavy lifting
at the timber yard helped him become good

321
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,000
at sports, and his athletic success led to
popularity.

322
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,820
He enjoyed the football and track meets, and,
though most of his teammates spent their free

323
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,710
time together as well, he rarely joined them.

324
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:15,500
He had a few girlfriends in school but none
had ever made an impression on him.

325
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,580
Except for one.

326
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,060
And she came after graduation.

327
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
Allie.

328
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
His Allie.

329
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,390
Most of the summer Allie had to make excuses
to her parents whenever they wanted to see

330
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,390
each other.

331
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,760
It wasn't that they didn't like him - it was
that he was from a different class, too poor,

332
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,350
and they would never approve if their daughter
became serious with someone like him.

333
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,940
"I don't care what my parents think, I love
you and always will," she said.

334
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,530
"We'll find a way to be together."

335
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,450
But in the end they couldn't.

336
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,180
By early September, the tobacco had been harvested
and she had no choice but to return with her

337
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
family to Winston-Salem.

338
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,390
"Only the summer is over, Allie, not us,"
he'd said the morning she left.

339
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,300
"We'll never be over."

340
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,420
But they were.

341
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,570
For a reason he didn't understand, the letters
he wrote went unanswered.

342
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,370
He decided to leave New Bern to help get her
off his mind.

343
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,740
He went to New Jersey.

344
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,260
He found a job in a scrap yard, separating
scrap metal from everything else.

345
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,210
The owner, Morris Goldman, was convinced that
a war was going to start in Europe and that

346
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,650
America would be dragged in again.

347
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,880
Noah didn't care.

348
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,960
He was just happy to have a job.

349
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,680
He worked hard.

350
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,670
It helped him keep his mind off Allie during
the day, and it was something he felt he had

351
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,670
to do.

352
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,880
His daddy had always said, "Give a day's work
for a day's pay.

353
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,350
Anything less is stealing."

354
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,180
That attitude pleased his boss.

355
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,390
He thought about Allie at night.

356
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,580
He wrote to her once a month but never received
a reply.

357
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,780
Eventually he wrote one final letter and forced
himself to accept the fact that the summer

358
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,800
they'd spent with one another was the only
thing they'd ever share.

359
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,440
For the next eight years, he worked for Goldman.

360
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,650
As the years dragged on, the company grew
and he was promoted.

361
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,690
By 1940, he had mastered the business and
was running the entire operation, managing

362
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,230
a staff of thirty.

363
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,490
The yard had become the largest scrap-metal
dealer on the east coast.

364
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,470
During that time, he dated a few different
women.

365
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:27,750
He became serious with one, a waitress from
the local cafe with deep blue eyes and silky

366
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,750
black hair.

367
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,130
Although they dated for two years and had
many good times together, he never came to

368
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,840
feel the same way about her as he did about
Allie.

369
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,990
Towards the end of their relationship she'd
told him once, "I wish I could give you what

370
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,100
you're looking for, but I don't know what
it is.

371
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,540
There's a part of you that you keep closed
off from everyone, including me.

372
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,990
It's like your mind is on someone else and
you keep waiting for her to take you away

373
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,990
from all this..."

374
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,460
A month later, she visited him at work and
told him she'd met someone else.

375
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,460
He understood.

376
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,870
They parted as friends, and the following
year he received a postcard from her saying

377
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,870
she was married.

378
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,870
He hadn't heard from her since.

379
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:12,380
In December 1941, when he was twenty-six,
the war began, just as Goldman had predicted.

380
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:18,130
Noah walked into his office the following
month and informed Goldman of his intention

381
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,320
to join the army, then returned to New Bern
to say goodbye to his father.

382
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,460
Five weeks later, he was in training camp.

383
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,280
While there, he received a letter from Goldman
thanking him for his work, together with a

384
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,100
copy of a certificate giving him the right
to get a small percentage of the scrap yard

385
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,770
if it was ever sold.

386
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,790
He spent his next three years with Patton's
Third Army, tramping through deserts in North

387
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,180
Africa and forests in Europe.

388
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,510
He watched his friends die around him; watched
as some of them were buried thousands of miles

389
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,510
from home.

390
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,150
He remembered the war ending in Europe, then
a few months later in Japan.

391
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,720
Just before he was discharged, he received
a letter from a lawyer in New Jersey representing

392
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Morris Goldman.

393
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:04,950
When he met the lawyer, he found out that
Goldman had died a year earlier and his estate

394
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,060
had been liquidated.

395
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,140
The business had been sold, and Noah was given
a cheque for almost seventy thousand dollars.

396
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,830
The following week he returned to New Bern
and bought the house.

397
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,950
He remembered bringing his father around later,
pointing out the changes, he intended to make.

398
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,690
His father seemed weak as he walked, coughing.

399
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,490
Noah was concerned, but his father told him
not to worry, assuring him that he had the

400
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,490
flu.

401
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,530
Less than one month later, his father died
of pneumonia and was buried next to his wife

402
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,530
in the local cemetery.

403
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,840
Noah tried to stop by regularly to leave some
flowers.

404
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,390
And every night he took a moment to say a
prayer for the man who'd taught him everything

405
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,390
that mattered.

406
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,170
SOON HE went back to the house.

407
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,970
He got into his old Dodge truck and went to
see Gus.

408
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,650
He always stopped there when he was going
to the store, because Gus's family didn't

409
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,880
have a car.

410
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,690
One of the daughters hopped up and rode with
him, and they did their shopping.

411
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,420
When he got home, he didn't unpack the groceries
right away.

412
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:20,320
Instead, he showered, found a Budweiser and
a book of poetry, and went to sit on the porch.

413
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,330
SHE STILL did not believe it, even as she
held the proof in her hands.

414
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:32,760
It had been in the newspaper at her parents'
house three Sundays ago.

415
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:40,530
She had gone to the kitchen to get a cup of
coffee, and when she'd returned to the table

416
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,760
her father had smiled and pointed at a small
picture.

417
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
"Remember this?"

418
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,440
He handed her the paper and, after an uninterested
first glance, something in the picture caught

419
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,110
her eye and she took a closer look.

420
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,420
"It can't be," she whispered, and when her
father looked at her curiously, she ignored

421
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,610
him, sat down and read the article without
speaking.

422
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:12,510
She vaguely remembered her mother coming to
the table and sitting opposite her, and when

423
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:18,170
she finally put aside the paper, her mother
was staring at her.

424
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,370
"Are you okay?"

425
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,370
she asked over her coffee cup.

426
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,370
"You look a little pale."

427
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:36,220
Allie didn't answer right away, she couldn't,
and then she noticed that her hands were shaking.

428
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,100
So it started.

429
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:48,580
"And here it will end, one way or the other,"
she whispered again.

430
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,780
She refolded the piece of paper and put it
back.

431
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:00,030
And now, after three weeks of long walks alone,
after three weeks of distraction, it was the

432
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,580
reason she'd come.

433
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:07,980
When asked, she said her strange behaviour
was due to stress.

434
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:17,590
It was the perfect excuse; everyone understood,
including Lon, and that's why he hadn't argued

435
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:24,310
when she'd wanted to get away for a couple
of days.

436
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,590
The wedding plans were stressful to everyone
involved.

437
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,080
Almost five hundred people were invited, including
the governor, one senator and the ambassador

438
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,220
to Peru.

439
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:39,840
It was too much, in her opinion, but their
engagement was news and had dominated the

440
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,360
social pages since they had announced their
plans six months ago.

441
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,920
She took a deep breath and stood again.

442
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,340
"It's now or never," she whispered, then picked
up her things and went to the door.

443
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,320
She went downstairs and went out to her car.

444
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,740
She slipped behind the wheel, started the
engine and turned right onto Front Street.

445
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,490
She still knew her way around the small town,
even though she hadn't been here in years.

446
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:08,419
A magnificent oak tree on the riverbank came
into view, and the memories became more intense.

447
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:11,810
She remembered sitting beneath the tree on
a hot July day with someone who looked at

448
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,859
her with a longing that took everything else
away.

449
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:18,030
And at that moment she'd first fallen in love.

450
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,500
He was two years older than she was.

451
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:30,379
He had the calloused hands and broad shoulders
that came to those who worked hard for a living

452
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,319
and the first faint lines were beginning to
form around dark eyes that seemed to read

453
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,319
her every thought.

454
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:42,659
He was tall and strong, with light brown hair,
and handsome in his own way, but most of all

455
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,539
she remembered his voice.

456
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:51,099
He had read to her that day as they lay beneath
the tree with an accent that was soft and

457
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,790
fluent, almost musical in quality.

458
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:58,680
She remembered closing her eyes, listening
closely and letting the words he was reading

459
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,760
touch her soul.

460
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,790
Another turn in the road and she finally saw
the house in the distance.

461
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,660
It had changed dramatically from what she
remembered.

462
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,099
She slowed the car, turning into the long,
tree- lined drive.

463
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,910
She took a deep breath when she saw him on
the porch, watching her car.

464
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,099
He was dressed casually.

465
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:23,170
From a distance, he looked the same as he
had back then.

466
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,180
Her car continued forward slowly, and then
finally stopped beneath an oak tree that shaded

467
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,920
the front of the house.

468
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,390
She turned the key, never taking her eyes
from him.

469
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,270
He stepped off the porch and started approaching
her, walking easily, then suddenly stopped

470
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,440
as she emerged from the car.

471
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,810
For a long time all they could do was stare
at each other without moving.

472
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,119
Allison Nelson, twenty-nine years old and
engaged, a socialite, searching for answers,

473
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:57,050
and Noah Calhoun, the dreamer, thirty-one,
visited by the ghost that had come to dominate

474
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,050
his life.

475
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,050
CHAPTER THREE

476
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,250
REUNION
NEITHER ONE of them moved as they faced each

477
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,250
other.

478
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,369
As she stared at him, she noticed how little
he had changed since she had last seen him.

479
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,380
He looked good, she thought.

480
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,349
He looked the same as he had when she had
known him last.

481
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:18,170
She took a deep breath and smiled.

482
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,170
"Hello, Noah.

483
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,390
It's good to see you again."

484
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,019
He looked at her with amazement in his eyes.

485
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,600
Then, after shaking his head slightly, he
slowly smiled.

486
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,030
"You too," he said.

487
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,810
"It's really you, isn't it?

488
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,240
I can't believe it..."

489
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:41,569
She felt something tremble inside, something
deep and old, something that made her dizzy

490
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:42,800
for just a second.

491
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,690
She caught herself fighting for control.

492
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,859
She hadn't expected this to happen, didn't
want it to happen.

493
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:50,980
She was engaged now.

494
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,690
She hadn't come here for this.

495
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,690
Yet.

496
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:59,490
Yet the feeling went on despite herself, and
for a brief moment, she felt fifteen again.

497
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,380
Felt as she hadn't in years, as if all her
dreams could still come true.

498
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,269
Felt as though she'd finally come home.

499
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:11,950
Without another word, they came together,
and he put his arms around her.

500
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,609
They held each other tightly; both of them
letting the fourteen years of separation dissolve

501
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,430
in the deepening twilight.

502
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:28,230
They stayed like that for a long time before
she finally pulled back to look at him.

503
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:34,210
Up close, she could see the changes she hadn't
noticed at first.

504
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,210
His face had lost the softness of youth.

505
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,210
The faint lines around his eyes had deepened.

506
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,520
There was a new edge to him; he seemed less
innocent, more cautious, and yet the way he

507
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,450
was holding her made her realize how much
she'd missed him.

508
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,859
"I still can't believe it's you.

509
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:47,680
How did you find me?" asked he.

510
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,490
She stepped back, trying to compose herself.

511
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:56,869
"I saw the story on the house in the Raleigh
paper a couple of weeks ago, and I had to

512
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:57,869
come and see you again."

513
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:58,869
Noah smiled broadly.

514
00:37:58,869 --> 00:37:59,869
"I'm glad you did."

515
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:00,869
He stepped back.

516
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:01,869
"You look fantastic.

517
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:05,180
You're even prettier now than you were then."

518
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,859
She felt the blood in her face.

519
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:07,869
Just like fourteen years ago.

520
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,869
"Thank you.

521
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,869
You look great, too."

522
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:10,869
And he did, no doubt about it.

523
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:11,869
"So why are you here?"

524
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:16,400
She turned away and took a deep breath, wondering
how to say it, and when she finally started,

525
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,850
her voice was quiet.

526
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,960
"Noah, before you get the wrong idea, I really
wanted to see you again, but there's more

527
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,420
to it than just that."

528
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,880
She paused for a second.

529
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,499
"I came here for a reason.

530
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,380
There's something I have to tell you."

531
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,880
"What is it?"

532
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,999
She looked away and didn't answer for a moment,
surprised that she couldn't tell him just

533
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:41,999
yet.

534
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,799
In the silence, Noah felt a sinking feeling
in his stomach.

535
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:46,410
Whatever it was, it was bad.

536
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,200
"I don't know how to say it.

537
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,980
I thought I did at first, but now I'm not
so sure..."

538
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,099
"What is it, Allie?"

539
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,720
"I'm rather silly, aren't I?" she asked, trying
to smile.

540
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,980
"What do you mean?"

541
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
"This whole thing.

542
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,079
Showing up suddenly, not knowing what I want
to say.

543
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,660
You must think I'm crazy."

544
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,119
"You're not crazy," he said gently.

545
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,549
He reached for her hand, and she let him hold
it as they stood next to one another.

546
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:17,200
He went on, "Even though I don't know why,
I can see this is hard for you.

547
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,280
Why don't we go for a walk?"

548
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,599
"Like we used to?"

549
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,599
"Why not?"

550
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,900
She hesitated and looked to his front door.

551
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,790
"Do you need to tell anyone?"

552
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,089
He shook his head.

553
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:28,710
"There's no one to tell.

554
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,980
It's just me and Clem, my dog."

555
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:36,230
Even though she had asked, she had suspected
there wouldn't be anyone else, and inside

556
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,549
she didn't know how to feel about that.

557
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:40,380
But it made what she wanted to say a little
harder.

558
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,630
They started towards the river and turned
onto a path near the bank.

559
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:49,809
She let go of his hand and walked on with
just enough distance between them so that

560
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:51,420
they couldn't accidentally touch.

561
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,789
He looked at her.

562
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:59,650
She was still pretty, with thick hair and
soft eyes, and she moved so gracefully.

563
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:06,799
He'd seen beautiful women before, women who
caught his eye, but to his mind, they usually

564
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:08,869
lacked the traits he found most desirable.

565
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:12,420
Traits like intelligence, confidence, strength
of spirit, passion, traits that inspired others

566
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
to greatness.

567
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:19,910
Allie had those traits, he knew, and as they
walked now he sensed them once again.

568
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,800
"How long have you been back here?"

569
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,000
she asked as the path gave way to a small
grass hill.

570
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,050
"Since last December.

571
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:37,299
I worked up north for a while, and then spent
the last three years in Europe."

572
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:40,180
She looked at him with questions in her eyes.

573
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
"The war?"

574
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,180
He nodded and she went on.

575
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,690
"I thought you might be there.

576
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,089
I'm glad it's finished."

577
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:46,480
"Me too," he said.

578
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,920
"Are you glad to be back home?"

579
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
"Yeah.

580
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
My roots are here.

581
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,589
This is where I'm supposed to be."

582
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:53,589
He paused.

583
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,589
"But what about you?"

584
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:56,529
He asked the question softly, suspecting the
worst.

585
00:40:56,529 --> 00:40:59,319
It was a long moment before she answered.

586
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:00,319
"I'm engaged."

587
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,210
He looked down when she said it, suddenly
feeling just a bit weaker.

588
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,900
So that was it.

589
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,470
That's what she needed to tell him.

590
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,500
"Congratulations," he finally said, wondering
how convincing he sounded.

591
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,349
"When's the big day?"

592
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,349
"Three weeks.

593
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:19,650
Lon wanted a November wedding."

594
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,650
"Lon?"

595
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,650
"Lon Hammond Junior.

596
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,650
My fiance."

597
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,650
He nodded.

598
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,390
The Hammonds were one of the most powerful
and influential families in the state.

599
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,390
Cotton money.

600
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,780
Unlike that of his own father, the death of
Lon Hammond Senior had made the front page

601
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,799
of the newspaper.

602
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,630
"I've heard of them.

603
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,369
His father built quite a business.

604
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,500
Did Lon take over for him?"

605
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,710
She shook her head.

606
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,930
"No, he's a lawyer.

607
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,450
He has his own practice."

608
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,579
"With his name, he must be busy."

609
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:45,579
"He is.

610
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:46,579
He works a lot."

611
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:50,589
He thought he heard something in her tone,
and the next question came automatically.

612
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:52,599
"Does he treat you well?"

613
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,599
She didn't answer right away, as if she were
considering the question for the first time.

614
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,690
Then she said, "Yes.

615
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,240
He's a good man, Noah.

616
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
You'd like him."

617
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,539
Her voice was distant when she answered, or
at least he thought it was.

618
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:11,109
Noah wondered if it was just his mind playing
tricks on him.

619
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:12,779
"How's your daddy doing?" she asked.

620
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:14,910
Noah took a couple of steps before answering.

621
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,039
"He passed on earlier this year, right after
I got back."

622
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,039
"I'm sorry," she said softly.

623
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,019
He nodded, and they walked on in silence.

624
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:23,440
They reached the top of the hill and stopped.

625
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,549
The oak tree was in the distance, with the
sun glowing orange behind it.

626
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:31,519
Allie could feel his eyes on her as she stared
in that direction.

627
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,960
"A lot of memories there, Allie."

628
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
She smiled.

629
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
"I know.

630
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,680
I saw it when I came in.

631
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,989
Do you remember the day we spent there?"

632
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,900
"Yes," he answered.

633
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,710
"Do you ever think about it?"

634
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,609
"Sometimes," he said.

635
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,190
"Usually when I'm working out this way.

636
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,549
It sits on my property now."

637
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:55,549
"You bought it?"

638
00:42:55,549 --> 00:43:00,240
"I just couldn't bear to see it turned into
kitchen cabinets."

639
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,970
She laughed under her breath, feeling strangely
pleased about that.

640
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:10,170
As the sun dropped a little lower and the
sky turned orange, he asked, "So, how long

641
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,170
are you staying?"

642
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,170
"I don't know.

643
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,170
Not long.

644
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,329
Maybe until tomorrow or the next day."

645
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:15,990
"Is your fiance here on business?"

646
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,200
"No, he's still in Raleigh."

647
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,489
Noah raised his eyebrows.

648
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:20,700
"Does he know you're here?"

649
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,660
She shook her head and answered slowly.

650
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,660
"No.

651
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
I told him I was looking for antiques.

652
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,660
He wouldn't understand my coming here."

653
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,660
Noah was a little surprised.

654
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,539
It was one thing to come and visit, but it
was an entirely different matter to hide the

655
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:32,049
truth from her fiance.

656
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:33,789
He asked, "Allie, do you love him?"

657
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:35,819
She answered automatically, "Yes, I love him."

658
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:36,819
The words hurt.

659
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:41,740
But again, he thought he heard something in
her tone, and decided she was saying it to

660
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,740
convince herself.

661
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,730
He stopped and gently took her shoulders in
his hands, making her face him.

662
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,489
The sunlight reflected in her eyes as he spoke.

663
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:54,809
"If you're happy, Allie, and you love him,
I won't try to stop you from going back to

664
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:55,809
him.

665
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:01,009
But if there's a part of you that isn't sure,
then don't do it.

666
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:04,930
This isn't the kind of thing you go into halfway."

667
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,660
Her answer came almost too quickly.

668
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,400
"I'm making the right decision, Noah."

669
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,490
He stared for a second, wondering if he believed
her.

670
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,390
Then he nodded and they began to walk again.

671
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,940
He said, "I'm not making this easy for you,
am I?"

672
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,230
She smiled a little.

673
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,230
"It's okay.

674
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,490
I really can't blame you."

675
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,490
"I'm sorry anyway."

676
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,490
"Don't be.

677
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,030
There's no reason to be sorry."

678
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,319
"I'm glad you came.

679
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,260
It's good to see you again.

680
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,230
You were the best friend I ever had, Allie.

681
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:43,880
I'd still like to be friends, even if you
are engaged, and even if it is just for a

682
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
couple of days.

683
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,520
How about getting to know each other again?"

684
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,540
She thought about it, and decided that since
he knew about her engagement, it would probably

685
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,540
be all right.

686
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,099
Or at least not wrong.

687
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,670
She smiled slightly and nodded.

688
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,920
"I'd like that."

689
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
"Good.

690
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
How about dinner?

691
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,049
I know a place that serves the best crab in
town."

692
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,049
"Sounds great.

693
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:06,049
Where?"

694
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:07,049
"My house.

695
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:12,039
I've had the traps out all week, and I saw
that I had some good ones caged a couple of

696
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:13,039
days ago.

697
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,039
Do you mind?"

698
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,039
"No, that sounds fine."

699
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:17,950
He smiled and pointed over his shoulder with
his thumb.

700
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:18,950
"Great.

701
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,950
They're at the dock.

702
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,049
I'll just be a couple of minutes."

703
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,359
A breeze broke the stillness and chilled her,
making her cross her arms.

704
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,780
She stood that way, until she heard him reach
her side.

705
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,480
She could feel his closeness, his warmth.

706
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,400
"It's so peaceful here," she said, and her
voice was dreamlike.

707
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
"I know.

708
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,210
I come down here a lot now just to be close
to the water.

709
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,210
It makes me feel good.

710
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,210
Come on, let's go.

711
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,029
The mosquitoes are getting vicious, and I'm
starved."

712
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:46,680
THE SKY had turned black and they started
towards the house.

713
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:54,690
Noah set the bucket by the door, and then
led the way inside to the kitchen.

714
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:59,369
It was on the right, large and smelling of
new wood.

715
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:05,269
The cabinets were made of oak, like the floor,
and the windows were large and faced east,

716
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,349
allowing the light from the morning sun.

717
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,490
"Do you mind if I look around?"

718
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,490
"No, go ahead.

719
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:14,670
I did some shopping earlier and I still have
to put the groceries away."

720
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,700
She toured the house for the next few minutes,
walking through the rooms, noticing how wonderful

721
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,700
it looked.

722
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,499
She came down the stairs, turned towards the
kitchen, and saw his profile.

723
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:30,680
For a second he looked like a young man of
seventeen again, and it made her pause a second

724
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,710
before going on.

725
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,069
"Damn," she thought, "get a hold of yourself.

726
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:36,079
Remember that you're engaged now."

727
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,079
"It's unbelievable, Noah.

728
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,539
How long did the restoration take?"

729
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:45,470
He looked up from the last bag he was unpacking.

730
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,700
"Almost a year."

731
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,630
"Did you do it all yourself?"

732
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,630
He laughed.

733
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,630
"No.

734
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,720
I always thought I would when I was young,
and I started that way.

735
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:03,200
But it was just too much, so I had to hire
some people... actually a lot of people.

736
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,849
But even with them it was still a lot of work,
and most of the time I didn't stop until past

737
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:11,849
midnight."

738
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:14,119
"Why did you work so hard?"

739
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:17,390
Ghosts, he wanted to say, but didn't.

740
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,799
"I don't know.

741
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:21,599
Just wanted to finish, I guess.

742
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,279
Do you want anything to drink before I start
dinner?"

743
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,150
"What do you have?"

744
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,559
"Not much, really.

745
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,960
Beer, tea, coffee."

746
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,359
"Tea sounds good."

747
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:38,660
He gathered the grocery bags and put them
away, then walked to a small room off the

748
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:49,569
kitchen before returning with a box of tea.

749
00:47:49,569 --> 00:48:00,220
He pulled out a couple of tea bags and put
them by the stove, then filled the kettle.

750
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:11,009
After putting it on the burner, he lit a match
and she heard the sound of flames as they

751
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:12,009
came to life.

752
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:15,589
"It'll be just a minute," he said, "this stove
heats up pretty quick."

753
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:16,589
"That's fine."

754
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:21,809
When the kettle whistled, he poured two cups
and handed one to her.

755
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:24,410
She smiled and took a sip.

756
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:30,700
"I'm going to get the crabs in to marinate
for a few minutes before I steam them," he

757
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,150
said, putting his cup on the counter.

758
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:45,729
He went to the cupboard and removed a large
pot with a steamer and lid.

759
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:50,589
He brought the pot to the sink, added water,
and then carried it to the stove.

760
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:51,829
"Can I help you?"

761
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,690
He answered over his shoulder, "Sure.

762
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,989
How about cutting up some vegetables to fry.

763
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:00,869
There's plenty in the icebox, and you can
find a bowl over there."

764
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,099
He stared at Allie, watching her cut the carrots.

765
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:11,569
As he did that, he wondered again, why she
had come, especially now that she was engaged.

766
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:13,579
None of this made much sense to him.

767
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:16,369
But then Allie had always been surprising.

768
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:19,220
He smiled, remembering the way she had been.

769
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,730
Fiery, spontaneous, passionate - as he imagined
most artists to be.

770
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,400
And she was definitely that.

771
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,660
Artistic talent like hers was a gift.

772
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:33,109
He remembered seeing some paintings in the
museums in New York and thinking that her

773
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,079
work was just as good.

774
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,269
She had given him a painting before she'd
left that summer.

775
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,910
It hung above the fireplace in the living
room.

776
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:48,529
She'd called it a picture of her dreams, and
to him it had seemed extremely sensual.

777
00:49:48,529 --> 00:49:54,309
When he looked at it, he could see desire
in the colours and the lines, and if he focused

778
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:58,710
carefully, he could imagine what she had been
thinking with every stroke.

779
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:02,780
A dog barked in the distance, and Noah realized
he had been standing with the door open a

780
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,780
long time.

781
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
He closed it quickly and went into the kitchen.

782
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,780
"How's it going?" he asked, seeing she was
nearly finished.

783
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,780
"Good.

784
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,780
I'm almost done here.

785
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,059
Anything else for dinner?"

786
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,999
"I have some homemade bread.

787
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:12,279
From a neighbour," he added.

788
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:17,099
He began to wash the crabs, holding them under
the tap.

789
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:21,099
Allie picked up her cup and came over to watch
him.

790
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:24,700
"You want to sit on the porch for a few minutes?

791
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,230
I'd like to let them marinate for a half-hour."

792
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,230
"Sure," she said.

793
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,089
He wiped his hands, and together they went
to the back porch.

794
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:38,300
Noah turned on the light as they went outside,
and he sat in the older rocker, offering the

795
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,720
newer one to her.

796
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,749
"You were sitting out here when I came, weren't
you?"

797
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:45,749
she asked.

798
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:46,749
"Yeah.

799
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:48,369
I sit out here every night.

800
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:49,599
It's a habit now."

801
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,250
"I can see why," she said as she looked around.

802
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,170
"So, what is it you do these days?"

803
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,540
"Actually, I don't do anything but work on
the house right now.

804
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,359
It satisfies my creative urges."

805
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,460
"How can you...

806
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,460
I mean..."

807
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,460
"Morris Goldman.

808
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,099
My old boss from up north.

809
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:12,440
He offered me a part of the business just
as I joined the army, and died before I got

810
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,440
home.

811
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,900
When I got back to the States, his lawyers
gave me a cheque big enough to buy this place

812
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,900
and fix it up."

813
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,900
She laughed under her breath.

814
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,880
"You always told me you'd find a way to do
it."

815
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,829
They both sat quietly for a moment, thinking
back again.

816
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:29,619
Allie took another sip of tea.

817
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:35,759
"Do you remember sneaking over here the night
you first told me about this place?"

818
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:43,210
He nodded, and she went on: "I got home a
little late that evening, and my parents were

819
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,630
furious when I finally came in.

820
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:52,099
I can still picture my daddy standing in the
living room smoking a cigarette, my mother

821
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:53,980
on the sofa staring straight ahead.

822
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,609
I swear, they looked as if a family member
had died.

823
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:03,849
That was the first time my parents knew I
was serious about you, and my mother had a

824
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:05,119
long talk with me later that night.

825
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,540
She said to me, 'I'm sure you think that I
don't understand what you're going through,

826
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,619
but I do.

827
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:18,119
It's just that sometimes our future is dictated
by what we are, as opposed to what we want.'

828
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,740
I remember I was really hurt when she said
that."

829
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,630
"You told me about it the next day.

830
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,430
It hurt my feelings, too.

831
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:31,130
I liked your parents and I had no idea they
didn't like me."

832
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,660
"It wasn't that they didn't like you.

833
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,700
They didn't think you deserved me."

834
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,319
"There's not much difference."

835
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:40,270
"I feel that it's wrong, that it isn't fair.

836
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:45,520
It was a terrible thing for a girl to learn,
that status is more important than feelings."

837
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,630
Noah said nothing.

838
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,300
"I've thought about you ever since that summer,"
she said.

839
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,300
"You have?"

840
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,869
"Why wouldn't you think so?"

841
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,340
She seemed genuinely surprised.

842
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,170
"You never answered my letters."

843
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,170
"You wrote?"

844
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,170
"Dozens of letters.

845
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,410
I wrote to you for two years without receiving
a single reply."

846
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,720
She slowly shook her head before lowering
her eyes.

847
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:12,089
"I didn't know," she said finally, quietly,
and then he thought that her mother had been

848
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,289
checking the mail, removing the letters without
her knowledge.

849
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:19,190
It was what he had always suspected, and he
watched as Allie came to the same realization.

850
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,630
"It was wrong of her to do that, Noah, and
I'm sorry she did.

851
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,630
But try to understand.

852
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:33,160
Once I left, she probably thought it would
be easier for me to just let it go.

853
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:40,710
She never understood how much you meant to
me, and, to be honest, I don't even know if

854
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,760
she ever loved my father the way I loved you.

855
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,480
In her mind, she was just trying to protect
my feelings, and she probably thought the

856
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,380
best way to do that was to hide the letters
you sent."

857
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,309
"That wasn't her decision to make," he said
quietly.

858
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:00,309
"I know."

859
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:03,540
"Would it have made a difference even if you'd
got them?"

860
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,019
It took a moment for her to answer.

861
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:07,619
"I don't know, Noah.

862
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,430
I really don't, and you don't either.

863
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,599
We're not the same people we were then.

864
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:15,760
We've changed.

865
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,510
Both of us."

866
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:18,930
She paused and went on.

867
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,559
"But yes, Noah, I think...

868
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,529
at least, I'd like to think that it would
have made a difference."

869
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:25,099
He nodded, looked down, and then turned away.

870
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,099
"What's Lon like?"

871
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,089
She hesitated, not expecting the question.

872
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:29,989
"Lon's handsome, charming and successful.

873
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:37,839
He's kind to me, he makes me laugh, and I
know he loves me in his own way."

874
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:38,849
She collected her thoughts.

875
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:40,589
"But there's always going to be something
missing in our relationship."

876
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:45,769
She surprised herself with her answer but
knew it was true nonetheless.

877
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:50,769
And she also knew by looking at him that Noah
had suspected the answer in advance when he

878
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:51,769
asked, "Why?"

879
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:54,960
She shrugged and her voice was barely above
a whisper.

880
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,359
"I guess I still look for the kind of love
we had that summer."

881
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:08,609
Noah thought about what she had said, thought
about the relationships he'd had since he'd

882
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,140
last seen her.

883
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,299
"How about you'?" she asked.

884
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:14,089
"Did you ever think about us?"

885
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:15,400
"All the time.

886
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,650
I still do."

887
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,329
"Are you seeing anyone?"

888
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:20,849
"No," he answered, shaking his head.

889
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:24,059
"I'm going to go and start the water.

890
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,940
Can I get you anything'?"

891
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:35,829
She shook her head, and Noah went to the kitchen.

892
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:42,109
He was thinking about Allie and the love that
was missing from both their lives.

893
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,960
Allie, too, was thinking.

894
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,200
About Noah, about herself, about many things.

895
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,660
For a moment, she wished that she weren't
engaged, but then quickly cursed herself.

896
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,999
It wasn't Noah she loved; she loved what they
once had been.

897
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:06,170
Besides, it was normal to feel this way.

898
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:15,400
Her first real love, the only man she'd ever
been with - how could she expect to forget

899
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
him?

900
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:23,599
Yet was it normal for her insides to tremble
whenever he came near?

901
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,920
Was it normal to confess things she could
never tell anyone else?

902
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:38,979
Was it normal to come here three weeks before
her wedding day?

903
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:49,160
"No, it's not," she finally whispered to herself
as she looked at the evening sky, "there's

904
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,510
nothing normal about any of this."

905
00:56:52,510 --> 00:57:03,150
Noah came out at that moment and she smiled
at him, glad he'd come back so she didn't

906
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,410
have to think about it anymore.

907
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:12,240
"It's going to take a few minutes," he said
as he sat down.

908
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,369
"That's fine.

909
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:16,220
I'm not that hungry yet."

910
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:22,869
He looked at her then, and she saw the softness
in his eyes.

911
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:26,260
"I'm glad you came, Allie," he said.

912
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,260
"Me too.

913
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,339
I almost didn't, though."

914
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:29,730
"Why did you come?"

915
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,979
"I was compelled," she wanted to say, but
didn't.

916
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:37,569
"Just to see you, to find out what you are
doing.

917
00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:38,719
To see how you are."

918
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:43,890
He wondered if that was all, but didn't question
further.

919
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:44,890
Instead, he changed the subject.

920
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,920
"By the way, do you still paint?"

921
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,799
She shook her head.

922
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:48,950
"Not anymore."

923
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:49,950
He was stunned.

924
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:50,950
"Why not?

925
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:51,950
You have so much talent."

926
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:52,950
"It's a long story."

927
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,289
"I've got all night," he answered.

928
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:57,339
"Did you really think I was talented?"

929
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:58,339
she asked quietly.

930
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:00,660
"Come on," he said, reaching out for her hand.

931
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,609
"I want to show you something."

932
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:13,910
She got up and followed him through the door
to the living room.

933
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:25,470
He stopped in front of the fireplace and pointed
to the painting that hung above the mantelpiece.

934
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,599
She gasped, surprised she hadn't noticed it
earlier, more surprised it was here at all.

935
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:31,599
"You kept it'?"

936
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,250
"Of course I kept it.

937
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,250
It's wonderful."

938
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,640
She gave him a skeptical look, and he explained.

939
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,930
"It makes me feel alive when I look at it.

940
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,890
Sometimes I have to get up and touch it.

941
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,890
It's incredible, Allie.

942
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:48,260
You mean to tell me no one has ever told you
that before?"

943
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:53,430
"My professor did," she said, "but I guess
I didn't believe him."

944
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,819
He knew there was more.

945
00:58:55,819 --> 00:58:58,219
Allie looked away before continuing.

946
00:58:58,219 --> 00:59:03,009
"I've been drawing and painting since I was
a child.

947
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:11,630
I guess that once I got a little older I began
to think I was good at it.

948
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,549
I enjoyed it too.

949
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:20,940
I remember working on this painting that summer,
adding to it every day, changing it as our

950
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,940
relationship changed.

951
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:27,029
I don't even remember how it started or what
I wanted it to be, but somehow it developed

952
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:28,029
into this.

953
00:59:28,029 --> 00:59:36,180
"I remember that I was unable to stop painting
after I went home that summer.

954
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:40,400
I think it was my way of avoiding the pain
I was going through.

955
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:48,319
Anyway, I ended up majoring in art in college
because it was something I had to do; I remember

956
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:53,890
how I spent hours in the studio all by myself
and enjoyed every minute.

957
00:59:53,890 --> 01:00:00,469
I loved the freedom I felt when I created,
the way it made me feel to make something

958
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:01,469
beautiful.

959
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:07,349
Just before I graduated, my professor, who
was also the critic for the paper, told me

960
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,079
I had a lot of talent.

961
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,569
He told me I should try my luck as an artist.

962
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,529
But I didn't listen to him."

963
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,640
She stopped for a moment, gathering her thoughts.

964
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,490
"My parents didn't think it was good for someone
like me to paint for a living.

965
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,569
I just stopped after a while.

966
01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:28,720
I haven't touched a brush in years."

967
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,380
She stared at the painting.

968
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,249
"I'm not sure if I can paint anymore.

969
01:00:35,249 --> 01:00:36,249
It's been a long time."

970
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:37,249
"You can still do it, Allie.

971
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:38,249
I know you can.

972
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:42,960
You have a talent that comes from inside you,
from your heart, not from your fingers.

973
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,799
What you have can't ever go away.

974
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:48,640
It's what other people only dream about.

975
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,259
You're an artist, Allie."

976
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:56,759
The words were spoken with such sincerity
that she knew he wasn't saying it just to

977
01:00:56,759 --> 01:00:57,759
be nice.

978
01:00:57,759 --> 01:01:05,589
He truly believed in her ability, and for
some reason that meant more to her than she

979
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:06,849
expected.

980
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:09,019
She turned to face him.

981
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:16,299
She reached over and touched his hand, hesitantly,
gently, amazed that after all these years

982
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:20,900
he had somehow known exactly what she'd needed
to hear.

983
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,969
When their eyes locked, she once again realized
how special he was.

984
01:01:24,969 --> 01:01:29,539
And for just a fleeting moment, she wondered
if she was in love with him again.

985
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:32,930
THE TIMER WENT off in the kitchen and Noah
turned away, strangely affected by what had

986
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:33,930
just happened between them.

987
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:39,979
Her eyes had spoken to him and whispered something
he longed to hear; yet he couldn't stop the

988
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:46,950
voice inside his head, her voice that had
told him of her love for another man.

989
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:56,220
He silently cursed the timer as he walked
to the kitchen and removed the bread from

990
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,960
the oven.

991
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,190
He saw that the frying pan was ready.

992
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:05,299
He added the vegetables and heard them crackling.

993
01:02:05,299 --> 01:02:14,420
Then he spread some butter on the bread and
melted a bit more for the crabs.

994
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:22,789
Allie had followed him into the kitchen and
cleared her throat.

995
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:26,999
"Can I get the table ready?"

996
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:29,619
Noah used the bread knife as a pointer.

997
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:32,069
"Sure, plates are over there.

998
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:34,029
Utensils and napkins there."

999
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:37,950
He couldn't look at her as he spoke.

1000
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:44,329
He didn't want to be mistaken about what had
just happened between them.

1001
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:50,059
Allie, too, was wondering about the moment
and feeling warm as she thought of it.

1002
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:56,259
The words he'd spoken replayed in her head
as she found everything she needed for the

1003
01:02:56,259 --> 01:02:57,259
table settings.

1004
01:02:57,259 --> 01:02:59,539
Noah handed her the bread and their fingers
touched briefly.

1005
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:03,810
He turned his attention back to the frying
pan and stirred the vegetables.

1006
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:08,760
He lifted the lid of the steamer, and let
the crabs cook some more.

1007
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,309
He was more composed now and returned to small
talk, easy conversation.

1008
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:15,709
"Have you ever had crab before?"

1009
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,309
"A couple of times.

1010
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:18,910
But only in salads."

1011
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:19,910
He laughed.

1012
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,519
"Then you're in for an adventure.

1013
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,210
Hold on a second."

1014
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:30,039
He disappeared upstairs for a moment, then
returned with a navy-blue button-down shirt.

1015
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,849
He held it out for her.

1016
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:35,660
"Here, put this on.

1017
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,910
I don't want you to stain your dress."

1018
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:47,109
Allie put it on and smelt the fragrance that
lingered in the shirt - his smell, distinctive,

1019
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:48,109
natural.

1020
01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:52,559
"Don't worry." he said, seeing her expression,
"it's clean."

1021
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:53,559
She laughed.

1022
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:54,559
"I know.

1023
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,640
It just reminds me of our first real date.

1024
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,150
You gave me your jacket that night, remember?"

1025
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,150
He nodded.

1026
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:05,829
The vegetables and crabs were ready at about
the same time.

1027
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:12,300
"Be careful, they're hot," he said as he handed
them to her, and they sat across from each

1028
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,829
other at the small wooden table.

1029
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:21,089
After putting some vegetables and bread on
their plates, Noah added a crab, and Allie

1030
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:23,890
sat for a moment, staring at it.

1031
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:27,900
"Here, let me show you how it's done," he
said.

1032
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:37,430
He made it look easy, removing the meat and
putting it on her plate.

1033
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,200
They started talking then, making up for lost
time.

1034
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,509
Noah talked about leaving New Bern, about
working at the scrap yard in New Jersey.

1035
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:56,650
He spoke fondly of Morris Goldman and touched
on the war a little, and told her how much

1036
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,059
he missed his father.

1037
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:05,289
Allie talked about going to college, painting,
and her hours spent volunteering at the hospital.

1038
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:06,289
She talked about her family.

1039
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:11,059
Neither of them mentioned anybody they had
dated since they'd last seen each other.

1040
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:18,109
Even Lon was ignored, and though both of them
noticed the omission, neither spoke of it.

1041
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:30,099
Afterwards Allie tried to remember the last
time she and Lon had talked this way.

1042
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:38,729
Although he listened well and they seldom
argued, he was not the type of man to talk

1043
01:05:38,729 --> 01:05:39,779
like this.

1044
01:05:39,779 --> 01:05:43,950
Like her father, he wasn't comfortable sharing
feelings.

1045
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:51,589
She'd tried to explain that she needed to
be closer to him, but it had never changed

1046
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:52,589
anything.

1047
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:55,779
Sitting here now, she realized what she'd
been missing.

1048
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:58,130
The sky grew darker and the moon rose higher
as the evening wore on.

1049
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:02,540
And though they were not conscious of it,
they began to regain the intimacy, the bond

1050
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,700
of familiarity, they had once shared.

1051
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:10,049
THEY FINISHED dinner, both pleased with the
meal, neither talking much now.

1052
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:14,869
Noah looked at his watch and saw that it was
getting late.

1053
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:20,369
The stars were shining brightly, the crickets
were a little quieter now.

1054
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:26,349
"How about the porch again?" he asked, handing
her the cup, and she agreed, leading the way.

1055
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:33,259
He grabbed a quilt for her in case she got
cold, and soon they had taken their places

1056
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:34,259
again.

1057
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:38,509
The quilt was over her legs; their rockers
were moving.

1058
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:42,799
Noah watched her from the comer of his eye.

1059
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:45,190
"God, she's beautiful," he thought.

1060
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,220
And inside he ached.

1061
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,800
For something had happened during dinner.

1062
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,469
Quite simply, he had fallen in love again.

1063
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:57,589
He knew that now as they sat next to one another.

1064
01:06:57,589 --> 01:07:01,339
Fallen in love with a new Allie, not just
her memory.

1065
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:05,670
But then he had never really stopped, and
this, he realized, was his destiny.

1066
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:14,539
Noah glanced up at the stars, their twinkling
lights reminded him that she would be leaving

1067
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:18,539
soon, and he felt almost empty inside.

1068
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:24,459
This was a night he wanted never to end.

1069
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:26,310
How should he tell her?

1070
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:31,790
What could he say that would make her stay?

1071
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:35,819
"Talk to me," she finally said.

1072
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,740
"What should I say?"

1073
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:42,220
"Talk like you did to me under the oak tree."

1074
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,219
And he did, reciting distant passages, toasting
the night.

1075
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:54,789
She rested her head against the back of the
rocker, closing her eyes.

1076
01:07:54,789 --> 01:08:05,089
It wasn't just the poems or his voice that
did it.

1077
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:14,599
It was all of it, the whole greater than the
sum of the parts.

1078
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:25,150
Lon could not evoke these feelings in her.

1079
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:33,250
He never had and probably never would.

1080
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:37,750
Maybe that was why she had never been to bed
with him.

1081
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:44,790
She had always used the excuse that she wanted
to wait until marriage.

1082
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:59,549
He took it well, usually, and she sometimes
wondered how hurt he would be if he ever found

1083
01:08:59,549 --> 01:09:00,989
out about Noah.

1084
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:08,040
But there was something else that made her
want to wait, and it had to do with Lon himself.

1085
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,390
His work always came first.

1086
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:16,000
For him there was no time for poems and wasted
evenings on porches.

1087
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,989
She knew this was why he was successful, and
part of her respected him for that.

1088
01:09:22,989 --> 01:09:26,400
But she also sensed it wasn't enough.

1089
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,159
She wanted something more.

1090
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,230
Passion and romance, perhaps, or quiet conversations.

1091
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,980
Noah, too, was thinking.

1092
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:40,850
As he rocked, he remembered the thousands
of empty nights he had spent since they'd

1093
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,150
last seen each other.

1094
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:46,650
Seeing her again brought all those feelings
to the surface, and he found it impossible

1095
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:47,960
to press them back down.

1096
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,930
He knew then he wanted to make love to her
again and to have her love in return.

1097
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:56,750
It was what he needed most in the world.

1098
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,940
But he also realized it could never be.

1099
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,940
Now that she was engaged.

1100
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:05,880
Allie put down the tea, then ran her hands
through her hair, closing her eyes as she

1101
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,050
did so.

1102
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:13,489
"Are you tired?" he asked, finally breaking
free from his thoughts.

1103
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:14,670
"A little.

1104
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:26,880
I should really be going in a couple of minutes."

1105
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,409
"I know," he said, nodding, and his tone was
neutral.

1106
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:35,030
She didn't get up right away.

1107
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:43,070
Instead, she picked up the cup and drank the
last swallow of tea, feeling it warm her throat.

1108
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,810
She took the evening in.

1109
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:51,090
Moon was higher now; temperature was dropping.

1110
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:58,989
"I should go," she finally said, handing the
quilt back to him.

1111
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:02,690
Noah nodded, and then stood without a word.

1112
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:10,100
He carried the quilt, and the two of them
walked to her car while fallen leaves crunched

1113
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,450
beneath their feet.

1114
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:19,630
She started to take off the shirt he'd lent
her as he opened the door, but he stopped

1115
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,630
her.

1116
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,050
"Keep it," he said.

1117
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,970
"I want you to have it."

1118
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:29,730
She didn't ask why, because she wanted to
keep it, too.

1119
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:35,179
"I had a great time tonight," he said, "thank
you for finding me."

1120
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:37,280
"I did, too," she answered.

1121
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,929
He summoned his courage.

1122
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:40,920
"Will I see you tomorrow?"

1123
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,260
A simple question.

1124
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,950
She knew what the answer should be.

1125
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:54,219
"I don't think we should," was all she had
to say, and it would end right here and now.

1126
01:11:54,219 --> 01:12:01,179
But for a second the demon of choice confronted
her, teased her, challenged her.

1127
01:12:01,179 --> 01:12:03,159
Why couldn't she say it?

1128
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:13,820
As she looked in his eyes to find the answer
she needed, she saw the man she'd once fallen

1129
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:19,260
in love with, and suddenly it all came clear.

1130
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,340
"I'd like that."

1131
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,340
Noah was surprised.

1132
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:25,080
He hadn't expected her to answer this way.

1133
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:30,730
He wanted to touch her then, to take her in
his arms, but he didn't.

1134
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:33,160
"Can you be here about noon?"

1135
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,160
"Sure.

1136
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,460
What do you want to do?"

1137
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:41,020
"You'll see," he answered.

1138
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:47,690
"I know just the place to go."

1139
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,280
"Have I ever been there before?"

1140
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,860
"No, but it's a special place.

1141
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,159
You'll love it."

1142
01:12:54,159 --> 01:13:01,869
She moved away before he could attempt a kiss.

1143
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:09,800
She slid behind the wheel, breathing a sigh
of relief.

1144
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,560
He shut the door for her, and she started
the engine.

1145
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,540
"See you tomorrow," she said.

1146
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:22,050
Noah waved as she turned the car around and
then drove up the lane, heading back towards

1147
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,050
town.

1148
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:28,860
He watched until the lights vanished behind
far-off oak trees and the engine noise was

1149
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:29,860
gone.

1150
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:38,010
Clem wandered up to him and they returned
to the back porch side by side.

1151
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:45,110
He sat in the rocker again, trying once more
to fathom the evening that had just passed.

1152
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,110
Replaying it.

1153
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,920
Running it in slow motion.

1154
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:54,210
"She's engaged," he finally whispered, and
then was silent for hours.

1155
01:13:54,210 --> 01:14:00,489
The night was quiet, with little activity
except for Clem, who checked on him occasionally

1156
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:02,830
as if to ask, "Are you all right?"

1157
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:10,590
And some time after midnight on that clear
October evening, Noah was overcome with longing.

1158
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:20,139
He looked like an old man now, like someone
who'd aged a lifetime in just a couple of

1159
01:14:20,139 --> 01:14:21,139
hours.

1160
01:14:21,139 --> 01:14:26,429
He bent over in his rocker with tears in his
eyes.

1161
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:30,110
He didn't know how to stop them.

1162
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,570
CHAPTER FOUR

1163
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:36,700
PHONE CALLS
LON HUNG up the phone.

1164
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:44,040
He had called at seven, then at eight thirty,
and now he checked his watch again.

1165
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,040
Nine forty-five.

1166
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,120
Where was she?

1167
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:53,300
He knew she was where she had said she would
be because he had spoken to the manager.

1168
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:58,570
Yes, she had checked in and he had last seen
her around six.

1169
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,590
Going to dinner, he thought.

1170
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:02,630
No, he hadn't seen her since.

1171
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:07,480
Lon shook his head and leaned back in his
chair.

1172
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:12,550
He was the last one in the office as usual.

1173
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:18,810
That was normal with an ongoing trial, even
if the trial was going well.

1174
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,840
Law was his passion.

1175
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,490
He knew he would win the case because he mastered
the law and charmed the jury.

1176
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,360
He always did, and losses were infrequent
now.

1177
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,269
But most of his success came from hard work.

1178
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:36,190
He had always paid attention to details, especially
when he'd begun his practice.

1179
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:44,250
Little things, obscure things, and it had
become a habit now.

1180
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,889
And now, a little detail bothered him.

1181
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:48,690
Not about the case.

1182
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,070
That was fine.

1183
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,639
It was something else.

1184
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:52,810
Something about Allie.

1185
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:53,989
The little detail.

1186
01:15:53,989 --> 01:15:54,989
Detail...

1187
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:55,989
Something insignificant?

1188
01:15:55,989 --> 01:15:56,989
Something important?

1189
01:15:56,989 --> 01:15:57,989
Think...

1190
01:15:57,989 --> 01:15:58,989
Damn, what was it?

1191
01:15:58,989 --> 01:15:59,989
His mind clicked.

1192
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:00,989
Something...

1193
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:01,989
something... something said?

1194
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:02,989
Something had been said?

1195
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:03,989
Yes, that was it.

1196
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:05,360
But what was it?

1197
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,110
Had Allie said anything on the phone?

1198
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:15,429
That had been when it started, and he ran
through the conversation again.

1199
01:16:15,429 --> 01:16:17,920
What had she said?

1200
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,910
Her trip was good; she had checked in, had
done some shopping.

1201
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:23,910
Checked in?

1202
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:24,989
Yes, that was it.

1203
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,719
He closed his eyes and thought for a second.

1204
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:28,760
New Bern.

1205
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,880
The thought popped into his head.

1206
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,880
Yes.

1207
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,880
New Bern.

1208
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,989
That was it.

1209
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:38,619
The little detail or part of it.

1210
01:16:38,619 --> 01:16:40,179
What else, though?

1211
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:45,110
New Bern, he thought again, and knew the name.

1212
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:51,110
He knew the town a little, mainly from a few
trials he had been in.

1213
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:57,310
Stopped there a few times on the way to the
coast.

1214
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,310
Nothing special.

1215
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:02,280
He and Allie had never been there together.

1216
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,590
But Allie had been there before.

1217
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:10,010
Allie, New Bern... and... something at a party.

1218
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,500
A comment from Allie's mother.

1219
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,820
What had she said?

1220
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,659
Lon paled then, remembering.

1221
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:18,790
Remembering what Allie's mother had said so
long ago.

1222
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:23,790
It was something about Allie being in love
one time with a young man from New Bern.

1223
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:25,570
Called it puppy love.

1224
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:30,889
So what, he had thought when he'd heard it,
and had turned to smile at Allie.

1225
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:32,080
But she hadn't smiled.

1226
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,080
She was angry.

1227
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,280
And then Lon guessed that she had loved that
person far more deeply than her mother had

1228
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,280
suggested.

1229
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,280
Maybe more deeply than she loved Lon.

1230
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,280
And now she was there.

1231
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,280
Interesting.

1232
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,280
Coincidence?

1233
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,280
Could be nothing.

1234
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,280
Could be exactly what she said.

1235
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,280
Could be stress and antique shopping.

1236
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,280
Possible.

1237
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,280
Even probable.

1238
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,280
Yet... what if?

1239
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,210
Lon considered the other possibility, and
for the first time in a long while, he became

1240
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,210
frightened.

1241
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,510
What if she's with him?

1242
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:58,540
He made up his mind then that he would do
anything it took to keep her.

1243
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:03,460
She was everything he'd always needed, and
he'd never find another quite like her.

1244
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:07,900
So, with trembling hands, he dialled the phone
for the fourth and last time that evening.

1245
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,560
And again there was no answer.

1246
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,560
CHAPTER FIVE

1247
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,139
KAYAK AND FORGOTTEN DREAMS
ALLIE WOKE early the next morning.

1248
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:22,440
She'd slept in the shirt he'd given her, and
she smelt him once again while thinking about

1249
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,250
the evening they'd spent together.

1250
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:28,830
She looked out of the window and watched the
singing birds.

1251
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:32,870
Noah, she knew, had always been a morning
person.

1252
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:39,440
She knew he liked to kayak or canoe, and she
remembered one morning she'd spent with him

1253
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,239
in his canoe, watching the sun come up.

1254
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:47,500
She'd had to sneak out of her window to do
it because her parents wouldn't allow it,

1255
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,080
but she hadn't been caught and she remembered
how Noah had slipped his arm around her and

1256
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,760
pulled her close as dawn began to unfold.

1257
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,640
"Look there," he'd whispered, and she'd watched
her first sunrise with her head on his shoulder,

1258
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,969
wondering if anything could be better than
that moment.

1259
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:09,730
As she got out of bed to take her bath, feeling
the cold floor beneath her feet, she wondered

1260
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:16,949
if he'd been on the water this morning watching
another day begin, and thought that he probably

1261
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:17,949
had.

1262
01:19:17,949 --> 01:19:18,949
SHE WAS RIGHT.

1263
01:19:18,949 --> 01:19:25,670
Noah was up before the sun and dressed quickly,
walked to the dock where his kayak was stored.

1264
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:31,420
He liked to let the river work its magic,
loosening up his muscles, warming his body,

1265
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,420
clearing his mind.

1266
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,969
Questions danced in his mind.

1267
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:38,760
He wondered about Lon and what type of man
he was, wondered about their relationship.

1268
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:44,130
Most of all, though, he wondered about Allie
and why she had come.

1269
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:48,849
By the time he reached home, he felt renewed.

1270
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:54,570
Checking his watch, he was surprised to find
that it had taken two hours.

1271
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,679
Time always played tricks out there.

1272
01:19:56,679 --> 01:20:06,020
In the western sky he saw storm clouds, thick
and heavy, far off but definitely present.

1273
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:11,590
The winds weren't blowing hard but they were
bringing the clouds closer.

1274
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:17,469
From the look of them, he didn't want to be
outside when they got here.

1275
01:20:17,469 --> 01:20:18,469
Damn.

1276
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:20,320
How much time did he have?

1277
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,360
A few hours, maybe more.

1278
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:27,520
He showered, put on new jeans, a red shirt
and black cowboy boots, brushed his hair and

1279
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,790
went downstairs to the kitchen.

1280
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:40,449
He did the dishes from the night before, made
himself some coffee and went to the porch.

1281
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:43,559
The sky was darker now and he checked the
barometer.

1282
01:20:43,559 --> 01:20:45,909
Steady, but it would start dropping soon.

1283
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,580
ALLIE SPENT the morning downtown.

1284
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:52,659
The park looked exactly the same as it had
fourteen years ago, and the kids who played

1285
01:20:52,659 --> 01:20:56,970
on the swings after school probably looked
the same as well.

1286
01:20:56,970 --> 01:21:00,489
She smiled at the memory then, thinking back
to when things were simpler.

1287
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:02,260
Or at least had seemed to be.

1288
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,050
Now, nothing was simple.

1289
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:11,329
She wondered what she would be doing now,
had she never seen the article in the paper.

1290
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:16,929
It wasn't very difficult to imagine, because
her routines seldom changed.

1291
01:21:16,929 --> 01:21:22,579
It was Wednesday, which meant bridge at the
country club, then on to the Junior Women's

1292
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:27,310
League, where they would probably arrange
another fund-raiser for the private school

1293
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:28,310
or hospital.

1294
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:35,420
After that, a visit to her mother, then home
to get ready for dinner with Lon, because

1295
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,829
he left work by seven.

1296
01:21:36,829 --> 01:21:41,699
It was the one night a week she saw him regularly.

1297
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:47,900
She suppressed a feeling of sadness about
that, hoping that one day he would change.

1298
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:50,780
She came to an art gallery.

1299
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:56,949
She paused at the door for a second, surprised
at how long it had been since she'd been in

1300
01:21:56,949 --> 01:21:57,949
one.

1301
01:21:57,949 --> 01:21:59,110
At least three years, maybe longer.

1302
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,850
She went inside and walked among the paintings.

1303
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:06,150
Many of the artists didn't seem to be very
talented.

1304
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:13,910
On one wall, though, there were a few paintings
more suited to her tastes, by an artist she'd

1305
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:15,200
never heard of.

1306
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:20,829
In the painting, she liked the best, she noted
the artist had purposely exaggerated the scene

1307
01:22:20,829 --> 01:22:25,440
with smaller-than-life figures, wide lines
and heavy sweeps of vivid colour.

1308
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,440
It was dynamic, dramatic.

1309
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:30,409
Suddenly she realized that she liked it because
it reminded her of her own work.

1310
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:34,770
She examined it more closely and thought to
herself that maybe Noah was right.

1311
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,360
Maybe she should start painting again.

1312
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,760
At nine thirty, Allie left the gallery and
went to a department store.

1313
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,909
It took a few minutes to find what she was
looking for.

1314
01:22:43,909 --> 01:22:48,050
Paper, drawing chalk and pencils, not high
quality but good enough.

1315
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:53,750
It was a start, and she was excited by the
time she got back to her room.

1316
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:59,909
She sat at the desk and started working: nothing
specific, just getting the feel of it again,

1317
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:03,219
letting shapes and colours flow from the memory
of her youth.

1318
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:04,780
After a few minutes, she did a rough sketch
of the street scene as seen from her room,

1319
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,090
amazed at how easily it came.

1320
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:09,120
It was almost as if she'd never stopped.

1321
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:13,920
She examined it when she was finished, pleased
with the effort.

1322
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,260
She wondered what to try next and finally
decided.

1323
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:25,559
Since she didn't have a model, she visualized
it in her head before starting.

1324
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:30,659
And though it was harder than the street scene,
it began to take form.

1325
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:32,150
Minutes passed quickly.

1326
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:36,969
She worked steadily, checking the time frequently
so she wouldn't be late, and finished it a

1327
01:23:36,969 --> 01:23:40,630
little before noon.

1328
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:43,480
It had taken almost two hours, but the result
surprised her.

1329
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,130
It looked as though it had taken a great deal
longer.

1330
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:49,679
After rolling it up, she put it in a bag and
collected the rest of her things.

1331
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:56,820
On her way out of the door, she looked at
herself in the mirror, feeling oddly relaxed,

1332
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:59,190
not exactly sure why.

1333
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:03,639
Down the stairs and out of the door.

1334
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:06,070
As she left, she heard a voice behind her.

1335
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,070
"Miss?"

1336
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:08,070
She turned.

1337
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:09,070
The manager.

1338
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:14,140
The same man as yesterday, with a curious
look on his face.

1339
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,140
"Yes?"

1340
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,639
"You had some calls last night."

1341
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:17,639
She was shocked.

1342
01:24:17,639 --> 01:24:18,639
"I did?"

1343
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:19,639
"Yes.

1344
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:20,639
All from Mr. Hammond."

1345
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:21,639
Oh, God.

1346
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:22,639
"Lon called?"

1347
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:23,639
"Yes, ma'am, four times.

1348
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:24,639
He was concerned about you.

1349
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:25,639
He said he was your fiance."

1350
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:28,329
She smiled weakly, trying to hide what she
was thinking.

1351
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:29,329
Four times?

1352
01:24:29,329 --> 01:24:30,329
Four?

1353
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:31,329
What could that mean?

1354
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:32,329
What if something had happened back home?

1355
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:33,329
"Did he say anything?

1356
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:34,329
Is it an emergency?"

1357
01:24:34,329 --> 01:24:35,329
He shook his head quickly.

1358
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:36,599
"He really didn't say, miss.

1359
01:24:36,599 --> 01:24:39,080
Actually, he sounded more concerned about
you."

1360
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,179
Good, she thought.

1361
01:24:40,179 --> 01:24:41,179
That's good.

1362
01:24:41,179 --> 01:24:45,360
And then, suddenly, she felt a pang in her
chest.

1363
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,840
Why so many calls?

1364
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,380
Had she said anything yesterday?

1365
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,370
Why would he be so persistent?

1366
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,030
It was completely unlike him.

1367
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:55,820
She had to call him now: there was no way
to get around it.

1368
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,199
But she didn't want to.

1369
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:00,790
This was her time, and she wanted to spend
it doing what she wanted.

1370
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:05,460
She hadn't planned on speaking to him until
later, and she felt that talking to him now

1371
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,020
could spoil the day.

1372
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,739
Besides, what was she going to say?

1373
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:10,739
"Miss?"

1374
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:11,739
Almost noon, she thought.

1375
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:12,860
Where would he be?

1376
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:13,900
His office, probably...

1377
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,900
no.

1378
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,360
In court, she suddenly realized, and immediately
felt fine.

1379
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:22,139
There was no way she could talk to him, even
if she wanted to.

1380
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:23,659
She was surprised by her feelings.

1381
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:27,219
She shouldn't feel this way, she knew, and
yet it didn't bother her.

1382
01:25:27,219 --> 01:25:28,219
She looked at her watch, acting now.

1383
01:25:28,219 --> 01:25:29,219
"Is it really almost twelve?"

1384
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:30,219
The manager looked at the clock.

1385
01:25:30,219 --> 01:25:31,219
"Yes, a quarter to."

1386
01:25:31,219 --> 01:25:37,010
"Unfortunately," she started, "he's in court
right now and I can't reach him.

1387
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:42,510
If he calls again, could you tell him I'm
shopping and that I'll try to call him later?"

1388
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:43,860
"Of course," he answered.

1389
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,550
"Thank you," she said, smiling.

1390
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,570
"I'd appreciate it."

1391
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:52,770
Two minutes later, she was in her car, driving
to Noah's, anticipating the day, largely unconcerned

1392
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,429
about the phone calls.

1393
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:58,230
As she was driving over the bridge, less than
four minutes after she'd left the inn, Lon

1394
01:25:58,230 --> 01:25:59,230
called from the courthouse.

1395
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,230
CHAPTER SIX

1396
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,230
SWANS AND STORM
NOAH WAS sitting in his rocker, drinking sweet

1397
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:04,970
tea, when he finally heard the car turn up
the drive.

1398
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:07,550
He went around to the front and watched the
car pull up and park beneath the oak tree

1399
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:08,550
again.

1400
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:11,370
Noah saw Allie wave from inside the car.

1401
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:12,370
Allie met him halfway, carrying a small bag.

1402
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:15,570
She surprised him by kissing him gently on
the cheek; her free hand was lingering at

1403
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,870
his waist after she pulled back.

1404
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:20,260
"Hi," she said, with radiance in her eyes,
"where's the surprise?"

1405
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:25,659
"Not even a 'Good afternoon' or 'How was your
night?'"

1406
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:26,739
She smiled.

1407
01:26:26,739 --> 01:26:31,320
Patience had never been one of her strongest
attributes.

1408
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,320
"Fine.

1409
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,320
Good afternoon.

1410
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,889
How was your night?

1411
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,929
And where's the surprise?"

1412
01:26:36,929 --> 01:26:40,050
He laughed lightly, then paused.

1413
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:44,650
"Allie, I've got some bad news.

1414
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:50,579
I was going to take you someplace, but with
those clouds coming in I'm not sure we should

1415
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:51,579
go."

1416
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:52,579
"It's not raining yet.

1417
01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:53,579
How far is it?"

1418
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:55,540
"Up the river about a mile."

1419
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,699
"And I've never been there before?"

1420
01:26:57,699 --> 01:26:59,489
"Not when it was like this."

1421
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:02,690
She thought for a second while she looked
around.

1422
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:05,360
When she spoke, her voice was determined.

1423
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,670
"Then we'll go.

1424
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:08,860
I don't care if it rains."

1425
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:10,179
"Are you sure?"

1426
01:27:10,179 --> 01:27:11,179
"Absolutely."

1427
01:27:11,179 --> 01:27:12,829
"Then we'd better go now.

1428
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:15,530
Can I bring that in for you?"

1429
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:22,440
She nodded, handing her bag to him, and he
jogged to the house and took it inside, placing

1430
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,710
it on a chair in the living room.

1431
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:30,500
Then he grabbed some bread and put it in a
bag, bringing it with him as he left the house.

1432
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,820
They walked to the canoe.

1433
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:37,739
Allie was beside him, a little closer than
yesterday.

1434
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:46,950
After tossing the bag in the canoe, Noah slid
the canoe to the water.

1435
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,989
"Can I do anything?"

1436
01:27:48,989 --> 01:27:50,070
Allie asked.

1437
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:52,230
"No, just get in."

1438
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:56,090
After she climbed in, he pushed the canoe
further into the water.

1439
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:59,530
Then he gracefully stepped off the jetty into
the canoe.

1440
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,790
She sat at the front of the canoe, facing
backwards.

1441
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:06,030
She couldn't think of anyone else who remotely
resembled Noah.

1442
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:10,460
He was complicated, almost contradictory in
so many ways, yet simple.

1443
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:19,440
On the surface, he was a country boy, home
from war, and he probably saw himself in those

1444
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,440
terms.

1445
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,750
Yet there was so much more to him.

1446
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:33,900
Perhaps it was the poetry that made him different,
or perhaps it was the values his father had

1447
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,900
instilled in him.

1448
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:39,540
Either way, he enjoyed life more fully than
others, and that was what had first attracted

1449
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:40,540
her to him.

1450
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:45,420
She understood then that something was stirring
within her, as it had so many years ago.

1451
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,829
Watching his body move made her feel it.

1452
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:56,090
And as their eyes met for a second, she felt
the heat in her neck and breasts, and she

1453
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,860
flushed, turning away before he noticed.

1454
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:58,860
"How much further?"

1455
01:28:58,860 --> 01:28:59,860
she asked.

1456
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,860
"Another half-mile or so.

1457
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,989
Not any more than that."

1458
01:29:01,989 --> 01:29:02,989
A pause.

1459
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:09,389
Then she said, "Tell me, Noah, what do you
remember most from the summer we spent together?"

1460
01:29:09,389 --> 01:29:11,349
"All of it."

1461
01:29:11,349 --> 01:29:13,309
"Anything in particular?"

1462
01:29:13,309 --> 01:29:15,270
"No," he said.

1463
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,230
"You don't remember?"

1464
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,230
He answered quietly.

1465
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:19,310
"No, it's not that.

1466
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:20,710
It's not what you're thinking.

1467
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:25,260
I was serious when I said 'all of it.'

1468
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:32,940
I can remember every moment we were together,
and in each of them, there was something wonderful.

1469
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,820
I can't pick any one time that meant more
than any other.

1470
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,980
The entire summer was perfect.

1471
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:43,450
How could I pick one moment over another?

1472
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:49,949
"Poets often describe love as an emotion that
we can't control, one that overwhelms logic

1473
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,250
and common sense.

1474
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:54,280
That's what it was like for me.

1475
01:29:54,280 --> 01:30:02,270
I didn't plan on falling in love with you,
and I doubt if you planned on falling in love

1476
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:03,389
with me.

1477
01:30:03,389 --> 01:30:11,849
But once we met, it was clear that neither
of us could control what was happening to

1478
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:12,849
us.

1479
01:30:12,849 --> 01:30:18,630
We fell in love, despite our differences,
and once we did, something rare and beautiful

1480
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:19,630
was created.

1481
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:26,679
For me, love like that has happened only once,
and that's why every minute we spent together

1482
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:27,679
is in my memory.

1483
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,159
I'll never forget a single moment of it."

1484
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,460
Allie stared at him.

1485
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,980
No one had ever said anything like that to
her before.

1486
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:35,980
Ever.

1487
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,570
She didn't know what to say and stayed silent.

1488
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,469
"I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable,
Allie.

1489
01:30:42,469 --> 01:30:43,730
I didn't mean to.

1490
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:47,219
But that summer has stayed with me and probably
always will.

1491
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:53,600
I know it can't be the same between us, but
that doesn't change the way I felt about you

1492
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,600
then."

1493
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,849
"It didn't make me uncomfortable, Noah...

1494
01:30:57,849 --> 01:31:01,360
It's just that I don't ever hear things like
that.

1495
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,239
What you said was beautiful."

1496
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:05,040
Peaceful silence descended on them.

1497
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,590
The paddle moved rhythmically.

1498
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:15,309
The breeze had stopped, and the clouds grew
blacker as the canoe moved onwards.

1499
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:17,219
Allie noticed it all, every sound, every thought.

1500
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:23,670
Her senses had come alive, and she felt strangely
satisfied that she'd come, pleased that Noah

1501
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:31,849
had turned into the type of man she'd thought
he would, pleased that she would live forever

1502
01:31:31,849 --> 01:31:33,290
with that knowledge.

1503
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:39,390
She had seen too many men in the past few
years destroyed by war, or time, or even money.

1504
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:46,780
It took strength to hold on to inner passion,
and Noah had done that.

1505
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:56,390
This was a worker's world, not a poet's, and
people would have a hard time understanding

1506
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,390
Noah.

1507
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:05,630
Who did she know in Raleigh who took time
off to fix a house?

1508
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:07,489
Or read poetry?

1509
01:32:07,489 --> 01:32:16,980
These weren't the things that drove society,
but she felt they made living worthwhile.

1510
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:26,579
To her it was the same with art, though she
had realized it only upon coming here.

1511
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:28,969
Or rather, remembered it.

1512
01:32:28,969 --> 01:32:36,850
She had known it once before, and again she
cursed herself for forgetting something as

1513
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,599
important as creating beauty.

1514
01:32:38,599 --> 01:32:47,510
Painting was what she was meant to do, she
was sure of that now.

1515
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:50,820
She was going to try it again, no matter what
anyone said.

1516
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:52,469
Would Lon encourage her painting?

1517
01:32:52,469 --> 01:32:57,090
She remembered showing him one of her paintings
a couple of months after they had first started

1518
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:58,090
going out.

1519
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:59,560
It was abstract, meant to inspire thought.

1520
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,960
Lon had stared at it, and then had asked her
what it was supposed to be.

1521
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,160
She knew she wasn't completely fair.

1522
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,949
She loved Lon for other reasons.

1523
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:08,260
Lon was a good man.

1524
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:12,420
With him, there would be no surprises, and
there was comfort in knowing what the future

1525
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,420
would bring.

1526
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:17,820
He would be a kind husband and she would be
a good wife.

1527
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:22,110
She would have a home, friends and family,
children, a respectable place in society.

1528
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:25,370
It was the kind of life she'd always expected
to live.

1529
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:29,250
And though she wouldn't describe theirs as
a passionate relationship, she had convinced

1530
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:32,760
herself long ago that this wasn't necessary
for fulfilment.

1531
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:39,460
Passion would fade in time and things like
companionship and compatibility would take

1532
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,489
its place.

1533
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:47,699
She and Lon had this, and she had assumed
this was all she needed.

1534
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:53,369
But now, as she watched Noah rowing, she questioned
this assumption.

1535
01:33:53,369 --> 01:33:59,880
He radiated sexuality in everything he did,
everything he was, and she caught herself

1536
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:05,159
thinking about him in a way that an engaged
woman shouldn't.

1537
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:12,100
"Here we are," Noah said as he guided the
canoe towards some trees near the bank.

1538
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:15,160
Allie looked around, not seeing anything.

1539
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,180
"Where is it?"

1540
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:28,010
"Here," he said again, pointing the canoe
at a fallen tree that was almost completely

1541
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:30,630
obscuring an opening.

1542
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:44,270
He guided the canoe around the tree, and both
of them had to lower their heads to keep from

1543
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:45,270
bumping them.

1544
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:50,789
"Close your eyes," he whispered, and Allie
did, bringing her hands to her face.

1545
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:55,039
She felt the movement of the canoe.

1546
01:34:55,039 --> 01:35:03,950
"Okay," he finally said after he'd stopped
paddling, "you can open them now."

1547
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:13,960
THEY SAT in the middle of a small lake fed
by the waters of the river.

1548
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:25,869
It wasn't large, maybe a hundred yards across,
and she was surprised at how invisible it

1549
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:30,239
had been just moments before.

1550
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:31,770
It was spectacular.

1551
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,330
Swans and geese literally surrounded them.

1552
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:35,330
Thousands of them.

1553
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:46,700
Birds were floating so close together in some
places that she couldn't see the water.

1554
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:55,750
From a distance, the groups of swans looked
almost like icebergs.

1555
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,053
"Oh Noah," she finally said softly, "it's
beautiful."

1556
01:35:58,053 --> 01:36:00,880
They sat in silence for a long while, watching
the birds.

1557
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:06,690
The birds ignored them for the most part.

1558
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:18,290
The only ones that seemed bothered were those
forced to move when the canoe approached them.

1559
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:25,650
Allie reached out to touch the closest ones
and felt their feathers under her fingers.

1560
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:32,119
Noah took out the bread he'd brought in his
bag and handed it to Allie.

1561
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:38,230
She scattered it, laughing and smiling as
the birds swam in circles looking for food.

1562
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:42,750
They stayed until thunder boomed in the distance
- faint but powerful - and both of them knew

1563
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,750
it was time to leave.

1564
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:44,750
Noah paddled the canoe back.

1565
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,940
She was still amazed by what she had seen.

1566
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,520
"Noah, what are they doing here?"

1567
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,520
"I don't know.

1568
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,610
I know the swans from up north migrate to
Lake Matamuskeet every winter, but I guess

1569
01:36:53,610 --> 01:36:55,000
they came here this time.

1570
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,130
I don't know why.

1571
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:57,780
Maybe they got off track or something.

1572
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:59,199
They'll find their way back, though.

1573
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,340
They're driven by instinct, and this isn't
their place.

1574
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:09,340
Some of the geese may winter here, but the
swans will go back to Matamuskeet."

1575
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:12,870
Noah paddled hard as dark clouds rolled directly
overhead.

1576
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,940
Soon rain began to fall.

1577
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:17,170
Lightning... a pause... then thunder again.

1578
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:18,989
A little louder now.

1579
01:37:18,989 --> 01:37:21,720
Maybe six or seven miles away.

1580
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:27,830
More rain as Noah began to paddle even harder;
his muscles were tightening with every stroke.

1581
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:29,020
Allie watched the rainfall.

1582
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:31,389
The sky darkened a little more.

1583
01:37:31,389 --> 01:37:35,860
She leaned her head back for a moment to let
it hit her face.

1584
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:39,600
She ran her hands through her hair, feeling
its wetness.

1585
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,059
It felt wonderful, she felt wonderful.

1586
01:37:42,059 --> 01:37:46,059
Even through the rain, she could hear him
breathing hard, and the sound excited her

1587
01:37:46,059 --> 01:37:50,600
in a way she hadn't felt in years.

1588
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:56,780
A cloud burst directly above them and the
rain began to come down harder than she'd

1589
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,500
ever seen it.

1590
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:03,120
Allie looked upwards and laughed, giving up
any attempt at keeping dry, making Noah feel

1591
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,120
better.

1592
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:10,820
Even though she'd made the decision to come,
he doubted that she'd expected to be caught

1593
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:13,090
in a storm like this.

1594
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:22,130
They reached the dock a couple of minutes
later, and Noah moved in close enough for

1595
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:24,760
Allie to step out.

1596
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:37,750
He helped her up, then got out himself and
dragged the canoe up the bank, tying it to

1597
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,750
the jetty.

1598
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:44,610
When he finished and stood, Allie took his
hands in hers, surprising him.

1599
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:48,489
Despite the downpour, they didn't rush towards
the house, and Noah imagined what it would

1600
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:53,500
be like to spend the night with her.

1601
01:38:53,500 --> 01:39:03,840
Allie felt the warmth in his hands and wondered
what it would be like to have them touch her

1602
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,840
body.

1603
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:12,210
Just thinking about it made her take a deep
breath.

1604
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:13,210
She realized then that something had changed.

1605
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:23,239
And she knew that she had fallen in love with
Noah Taylor Calhoun again, and that maybe,

1606
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:26,880
just maybe, she had never stopped.

1607
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:35,239
THERE WAS no uneasiness between them as they
reached the door and went inside.

1608
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:40,039
"I think I can find something here for you
so you can get out of those clothes.

1609
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:44,010
It might be a little big, but it's warm."

1610
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,500
"Anything," she said.

1611
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,489
"I'll be back in a second."

1612
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:55,039
Noah slipped off his boots, then ran up the
stairs, descending a minute later.

1613
01:39:55,039 --> 01:40:04,250
He had a pair of cotton trousers and a long-sleeved
shirt under one arm and some jeans with a

1614
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:06,639
blue shirt in the other.

1615
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:12,400
"Here," he said, handing her the cotton trousers
and shirt.

1616
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:17,310
"You can change in the bedroom upstairs.

1617
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:24,969
There's a bathroom and towel up there too
if you want to shower."

1618
01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:38,280
She thanked him with a smile and went upstairs,
feeling his eyes on her as she walked.

1619
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:43,440
She entered the bedroom and closed the door,
then set the trousers and shirt on his bed

1620
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,440
and took everything off.

1621
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,690
She didn't want to shower after the rain.

1622
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:49,659
She liked the soft feeling on her skin.

1623
01:40:49,659 --> 01:40:53,949
She put on his clothes before looking at herself
in the mirror.

1624
01:40:53,949 --> 01:40:59,680
The trousers were big, but she rolled up the
bottoms so they wouldn't drag.

1625
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:06,610
The neck was torn a little, but she liked
the way it looked on her anyway.

1626
01:41:06,610 --> 01:41:13,820
She pulled the sleeves up almost to the elbows,
went to the chest of drawers and slipped on

1627
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:17,730
some socks, then went to the bathroom to find
a hairbrush.

1628
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:21,179
When she was finished, she went back downstairs.

1629
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:26,809
Noah was in the living room squatting before
a fire.

1630
01:41:26,809 --> 01:41:30,929
He poked the fire, moving the logs.

1631
01:41:30,929 --> 01:41:34,619
He didn't see her come in, and she watched
him as he worked.

1632
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:37,449
He had changed his clothes as well and looked
good.

1633
01:41:37,449 --> 01:41:40,530
Allie stood in the doorway and continued to
watch him.

1634
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:48,119
He caught a glimpse of her out of the comer
of his eye and looked up quickly.

1635
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:53,520
Even in his clothes, she looked beautiful.

1636
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,889
"I didn't hear you come in," he said, trying
to sound casual.

1637
01:41:58,889 --> 01:42:03,110
"How long have you been standing there?"

1638
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:05,520
"A couple of minutes."

1639
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,110
Noah pointed to the kitchen.

1640
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:13,719
"Can I get you some tea?

1641
01:42:13,719 --> 01:42:19,530
I started the water while you were upstairs."

1642
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:22,409
Small talk, anything to keep his mind clear.

1643
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:24,579
But damn, the way she looked...

1644
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:31,650
She thought for a second, and then asked,
"Do you have anything stronger, or is it too

1645
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:33,349
early to drink?"

1646
01:42:33,349 --> 01:42:39,570
He smiled and said, "I have some bourbon in
the pantry.

1647
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:40,570
Is that okay?"

1648
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:41,570
"That sounds great."

1649
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:46,460
He started towards the kitchen, and Allie
watched him run his hand through his wet hair

1650
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,599
as he disappeared.

1651
01:42:47,599 --> 01:42:50,580
Thunder boomed loudly and another downpour
started.

1652
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:56,730
Allie could hear the roaring of the rain on
the roof.

1653
01:42:56,730 --> 01:43:03,070
She took a quilt from the sofa and sat on
the rug in front of the fire.

1654
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:06,710
Crossing her legs, she adjusted the quilt
until she was comfortable and watched the

1655
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:07,710
dancing flames.

1656
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:08,780
Noah came back, and sat beside her.

1657
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:11,800
He put down two glasses and poured some bourbon
into each of them.

1658
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,440
Outside, the sky grew darker.

1659
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,440
Thunder again.

1660
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,440
Loud.

1661
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,440
The storm was in full fury.

1662
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:21,980
"It's quite a storm," Noah said as he watched
the drops flow in vertical streams on the

1663
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:22,980
windows.

1664
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:29,910
He and Allie were close now, though not touching,
and Noah watched her chest rise slightly with

1665
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:30,910
every breath.

1666
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:34,610
"I like it," she said, taking a sip.

1667
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:36,480
"I've always liked thunderstorms.

1668
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,489
Even as a young girl."

1669
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:39,489
"Why?"

1670
01:43:39,489 --> 01:43:40,489
"I don't know.

1671
01:43:40,489 --> 01:43:43,090
They just always seemed romantic to me."

1672
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:48,579
She was quiet for a moment, and Noah watched
the fire flicker in her emerald eyes.

1673
01:43:48,579 --> 01:43:55,880
Then she said, "Do you remember sitting together
and watching the storm a few nights before

1674
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:56,880
I left?"

1675
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:57,880
"Of course."

1676
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:02,500
"I used to think about it all the time after
I went home.

1677
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:06,000
I always thought about how you looked that
night.

1678
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,750
It was the way I remembered you."

1679
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,179
"Have I changed much?"

1680
01:44:11,179 --> 01:44:15,250
She took another sip of bourbon, feeling it
warm her.

1681
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:17,770
She touched his hand as she answered.

1682
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:18,770
"Not really.

1683
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:21,449
You're older, of course, with more life behind
you, but you've still got the same gleam in

1684
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:22,449
your eye.

1685
01:44:22,449 --> 01:44:25,140
You still read poetry and float on rivers.

1686
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:27,619
And you've still got a gentleness that not
even the war could take away."

1687
01:44:27,619 --> 01:44:30,489
He thought about what she'd said and felt
her hand lingering on his.

1688
01:44:30,489 --> 01:44:33,860
"Allie, you asked me earlier what I remembered
most about the summer.

1689
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,520
What do you remember?"

1690
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,350
It was a while before she answered.

1691
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:38,350
"I remember making love.

1692
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:39,470
That's what I remember most.

1693
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:46,330
You were my first, and it was more wonderful
than I ever thought it would be."

1694
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:51,239
Noah took a drink of bourbon, remembering,
bringing back the old feelings.

1695
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:54,940
She squeezed his hand, let go, and moved closer.

1696
01:44:54,940 --> 01:45:00,340
She put her hand through his arm, and rested
her head on his shoulder.

1697
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:03,190
He could smell her, soft like the rain, warm.

1698
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,210
She spoke quietly.

1699
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:06,800
"Do you remember walking home after the festival?

1700
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,469
I asked you if you wanted to see me again.

1701
01:45:10,469 --> 01:45:12,639
You just nodded your head and didn't say a
word.

1702
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:13,960
It wasn't too convincing."

1703
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,429
"I'd never met anyone like you.

1704
01:45:16,429 --> 01:45:18,890
I didn't know what to say."

1705
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:19,890
"I know.

1706
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:21,770
You could never hide anything.

1707
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:24,239
Your eyes always gave you away.

1708
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:28,030
You had the most wonderful eyes I'd ever seen."

1709
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:33,219
She lifted her head from his shoulder and
looked directly at him.

1710
01:45:33,219 --> 01:45:36,710
When she spoke, her voice was barely above
a whisper.

1711
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:43,100
"I think I loved you more that summer than
I ever loved anyone."

1712
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:44,550
Lightning flashed again.

1713
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:50,809
In the quiet moments before the thunder, their
eyes met as they tried to undo fourteen years.

1714
01:45:50,809 --> 01:45:56,190
When the thunder finally sounded, Noah sighed
and turned from her towards the windows.

1715
01:45:56,190 --> 01:46:01,559
"It's a pity you didn't read the letters I
wrote you," he said.

1716
01:46:01,559 --> 01:46:02,750
She didn't speak for a while.

1717
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:08,079
"Noah, I didn't tell you, but I wrote you
a dozen letters after I got home.

1718
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:10,489
I just never sent them."

1719
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:11,489
"Why?"

1720
01:46:11,489 --> 01:46:12,489
Noah was surprised.

1721
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:15,309
"I guess I was too afraid."

1722
01:46:15,309 --> 01:46:16,309
"Of what?"

1723
01:46:16,309 --> 01:46:21,710
"That maybe it wasn't as real as I thought
it was.

1724
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:24,580
That maybe you forgot me."

1725
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:26,219
"I would never do that.

1726
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:27,850
I couldn't even think it."

1727
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:28,850
"I know that now.

1728
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:33,760
I can see it when I look at you.

1729
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,880
But back then it was different.

1730
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:40,719
There was so much I didn't understand, things
that a young girl's mind couldn't sort out."

1731
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:41,719
"What do you mean?"

1732
01:46:41,719 --> 01:46:43,270
"When your letters never came, I didn't know
what to think.

1733
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:50,650
I remember talking to my best friend about
that summer, and she said that you had got

1734
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:55,840
what you wanted, and that she wasn't surprised
that you didn't write.

1735
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,910
I didn't believe that you were that way, I
never did, but I thought maybe the summer

1736
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:05,599
meant more to me than to you..."

1737
01:47:05,599 --> 01:47:08,469
Noah looked away and she continued.

1738
01:47:08,469 --> 01:47:11,940
"In time, the hurt began to fade and it was
easier to just let it go.

1739
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,619
At least I thought it was.

1740
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:20,530
But in every boy I met in the next few years
I was looking for you, and when the feelings

1741
01:47:20,530 --> 01:47:24,059
got too strong I wrote you another letter.

1742
01:47:24,059 --> 01:47:29,370
But I never sent them for fear of what I might
find.

1743
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:38,699
By then you'd gone on with your life and I
didn't want to think that you loved someone

1744
01:47:38,699 --> 01:47:39,699
else.

1745
01:47:39,699 --> 01:47:42,510
I wanted to remember us like we were that
summer."

1746
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:44,590
"You're better than I remembered, Allie."

1747
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:45,630
"You're sweet, Noah."

1748
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:50,969
He almost stopped there, knowing that if he
kept the words inside him he could keep control,

1749
01:47:50,969 --> 01:47:53,909
the same control he had kept the past fourteen
years.

1750
01:47:53,909 --> 01:47:59,119
But then something overtook him and he gave
in to it, hoping it would take them back to

1751
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:00,619
what they'd had so long ago.

1752
01:48:00,619 --> 01:48:02,760
"I'm not saying it because I'm sweet.

1753
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:08,320
I'm saying it because I love you now and I
always have.

1754
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,199
More than you can imagine."

1755
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:15,010
Allie took a sip of bourbon and began to feel
its effects.

1756
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:21,030
But it wasn't just the alcohol that made her
hold Noah a little tighter and feel his warmth

1757
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,030
against her.

1758
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:24,329
Glancing out of the window, she saw the clouds
were almost black.

1759
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:27,309
"Noah, you've never asked, but I want you
to know something."

1760
01:48:27,309 --> 01:48:28,949
"What is it?"

1761
01:48:28,949 --> 01:48:31,130
Her voice was tender.

1762
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:33,869
"There's never been another, Noah.

1763
01:48:33,869 --> 01:48:36,190
You weren't just the first.

1764
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:40,941
You're the only man - I've ever been with,
I don't expect you to say the same thing,

1765
01:48:40,941 --> 01:48:42,889
but I wanted you to know."

1766
01:48:42,889 --> 01:48:45,239
Noah was silent as he turned away.

1767
01:48:45,239 --> 01:48:47,199
She felt warmer as she watched the fire.

1768
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:53,489
She leaned into him and felt the heat between
them, felt his body, felt his arm tight around

1769
01:48:53,489 --> 01:48:54,489
her.

1770
01:48:54,489 --> 01:48:57,119
It felt so right to be here.

1771
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:59,190
Everything felt right.

1772
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:03,730
The fire, the drinks, the storm.

1773
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:07,010
It seemed their years apart didn't matter
anymore.

1774
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:13,770
They gave in then to everything they had fought
against for the last fourteen years.

1775
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:19,940
Allie lifted her head off his shoulder, looked
at him with hazy eyes, and Noah kissed her

1776
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:22,469
softly on the lips.

1777
01:49:22,469 --> 01:49:29,829
She brought her hand to his face and touched
his cheek, brushing it softly with her fingers.

1778
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:34,110
He leaned in and kissed her tenderly, and
she kissed back, feeling the years of separation

1779
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:35,920
dissolve into passion.

1780
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:42,889
Without speaking, she started to undo the
buttons on his shirt.

1781
01:49:42,889 --> 01:49:50,699
He watched her as she did it and listened
to her soft breaths as she made her way downwards.

1782
01:49:50,699 --> 01:49:56,120
With each button, he could feel her fingers
brushing against his skin, and she smiled

1783
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,719
softly at him when she finally finished.

1784
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:05,040
She felt short of breath as his hands gently
caressed her, and she felt their heated bodies

1785
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,900
press together, skin to skin.

1786
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:11,870
They spent the day in each other's arms, alternately
making love by the fire and then holding each

1787
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:12,880
other as they watched the flames.

1788
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:21,040
He recited his favourite poems as she lay
beside him, and she listened with her eyes

1789
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,200
closed and almost felt the words.

1790
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:26,929
Then they joined again and he murmured words
of love between kisses as they wrapped their

1791
01:50:26,929 --> 01:50:28,460
arms around one another.

1792
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:34,590
They went on throughout the evening, making
up for their years apart, and slept in each

1793
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:36,239
other's arms that night.

1794
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:43,010
Occasionally he woke up and looked at her,
and felt that everything was suddenly right

1795
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,639
in this world.

1796
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:52,610
Once, when he was looking at her in the moments
before daybreak, her eyes opened and she smiled

1797
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:55,210
and reached up to touch his face.

1798
01:50:55,210 --> 01:51:03,670
He put his fingers to her lips, gently, to
keep her from speaking, and for a long time

1799
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:06,969
they just looked at one another.

1800
01:51:06,969 --> 01:51:11,800
When the lump in his throat subsided, he whispered
to her, "You are the answer to every prayer

1801
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:12,800
I've offered.

1802
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,040
You are a song, a dream, a whisper.

1803
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:20,090
I love you, Allie, more than you can ever
imagine, I always have and I always will."

1804
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,519
"Oh, Noah," she said, pulling him to her.

1805
01:51:22,519 --> 01:51:27,760
She wanted him, needed him now more than ever,
like nothing she'd ever known.

1806
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:28,760
CHAPTER SEVEN

1807
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:31,690
AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR
LATER THAT same morning, three men - two lawyers

1808
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:35,730
and the judge - sat in a room of the courthouse
while Lon finished speaking.

1809
01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:38,750
"It's an unusual request," the judge answered,
thinking about the situation.

1810
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:43,080
"It seems to me the trial could very well
end today.

1811
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:48,400
Are you saying this matter can't wait until
later this evening or tomorrow?"

1812
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:54,429
"No, your honour, it can't," Lon answered
almost too quickly.

1813
01:51:54,429 --> 01:52:01,349
He told himself to stay relaxed.

1814
01:52:01,349 --> 01:52:04,000
He took a deep breath.

1815
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,829
"And it has nothing to do with this case?"

1816
01:52:06,829 --> 01:52:07,829
"No, your honour.

1817
01:52:07,829 --> 01:52:09,310
It's of a personal nature.

1818
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:14,460
I know it's out of the ordinary, but I really
need to take care of it."

1819
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:22,810
The judge leaned back in his chair, looking
at him for a moment, and then said, "Mr. Bates,

1820
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:25,429
how do you feel about this?"

1821
01:52:25,429 --> 01:52:27,610
The lawyer cleared his throat.

1822
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:33,300
"Mr. Hammond called me this morning and I've
already spoken to my clients.

1823
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,150
They agree to postpone until Monday."

1824
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:38,039
The judge looked hard at both of them.

1825
01:52:38,039 --> 01:52:41,300
"I don't like it," he said, "not at all.

1826
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:49,739
But Mr. Hammond has never made such a request
before, and I assume the matter is very important

1827
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:51,280
to him."

1828
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:55,989
He paused, then looked at some papers on his
desk.

1829
01:52:55,989 --> 01:53:00,500
"I'll agree to postpone until Monday; nine
o'clock sharp."

1830
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,510
"Thank you, your honour," Lon said.

1831
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:09,500
Two minutes later, he was leaving the courthouse.

1832
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:20,500
He walked to the car he had parked directly
across the street, got in and began the drive

1833
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:21,869
to New Bern.

1834
01:53:21,869 --> 01:53:24,190
His hands were shaking.

1835
01:53:24,190 --> 01:53:30,429
NOAH MADE breakfast for Allie while she slept
in the living room.

1836
01:53:30,429 --> 01:53:32,830
Bacon, rolls and coffee, nothing special.

1837
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:42,710
He set the tray beside her as she woke up,
and as soon as they had finished eating, they

1838
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,369
made love again.

1839
01:53:44,369 --> 01:53:52,080
They showered and afterwards Allie put on
her dress, which had dried overnight.

1840
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:56,010
She spent the morning with Noah.

1841
01:53:56,010 --> 01:54:02,340
Together they fed Clem and checked the windows
to make sure no damage bad been done in the

1842
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,340
storm.

1843
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:07,159
Noah held Allie's hand most of the morning
and they talked easily, but sometimes he stopped

1844
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:08,539
speaking and just stared at her.

1845
01:54:08,539 --> 01:54:14,070
When he did, she felt as though she should
say something, but nothing meaningful ever

1846
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:15,380
came into her head.

1847
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:16,739
She usually just kissed him.

1848
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:20,870
A little before noon, Noah and Allie went
in to prepare lunch.

1849
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:26,710
Using what he had, they fried some chicken
and baked many bread rolls, and the two of

1850
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:30,670
them ate on the porch, listening to the birds
singing.

1851
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:37,790
While they were inside doing the dishes, they
heard a knock at the door.

1852
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,909
Noah left Allie in the kitchen.

1853
01:54:39,909 --> 01:54:40,909
Knock, knock.

1854
01:54:40,909 --> 01:54:41,909
Louder.

1855
01:54:41,909 --> 01:54:42,909
Noah approached the door.

1856
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:43,909
Knock, knock.

1857
01:54:43,909 --> 01:54:47,449
"I'm coming," he said as he opened the door.

1858
01:54:47,449 --> 01:54:48,710
"Oh, my God."

1859
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:55,889
He stared for a moment at a beautiful woman
in her early fifties, a woman he recognized

1860
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:56,889
at once.

1861
01:54:56,889 --> 01:54:57,969
"Hello, Noah," she said.

1862
01:54:57,969 --> 01:54:58,969
Noah said nothing.

1863
01:54:58,969 --> 01:54:59,969
"May I come in?"

1864
01:54:59,969 --> 01:55:01,300
she asked; her voice was steady, showing nothing.

1865
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:07,699
He mumbled a reply as she walked past him,
stopping just before the stairs.

1866
01:55:07,699 --> 01:55:09,679
"Who is it?"

1867
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:15,849
Allie shouted from the kitchen, and the woman
turned at the sound of her voice.

1868
01:55:15,849 --> 01:55:20,199
"It's your mother," Noah finally answered,
and immediately after he said it he heard

1869
01:55:20,199 --> 01:55:21,840
the sound of breaking glass.

1870
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:30,530
"I knew you would be here," Anne Nelson said
to her daughter as the three of them sat around

1871
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:34,019
the coffee table in the living room.

1872
01:55:34,019 --> 01:55:37,019
"How could you be so sure?"

1873
01:55:37,019 --> 01:55:38,510
"You're my daughter.

1874
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:45,000
One day when you have kids of your own, you'll
know the answer."

1875
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:53,590
She smiled, but her manner was tense, and
Noah imagined how difficult this was for her.

1876
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:56,429
"I saw the article, too, and I saw your reaction.

1877
01:55:56,429 --> 01:56:00,579
I also saw how nervous you've been during
the last couple of weeks, and when you said

1878
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:04,150
you were going shopping near the coast, I
knew exactly what you meant."

1879
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:05,409
"What about daddy?"

1880
01:56:05,409 --> 01:56:12,119
Anne Nelson shook her head, "No, I didn't
tell your father or anyone else about it.

1881
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:15,739
Nor did I tell anyone where I was going today."

1882
01:56:15,739 --> 01:56:16,820
"Why did you come?"

1883
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:17,820
Allie asked.

1884
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:22,860
"I came because I had to," her mother said,
"Which I'm sure is the same reason you came.

1885
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:23,860
Am I right?"

1886
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:24,860
Allie nodded.

1887
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:25,860
Anne turned to Noah.

1888
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:29,500
"I know you don't think so, but I always liked
you.

1889
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,820
I just didn't think you were right for my
daughter.

1890
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:34,159
Can you understand that?"

1891
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:37,750
He shook his head as he answered, "No, not
really.

1892
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:41,760
It wasn't fair to me, and it wasn't fair to
Allie.

1893
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,820
Otherwise she wouldn't be here."

1894
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:53,309
She watched him as he spoke, but she said
nothing.

1895
01:56:53,309 --> 01:56:56,349
Allie, sensing an argument, cut in.

1896
01:56:56,349 --> 01:57:01,520
"What do you mean when you say you had to
come?

1897
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,599
Don't you trust me?"

1898
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:04,179
Anne turned back to her daughter.

1899
01:57:04,179 --> 01:57:05,760
"This has nothing to do with trust.

1900
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,130
This has to do with Lon.

1901
01:57:07,130 --> 01:57:16,489
He called the house last night to talk to
me about Noah, and he's on his way here right

1902
01:57:16,489 --> 01:57:17,489
now.

1903
01:57:17,489 --> 01:57:18,900
He seemed very upset.

1904
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,800
I thought you'd want to know."

1905
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:23,239
Allie inhaled sharply.

1906
01:57:23,239 --> 01:57:25,170
"He's on his way?"

1907
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:26,619
"As we speak.

1908
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:30,340
He arranged to have the trial postponed until
next week.

1909
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:33,530
If he's not in New Bern yet, he's close."

1910
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:35,949
"What did you say to him?"

1911
01:57:35,949 --> 01:57:36,949
"Not much.

1912
01:57:36,949 --> 01:57:37,969
But he guessed.

1913
01:57:37,969 --> 01:57:42,130
He remembered my telling him about Noah a
long time ago."

1914
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:48,619
Allie swallowed hard, and then asked, "Did
you tell him I was here?"

1915
01:57:48,619 --> 01:57:49,619
"No.

1916
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:50,619
And I won't.

1917
01:57:50,619 --> 01:57:53,110
That's between you and him.

1918
01:57:53,110 --> 01:57:57,099
But knowing him, I'm sure he'll find you.

1919
01:57:57,099 --> 01:58:09,769
All it takes is a couple of phone calls to
the right people.

1920
01:58:09,769 --> 01:58:17,659
After all, I was able to find you."

1921
01:58:17,659 --> 01:58:22,119
Allie, though obviously tired, smiled at her
mother.

1922
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:31,139
"Thank you," she said, and her mother reached
for her hand.

1923
01:58:31,139 --> 01:58:39,900
"I know we've had our differences, Allie,
and that we haven't seen eye to eye on everything.

1924
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:45,559
But I'm your mother and that means I'll always
love you."

1925
01:58:45,559 --> 01:58:49,349
Allie was silent for a moment, and then asked,
"What should I do?"

1926
01:58:49,349 --> 01:58:50,530
"I don't know, Allie.

1927
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:51,889
That's up to you.

1928
01:58:51,889 --> 01:58:54,219
But I would think about it.

1929
01:58:54,219 --> 01:58:56,550
Think about what you really want."

1930
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:59,400
Allie turned away, her eyes were reddening.

1931
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:04,199
A moment later, a tear drifted down her cheek.

1932
01:59:04,199 --> 01:59:05,789
"I don't know..."

1933
01:59:05,789 --> 01:59:08,460
Her mother squeezed her hand.

1934
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:15,909
Anne looked at Noah, who had been sitting
with his head down, listening carefully.

1935
01:59:15,909 --> 01:59:22,210
As if reading her mind, he returned her gaze,
nodded and left the room.

1936
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:26,980
When he was gone, Anne whispered, "Do you
love him?"

1937
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:30,789
"Yes, I do," Allie answered softly, "very
much."

1938
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:32,699
"Do you love Lon?"

1939
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:34,130
"Yes, I do.

1940
01:59:34,130 --> 01:59:36,030
I love him, too.

1941
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:38,889
Dearly, but in a different way.

1942
01:59:38,889 --> 01:59:42,090
He doesn't make me feel the way Noah does."

1943
01:59:42,090 --> 01:59:48,329
"No one will ever do that," her mother said,
and she released Allie's hand.

1944
01:59:48,329 --> 01:59:54,659
"I can't make this decision for you, Allie,
this one's all yours.

1945
01:59:54,659 --> 01:59:59,940
I want you to know, though, that I love you.

1946
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:00,940
And I always will.

1947
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:03,409
I know that doesn't help, but it's all I can
do."

1948
02:00:03,409 --> 02:00:09,960
She reached in her handbag and removed a packet
of letters held together with string; the

1949
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,170
envelopes were old and slightly yellowed.

1950
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:15,840
"These are the letters that Noah wrote to
you.

1951
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:21,139
I never threw them away, and I didn't open
them.

1952
02:00:21,139 --> 02:00:27,369
I know, it was wrong of me to keep them from
you, and I'm sorry for that.

1953
02:00:27,369 --> 02:00:29,219
But I was just trying to protect you.

1954
02:00:29,219 --> 02:00:30,340
I didn't realize..."

1955
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:34,070
Allie took them and ran her hand over them,
shocked.

1956
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:35,560
"I should go, Allie.

1957
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:40,040
You've got some decisions to make, and you
don't have much time.

1958
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:43,409
Do you want me to stay in town?"

1959
02:00:43,409 --> 02:00:47,910
Allie shook her head, "No, this is up to me."

1960
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:57,889
Anne nodded and watched her daughter for a
moment.

1961
02:00:57,889 --> 02:01:02,699
Finally, she stood, went around the table,
leaned over and kissed Allie on the cheek.

1962
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:08,630
She could see the confusion in her daughter's
eyes as Allie embraced her.

1963
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:13,409
They stood together for another minute, just
holding each other.

1964
02:01:13,409 --> 02:01:17,050
"Thanks for coming," Allie said, "I love you."

1965
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:19,130
"I love you too."

1966
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:26,280
As her mother left the living room, Allie
thought that she heard her whisper, "Follow

1967
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:28,889
your heart," but she couldn't be sure.

1968
02:01:28,889 --> 02:01:32,559
NOAH OPENED the door for Anne Nelson as she
went out.

1969
02:01:32,559 --> 02:01:35,110
"Goodbye Noah," she said quietly.

1970
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:37,150
He nodded without speaking.

1971
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:42,239
There wasn't anything else to say; they both
knew that.

1972
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:47,840
She turned from him and left, closing the
door behind her.

1973
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,650
Noah watched her leave without looking back.

1974
02:01:52,650 --> 02:02:01,900
She was a strong woman, he thought to himself,
and he knew then where Allie got it.

1975
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:09,250
Noah peeped into the living room, saw Allie
sitting with her head down, then went to the

1976
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:13,800
back porch, knowing that she needed to be
alone.

1977
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:18,860
He sat quietly in his rocker and watched the
water.

1978
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,309
After a while, he heard the back door open.

1979
02:02:22,309 --> 02:02:27,252
He didn't turn to look at her - for some reason
he couldn't - and he listened as she sat in

1980
02:02:27,252 --> 02:02:28,252
the chair beside him.

1981
02:02:28,252 --> 02:02:29,252
"I'm sorry," Allie said, "I had no idea this
would happen."

1982
02:02:29,252 --> 02:02:30,252
Noah shook his head.

1983
02:02:30,252 --> 02:02:31,252
"Don't be sorry.

1984
02:02:31,252 --> 02:02:35,489
We both knew it was coming to some form or
another."

1985
02:02:35,489 --> 02:02:37,219
"It's still hard."

1986
02:02:37,219 --> 02:02:38,380
"I know."

1987
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:40,590
He finally turned to her, reaching for her
hand.

1988
02:02:40,590 --> 02:02:48,650
"Is here anything I can do to make it easier?"

1989
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:49,650
She shook her head.

1990
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,650
"No.

1991
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:51,650
Not really.

1992
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:53,110
I have to do this alone.

1993
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:57,750
Besides, I'm not sure what I'm going to say
to him yet."

1994
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:02,659
She looked down and her voice became softer.

1995
02:03:02,659 --> 02:03:10,480
"I guess it depends on him and how much he
knows.

1996
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:17,690
If my mother was right, he may have suspicions,
but he doesn't know anything for sure."

1997
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:20,079
Noah felt tightness in his stomach.

1998
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:26,960
When he finally spoke his voice was steady,
but she could hear the pain in it.

1999
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:34,520
"You're not going to tell him about us, are
you?"

2000
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,280
"I don't know.

2001
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:38,039
I really don't.

2002
02:03:38,039 --> 02:03:50,030
While I was in the living room, I was asking
myself what I really wanted in my life."

2003
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:52,280
She squeezed his hand.

2004
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:58,280
"And do you know what the answer was?

2005
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,749
The answer was that I want you.

2006
02:04:02,749 --> 02:04:03,780
I want us.

2007
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:06,190
I love you and I always have."

2008
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:09,739
She took a deep breath before going on.

2009
02:04:09,739 --> 02:04:15,269
"But I also want a happy ending without hurting
anyone.

2010
02:04:15,269 --> 02:04:19,369
And I know that if I stayed, people would
be hurt.

2011
02:04:19,369 --> 02:04:20,369
Especially Lon.

2012
02:04:20,369 --> 02:04:24,480
I wasn't lying when I told you that I love
him.

2013
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:32,350
He doesn't make me feel the same way you do,
but I care for him, and this wouldn't be fair

2014
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:33,350
to him.

2015
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:36,560
Staying here would also hurt my family and
friends.

2016
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:44,820
I would betray everyone I know... I don't
know if I can do that."

2017
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:49,530
"You can't live your life for other people.

2018
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:56,719
You've got to do what's right for you, even
if it hurts some people you love."

2019
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,820
"I know," she said, "but no matter what I
choose I have to live with it.

2020
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:01,820
Forever.

2021
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:05,960
I have to be able to go forward and not look
back any more.

2022
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:07,920
Can you understand that?"

2023
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:12,420
He shook his head and tried to keep his voice
steady.

2024
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:13,420
"Not really.

2025
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:14,420
Not if it means losing you.

2026
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:15,630
I can't do that again."

2027
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:18,059
She didn't say anything but lowered her head.

2028
02:05:18,059 --> 02:05:21,389
Noah went on, "Could you really leave me without
looking back?"

2029
02:05:21,389 --> 02:05:23,520
She bit her lip as she answered.

2030
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,520
"I don't know.

2031
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:25,520
Probably not."

2032
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:26,690
"Would that be fair to Lon?"

2033
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:27,690
She didn't answer.

2034
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:33,099
Instead, she stood up, wiped her face and
walked to the edge of the porch where she

2035
02:05:33,099 --> 02:05:37,239
leaned against the post and watched the water
before answering quietly: "No."

2036
02:05:37,239 --> 02:05:39,829
"It doesn't have to be like this, Allie,"
he said.

2037
02:05:39,829 --> 02:05:40,829
"We're adults now, we have the choice we didn't
have before.

2038
02:05:40,829 --> 02:05:41,829
We're meant to be together.

2039
02:05:41,829 --> 02:05:42,829
We always have been."

2040
02:05:42,829 --> 02:05:44,320
He walked to her side and put his hand on
her shoulder.

2041
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,380
"I don't want to live the rest of my life
thinking about you and dreaming of something

2042
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:47,380
that never happened.

2043
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,770
Stay with me, Allie."

2044
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:50,260
Tears filled her eyes.

2045
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:53,239
"I don't know if I can," she whispered.

2046
02:05:53,239 --> 02:05:54,360
"You can, Allie...

2047
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:58,460
I can't live my life happily knowing you're
with someone else.

2048
02:05:58,460 --> 02:06:01,060
That would kill a part of me.

2049
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,929
What we have is rare.

2050
02:06:02,929 --> 02:06:05,361
It's too beautiful to just throw it away."

2051
02:06:05,361 --> 02:06:09,840
After a moment, he gently turned her towards
him, took her hands and stared at her.

2052
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,350
Allie finally faced him with wet eyes.

2053
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:17,440
After a long silence, Noah brushed the tears
from her cheeks with his fingers.

2054
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:20,910
He saw what her eyes were telling him.

2055
02:06:20,910 --> 02:06:23,960
"You're not going to stay, are you?"

2056
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,260
He smiled weakly.

2057
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:27,869
"You want to, but you can't."

2058
02:06:27,869 --> 02:06:32,119
"Oh, Noah," she said as the tears began again,
"try to understand-"

2059
02:06:32,119 --> 02:06:36,100
He shook his head to stop her.

2060
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:45,730
"I know what you're trying to say - I can
see it in your eyes.

2061
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:50,710
But I don't want to understand it, Allie.

2062
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:55,159
I don't want it to end this way.

2063
02:06:55,159 --> 02:06:58,100
I don't want it to end at all.

2064
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:01,210
But if you leave, we both know we'll never
see each other again."

2065
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:09,719
She leaned into him and began to cry harder
as Noah fought back his own tears.

2066
02:07:09,719 --> 02:07:12,269
He wrapped his arms around her.

2067
02:07:12,269 --> 02:07:16,570
"Allie, I can't force you to stay with me.

2068
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:24,690
But no matter what happens in my life, I'll
never forget these last couple of days with

2069
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:25,690
you.

2070
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:28,519
I've been dreaming about this for years."

2071
02:07:28,519 --> 02:07:36,239
He kissed her gently, and they embraced as
they had when she first got out of her car

2072
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:37,239
two days ago.

2073
02:07:37,239 --> 02:07:39,030
Finally, Allie let him go and wiped her tears.

2074
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:41,320
"I have to get my things, Noah."

2075
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,239
He didn't go inside with her.

2076
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:46,429
Instead, he sat down in the rocker, exhausted.

2077
02:07:46,429 --> 02:07:53,039
He watched her go into the house and listened
as the sound of her movements faded away.

2078
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:56,849
She emerged minutes later with everything
she'd brought and walked towards him with

2079
02:07:56,849 --> 02:07:57,849
her head down.

2080
02:07:57,849 --> 02:08:00,670
She handed him the drawing she had done yesterday
morning.

2081
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:01,670
"Here, Noah.

2082
02:08:01,670 --> 02:08:02,710
I made this for you."

2083
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:07,500
Noah took the drawing and unrolled it slowly.

2084
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,780
The image in the foreground was a picture
of how he looked now.

2085
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:11,540
Noah noticed that she had depicted every detail
of his face.

2086
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:15,659
It was almost as if she'd copied it from a
recent photograph.

2087
02:08:15,659 --> 02:08:19,599
The second image was the front of the house.

2088
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:26,139
The detail there was also incredible, as if
she had sketched it while sitting beneath

2089
02:08:26,139 --> 02:08:27,369
the oak tree.

2090
02:08:27,369 --> 02:08:28,369
"It's beautiful, Allie.

2091
02:08:28,369 --> 02:08:29,369
Thank you."

2092
02:08:29,369 --> 02:08:30,369
He attempted a smile.

2093
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:36,659
"I told you that you were an artist."

2094
02:08:36,659 --> 02:08:39,030
She nodded with her lips pressed together.

2095
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:41,800
It was time for her to go.

2096
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:45,340
They walked to her car slowly, without speaking.

2097
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:54,960
When they reached it, Noah embraced her again
until he could feel the tears in his own eyes.

2098
02:08:54,960 --> 02:09:00,170
He kissed her lips and both cheeks, then with
his finger softly brushed the places he'd

2099
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:01,170
kissed.

2100
02:09:01,170 --> 02:09:02,170
"I love you, Allie."

2101
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:03,170
"I love you, too."

2102
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:06,860
Noah opened her car door and they kissed one
more time.

2103
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:11,020
Then she slid behind the wheel, never taking
her eyes from him.

2104
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:18,800
She put the packet of letters and her handbag
next to her on the seat and took the keys,

2105
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:21,940
then started the engine.

2106
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:24,289
It was almost time.

2107
02:09:24,289 --> 02:09:30,539
Noah pushed her door closed with both hands
and Allie rolled down the window.

2108
02:09:30,539 --> 02:09:38,520
She reached out her hand and Noah took it
for just a moment, moving his fingers softly

2109
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:41,670
against her skin.

2110
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:52,909
"Stay with me," Noah mouthed without sound,
and this for some reason hurt more than Allie

2111
02:09:52,909 --> 02:09:53,909
could expect.

2112
02:09:53,909 --> 02:09:59,210
The tears began to fall hard now, but she
couldn't speak.

2113
02:09:59,210 --> 02:10:04,130
Reluctantly, she looked away and pulled her
hand from his.

2114
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:09,050
He fell into an almost trancelike state as
he watched the car roll slowly forwards.

2115
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:18,309
Slowly it turned towards the road that would
take her back to town.

2116
02:10:18,309 --> 02:10:21,630
Noah felt dizzy at the sight.

2117
02:10:21,630 --> 02:10:24,949
"Don't go!" he wanted to shout.

2118
02:10:24,949 --> 02:10:36,110
But he didn't say anything, and a minute later
the only remaining signs of her were the tracks

2119
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:37,161
that her car had left behind.

2120
02:10:37,161 --> 02:10:39,150
She was gone.

2121
02:10:39,150 --> 02:10:41,460
Forever this time.

2122
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:42,460
Forever.

2123
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:45,300
He closed his eyes.

2124
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:52,559
DRIVING WITH TEARS in her eyes was difficult,
but Allie went on anyway.

2125
02:10:52,559 --> 02:10:58,599
She kept the window rolled down, thinking
the fresh air might help clear her mind.

2126
02:10:58,599 --> 02:11:04,630
By the time she reached Front Street, she
had herself a little more under control.

2127
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:13,640
Traffic was light and she had time to watch
strangers going about their business as she

2128
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,600
drove through New Bern.

2129
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:26,159
She saw the inn just up the street drove slowly
until she reached the parking lot.

2130
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:30,760
She turned in and saw Lon's car sitting in
the first spot.

2131
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:40,140
Although the one next to it was open, she
passed it and picked a spot a little further

2132
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:42,840
from the entrance.

2133
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:52,429
She turned off the engine, then reached into
the glove compartment for a mirror and brush.

2134
02:11:52,429 --> 02:12:00,670
Looking at herself, she saw her eyes were
still red and swollen.

2135
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:09,980
She took her purse, opened it, and once again
looked at the article that had brought her

2136
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:11,380
here.

2137
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:15,300
It felt impossible to her that she had arrived
only the day before yesterday.

2138
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:19,969
It seemed like a lifetime since her dinner
with Noah.

2139
02:12:19,969 --> 02:12:33,520
She remembered the letters her mother had
given her and reached for them.

2140
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:41,320
She untied the package and found the first
letter he had written her.

2141
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:47,400
She began to open it, then stopped because
she could imagine what was in it.

2142
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:51,289
Something simple, no doubt - things he'd done,
memories of the summer, perhaps some questions.

2143
02:12:51,289 --> 02:12:57,640
Instead, she reached for the last letter,
the one on the bottom of the stack.

2144
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:58,640
The goodbye letter.

2145
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:00,489
This one interested her far more.

2146
02:13:00,489 --> 02:13:03,460
How had he said it?

2147
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:05,199
The envelope was thin.

2148
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:06,860
One, maybe two pages.

2149
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:08,600
The letter wasn't too long.

2150
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:12,070
She turned it over and checked the back.

2151
02:13:12,070 --> 02:13:15,349
No name, just a street address in New Jersey.

2152
02:13:15,349 --> 02:13:16,809
She held her breath.

2153
02:13:16,809 --> 02:13:20,090
Unfolding it, she saw it was dated March 1935.

2154
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:23,019
Two and a half years without a reply.

2155
02:13:23,019 --> 02:13:24,340
She began to read.

2156
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:25,340
My dearest Allie,

2157
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:31,030
I don't know what to say any more except that
I couldn't sleep last night because I knew

2158
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:33,140
that it is over between us.

2159
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:37,210
It is a different feeling for me, one that
I never expected.

2160
02:13:37,210 --> 02:13:41,320
Looking back, I suppose it is a natural ending
of our story.

2161
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:42,320
You and I were different.

2162
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:45,909
We came from different worlds, and yet you
were the one who taught me the value of love.

2163
02:13:45,909 --> 02:13:51,239
You showed me what it was like to care for
another, and I am a better man because of

2164
02:13:51,239 --> 02:13:52,239
it.

2165
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:55,090
I don't want you ever to forget that.

2166
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:58,929
I am not bitter because of what has happened.

2167
02:13:58,929 --> 02:14:06,869
I am happy we were able to come together for
even a short time.

2168
02:14:06,869 --> 02:14:12,349
And if, in some distant place in the future,
we see each other in our new lives, I will

2169
02:14:12,349 --> 02:14:17,369
smile at you with joy, and remember how we
spent a summer learning from each other and

2170
02:14:17,369 --> 02:14:18,369
growing in love.

2171
02:14:18,369 --> 02:14:23,389
And maybe, for a brief moment, you'll feel
it too, and you'll smile back and enjoy the

2172
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:26,150
memories we will always share.

2173
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:28,360
I love you, Allie.

2174
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:29,360
Noah

2175
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:34,869
She read the letter again, then put it back
into the envelope.

2176
02:14:34,869 --> 02:14:37,559
She knew she couldn't delay any longer.

2177
02:14:37,559 --> 02:14:39,480
Lon was waiting for her.

2178
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:43,710
Her legs felt weak as she stepped out of the
car.

2179
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:49,940
She paused and took a deep breath, and as
she started across the parking lot, she realized

2180
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:56,929
that she still wasn't sure what she was going
to say to him.

2181
02:14:56,929 --> 02:15:08,570
And the answer didn't finally come until she
reached the door and opened it and saw Lon

2182
02:15:08,570 --> 02:15:09,960
standing in the lobby.

2183
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:10,960
CHAPTER EIGHT

2184
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:14,969
WINTER FOR TWO
THE STORY ends there, so I close the notebook,

2185
02:15:14,969 --> 02:15:17,929
remove my glasses and wipe my eyes.

2186
02:15:17,929 --> 02:15:24,080
I look at her now that I have finished, but
she does not look back.

2187
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:29,059
Instead, she is staring out of the window
at the courtyard, where friends and family

2188
02:15:29,059 --> 02:15:30,059
meet.

2189
02:15:30,059 --> 02:15:36,869
I read to her this morning, as I do every
morning, because it is something I must do.

2190
02:15:36,869 --> 02:15:41,199
Not for duty but for another, more romantic
reason.

2191
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:49,369
I wish I could explain it more fully right
now, but it's still early, and talking about

2192
02:15:49,369 --> 02:15:55,630
romance isn't really possible before lunch
any more, at least not for me.

2193
02:15:55,630 --> 02:16:00,280
Besides, I have no idea how it's going to
turn out.

2194
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:03,900
We spend every day together now, but our nights
are spent alone.

2195
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:08,570
The doctors tell me that I'm not allowed to
see her after dark.

2196
02:16:08,570 --> 02:16:16,289
I understand the reasons, and though I agree
with them completely I sometimes break the

2197
02:16:16,289 --> 02:16:17,289
rules.

2198
02:16:17,289 --> 02:16:27,139
Late at night when my mood is right, I leave
my room and go to hers and watch her while

2199
02:16:27,139 --> 02:16:28,260
she sleeps.

2200
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:30,090
Of this, she knows nothing.

2201
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:38,920
I come in and see her breathe and know that,
had it not been for her, I would never have

2202
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:39,920
married.

2203
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:46,319
And when I look at her face, I know that I
have meant as much to her.

2204
02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:50,710
And that means more to me than I could ever
hope to explain.

2205
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:57,490
Sometimes, when I am standing there, I think
about how lucky I am to have been married

2206
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:59,880
to her for almost forty-nine years.

2207
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:04,649
She heard me snore for the first forty-five
years, but since then we have slept in separate

2208
02:17:04,649 --> 02:17:05,649
rooms.

2209
02:17:05,649 --> 02:17:06,969
I do not sleep well without her.

2210
02:17:06,969 --> 02:17:11,540
I turn and yearn for her warmth and lie there
most of the night, with my eyes open wide,

2211
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:13,330
watching the shadows on the ceiling.

2212
02:17:13,330 --> 02:17:17,960
I sleep two hours if I am lucky, and still
I wake before dawn.

2213
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:22,860
I shuffle towards her and sit in the chair
beside her bed.

2214
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:25,590
My back aches when I sit.

2215
02:17:25,590 --> 02:17:31,050
I reach for her hand and take it; it's bony
and fragile.

2216
02:17:31,050 --> 02:17:32,420
It feels nice.

2217
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:36,939
She responds - gradually her thumb begins
to rub my finger softly.

2218
02:17:36,939 --> 02:17:41,479
I do not speak until she does; this I have
learned.

2219
02:17:41,479 --> 02:17:45,739
Most days I sit in silence until the sun goes
down.

2220
02:17:45,739 --> 02:17:49,090
Minutes pass before she finally turns to me.

2221
02:17:49,090 --> 02:17:50,349
She is crying.

2222
02:17:50,349 --> 02:17:54,960
I smile and release her hand, then reach in
my pocket.

2223
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:58,929
I take out a handkerchief and wipe at her
tears.

2224
02:17:58,929 --> 02:18:03,952
She looks at me as I do so, and I wonder what
she is thinking.

2225
02:18:03,952 --> 02:18:05,309
"That was a beautiful story."

2226
02:18:05,309 --> 02:18:07,809
A light rain begins to fall.

2227
02:18:07,809 --> 02:18:10,649
Little drops tap gently on the window.

2228
02:18:10,649 --> 02:18:13,219
I take her hand again.

2229
02:18:13,219 --> 02:18:17,739
It is going to be a good day, a very good
day.

2230
02:18:17,739 --> 02:18:18,870
A magical day.

2231
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:19,870
I smile.

2232
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:21,290
"Yes, it is," I tell her.

2233
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:22,580
"Did you write it?"

2234
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:25,149
she asks; her voice is like a whisper.

2235
02:18:25,149 --> 02:18:26,149
"Yes," I answer.

2236
02:18:26,149 --> 02:18:27,609
She turns towards the nightstand.

2237
02:18:27,609 --> 02:18:29,670
Her medicine is in a little cup.

2238
02:18:29,670 --> 02:18:30,849
Mine too.

2239
02:18:30,849 --> 02:18:38,021
Little pills, their colours are like a rainbow
so we won't forget to take them.

2240
02:18:38,021 --> 02:18:42,670
The nurses bring my pills here to her room
now.

2241
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:45,649
"I've heard it before, haven't I?"

2242
02:18:45,649 --> 02:18:50,609
"Yes," I say again, just as I do every time.

2243
02:18:50,609 --> 02:18:52,770
I have learned to be patient.

2244
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:54,719
She studies my face.

2245
02:18:54,719 --> 02:18:58,620
Her eyes are as green as ocean waves.

2246
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:01,900
"It makes me feel less afraid," she says.

2247
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,679
"I know," I nod.

2248
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:06,460
She turns away, and I wait some more.

2249
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:09,309
She releases my hand and reaches for her water
glass.

2250
02:19:09,309 --> 02:19:10,440
She takes a sip.

2251
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:11,860
"Is it a true story?"

2252
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:16,689
She sits up a little in her bed and takes
another drink.

2253
02:19:16,689 --> 02:19:18,819
Her body is still strong.

2254
02:19:18,819 --> 02:19:21,800
"I mean, did you know these people?"

2255
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:23,510
"Yes," I say again.

2256
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:26,910
I could say more, but usually I don't.

2257
02:19:26,910 --> 02:19:28,609
She is still beautiful.

2258
02:19:28,609 --> 02:19:30,319
She asks the obvious.

2259
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:33,309
"Well, which one did she finally marry?"

2260
02:19:33,309 --> 02:19:37,389
I answer, "The one who was right for her."

2261
02:19:37,389 --> 02:19:38,719
"Which one was that?"

2262
02:19:38,719 --> 02:19:39,719
I smile.

2263
02:19:39,719 --> 02:19:43,569
"You'll know," I say quietly, "by the end
of the day.

2264
02:19:43,569 --> 02:19:44,569
You'll know."

2265
02:19:44,569 --> 02:19:46,920
She does not question me further.

2266
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:49,010
Instead, she begins to fidget.

2267
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:54,489
She is thinking of a way to ask me another
question, though she isn't sure how to do

2268
02:19:54,489 --> 02:19:55,489
it.

2269
02:19:55,489 --> 02:19:57,810
"I have to ask you something else," she says
finally.

2270
02:19:57,810 --> 02:19:59,660
"Whatever it is, I'll try to answer."

2271
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:00,660
"It's hard, though."

2272
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:04,670
She does not look at me and I cannot see her
eyes.

2273
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:07,580
This is how she hides her thoughts.

2274
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:09,040
Some things never change.

2275
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,870
"Take your time," I say.

2276
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:13,060
I know what she will ask.

2277
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:16,090
She turns to me and looks into my eyes.

2278
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:21,760
She offers a gentle smile, the kind you share
with a child, not a lover.

2279
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:27,230
"I don't want to hurt your feelings because
you've been so nice to me, but..."

2280
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:28,230
I wait.

2281
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:30,010
Her words will hurt me.

2282
02:20:30,010 --> 02:20:34,300
They will tear a piece from my heart and leave
a scar.

2283
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:35,300
"Who are you?"

2284
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:37,689
WE HAVE LIVED at the nursing home for three
years now.

2285
02:20:37,689 --> 02:20:43,220
It was her decision to come here, because
she thought it would be easier for me.

2286
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:47,310
We signed some papers, and received a place
to live and die in exchange for some of the

2287
02:20:47,310 --> 02:20:50,340
freedom for which we had worked a lifetime.

2288
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:54,399
She was right to do this, of course.

2289
02:20:54,399 --> 02:21:01,569
There is no way I could make it alone, for
sickness has come to us, both of us.

2290
02:21:01,569 --> 02:21:06,109
We are in the final minutes of our lives,
and the clock is ticking.

2291
02:21:06,109 --> 02:21:07,109
Loudly.

2292
02:21:07,109 --> 02:21:10,470
I wonder if I am the only one who can hear
it.

2293
02:21:10,470 --> 02:21:16,970
A burning pain courses through my fingers,
and it reminds me that we have not held hands

2294
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:19,530
with fingers interlocked since we moved here.

2295
02:21:19,530 --> 02:21:23,510
I am sad about this, but it is my fault, not
hers.

2296
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:25,311
It is arthritis in the worst form.

2297
02:21:25,311 --> 02:21:30,990
But every day I take her hands despite the
pain, and I do my best to hold them because

2298
02:21:30,990 --> 02:21:33,260
that is what she wants me to do.

2299
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:37,899
Although the Bible says man can live to be
a hundred and twenty years old, I don't want

2300
02:21:37,899 --> 02:21:38,899
to.

2301
02:21:38,899 --> 02:21:39,950
My body is falling apart.

2302
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:43,260
My kidneys are beginning to fail and my heart
rate is decreasing every month.

2303
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:45,729
What is worse, I have cancer again, this time
of the prostate.

2304
02:21:45,729 --> 02:21:51,080
This is my third battle with the unseen enemy,
and it will take me eventually, though not

2305
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:52,859
till I say it is time.

2306
02:21:52,859 --> 02:21:57,109
The doctors are worried about me, but I am
not.

2307
02:21:57,109 --> 02:22:00,100
I have no time for worry now.

2308
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:07,760
Of our five children, four are still living,
and though it is hard for them to visit, they

2309
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:11,170
come often, and for this, I am thankful.

2310
02:22:11,170 --> 02:22:18,190
But even when they aren't here, they come
alive in my mind every day, each of them,

2311
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:21,521
and they bring to mind the smiles and tears
that come with raising a family.

2312
02:22:21,521 --> 02:22:25,200
There are many pictures on the walls of my
room.

2313
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:28,510
My children are my contribution to the world.

2314
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:29,880
I am very proud.

2315
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:36,050
Sometimes I wonder what my wife thinks of
them as she dreams, or if she thinks of them

2316
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:38,050
at all, or if she even dreams.

2317
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:41,680
There is so much about her I don't understand
anymore.

2318
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,311
"My name," I say, "is Duke."

2319
02:22:44,311 --> 02:22:47,330
I have always been a John Wayne fan.

2320
02:22:47,330 --> 02:22:49,850
"Duke," she whispers to herself, "Duke."

2321
02:22:49,850 --> 02:22:52,279
She thinks for a moment.

2322
02:22:52,279 --> 02:22:55,200
"Yes," I say, "I'm here for you."

2323
02:22:55,200 --> 02:23:00,109
And always will be, I think to myself.

2324
02:23:00,109 --> 02:23:01,870
She flushes with my answer.

2325
02:23:01,870 --> 02:23:05,060
Her eyes become wet and red, and tears begin
to fall.

2326
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:10,649
My heart aches for her, but there is nothing
I could do.

2327
02:23:10,649 --> 02:23:11,649
She says, "I'm sorry.

2328
02:23:11,649 --> 02:23:14,640
I don't understand anything that's happening
to me right now.

2329
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,640
Even you.

2330
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:20,260
When I listen to you talk I feel like I should
know you, but I don't.

2331
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:22,200
I don't even know my name."

2332
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:25,530
She wipes at her tears and says, "Help me,
Duke, help me remember who I am.

2333
02:23:25,530 --> 02:23:27,280
Or at least, who I was.

2334
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:28,770
I feel so lost."

2335
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:33,609
I answer from my heart, but I lie to her about
her name.

2336
02:23:33,609 --> 02:23:35,840
As I have about my own.

2337
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,070
There is a reason for this.

2338
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:41,970
"You are Hannah, a lover of life, a loyal
friend.

2339
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:47,489
You are a dream, a creator of happiness, an
artist who has touched a thousand souls.

2340
02:23:47,489 --> 02:23:53,780
You've led a full life and wanted for nothing,
because your needs are spiritual and you have

2341
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:55,640
only to look inside you.

2342
02:23:55,640 --> 02:24:00,870
You are kind, and you are able to see beauty
where others do not.

2343
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:07,149
You are a teacher of wonderful lessons, a
dreamer of better things."

2344
02:24:07,149 --> 02:24:10,000
She does not respond.

2345
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,120
Instead, she stares at me for a long while,
until our breathing coincides.

2346
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,120
In.

2347
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:17,120
Out.

2348
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:18,120
In.

2349
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:19,120
Out.

2350
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,120
In.

2351
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:21,120
Out.

2352
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:22,120
Deep breaths.

2353
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:23,120
I wonder if she knows I think she's beautiful.

2354
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,580
"Would you stay with me a while?"

2355
02:24:24,580 --> 02:24:25,771
she finally asks.

2356
02:24:25,771 --> 02:24:28,140
I smile and nod.

2357
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:29,569
She smiles back.

2358
02:24:29,569 --> 02:24:38,310
She reaches for my hand, takes it gently and
pulls it to her waist.

2359
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:43,890
She stares at the knots that deform my fingers
and touches them gently.

2360
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:47,319
Her hands are still those of an angel.

2361
02:24:47,319 --> 02:24:53,880
"Come," I say as I stand with great effort,
"let's go for a walk.

2362
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:57,950
The air is fresh and the birds are waiting.

2363
02:24:57,950 --> 02:24:59,109
It's beautiful today."

2364
02:24:59,109 --> 02:25:02,960
I am staring at her as I say these last few
words.

2365
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:03,960
She blushes.

2366
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:07,560
It makes me feel young again.

2367
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:10,540
SHE WAS FAMOUS, of course.

2368
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:18,100
One of the best southern painters of the twentieth
century, some said, and I was, and am, proud

2369
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:19,100
of her.

2370
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:22,790
Her paintings are in museums around the world,
but I have kept only two for myself.

2371
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:25,910
The first one she ever gave me and the last
one.

2372
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:33,600
They hang in my room, and late at night I
sit and stare and sometimes cry when I look

2373
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:34,600
at them.

2374
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:35,600
I don't know why.

2375
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:37,130
And so the years passed.

2376
02:25:37,130 --> 02:25:40,370
We led our lives, working, painting, raising
children, loving each other.

2377
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:43,940
I see photos of Christmases, family trips,
of graduations and of weddings.

2378
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:46,060
I see grandchildren and happy faces.

2379
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,840
I see photos of us, our hair growing whiter,
the lines in our faces deeper.

2380
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:51,020
A lifetime that seems so typical, yet uncommon.

2381
02:25:51,020 --> 02:25:53,790
We could not foresee the future, but who can?

2382
02:25:53,790 --> 02:25:56,729
I do not live now as I expected to.

2383
02:25:56,729 --> 02:25:58,359
But I am not bitter.

2384
02:25:58,359 --> 02:26:02,920
Our lives can't be measured by our final years,
of this I am sure.

2385
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:07,189
Looking back, I suppose it seems obvious,
but at first, I thought her confusion understandable

2386
02:26:07,189 --> 02:26:09,489
and not unique.

2387
02:26:09,489 --> 02:26:15,000
She would forget where she placed her keys,
but who has not done that?

2388
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:22,391
She would forget a neighbour's name, but not
someone we knew well or with whom we socialized.

2389
02:26:22,391 --> 02:26:29,640
Sometimes she would write the wrong year when
she made out her cheques, but again I took

2390
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:33,450
it for simple mistakes that one makes when
thinking of other things.

2391
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:37,740
But when the more obvious events occurred
I began to suspect the worst.

2392
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:41,479
An iron in the freezer, clothes in the dishwasher,
books in the oven.

2393
02:26:41,479 --> 02:26:42,899
Other things, too.

2394
02:26:42,899 --> 02:26:50,109
But the day I found her in the car three blocks
away, crying because she couldn't find her

2395
02:26:50,109 --> 02:26:53,380
way home, was the first day I was really frightened.

2396
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:59,160
And she was frightened, too, for when I tapped
on her window, she turned to me and said,

2397
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:00,160
"Oh God, what's happening to me?

2398
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,160
Please help me."

2399
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:05,880
A knot twisted in my stomach, but I dared
not think the worst.

2400
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:10,700
Six days later the doctor saw her and began
a series of tests.

2401
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:20,830
I did not understand them then and I do not
understand them now, but I suppose it is because

2402
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:22,110
I am afraid to know.

2403
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:24,729
She spent almost an hour with Dr. Barnwell.

2404
02:27:24,729 --> 02:27:30,310
Finally, he called us both into his office
and sat us down.

2405
02:27:30,310 --> 02:27:41,350
She held my arm confidently, but I remember
clearly that my own hands were shaking.

2406
02:27:41,350 --> 02:27:49,900
"I'm so sorry to have to tell you this," Dr.
Barnwell began, "but you seem to be in the

2407
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:51,710
early stages of Alzheimer's..."

2408
02:27:51,710 --> 02:27:56,670
The words echoed in my head: the early stages
of Alzheimer's...

2409
02:27:56,670 --> 02:28:03,190
My world spun in circles, and I felt her grip
tighten on my arm.

2410
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:06,140
She whispered, almost to herself, "Oh, Noah...

2411
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:07,140
Noah..."

2412
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:08,890
And tears started to fall.

2413
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:15,090
It is a dreadful disease, as empty and lifeless
as a desert.

2414
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:18,390
It is a thief of souls and memories.

2415
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:33,450
I did not know what to say to her as she cried,
so I simply held her and rocked her back and

2416
02:28:33,450 --> 02:28:34,450
forth.

2417
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:36,750
I remember only bits and pieces of Dr. Barnwell's
continuing explanation.

2418
02:28:36,750 --> 02:28:38,939
"It's a degenerative brain disorder affecting
memory and personality...

2419
02:28:38,939 --> 02:28:40,250
there is no cure or therapy...

2420
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:45,790
there's no way to tell how fast it will progress...
it differs from person to person...

2421
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:47,790
I wish I knew more...

2422
02:28:47,790 --> 02:28:50,590
Some days will be better than others...

2423
02:28:50,590 --> 02:28:57,410
It will grow worse with the passage of time...

2424
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:59,130
I'm sorry..."

2425
02:28:59,130 --> 02:29:01,840
It has been four years now.

2426
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:08,160
Since then we have made the best of it, if
that is possible.

2427
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:13,439
Allie made arrangements to leave the house
and move here.

2428
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:16,060
She rewrote her will and sealed it.

2429
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:23,310
She left specific burial instructions, and
they are in my desk.

2430
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:24,770
I have not seen them.

2431
02:29:24,770 --> 02:29:29,540
And when she was finished, she began to write.

2432
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:32,180
Letters to friends and children.

2433
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:35,200
Letters to brothers and sisters and cousins.

2434
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,470
Letters to nieces, nephews and neighbours.

2435
02:29:37,470 --> 02:29:38,470
And a letter to me.

2436
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:44,859
I read it sometimes when I am in the mood
and, when I do, I remember Allie on cold winter

2437
02:29:44,859 --> 02:29:51,200
evenings, sitting by a fireplace with a glass
of wine at her side, reading the letters I

2438
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,810
had written to her over the years.

2439
02:29:53,810 --> 02:30:00,460
She kept them, these letters, and now I keep
them, for she made me promise to do so.

2440
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:05,420
She said I would know what to do with them.

2441
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:12,300
She was right; I find I enjoy reading them
from time to time.

2442
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:21,380
I see Allie now and know I've never loved
her more, but as I read the letters, I come

2443
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:26,960
to understand that I have always felt the
same way.

2444
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:33,410
I read them last three evenings ago.

2445
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:41,860
It was almost two o'clock when I went to the
desk and took out the stack of letters.

2446
02:30:41,860 --> 02:30:45,851
I untied the string and found the letters
her mother had hidden so long ago and those

2447
02:30:45,851 --> 02:30:46,851
from afterwards.

2448
02:30:46,851 --> 02:30:50,870
A lifetime of letters, letters expressing
my love, letters from my heart.

2449
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:56,800
I glanced through them with a smile on my
face, picking and choosing, and finally opened

2450
02:30:56,800 --> 02:31:00,220
a letter from a cold evening thirty-nine years
ago.

2451
02:31:00,220 --> 02:31:01,739
I read an extract:

2452
02:31:01,739 --> 02:31:06,670
Sitting next to you, while our youngest daughter
sang in the school Christmas show, I looked

2453
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:16,250
at you and saw a pride that comes only to
those who feel deeply in their hearts, and

2454
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:21,050
I knew that no man could be luckier than me.

2455
02:31:21,050 --> 02:31:26,100
And after our son died, the one who resembled
his mother...

2456
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:28,200
It was the hardest time we ever went through,
and the words still ring true today:

2457
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:35,650
In times of grief and sorrow, I will hold
you and rock you, and take your grief and

2458
02:31:35,650 --> 02:31:37,430
make it my own.

2459
02:31:37,430 --> 02:31:42,359
When you cry, I cry, and when you hurt, I
hurt.

2460
02:31:42,359 --> 02:31:51,470
And together we will try to hold back the
floods of tears and despair and make it through.

2461
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:53,330
I pause for just a moment, remembering him.

2462
02:31:53,330 --> 02:31:57,580
He was four years old at the time, just a
baby.

2463
02:31:57,580 --> 02:32:03,630
It is a terrible thing to outlive your child,
a tragedy I wish upon no one.

2464
02:32:03,630 --> 02:32:10,660
They went on, this correspondence of life
and love, and I read dozens more, some painful,

2465
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:11,859
most heart-warming.

2466
02:32:11,859 --> 02:32:19,460
By three o'clock, I was tired, but I had reached
the bottom of the stack.

2467
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:24,910
There was one letter remaining, the last one
I wrote to her.

2468
02:32:24,910 --> 02:32:30,910
I moved the first page into better light and
began to read:

2469
02:32:30,910 --> 02:32:32,410
My dearest Allie,

2470
02:32:32,410 --> 02:32:37,770
The porch is silent, and for once, I am at
a loss for words.

2471
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:49,200
It is a strange experience for me, for when
I think of you and the life we have shared,

2472
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:52,090
there is much to remember.

2473
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:54,399
A lifetime of memories.

2474
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:57,810
But to put it into words?

2475
02:32:57,810 --> 02:33:05,850
I am not a poet, and yet a poem is needed
to fully express the way I feel about you.

2476
02:33:05,850 --> 02:33:10,850
So my mind drifts and I remember thinking
about our life together as I made coffee this

2477
02:33:10,850 --> 02:33:11,850
morning.

2478
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:16,689
Kate was there, and so was Jane, and they
both became quiet when I walked into the kitchen.

2479
02:33:16,689 --> 02:33:26,010
I saw they'd been crying, and without a word
I sat myself beside them at the table and

2480
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:27,010
held, their hands.

2481
02:33:27,010 --> 02:33:32,790
And when I looked at them, I saw you from
so long-ago, the day we said goodbye.

2482
02:33:32,790 --> 02:33:41,080
They resemble you and how you were then, beautiful
and sensitive and wounded with the hurt that

2483
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:43,260
comes when something special is taken away.

2484
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:49,120
And for a reason I'm not sure I understand,
I was inspired to tell them a story.

2485
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:58,229
I called Jeff and David into the kitchen,
for they were here as well, and when the children

2486
02:33:58,229 --> 02:34:05,500
were ready I told them about us and how you
came back to me so long ago.

2487
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:11,939
I told them about our walk, and the crab dinner
in the kitchen, and they listened with smiles

2488
02:34:11,939 --> 02:34:17,680
when they heard about the canoe ride, and
sitting in front of the fire with the storm

2489
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:18,680
raging outside.

2490
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:24,811
I told them about your mother warning us about
Lon the next day - they seemed as surprised

2491
02:34:24,811 --> 02:34:32,850
as we were - and yes, I even told them what
happened later that day, after you went back

2492
02:34:32,850 --> 02:34:33,850
to town.

2493
02:34:33,850 --> 02:34:36,850
That part of the story has never left me,
even after all this time.

2494
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:43,750
Even though you described it to me only once,
I remember how impressed I was at the strength

2495
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:45,270
you showed that day.

2496
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:51,739
I still cannot imagine what was going through
your mind when you walked into the lobby and

2497
02:34:51,739 --> 02:34:52,739
saw Lon.

2498
02:34:52,739 --> 02:35:02,960
You told me that the two of you left the inn
and sat on a bench by the old Methodist church,

2499
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:07,250
and that he held your hand, even as you explained
that you must stay.

2500
02:35:07,250 --> 02:35:09,210
I know you cared for him.

2501
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:13,920
And his reaction proves to me he cared for
yur as well.

2502
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:20,649
Even as you explained that you had always
loved me, and that it wouldn't be fair to

2503
02:35:20,649 --> 02:35:23,069
him, he did not release your hand.

2504
02:35:23,069 --> 02:35:32,060
I know he was hurt and angry, and tried for
almost an hour to change your mind, but when

2505
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:41,271
you stood firm and said, "I can't go back
with you, I'm so sorry," he knew that you

2506
02:35:41,271 --> 02:35:43,181
had made your decision.

2507
02:35:43,181 --> 02:35:51,160
You said he simply nodded and the two of you
sat together for a long time without speaking.

2508
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:57,700
I have always wondered what he was thinking
as he sat with you, but I'm sure it was the

2509
02:35:57,700 --> 02:36:04,470
same way I felt only a few hours before.

2510
02:36:04,470 --> 02:36:14,800
And when he finally walked you to your car,
you said he told you that I was a lucky man.

2511
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:23,600
He behaved as a gentleman would, and I understood
then why your choice was so hard.

2512
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,180
I remember that when I finished the story,
the room was quiet until Kate finally stood

2513
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:29,180
to embrace me.

2514
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:34,760
"Oh, Daddy," she said with tears in her eyes,
and though I expected to answer their questions,

2515
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:36,750
they did not ask any.

2516
02:36:36,750 --> 02:36:39,940
Instead, they gave me something much more
special.

2517
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:47,580
For the next four hours, each of them told
me how much the two of us had meant to them

2518
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:48,580
while they were growing up.

2519
02:36:48,580 --> 02:36:51,330
One by one, they told stories about things
I had long since forgotten.

2520
02:36:51,330 --> 02:37:01,060
And by the end I was crying, because I realized
how well we had done with raising them.

2521
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:09,880
I was so proud of them, and proud of you,
and happy about the life we have led.

2522
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:13,260
And nothing will ever take that away.

2523
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:14,260
Nothing.

2524
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:19,560
I only regret that you were not here to enjoy
it with me.

2525
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:24,979
After they left, I rocked in silence, thinking
back on our life together.

2526
02:37:24,979 --> 02:37:32,810
You are always here with me when I do so,
at least in my heart, and it is impossible

2527
02:37:32,810 --> 02:37:41,109
for me to remember a time when you were not
a part of me.

2528
02:37:41,109 --> 02:37:43,479
I love you, Allie.

2529
02:37:43,479 --> 02:37:48,229
I am who I am because of you.

2530
02:37:48,229 --> 02:37:56,510
You are every reason, every hope and every
dream I've ever had, and no matter what happens

2531
02:37:56,510 --> 02:38:00,720
to us in the future, every day we are together
is the greatest day of my life.

2532
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:02,510
I will always be yours.

2533
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:05,370
And, my darling, you will always be mine.

2534
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:06,370
Noah

2535
02:38:06,370 --> 02:38:11,620
I put the pages aside and remember sitting
with Allie on our porch when she read this

2536
02:38:11,620 --> 02:38:13,610
letter for the first time.

2537
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:15,590
It was late afternoon.

2538
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:28,439
The sky was slowly changing colour, and as
I watched the sun go down, I thought about

2539
02:38:28,439 --> 02:38:38,380
that brief moment when day suddenly turns
into night.

2540
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:47,069
Dusk, I realized, is just an illusion, because
the sun is either above the horizon or below

2541
02:38:47,069 --> 02:38:48,069
it.

2542
02:38:48,069 --> 02:38:55,040
And that means that day and night are linked
in a way that few things are; there cannot

2543
02:38:55,040 --> 02:39:00,750
be one without the other, yet they cannot
exist at the same time.

2544
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:06,780
How would it feel, I wondered, to be always
together, yet forever apart?

2545
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:09,240
I know the answer now.

2546
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:16,620
I know what it's like to be day and night
now; always together, forever apart.

2547
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:21,820
THERE IS BEAUTY where we sit this afternoon,
Allie and I.

2548
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:28,310
The birds, the geese, float on the cool water,
which makes them seem larger than they really

2549
02:39:28,310 --> 02:39:29,310
are.

2550
02:39:29,310 --> 02:39:36,750
Allie too is watching them, and little by
little, we get to know each other again.

2551
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:40,319
"It's good to talk to you.

2552
02:39:40,319 --> 02:39:48,020
I find that I miss it, even when it hasn't
been that long."

2553
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:52,979
I am sincere and she knows this, but she is
still cautious.

2554
02:39:52,979 --> 02:39:59,439
I am a stranger.

2555
02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:10,330
"Is this something we do often?"

2556
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:11,330
she asks.

2557
02:40:11,330 --> 02:40:19,220
"Do we sit here and watch the birds a lot?

2558
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:25,569
I mean, do we know each other well?"

2559
02:40:25,569 --> 02:40:29,689
"Yes and no.

2560
02:40:29,689 --> 02:40:34,870
I think everyone has secrets, but we have
been acquainted for years."

2561
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:38,040
She looks to her hands, then mine.

2562
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:39,600
She thinks about this for a moment.

2563
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:43,590
We do not wear our rings.

2564
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:48,250
Again, there is a reason for this.

2565
02:40:48,250 --> 02:40:52,090
She asks, "Were you ever married?"

2566
02:40:52,090 --> 02:40:53,670
I nod.

2567
02:40:53,670 --> 02:40:54,670
"Yes."

2568
02:40:54,670 --> 02:40:57,620
"What was she like?"

2569
02:40:57,620 --> 02:40:59,069
I tell the truth.

2570
02:40:59,069 --> 02:41:01,479
"She was my dream.

2571
02:41:01,479 --> 02:41:12,390
She made me who I am, and holding her in my
arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat.

2572
02:41:12,390 --> 02:41:15,859
I think about her all the time.

2573
02:41:15,859 --> 02:41:20,810
Even now, when I'm sitting here, I think about
her."

2574
02:41:20,810 --> 02:41:22,790
She takes this in.

2575
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:27,680
I don't know how she feels about this.

2576
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:33,280
Finally, she speaks softly, her voice is angelic,
sensual.

2577
02:41:33,280 --> 02:41:37,790
I wonder if she knows I think these things.

2578
02:41:37,790 --> 02:41:38,819
"Is she dead?"

2579
02:41:38,819 --> 02:41:41,170
"My wife is alive in my heart.

2580
02:41:41,170 --> 02:41:43,870
And she always will be," I answer.

2581
02:41:43,870 --> 02:41:46,180
"You still love her, don't you?"

2582
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:47,180
"Of course.

2583
02:41:47,180 --> 02:41:48,880
But I love many things.

2584
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:52,540
I love to sit here with you.

2585
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:58,930
I love to share the beauty of this place with
someone I care about."

2586
02:41:58,930 --> 02:42:00,340
She is quiet for a moment.

2587
02:42:00,340 --> 02:42:04,560
She looks away so I can't see her face.

2588
02:42:04,560 --> 02:42:07,819
It has been her habit for years.

2589
02:42:07,819 --> 02:42:10,149
"Why are you doing this?"

2590
02:42:10,149 --> 02:42:12,020
No fear, just curiosity.

2591
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:13,410
This is good.

2592
02:42:13,410 --> 02:42:17,260
I know what she means, but I ask anyway.

2593
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:18,260
"What?"

2594
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:21,029
"Why are you spending the day with me?"

2595
02:42:21,029 --> 02:42:22,029
I smile.

2596
02:42:22,029 --> 02:42:27,560
"I'm here because this is where I'm supposed
to be.

2597
02:42:27,560 --> 02:42:31,870
It's not complicated.

2598
02:42:31,870 --> 02:42:35,710
Both you and I are enjoying ourselves.

2599
02:42:35,710 --> 02:42:38,050
My time with you is not wasted.

2600
02:42:38,050 --> 02:42:39,490
It's what I want.

2601
02:42:39,490 --> 02:42:46,700
I sit here and we talk and I think to myself,
'What could be better than what I am doing

2602
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:47,700
now?"'

2603
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:52,890
She looks in my eyes, and for a moment, just
a moment, her eyes twinkle.

2604
02:42:52,890 --> 02:42:55,319
A slight smile forms on her lips.

2605
02:42:55,319 --> 02:42:58,979
"I admit I enjoy your company, but I know
nothing about you.

2606
02:42:58,979 --> 02:43:04,000
I don't expect you to tell me your life story,
but why are you so mysterious?"

2607
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,830
"I read once that women love mysterious strangers."

2608
02:43:06,830 --> 02:43:09,010
"See, you haven't really answered the question.

2609
02:43:09,010 --> 02:43:11,550
You haven't answered most of my questions.

2610
02:43:11,550 --> 02:43:15,770
You didn't even tell me how the story ended
this morning."

2611
02:43:15,770 --> 02:43:16,770
I shrug.

2612
02:43:16,770 --> 02:43:19,189
We sit quietly for a while.

2613
02:43:19,189 --> 02:43:23,189
Finally, I ask, "Is it true that women love
mysterious strangers?"

2614
02:43:23,189 --> 02:43:25,260
She thinks about this and laughs.

2615
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:29,510
Then she answers as I would, "I think some
women do."

2616
02:43:29,510 --> 02:43:30,510
"Do you?"

2617
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:33,380
"Now don't go putting me on the spot.

2618
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:36,960
I don't know you well enough for that."

2619
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:39,220
She is teasing me and I enjoy it.

2620
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:41,710
We sit and watch the world around us.

2621
02:43:41,710 --> 02:43:44,140
This has taken us a lifetime to learn.

2622
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:52,090
It seems only the old are able to sit next
to one another and not say anything and still

2623
02:43:52,090 --> 02:43:53,120
feel happy.

2624
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:57,239
The young, impatient, must always break the
silence.

2625
02:43:57,239 --> 02:44:00,060
It is a waste, for silence is pure.

2626
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:01,090
Silence is holy.

2627
02:44:01,090 --> 02:44:05,520
It draws people together because only those
who are comfortable with each other can sit

2628
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:06,520
without speaking.

2629
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:07,910
This is the great paradox.

2630
02:44:07,910 --> 02:44:11,590
Time passes, and gradually our breathing begins
to coincide.

2631
02:44:11,590 --> 02:44:20,030
Deep breaths, relaxed breaths, and there is
a moment when she dozes off, like those comfortable

2632
02:44:20,030 --> 02:44:23,120
with one another often do.

2633
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:29,310
When she wakes, a miracle: "Do you see that
bird?"

2634
02:44:29,310 --> 02:44:33,199
She points to it, and I can see it because
the sun is bright.

2635
02:44:33,199 --> 02:44:40,070
"Caspian stem," I say softly, and we devote
our attention to it as it flies over the river.

2636
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:47,320
And, like an old habit rediscovered, when
I lower my arm, I put my hand on her knee

2637
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:49,220
and she doesn't make me move it.

2638
02:44:49,220 --> 02:44:51,029
SHE IS RIGHT about my evasiveness.

2639
02:44:51,029 --> 02:44:54,069
On days like these, when only her memory is
gone, I am vague in my answers because I've

2640
02:44:54,069 --> 02:44:57,021
hurt my wife unintentionally with careless
slips of my tongue many times these past few

2641
02:44:57,021 --> 02:45:00,489
years, and I am determined not to let it happen
again.

2642
02:45:00,489 --> 02:45:05,990
So I limit myself and answer only what is
asked, to limit the pain.

2643
02:45:05,990 --> 02:45:10,950
There are days she never learns of her children
or that we are married.

2644
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:14,990
I am sorry for this, but I will not change.

2645
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:17,120
Does this make me dishonest?

2646
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:25,479
Perhaps, but I have seen her crushed by the
waterfall of information that is her life.

2647
02:45:25,479 --> 02:45:33,130
Could I look myself in the mirror without
red eyes and trembling jaw and know I have

2648
02:45:33,130 --> 02:45:35,180
forgotten all that was important to me?

2649
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:43,340
I could not and neither can she, for when
this odyssey began, that is how I began.

2650
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:46,290
Her life, her marriage, her children.

2651
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:47,780
Her friends and her work.

2652
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:49,340
The days were hard on both of us.

2653
02:45:49,340 --> 02:45:55,880
I was an encyclopedia, an object without feeling,
of the who's, what's and where's in her life,

2654
02:45:55,880 --> 02:46:02,979
when in reality it is the whys, the things
I did not know and could not answer, that

2655
02:46:02,979 --> 02:46:04,819
make it all worthwhile.

2656
02:46:04,819 --> 02:46:10,790
She stared at pictures of forgotten children,
held paintbrushes that inspired nothing, and

2657
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:14,460
read love letters that brought back no joy.

2658
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:21,250
She became weaker over the hours, grew paler,
and ended the day worse than when it began.

2659
02:46:21,250 --> 02:46:24,640
Our days were lost and so was she.

2660
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:26,330
So I changed.

2661
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:30,641
I learned what is obvious to a child.

2662
02:46:30,641 --> 02:46:37,460
That life is simply a collection of little
lives, each lived one day at a time.

2663
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:43,470
That each day should be spent finding beauty
in flowers and poetry and talking to animals.

2664
02:46:43,470 --> 02:46:47,060
That a day spent with dreaming and sunsets
and refreshing breezes cannot be better.

2665
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:57,340
But most of all, I learned that life is for
sitting on benches next to rivers with my

2666
02:46:57,340 --> 02:47:04,439
hand on her knee and sometimes, on good days,
for falling in love.

2667
02:47:04,439 --> 02:47:05,540
"WHAT ARE you thinking?"

2668
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:06,540
she asks.

2669
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:07,540
It is now dusk.

2670
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:09,649
We have left our bench and are walking slowly.

2671
02:47:09,649 --> 02:47:13,561
She is holding my arm and I am her escort.

2672
02:47:13,561 --> 02:47:16,250
It is her idea to do this.

2673
02:47:16,250 --> 02:47:18,819
Perhaps she is charmed by me.

2674
02:47:18,819 --> 02:47:22,250
Perhaps she wants to keep me from falling.

2675
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:25,250
Either way, I am smiling to myself.

2676
02:47:25,250 --> 02:47:26,970
"I'm thinking about you."

2677
02:47:26,970 --> 02:47:37,530
She makes no response to this except to squeeze
my arm, and I can tell she likes what I said.

2678
02:47:37,530 --> 02:47:46,880
I go on, "I know you can't remember who you
are, but I can, and I find that when I look

2679
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:50,000
at you it makes me feel good."

2680
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,670
She taps my arm and smiles.

2681
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:55,910
"You're a kind man with a loving heart.

2682
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:59,750
I hope I enjoyed you as much before as I do
now."

2683
02:47:59,750 --> 02:48:04,960
I think about this as we walk in silence,
holding each other, past the rooms, past the

2684
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:06,070
courtyard.

2685
02:48:06,070 --> 02:48:12,399
We come to the garden, mainly with wild flowers,
and I stop her.

2686
02:48:12,399 --> 02:48:15,520
I pick some flowers - red, pink, yellow, violet.

2687
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:19,750
I give them to her, and she brings them to
her nose.

2688
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:25,569
She smells them with eyes closed and she whispers,
"They're beautiful."

2689
02:48:25,569 --> 02:48:31,229
We continue our walk, me in one hand, the
flowers in another.

2690
02:48:31,229 --> 02:48:36,830
People watch us, for we are a walking miracle,
or so I am told.

2691
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:38,439
It is true in a way.

2692
02:48:38,439 --> 02:48:42,630
By the time we reach the doorway, I am tired.

2693
02:48:42,630 --> 02:48:48,810
She knows this, so she stops me with her hand
and makes me face her.

2694
02:48:48,810 --> 02:48:53,290
She turns to me and stares for a long time.

2695
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:55,090
"What are you doing?"

2696
02:48:55,090 --> 02:48:56,090
I ask.

2697
02:48:56,090 --> 02:49:01,790
"I don't want to forget you or this day, and
I'm trying to keep your memory alive."

2698
02:49:01,790 --> 02:49:08,770
I wonder for a moment if it will work this
time, then I know it will not.

2699
02:49:08,770 --> 02:49:09,770
It can't.

2700
02:49:09,770 --> 02:49:11,960
I do not tell her my thoughts, though.

2701
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:14,640
I smile instead because her words are sweet.

2702
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,979
"Thank you," I say.

2703
02:49:15,979 --> 02:49:16,979
"I mean it.

2704
02:49:16,979 --> 02:49:20,260
I don't want to forget you again.

2705
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:22,670
You're very special to me."

2706
02:49:22,670 --> 02:49:25,090
My throat closes a little.

2707
02:49:25,090 --> 02:49:31,489
There is emotion behind her words, the emotions
I feel whenever I think of her.

2708
02:49:31,489 --> 02:49:37,939
I know this is why I live, and I love her
dearly at this moment.

2709
02:49:37,939 --> 02:49:45,120
How I wish I were strong enough to carry her
in my arms to paradise.

2710
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:49,750
"Don't try to say anything," she tells me.

2711
02:49:49,750 --> 02:49:52,649
"Let's just feel the moment."

2712
02:49:52,649 --> 02:49:55,550
And I do, and I feel heaven.

2713
02:49:55,550 --> 02:50:02,029
HER DISEASE is worse now than it was in the
beginning, though Allie is different from

2714
02:50:02,029 --> 02:50:03,029
most.

2715
02:50:03,029 --> 02:50:07,680
There are three others with the disease here,
and they are the sum of my practical experience

2716
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:08,680
of it.

2717
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:13,050
They, unlike Allie, are in the most advanced
stages of Alzheimer's and are almost completely

2718
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:14,050
lost.

2719
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:15,050
They wake up hallucinating and confused.

2720
02:50:15,050 --> 02:50:17,600
They seldom recognize the people who love
them.

2721
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:23,290
It is a trying disease, and this is why it
is hard for their children and mine to visit.

2722
02:50:23,290 --> 02:50:25,060
Allie, of course, has her own problems.

2723
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:29,399
She is terribly afraid in the mornings and
cries inconsolably.

2724
02:50:29,399 --> 02:50:42,600
She sees tiny people, like gnomes, I think,
watching her, and she screams at them to get

2725
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:43,600
away.

2726
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:49,100
She bathes willingly but doesn't want to eat
regularly.

2727
02:50:49,100 --> 02:50:57,399
She is thin now, much too thin in my opinion,
and on good days, I do my best to fatten her

2728
02:50:57,399 --> 02:50:58,399
up.

2729
02:50:58,399 --> 02:51:00,199
But this is where the similarity ends.

2730
02:51:00,199 --> 02:51:05,050
This is why Allie is considered a miracle,
because sometimes, just sometimes, after I

2731
02:51:05,050 --> 02:51:07,830
read to her, her condition isn't so bad.

2732
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:09,910
There is no explanation for this.

2733
02:51:09,910 --> 02:51:13,029
"It's impossible," the doctors say, "she cannot
have Alzheimer's."

2734
02:51:13,029 --> 02:51:14,060
But she does.

2735
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:17,880
On most days and every morning, there can
be no doubt.

2736
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:20,300
But why, then, is her condition different?

2737
02:51:20,300 --> 02:51:23,080
Why does she sometimes change after I read?

2738
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:29,069
I tell the doctors the reason - I know it
in my heart, but they don't believe me.

2739
02:51:29,069 --> 02:51:33,640
Four times specialists have travelled from
Chapel Hill to find the answer.

2740
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:36,870
Four times, they have left without understanding.

2741
02:51:36,870 --> 02:51:42,170
I tell them, "You can't possibly understand
it if you use only your science training and

2742
02:51:42,170 --> 02:51:46,290
your books," but they shake their heads and
answer, "Alzheimer's does not work like this.

2743
02:51:46,290 --> 02:51:49,989
With her condition, it's just not possible
to have a conversation or improve as the day

2744
02:51:49,989 --> 02:51:50,989
goes on.

2745
02:51:50,989 --> 02:51:51,989
Ever."

2746
02:51:51,989 --> 02:51:52,989
But she does.

2747
02:51:52,989 --> 02:51:59,300
Not every day, not most of the time, and definitely
less than she used to.

2748
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:00,340
But sometimes.

2749
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:03,580
And all that is gone on these days is her
memory, as if she has amnesia.

2750
02:52:03,580 --> 02:52:05,040
Her emotions are normal, her thoughts are
normal.

2751
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:08,910
And these are the days that I know I am doing
right.

2752
02:52:08,910 --> 02:52:12,500
DINNER IS WAITING in her room when we return.

2753
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:21,439
It has been arranged for us to eat here, as
it always is on days like these, and once

2754
02:52:21,439 --> 02:52:23,720
again, I could ask for no more.

2755
02:52:23,720 --> 02:52:26,819
The people here are good to me and I am thankful.

2756
02:52:26,819 --> 02:52:34,391
The room is lit by two candles on the table
where we will sit, and music is playing softly

2757
02:52:34,391 --> 02:52:35,850
in the background.

2758
02:52:35,850 --> 02:52:43,470
The cups and plates are plastic and the jug
is filled with apple juice, but rules are

2759
02:52:43,470 --> 02:52:45,910
rules and she doesn't care.

2760
02:52:45,910 --> 02:52:48,271
She inhales slightly at the sight.

2761
02:52:48,271 --> 02:52:49,840
Her eyes are wide.

2762
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:51,410
"Did you do this?"

2763
02:52:51,410 --> 02:52:54,550
I nod and she walks into the room.

2764
02:52:54,550 --> 02:52:55,720
"It looks beautiful."

2765
02:52:55,720 --> 02:53:01,229
I offer my arm in escort and lead her to the
window.

2766
02:53:01,229 --> 02:53:05,479
She doesn't release it when we get there.

2767
02:53:05,479 --> 02:53:11,390
Her touch is nice, and we stand close together
on this crystal springtime evening.

2768
02:53:11,390 --> 02:53:14,290
The window is open slightly and I feel a breeze.

2769
02:53:14,290 --> 02:53:19,140
The moon has risen and we watch for a long
time as the evening sky unfolds.

2770
02:53:19,140 --> 02:53:23,640
"I've never seen anything so beautiful, I'm
sure of it," she says.

2771
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:27,770
"I haven't, either," I say, but I am looking
at her.

2772
02:53:27,770 --> 02:53:31,720
She knows what I mean and I see her smile.

2773
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:39,109
A moment later she whispers, "I think I know
who Allie went with at the end of the story."

2774
02:53:39,109 --> 02:53:40,109
"Who?"

2775
02:53:40,109 --> 02:53:41,109
"She went with Noah."

2776
02:53:41,109 --> 02:53:42,109
"You're sure?"

2777
02:53:42,109 --> 02:53:43,109
"Absolutely."

2778
02:53:43,109 --> 02:53:44,109
I smile and nod.

2779
02:53:44,109 --> 02:53:48,100
"Yes, she did," I say softly, and she smiles
back; her face is radiant.

2780
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:50,649
She sits and I sit opposite her.

2781
02:53:50,649 --> 02:53:57,220
She offers her hand across the table and I
take it in mine, and I feel her thumb begin

2782
02:53:57,220 --> 02:53:59,890
to move as it did so many years ago.

2783
02:53:59,890 --> 02:54:08,200
I stare at her for a long time, living and
reliving the moments of my life, remembering

2784
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:10,910
it all and making it real.

2785
02:54:10,910 --> 02:54:18,580
I feel my throat begin to tighten and once
again, I realize how much I love her.

2786
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:22,189
My voice is shaky when I finally speak.

2787
02:54:22,189 --> 02:54:24,439
"You're so beautiful," I say.

2788
02:54:24,439 --> 02:54:30,370
I can see in her eyes that she knows how I
feel about her and what I really mean by my

2789
02:54:30,370 --> 02:54:31,370
words.

2790
02:54:31,370 --> 02:54:32,370
She does not respond.

2791
02:54:32,370 --> 02:54:35,189
Instead, she lowers her eyes and I wonder
what she's thinking.

2792
02:54:35,189 --> 02:54:36,319
I gently squeeze her hand.

2793
02:54:36,319 --> 02:54:37,319
I wait.

2794
02:54:37,319 --> 02:54:40,090
I know her heart and I know I'm almost there.

2795
02:54:40,090 --> 02:54:41,729
And then a miracle that proves me right.

2796
02:54:41,729 --> 02:54:46,939
As Glenn Miller plays softly in the room,
I watch as she gradually gives in to the feelings

2797
02:54:46,939 --> 02:54:47,939
inside her.

2798
02:54:47,939 --> 02:54:51,620
I see a warm smile begin to form on her lips,
the kind that makes it all worthwhile, and

2799
02:54:51,620 --> 02:54:52,620
I watch as she raises her hazy eyes to mine.

2800
02:54:52,620 --> 02:54:53,890
She pulls my hand towards her.

2801
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:54,890
"You're wonderful..."

2802
02:54:54,890 --> 02:54:58,811
she says softly, and at that moment she falls
in love with me, too; this I know, for I have

2803
02:54:58,811 --> 02:55:02,900
seen the signs a thousand times.

2804
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:08,250
She says nothing else, she doesn't have to,
and she gives me a look from another lifetime

2805
02:55:08,250 --> 02:55:09,850
that makes me whole again.

2806
02:55:09,850 --> 02:55:15,370
I smile back, and we stare at each other with
the feelings inside us rolling like ocean

2807
02:55:15,370 --> 02:55:16,370
waves.

2808
02:55:16,370 --> 02:55:23,439
I look about the room, then back at Allie,
and the way she's looking at me makes me warm.

2809
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:24,949
And suddenly I feel young again.

2810
02:55:24,949 --> 02:55:27,960
I'm no longer cold or aching, or almost blind
with cataracts.

2811
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:31,100
I'm strong and proud and the luckiest man
alive.

2812
02:55:31,100 --> 02:55:37,370
By the time the candles have burned down a
third, I am ready to break the silence.

2813
02:55:37,370 --> 02:55:41,630
I say, "I love you deeply and I hope you know
that."

2814
02:55:41,630 --> 02:55:44,439
"Of course I do," she says.

2815
02:55:44,439 --> 02:55:45,590
"I've always loved you, Noah."

2816
02:55:45,590 --> 02:55:46,590
Noah, I hear again.

2817
02:55:46,590 --> 02:55:48,689
The word echoes in my head.

2818
02:55:48,689 --> 02:55:49,689
Noah...

2819
02:55:49,689 --> 02:55:50,689
Noah.

2820
02:55:50,689 --> 02:55:52,410
She knows, I think to myself, she knows who
I am...

2821
02:55:52,410 --> 02:55:53,410
She knows...

2822
02:55:53,410 --> 02:56:00,720
Such a tiny thing, this knowledge, but for
me it is a gift from God, and I feel our lifetime

2823
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:08,740
together, holding her, loving her, and being
with her through the best years of my life.

2824
02:56:08,740 --> 02:56:13,979
She murmurs, "Noah... my sweet Noah..."

2825
02:56:13,979 --> 02:56:21,300
And I, who could not accept the doctors' words,
have won again, at least for a moment.

2826
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:28,569
I give up the pretence of mystery, and I kiss
her hand and bring it to my cheek and whisper

2827
02:56:28,569 --> 02:56:34,449
in her ear, "You are the greatest thing that
has ever happened to me."

2828
02:56:34,449 --> 02:56:35,449
"Oh...

2829
02:56:35,449 --> 02:56:39,899
Noah," she says with tears in her eyes, "I
love you, too."

2830
02:56:39,899 --> 02:56:44,380
IF ONLY IT would end like this, I would be
a happy man.

2831
02:56:44,380 --> 02:56:45,380
But it won't.

2832
02:56:45,380 --> 02:56:52,560
Of this, I'm sure, for soon I begin to see
the signs of worry in her face.

2833
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:53,560
"What's wrong?"

2834
02:56:53,560 --> 02:56:55,529
I ask, and her answer comes softly.

2835
02:56:55,529 --> 02:56:56,529
"I'm so afraid.

2836
02:56:56,529 --> 02:56:58,540
I'm afraid of forgetting you again.

2837
02:56:58,540 --> 02:56:59,740
It isn't fair...

2838
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:01,493
I just can't bear to give this up."

2839
02:57:01,493 --> 02:57:12,811
Her voice breaks as she finishes, but I don't
know what to say.

2840
02:57:12,811 --> 02:57:19,649
I know the evening is coming to an end and
there is nothing I can do to stop the inevitable.

2841
02:57:19,649 --> 02:57:21,939
In this, I am a failure.

2842
02:57:21,939 --> 02:57:24,989
I finally tell her, "I'll never leave you.

2843
02:57:24,989 --> 02:57:26,899
What we have is forever."

2844
02:57:26,899 --> 02:57:32,670
She knows this is all I can do, for neither
of us wants empty promises.

2845
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:38,270
After dinner, I become afraid for I know the
bell has tolled this evening.

2846
02:57:38,270 --> 02:57:43,330
The sun has long since set and the thief is
about to come, and there is nothing I can

2847
02:57:43,330 --> 02:57:44,930
do to stop it.

2848
02:57:44,930 --> 02:57:51,210
So I stare at her and wait and live a lifetime
in these last remaining moments.

2849
02:57:51,210 --> 02:57:52,210
The clock ticks.

2850
02:57:52,210 --> 02:57:53,210
Nothing.

2851
02:57:53,210 --> 02:57:57,000
I take her in my arms and we hold each other.

2852
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Nothing.

2853
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:03,210
I feel her tremble and I whisper in her ear.

2854
02:58:03,210 --> 02:58:04,210
Nothing.

2855
02:58:04,210 --> 02:58:09,930
I tell her for the last time this evening
that I love her.

2856
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:11,561
And the thief comes.

2857
02:58:11,561 --> 02:58:13,050
It always amazes me how quickly it happens.

2858
02:58:13,050 --> 02:58:14,170
Even now, after all this time.

2859
02:58:14,170 --> 02:58:20,930
For as she holds me, she begins to blink rapidly
and shake her head.

2860
02:58:20,930 --> 02:58:26,150
Then, turning towards the comer of the room,
she stares for a long time, worried.

2861
02:58:26,150 --> 02:58:27,150
No!

2862
02:58:27,150 --> 02:58:28,150
My mind screams.

2863
02:58:28,150 --> 02:58:29,150
Not yet!

2864
02:58:29,150 --> 02:58:30,830
Not now... not when we're so close!

2865
02:58:30,830 --> 02:58:31,830
Not tonight!

2866
02:58:31,830 --> 02:58:32,830
Please!

2867
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:33,830
I can't take it again!

2868
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:34,830
It isn't fair...

2869
02:58:34,830 --> 02:58:35,979
It isn't fair...

2870
02:58:35,979 --> 02:58:39,489
But once again, it is useless.

2871
02:58:39,489 --> 02:58:42,351
"Those people," she finally says, pointing,
"are staring at me.

2872
02:58:42,351 --> 02:58:43,351
Please make them stop."

2873
02:58:43,351 --> 02:58:44,351
The gnomes.

2874
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,351
My mouth goes dry.

2875
02:58:45,351 --> 02:58:46,910
It is over, I know.

2876
02:58:46,910 --> 02:58:52,270
This, the evening confusion that affects my
wife, is the hardest part of all.

2877
02:58:52,270 --> 02:58:59,609
For when it comes, she is gone, and sometimes
I wonder whether she and I will ever love

2878
02:58:59,609 --> 02:59:00,609
again.

2879
02:59:00,609 --> 02:59:04,360
"There's no one there, Allie," I say, trying
to stop the inevitable.

2880
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:06,810
She doesn't believe me.

2881
02:59:06,810 --> 02:59:09,260
"They're staring at me.

2882
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:11,710
You can't see them?"

2883
02:59:11,710 --> 02:59:16,640
"No," I say, and she thinks for a moment.

2884
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:21,100
"Well, they're right there," she says, "and
they're staring at me."

2885
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:27,990
With that, she begins to talk to herself,
and moments later, when I try to comfort her,

2886
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:29,910
she steps back with wide eyes.

2887
02:59:29,910 --> 02:59:30,910
"Who are you?"

2888
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:34,630
she cries in panic, her face is becoming whiter.

2889
02:59:34,630 --> 02:59:37,660
"What are you doing here?"

2890
02:59:37,660 --> 02:59:46,590
She backs away from me, her hands are in a
defensive position, and then she says the

2891
02:59:46,590 --> 02:59:49,359
most heartbreaking words of all.

2892
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:50,479
"Go away!

2893
02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:52,710
Stay away from me!"

2894
02:59:52,710 --> 03:00:00,090
She is pushing the gnomes away from her, terrified,
not noticing my presence.

2895
03:00:00,090 --> 03:00:08,740
I stand and cross the room to her bed.

2896
03:00:08,740 --> 03:00:15,310
I am weak now, my legs ache, and there is
a strange pain in my side.

2897
03:00:15,310 --> 03:00:20,100
I press the button to call the nurses.

2898
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:27,530
They will be here soon now, I know, and I
wait for them.

2899
03:00:27,530 --> 03:00:35,550
I sit by the bed with an aching back and start
to cry.

2900
03:00:35,550 --> 03:00:42,110
I am tired now, so I sit, alone and apart
from my wife.

2901
03:00:42,110 --> 03:00:45,399
And when the nurses come in they see two people
they must comfort.

2902
03:00:45,399 --> 03:00:56,120
A woman shaking in fear and the old man who
loves her more deeply than life itself, crying

2903
03:00:56,120 --> 03:01:02,640
softly in the comer, with his face in his
hands.

2904
03:01:02,640 --> 03:01:15,550
ON A COOL, foggy morning eight days after
she and I had spent our day together, I woke

2905
03:01:15,550 --> 03:01:24,100
early, as is my custom, and read letters written
many years before.

2906
03:01:24,100 --> 03:01:26,449
At least I tried to.

2907
03:01:26,449 --> 03:01:40,670
I couldn't concentrate too well because I
had a headache, so I put them aside and went

2908
03:01:40,670 --> 03:01:48,500
to sit in my chair by the window to watch
the sun come up.

2909
03:01:48,500 --> 03:02:01,600
It happened as I sat in the chair, just as
the sun peeped over the horizon.

2910
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:15,080
My hand, I noticed, started to tingle, something
it had never done before.

2911
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:18,250
I started to lift it, but I was forced to
stop when I felt a terrible headache.

2912
03:02:18,250 --> 03:02:20,359
I closed my eyes tightly.

2913
03:02:20,359 --> 03:02:23,870
My hand stopped tingling and began to go numb.

2914
03:02:23,870 --> 03:02:32,190
A shooting pain flew down my neck and into
every cell of my body, like a wave, crushing

2915
03:02:32,190 --> 03:02:33,190
and wasting everything in its path.

2916
03:02:33,190 --> 03:02:46,449
I lost my sight and I heard what sounded like
a train roaring, and I knew that I was having

2917
03:02:46,449 --> 03:02:49,660
a stroke.

2918
03:02:49,660 --> 03:02:59,880
The pain coursed through my body, and in my
last remaining moments of consciousness I

2919
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:07,400
pictured Allie, lying in her bed, waiting
for the story I would never read, lost and

2920
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:13,250
confused, completely and totally unable to
help herself.

2921
03:03:13,250 --> 03:03:20,430
I WAS UNCONSCIOUS on and off for days, and
in those moments when I was awake I found

2922
03:03:20,430 --> 03:03:25,499
myself fixed to machines; two bags of fluid
were hanging near the bed.

2923
03:03:25,499 --> 03:03:32,609
I drifted in and out of consciousness for
days until another foggy morning when my promise

2924
03:03:32,609 --> 03:03:35,930
to Allie stimulated my body once again.

2925
03:03:35,930 --> 03:03:44,300
I opened my eyes and saw a room full of flowers,
and their scent motivated me further.

2926
03:03:44,300 --> 03:03:52,090
I looked for the button, struggled to press
it, and a nurse arrived thirty seconds later,

2927
03:03:52,090 --> 03:03:54,710
followed closely by Dr. Barnwell.

2928
03:03:54,710 --> 03:03:58,689
"I'm thirsty," I said, and Dr. Barnwell smiled
broadly.

2929
03:03:58,689 --> 03:04:03,090
"Welcome back," he said, "I knew you'd make
it."

2930
03:04:03,090 --> 03:04:12,420
TWO WEEKS LATER I am able to leave the hospital,
though I am only half a man now.

2931
03:04:12,420 --> 03:04:19,770
The right side of my body is weaker than the
left.

2932
03:04:19,770 --> 03:04:24,380
I can't use either my cane or wheelchair,
so I must march now to my own unique rhythm

2933
03:04:24,380 --> 03:04:26,120
to keep upright.

2934
03:04:26,120 --> 03:04:34,100
Not left-right-left as in my youth, or even
the shuffle-shuffle of late, but rather slow-shuffle,

2935
03:04:34,100 --> 03:04:35,600
slide-the- right, slow-shuffle.

2936
03:04:35,600 --> 03:04:44,170
I am on a heroic adventure now when I travel
the halls.

2937
03:04:44,170 --> 03:04:50,660
When I return to my room, I know I will not
sleep.

2938
03:04:50,660 --> 03:04:54,680
I breathe deeply and smell the spring through
the open window.

2939
03:04:54,680 --> 03:05:00,580
Evelyn, one of the many nurses here, helps
me to the chair by the window.

2940
03:05:00,580 --> 03:05:04,239
She puts her hand on my shoulder and pats
it gently.

2941
03:05:04,239 --> 03:05:13,440
She says nothing, and by her silence, I know
that she is staring out of the window.

2942
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:18,439
Then she leans forward and tenderly kisses
me on the cheek.

2943
03:05:18,439 --> 03:05:20,979
"It's good to have you back.

2944
03:05:20,979 --> 03:05:25,220
Allie's missed you and so have the rest of
us.

2945
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:30,920
We were all praying for you because it's just
not the same around here when you're gone."

2946
03:05:30,920 --> 03:05:34,350
She smiles at me and touches my face before
she leaves.

2947
03:05:34,350 --> 03:05:35,350
I say nothing.

2948
03:05:35,350 --> 03:05:38,040
The stars are out tonight and the crickets
are singing.

2949
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:43,949
As I sit, I wonder if anyone outside can see
me, this prisoner of flesh.

2950
03:05:43,949 --> 03:05:45,680
I watch for hours.

2951
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:50,479
A storm is coming and in time, the sky will
turn silver.

2952
03:05:50,479 --> 03:05:55,450
Lightning cuts the wild sky and I feel my
mind drift back.

2953
03:05:55,450 --> 03:05:57,939
Who are we, Allie and I?

2954
03:05:57,939 --> 03:06:05,729
Are we ancient ivy on a tree, intertwined
so closely that we would both die if we were

2955
03:06:05,729 --> 03:06:06,729
forced apart?

2956
03:06:06,729 --> 03:06:13,860
On the desk, I see a picture of Allie, the
best one I have.

2957
03:06:13,860 --> 03:06:16,595
I reach for it and hold it inches from my
face.

2958
03:06:16,595 --> 03:06:25,320
She was forty-one when it was taken, and she
had never been more beautiful.

2959
03:06:25,320 --> 03:06:32,739
There are so many things I want to ask her,
but I know the picture won't answer, so I

2960
03:06:32,739 --> 03:06:34,040
put it aside.

2961
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:36,240
I finally stand and turn on the lamp.

2962
03:06:36,240 --> 03:06:43,689
This is a night of memories, so I look for
and find my wedding ring.

2963
03:06:43,689 --> 03:06:46,910
It is in the top drawer.

2964
03:06:46,910 --> 03:06:50,529
I cannot wear it anymore because my knuckles
are swollen.

2965
03:06:50,529 --> 03:06:53,580
The ring is powerful - a symbol, a circle.

2966
03:06:53,580 --> 03:06:58,529
I whisper aloud, "I am still yours, Allie,
my queen, my timeless beauty.

2967
03:06:58,529 --> 03:07:03,450
You are, and always have been, the best thing
in my life."

2968
03:07:03,450 --> 03:07:11,699
It is eleven thirty and I look for the letter
she wrote to me, the one I read when the mood

2969
03:07:11,699 --> 03:07:12,699
strikes me.

2970
03:07:12,699 --> 03:07:17,700
I find it where I last left it.

2971
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:20,260
I open it and my hands begin to tremble:

2972
03:07:20,260 --> 03:07:21,260
Dear Noah,

2973
03:07:21,260 --> 03:07:24,640
I write this letter by candlelight, as you
lie sleeping in the bedroom we have shared

2974
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:26,960
since the day we were married.

2975
03:07:26,960 --> 03:07:37,280
I see the flame beside me and 
it reminds me of another fire from decades

2976
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:45,840
ago, with me in your soft clothes, and I knew
then we would always be together.

2977
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:56,780
I remember how I came back to you the day
after my mother had left.

2978
03:07:56,780 --> 03:08:05,460
I was so scared because I was sure you would
never forgive me for leaving you.

2979
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:16,590
I was shaking as I got out of the car, but
you took it all away with your smile.

2980
03:08:16,590 --> 03:08:19,220
"How about some coffee?"

2981
03:08:19,220 --> 03:08:21,850
was all you said.

2982
03:08:21,850 --> 03:08:26,380
And you never spoke about it again in all
our years together.

2983
03:08:26,380 --> 03:08:33,920
You didn't ask questions when I left and walked
alone from time to time, during the next few

2984
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:34,920
days.

2985
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:45,110
When I came in with tears in my eyes, you
always knew whether I needed you to hold me

2986
03:08:45,110 --> 03:08:47,980
or to just let me be.

2987
03:08:47,980 --> 03:08:54,149
I don't know how but you did, and you made
it easier for me.

2988
03:08:54,149 --> 03:09:00,540
Later, when we went to the small chapel and
exchanged our rings, I looked into your eyes

2989
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:03,490
and knew I had made the right decision.

2990
03:09:03,490 --> 03:09:08,860
More than that, I knew I was foolish forever
considering someone else.

2991
03:09:08,860 --> 03:09:15,120
We had a wonderful life together, and I think
about it a lot now.

2992
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:21,630
I close my eyes sometimes and see you, sitting
on the porch and playing your guitar while

2993
03:09:21,630 --> 03:09:23,640
little ones clap to the music you create.

2994
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:26,659
"You're a better father than you know," I
tell you later, after the children are sleeping.

2995
03:09:26,659 --> 03:09:31,840
I love you for many things, especially your
passions: love, and poetry, and fatherhood,

2996
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:34,300
and friendship, and beauty, and nature.

2997
03:09:34,300 --> 03:09:41,660
And I am glad you have taught the children
these things, for I know their lives are better

2998
03:09:41,660 --> 03:09:42,660
for it.

2999
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:54,060
They tell me how special you are to them,
and it makes me feel like the luckiest woman

3000
03:09:54,060 --> 03:09:55,060
alive.

3001
03:09:55,060 --> 03:10:03,550
You have taught me as well, and inspired me
and supported me in my painting, and you will

3002
03:10:03,550 --> 03:10:14,550
never know how much it has meant to me that
you were always ready to comfort and encourage

3003
03:10:14,550 --> 03:10:17,090
me.

3004
03:10:17,090 --> 03:10:25,130
You understood my need for my own studio,
my own space, and saw beyond the paint on

3005
03:10:25,130 --> 03:10:26,930
my clothes and in my hair.

3006
03:10:26,930 --> 03:10:31,409
I know it was not easy to live with something
like that.

3007
03:10:31,409 --> 03:10:32,930
And you have.

3008
03:10:32,930 --> 03:10:34,960
For forty-five years now.

3009
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:35,979
Wonderful years.

3010
03:10:35,979 --> 03:10:44,990
You are my best friend as well as my lover,
and I do not know which side of you I enjoy

3011
03:10:44,990 --> 03:10:45,990
the most.

3012
03:10:45,990 --> 03:10:49,790
I treasure each side, just as I have treasured
our life together.

3013
03:10:49,790 --> 03:10:53,010
You have something inside you, Noah, something
beautiful and strong.

3014
03:10:53,010 --> 03:10:57,840
Kindness, that's what I see when I look at
you now, that's what everyone sees.

3015
03:10:57,840 --> 03:10:58,840
Kindness.

3016
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:03,970
I know you think me crazy for making us write
our story before we finally leave our home,

3017
03:11:03,970 --> 03:11:07,130
but I have my reasons and I thank you for
your patience.

3018
03:11:07,130 --> 03:11:11,960
I never told you why, but now I think it is
time for you to know.

3019
03:11:11,960 --> 03:11:17,010
We have lived a lifetime most couples never
know, and when I look at you I am frightened

3020
03:11:17,010 --> 03:11:19,470
by the knowledge that all this will be ending
soon.

3021
03:11:19,470 --> 03:11:21,250
For we both know my prognosis.

3022
03:11:21,250 --> 03:11:30,160
I worry more about you than I do about me,
because I fear the pain I know you will go

3023
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:31,160
through.

3024
03:11:31,160 --> 03:11:35,189
There are no words to express my sorrow for
this.

3025
03:11:35,189 --> 03:11:44,330
I love you so deeply, so much, that I will
find a way to come back to you despite my

3026
03:11:44,330 --> 03:11:46,620
disease, I promise you that.

3027
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:48,970
And this is where the story comes in.

3028
03:11:48,970 --> 03:11:55,140
When I am lost and lonely, read this story
- just as you told it to the children - and

3029
03:11:55,140 --> 03:12:01,279
know that in some way I will realize it's
about us.

3030
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:06,529
And perhaps, just perhaps, we will find a
way to be together again.

3031
03:12:06,529 --> 03:12:14,470
Please don't be angry with me on days I do
not remember you - we both know they will

3032
03:12:14,470 --> 03:12:15,470
come.

3033
03:12:15,470 --> 03:12:26,529
Know that I will always love you, and no matter
what happens, know that I have led the greatest

3034
03:12:26,529 --> 03:12:27,540
life possible.

3035
03:12:27,540 --> 03:12:29,010
My life with you.

3036
03:12:29,010 --> 03:12:33,790
Noah, wherever you are and whenever you read
this, I love you.

3037
03:12:33,790 --> 03:12:36,640
I love you deeply, my husband.

3038
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:41,029
You are, and always have been, my dream.

3039
03:12:41,029 --> 03:12:42,029
Allie

3040
03:12:42,029 --> 03:12:47,500
I put the letter aside, rise from my desk
and find my slippers.

3041
03:12:47,500 --> 03:12:50,300
I must sit to put them on.

3042
03:12:50,300 --> 03:12:54,290
Then, standing, I cross the room and open
my door.

3043
03:12:54,290 --> 03:13:04,570
I look down the hall and see Janice seated
at the main desk, which I must pass to get

3044
03:13:04,570 --> 03:13:05,890
to Allie's room.

3045
03:13:05,890 --> 03:13:12,620
At this hour, I am not supposed to leave my
room, and Janice does not break the rules.

3046
03:13:12,620 --> 03:13:19,380
I wait to see if she will leave, but she does
not and I grow impatient.

3047
03:13:19,380 --> 03:13:23,819
I finally exit my room anyway, slow-shuffle,
slide-the-right, slow-shuffle.

3048
03:13:23,819 --> 03:13:29,240
In the end, I am discovered, but I am not
surprised.

3049
03:13:29,240 --> 03:13:31,210
I stand before her.

3050
03:13:31,210 --> 03:13:35,739
"Noah," she says, "what are you doing?"

3051
03:13:35,739 --> 03:13:40,590
"I'm taking a walk," I say.

3052
03:13:40,590 --> 03:13:43,010
"I can't sleep."

3053
03:13:43,010 --> 03:14:03,489
"You're not really going for a walk, are you?

3054
03:14:03,489 --> 03:14:13,939
You're going to see Allie."

3055
03:14:13,939 --> 03:14:16,580
"Yes," I answer.

3056
03:14:16,580 --> 03:14:27,270
"Noah, you know what happened the last time
you saw her at night.

3057
03:14:27,270 --> 03:14:30,109
You shouldn't do this."

3058
03:14:30,109 --> 03:14:32,239
"I miss her."

3059
03:14:32,239 --> 03:14:40,040
"I know you do, but I can't let you see her."

3060
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:43,590
"It's our anniversary," I say.

3061
03:14:43,590 --> 03:14:45,720
This is true.

3062
03:14:45,720 --> 03:14:49,979
It is one year before gold.

3063
03:14:49,979 --> 03:14:52,720
Forty-nine years today.

3064
03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:56,040
"I see."

3065
03:14:56,040 --> 03:15:03,350
She looks away for a moment, and her voice
becomes softer.

3066
03:15:03,350 --> 03:15:06,460
I am surprised.

3067
03:15:06,460 --> 03:15:14,540
She has never struck me as the sentimental
type.

3068
03:15:14,540 --> 03:15:24,040
"Noah, I've seen hundreds of couples struggle
with grief, but I've never seen anyone handle

3069
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:26,569
it like you do.

3070
03:15:26,569 --> 03:15:32,569
No one around here has ever seen anything
like it."

3071
03:15:32,569 --> 03:15:43,229
She pauses for just a moment and her eyes
begin to fill with tears.

3072
03:15:43,229 --> 03:15:56,710
"I try to think what it's like for you, how
you keep going day after day, but I can't

3073
03:15:56,710 --> 03:15:58,229
imagine it.

3074
03:15:58,229 --> 03:16:00,250
I don't know how you do it.

3075
03:16:00,250 --> 03:16:02,489
You even beat her disease sometimes.

3076
03:16:02,489 --> 03:16:07,229
Even though the doctors don't understand it,
we nurses do.

3077
03:16:07,229 --> 03:16:10,170
It's love - it's as simple as that.

3078
03:16:10,170 --> 03:16:14,090
It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen."

3079
03:16:14,090 --> 03:16:19,479
A lump has risen in my throat, and I am speechless.

3080
03:16:19,479 --> 03:16:25,540
"But, Noah, you're not supposed to do this,
and I can't let you.

3081
03:16:25,540 --> 03:16:28,700
So go back to your room."

3082
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:33,529
Then, smiling, she says, "I'm going downstairs
for some coffee.

3083
03:16:33,529 --> 03:16:41,790
I won't be back to check on you for a while,
so don't do anything foolish."

3084
03:16:41,790 --> 03:16:50,280
She rises quickly, touches my arm and walks
towards the stairs.

3085
03:16:50,280 --> 03:17:00,409
She doesn't look back and suddenly I am alone.

3086
03:17:00,409 --> 03:17:17,320
I look at her desk and see her coffee, a full
cup, and once again, I learn that there are

3087
03:17:17,320 --> 03:17:20,771
good people in the world.

3088
03:17:20,771 --> 03:17:30,590
As I begin my way to Allie's room, I take
tiny steps, and even at that pace, my legs

3089
03:17:30,590 --> 03:17:31,620
grow tired.

3090
03:17:31,620 --> 03:17:40,479
I find I must touch the wall to keep from
falling down.

3091
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:46,720
When I finally reach her room, my body is
weak.

3092
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:54,170
My legs are trembling, and my eyes are blurred.

3093
03:17:54,170 --> 03:18:07,689
The door opens and light from the hallway
illuminates the bed where she sleeps.

3094
03:18:07,689 --> 03:18:13,970
She is lying with the covers halfway up.

3095
03:18:13,970 --> 03:18:20,430
After a moment, I see her roll to one side.

3096
03:18:20,430 --> 03:18:29,050
She looks small in her bed.

3097
03:18:29,050 --> 03:18:46,920
I think I hear someone coming, so I enter
her room and close the door behind me.

3098
03:18:46,920 --> 03:19:05,630
Blackness descends and 

3099
03:19:05,630 --> 03:19:22,130
I cross her floor from memory and reach the
window.

3100
03:19:22,130 --> 03:19:35,069
I open the curtains, and the moon stares back,
large and full.

3101
03:19:35,069 --> 03:19:45,970
Though I know I should not, I sit on her bed.

3102
03:19:45,970 --> 03:19:56,250
Then I reach across and gently touch her face.

3103
03:19:56,250 --> 03:20:14,529
I stroke her hair, and I feel wonder.

3104
03:20:14,529 --> 03:20:25,449
She moves and opens her eyes and I suddenly
regret my foolishness, for I know she will

3105
03:20:25,449 --> 03:20:43,069
begin to cry and scream, for this is what
she always does.

3106
03:20:43,069 --> 03:21:04,149
But I feel an urge to attempt the impossible
and lean towards her.

3107
03:21:04,149 --> 03:21:09,130
Her lips meet mine.

3108
03:21:09,130 --> 03:21:36,060
And suddenly a miracle, for I feel her mouth
open and I discover a forgotten paradise,

3109
03:21:36,060 --> 03:21:41,399
unchanged all this time, ageless like the
stars.

3110
03:21:41,399 --> 03:22:07,600
I feel the warmth of her body, I close my
eyes and become young again - a mighty ship,

3111
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:22,250
strong and fearless, and she is my sails.

3112
03:22:22,250 --> 03:22:38,960
I gently stroke her cheek, then take her hand
in mine.

3113
03:22:38,960 --> 03:23:41,510
I kiss her lips, her cheeks, and listen as
she takes a breath.

3114
03:23:41,510 --> 03:23:48,330
She murmurs softly, "Oh, Noah...

3115
03:23:48,330 --> 03:23:57,319
I've missed you."

3116
03:23:57,319 --> 03:24:26,020
Another miracle - the greatest of all! - and
there's no way I can stop the tears as we

3117
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:29,050
begin to slip towards heaven itself.

3118
03:24:29,050 --> 03:24:56,729
For 

3119
03:24:56,729 --> 03:25:39,120
at 
that moment, the world is full of wonder as

3120
03:25:39,120 --> 03:27:06,270
I feel her fingers reach for 

3121
03:27:06,270 --> 03:28:09,310
the buttons on my shirt and slowly, very slowly,
she begins to undo them 

3122
03:28:09,310 --> 03:35:38,739
one 

3123
03:35:38,739 --> 03:37:56,770
by one.

3124
03:37:56,770 --> 03:41:22,080
- THE 

3125
03:41:22,080 --> 03:41:22,561
END -
