CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:11,370
As long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing
to be born at home. At present, so I am told,

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,469
the high gods of medicine have decreed that
the first cries of the young shall be uttered

4
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:22,570
upon the anaesthetic air of a hospital, preferably
a fashionable one. So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,619
Button were fifty years ahead of style when
they decided, one day in the summer of 1860,

6
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:33,380
that their first baby should be born in a
hospital. Whether this anachronism had any

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,510
bearing upon the astonishing history I am
about to set down will never be known.

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,440
I shall tell you what occurred, and let you
judge for yourself.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,510
The Roger Buttons held an enviable position,
both social and financial, in ante - bellum

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,780
Baltimore. They were related to the This Family
and the That Family, which, as every Southerner

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,890
knew, entitled them to membership in that
enormous peerage which largely populated the

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,530
Confederacy. This was their first experience
with the charming old custom of having babies

13
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,640
- Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He hoped
it would be a boy so that he could be sent

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,890
to Yale College in Connecticut, at which institution
Mr. Button himself had been known for four

15
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,079
years by the somewhat obvious nickname of
"Cuff."

16
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,869
On the September morning consecrated to the
enormous event he arose nervously at six o'clock

17
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,229
dressed himself, adjusted an impeccable stock,
and hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore

18
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,250
to the hospital, to determine whether the
darkness of the night had borne in new life

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,710
upon its bosom.

20
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,549
When he was approximately a hundred yards
from the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies

21
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,490
and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the family
physician, descending the front steps, rubbing

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,060
his hands together with a washing movement
- as all doctors are required to do by the

23
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,700
unwritten ethics of their profession.

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,499
Mr. Roger Button, the president of Roger Button
& Co., Wholesale Hardware, began to run toward

25
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:08,209
Doctor Keene with much less dignity than was
expected from a Southern gentleman of that

26
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,660
picturesque period.

27
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,440
"Doctor Keene!" he called. "Oh, Doctor Keene!"

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,440
The doctor heard him, faced around, and stood
waiting, a curious expression settling on

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,340
his harsh, medicinal face as Mr. Button drew
near.

30
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:31,120
"What happened?" demanded Mr. Button, as he
came up in a gasping rush. "What was it? How

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
is she" A boy? Who is it? What -"

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,130
"Talk sense!" said Doctor Keene sharply, He
appeared somewhat irritated.

33
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,190
"Is the child born?" begged Mr. Button.

34
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,360
Doctor Keene frowned. "Why, yes, I suppose
so - after a fashion." Again he threw a curious

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,320
glance at Mr. Button.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,090
"Is my wife all right?"

37
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,090
"Yes."

38
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,620
"Is it a boy or a girl?"

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,980
"Here now!" cried Doctor Keene in a perfect
passion of irritation, "I'll ask you to go

40
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,700
and see for yourself. Outrageous!" He snapped
the last word out in almost one syllable,

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,340
then he turned away muttering: "Do you imagine
a case like this will help my professional

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,290
reputation? One more would ruin me - ruin
anybody."

43
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,790
"What's the matter?" demanded Mr. Button appalled.
"Triplets?"

44
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,150
"No, not triplets!" answered the doctor cuttingly.
"What's more, you can go and see for yourself.

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,730
And get another doctor. I brought you into
the world, young man, and I've been physician

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,610
to your family for forty years, but I'm through
with you! I don't want to see you or any of

47
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,909
your relatives ever again! Good - bye!"

48
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:53,230
Then he turned sharply, and without another
word climbed into his phaeton, which was waiting

49
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,430
at the curbstone, and drove severely away.

50
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,760
Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk,
stupefied and trembling from head to foot.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,600
What horrible mishap had occurred? He had
suddenly lost all desire to go into the Maryland

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,530
Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen
- it was with the greatest difficulty that,

53
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,379
a moment later, he forced himself to mount
the steps and enter the front door.

54
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:25,180
A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque
gloom of the hall. Swallowing his shame, Mr.

55
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,280
Button approached her.

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,009
"Good - morning," she remarked, looking up
at him pleasantly.

57
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,789
"Good - morning. I - I am Mr. Button."

58
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:39,580
At this a look of utter terror spread itself
over girl's face. She rose to her feet and

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,270
seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining
herself only with the most apparent difficulty.

60
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,740
"I want to see my child," said Mr. Button.

61
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:58,539
The nurse gave a little scream. "Oh - of course!"
she cried hysterically. "Upstairs. Right upstairs.

62
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,580
Go - up!"

63
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,440
She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button,
bathed in cool perspiration, turned falteringly,

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,930
and began to mount to the second floor. In
the upper hall he addressed another nurse

65
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:18,031
who approached him, basin in hand. "I'm Mr.
Button," he managed to articulate. "I want

66
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,031
to see my -"

67
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:24,199
Clank! The basin clattered to the floor and
rolled in the direction of the stairs. Clank!

68
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,749
Clank! I began a methodical decent as if sharing
in the general terror which this gentleman

69
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:30,939
provoked.

70
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:38,229
"I want to see my child!" Mr. Button almost
shrieked. He was on the verge of collapse.

71
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:43,449
Clank! The basin reached the first floor.
The nurse regained control of herself, and

72
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,060
threw Mr. Button a look of hearty contempt.

73
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:53,200
"All right, Mr. Button," she agreed in a hushed
voice. "Very well! But if you knew what a

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,639
state it's put us all in this morning! It's
perfectly outrageous! The hospital will never

75
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,759
have a ghost of a reputation after -"

76
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,970
"Hurry!" he cried hoarsely. "I can't stand
this!"

77
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,999
"Come this way, then, Mr. Button."

78
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:13,610
He dragged himself after her. At the end of
a long hall they reached a room from which

79
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,949
proceeded a variety of howls - indeed, a room
which, in later parlance, would have been

80
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,270
known as the "crying - room." They entered.

81
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,250
Ranged around the walls were half a dozen
white - enameled rolling cribs, each with

82
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,809
a tag tied at the head.

83
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:34,630
"Well," gasped Mr. Button, "which is mine?"

84
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,969
"There!" said the nurse.

85
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:42,830
Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger,
and this is what he saw. Wrapped in a voluminous

86
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,029
white blanket, and partly crammed into one
of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently

87
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:55,139
about seventy years of age. His sparse hair
was almost white, and from his chin dripped

88
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,580
a long smoke - coloured beard, which waved
absurdly back and forth, fanned by the breeze

89
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,849
coming in at the window. He looked up at Mr.
Button with dim, faded eyes in which lurked

90
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,860
a puzzled question.

91
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:16,800
"Am I mad?" thundered Mr. Button, his terror
resolving into rage. "Is this some ghastly

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
hospital joke?

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,960
"It doesn't seem like a joke to us," replied
the nurse severely. "And I don't know whether

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,240
you're mad or not - but that is most certainly
your child."

95
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,430
The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button's
forehead. He closed his eyes, and then, opening

96
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,749
them, looked again. There was no mistake - he
was gazing at a man of threescore and ten

97
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:48,919
- a baby of threescore and ten, a baby whose
feet hung over the sides of the crib in which

98
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,150
it was reposing.

99
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,580
The old man looked placidly from one to the
other for a moment, and then suddenly spoke

100
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,479
in a cracked and ancient voice. "Are you my
father?" he demanded.

101
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,139
Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.

102
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,520
"Because if you are," went on the old man
querulously, "I wish you'd get me out of this

103
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,569
place - or, at least, get them to put a comfortable
rocker in here,"

104
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:24,210
"Where in God's name did you come from? Who
are you?" burst out Mr. Button frantically.

105
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,219
"I can't tell you exactly who I am," replied
the querulous whine, "because I've only been

106
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,789
born a few hours - but my last name is certainly
Button."

107
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,539
"You lie! You're an impostor!"

108
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:45,529
The old man turned wearily to the nurse. "Nice
way to welcome a new - born child," he complained

109
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,810
in a weak voice. "Tell him he's wrong, why
don't you?"

110
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,810
"You're wrong. Mr. Button," said the nurse
severely. "This is your child, and you'll

111
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,170
have to make the best of it. We're going to
ask you to take him home with you as soon

112
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,290
as possible - some time to - day."

113
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,100
"Home?" repeated Mr. Button incredulously.

114
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,459
"Yes, we can't have him here. We really can't,
you know?"

115
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:16,490
"I'm right glad of it," whined the old man.
"This is a fine place to keep a youngster

116
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,560
of quiet tastes. With all this yelling and
howling, I haven't been able to get a wink

117
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,750
of sleep. I asked for something to eat" - here
his voice rose to a shrill note of protest

118
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,519
- "and they brought me a bottle of milk!"

119
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,120
Mr. Button sank down upon a chair near his
son and concealed his face in his hands. "My

120
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,870
heavens!" he murmured, in an ecstasy of horror.
"What will people say? What must I do?"

121
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,709
"You'll have to take him home," insisted the
nurse - "immediately!"

122
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,870
A grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful
clarity before the eyes of the tortured man

123
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,110
- a picture of himself walking through the
crowded streets of the city with this appalling

124
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:11,610
apparition stalking by his side. "I can't.
I can't," he moaned.

125
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,500
People would stop to speak to him, and what
was he going to say? He would have to introduce

126
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,720
this - this septuagenarian: "This is my son,
born early this morning." And then the old

127
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,540
man would gather his blanket around him and
they would plod on, past the bustling stores,

128
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,269
the slave market - for a dark instant Mr.
Button wished passionately that his son was

129
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:40,199
black - past the luxurious houses of the residential
district, past the home for the aged...

130
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,180
"Come! Pull yourself together," commanded
the nurse.

131
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,860
"See here," the old man announced suddenly,
"if you think I'm going to walk home in this

132
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,260
blanket, you're entirely mistaken."

133
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,620
"Babies always have blankets."

134
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,569
With a malicious crackle the old man held
up a small white swaddling garment. "Look!"

135
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:05,250
he quavered. "This is what they had ready
for me."

136
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,069
"Babies always wear those," said the nurse
primly.

137
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:15,430
"Well," said the old man, "this baby's not
going to wear anything in about two minutes.

138
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,690
This blanket itches. They might at least have
given me a sheet."

139
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:25,740
"Keep it on! Keep it on!" said Mr. Button
hurriedly. He turned to the nurse. "What'll

140
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,050
I do?"

141
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,330
"Go down town and buy your son some clothes."

142
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,974
Mr. Button's son's voice followed him down
into the: hall: "And a cane, father. I want

143
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:39,490
to have a cane."

144
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,540
Mr. Button banged the outer door savagely...

145
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
CHAPTER TWO

146
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,430
"Good - morning," Mr. Button said nervously,
to the clerk in the Chesapeake Dry Goods Company.

147
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,519
"I want to buy some clothes for my child."

148
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,470
"How old is your child, sir?"

149
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,129
"About six hours," answered Mr. Button, without
due consideration.

150
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,320
"Babies' supply department in the rear."

151
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:09,089
"Why, I don't think - I'm not sure that's
what I want. It's - he's an unusually large

152
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,610
- size child. Exceptionally - ah large."

153
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,470
"They have the largest child's sizes."

154
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,790
"Where is the boys' department?" inquired
Mr. Button, shifting his ground desperately.

155
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,069
He felt that the clerk must surely scent his
shameful secret.

156
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:27,069
"Right here."

157
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:34,170
"Well -" He hesitated. The notion of dressing
his son in men's clothes was repugnant to

158
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,370
him. If, say, he could only find a very large
boy's suit, he might cut off that long and

159
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:46,240
awful beard, dye the white hair brown, and
thus manage to conceal the worst, and to retain

160
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,630
something of his own self - respect - not
to mention his position in Baltimore society.

161
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,350
But a frantic inspection of the boys' department
revealed no suits to fit the new - born Button.

162
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,839
He blamed the store, of course - in such cases
it is the thing to blame the store.

163
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,930
"How old did you say that boy of yours was?"
demanded the clerk curiously.

164
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,060
"He's - sixteen."

165
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,100
"Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said
six hours. You'll find the youths' department

166
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,300
in the next aisle."

167
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,750
Mr. Button turned miserably away. Then he
stopped, brightened, and pointed his finger

168
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:31,540
toward a dressed dummy in the window display.
"There!" he exclaimed. "I'll take that suit,

169
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,140
out there on the dummy."

170
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:40,029
The clerk stared. "Why," he protested, "that's
not a child's suit. At least it is, but it's

171
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,980
for fancy dress. You could wear it yourself!"

172
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,940
"Wrap it up," insisted his customer nervously.
"That's what I want."

173
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,500
The astonished clerk obeyed.

174
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,819
Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the
nursery and almost threw the package at his

175
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:58,250
son. "Here's your clothes," he snapped out.

176
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,440
The old man untied the package and viewed
the contents with a quizzical eye.

177
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,029
"They look sort of funny to me," he complained,
"I don't want to be made a monkey of -"

178
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:15,009
"You've made a monkey of me!" retorted Mr.
Button fiercely. "Never you mind how funny

179
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:22,079
you look. Put them on - or I'll - or I'll
spank you." He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate

180
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,079
word, feeling nevertheless that it was the
proper thing to say.

181
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,269
"All right, father" - this with a grotesque
simulation of filial respect - "you've lived

182
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,220
longer; you know best. Just as you say."

183
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,810
As before, the sound of the word "father"
caused Mr. Button to start violently.

184
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,449
"And hurry."

185
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,910
"I'm hurrying, father."

186
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:51,779
When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded
him with depression. The costume consisted

187
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:57,790
of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted
blouse with a wide white collar. Over the

188
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:05,339
latter waved the long whitish beard, drooping
almost to the waist. The effect was not good.

189
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,769
"Wait!"

190
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:12,120
Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with
three quick snaps amputated a large section

191
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,860
of the beard. But even with this improvement
the ensemble fell far short of perfection.

192
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,279
The remaining brush of scraggly hair, the
watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly

193
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,029
out of tone with the gaiety of the costume.
Mr. Button, however, was obdurate - he held

194
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,649
out his hand. "Come along!" he said sternly.

195
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:39,779
His son took the hand trustingly. "What are
you going to call me, dad?" he quavered as

196
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:47,230
they walked from the nursery - "just 'baby'
for a while? till you think of a better name?"

197
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,950
Mr. Button grunted. "I don't know," he answered
harshly. "I think we'll call you Methuselah."

198
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,240
CHAPTER THREE

199
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,670
Even after the new addition to the Button
family had had his hair cut short and then

200
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,290
dyed to a sparse unnatural black, had had
his face shaved so dose that it glistened,

201
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,300
and had been attired in small - boy clothes
made to order by a flabbergasted tailor, it

202
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,759
was impossible for Button to ignore the fact
that his son was a excuse for a first family

203
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,499
baby. Despite his aged stoop, Benjamin Button
- for it was by this name they called him

204
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:31,180
instead of by the appropriate but invidious
Methuselah - was five feet eight inches tall.

205
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,379
His clothes did not conceal this, nor did
the clipping and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise

206
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:42,720
the fact that the eyes under - were faded
and watery and tired. In fact, the baby - nurse

207
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,790
who had been engaged in advance left the house
after one look, in a state of considerable

208
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,860
indignation.

209
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:55,519
But Mr. Button persisted in his unwavering
purpose. Benjamin was a baby, and a baby he

210
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,189
should remain. At first he declared that if
Benjamin didn't like warm milk he could go

211
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:05,500
without food altogether, but he was finally
prevailed upon to allow his son bread and

212
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,829
butter, and even oatmeal by way of a compromise.
One day he brought home a rattle and, giving

213
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:17,500
it to Benjamin, insisted in no uncertain terms
that he should "play with it," whereupon the

214
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,220
old man took it with - a weary expression
and could be heard jingling it obediently

215
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,230
at intervals throughout the day.

216
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,710
There can be no doubt, though, that the rattle
bored him, and that he found other and more

217
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:35,030
soothing amusements when he was left alone.
For instance, Mr. Button discovered one day

218
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,490
that during the preceding week be had smoked
more cigars than ever before - a phenomenon,

219
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,909
which was explained a few days later when,
entering the nursery unexpectedly, he found

220
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:51,909
the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin,
with a guilty expression on his face, trying

221
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:57,880
to conceal the butt of a dark Havana.This,
of course, called for a severe spanking, but

222
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Mr. Button found that he could not bring himself
to administer it. He merely warned his son

223
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,440
that he would "stunt his growth."

224
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,090
Nevertheless he persisted in his attitude.
He brought home lead soldiers, he brought

225
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,900
toy trains, he brought large pleasant animals
made of cotton, and, to perfect the illusion

226
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,780
which he was creating - for himself at least
- he passionately demanded of the clerk in

227
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,850
the toy - store whether "the paint would come
oft the pink duck if the baby put it in his

228
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:34,020
mouth." But, despite all his father's efforts,
Benjamin refused to be interested. He would

229
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,830
steal down the back stairs and return to the
nursery with a volume of the Encyclopedia

230
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:44,110
Britannica, over which he would pore through
an afternoon, while his cotton cows and his

231
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,480
Noah's ark were left neglected on the floor.
Against such a stubbornness Mr. Button's efforts

232
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,770
were of little avail.

233
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,820
The sensation created in Baltimore was, at
first, prodigious. What the mishap would have

234
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,570
cost the Buttons and their kinsfolk socially
cannot be determined, for the outbreak of

235
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:09,110
the Civil War drew the city's attention to
other things. A few people who were unfailingly

236
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,050
polite racked their brains for compliments
to give to the parents - and finally hit upon

237
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,919
the ingenious device of declaring that the
baby resembled his grandfather, a fact which,

238
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,130
due to the standard state of decay common
to all men of seventy, could not be denied.

239
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:32,400
Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were not pleased,
and Benjamin's grandfather was furiously insulted.

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,460
Benjamin, once he left the hospital, took
life as he found it. Several small boys were

241
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,320
brought to see him, and he spent a stiff - jointed
afternoon trying to work up an interest in

242
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,799
tops and marbles - he even managed, quite
accidentally, to break a kitchen window with

243
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,860
a stone from a sling shot, a feat which secretly
delighted his father.

244
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,540
Thereafter Benjamin contrived to break something
every day, but he did these things only because

245
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,409
they were expected of him, and because he
was by nature obliging.

246
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:11,529
When his grandfather's initial antagonism
wore off, Benjamin and that gentleman took

247
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:16,860
enormous pleasure in one another's company.
They would sit for hours, these two, so far

248
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,510
apart in age and experience, and, like old
cronies, discuss with tireless monotony the

249
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,159
slow events of the day. Benjamin felt more
at ease in his grandfather's presence than

250
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,809
in his parents' - they seemed always somewhat
in awe of him and, despite the dictatorial

251
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:39,390
authority they exercised over him, frequently
addressed him as "Mr."

252
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:45,610
He was as puzzled as any one else at the apparently
advanced age of his mind and body at birth.

253
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,190
He read up on it in the medical journal, but
found that no such case had been previously

254
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,720
recorded. At his father's urging he made an
honest attempt to play with other boys, and

255
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,230
frequently he joined in the milder games - football
shook him up too much, and he feared that

256
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,929
in case of a fracture his ancient bones would
refuse to knit.

257
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:12,130
When he was five he was sent to kindergarten,
where he initiated into the art of pasting

258
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:20,100
green paper on orange paper, of weaving coloured
maps and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces.

259
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,390
He was inclined to drowse off to sleep in
the middle of these tasks, a habit which both

260
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,799
irritated and frightened his young teacher.
To his relief she complained to his parents,

261
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,029
and he was removed from the school. The Roger
Buttons told their friends that they felt

262
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,200
he was too young.

263
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,809
By the time he was twelve years old his parents
had grown used to him. Indeed, so strong is

264
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,330
the force of custom that they no longer felt
that he was different from any other child

265
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:54,690
- except when some curious anomaly reminded
them of the fact. But one day a few weeks

266
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,760
after his twelfth birthday, while looking
in the mirror, Benjamin made, or thought he

267
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,200
made, an astonishing discovery. Did his eyes
deceive him, or had his hair turned in the

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,510
dozen years of his life from white to iron
- gray under its concealing dye? Was the network

269
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:21,940
of wrinkles on his face becoming less pronounced?
Was his skin healthier and firmer, with even

270
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,600
a touch of ruddy winter colour? He could not
tell. He knew that he no longer stooped, and

271
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,320
that his physical condition had improved since
the early days of his life.

272
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,960
"Can it be - ?" he thought to himself, or,
rather, scarcely dared to think.

273
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,720
He went to his father. "I am grown," he announced
determinedly. "I want to put on long trousers."

274
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:56,429
His father hesitated. "Well," he said finally,
"I don't know. Fourteen is the age for putting

275
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:00,669
on long trousers - and you are only twelve."

276
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:06,570
"But you'll have to admit," protested Benjamin,
"that I'm big for my age."

277
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:13,419
His father looked at him with illusory speculation.
"Oh, I'm not so sure of that," he said. "I

278
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,169
was as big as you when I was twelve."

279
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,370
This was not true - it was all part of Roger
Button's silent agreement with himself to

280
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,049
believe in his son's normality.

281
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:30,171
Finally a compromise was reached. Benjamin
was to continue to dye his hair. He was to

282
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:35,700
make a better attempt to play with boys of
his own age. He was not to wear his spectacles

283
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,529
or carry a cane in the street. In return for
these concessions he was allowed his first

284
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,980
suit of long trousers...

285
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
CHAPTER FOUR

286
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,210
Of the life of Benjamin Button between his
twelfth and twenty - first year I intend to

287
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,039
say little. Suffice to record that they were
years of normal ungrowth. When Benjamin was

288
00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:01,059
eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty; he
had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his

289
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:07,760
step was firm, his voice had lost its cracked
quaver and descended to a healthy baritone.

290
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,679
So his father sent him up to Connecticut to
take examinations for entrance to Yale College.

291
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,519
Benjamin passed his examination and became
a member of the freshman class.

292
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,299
On the third day following his matriculation
he received a notification from Mr. Hart,

293
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,179
the college registrar, to call at his office
and arrange his schedule. Benjamin, glancing

294
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:34,640
in the mirror, decided that his hair needed
a new application of its brown dye, but an

295
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,340
anxious inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed
that the dye bottle was not there. Then he

296
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:45,350
remembered - he had emptied it the day before
and thrown it away.

297
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:51,470
He was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar's
in five minutes. There seemed to be no help

298
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,620
for it - he must go as he was. He did.

299
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,940
"Good - morning," said the registrar politely.
"You've come to inquire about your son."

300
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:08,269
"Why, as a matter of fact, my name's Button
-" began Benjamin, but Mr. Hart cut him off.

301
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:12,659
"I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I'm
expecting your son here any minute."

302
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,440
"That's me!" burst out Benjamin. "I'm a freshman."

303
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,630
"What!"

304
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,200
"I'm a freshman."

305
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,990
"Surely you're joking."

306
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,250
"Not at all."

307
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,260
The registrar frowned and glanced at a card
before him. "Why, I have Mr. Benjamin Button's

308
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,570
age down here as eighteen."

309
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,480
"That's my age," asserted Benjamin, flushing
slightly.

310
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,460
The registrar eyed him wearily. "Now surely,
Mr. Button, you don't expect me to believe

311
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,730
that."

312
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,510
Benjamin smiled wearily. "I am eighteen,"
he repeated.

313
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,299
The registrar pointed sternly to the door.
"Get out," he said. "Get out of college and

314
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,630
get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic."

315
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,350
"I am eighteen."

316
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:09,940
Mr. Hart opened the door. "The idea!" he shouted.
"A man of your age trying to enter here as

317
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,730
a freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well,
I'll give you eighteen minutes to get out

318
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,950
of town."

319
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,450
Benjamin Button walked with dignity from the
room, and half a dozen undergraduates, who

320
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,350
were waiting in the hall, followed him curiously
with their eyes. When he had gone a little

321
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,970
way he turned around, faced the infuriated
registrar, who was still standing in the door

322
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:40,309
- way, and repeated in a firm voice: "I am
eighteen years old."

323
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,900
To a chorus of titters which went up from
the group of undergraduates, Benjamin walked

324
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,519
away.

325
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:52,539
But he was not fated to escape so easily.
On his melancholy walk to the railroad station

326
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:58,480
he found that he was being followed by a group,
then by a swarm, and finally by a dense mass

327
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,269
of undergraduates. The word had gone around
that a lunatic had passed the entrance examinations

328
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:11,470
for Yale and attempted to palm himself off
as a youth of eighteen. A fever of excitement

329
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:17,340
permeated the college. Men ran hatless out
of classes, the football team abandoned its

330
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,049
practice and joined the mob, professors' wives
with bonnets awry and bustles out of position,

331
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:28,019
ran shouting after the procession, from which
proceeded a continual succession of remarks

332
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,670
aimed at the tender sensibilities of Benjamin
Button.

333
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,550
"He must be the Wandering Jew!"

334
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,269
"He ought to go to prep school at his age!"

335
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,650
"Look at the infant prodigy!"

336
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,490
"He thought this was the old men's home."

337
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,490
"Go up to Harvard!"

338
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,059
Benjamin increased his gait, and soon he was
running. He would show them! He would go to

339
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:56,380
Harvard, and then they would regret these
ill - considered taunts!

340
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,100
Safely on board the train for Baltimore, he
put his head from the window. "You'll regret

341
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,350
this!" he shouted.

342
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:11,419
"Ha - ha!" the undergraduates laughed. "Ha
- ha - ha!" It was the biggest mistake that

343
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,450
Yale College had ever made...

344
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,109
CHAPTER FIVE

345
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:20,030
In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old,
and he signalised his birthday by going to

346
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,809
work for his father in Roger Button & Co.,
Wholesale Hardware. It was in that same year

347
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:31,639
that he began "going out socially" - that
is, his father insisted on taking him to several

348
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:38,710
fashionable dances. Roger Button was now fifty,
and he and his son were more and more companionable

349
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:44,820
- in fact, since Benjamin had ceased to dye
his hair (which was still grayish) they appeared

350
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,669
about the same age, and could have passed
for brothers.

351
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:54,330
One night in August they got into the phaeton
attired in their full - dress suits and drove

352
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:00,130
out to a dance at the Shevlins' country house,
situated just outside of Baltimore. It was

353
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,909
a gorgeous evening. A full moon drenched the
road to the lustreless colour of platinum,

354
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:10,730
and late - blooming harvest flowers breathed
into the motionless air aromas that were like

355
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:16,980
low, half - heard laughter. The open country,
carpeted for rods around with bright wheat,

356
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,480
was translucent as in the day. It was almost
impossible not to be affected by the sheer

357
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,140
beauty of the sky - almost.

358
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,360
"There's a great future in the dry - goods
business," Roger Button was saying. He was

359
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,870
not a spiritual man - his aesthetic sense
was rudimentary.

360
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:42,010
"Old fellows like me can't learn new tricks,"
he observed profoundly. "It's you youngsters

361
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,580
with energy and vitality that have the great
future before you."

362
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:51,010
Far up the road the lights of the Shevlins'
country house drifted into view, and presently

363
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:56,539
there was a sighing sound that crept persistently
toward them - it might have been the fine

364
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:01,419
plaint of violins or the rustle of the silver
wheat under the moon.

365
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,740
They pulled up behind a handsome brougham
whose passengers were disembarking at the

366
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:15,419
door. A lady got out, then an elderly gentleman,
then another young lady, beautiful as sin.

367
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,990
Benjamin started; an almost chemical change
seemed to dissolve and recompose the very

368
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:28,060
elements of his body. A rigour passed over
him, blood rose into his cheeks, his forehead,

369
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,529
and there was a steady thumping in his ears.
It was first love.

370
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:39,059
The girl was slender and frail, with hair
that was ashen under the moon and honey - coloured

371
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:45,350
under the sputtering gas - lamps of the porch.
Over her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla

372
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:51,610
of softest yellow, butterflied in black; her
feet were glittering buttons at the hem of

373
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,799
her bustled dress.

374
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:01,070
Roger Button leaned over to his son. "That,"
he said, "is young Hildegarde Moncrief, the

375
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,490
daughter of General Moncrief."

376
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,679
Benjamin nodded coldly. "Pretty little thing,"
he said indifferently. But when the negro

377
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,529
boy had led the buggy away, he added: "Dad,
you might introduce me to her."

378
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:23,570
They approached a group, of which Miss Moncrief
was the centre. Reared in the old tradition,

379
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:29,390
she curtsied low before Benjamin. Yes, he
might have a dance. He thanked her and walked

380
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,429
away - staggered away.

381
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:38,309
The interval until the time for his turn should
arrive dragged itself out interminably. He

382
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:44,160
stood close to the wall, silent, inscrutable,
watching with murderous eyes the young bloods

383
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,679
of Baltimore as they eddied around Hildegarde
Moncrief, passionate admiration in their faces.

384
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:56,919
How obnoxious they seemed to Benjamin; how
intolerably rosy! Their curling brown whiskers

385
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,250
aroused in him a feeling equivalent to indigestion.

386
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:06,159
But when his own time came, and he drifted
with her out upon the changing floor to the

387
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,600
music of the latest waltz from Paris, his
jealousies and anxieties melted from him like

388
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,150
a mantle of snow. Blind with enchantment,
he felt that life was just beginning.

389
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:24,340
"You and your brother got here just as we
did, didn't you?" asked Hildegarde, looking

390
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,620
up at him with eyes that were like bright
blue enamel.

391
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,390
Benjamin hesitated. If she took him for his
father's brother, would it be best to enlighten

392
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:39,460
her? He remembered his experience at Yale,
so he decided against it. It would be rude

393
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,610
to contradict a lady; it would be criminal
to mar this exquisite occasion with the grotesque

394
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:52,530
story of his origin. Later, perhaps. So he
nodded, smiled, listened, was happy.

395
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:58,200
"I like men of your age," Hildegarde told
him. "Young boys are so idiotic. They tell

396
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,789
me how much champagne they drink at college,
and how much money they lose playing cards.

397
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:06,580
Men of your age know how to appreciate women."

398
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:13,120
Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal
- with an effort he choked back the impulse.

399
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,649
"You're just the romantic age," she continued
- "fifty. Twenty - five is too wordly - wise;

400
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:25,860
thirty is apt to be pale from overwork; forty
is the age of long stories that take a whole

401
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:34,070
cigar to tell; sixty is - oh, sixty is too
near seventy; but fifty is the mellow age.

402
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,600
I love fifty."

403
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,080
Fifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious age. He
longed passionately to be fifty.

404
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,850
"I've always said," went on Hildegarde, "that
I'd rather marry a man of fifty and be taken

405
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:53,679
care of than many a man of thirty and take
care of him."

406
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,130
For Benjamin the rest of the evening was bathed
in a honey - coloured mist. Hildegarde gave

407
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,880
him two more dances, and they discovered that
they were marvellously in accord on all the

408
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,480
questions of the day. She was to go driving
with him on the following Sunday, and then

409
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,540
they would discuss all these questions further.

410
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,690
Going home in the phaeton just before the
crack of dawn, when the first bees were humming

411
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,670
and the fading moon glimmered in the cool
dew, Benjamin knew vaguely that his father

412
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,460
was discussing wholesale hardware.

413
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,899
"... And what do you think should merit our
biggest attention after hammers and nails?"

414
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,030
the elder Button was saying.

415
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,159
"Love," replied Benjamin absent - mindedly.

416
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:44,170
"Lugs?" exclaimed Roger Button, "Why, I've
just covered the question of lugs."

417
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:49,050
Benjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just
as the eastern sky was suddenly cracked with

418
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,830
light, and an oriole yawned piercingly in
the quickening trees...

419
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,260
CHAPTER SIX

420
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,730
When, six months later, the engagement of
Miss Hildegarde Moncrief to Mr. Benjamin Button

421
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:04,359
was made known (I say "made known," for General
Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon

422
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:11,260
his sword than announce it), the excitement
in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch.

423
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,930
The almost forgotten story of Benjamin's birth
was remembered and sent out upon the winds

424
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:24,030
of scandal in picaresque and incredible forms.
It was said that Benjamin was really the father

425
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,600
of Roger Button, that he was his brother who
had been in prison for forty years, that he

426
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:36,570
was John Wilkes Booth in disguise - and, finally,
that he had two small conical horns sprouting

427
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,540
from his head.

428
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,420
The Sunday supplements of the New York papers
played up the case with fascinating sketches

429
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,841
which showed the head of Benjamin Button attached
to a fish, to a snake, and, finally, to a

430
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:57,090
body of solid brass. He became known, journalistically,
as the Mystery Man of Maryland. But the true

431
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:02,099
story, as is usually the case, had a very
small circulation.

432
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,480
However, every one agreed with General Moncrief
that it was "criminal" for a lovely girl who

433
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,069
could have married any beau in Baltimore to
throw herself into the arms of a man who was

434
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:21,000
assuredly fifty. In vain Mr. Roger Button
published Us son's birth certificate in large

435
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,840
type in the Baltimore Blaze. No one believed
it. You had only to look at Benjamin and see.

436
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,180
On the part of the two people most concerned
there was no wavering. So many of the stories

437
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,520
about her fiance were false that Hildegarde
refused stubbornly to believe even the true

438
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,540
one. In vain General Moncrief pointed out
to her the high mortality among men of fifty

439
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,260
- or, at least, among men who looked fifty;
in vain he told her of the instability of

440
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:58,980
the wholesale hardware business. Hildegarde
had chosen to marry for mellowness, and marry

441
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
she did...

442
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
CHAPTER SEVEN

443
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:06,089
In one particular, at least, the friends of
Hildegarde Moncrief were mistaken. The wholesale

444
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:12,200
hardware business prospered amazingly. In
the fifteen years between Benjamin Button's

445
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,780
marriage in 1880 and his father's retirement
in 1895, the family fortune was doubled - and

446
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,550
this was due largely to the younger member
of the firm.

447
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:30,530
Needless to say, Baltimore eventually received
the couple to its bosom. Even old General

448
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,540
Moncrief became reconciled to his son - in
- law when Benjamin gave him the money to

449
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:40,260
bring out his History of the Civil War in
twenty volumes, which had been refused by

450
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,010
nine prominent publishers.

451
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,970
In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought
many changes. It seemed to him that the blood

452
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,910
flowed with new vigour through his veins.
It began to be a pleasure to rise in the morning,

453
00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:00,330
to walk with an active step along the busy,
sunny street, to work untiringly with his

454
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:07,220
shipments of hammers and his cargoes of nails.
It was in 1890 that he executed his famous

455
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,810
business coup: he brought up the suggestion
that all nails used in nailing up the boxes

456
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:18,790
in which nails are shipped are the property
of the shippee, a proposal which became a

457
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:24,481
statute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile,
and saved Roger Button and Company, Wholesale

458
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:28,610
Hardware, more than six hundred nails every
year.

459
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:33,430
In addition, Benjamin discovered that he was
becoming more and more attracted by the gay

460
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:39,180
side of life. It was typical of his growing
enthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first

461
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:45,290
man in the city of Baltimore to own and run
an automobile. Meeting him on the street,

462
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:50,540
his contemporaries would stare enviously at
the picture he made of health and vitality.

463
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:57,430
"He seems to grow younger every year," they
would remark. And if old Roger Button, now

464
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,560
sixty - five years old, had failed at first
to give a proper welcome to his son he atoned

465
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,290
at last by bestowing on him what amounted
to adulation.

466
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,980
And here we come to an unpleasant subject
which it will be well to pass over as quickly

467
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,319
as possible. There was only one thing that
worried Benjamin Button; his wife had ceased

468
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,089
to attract him.

469
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:26,630
At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty
- five, with a son, Roscoe, fourteen years

470
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,700
old. In the early days of their marriage Benjamin
had worshipped her. But, as the years passed,

471
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,369
her honey - coloured hair became an unexciting
brown, the blue enamel of her eyes assumed

472
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:43,800
the aspect of cheap crockery - moreover, and,
most of all, she had become too settled in

473
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,940
her ways, too placid, too content, too anaemic
in her excitements, and too sober in her taste.

474
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:58,760
As a bride it been she who had "dragged" Benjamin
to dances and dinners - now conditions were

475
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,430
reversed. She went out socially with him,
but without enthusiasm, devoured already by

476
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:10,059
that eternal inertia which comes to live with
each of us one day and stays with us to the

477
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,319
end.

478
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:17,069
Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger. At the
outbreak of the Spanish - American War in

479
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:23,940
1898 his home had for him so little charm
that he decided to join the army. With his

480
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,810
business influence he obtained a commission
as captain, and proved so adaptable to the

481
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:35,670
work that he was made a major, and finally
a lieutenant - colonel just in time to participate

482
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:44,460
in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill.
He was slightly wounded, and received a medal.

483
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,950
Benjamin had become so attached to the activity
and excitement of array life that he regretted

484
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:57,079
to give it up, but his business required attention,
so he resigned his commission and came home.

485
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:02,000
He was met at the station by a brass band
and escorted to his house.

486
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
CHAPTER EIGHT

487
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,170
Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted
him on the porch, and even as he kissed her

488
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,829
he felt with a sinking of the heart that these
three years had taken their toll. She was

489
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:19,750
a woman of forty now, with a faint skirmish
line of gray hairs in her head. The sight

490
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,500
depressed him.

491
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,000
Up in his room he saw his reflection in the
familiar mirror - he went closer and examined

492
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,070
his own face with anxiety, comparing it after
a moment with a photograph of himself in uniform

493
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,300
taken just before the war.

494
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,010
"Good Lord!" he said aloud. The process was
continuing. There was no doubt of it - he

495
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:49,990
looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of
being delighted, he was uneasy - he was growing

496
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:57,310
younger. He had hitherto hoped that once he
reached a bodily age equivalent to his age

497
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:02,750
in years, the grotesque phenomenon which had
marked his birth would cease to function.

498
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:09,580
He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him awful,
incredible.

499
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:15,000
When he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting
for him. She appeared annoyed, and he wondered

500
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,080
if she had at last discovered that there was
something amiss. It was with an effort to

501
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,770
relieve the tension between them that he broached
the matter at dinner in what he considered

502
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,630
a delicate way.

503
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,330
"Well," he remarked lightly, "everybody says
I look younger than ever."

504
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:38,520
Hildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed.
"Do you think it's anything to boast about?"

505
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,380
"I'm not boasting," he asserted uncomfortably.

506
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:49,240
She sniffed again. "The idea," she said, and
after a moment: "I should think you'd have

507
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,320
enough pride to stop it."

508
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,540
"How can I?" he demanded.

509
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,710
"I'm not going to argue with you," she retorted.
"But there's a right way of doing things and

510
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,540
a wrong way. If you've made up your mind to
be different from everybody else, I don't

511
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,930
suppose I can stop you, but I really don't
think it's very considerate."

512
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,079
"But, Hildegarde, I can't help it."

513
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,530
"You can too. You're simply stubborn. You
think you don't want to be like any one else.

514
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:24,609
You always have been that way, and you always
will be. But just think how it would be if

515
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:30,180
every one else looked at things as you do
- what would the world be like?"

516
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:36,760
As this was an inane and unanswerable argument
Benjamin made no reply, and from that time

517
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,059
on a chasm began to widen between them. He
wondered what possible fascination she had

518
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:46,250
ever exercised over him.

519
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,329
To add to the breach, he found, as the new
century gathered headway, that his thirst

520
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:57,780
for gaiety grew stronger. Never a party of
any kind in the city of Baltimore but he was

521
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,790
there, dancing with the prettiest of the young
married women, chatting with the most popular

522
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:09,020
of the debutantes, and finding their company
charming, while his wife, a dowager of evil

523
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:15,940
omen, sat among the chaperons, now in haughty
disapproval, and now following him with solemn,

524
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,020
puzzled, and reproachful eyes.

525
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:25,369
"Look!" people would remark. "What a pity!
A young fellow that age tied to a woman of

526
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:32,210
forty - five. He must be twenty years younger
than his wife." They had forgotten - as people

527
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,450
inevitably forget - that back in 1880 their
mammas and papas had also remarked about this

528
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,490
same ill - matched pair.

529
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:46,680
Benjamin's growing unhappiness at home was
compensated for by his many new interests.

530
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:53,089
He took up golf and made a great success of
it. He went in for dancing: in 1906 he was

531
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:59,339
an expert at "The Boston," and in 1908 he
was considered proficient at the "Maxine,"

532
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:06,020
while in 1909 his "Castle Walk" was the envy
of every young man in town.

533
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,630
His social activities, of course, interfered
to some extent with his business, but then

534
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:15,410
he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for
twenty - five years and felt that he could

535
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:21,859
soon hand it on to his son, Roscoe, who had
recently graduated from Harvard.

536
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:28,260
He and his son were, in fact, often mistaken
for each other. This pleased Benjamin - he

537
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,410
soon forgot the insidious fear which had come
over him on his return from the Spanish - American

538
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:40,089
War, and grew to take a naive pleasure in
his appearance. There was only one fly in

539
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:47,369
the delicious ointment - he hated to appear
in public with his wife. Hildegarde was almost

540
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:51,109
fifty, and the sight of her made him feel
absurd...

541
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:52,109
CHAPTER NINE

542
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:58,050
One September day in 1910 - a few years after
Roger Button & Co., Wholesale Hardware, had

543
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:03,590
been handed over to young Roscoe Button - a
man, apparently about twenty years old, entered

544
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:09,490
himself as a freshman at Harvard University
in Cambridge. He did not make the mistake

545
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:15,150
of announcing that he would never see fifty
again, nor did he mention the fact that his

546
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:20,430
son had been graduated from the same institution
ten years before.

547
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:25,369
He was admitted, and almost immediately attained
a prominent position in the class, partly

548
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:29,690
because he seemed a little older than the
other freshmen, whose average age was about

549
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,190
eighteen.

550
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:36,329
But his success was largely due to the fact
that in the football game with Yale he played

551
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:42,790
so brilliantly, with so much dash and with
such a cold, remorseless anger that he scored

552
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:49,290
seven touchdowns and fourteen field goals
for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven

553
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:55,430
of Yale men to be carried singly from the
field, unconscious. He was the most celebrated

554
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,780
man in college.

555
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,210
Strange to say, in his third or junior year
he was scarcely able to "make" the team. The

556
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,829
coaches said that he had lost weight, and
it seemed to the more observant among them

557
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:13,349
that he was not quite as tall as before. He
made no touchdowns - indeed, he was retained

558
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:18,980
on the team chiefly in hope that his enormous
reputation would bring terror and disorganisation

559
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,130
to the Yale team.

560
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:28,059
In his senior year he did not make the team
at all. He had grown so slight and frail that

561
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:34,050
one day he was taken by some sophomores for
a freshman, an incident which humiliated him

562
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:39,760
terribly. He became known as something of
a prodigy - a senior who was surely no more

563
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,200
than sixteen - and he was often shocked at
the worldliness of some of his classmates.

564
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,450
His studies seemed harder to him - he felt
that they were too advanced. He had heard

565
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:57,059
his classmates speak of St. Midas's, the famous
preparatory school, at which so many of them

566
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:02,330
had prepared for college, and he determined
after his graduation to enter himself at St.

567
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:09,660
Midas's, where the sheltered life among boys
his own size would be more congenial to him.

568
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,890
Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to
Baltimore with his Harvard diploma in his

569
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:21,960
pocket. Hildegarde was now residing in Italy,
so Benjamin went to live with his son, Roscoe.

570
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,790
But though he was welcomed in a general way
there was obviously no heartiness in Roscoe's

571
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:33,980
feeling toward him - there was even perceptible
a tendency on his son's part to think that

572
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:40,240
Benjamin, as he moped about the house in adolescent
mooniness, was somewhat in the way. Roscoe

573
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,829
was married now and prominent in Baltimore
life, and he wanted no scandal to creep out

574
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:48,480
in connection with his family.

575
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,090
Benjamin, no longer persona grata with the
debutantes and younger college set, found

576
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:59,930
himself left much done, except for the companionship
of three or four fifteen - year - old boys

577
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,570
in the neighbourhood. His idea of going to
St. Midas's school recurred to him.

578
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:11,180
"Say," he said to Roscoe one day, "I've told
you over and over that I want to go to prep,

579
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,180
school."

580
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:17,559
"Well, go, then," replied Roscoe shortly.
The matter was distasteful to him, and he

581
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,370
wished to avoid a discussion.

582
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:25,900
"I can't go alone," said Benjamin helplessly.
"You'll have to enter me and take me up there."

583
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:32,410
"I haven't got time," declared Roscoe abruptly.
His eyes narrowed and he looked uneasily at

584
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,119
his father. "As a matter of fact," he added,
"you'd better not go on with this business

585
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:44,100
much longer. You better pull up short. You
better - you better" - he paused and his face

586
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,560
crimsoned as he sought for words - "you better
turn right around and start back the other

587
00:49:49,560 --> 00:50:00,349
way. This has gone too far to be a joke. It
isn't funny any longer. You - you behave yourself!"

588
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:03,190
Benjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.

589
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:08,220
"And another thing," continued Roscoe, "when
visitors are in the house I want you to call

590
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:15,030
me 'Uncle' - not 'Roscoe,' but 'Uncle,' do
you understand? It looks absurd for a boy

591
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,930
of fifteen to call me by my first name. Perhaps
you'd better call me 'Uncle' all the time,

592
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,280
so you'll get used to it."

593
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,330
With a harsh look at his father, Roscoe turned
away...

594
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,330
CHAPTER TEN

595
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:32,380
At the termination of this interview, Benjamin
wandered dismally upstairs and stared at himself

596
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,680
in the mirror. He had not shaved for three
months, but he could find nothing on his face

597
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,440
but a faint white down with which it seemed
unnecessary to meddle. When he had first come

598
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,829
home from Harvard, Roscoe had approached him
with the proposition that he should wear eye

599
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:53,780
- glasses and imitation whiskers glued to
his cheeks, and it had seemed for a moment

600
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,809
that the farce of his early years was to be
repeated. But whiskers had itched and made

601
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:04,829
him ashamed. He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly
relented.

602
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:10,859
Benjamin opened a book of boys' stories, The
Boy Scouts in Bimini Bay, and began to read.

603
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:15,680
But he found himself thinking persistently
about the war. America had joined the Allied

604
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,160
cause during the preceding month, and Benjamin
wanted to enlist, but, alas, sixteen was the

605
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,690
minimum age, and he did not look that old.
His true age, which was fifty - seven, would

606
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,079
have disqualified him, anyway.

607
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,829
There was a knock at his door, and the butler
appeared with a letter bearing a large official

608
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:42,650
legend in the corner and addressed to Mr.
Benjamin Button. Benjamin tore it open eagerly,

609
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:48,190
and read the enclosure with delight. It informed
him that many reserve officers who had served

610
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:54,030
in the Spanish - American War were being called
back into service with a higher rank, and

611
00:51:54,030 --> 00:52:01,220
it enclosed his commission as brigadier - general
in the United States army with orders to report

612
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,160
immediately.

613
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,060
Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering
with enthusiasm. This was what he had wanted.

614
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:15,069
He seized his cap, and ten minutes later he
had entered a large tailoring establishment

615
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:21,000
on Charles Street, and asked in his uncertain
treble to be measured for a uniform.

616
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,740
"Want to play soldier, sonny?" demanded a
clerk casually.

617
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:33,250
Benjamin flushed. "Say! Never mind what I
want!" he retorted angrily. "My name's Button

618
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,540
and I live on Mt. Vernon Place, so you know
I'm good for it."

619
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:44,480
"Well," admitted the clerk hesitantly, "if
you're not, I guess your daddy is, all right."

620
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,349
Benjamin was measured, and a week later his
uniform was completed. He had difficulty in

621
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:54,620
obtaining the proper general's insignia because
the dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that

622
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:01,569
a nice Y.M.C.A. badge would look just as well
and be much more fun to play with.

623
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:06,760
Saying nothing to Roscoe, he left the house
one night and proceeded by train to Camp Mosby,

624
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:13,160
in South Carolina, where he was to command
an infantry brigade. On a sultry April day

625
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,070
he approached the entrance to the camp, paid
off the taxicab which had brought him from

626
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,510
the station, and turned to the sentry on guard.

627
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,319
"Get some one to handle my luggage!" he said
briskly.

628
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:32,079
The sentry eyed him reproachfully. "Say,"
he remarked, "where you goin' with the general's

629
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,579
duds, sonny?"

630
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:38,960
Benjamin, veteran of the Spanish - American
War, whirled upon him with fire in his eye,

631
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,410
but with, alas, a changing treble voice.

632
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:48,960
"Come to attention!" he tried to thunder;
he paused for breath - then suddenly he saw

633
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,900
the sentry snap his heels together and bring
his rifle to the present. Benjamin concealed

634
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:00,100
a smile of gratification, but when he glanced
around his smile faded. It was not he who

635
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:06,070
had inspired obedience, but an imposing artillery
colonel who was approaching on horseback.

636
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,200
"Colonel!" called Benjamin shrilly.

637
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,470
The colonel came up, drew rein, and looked
coolly down at him with a twinkle in his eyes.

638
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,950
"Whose little boy are you?" he demanded kindly.

639
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:24,160
"I'll soon darn well show you whose little
boy I am!" retorted Benjamin in a ferocious

640
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,190
voice. "Get down off that horse!"

641
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,460
The colonel roared with laughter.

642
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,740
"You want him, eh, general?"

643
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:37,970
"Here!" cried Benjamin desperately. "Read
this." And he thrust his commission toward

644
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,099
the colonel.

645
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:42,410
The colonel read it, his eyes popping from
their sockets.

646
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:47,510
"Where'd you get this?" he demanded, slipping
the document into his own pocket.

647
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,660
"I got it from the Government, as you'll soon
find out!"

648
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:57,170
"You come along with me," said the colonel
with a peculiar look. "We'll go up to headquarters

649
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,210
and talk this over. Come along."

650
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:05,150
The colonel turned and began walking his horse
in the direction of headquarters. There was

651
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:10,839
nothing for Benjamin to do but follow with
as much dignity as possible - meanwhile promising

652
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:13,859
himself a stern revenge.

653
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:20,170
But this revenge did not materialise. Two
days later, however, his son Roscoe materialised

654
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:27,410
from Baltimore, hot and cross from a hasty
trip, and escorted the weeping general, sans

655
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,040
uniform, back to his home.

656
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
CHAPTER ELEVEN

657
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,690
In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born.
During the attendant festivities, however,

658
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:40,789
no one thought it "the thing" to mention,
that the little grubby boy, apparently about

659
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:46,170
ten years of age who played around the house
with lead soldiers and a miniature circus,

660
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,680
was the new baby's own grandfather.

661
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,460
No one disliked the little boy whose fresh,
cheerful face was crossed with just a hint

662
00:55:54,460 --> 00:56:01,339
of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence
was a source of torment. In the idiom of his

663
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:07,680
generation Roscoe did not consider the matter
"efficient." It seemed to him that his father,

664
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,030
in refusing to look sixty, had not behaved
like a "red-blooded he-man" - this was Roscoe's

665
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:20,000
favourite expression - but in a curious and
perverse manner. Indeed, to think about the

666
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,250
matter for as much as a half an hour drove
him to the edge of insanity. Roscoe believed

667
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:34,950
that "live wires" should keep young, but carrying
it out on such a scale was - was - was inefficient.

668
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,780
And there Roscoe rested.

669
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,770
Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown
old enough to play childish games with little

670
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:49,059
Benjamin under the supervision of the same
nurse. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten

671
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:54,490
on the same day, and Benjamin found that playing
with little strips of coloured paper, making

672
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:59,720
mats and chains and curious and beautiful
designs, was the most fascinating game in

673
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:06,059
the world. Once he was bad and had to stand
in the corner - then he cried - but for the

674
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:11,230
most part there were gay hours in the cheerful
room, with the sunlight coming in the windows

675
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:19,049
and Miss Bailey's kind hand resting for a
moment now and then in his tousled hair.

676
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:24,109
Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade
after a year, but Benjamin stayed on in the

677
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:29,619
kindergarten. He was very happy. Sometimes
when other tots talked about what they would

678
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:35,319
do when they grew up a shadow would cross
his little face as if in a dim, childish way

679
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:41,030
he realised that those were things in which
he was never to share.

680
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:47,210
The days flowed on in monotonous content.
He went back a third year to the kindergarten,

681
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:52,530
but he was too little now to understand what
the bright shining strips of paper were for.

682
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:57,480
He cried because the other boys were bigger
than he, and he was afraid of them. The teacher

683
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:04,299
talked to him, but though he tried to understand
he could not understand at all.

684
00:58:04,299 --> 00:58:09,690
He was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse,
Nana, in her starched gingham dress, became

685
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:15,060
the centre of his tiny world. On bright days
they walked in the park; Nana would point

686
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:20,990
at a great gray monster and say "elephant,"
and Benjamin would say it after her, and when

687
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:27,020
he was being undressed for bed that night
he would say it over and over aloud to her:

688
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:34,069
"Elyphant, elyphant, elyphant." Sometimes
Nana let him jump on the bed, which was fun,

689
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:38,530
because if you sat down exactly right it would
bounce you up on your feet again, and if you

690
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:45,700
said "Ah" for a long time while you jumped
you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.

691
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:50,549
He loved to take a big cane from the hat - rack
and go around hitting chairs and tables with

692
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:56,680
it and saying: "Fight, fight, fight." When
there were people there the old ladies would

693
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,650
cluck at him, which interested him, and the
young ladies would try to kiss him, which

694
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:07,260
he submitted to with mild boredom. And when
the long day was done at five o'clock he would

695
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:15,849
go upstairs with Nana and be fed on oatmeal
and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon.

696
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:20,829
There were no troublesome memories in his
childish sleep; no token came to him of his

697
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:26,750
brave days at college, of the glittering years
when he flustered the hearts of many girls.

698
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:33,039
There were only the white, safe walls of his
crib and Nana and a man who came to see him

699
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,359
sometimes, and a great big orange ball that
Nana pointed at just before his twilight bed

700
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:46,099
hour and called "sun." When the sun went his
eyes were sleepy - there were no dreams, no

701
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:48,339
dreams to haunt him.

702
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:54,060
The past - the wild charge at the head of
his men up San Juan Hill; the first years

703
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,680
of his marriage when he worked late into the
summer dusk down in the busy city for young

704
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:04,220
Hildegarde whom he loved; the days before
that when he sat smoking far into the night

705
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,970
in the gloomy old Button house on Monroe Street
with his grandfather - all these had faded

706
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:17,680
like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as
though they had never been. He did not remember.

707
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,950
He did not remember clearly whether the milk
was warm or cool at his last feeding or how

708
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:29,830
the days passed - there was only his crib
and Nana's familiar presence. And then he

709
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:37,410
remembered nothing. When he was hungry he
cried - that was all. Through the noons and

710
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:43,069
nights he breathed and over him there were
soft mumblings and murmurings that he scarcely

711
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:49,970
heard, and faintly differentiated smells,
and light and darkness.

712
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:56,771
Then it was all dark, and his white crib and
the dim faces that moved above him, and the

713
01:00:56,771 --> 01:01:02,329
warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether
from his mind.

714
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:02,890
- THE END -
