00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,790
CHAPTER ONE
It is Monday afternoon and Lisa is in her

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,570
bedroom, talking on the phone with her friend
Ellie.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,440
Lisa is holding an official-looking envelope
in her hand.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,430
"It is from the Young Reporters Association,"
Lisa tells her friend.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,500
"I wonder...

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,150
what is it about?"

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,920
"Go on then, what are you waiting for?" asks
Ellie.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,830
"Open it right away, I'm so excited!"

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:38,890
Lisa opens the letter and reads aloud:

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,620
Dear Liza,

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,010
We are very happy to inform you that the young
Reporters Association has randomly selected

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,590
you to participate in the 1st International
Photo Convention with your photographs.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,170
The convention will take place on 27-31July,
in Beijing.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,410
You will also have another six days for sightseeing
on a train-tour with Hu Tian, one of our Chinese

15
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,410
members.

16
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,930
The young Reporters Association will plan
and pay for the whole trip.

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,430
So, pack your bags, Lisa.

18
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,360
You are going to China!

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,470
Yiao Ming

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,170
General Secretary of the Young Reporters Association

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,790
"They want to send me to China!

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,070
I can't believe my luck!"

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,070
she exclaims.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,880
"I have never been to China before.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,940
What an interesting place to go!"

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,940
"Lisa!

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,619
That's great news!"

28
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:34,770
exclaims Ellie.

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,930
"I know!"

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,090
answers Lisa.

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,850
"I have never been to China, but it has always
been one of my dreams," she says.

32
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,079
"Yes, it's an amazing opportunity for you,"
says Ellie.

33
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,820
"And, when you get back, you could write a
report about your trip for the school on-line

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,120
newspaper.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
What do you think?"

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,159
"Oh, Ellie," laughs Lisa.

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,360
"OK.

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,270
You never seem to forget your position at
the paper, do you?"

39
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,560
"Well, I'm not the editor for nothing," the
girl laughs back.

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,950
"Let's hang up now," she adds.

41
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,250
"You have to do some research before the trip,
don't you think?"

42
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,190
"You're right," says Lisa.

43
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,560
"China, here I come!"

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,050
CHAPTER TWO
After a long flight, Lisa finally arrives

45
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,050
in Beijing.

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,110
At the airport, a young man is waiting for
her.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,070
He is holding a sign reading "Lisa, YRA."

48
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,970
Lisa goes towards him and the man greets her
warmly.

49
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,500
"Nice to meet you, Lisa," he says and introduces
himself.

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,820
"I am Hu Tian and I work for a local teen
magazine here in Beijing.

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,510
I will be your guide in China!" he says as
he takes her suitcase.

52
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,420
Lisa is relieved.

53
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,500
Everything is so strange to her here and there
are so many people everywhere!

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,640
Hu Tian takes Lisa to her hotel by taxi.

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,020
"You must be tired after your long trip,"
he says when they arrive.

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,850
"Have some rest, and we'll meet again in the
afternoon.

57
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,570
Then, you can have a taste of China."

58
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,760
Lisa smiles as she goes to her hotel room.

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,210
"I wonder what he meant," she thinks to herself.

60
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,530
"Oh, well...

61
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,630
I guess I'll find out in a few hours," she
says and falls asleep right away.

62
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,810
After her nap, Lisa feels like a new person.

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,310
She meets up with Hu Tian and his sister,
Mei.

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,870
The two take her to a restaurant in the Old
City.

65
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,810
"So that's what you meant with 'a taste of
China!'

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,510
Lisa exclaims.

67
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,620
"Yes," smiles Hu Tian.

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,340
"You're going to enjoy a traditional Beijing
dinner."

69
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,880
Lisa remembers the delicious Chinese food
in New York and is excited to try some authentic

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,120
Chinese cuisine.

71
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,650
Maybe it will be even tastier.

72
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,330
At the restaurant, Lisa sees a round piece
of glass in the centre of the table.

73
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,530
"I know!"

74
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,730
shouts Lisa.

75
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,440
"It's a rotating tray!

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,760
The waiter puts all of the dishes on the tray
so that the people at the table can turn it

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,940
and try each of the different kinds of food,"
she says with a smile.

78
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,560
"It is customary to try a little bit of everything.

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,540
It is also polite to always leave the last
bite on the plate," says Mei.

80
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,130
When the waiter comes to the table, they order
traditional tea and several different dishes.

81
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,380
"We ordered Peking Duck, it's a famous dish
here," explains Mei.

82
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,310
The cook then brings the roast duck and cuts
it in front of them.

83
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,120
A waiter also brings different dishes to eat
along with the duck.

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,420
Lisa is impressed.

85
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,420
"What are all these little bowls?"

86
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,470
asks Lisa.

87
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,890
"There are pancakes in this one and vegetables
and three different kinds of sauces."

88
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,260
Hu Tian and Mei laugh.

89
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,060
"Let me show you how to eat Peking Duck" says
Mei.

90
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,080
"First, you take a pancake.

91
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,940
Then, you put some sauce and some vegetables
on your pancake."

92
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,330
"Ok, I got that," says Lisa.

93
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,830
"This is fun, actually."

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,970
"Now put some duck in the pancake and wrap
it.

95
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,570
Enjoy!" says Mei, smiling to the girl.

96
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,720
"Mmmm, delicious," says Lisa.

97
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,680
"No wonder it's so famous!"

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,960
They take turns turning the tray and tasting
the different kinds of food.

99
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,890
Hu Tian and Mei are eating with chopsticks.

100
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,260
"Is it difficult to eat with chopsticks?"

101
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,530
asks Lisa.

102
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,920
"No, not really," says Hu Tian and Mei offers
to teach her.

103
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,750
"I've never learnt so much at a dinner table
before!"

104
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,830
Lisa says with a giggle.

105
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,990
It is a fun evening of new experiences.

106
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,780
CHAPTER THREE
The next day is very busy.

107
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:36,050
Lisa spends almost all morning at the Photo
Convention, presenting her work and talking

108
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,530
to lots of people.

109
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,690
Then, she and Hu Tian meet with Mei and they
go to Tiananmen Square.

110
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,150
"Wow, this square is huge!

111
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,940
It is much larger than any other square I
have ever been to!"

112
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,400
Lisa exclaims.

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,500
"This, my dear, is the largest city square
in the world!"

114
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,919
boasts Hu Tian.

115
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,110
"One million people can fit here!"

116
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,900
"And who's that in the picture over there?"
asks Lisa.

117
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:14,510
"It's Mao Zedong, the founder of the People's
Republic of China," explains Hu Tian.

118
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:21,720
Next, the three friends take a tour of the
Forbidden City.

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,919
Lisa is impressed by the artwork and history
she discovers there.

120
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,760
"The Forbidden City is about 600 years old.

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,120
It used to be the Chinese Emperor's palace.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,360
You see, in Chinese history there were no
kings or queens, we had emperors and empresses.

123
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,199
Now the place is a huge museum, 'The Palace
Museum.'

124
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,730
Common people could not enter the Forbidden
City; that is why they called it Forbidden,"

125
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,139
says Hu Tian.

126
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,389
Lisa and her friends are now in The Hall of
Supreme Harmony.

127
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,830
"The Emperor's throne is here," says Mei.

128
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,949
Lisa looks around.

129
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,800
There are dragons everywhere.

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,050
Lisa is impressed and asks Mei about it.

131
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,510
"The dragon is a symbol of power, strength
and good luck," Mei explains.

132
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,770
"It was also the symbol of the Emperor himself."

133
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:27,300
"In the Hall of Supreme Harmony, experts counted
13,844 dragons!"

134
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,600
adds Hu Tian.

135
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,870
As they walk towards the exit, Lisa hears
Hu Tian's voice.

136
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,190
"Come on, Lisa," Hu Tian shouts.

137
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,130
"I'm hungry.

138
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,400
Let's have some lunch!"

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,830
"That sounds great!"

140
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,830
Lisa replies.

141
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,880
"Where shall we eat?"

142
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,510
she asks as they walk towards the exit.

143
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,910
"I know!

144
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,950
Let's have a picnic near Tiananmen Square.

145
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,650
We can buy some sandwiches over there," Hu
Tian suggests, pointing to a shop across the

146
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,910
street.

147
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,350
They sit down on a bench and have a lovely
picnic in the warm sun.

148
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,810
Lisa is admiring a very large, modern building
across the street.

149
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,060
"That is a beautiful building," says Lisa.

150
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,480
"It looks like a giant egg, doesn't it?"

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,740
"You're right, Lisa," says Mei.

152
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,880
"It is the National Center for the Performing
Arts, but the local people just call it 'The

153
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Egg.'

154
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,070
Concerts, operas and plays take place there."

155
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,330
After lunch, they go to the Olympic Green,
the most modern part of Beijing.

156
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,550
"Wow!

157
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,510
Look at all those buildings!"

158
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,660
Lisa exclaims.

159
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,410
"That one looks like an ice cube."

160
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,710
"Yes, it's a very interesting building.

161
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,190
That's the National Aquatics Center.

162
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,830
It housed the swimming and diving competitions
of the Summer Olympic Games in 2008," replies

163
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,830
Hu Tian.

164
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:05,550
"See that one over there?" says Mei, pointing
at a very strange structure, "That's the National

165
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,110
Stadium, the Bird's Nest.

166
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,260
Can you see why?"

167
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,140
"Of course, it's like a gigantic bird's nest!"

168
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,390
Lisa replies.

169
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:26,260
"China has certainly changed a lot since the
times of the emperors in the Forbidden City!"

170
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,920
CHAPTER FOUR
For Lisa's last day in Beijing, Hu Tian and

171
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Mei have a special surprise for her.

172
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,880
They decide to take their friend on a short
trip.

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,070
"Where are we going?" asks Lisa at the bus
station.

174
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,880
"We can't tell you.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,390
It's a surprise," says Hu Tian with a grin.

176
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,080
"Yes, you'll see when we get there," says
Mei with a giggle.

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,340
"Now, let's get on the bus."

178
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,930
The scenery changes outside the bus window.

179
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,790
The tall skyscrapers and cars of the city
soon give way to smaller buildings and fewer

180
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,470
cars, until there are only endless golden
fields.

181
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,010
"Where we are going?"

182
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,490
Lisa wonders.

183
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,170
Then, she looks outside the window and suddenly
realises.

184
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,320
"Wow!

185
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,590
The Great Wall of China!

186
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,270
One of the greatest wonders of the world!"

187
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,270
she exclaims.

188
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,610
"How long is it, anyway?"

189
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,279
she asks her friends.

190
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:43,770
"The Great Wall of China is 8,851.8 km or
5,500 miles long," Hu Tian says proudly.

191
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,930
"And it's more than 2,000 years old!" he continues.

192
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:56,870
"The Emperor Qin Shihuang of the Qin Dynasty
started the Wall around 221BC," adds Mei.

193
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,940
"But work continued during the Han and until
the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century," she

194
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
says.

195
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,839
"Thousands, if not millions, of people worked
day and night to finish the Wall."

196
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:17,860
"It's very impressive," says Lisa as the three
walk to the closest part of the Great Wall.

197
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,550
It is on a steep hill.

198
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:27,100
"This is a beautiful walk, but it is harder
than it looks," Lisa says, stopping to catch

199
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,270
her breath.

200
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,550
"Don't worry," Hu Tian replies.

201
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,850
"You will be able to relax later."

202
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,660
"What do you mean?"

203
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
she asks.

204
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,339
"It's another surprise," Hu Tian says, smiling.

205
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,580
"A whole day of surprises!

206
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,660
This is so much fun!

207
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,850
You two are great!"

208
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,089
Lisa says as she takes photos of her new friends
and the Great Wall.

209
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,149
"Now say 'cheese'!"

210
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,080
A little later, Hu Tian and Mei look at Lisa
and smile.

211
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,459
"It is time to show you a different China,"
says Hu Tian.

212
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:09,520
"I have no idea what you're talking about,
but I'm sure it's going to be another great

213
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:19,320
experience," Lisa says, smiling back.

214
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,410
Another bus takes them beyond the fields until
they reach a small farming village.

215
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,279
They get off and see an elderly man and woman.

216
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,230
"Ni hao," they greet the three friends in
Chinese.

217
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,480
"Hello," says Lisa and then turns to Hu Tian
and Mei.

218
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,870
"They are our aunt and uncle," says Mei.

219
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,490
"They don't speak English but they are very
friendly."

220
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:53,120
Then they all walk down a small road with
gates and walls on all sides.

221
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,990
They enter one of the gateways.

222
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,350
"This is our aunt and uncle's house.

223
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,260
It is very traditional," says Mei.

224
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,760
Next, they all sit down and have tea together.

225
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,790
"Tea is very important in Chinese culture,"
explains Mei.

226
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,640
"Chinese people drink a lot of tea, and we
also celebrate a number of occasions with

227
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,890
tea ceremonies."

228
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,760
"Oh, good," smiles Lisa.

229
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,700
"I love tea, it's my favourite drink!"

230
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,580
On their way back a few hours later, Lisa
remarks: "It was so exciting to see what life

231
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,480
is like for people in the countryside.

232
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,589
It is very different from the busy Beijing
life."

233
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:45,050
"Well, a lot of Chinese still live in villages
like that, not cities," explains Hu Tian.

234
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,800
"What do you think of life in the village?"

235
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,330
"Hmm... the village is quieter and the countryside
around it is very beautiful.

236
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:59,171
However, there is more technology in the city
and more things to do than in the village,"

237
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,480
says Lisa thoughtfully.

238
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:11,480
"I guess that city life and village life are
both nice, but in different ways."

239
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,760
CHAPTER FIVE
The next stop on Lisa's trip is even more

240
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,840
interesting.

241
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,170
After getting a good night's sleep on the
train from Beijing to Xi'an, Lisa, Mei and

242
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,240
Hu Tian go to see the Terracotta Army.

243
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,190
They take a guided tour of the ancient site.

244
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,940
"The Terracotta Soldiers' purpose was to protect
Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China,

245
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,560
after his death.

246
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,930
His tomb has about eight thousand clay soldiers
surrounding it.

247
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,690
It is a truly amazing sight," says the guide.

248
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,660
"I've seen nothing like this before," whispers
Lisa into Mei's ear.

249
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,220
"They look alike, but they are all different."

250
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,529
"Each soldier's face is unique," the guide
continues.

251
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:07,400
"The soldiers are as tall as real people and
they had swords, knives, crossbows and other

252
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,779
weapons.

253
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:13,210
Surprisingly, all these were as sharp as new!

254
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,709
According to their roles, the height of the
soldiers varies; the tallest are the generals

255
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:27,680
and you'll also find officials, warriors,
chariots, horses, even acrobats and musicians.

256
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,820
Some of them have missing parts and others
are still in the dirt.

257
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,340
However, some of the soldiers are in Very
good shape and seem new, as you can see,"

258
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
says the guide.

259
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:44,790
"I wonder how many people had to work to make
this army," Lisa whispers, and the guide hears

260
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,790
her.

261
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:52,700
"According to Sima Qian, an ancient historian,
more than 700,000 workers worked on the emperor's

262
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,880
tomb for about 38 years," he explains.

263
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
"Wow!

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
Amazing!"

265
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,140
exclaims Lisa.

266
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,070
"But where is the tomb?"

267
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,069
"Ah, the tomb is still a mystery," adds the
guide.

268
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:10,720
"Archaeologists have found the tomb, but they
have not opened it yet."

269
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
"No?

270
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,499
Why not?" asks Lisa.

271
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:17,980
"Surely, there will be lots of treasures inside!"

272
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,049
"Well," says the man, "that's what Sima Qian's
book says.

273
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:28,549
But archaeologists are worried that they might
damage the valuable objects inside the tomb."

274
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,590
"I see," says Lisa.

275
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,140
"There is something else too," adds Hu Tian.

276
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,530
"There are traps inside the tomb.

277
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,470
Dangerous traps, to prevent tomb raiders from
stealing the treasures inside.

278
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,350
At least, that's what the legend says..."

279
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,259
"Oh, it's such an interesting story!

280
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,489
I guess we'll have to wait and see!"

281
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:52,659
Lisa smiles.

282
00:17:52,659 --> 00:18:02,720
"With or without the treasures from the Emperor's
tomb, this place is fantastic!"

283
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,730
CHAPTER SIX
The next day, Lisa, Mei and Hu Tian go to

284
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,840
Shanghai on another overnight train.

285
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,649
The first place to visit is an area called
the Bund.

286
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:24,720
It's a lively place by the Huangpu River,
full of beautiful historical buildings.

287
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,240
They walk down a street called Nanjing Road,
the main street of the Bund, and have lunch

288
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,510
at a restaurant.

289
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,919
Lisa tries Shanghai crispy chicken and she
finds it delicious.

290
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,240
"I'm really getting used to using chopsticks.

291
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,399
It's actually a lot of fun!"

292
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:47,720
Lisa says, excitedly.

293
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,970
After lunch, they walk a few blocks to the
Yu Garden, in Shanghai's Old City.

294
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,859
It is a traditional Chinese garden with beautiful,
old buildings called pagodas.

295
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:06,940
It is very large and they take their time
exploring it.

296
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,309
There are various trees and rocks and small
ponds with bridges.

297
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,139
Ducks and fish are swimming in the water and
there are dragons on the walls.

298
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:21,019
"The trees, plants and flowers are so pretty!

299
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,539
And it's so peaceful here!"

300
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,559
Lisa admires.

301
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,899
"It is the perfect place to walk around, it
makes you feel you are at one with nature."

302
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:36,850
"Well, that is exactly what the Chinese garden
is about," says Mei.

303
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:43,149
"Here one can escape from the busy daily routine
and have some time to themselves."

304
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:49,220
After a pleasant walk through the Yu Garden,
Mei and Hu Tian take Lisa to the Yu Market

305
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,899
right outside.

306
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:57,570
"The Yu Market is so noisy and busy with people!"

307
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,770
Lisa exclaims.

308
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,419
"It suddenly feels like we're in a different
city."

309
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,509
"Of course it's noisy," says Mei.

310
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,340
"Shanghai has the largest population in China."

311
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:16,279
Lisa has fun choosing a few traditional gifts:
a pearl necklace for her mother, chopsticks

312
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,549
for all her family and a beautiful silk dress
for herself.

313
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,700
Then she asks Mei: "I want to get something
special for my friend, Ellie.

314
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
What do you suggest?"

315
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,759
Mei points to some Chinese silk scarves.

316
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,440
"How about one of those?

317
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
Chinese silk is famous worldwide!"

318
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
"Great, Ellie will love it!"

319
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:49,239
Lisa says enthusiastically as she buys the
scarf.

320
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:54,570
CHAPTER SEVEN
When Lisa wakes up the next day, she looks

321
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,779
out of the window and sees that it is raining.

322
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,789
"Oh no!" says Lisa, disappointed.

323
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:03,980
"What are we going to do now?

324
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,649
We can't see much of Shanghai in the rain."

325
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:11,950
"Don't worry, Lisa," Hu Tian says, "We can
still see a lot today.

326
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,539
We just need to go above the rain."

327
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:19,009
"I don't know what you mean by that, but I'm
happy to follow you on another surprise tour,"

328
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,080
says Lisa.

329
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,600
First, they take Lisa to the Shanghai World
Financial Centre.

330
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,830
It's a 492 metres tall building with 101 floors!

331
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,289
"We'll go to the third observation deck on
the 100th floor," says Hu Tian.

332
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,679
"I hope you're not afraid of heights!"

333
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:45,710
"No, of course not," says Lisa and smiles
as she remembers her New York experience.

334
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,019
Once they get to the observation deck, Lisa
takes a look around and says, "It is fantastic

335
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,169
up here!

336
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,970
We are even higher than the clouds.

337
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,270
We really are above the rain."

338
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:06,639
"We are 474 metres, 1,555 feet above the ground,"
explains Mei.

339
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:09,470
"Have a look at the view, it's amazing!"

340
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,669
"What's that building over there?

341
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:15,909
It's very interesting," Lisa points out of
the window.

342
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,840
"That's the Oriental Pearl TV Tower.

343
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,230
We're going to visit it next," says Hu Tian.

344
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,159
When they arrive at the Oriental Pearl TV
Tower they visit the rotating restaurant.

345
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,899
It stands 267 meters, or 876 feet, above Shanghai.

346
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,149
"This place is great!

347
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:47,419
Hey look, I can see the SWFC from here!" says
Lisa, looking out of the large windows.

348
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,600
"The rain stopped," says Mei.

349
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,509
Suddenly, a rainbow appears in the sky.

350
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:56,509
"Wow!"

351
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,509
admires Lisa.

352
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,570
"How wonderful!"

353
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:06,779
She has a great day in the Shanghai sky.

354
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,210
CHAPTER EIGHT
After taking the last train ride of their

355
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,119
trip, Lisa, Hu Tian and Mei arrive in Hong
Kong.

356
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:22,360
"I can already tell that Hong Kong is different
from any of the other places we've been to.

357
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,619
The cars are driving on the left side of the
road," Lisa says, during their taxi ride to

358
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,619
the hotel.

359
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,230
"That's not the only difference," Mei tells
Lisa.

360
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,440
"The people here speak Cantonese.

361
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,240
It is different from Mandarin Chinese, but
they also have much in common."

362
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,889
"Tell me some more about Hong Kong," asks
Lisa.

363
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,220
"I don't really know much."

364
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,869
"Well, it is one of the most populated places
in the world, with an amazing culture.

365
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:53,679
Hong Kong's landscape is also unique.

366
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,370
There are hills and tall mountains, parks
and nature reserves, and there are about 200

367
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,700
offshore islands.

368
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,249
Visitors have a lot to do here.

369
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:05,429
Just wait and see!"

370
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,710
Mei says.

371
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:14,200
After leaving their luggage in their hotel
rooms, they head to the Peak Tram.

372
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:21,570
It takes them up to The Peak, the top of one
of the nearby mountains, 396 metres above

373
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,309
sea level.

374
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,739
The view from the top of the Peak Tower is
breathtaking.

375
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:31,609
"Hong Kong's skyline is very impressive, as
you can see.

376
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:38,610
There are more than 7, 600 skyscrapers, but
that's not what makes the place so special,"

377
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,919
Mei says.

378
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,919
"Yes.

379
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,989
It is a great mixture of amazing buildings
and beautiful landscape.

380
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:47,700
The view is fantastic from up here!"

381
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,600
replies Lisa, enthusiastically.

382
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,489
"Let me take your photo, the light is wonderful
right now," she tells her friends as she reaches

383
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,460
in her pocket for her camera.

384
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:09,299
"This picture will be suitable for the next
Photo Convention," she says and smiles.

385
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:15,270
CHAPTER NINE
Lisa looks out of her window at the Hong Kong

386
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,330
skyline.

387
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,929
The place looks magical at night, with millions
of lights shining.

388
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:26,010
"It's my last night in China," Lisa keeps
thinking.

389
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,019
She feels a bit sad about it, but she is also
a little homesick.

390
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:36,620
"I'm sure tomorrow will be a day to remember,"
she thinks and goes to sleep.

391
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:44,150
The next morning, the three young people go
to a place called Aberdeen, on a nearby island.

392
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:49,399
On the way there, they pass by a park in Kowloon
City.

393
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:55,940
Lisa notices a large group of people who are
all standing in the park, in strange positions.

394
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,929
"What are they doing?" she asks curiously.

395
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:06,070
"They're practising Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese
martial art," explains Hu Tian.

396
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,070
"Really?

397
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,299
Can we get off of the bus and watch for a
while?"

398
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,409
Lisa asks.

399
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:16,259
"Of course," replies Mei.

400
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:24,460
"People who practise Tai Chi do a series of
warrior movements very slowly, concentrating

401
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,070
on their bodies.

402
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,609
It helps them stay healthy," Hu Tian tells
Lisa.

403
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:32,340
"How interesting!"

404
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
Lisa says.

405
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,940
"Would you like to try?" asks a woman.

406
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,029
"The class is free, and it's only an hour
long."

407
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,389
Lisa is thrilled.

408
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:46,009
"Mei, can you take some pictures of me practising?

409
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:53,099
I want to show them to Ellie when I get back."

410
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:57,090
Next Lisa and her friends take the bus to
Ocean Park in Aberdeen.

411
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:02,210
"It's a huge place with lots of attractions,"
explains Mei.

412
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,889
"We're going to take you to see the giant
pandas."

413
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,399
"Wow!

414
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:14,960
They're so big!"

415
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,370
exclaims Lisa when she sees the animals in
the Giant Panda Habitat.

416
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,380
"But they're cute!"

417
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,399
"Pandas are in great danger; only 1,000 to
3,000 remain in the wild," says Hu Tian.

418
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,200
"How about a visit to Aqua City next?" asks
Mei.

419
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,510
"That sounds great," Lisa agrees.

420
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,539
She's right.

421
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:48,389
Thousands of colourful fish and other sea
animals, make their visit unforgettable.

422
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:50,499
Lisa keeps taking pictures.

423
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:56,669
"It will make a great article for the school
newspaper," she thinks to herself.

424
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:05,279
"Ellie will be thrilled."

425
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,119
CHAPTER TEN
The three of them are tired, but their visit

426
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,140
to Aberdeen hasn't finished yet.

427
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,480
Hu Tian and Mei take Lisa to the famous floating
village on Aberdeen harbour.

428
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,330
They call it 'floating' because it is a village
of boats.

429
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,049
"This is incredible!

430
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:31,940
There are so many boats that I can't even
see the water," exclaims Lisa.

431
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,759
"All these people live on their boats; their
lives depend on fishing and the sea.

432
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:43,570
The 'boat people' of Hong Kong have lived
this way for centuries," Mei explains.

433
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:50,070
"Now," smiles Hu Tian, "since it is our last
dinner together, it must be special."

434
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,629
So, they go to the Jumbo Kingdom, a famous
floating restaurant.

435
00:28:54,629 --> 00:29:00,409
"Give me a minute," says Lisa and disappears
for a while.

436
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:04,599
When she comes back, she's wearing her Chinese
red silk dress.

437
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:08,419
"I bought it for a special occasion," she
says.

438
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,869
"Well, it is a special occasion."

439
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:16,359
Mei gives her a big hug and they sit down
to enjoy their dinner.

440
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:25,659
The lights of the floating village make the
place look magical.

441
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:31,830
The next day, the time has come for Lisa to
say goodbye to her Chinese friends and board

442
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,389
the plane back home.

443
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:38,359
"I am sad to leave, but I will come back to
China some day.

444
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,029
Now I have an extra reason...

445
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,960
I have good friends to visit here," she says
to Hu Tian and Mei, with a smile.

446
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,080
"We must stay in touch.

447
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Promise?"

448
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,190
asks Mei.

449
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:56,940
"I promise," says Lisa, "And you must come
and visit me some day, too!"

450
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,080
As she sits down in her seat, she thinks about
her visit to China.

451
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,179
The people, the food, the sights...

452
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,259
everything was incredible!

453
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,320
"Well," she thinks and a big smile appears
on her face.

454
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
"I wouldn't trade this experience for all
the tea in China!"

455
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,389
- THE END -
