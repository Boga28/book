But both of them are moving all the time, and don t change position to each other. It is thanks to the moon that humanity received four seasons, which change each other in turn. And thanks to it, the planet does not become so hot or cold that it was uncomfortable to be on it. The atmosphere of the Moon pulls over water in the seas and oceans, thanks to its gravitation.

They examined the beautiful old architecture of this place and took many photographs. Pam had a good camera. She liked taking pictures in her free time. Sometimes she managed to take very good pictures. Still, most of her photos were not so good. Then Martin would laugh at them. Around five in the evening, the brother and the sister wanted to go home. The day was long and they felt tired. Pam offered to take a picture of Martin again. He was jokingly horrified. Suddenly, a man with a large backpack got captured by the camera. Pam was upset, as the photo was spoiled. She did not know yet that this failure would be the beginning of a real adventure.",

He loved his country and spent time on the plains, in many cozy valleys and loved walking at cold nights. But soon the war began. World War II overtook Europe. The man was preparing to become a pilot. Once he took a plane and flew to watch wild animals during maneuvering exercises in the sky. He damaged the wing of the plane, but was able to return to the airport. Soon he was again entrusted with the aircraft. But the next time the pilot was unlucky - the aircraft`s engine died out and he had to make an emergency landing. This time it was without damage. He saw a small hut and went to her. There lived an old man who grew food. He warmly welcomed the pilot and allowed him to live in his hut.",

But wild animals eat too. People are different from them with their food culture. National cuisine, lots of interesting festive dishes in each country. Humanity has learned to cook interesting dishes throughout all its history. If in ancient times it was meat roasted on fire, then today everything is limited only by the imagination of the cook. And Chinese, Japanese, Italian and many other national cuisines are known in the whole world. Sushi and pizza have ceased to be food of a certain country and have become one of the most popular world dishes.",

The taxi driver was sorry for his passenger: the lady was not young, but she was still far from old age, with a beautiful face and dark hair. While he was closing the windows and turning on the air conditioner, he thought that many men would have decided that she was very attractive. He said that in the place they were going to there were no sewer lines and the lady had no need to worry.",
