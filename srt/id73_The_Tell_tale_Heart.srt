1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,630
The Tell-Tale Heart

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,630
True!

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,530
Nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had
been and am; but why will you say that I am

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,530
mad?

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,070
The disease had sharpened my senses, not destroyed,
not dulled them.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,570
Above all was the sense of hearing acute.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,099
I heard all things in the heaven and in the
earth.

8
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:24,520
I heard many things in hell.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,099
How then am I mad?

10
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:29,099
Hearken!

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:38,000
And observe how healthily, how calmly, I can
tell you the whole story.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,600
It is impossible to say how first the idea
entered my brain, but, once conceived, it

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
haunted me day and night.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,110
Object there was none.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,760
Passion there was none.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,060
I loved the old man.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,600
He had never wronged me.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,330
He had never given me insult.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,210
For his gold I had no desire.

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,790
I think it was his eye!

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,110
Yes, it was this!

22
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,900
One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture
- a pale blue eye with a film over it.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,820
Whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold,
and so by degrees, very gradually, I made

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,130
up my mind to take the life of the old man,
and thus rid myself of the eye for ever.

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,130
Now this is the point.

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,130
You fancy me mad.

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,130
Madmen know nothing.

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,130
But you should have seen me.

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,600
You should have seen how wisely I proceeded
- with what caution - with what foresight,

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,049
with what dissimulation, I went to work!

31
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,899
I was never kinder to the old man than during
the whole week before I killed him.

32
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:44,469
And every night about midnight I turned the
latch of his door and opened it oh, so gently!

33
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:50,229
And then, when I had made an opening sufficient
for my head, I put in a dark lantern all closed,

34
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:55,130
closed so that no light shone out, and then
I thrust in my head.

35
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,320
Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly
I thrust it in!

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:09,020
I moved it slowly, very, very slowly, so that
I might not disturb the old man's sleep.

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,850
It took me an hour to place my whole head
within the opening so far that I could see

38
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,440
him as he lay upon his bed.

39
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Ha!

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,300
Would a madman have been so wise as this?

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,660
And then when my head was well in the room
I undid the lantern cautiously - oh, so cautiously

42
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:36,530
- cautiously (for the hinges creaked), I undid
it just so much that a single thin ray fell

43
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,730
upon the vulture eye.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:47,470
And this I did for seven long nights, every
night just at midnight, but I found the eye

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,330
always closed, and so it was impossible to
do the work, for it was not the old man who

46
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,860
vexed me but his Evil Eye.

47
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,860
And every morning, when the day broke, I went
boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously

48
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,860
to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone,
and inquiring how he had passed the night.

49
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
So you see he would have been a very profound
old man, indeed , to suspect that every night,

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,860
just at twelve, I looked in upon him while
he slept.

51
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,720
Upon the eighth night I was more than usually
cautious in opening the door.

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,600
A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than
did mine.

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Never before that night had I felt the extent
of my own powers, of my sagacity.

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,870
To think that there I was opening the door
little by little, and he not even to dream

56
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,040
of my secret deeds or thoughts.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:27,120
I fairly chuckled at the idea, and perhaps
he heard me, for he moved on the bed suddenly

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
as if startled.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,140
Now you may think that I drew back - but no.

60
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,530
His room was as black as pitch with the thick
darkness (for the shutters were close fastened

61
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,890
through fear of robbers), and so I knew that
he could not see the opening of the door,

62
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,070
and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.

63
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,190
I had my head in, and was about to open the
lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin

64
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,910
fastening , and the old man sprang up in the
bed, crying out, "Who's there?"

65
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,120
I kept quite still and said nothing.

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,010
For a whole hour I did not move a muscle,
and in the meantime I did not hear him lie

67
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,010
down.

68
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:14,290
He was still sitting up in the bed, listening;
just as I have done night after night hearkening

69
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,280
to the death watches in the wall.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,161
Presently, I heard a slight groan, and I knew
it was the groan of mortal terror.

71
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,161
It was not a groan of pain or of grief - oh,
no!

72
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,161
It was the low stifled sound that arises from
the bottom of the soul when overcharged with

73
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:26,161
awe.

74
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,161
I knew the sound well.

75
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,161
Many a night, just at midnight, when all the
world slept, it has welled up from my own

76
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,161
bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo,
the terrors that distracted me.

77
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,161
I say I knew it well.

78
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,161
I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him
although I chuckled at heart.

79
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,161
I knew that he had been lying awake ever since
the first slight noise when he had turned

80
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,161
in the bed.

81
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,161
His fears had been ever since growing upon
him.

82
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,161
He had been trying to fancy them causeless,
but could not.

83
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:39,290
He had been saying to himself, "It is nothing
but the wind in the chimney, it is only a

84
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,520
mouse crossing the floor," or, "It is merely
a cricket which has made a single chirp."

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,240
Yes he has been trying to comfort himself
with these suppositions ; but he had found

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,150
all in vain.

87
00:04:52,150 --> 00:05:00,370
ALL IN VAIN, because Death in approaching
him had stalked with his black shadow before

88
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,190
him and enveloped the victim.

89
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,669
And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived
shadow that caused him to feel, although he

90
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,990
neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence
of my head within the room.

91
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,030
When I had waited a long time very patiently
without hearing him lie down, I resolved to

92
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,060
open a little - a very, very little crevice
in the lantern.

93
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:29,890
So I opened it - you cannot imagine how stealthily,
stealthily - until at length a single dim

94
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:37,080
ray like the thread of the spider shot out
from the crevice and fell upon the vulture

95
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,290
eye.

96
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:46,180
It was open, wide, wide open, and I grew furious
as I gazed upon it.

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:53,970
I saw it with perfect distinctness - all a
dull blue with a hideous veil over it that

98
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,030
chilled the very marrow in my bones, but I
could see nothing else of the old man's face

99
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,400
or person, for I had directed the ray as if
by instinct precisely upon the damned spot.

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,240
And now have I not told you that what you
mistake for madness is but over-acuteness

101
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,570
of the senses?

102
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:20,260
Now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull,
quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped

103
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,139
in cotton.

104
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,960
I knew that sound well too.

105
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,160
It was the beating of the old man's heart.

106
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,090
It increased my fury as the beating of a drum
stimulates the soldier into courage.

107
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,570
But even yet I refrained and kept still.

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,300
I scarcely breathed.

109
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,530
I held the lantern motionless.

110
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:55,990
I tried how steadily I could maintain the
ray upon the eye.

111
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,120
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased.

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,770
It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and
louder, every instant.

113
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,470
The old man's terror must have been extreme!

114
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,860
It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!

115
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,030
- do you mark me well?

116
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,760
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.

117
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,621
And now at the dead hour of the night, amid
the dreadful silence of that old house, so

118
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:21,690
strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable
terror.

119
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,430
Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and
stood still.

120
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,040
But the beating grew louder, louder!

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,820
I thought the heart must burst.

122
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,230
And now a new anxiety seized me - the sound
would be heard by a neighbour!

123
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,510
The old man's hour had come!

124
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,720
With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern
and leaped into the room.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,080
He shrieked once - once only.

126
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:55,229
In an instant I dragged him to the floor,
and pulled the heavy bed over him.

127
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:00,770
I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far
done.

128
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,210
But for many minutes the heart beat on with
a muffled sound.

129
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,060
This, however, did not vex me; it would not
be heard through the wall.

130
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,800
At length it ceased.

131
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,070
The old man was dead.

132
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,639
I removed the bed and examined the corpse.

133
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,250
Yes, he was stone, stone dead.

134
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,290
I placed my hand upon the heart and held it
there many minutes.

135
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,290
There was no pulsation.

136
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,290
He was stone dead.

137
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,320
His eye would trouble me no more.

138
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,130
If still you think me mad, you will think
so no longer when I describe the wise precautions

139
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,860
I took for the concealment of the body.

140
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:49,540
The night waned, and I worked hastily, but
in silence.

141
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,890
I took up three planks from the flooring of
the chamber, and deposited all between the

142
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,890
scantlings.

143
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,710
I then replaced the boards so cleverly so
cunningly, that no human eye - not even his

144
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,930
- could have detected anything wrong.

145
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,080
There was nothing to wash out - no stain of
any kind - no blood-spot whatever.

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,490
I had been too wary for that.

147
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:19,940
When I had made an end of these labours, it
was four o'clock - still dark as midnight.

148
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:27,110
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a
knocking at the street door.

149
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,130
I went down to open it with a light heart,
- for what had I now to fear?

150
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:39,010
There entered three men, who introduced themselves,
with perfect suavity, as officers of the police.

151
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,240
A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during
the night; suspicion of foul play had been

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,240
aroused; information had been lodged at the
police office, and they (the officers) had

153
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,990
been deputed to search the premises.

154
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,020
I smiled, - for what had I to fear?

155
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,790
I bade the gentlemen welcome.

156
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,330
The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream.

157
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,150
The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the
country.

158
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,550
I took my visitors all over the house.

159
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,730
I bade them search - search well.

160
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,750
I led them, at length, to his chamber.

161
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,610
I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.

162
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,880
In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought
chairs into the room, and desired them here

163
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:30,020
to rest from their fatigues, while I myself,
in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph,

164
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:38,649
placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath
which reposed the corpse of the victim.

165
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:41,010
The officers were satisfied.

166
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,060
My MANNER had convinced them.

167
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,790
I was singularly at ease.

168
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,740
They sat and while I answered cheerily, they
chatted of familiar things.

169
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,959
But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale
and wished them gone.

170
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,680
My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in
my ears; but still they sat, and still chatted.

171
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,880
The ringing became more distinct: I talked
more freely to get rid of the feeling: but

172
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:20,589
it continued and gained definitiveness - until,
at length, I found that the noise was NOT

173
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:22,660
within my ears.

174
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:30,500
No doubt I now grew VERY pale; but I talked
more fluently, and with a heightened voice.

175
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,270
Yet the sound increased - and what could I
do?

176
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:40,031
It was A LOW, DULL, QUICK SOUND - MUCH SUCH
A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN

177
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,970
COTTON.

178
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,680
I gasped for breath, and yet the officers
heard it not.

179
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,560
I talked more quickly, more vehemently but
the noise steadily increased.

180
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,880
I arose and argued about trifles, in a high
key and with violent gesticulations; but the

181
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,839
noise steadily increased.

182
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,839
Why WOULD they not be gone?

183
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,450
I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides,
as if excited to fury by the observations

184
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,360
of the men, but the noise steadily increased.

185
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,550
O God!

186
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,450
What COULD I do?

187
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,550
I foamed - I raved - I swore!

188
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,440
I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting,
and grated it upon the boards, but the noise

189
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,740
arose over all and continually increased.

190
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,070
It grew louder - louder - louder!

191
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:44,230
And still the men chatted pleasantly, and
smiled.

192
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,140
Was it possible they heard not?

193
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,300
Almighty God!

194
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
- No, no?

195
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
They heard!

196
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
- They suspected!

197
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
- They KNEW!

198
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,280
- They were making a mockery of my horror!

199
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,710
- This I thought, and this I think.

200
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,649
But anything was better than this agony!

201
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,149
Anything was more tolerable than this derision!

202
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,060
I could bear those hypocritical smiles no
longer!

203
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,309
I felt that I must scream or die!

204
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,670
- And now - again - hark!

205
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,670
Louder!

206
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,670
Louder!

207
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,670
Louder!

208
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,670
LOUDER!

209
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,670
-

210
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,670
"Villains!"

211
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,670
I shrieked, "Dissemble no more!

212
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,449
I admit the deed!

213
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,800
- tear up the planks!

214
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
- Here, here!

215
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:41,149
- it is the beating of his hideous heart!"

216
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:58,369
- THE END -
