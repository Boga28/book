CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,700
Tug is Taken Away
DAY ONE - SUNDAY 7TH AUGUST

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,610
Tug was running. His legs ached, his feet
hurt, all his body was screaming at him to

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:19,000
stop running. But he didn't want to stop.
He wanted today's run to be better and faster

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,839
than ever before. Now he was nearly at the
end of his run, and his legs were burning,

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,439
but he still went on running. As he came round
the last street corner, he saw his own front

7
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:38,400
door, a hundred metres away. I mustn't stop
now! he thought. I promised myself I'd do

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,579
eight kilometres, and I will!

9
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,480
The church bells were ringing, and the blood
was beating in his ears. Suddenly it all seemed

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,750
easy, and his legs felt strong. I can do it!
he said happily to himself.

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:00,340
He reached the front door, and looked at his
watch. 36 minutes 20 seconds. At last! Eight

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:07,430
kilometres in less than 37 minutes! I've been
trying to do that for weeks!

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:16,020
He put his key in the door. Now he could have
a hot bath. His mother would get home later.

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,540
She had promised to cook him a special meal
- chicken and chips, and a chocolate cake.

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,620
He smiled as he pushed open the door.

16
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,939
Strange! The house was dark, too dark. And
there was something more... But he was too

17
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:37,810
tired to think. Suddenly there was an arm
round his neck and a hand over his face. He

18
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,259
fell, and everything went black.

19
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,060
DAY TWO - MONDAY 8TH AUGUST
Fifteen hours later and two hundred kilometres

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,719
away in Derbyshire, Jinny Slattery came out
of the farmhouse. In the moonlight she could

21
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,550
see the ridge of mountains called Ashdale
Great Edge. It stood, black and frightening,

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,420
against the sky, with the Castle Rock at its
southern end.

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,171
Jinny walked away from the farmhouse, and
took the narrow road up the hill. It was two

24
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:13,600
o'clock in the morning, and very quiet. When
she reached some trees, her father stepped

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,030
out and touched her arm.

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,400
'Oh!' she cried in surprise, and felt angry
with herself. He had told her to be quiet.

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,511
'Follow me,' Joe said, and went on up the
road. He walked quickly and silently, his

28
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:30,180
dog just behind him.

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,560
I must remember what he told me to do, Jinny
thought.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,780
I don't want to make a mistake!

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,871
Now they were high up on the moors. Further
along was an old cottage, which Mrs Hollins

32
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:50,400
used to rent to summer visitors. It was almost
hidden by trees. On the right was a gate into

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,849
a field, the field which they had chosen.

34
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:59,530
Jinny felt sick. She knew what would happen
next. Joe had already filled every hole in

35
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,060
the hedges round the field, so the gate was
the only way out. Now he was putting a net

36
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,150
over the gate.

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,761
Just then they heard a car driving up the
road.

38
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:17,980
'Where is it going?' asked Jinny. 'This road
only goes to the moors and Mrs Hollins' cottage.'

39
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,269
'Visitors,' said Joe softly, 'probably renting
the cottage. Keep quiet, they won't see us

40
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,560
in the dark.'

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,360
The car drove slowly past them and stopped
in front of the cottage. Jinny could hear

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,370
the voices of a man and a woman, and then
a strange noise. Were they pulling something

43
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,840
heavy into the house? She couldn't see what
was happening.

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,620
When it was quiet again, Joe said softly,
'Remember, Jinny. Remember everything I told

45
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,650
you,' and went silently into the field, followed
by his dog.

46
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,989
Jinny was shaking now, not from cold but from
fear and excitement. She knew that Joe and

47
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,849
the dog were moving slowly through the field.
She thought of the hare, lying asleep in the

48
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:09,860
grass. It would try to escape through the
gate. Then she must do what Joe had told her.

49
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:18,976
I can't! she thought. But she had to do it.
'If you want to eat meat, you must be able

50
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:23,620
to kill an animal,' Joe had said. 'Why should
other people do it for you?'

51
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,030
But in the end it almost seemed easy. The
hare tried to jump through the gate and was

52
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,080
caught in the net. Automatically Jinny hit
its neck hard, and the hare's warm dead body

53
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,090
fell at her feet. As she was looking at it,
Joe arrived. 'Good girl,' he said, and started

54
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,110
taking the net off the gate.

55
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,780
Just then a loud noise broke the silence.
It was the sound of hammering, and it came

56
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,140
from the cottage.

57
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:59,200
'What's that?' Jinny cried. But Joe didn't
stop what he was doing. 'Nothing to do with

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,110
us,' he replied. That was what he always said.
For him the Slattery family was much more

59
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,770
important than the outside world.

60
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,120
'But if someone hears,' said Jinny, 'they'll
come up here to see, and then the police will

61
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,280
catch us... stealing hares that don't belong
to us!'

62
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,050
'Don't worry,' said Joe calmly. 'From the
village you can't hear anything that happens

63
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,500
up here. We'll make sure that we get home
with the hare before anyone comes.'

64
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,990
They walked down the road to the farmhouse.
I'm not like Joe, thought Jinny. I always

65
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,360
want to know why things happen. And I want
to know what's happening in that cottage!

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,820
10.00 A.M.
Seven hours later, Tug woke up in the cottage.

67
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,840
The room was full of sunshine and very loud
music. Above him was a high window, with strong

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,140
bars across it, and blue sky outside.

69
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:01,560
It must be a dream. He wanted to wake up,
and find himself in his own bedroom. But the

70
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,590
dream did not go away.

71
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,130
Suddenly he noticed a woman at the door. She
was about thirty, and very thin, with long

72
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,930
legs, long brown hair and long fingers. But
her eyes were the most interesting thing about

73
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,840
her. They were large and yellow-brown, almost
golden.

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,280
She said something, but he couldn't hear her
because of the music. 'Sorry, I didn't hear

75
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
that,' he said.

76
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,070
'I said how are you feeling?' she shouted
angrily.

77
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:41,060
Tug tried to sit up. When he moved his head,
he felt sick. 'What happened?' he asked. 'I

78
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,820
don't remember this place.' He was sure he
had never been there before.

79
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,230
The woman sounded careless, unworried. 'You
fell... hit your head ... we had to carry

80
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,230
you upstairs...'

81
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:01,810
It was important, but he couldn't hear because
the music was so loud. 'It's too noisy! We

82
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,480
can't talk!' he shouted.

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,590
She didn't answer, but opened the bedroom
door and shouted to someone. The music was

84
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,050
louder through the open door. Tug couldn't
think, and his head was still hurting.

85
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,831
A man came into the room, with slow, unhurried
steps. He had a strangely white face, with

86
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:30,110
cold blue eyes and thick black hair. The woman
spoke quietly to him. Tug couldn't hear.

87
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:38,590
'Look,' said Tug. He wanted to sound as polite
as possible. 'I don't remember anything. Where

88
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:45,960
am I? And how did I get here? And who are
you? Please will you tell me what's happening?'

89
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,260
'Don't worry,' said the man coldly. 'You hit
your head and you've forgotten a few things.

90
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,930
That's all. You'll be fine after a rest.'

91
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:05,050
He turned to go, but Tug reached out for his
arm. 'Please!' he cried wildly. 'You must

92
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,730
tell me something!

93
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,880
'We're in the cottage that we've rented for
our holiday, in the north of England. You

94
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,440
remember? Now try and sleep.'

95
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,630
'But who are you?' shouted Tug. They were
both leaving the room. The man said something

96
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,860
that Tug didn't hear, ... mirror...' and closed
the door behind him. Tug jumped out of bed

97
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,170
and ran to the door, but it was locked.

98
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,750
Suddenly he felt very cold. The music still
filled his head, but it didn't stop him thinking

99
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,919
now. He had hoped this was all a mistake,
that they would answer his questions and explain

100
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,080
everything, or take him home. But now he realized
that they wanted to keep him a prisoner in

101
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
that room.

102
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,710
It was a small room just under the roof, with
only a bed and a cupboard in it. He looked

103
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,990
up at the window above his head. They had
hammered the bars on to it very recently.

104
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:09,010
He couldn't escape that way. He sat on the
bed and put his head in his hands. He had

105
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:15,580
never felt so miserable and frightened before.
Just then he thought of his mother. He knew

106
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,940
what she would say to him now. Why do you
always feel sorry for yourself? Get up and

107
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,430
do something! He felt better when he thought
of her small angry face. Cheer up, Tug! he

108
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,890
told himself, and got up to look in the cupboard.

109
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:39,081
He was very pleased to find his clothes there,
all ready for him to wear. But as he reached

110
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:45,770
for them, he noticed something. On the inside
of the door was a long mirror. What had the

111
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,269
man said? Something about a mirror. Slowly
Tug turned to look at himself.

112
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:58,310
And for a second he was in a bad dream. Because
the face in the mirror was not his. Then he

113
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,910
realized what was different - his hair. It
was black, not fair. His face seemed very

114
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,880
white, and his blue eyes looked coldly back
at him. He looked at himself in the mirror

115
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,640
for a long time. With the black hair, white
face and cold blue eyes, he looked just like

116
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,430
the man. He could almost be his son.

117
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,830
12.45 P.M.
Jinny ran into the village. Her father had

118
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,720
asked her to post something, so she wanted
to get to the post office before it closed

119
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,523
for lunch. Outside the post office she saw
Rachel Hollins sitting on a wall. Rachel's

120
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:41,410
father was the village policeman, and her
mother worked in the post office. Rachel was

121
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:50,410
very pretty, and always wore beautiful clothes.
'Hello Jinny!' she cried. 'Do you like my

122
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,520
new dress?'

123
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,480
'Very nice,' replied Jinny crossly. 'But I
couldn't wear that for working on the farm.'

124
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:10,042
'Oh, I forgot!' said Rachel. She smiled sweetly
- too sweetly, and Jinny wanted to hit her.

125
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,650
'I'm so sorry! Poor Jinny! You have to work
so hard and you never have any new clothes

126
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:18,530
and... She stopped as she saw someone behind
Jinny 'I must go in and have lunch,' she said

127
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,620
quickly, and ran inside.

128
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,460
Jinny turned to see who was behind her. It
was a woman, with the strangest, loveliest

129
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,160
eyes she had ever seen - big, yellow-brown
eyes, almost golden. Hares eyes, thought Jinny.

130
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,660
The woman looked like a hare, with her long
legs and thin face.

131
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,370
'I can see that girl only thinks about clothes,'
said the Hare-woman to Jinny, and walked into

132
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:51,790
the post office. Jinny watched her go. What
an interesting woman! she thought. And she

133
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,670
understands about Rachel!

134
00:11:53,670 --> 00:12:00,460
Inside the post office the one o'clock news
was on the radio. The Hare-woman, Mrs Hollins,

135
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,280
and Jinny all listened.

136
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,850
Terrorists are holding thirteen-year-old Liam
Shakespeare, Harriet Shakespeare's son, at

137
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,530
the family home in London. Police are trying
to...

138
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,660
'How terrible!' said Mrs Hollins. 'That poor
boy!'

139
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,870
'Who's Harriet Shakespeare?' asked Jinny.

140
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:28,860
'You haven't heard of her?' asked the Hare-woman
in surprise. 'She's a television reporter,

141
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,620
always looking for other people's secrets.
Thinks herself very important.'

142
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,740
Mrs Hollins pretended to feel sorry for Jinny.
'Poor girl, she doesn't have any newspapers

143
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,180
or radio or television in her house,' she
explained. 'Her family grow their own food,

144
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,740
make their own clothes. They never buy anything
new!'

145
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,260
Mrs Hollins always laughs at us Slatterys,
thought Jinny. 'We prefer to do everything

146
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,050
for ourselves,' she said. She really wanted
the stranger to understand.

147
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:09,750
But Mrs Hollins had started talking about
the news again. 'That poor Harriet Shakespeare!

148
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,440
She must be very worried. A mother always
worries about her children. Have you any children?'

149
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:24,370
she asked the Hare-woman. 'Ye-es, yes, I have.
A son, Philip, almost fourteen.'

150
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:32,590
'Well, well! My daughter Rachel and Jinny
here are both nearly fourteen. Are you staying

151
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,770
near here?'

152
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:40,320
The Hare-woman laughed. 'Well, yes, we're
staying in your cottage. We arrived late last

153
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
night.'

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,839
'Oh, you're Mrs Doyle!' Mrs Hollins said,
and shook the stranger's hand warmly. So the

155
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,110
Hare-woman was one of the visitors to the
cottage thought Jinny.

156
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,490
'In fact, I hope we didn't wake everyone in
the village up last night,' said the Hare-woman.

157
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:05,790
'Philip fell over and crashed into some furniture.
There was a terrible noise. He hit his head,

158
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,190
so he'll be in bed for a while.'

159
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,500
Jinny said nothing, but she knew that wasn't
true.

160
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,980
'We were very tired,' continued the Hare-woman,
'so we took Philip upstairs and went to bed

161
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
immediately.'

162
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:27,190
Another lie! thought Jinny. You didn't go
to bed immediately. You hammered and hammered.

163
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,390
Why are you lying?

164
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,250
Suddenly the Hare-woman seemed to remember
something. She stopped talking, bought some

165
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,100
food and hurried out.

166
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,150
Jinny walked slowly back to the farm. At first
she had liked the stranger, with her beautiful

167
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,040
honest eyes. But why was she lying?

168
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,220
CHAPTER TWO
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COTTAGE?

169
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,810
DAY THREE - TUESDAY 9TH AUGUST
8.00 A.M.

170
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,230
Tug was lying on the bed. He hadn't slept
since the Man and the Woman walked out after

171
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,550
their first visit, hours ago. The music had
a strong beat which hammered at the inside

172
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,790
of his head, and it hadn't stopped all night.
He was very tired, and hungry and thirsty.

173
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,020
But he was watching the door and waiting for
Them.

174
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,920
When the door opened, the music was louder
for a moment as the Man entered. He looked

175
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,940
at Tug.

176
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,070
'Did you sleep well?' he asked, after a moment.

177
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,779
'No,' said Tug. 'I - I'm thirsty.'

178
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:37,040
'Have some water,' answered the Man. 'I've
brought some.' And he offered Tug a glass

179
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
of water.

180
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm not taking anything from you, Tug wanted
to say, before you tell me what's happening.

181
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,610
But he was so thirsty! He took the glass and
drank all the water. Then he turned to the

182
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,560
Man and said, 'Tell me-'

183
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,890
'Sit down on the bed,' ordered the Man.

184
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:03,510
Something in the Man's face told Tug that
it was not a good idea to refuse. He sat down.

185
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,200
The Man opened the door and, while watching
Tug carefully, put his arm outside. And suddenly

186
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,560
the music stopped.

187
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:18,250
Tug fell back on the bed, free from the terrible
noise at last. The room was beautifully silent.

188
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:26,430
Then he heard someone climbing the stairs.
The Woman walked in. She was carrying a tray.

189
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:34,830
'Breakfast,' she said. 'Look.' It was a dream
breakfast. A big plate of fried eggs, tomatoes

190
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,690
and bread, with a cup of hot, strong tea.

191
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,839
Tug could not stop looking at the tray. But
the Woman did not move. She stayed near the

192
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:45,839
door.

193
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,190
'Well?' he said at last. 'Isn't it for me?'

194
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,500
'Oh yes,' she replied. 'It's for you. But
what do you say first?'

195
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm not a child! thought Tug angrily. She's
teaching me to be polite! But he was very

196
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
hungry.

197
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
'Thank you,' he said.

198
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,770
'Thank you - what?' she asked.

199
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,030
'I don't understand,' said Tug. Is this a
game?

200
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,209
'You usually call her something,' said the
Man.

201
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:27,840
Tug began to see what they wanted. Were they
serious? He pretended that he still didn't

202
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
understand.

203
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,190
'What do you mean? What do I usually call
her?'

204
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:39,210
It was the Woman who answered. 'You usually
call me Ma. And your breakfast will be cold

205
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,210
soon.'

206
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,559
But Tug wasn't ready to do what they wanted
yet. He turned to the Man. 'And I suppose

207
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,420
I call you Dad!'

208
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:54,410
'No,' smiled the Man calmly. 'You could, but
you don't. You call me Doyle.'

209
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:04,960
Doyle... Ma... Tug looked from one to the
other. It almost seemed true. Suddenly he

210
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
shouted, 'You're crazy! All that's rubbish!
Why don't you explain what's happening...'

211
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,340
The door banged shut. The Woman had walked
out and taken his breakfast with her.

212
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:22,720
'That was stupid of you,' said Doyle. 'She's
angry with you. Mothers are like that sometimes,

213
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
aren't they?'

214
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,570
'But -' said Tug, and stopped. He could hear
her climbing up the stairs again.

215
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,190
'Now be careful this time,' said Doyle quietly.

216
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:41,700
The Woman entered again, with the tray. Tug
could smell the hot food. It looked wonderful.

217
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,560
'Breakfast,' said the Woman, for the second
time.

218
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:53,040
What does it matter? thought Tug. Ma isn't
what I call my mother. I call her Hank.

219
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,910
'Thank you - Ma,' he said. The Woman gave
him the tray, and left the room. As Doyle

220
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,366
followed her, he turned and smiled slowly
at Tug. 'Have a good breakfast - Philip.'

221
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:13,220
'I'm not Philip!' Tug shouted. 'And you're
not my parents!' But the door had already

222
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
closed.

223
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,309
And then the music started. With that terrible
beat in his head, he wasn't sure of anything

224
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,309
any more.

225
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:27,110
10.00 A.M.
Jinny was digging in the garden. While she

226
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:34,400
was working, she was talking angrily to herself.
Forget it! Its nothing to do with you! But

227
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,160
she couldn't stop herself thinking of the
Hare-woman. Why had she lied about the noises

228
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,360
in the night? And why had there been so much
hammering at the cottage?

229
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,050
Suddenly she had an idea. She could go up
to the cottage now. She knew that she should

230
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,539
go on with her work - there were always lots
of jobs to do on the Slatterys' small farm

231
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,700
- but she really wanted to understand the
mystery. Perhaps the Hare-woman had a good

232
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,150
reason for lying and perhaps she would tell
Jinny all about it...

233
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,360
Soon she was walking up the narrow road to
the moors. The cottage was on the left, but

234
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,400
she didn't go up to it. She climbed up the
small hill behind the house, and hid in the

235
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,720
trees halfway up the hill. She couldn't see
anybody in the cottage, but she could hear

236
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,210
a radio playing loud music.

237
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,450
Something was different about the cottage...
Jinny went a few steps nearer, to look more

238
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,679
closely at the window in the roof...

239
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,250
Suddenly a voice spoke from below. 'Hallo.'

240
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:42,380
'Oh!' cried Jinny in surprise, and the branch
that she was holding broke. She fell, and

241
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,600
slid all the way down the hill to the cottage
garden.

242
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,370
'Well, well!' said the voice. Jinny looked
up. It was a man with black hair and cold

243
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,370
blue eyes. He looked angry.

244
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:03,120
Jinny thought fast. 'I - I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to - You see, I was looking for - for

245
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,500
- mushrooms.' Would he believe her? She continued
quickly, 'They're very good to eat, er, fried

246
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,040
in butter, for breakfast -'

247
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,610
'Yes.' The cold voice stopped her. 'But perhaps
you'd like to find a different place to look

248
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,059
for mushrooms. We're here on holiday, you
see, and we don't want people crashing in

249
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:30,920
through the kitchen window.' He was holding
her by the arm as he spoke, and pulling her

250
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,660
away from the cottage. Jinny was frightened.

251
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,101
Just then she heard a single wild shout from
inside the cottage, followed immediately by

252
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:46,590
a crashing sound. The loud music went on playing.
The man shouted towards the house, 'Oh, be

253
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,110
quiet, Philip!' He's pretending to be a father
who's angry with his son, thought Jinny, but

254
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,260
I don't believe him! Why is he so cold and
unfriendly? Is he hiding something?

255
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,540
But she was shaking a little after her fall,
and she was still afraid of the man. So she

256
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,250
pulled her arm away, and said quickly, 'I
- I must go home.' She knew that he was watching

257
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,720
her as she hurried away from the cottage.

258
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,410
10.30 A.M.
The music was still playing in the bedroom.

259
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,500
Tug had just finished his breakfast when he
heard the noise of Jinny's fall outside. He

260
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,700
jumped on to the bed and looked out of the
window. He could only see the sky and the

261
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,450
tops of trees, but he heard a girl saying,
'They're very good to eat, fried in butter,

262
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:40,340
for breakfast -' Who was she? Could he send
her a message? Would it be dangerous? Then

263
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,220
he heard feet running up the stairs. It was
now or never. He pushed open the window and

264
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,160
shouted as loudly as possible, 'Help!'

265
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,790
The next moment the Woman had crashed into
him. He fell on to the floor, and she held

266
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:03,490
him down with one strong hand over his mouth.
She only let him get up when she heard the

267
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,671
Man come back into the house.

268
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:11,530
'Right!' she said. 'Now you learn to obey
orders!' She hit him hard across the face,

269
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:17,170
on one side and then the other. She went on
hitting him, in time to the beat of the music.

270
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:23,460
Tug began to think that she would never stop.
He was trying hard not to scream, because

271
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:30,100
when he started, he would go on and on, like
her... Then suddenly Doyle was there. He put

272
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:40,590
a finger on the Woman's arm. Just one finger.
And no words. But it was enough. She stopped.

273
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:51,071
'Stupid woman,' said Doyle calmly. 'Stupid
to hit his face. Get some water.' She went

274
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:52,071
downstairs.

275
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,670
'She hit me,' said Tug. 'Just because I -'

276
00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,700
'You have to understand,' Doyle said quietly.
'We'll kill you if we have to.'

277
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,870
The room seemed very quiet, although the music
was still playing. I've never been really

278
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:13,490
afraid before, thought Tug. He was full of
a deep, cold fear. For the first time in his

279
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:19,700
life, he realized that he could die. Not in
a hundred years, or when he was very old,

280
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,590
but now. Today or tomorrow.

281
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:29,140
But the moment passed. Soon Doyle and the
Woman were washing Tug's face, like careful

282
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,760
parents. When the Woman left the room, Doyle
sat by the door. Now he had a gun with him,

283
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,831
which he was cleaning. Tug could not take
his eyes off the cold grey gun. Perhaps he's

284
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:44,740
going to kill me now... to shoot me with the
gun...

285
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,559
At last Doyle put the gun down. Suddenly angry,
Tug shouted, 'How can you two pretend to be

286
00:24:51,559 --> 00:25:01,760
my parents? Look what that woman did to my
face! She can't be my mother!'

287
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,630
'Most murders happen in the family, you know.
Your family are the people who can give you

288
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,630
most pain. They know how to hurt you. Parents
are the worst.'

289
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,790
'Then why are you trying to hurt me?' asked
Tug.

290
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:20,100
'Trying to hurt you? No, Philip, we're doing
our best for you. But we're prisoners of the

291
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,620
family ourselves. Like the rest of the world.'

292
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,520
And he smiled as he picked up his gun again.

293
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,890
11.00 A.M.
Jinny was still running when she reached the

294
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:37,929
village. I must tell Keith what's happening
at the cottage! I know he'll listen to me!

295
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:43,590
Keith was Rachel Hollins' brother, and Jinny's
best friend in the village, although he was

296
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,049
five years older than her.

297
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,940
She found him in the Hollins' sitting-room,
with a lot of different newspapers in front

298
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,040
of him.

299
00:25:52,040 --> 00:26:01,100
'Keith!' she cried. 'I've got to tell you!
It was so awful! I didn't do anything wrong

300
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,080
but he -'

301
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,603
She began to cry as she started speaking.
But Keith always took care of her. He gave

302
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:11,100
her his cup of tea.

303
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:17,780
'Now, drink that, Jinny,' he told her. 'You'll
feel better in a moment. Then tell me all

304
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,560
about it.'

305
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,580
She told him about the people at the cottage,
and explained how the Hare-woman had told

306
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:29,710
lies in Mrs Hollins' shop. 'So I went to the
cottage to see,' she continued. 'And I slid

307
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,580
down the hill behind the house - and there
was an awful man who told me to go away. But

308
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,990
the really important thing is what I heard!'

309
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:44,799
'Tell me quickly, or I'll die of excitement.'
Keith was laughing quietly to himself.

310
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:54,210
'Listen,' she said angrily. 'It's serious.
I heard someone shouting "Help!" And the person

311
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,610
who shouted meant it. Now what do you think,
Keith?'

312
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:03,040
'Well,' said Keith, after thinking for a moment.
'Perhaps someone was just playing a game.'

313
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:11,580
'A game! No! There was hammering - and she
told lies - and I heard the shout! These are

314
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
facts!'

315
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,240
'These newspapers have all got facts in,'
said Keith. 'But they make different stories

316
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,730
out of the same facts. That's my school work
for the summer - to take a story and follow

317
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,169
it in all the newspapers for a week, to see
how different the stories are, although the

318
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,490
facts are the same. Can you think of a story
that I could follow?'

319
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,260
Jinny remembered the Hare-woman in the shop,
listening to the radio. 'You could do the

320
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,169
story of Harriet Shakespeare's son, you know,
held by terrorists. But Keith, you're forgetting

321
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:49,950
my story! What about the voice that shouted
"Help!"? What can I do?'

322
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:56,740
'I agree it is a bit strange. But there's
probably a good reason for it. If you find

323
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:04,080
some more facts, I'll ask my father to investigate
it. But now I really must start reading these

324
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,970
newspapers. Sorry I can't help.'

325
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,430
I'll investigate it myself, thought Jinny
crossly.

326
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:15,910
DAY FOUR - WEDNESDAY 10TH AUGUST
11.00 A.M.

327
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:23,251
Tug felt terrible. The music had given him
a headache. He was alone for a moment, while

328
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:29,350
Doyle and the Woman were downstairs. He looked
tiredly round the room, at the cupboard, the

329
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:35,419
walls, the wallpaper ... An idea suddenly
came to him. I'll tear a piece of paper off

330
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:41,010
the wall behind the cupboard, nobody will
notice... He pulled at a corner of the paper.

331
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:48,669
Hurry, hurry! One of Them will be back soon.
Now he had a large piece of paper in his hand.

332
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:54,290
With the pencil that he always kept in his
pocket, he wrote a few words quickly on the

333
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,400
paper. Then, with his hands shaking, he folded
the paper into the shape of a dart. Hurry,

334
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,799
hurry! He jumped on to the bed, pushed his
arm through the bars, and threw the dart as

335
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,620
far as possible out of the open window. That's
your only chance to get a message to the outside

336
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,770
world, he told himself. I hope that someone
finds it soon!

337
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,920
CHAPTER THREE
FREE PEOPLE

338
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,600
DAY FIVE - THURSDAY 11TH AUGUST
6.30 A.M.

339
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,240
As Jinny did her work on the farm, she could
not stop thinking about the mystery of the

340
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,690
Hare-woman and her son. She was hoping to
go back to the cottage today. But at breakfast

341
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,690
her father said, 'You'll have to make the
butter today, Jinny, because your mother is

342
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:46,980
making the bread. Oz,' he said to Jinny's
young brother, 'you're coming to help me mend

343
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,530
the walls round the south field. And Jinny,
you'll have to plant the vegetables as well.

344
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:58,080
I think you'll have time. There's a lot to
do before harvest next week.'

345
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:06,630
Thanks a lot! Jinny thought angrily. Don't
I get any time for myself? It's always the

346
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,770
same!

347
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,700
Later she talked to her mother, Bella, about
it.

348
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,330
'Mum, why do I have to spend all my time working
on the farm? It's the summer holidays now.

349
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:24,840
My school friends all get up late and go riding.
Or shopping, like Rachel.'

350
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,880
'Jinny, you know why we decided to leave London
and buy this farm. Joe was working much too

351
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,530
hard in London. His work was making him ill.
We wanted a healthier, freer life. I agree

352
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,419
that it's hard work, but we chose this life.'

353
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:46,690
'You two chose it, you mean. No one asked
me.'

354
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,880
'All children get the life that their parents
have chosen. You can choose your own life

355
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
when you're old enough.'

356
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:01,620
'But I want some time now! I'm - I'm so angry
with Dad! He gives me too much work to do.

357
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,760
Sometimes I - I almost want to kill him!'

358
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,549
Her mother did not reply immediately. Then
she said quietly, 'It's because you love him

359
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:15,860
that you want to kill him. But it's the wrong
answer. If you kill the people who you love,

360
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,220
or run away from them, you only destroy yourself
in the end. You have to accept them, or change

361
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
yourself.'

362
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,380
Suddenly Jinny realized that it was true.
Accepting what other people wanted, and working

363
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,659
together - that was family life. She smiled
at her mother.

364
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:41,159
5.30 P.M.
Doyle looked at his watch. 'Time to go downstairs.'

365
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:49,070
'What?' said Tug. He had been there for almost
five days now. Was it possible to leave the

366
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,070
room?

367
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,880
Doyle pushed him towards the door, and they
went down the stairs. At the same moment Doyle

368
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,330
turned off the music. For the last two days
it had not stopped for a second. Now, the

369
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,150
house was suddenly silent, and Tug felt frightened.

370
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:11,170
They were in a big sitting-room, full of old
heavy furniture. The Woman was sitting in

371
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,260
an armchair.

372
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:18,549
'Sit down,' she said to Tug. 'We're going
to have a nice family evening in front of

373
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:19,549
the television.'

374
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,800
Clearly, Tug's visit downstairs was planned.
The television news was just starting.

375
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,790
Of course! thought Tug. I'll be in the news!

376
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:37,490
'Good evening. The terrorists who are holding
thirteen-year-old Liam Shakespeare at his

377
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,950
home in London have said that they belong
to "Free People". That is the revolutionary

378
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,960
group which wants to end family life. They
say that they want all children and adults

379
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,670
to live free from the prison of the family.'

380
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:58,330
What's happening? thought Tug. Am I crazy?
How can I be here and in London?

381
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,740
'Our reporter spoke to Liam's mother, Harriet
Shakespeare, at a friend's house today.'

382
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,640
There was Hank. Her small face looked tired,
and Tug could see that she was trying not

383
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:18,409
to cry. Hank, Hank, come and save me from
these people!

384
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:20,809
'Mrs Shakespeare, have you spoken to your
son?' asked the reporter.

385
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:26,030
'No,' replied Hank. 'But we can see him moving
around in the house, so we know he's still

386
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,030
alive.'

387
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,380
'Why do you think this group has taken your
son?'

388
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:37,031
'Well, I suppose that it's because I've investigated
Free People in the past. It's my job to investigate

389
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,520
revolutionary groups.'

390
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:48,820
'You have always said that nobody should give
terrorist groups what they want. Do you still

391
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,070
think that, now that your own son is in danger?'

392
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,670
'Yes, I do. But we - we don't know yet what
the group wants. We'll have to wait and see.'

393
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:04,880
That's a lie! Tug thought. He always knew
when Hank was lying. But she seemed to believe

394
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,960
that he was held by terrorists in London.
And the reporters believed it too.

395
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,289
Doyle and the Woman were watching him carefully.

396
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:17,250
'It's interesting to hear about your friend
Liam, isn't it?' Doyle said slowly.

397
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:25,059
'He isn't my friend-' began Tug. Then he stopped.
He remembered Hank saying, We can see him

398
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:34,049
moving around. Suddenly he felt very tired.
Who am I? Where's home? In the bedroom, with

399
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:37,520
the music, he would feel better. He stood
up.

400
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,970
'I want to go back upstairs.'

401
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:48,129
Doyle put an arm round Tug, and led him upstairs
like a small child.

402
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,009
8.00 P.M.
Keith was very excited about the Liam Shakespeare

403
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,009
story.

404
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:57,170
'Don't you think it's strange?' he asked Jinny.

405
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:04,640
'What do you mean?' she answered. She was
very tired after a long day on the farm.

406
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,070
'Well, I've just shown you all the newspapers
and the video of the six o'clock news. There's

407
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:16,950
Harriet Shakespeare, a brave, loving mother,
worried about her son. A picture of mother-love

408
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,940
and happy families. But it's the wrong picture,
isn't it? The terrorists have made a bad mistake.'

409
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:31,900
Jinny was too tired to think clearly. 'What
do they care? They just want money or something,

410
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,039
don't they?'

411
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:39,859
'Don't you understand? Terrorists aren't strong
enough to change the world by themselves.

412
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:45,069
So they try to make pictures that will change
people's ideas. The Free People group want

413
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:50,019
publicity. And in this Shakespeare story,
they're making a picture that says Mothers

414
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:56,619
are wonderful. But they don't want to say
that. They want to say Destroy family life,

415
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,990
because it's bad for you. Their message to
the world here' - he picked up one of the

416
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,039
papers - 'is that everybody - women, men,
and children - should escape from the prison

417
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:12,400
of the family. So why are they giving us the
wrong message? Yes, it's a very interesting

418
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,570
story, Jinny! What's going to happen?'

419
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,000
DAY SIX - FRIDAY 12TH AUGUST
2.00 A.M.

420
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,489
Tug woke up suddenly from a bad dream. The
room was very dark, and a large shadow was

421
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:33,160
standing over his bed. Tug screamed. A hand
covered his mouth.

422
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,630
'Quiet,' said a voice, very softly. 'Daddy's
going to tell you a bedtime story. When I

423
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,390
was a small boy, I used to wake up in the
night and cry. Because I was afraid of the

424
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,460
dark, you see. Like you. Crying in the dark.'

425
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,549
Tug wanted to say, I wasn't crying. But he
was too frightened to speak. Doyle went on.

426
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:05,609
'And when I started crying, my Daddy used
to come. And he always used to hit me. So

427
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:10,799
I learnt never, never to cry in the dark,
because my Daddy didn't like it. And you know,

428
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:16,650
I've inherited that from my father. I don't
like my son crying in the dark.'

429
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,680
Tug was suddenly very angry. 'But I haven't
inherited anything from you! You're not my

430
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
father!'

431
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,509
Doyle did not seem to hear. 'That's the worst
thing about families. Because my father hit

432
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:37,299
me, I'll hit you, and you'll hit your children.
This will go on and on -'

433
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:43,250
'No! No!' shouted Tug. 'You're not my father!'

434
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:49,890
Suddenly the light went on, and the Woman
stood at the door. 'What's happening?' she

435
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,039
asked angrily.

436
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,999
'I'm just telling him a little story about
family life.' Doyle smiled slowly.

437
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:03,700
The Woman looked at Tug's white, frightened
face. 'Come downstairs with me,' she said.

438
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,009
'I'll make you a hot drink.'

439
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:11,710
In the kitchen Tug said, his voice shaking,
'I didn't - didn't know Doyle was like that.'

440
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:19,990
The Woman laughed. 'Doyle doesn't often get
angry, like me. But he's a very dangerous

441
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,809
man.' For a moment she put her warm hands
round Tug's, and he felt like a small child

442
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:28,640
again. The fear began to disappear.

443
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,210
'Ma, what's going on? I just don't understand.'

444
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:38,150
She put a gentle hand on his head. 'I know
it's difficult, but it'll be all right in

445
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,420
the end. Come on now, back to bed.'

446
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,490
When he was in bed again, Tug suddenly realized
a terrible thing. I called her Ma. And it

447
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,190
was worse than that. In the kitchen he had
actually felt that she was kind and loving,

448
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:04,729
and could be his mother. Was he Philip? Or
Liam? And hadn't anyone found his message?

449
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,809
6.30 P.M.
Jinny and her brother Oz were sitting in the

450
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:11,890
Hollins' sitting- room. On the table in front
of them was the dart that Tug had thrown out

451
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:18,289
of the window. Keith and Mr Hollins were listening
to Jinny's excited story.

452
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:24,430
'You see, Mr Hollins, Oz and I were picking
mushrooms up on the moors near the cottage.

453
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,339
We were - well, we were interested in the
visitors there, so we hid in the trees near

454
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:33,309
their garden. We couldn't see anything, so
we were just leaving when Oz found this piece

455
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:39,489
of paper on the grass! Look! It says, HELP
I AM A PRISONER HERE.'

456
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:46,680
'I can read, Jinny,' said Mr Hollins, smiling.
'Well, what do you want me to do about it?'

457
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,599
'She wants you to go and investigate, Dad,'
said Keith. 'There's something very strange

458
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,359
about those visitors.'

459
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:00,750
'All right then,' said the policeman. 'You
come with me, Jinny. We'll take the police

460
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:07,339
car, drive to the cottage and just ask a few
questions. Oz and Keith can stay here.'

461
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:13,349
When they arrived at the cottage, the Hare-woman
opened the door. She did not seem surprised

462
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,349
at all.

463
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:21,349
'Good evening, Mrs Doyle,' said Mr Hollins.
'Could we come in for a moment?'

464
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:27,700
'Of course.' They went straight into the sitting-room.
There were books, maps and a camera on the

465
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:34,329
table. A family on holiday, thought Jinny.
There was the man with the cold blue eyes,

466
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:39,940
and sitting next to him, a boy with black
hair and very serious ice-blue eyes.

467
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:47,130
'This is my husband,' said the Hare-woman,
'and my son Philip.' They look so alike! thought

468
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,150
Jinny.

469
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:53,770
Mr Hollins was talking about a lost dog. 'We
think that perhaps it came up here on the

470
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,980
moors,' he said.

471
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:00,720
'There's no dog here,' smiled the man. 'But
would you like to look round the house while

472
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
you're here?'

473
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,660
'Good idea,' said Mr Hollins. 'Thank you.'

474
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,650
'I'll come with you,' said the Hare-woman.
They went upstairs.

475
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:18,150
Jinny looked at the boy. He was staring at
her, and his face was very white.

476
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,450
'Talk to the girl, Philip,' said his father.

477
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:29,779
The boy's voice sounded strangely polite.
He was not smiling. 'Where do you live?' he

478
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,779
asked.

479
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:37,219
'Outside the village, on a small farm...'
Jinny was talking quickly, although the boy

480
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:43,970
did not seem interested. And then it happened.
As Mr Hollins and the Hare-woman came downstairs,

481
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:49,089
the man's eyes looked away from Jinny and
the boy for a moment. In that second, while

482
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:53,710
Jinny was talking, the boy stared straight
at her and made the shape of a word with his

483
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,089
mouth. Help.

484
00:41:55,089 --> 00:42:04,890
'We must go, Jinny,' said Mr Hollins. 'Thank
you, Mrs Doyle. Sorry to take up your time.'

485
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:09,660
In the car, as they drove back to the village,
he explained kindly to Jinny, 'Of course you

486
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,709
couldn't know, but the boy's a bit strange.
He's nearly fourteen, but he's like a five-year-old

487
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:22,740
child really. His mother told me all about
it, so you see, there's nothing to investigate.'

488
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,859
7.15 P.M.
Tug watched the police car drive away. He

489
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:32,969
hadn't been brave enough to scream for help,
because of the gun in Doyle's pocket. And

490
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:40,210
what had the girl and the policeman seen?
The Doyle family. But I am Tug, he said angrily

491
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,859
to himself. I'm not Philip Doyle.

492
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,440
'Well, we are a happy family,' said Doyle,
smiling.

493
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,670
'No!' cried Tug. 'It's a lie!'

494
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:59,019
'Of course it's a lie,' agreed the Woman.
'The idea of the happy family is a lie. The

495
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:03,690
family is a prison. We want people to escape
from it.'

496
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,190
'I didn't mean that rubbish!' cried Tug. 'I
meant -'

497
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,530
'Oh Tug!' she said. 'Don't you understand?'

498
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:20,960
Tug had been afraid of Doyle's gun, but he
was much more afraid now. 'What did you call

499
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
me?'

500
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:29,310
'What? Oh, I called you Tug. Don't you remember?
It's the name that I called you when you were

501
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,310
a baby.'

502
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:37,869
'No,' said Tug in a low, frightened voice.
It had been his secret. It was what Hank called

503
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:38,869
him.

504
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:44,121
'Look.' The Woman suddenly opened her large
handbag and brought out an old photo. The

505
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:51,170
photo was of her when she was much younger.
In her arms she was holding a small baby.

506
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,749
'You, six weeks old,' she said, watching Tug.

507
00:43:55,749 --> 00:44:04,130
'No!' said Tug. It can't be true! Suddenly
he took the photo, tore it into two pieces,

508
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:09,579
and threw them wildly on the floor. He looked
up and saw that he had really hurt the Woman.

509
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:11,640
Her face was very white.

510
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:19,299
That night Tug could not sleep. Help me, Hank,
he cried to himself. But now he could not

511
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:25,069
remember Hank's face or voice. The only face
he could see was long and thin, with large

512
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:29,730
golden eyes. Ma's face.

513
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,509
CHAPTER FOUR
A MESSAGE FOR HARRIET

514
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:37,309
DAY EIGHT - SUNDAY 14TH AUGUST
10.00 A.M.

515
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:44,349
Jinny could not forget the white, staring
face of the boy at the cottage. She was busy

516
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:49,220
all day on Saturday, but on Sunday, when her
mother was cooking the hare for lunch, she

517
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,339
walked down to the village to see Keith.

518
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:57,309
'Jinny, the terrorists who're holding Liam
Shakespeare have said what they want!' he

519
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:58,759
said excitedly.

520
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:03,390
'Who? Oh, him! But I want to talk to you about-'

521
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:10,599
'No, listen, this is important. They want
special children's homes all over the country,

522
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,180
where all children under sixteen can live
away from their families.'

523
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,029
'That's crazy,' said Jinny. 'The Government
will never agree to that.'

524
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:26,249
'No, of course not. But it's giving Free People
some publicity for their ideas, isn't it?

525
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:31,680
And they say that they'll shoot Liam if the
Government don't agree by Friday.'

526
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,050
'Poor Harriet Shakespeare! If the terrorists
are asking for something impossible, there's

527
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,880
nothing she can do to help Liam. She must
be so frightened!'

528
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,770
'That's the strange thing! She isn't! Last
night, when I watched her on the news, she

529
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:56,401
looked very calm! And guess what? She said,
"I'm sure I can get Liam out by Friday!" She

530
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:00,650
really did sound sure about it. Here she is
on the video.'

531
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:06,930
On the television Jinny saw Harriet Shakespeare's
small white face and very serious ice-blue

532
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,630
eyes... ice-blue eyes...

533
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,180
'Show me the video again!' Jinny said quickly.

534
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:23,039
'Why?' asked Keith, but Jinny did not answer.
They watched the video again. It must be him!

535
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,209
thought Jinny. But what will happen if I'm
right?

536
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:34,390
'Have you got a photo of Liam, from a newspaper?'
she asked. It's impossible, she was thinking.

537
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,339
The photo that Keith held out to her showed
the face of the boy who was in the cottage.

538
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:46,229
But in the photo his hair was fair, not black.
She picked up a pencil, and carefully changed

539
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:48,119
the colour of his hair to black.

540
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,420
'What are you doing?' asked Keith at last.

541
00:46:53,420 --> 00:47:02,521
Jinny showed him the photo, her hands shaking
with excitement. 'Liam Shakespeare isn't in

542
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:04,589
that London house. He's here in Derbyshire,
in your Mum's cottage!'

543
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:09,670
10.45 A.M.
Tug's room was quiet now, because the music

544
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:17,030
had stopped. He was alone with the questions
in his head, the questions that he could not

545
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,030
answer.

546
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,789
Doyle, the Woman, the television reporters,
Hank, the girl, the policeman, and his own

547
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:25,670
face in the mirror all told him that he was
Philip Doyle, and that Liam Shakespeare was

548
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:31,059
in a house in London. So did he really believe
that they were all wrong and he was right?

549
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:35,759
Was the rest of the world crazy? Or was he
crazy?

550
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:41,519
Just then he heard the church bells from the
village, and realized that it must be Sunday.

551
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:47,210
Last time he had heard them was when he was
running...

552
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:53,039
Yes! Last Sunday I went for a run. Hank was
going to cook me a special meal...

553
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:59,009
No! Last Sunday Doyle and Ma drove me here.
We're on holiday...

554
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:05,200
How could he be sure which really happened?
If I can remember things about myself which

555
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:14,509
are true, I can build up a picture of the
real me. He liked running. He hated bananas.

556
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:20,907
He could make a cake. He could mend bicycles.
He could speak some French...

557
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:24,160
An hour later, he was still remembering things,
when the Woman came to say that lunch was

558
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,549
ready downstairs.

559
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:29,900
When they arrived in the sitting-room, Tug
was surprised to see that they were going

560
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,849
to have a family Sunday lunch. On the big
table there were knives, forks, plates and

561
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:40,029
glasses, and in the centre there was a large
roast chicken with a lot of different vegetables.

562
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:49,599
But Doyle did not sit down. 'Oh, very nice!'
he said, with a cold smile. 'What a lovely

563
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,849
family meal!'

564
00:48:50,849 --> 00:49:00,349
The Woman stared at him angrily. 'Don't be
stupid! What does it matter? It's only a meal!'

565
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:08,400
'Nothing is only itself. Everything means
something. And Sunday lunch means family life.

566
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,499
We're against that, remember?' He turned to
Tug. 'Don't look surprised, Philip. Families

567
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:22,069
often argue during Sunday lunch. My parents
used to argue all Sunday afternoon, and then

568
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:24,759
Dad used to hit us children, again and again.'

569
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:29,839
'We don't want to hear about your past,' said
the Woman.

570
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:34,829
Doyle looked coldly at her. 'It's better than
hearing about your past, about a mother and

571
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:35,829
baby.'

572
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:41,950
The Woman hit Doyle hard in the mouth. But
before Doyle could do or say anything, Tug

573
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,989
said quickly, 'Ma, I'm hungry.'

574
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:49,839
Doyle looked at Tug almost sadly. 'Children
don't like it when their parents argue,' he

575
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,839
said.

576
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:58,309
The Woman laughed and sat down. 'Come on,
let's eat the chicken. After that we're having

577
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:59,329
baked bananas.'

578
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:06,489
'Oh Ma!' cried Tug without thinking. 'You
know I hate bananas. I'll be sick!'

579
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:12,650
'Of course I haven't forgotten,' she replied.
'There's an apple for you.'

580
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:19,119
1.00 P.M.
'Mr Hollins, please believe me!' cried Jinny.

581
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:25,589
'I'm sorry, Jinny,' said the policeman kindly.
'Everybody knows that Liam Shakespeare's in

582
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:32,020
London. How can he be in our cottage? Now
I'm going to have my lunch, so you go home

583
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,440
and forget about it.'

584
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,799
Jinny and Keith walked out of the Hollins'
house.

585
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:43,859
'We must do something!' said Jinny miserably.
'I'm really sure that it's Liam Shakespeare

586
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:44,859
in the cottage.'

587
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:51,799
'And Harriet Shakespeare sounded strange on
the television news, didn't she?' said Keith.

588
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:57,609
'Why was she so sure that Liam would be safe
on Friday? Perhaps she knows that he's not

589
00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:05,420
in London. Listen, I've got an idea. We could
send a message to her. It says in the newspaper

590
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:11,390
that she's staying with a friend, Lucy Mallory.
Well, if we can find Lucy Mallory's phone

591
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,869
number, we can phone her.'

592
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,490
'How can we find her number?'

593
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:21,270
'Well, they've got a London street map and
a London phone book at the library. I'll go

594
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:27,119
there tomorrow and find the phone number.
Can you meet me tomorrow evening? We'll phone

595
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,579
Lucy Mallory together, from the village phone
box.'

596
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:34,769
'All right. Shall we say - about 10 o'clock?'

597
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:40,029
DAY NINE - MONDAY 15TH AUGUST
4.00 P.M.

598
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:46,369
This time the Woman was sitting at the door
of Tug's room. She kept her own gun by the

599
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,699
side of her chair.

600
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:52,950
'Why was Doyle so angry yesterday, Ma?' Tug
asked.

601
00:51:52,950 --> 00:52:00,049
'Oh, you know what he's like. He wants people
to understand. For years he hated his father.

602
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:05,569
He believed that he was bad, because his father
hated him. Then one day he understood. It

603
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:10,039
was the happiest moment of his life.'

604
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:19,479
Did Doyle ever have happy moments? Impossible!
thought Tug. 'What had he understood?' he

605
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:20,479
asked.

606
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:26,200
'That it isn't natural for people to stay
in families for years and years. People stop

607
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:33,199
loving and start hating. That's what happened
to me. That's why I -' She stopped suddenly,

608
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:39,940
then started again. 'Governments and big business
want people to live in families, because if

609
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,170
you've got a family, you've got something
to lose. You don't want to fight against the

610
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:50,940
government. We've got to show people how to
be free! Free to live and free to fight!'

611
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,299
She looked wonderfully tall and strong and
brave, as she stood in the centre of the room

612
00:52:55,299 --> 00:53:01,819
and waved her arms. Tug wanted to jump up
and join her. But a small voice inside his

613
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:08,339
head was saying, If a speaker excites you,
be very careful. Forget the excitement, and

614
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:15,000
think hard about the ideas. It was Hank's
voice. Hank was right, of course.

615
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,219
Then something terrible happened. He thought,
Is Hank real? He knew that Harriet Shakespeare

616
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:27,859
was real because he had seen her on television.
But was she really his mother? Perhaps Hank

617
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:32,579
was only an idea, a wish - the kind of mother
that he would like to have, instead of Ma.

618
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:36,999
Perhaps he was living in a dream world. Crazy
Philip Doyle.

619
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:44,329
He was shaking and could not speak. The Woman
noticed, and came over to put her arms round

620
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,329
him.

621
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:50,519
'What's the matter, Tug? Everything'll be
all right. After tomorrow.'

622
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:59,769
Just then Doyle entered the room, with a tray.
'What's happening?' he asked the Woman coldly.

623
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,690
'What a wonderful picture of motherly love!'

624
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,920
'I was just being a little bit kind...'

625
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,079
'And what about the gun? It's on the bed,
where Philip can reach it.' He picked it up.

626
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:20,119
'That's dangerous.' He stared at the Woman
- a long, cold, hard stare. After a minute

627
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:27,079
she turned away, and went out of the room.

628
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:31,390
Doyle gave the tray to Tug. 'Here's your supper.'

629
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:37,630
'Thanks,' Tug said. He took the tray with
hands that were still shaking.

630
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:38,630
'Thanks - what?'

631
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:41,469
'Oh.' He had forgotten. 'Thanks, Doyle.'

632
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:44,789
9.50 P.M.
Jinny hurried down the road to the village,

633
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:46,930
and saw Keith waiting by the phone box.

634
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:51,579
'Come on,' he said excitedly. 'I've got the
number.'

635
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:59,920
The phone rang and rang. At last a voice answered.
'What number do you want? Who do you want

636
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,549
to speak to? What is your name? What number
are you calling from?'

637
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:11,229
Jinny answered all these questions. Then she
asked Keith, 'What's happening?'

638
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:17,789
'The police are checking all phone calls to
Mrs Shakespeare or her friends, I think.'

639
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:21,729
Then another voice. 'Lucy Mallory here.'

640
00:55:21,729 --> 00:55:27,930
'Please,' said Jinny hurriedly, 'I want to
speak to Harriet Shakespeare. It's important.

641
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,459
It's about Liam.'

642
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:34,009
'Wait a moment.' The woman did not sound friendly.

643
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:39,309
Then another voice spoke, the deep voice that
Jinny and Keith had heard on the television

644
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:40,309
news. 'Yes?'

645
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:48,200
'You - you're Harriet Shakespeare?' asked
Jinny, not sure what to say. 'I - I know where

646
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,569
Liam is.'

647
00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:53,599
'Everyone knows where Liam is.' The voice
was hard.

648
00:55:53,599 --> 00:56:03,229
'But he's not in your house. He's a prisoner,
in my village. I've seen him. He's...'

649
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:08,749
'Listen!' Harriet Shakespeare said angrily.
'You're the fourteenth person who's phoned

650
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:12,150
me at Lucy's to tell me crazy stories about
Liam!'

651
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:18,700
'But you must believe me! The police up here
won't believe me, and we thought, when we

652
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,509
saw you on television, that you knew something,
something that you weren't telling anybody

653
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:24,509
-'

654
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:30,689
'Oh yes? And what do I know?' Suddenly her
voice was very quiet, and worried.

655
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:36,819
'That the terrorists are only pretending to
hold Liam in your house. That really he's

656
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:39,339
in a different place.'

657
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:46,689
'Oh.' She sounded almost thankful, Jinny thought.
Then the voice became angry again. 'Well,

658
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:53,469
you're wrong about that. Now please just forget
it, and don't ring me again.' The phone went

659
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:54,469
dead.

660
00:56:54,469 --> 00:57:00,970
'Well,' said Jinny unhappily, 'we were wrong.
She didn't know anything. She didn't believe

661
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,130
me. And she was awful'

662
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:10,099
'Never mind, Jinny,' said Keith slowly. 'I
agree, we were wrong about what she knew.

663
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:15,279
But I'm sure that she was hiding something.
What could it be?'

664
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:18,859
CHAPTER FIVE
ON THE EDGE

665
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:22,799
DAY TEN - TUESDAY 16TH AUGUST
2.55 A.M.

666
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:29,410
'Tug!' The Woman was trying to wake him. 'Tug!'

667
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:35,289
'Ma? What time is it? What's the matter?'

668
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:42,249
She spoke quietly into his ear. 'Don't speak
so loudly, or you'll wake Doyle. The news

669
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:45,670
is on in a moment.'

670
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:51,700
'In the middle of the night?' But Tug took
the small radio from her and put it near his

671
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,700
ear.

672
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,670
'Good morning. This is the news. Police have
arrested the terrorists who said that they

673
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:02,420
were holding Liam Shakespeare at his home
in London. But when the police entered the

674
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:09,925
house just before midnight, Liam himself was
not there. One of the group is a boy of fifteen,

675
00:58:09,925 --> 00:58:13,930
with fair hair, who looks like Liam. It is
not known why the terrorists were pretending

676
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:19,269
to hold Liam prisoner. The police are continuing
to investigate the matter.'

677
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:22,930
'I don't understand,' said Tug, still half
asleep.

678
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:32,769
She held his hand. 'You're all right. We just
have to wait, wait until the end of today.'

679
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:37,269
Today. Tuesday. 'Aren't you going to tell
me -'

680
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:39,549
'No! Go to sleep now!'

681
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:48,749
But he could not sleep. He had so many things
to think about. Liam Shakespeare had disappeared.

682
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:58,489
So who was Tug? He tried to remember the facts
that he knew about himself. He liked running.

683
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:00,109
He hated bananas...

684
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:04,989
6.45 A.M.
Jinny was getting breakfast ready. She hadn't

685
00:59:04,989 --> 00:59:11,130
slept all night. She knew that she was right
about the boy in the cottage. But today I

686
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:17,359
won't have time to worry about it! she thought,
because it's our harvest day, the busiest

687
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,959
day of the year. All the neighbours were coming
to help.

688
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:26,719
Just then she noticed a car coming up the
narrow road to the farm. A visitor! On harvest

689
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:34,279
day! It was a woman, dressed in an expensive
suit, and wearing sunglasses. Jinny went out

690
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,859
to meet her.

691
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:41,650
'You're Jinny Slattery,' the woman said. Jinny
recognized the deep voice that she had heard

692
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:47,690
on the phone last night. 'You gave your name
and the number of the village phone box, luckily.

693
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:53,930
That's how I found you. I've driven all the
way from London, and the girl in the post

694
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,970
office told me where your farm was.'

695
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:03,989
'But why have you come?' asked Jinny. 'You
didn't believe me last night!'

696
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:09,270
'Haven't you heard the news? Liam isn't at
our home in London. I came to find you because

697
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:20,279
you're the only person who seems to know where
he is. You're my only hope! Where is he? How

698
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:21,825
can I get him out?' She sounded desperate.

699
01:00:21,825 --> 01:00:23,949
'Look, I can show you the house where he is,
but-'

700
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:31,030
'We must hurry! There isn't much time! We've
got to get him out by 2 o'clock today!'

701
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:36,829
7.15 A.M.
Tug knew that today was different from other

702
01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:42,650
days. At breakfast, both Doyle and the Woman
kept their guns on the table by their hands,

703
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:46,529
ready for - what? Tug felt afraid.

704
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:53,150
Doyle stared coldly at Tug. 'Suppose that
this is the last day of your life. What would

705
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,349
you like to do most?'

706
01:00:55,349 --> 01:01:00,160
'Doyle!' said the Woman angrily, and put her
hand on Tug's arm.

707
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:06,279
Doyle continued. 'If you don't know what you'd
choose to do on the last day of your life,

708
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:12,079
you don't know what's really important to
you. Forget about parents and other people.

709
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,699
Only free people know the answer to that question.'

710
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:21,119
'It's not easy to know what you want,' agreed
the Woman. 'Because you need to know who you

711
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,249
really are. Nothing to do with your family.
Just you.'

712
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:32,380
'You think you're Liam Shakespeare,' Doyle
went on. 'We say you're Philip Doyle. Without

713
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:39,539
one of those names, you're nobody. And you
can't answer my question, can you? You don't

714
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:40,819
know who you are!'

715
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:46,730
They were both staring at him, with their
wild, crazy eyes. Why should I play their

716
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:52,699
games? thought Tug. I'm Tug, I like running.
I hate bananas...

717
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:57,779
'Yes, I do know who I am,' he said.

718
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:05,210
Doyle seemed surprised. 'Well?' he said. 'If
you're so sure, what would you do on the last

719
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,049
day of your life?'

720
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:12,130
Tug thought for a moment. He stared out of
the window at the great rocky ridge which

721
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:17,949
stood high against the sky. It looked black
and frightening in the early morning light.

722
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:21,309
'What's that long hill called?' he asked.

723
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:29,359
Doyle smiled. He thought that Tug could not
answer his question. 'That's Ashdale Great

724
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,119
Edge. And the rock at the end is called the
Castle Rock.'

725
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:39,329
'I can tell you what I'd do on the last day
of my life,' Tug said calmly. 'I'd run, all

726
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:43,609
the way along Ashdale Great Edge, from this
end to Castle Rock.'

727
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:47,549
'That's a stupid thing to do!' said Doyle.

728
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:53,979
But I know that's what I want, and nobody
can take that away from me, thought Tug. Then

729
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:58,700
he noticed the Woman looking very sadly at
him. He had to ask her the question.

730
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,690
'So - is this going to be the last day of
my life?'

731
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:09,019
'I think perhaps - not,' Doyle answered. 'It
will be the last day of someone's life, but

732
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,990
not yours, I think.'

733
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:16,249
7.35 A.M.
Around the breakfast table sat Jinny, Oz,

734
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:20,609
their parents, Harriet, and Keith, who had
just arrived.

735
01:03:20,609 --> 01:03:25,569
'So, Mrs Shakespeare,' said Joe Slattery,
'you think that your son is staying in the

736
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:30,479
cottage with people who are probably terrorists.
You don't want to go to the police because

737
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:35,690
it'll take too much time. And you want us
to think of a plan to save your son before

738
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:42,140
two o'clock today. On harvest day, the most
important day of the year for us.'

739
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:46,049
Harriet stared desperately at Joe. 'Yes,'
she said.

740
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:51,929
Joe thought for a moment. 'Well, Keith here
says that one of the Doyles goes to the post

741
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:58,699
office to get a newspaper every day. That'll
give us about twenty minutes. We can send

742
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:05,549
Jinny to the cottage. She goes inside, with
some excuse or other. Then I'll come up with

743
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:10,190
some of the neighbours, we'll knock on the
door, and pull out the person who comes to

744
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:14,650
the door. That way, neither of the Doyles
will get a chance to use a gun, and we can

745
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,819
get both Liam and Jinny out safely.'

746
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:25,029
Nobody spoke for a second. Then Harriet said,
'Yes, it's a good plan. All right, shall we

747
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:27,470
go?' and got up.

748
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:36,160
'Wait,' said Joe suddenly. 'Now I have a question.
Why? You want me to forget about my harvest

749
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,519
and put my daughter in danger. But why today?
The television reporters are saying that the

750
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:49,089
terrorists won't hurt Liam until Friday. That's
what Keith says. So we don't need to hurry.'

751
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:54,759
'I've told you, if the terrorists don't get
what they want by two o'clock today, Liam

752
01:04:54,759 --> 01:04:58,790
will die.' Harriet stared angrily at Joe.

753
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:03,430
Keith suddenly said, 'I don't think they're
really interested in those special homes for

754
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:07,150
children. I think they want something more
important.'

755
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:14,089
'You're right,' said Harriet tiredly. 'They've
got publicity for their ideas now, of course.

756
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:19,189
But - I see that I'll have to tell you what
they really want. They want to do something

757
01:05:19,189 --> 01:05:24,779
that people will remember for a long time.
They want to destroy, to bomb the most famous

758
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:25,900
family in the country.'

759
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:33,719
'You mean -' said Bella Slattery. 'But that's
impossible. The royal family always have police

760
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:36,339
and detectives around them, don't they?'

761
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:42,030
'You only need one terrorist with a bomb,
in the right crowd at the right time. At two

762
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:47,849
o'clock this afternoon,' replied Harriet.
'I was investigating Free People, you see.

763
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:54,010
And when I discovered their plan, they took
Liam, to stop me warning the police. It's

764
01:05:54,010 --> 01:06:00,420
difficult for me, isn't it? If I warn the
police, Free People will kill Liam - and say

765
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:05,410
that he died because his mother, his family,
chose not to save him. But if I don't warn

766
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:10,980
the police, there will be several deaths in
another, more famous family. And Free People

767
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:16,819
will say that they died because of my love
for my son, my family. Either way, Free People

768
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:20,510
win the game, because the idea of the family
gets bad publicity.'

769
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:24,299
She put her head in her hands and sat very
still.

770
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:30,640
Joe stood up. 'I understand now. We'll help
you.'

771
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:36,009
'But -' said Keith miserably, 'shouldn't we
tell the police about the bomb before we start?'

772
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:43,640
'Yes,' said Harriet. She was finding it difficult
to speak. 'I decided yesterday to warn the

773
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:50,059
police. So the royal family are safe. But
Liam will be dead after two o'clock, if we

774
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:51,059
don't get him out.'

775
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:56,410
11.00 A.M.
Doyle had gone out and Tug was washing the

776
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:01,400
breakfast dishes when there was a knock on
the door. The Woman hid the guns and opened

777
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,789
the door. It was the girl who had come with
the policeman.

778
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:11,939
'Hallo, Mrs Doyle,' the girl said politely.
'We just wanted to invite you to our harvest

779
01:07:11,939 --> 01:07:17,599
party this evening. It's very good fun -' She
saw Tug in the kitchen and ran through the

780
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,219
sitting-room to him. 'Do come, Philip.'

781
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:28,130
Just then they heard Doyle's car coming very
fast up the road. Tug saw sudden fear in the

782
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:33,759
girl's face. The car door banged, and Doyle
hurried into the house, shouting orders at

783
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,859
the Woman.

784
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:42,670
'Come on! We've got to leave! Harriet Shakespeare's
in the village! I met that stupid little girl

785
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:50,729
from the post office just down the road, and
she told me! Bring the boy! And that girl!

786
01:07:50,729 --> 01:07:52,749
And the guns and the radio!'

787
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:58,509
In a few moments they were all in the car,
driving fast down the road away from the cottage.

788
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:07,849
'So what's your plan, Doyle?' asked the Woman.
She had her gun in her hand, and was ready

789
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:08,849
to shoot.

790
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:13,309
'You'll see. We're going somewhere safe for
the next two or three hours - Oh no!'

791
01:08:13,309 --> 01:08:18,270
There were four men walking along the road
towards them. Doyle drove faster, straight

792
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:23,170
at them, and at the last moment the men jumped
to one side, shouting and banging on the roof

793
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:29,000
of the car. The next minute the car turned
away from the village, and up to the moors.

794
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:37,850
The car finally stopped high up above the
valley. 'Get out!' ordered Doyle. 'Start walking!'

795
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:43,569
They walked up the long ridge that Tug had
seen from the kitchen window. The wind was

796
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:47,960
strong and cold, and they could see a long
way on both sides of the ridge.

797
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:56,470
'Stop here!' shouted Doyle. Now we wait for
visitors!' They did not have to wait long.

798
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:02,770
Two cars drove fast up the hill and stopped
a few hundred metres away. Tug saw the men

799
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,170
who had been on the road, with a boy who was
older than him, and - Hank.

800
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:13,870
'Stay there!' shouted Doyle to them. He was
holding the girl by her hair, and slowly he

801
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:20,109
put his gun to her head. 'If you come any
nearer, I'll shoot!' Then he smiled at Tug

802
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:27,560
and the Woman. 'Sit down, everyone,' he said.
'We're going to wait and listen to the news.'

803
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:40,000
Why not? thought Tug. It all seemed like a
dream. He sat on the grass, staring at the

804
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
radio.

805
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,040
2.25 P.M.
This is probably the last wind that I'll ever

806
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,242
feel, thought Jinny. When they hear the news,
they'll know that their plan has failed. And

807
01:09:47,242 --> 01:09:53,850
then they'll shoot us. She could see the blue
uniforms of policemen in the little group

808
01:09:53,850 --> 01:10:00,620
of people waiting by the cars. Some policemen
had guns. But Doyle and the Hare-woman were

809
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:04,790
very careful to keep the boy and Jinny in
front of their own bodies.

810
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:11,380
'Right,' said Doyle. 'Now let's listen to
the two-thirty news. We're waiting to hear

811
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:16,920
of some important deaths. If those people
haven't died, you'll know that Harriet Shakespeare

812
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:22,370
chose to save their lives, not her son's.
Because he's less important to her than they

813
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,370
are.'

814
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:31,940
The boy's face went white. It's not true,
Jinny wanted to say, she loves you! I've seen

815
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,960
that!

816
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,660
They listened silently to the news. At the
end, Doyle turned off the radio and said,

817
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,840
'Now, let's talk.'

818
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:47,040
'What about?' asked the boy in a high, frightened
voice. 'You're going to kill me, aren't you?'

819
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:55,460
'Oh, yes,' said Doyle. 'We're going to kill
you. But you can choose something first. Harriet

820
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,720
Shakespeare can't be sure that you're Liam
because she's too far away to see you clearly.

821
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:06,560
And if she's not sure, you can't be sure,
can you? So I'm going to call her over here.

822
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,350
She's going to walk slowly towards us. Then
we can see her face when she decides if you

823
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,730
are Liam or not.'

824
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:18,370
'Then you'll shoot me, I suppose ?' said the
boy.

825
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:21,620
'No, I won't. Your mother will.'

826
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:27,490
Jinny did not understand why the boy turned
to stare at the Hare-woman. 'Ma - would you

827
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:31,310
really shoot me?' he said.

828
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:38,530
Doyle laughed. 'You don't know her very well,
do you? She killed her own baby twelve years

829
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,530
ago.'

830
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,530
Nobody spoke for a moment.

831
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:46,440
'So,' continued Doyle, 'you can wait for Harriet
Shakespeare to decide who you are, to put

832
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:52,070
you in a box with a name on it. Or you can
choose for yourself, and spend your last moments

833
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,480
of life how you want.'

834
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:58,810
'We're giving you the chance to choose,' added
the Hare- woman, almost gently, ' - to choose

835
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,800
who you really are, inside yourself.'

836
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:09,100
Tug tried to think clearly. Oh Hank! What
would you choose? Suddenly, he could hear

837
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:16,950
her voice in his head. Do I have to decide
everything for you? Decide for yourself! He

838
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:24,200
smiled. Of course she was his mother! He knew
it now, without question. Now it was easy

839
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,200
to decide.

840
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:31,850
He stood up. 'I'm ready,' he said, and began
to run away from Hank, along the ridge towards

841
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,660
the Castle Rock.

842
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:40,950
Jinny stared. Why was he running that way?
she thought. But the Hare-woman was now lifting

843
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,110
the gun in her hands, ready to shoot the boy.

844
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:48,910
'You're crazy!' screamed Jinny. 'Don't shoot
him-!'

845
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:56,640
Doyle's hand suddenly covered her mouth. 'Hurry
up, you stupid cow,' he said to the Hare-woman,

846
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,170
'or it'll be too late.'

847
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:03,540
And Jinny could see that the police, the farmers
and Harriet were beginning to come nearer.

848
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:11,040
Jinny stared at the Hare-woman. Her face looked
desperate, like... who was it? Like Harriet

849
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,150
Shakespeare, when she arrived at the farmhouse,
worried about her son, because she loved him.

850
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:21,760
Suddenly Jinny bit Doyle's hand hard, and
pulled her mouth away. She shouted at the

851
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,360
Hare-woman, using the words that her own mother
had used to her.

852
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:31,050
'It's because you love him that you want to
kill him! But if you kill him, you'll only

853
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,220
destroy yourself!'

854
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:38,580
The Hare-woman looked round, surprised. At
that moment, there was a bang and she put

855
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:45,180
her hand to her side. A policeman had shot
her. Doyle ran to take her gun before she

856
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:53,020
fell, but before he could take it, she threw
it high up in the air. It fell over the side

857
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,300
of the ridge.

858
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,340
'Run, Tug, run! You're free!' she called into
the wind.

859
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,940
And Harriet Shakespeare, running towards them,
cried at the same moment, 'Tug, it's all right!

860
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:04,940
You're safe!'

861
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:12,600
Tug heard the sound of the gun, and then the
two shouts behind him. But he did not stop,

862
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,810
because the only thing that mattered was the
running. His legs ached, and his feet hurt,

863
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:23,010
but in front of him was the Castle Rock and
he knew that he could reach it. And as he

864
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:34,930
ran, he sang in his head, This is me. Here
I am, Hank. Here I am, Ma. This is me. This

865
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,480
is who I am.

866
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,000
- THE END -
