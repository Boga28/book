THE ADVENTURES OF BUSTER BEAR

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,960
CHAPTER I

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,320
BUSTER BEAR GOES FISHING

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,920
Buster Bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable 
bed of leaves and watched the first early morning  

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,520
sunbeams creeping through the Green Forest to 
chase out the Black Shadows. Once more he yawned,  

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,520
and slowly got to his feet and shook himself. 
Then he walked over to a big pine-tree,  

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,360
stood up on his hind legs, reached as high 
up on the trunk of the tree as he could,  

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,320
and scratched the bark with his great claws. 
After that he yawned until it seemed as if  

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,680
his jaws would crack, and then sat down 
to think what he wanted for breakfast.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,040
While he sat there, trying to make up his mind 
what would taste best, he was listening to the  

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,920
sounds that told of the waking of all the 
little people who live in the Green Forest.  

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
He heard Sammy Jay way off 
in the distance screaming,

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:19,680
"Thief! Thief!" and grinned. "I wonder," thought 
Buster, "if some one has stolen Sammy's breakfast,  

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,840
or if he has stolen the breakfast of some 
one else. Probably he is the thief himself."

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,600
He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding 
as fast as he could make his tongue go  

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
and working himself into a terrible rage.  

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,080
"Must be that Chatterer got out of bed 
the wrong way this morning," thought he.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,440
He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top of 
his lungs, and he knew by the sound that Blacky  

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,200
was getting into mischief of some kind. He heard 
the sweet voices of happy little singers, and they  

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:01,120
were good to hear. But most of all he listened to 
a merry, low, silvery laugh that never stopped but  

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,640
went on and on, until he just felt as if he must 
laugh too. It was the voice of the Laughing Brook.

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,080
And as Buster listened it suddenly came 
to him just what he wanted for breakfast.

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,240
"I'm going fishing," said he in his deep 
grumbly-rumbly voice to no one in particular.  

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,080
"Yes, Sir, I'm going fishing. I want 
some fat trout for my breakfast."

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,160
He shuffled along over to the Laughing 
Brook, and straight to a little pool of  

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,160
which he knew, and as he drew near he took 
the greatest care not to make the teeniest,  

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,600
weeniest bit of noise. Now it just happened 
that early as he was, some one was before  

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Buster Bear. When he came in sight 
of the little pool, who should

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,840
he see but another fisherman there, who 
had already caught a fine fat trout.  

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,560
Who was it? Why, Little Joe Otter to be 
sure. He was just climbing up the bank  

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,360
with the fat trout in his mouth. Buster 
Bear's own mouth watered as he saw it.  

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Little Joe sat down on the bank and 
prepared to enjoy his breakfast.  

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,960
He hadn't seen Buster Bear, and he didn't know 
that he or any one else was anywhere near.

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:31,840
Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until 
he was right behind Little Joe Otter.

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,840
"Woof, woof!" said he in his 
deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice.  

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,920
"That's a very fine looking trout. 
I wouldn't mind if I had it myself."

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,080
Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal and 
without even turning to see who was speaking  

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
dropped his fish and dived 
headfirst into the Laughing Brook.

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
Buster Bear sprang forward 
and with one of his big paws  

40
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,200
caught the fat trout just as it 
was slipping back into the water.

41
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,360
"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter," said he, as 
Little Joe put his head out of water to see  

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
who had frightened him so. "Come and get it."

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,146
Illus Here's your trout, Mr. Otter, said he

44
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:11,664
Here's your trout, Mr. Otter, said he.

45
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:11,760
Page 5.

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,880
But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he was 
afraid to. He snarled at Buster Bear and called  

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,720
him a thief and everything bad he could think 
of. Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as  

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,240
if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his 
invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish.  

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,400
But Little Joe just turned his back and went 
off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,640
"It's too bad to waste such a fine 
fish," said Buster thoughtfully.  

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,400
"I wonder what I'd better do with it." And 
while he was wondering, he ate it all up.  

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,840
Then he started down the Laughing 
Brook to try to catch some for himself.

53
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,360
CHAPTER II

54
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,760
LITTLE JOE OTTER GETS EVEN WITH BUSTER BEAR

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,720
Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage. It 
was a bad beginning for a beautiful day and  

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,240
Little Joe knew it. But who wouldn't be in 
a rage if his breakfast was taken from him  

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,800
just as he was about to eat it? Anyway, that 
is what Little Joe told Billy Mink. Perhaps he  

58
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,040
didn't tell it quite exactly as it was, but you 
know he was very badly frightened at the time.

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
"I was sitting on the bank of the Laughing 
Brook beside one of the little pools,"

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,640
he told Billy Mink, "and was just going to eat 
a fat trout I had caught, when who should come  

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,720
along but that great big bully, Buster Bear. 
He took that fat trout away from me and ate it  

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,600
just as if it belonged to him! I hate him! If I 
live long enough I'm going to get even with him!"

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
Of course that wasn't nice talk 
and anything but a nice spirit,  

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,240
but Little Joe Otter's temper 
is sometimes pretty short,  

65
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,800
especially when he is hungry, and this 
time he had had no breakfast, you know.

66
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Buster Bear hadn't actually taken the fish away 
from Little Joe. But looking at the matter as  

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Little Joe did, it amounted to the same thing. 
You see, Buster knew perfectly well when he  

68
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,920
invited Little Joe to come back and get it that 
Little Joe wouldn't dare do anything of the kind.

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
"Where is he now?" asked Billy Mink.

70
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,600
"He's somewhere up the Laughing Brook. 
I wish he'd fall in and get drowned!"

71
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,640
snapped Little Joe.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,240
Billy Mink just had to laugh. The idea of great 
big Buster Bear getting drowned in the Laughing  

73
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,880
Brook was too funny. There wasn't water enough 
in it anywhere except down in the Smiling Pool,  

74
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,360
and that was on the Green Meadows, 
where Buster had never been known to go.  

75
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
"Let's go see what he is doing," said Billy Mink.

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,920
At first Little Joe didn't want to, but at 
last his curiosity got the better of his fear,

77
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
and he agreed. So the two 
little brown-coated scamps  

78
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,800
turned down the Laughing Brook, taking 
the greatest care to keep out of sight  

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,400
themselves. They had gone only a little way 
when Billy Mink whispered: "Sh-h! There he is."

80
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,080
Sure enough,  

81
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,960
there was Buster Bear sitting close beside a 
little pool and looking into it very intently.

82
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
"What's he doing?"  

83
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,520
asked Little Joe Otter, as Buster Bear 
sat for the longest time without moving.

84
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,520
Just then one of Buster's big paws 
went into the water as quick as a flash  

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,960
and scooped out a trout 
that had ventured too near.

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,960
"He's fishing!" exclaimed Billy Mink.

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,640
And that is just what Buster Bear was doing, 
and it was very plain to see that he was having  

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,080
great fun. When he had eaten the trout he had 
caught, he moved along to the next little pool.

89
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,400
"They are our fish!" said Little Joe fiercely. 
"He has no business catching our fish!"

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,120
"I don't see how we are going 
to stop him," said Billy Mink.

91
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,600
"I do!" cried Little Joe, into whose head 
an idea had just popped. "I'm going to drive  

92
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,680
all the fish out of the little 
pools and muddy the water all up.  

93
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Then we'll see how many fish he will get! 
Just you watch me get even with Buster Bear."

94
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,000
Little Joe slipped swiftly into the water and swam 
straight to the little pool that Buster Bear would  

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,560
try next. He frightened the fish so that they 
fled in every direction. Then he stirred up  

96
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,920
the mud until the water was so dirty that Buster 
couldn't have seen a fish right under his nose. He  

97
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,120
did the same thing in the next pool and the next. 
Buster Bear's fishing was spoiled for that day.

98
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,160
CHAPTER III

99
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
BUSTER BEAR IS GREATLY PUZZLED

100
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,000
Buster Bear hadn't enjoyed himself so much 
since he came to the Green Forest to live.  

101
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,600
His fun began when he surprised Little Joe 
Otter on the bank of a little pool in the  

102
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Laughing Brook and Little Joe was so frightened 
that he dropped a fat trout he had just caught.  

103
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,280
It had seemed like a great joke to Buster Bear, 
and he had chuckled over it all the time he was  

104
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,120
eating the fat trout. When he had finished 
it, he started on to do some fishing himself.

105
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,400
Presently he came to another little pool. 
He stole up to it very, very softly,  

106
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,560
so as not to frighten the fish. Then he sat 
down close to the edge of it and didn't move.

107
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,600
Buster learned a long time ago that 
a fisherman must be patient unless,  

108
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,520
like Little Joe Otter, he is just as much 
at home in the water as the fish themselves,  

109
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,400
and can swim fast enough to catch them by chasing 
them. So he didn't move so much as an eye lash.  

110
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,280
He was so still that he looked 
almost like the stump of an old tree.

111
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Perhaps that is what the fish thought he was, for 
pretty soon, two or three swam right in close to  

112
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,000
where he was sitting. Now Buster Bear may be big 
and clumsy looking, but there isn't anything that  

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,080
can move much quicker than one of those big paws 
of his when he wants it to. One of them moved now,  

114
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,280
and quicker than a wink had scooped one 
of those foolish fish out on to the bank.

115
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,400
Buster's little eyes twinkled, and he smacked 
his lips as he moved on to the next little pool,  

116
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,000
for he knew that it was of no use 
to stay longer at the first one.  

117
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,280
The fish were so frightened that they 
wouldn't come back for a long, long time.  

118
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,000
At the next little pool the same thing 
happened. By this time Buster Bear was  

119
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,680
in fine spirits. It was fun to catch the 
fish, and it was still more fun to eat them.  

120
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:16,480
What finer breakfast could any one have than 
fresh-caught trout? No wonder he felt good! But it  

121
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,480
takes more than three trout to fill Buster Bear's 
stomach, so he kept on to the next little pool.

122
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,440
But this little pool, instead of being beautiful 
and clear so that Buster could see right to the  

123
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,720
bottom of it and so tell if there were any 
fish there, was so muddy that he couldn't  

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,080
see into it at all. It looked as if some one 
had just stirred up all the mud at the bottom.

125
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,360
"Huh!" said Buster Bear. "It's 
of no use to try to fish here.  

126
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,720
I would just waste my time. 
I'll try the next pool."

127
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,760
So he went on to the next little pool. 
He found this just as muddy as the other.

128
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,560
Then he went on to another, and this was no 
better. Buster sat down and scratched his head. It  

129
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,600
was puzzling. Yes, Sir, it was puzzling. He looked 
this way and he looked that way suspiciously,  

130
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,120
but there was no one to be seen. Everything was 
still save for the laughter of the Laughing Brook.  

131
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,800
Somehow, it seemed to Buster as 
if the Brook were laughing at him.

132
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,280
"It's very curious," muttered Buster,  

133
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:45,360
"very curious indeed. It looks as if my fishing 
is spoiled for to-day. I don't understand it at  

134
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,080
all. It's lucky I caught what I did. It 
looks as if somebody is trying to—ha!"  

135
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,960
A sudden thought had popped into his head. 
Then he began to chuckle and finally to laugh.  

136
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:09,680
"I do believe that scamp Joe Otter is trying 
to get even with me for eating that fat trout!"

137
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,520
And then, because Buster Bear always enjoys 
a good joke even when it is on himself,  

138
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,520
he laughed until he had to hold 
his sides, which is a whole lot  

139
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,560
better than going off in a rage as Little 
Joe Otter had done. "You're pretty smart, Mr.

140
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,960
Otter! You're pretty smart, but there are other 
people who are smart too," said Buster Bear,  

141
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,960
and still chuckling, he went off to think up 
a plan to get the best of Little Joe Otter.

142
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,840
CHAPTER IV

143
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,960
LITTLE JOE OTTER SUPPLIES BUSTER

144
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
BEAR WITH A BREAKFAST

145
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
Getting even just for spite

146
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,040
Doesn't always pay.

147
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,080
Fact is, it is very apt

148
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,520
To work the other way.

149
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,120
That is just how it came about that Little 
Joe Otter furnished Buster Bear with the  

150
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,200
best breakfast he had had for a long time. He 
didn't mean to do it. Oh, my, no! The truth is,  

151
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,000
he thought all the time that he was preventing 
Buster Bear from getting a breakfast.  

152
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You see he wasn't well enough acquainted with 
Buster to know that Buster is quite as smart  

153
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,200
as he is, and perhaps a little bit smarter. 
Spite and selfishness were at the bottom of it.  

154
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,440
You see Little Joe and Billy Mink had had all the 
fishing in the Laughing Brook to themselves so  

155
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,480
long that they thought no one else had any right 
to fish there. To be sure Bobby Coon caught a few  

156
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,440
little fish there, but they didn't mind Bobby. 
Farmer Brown's boy fished there too, sometimes,  

157
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
and this always made Little Joe and Billy Mink 
very angry, but they were so afraid of him that  

158
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,960
they didn't dare do anything about it. But when 
they discovered that Buster Bear was a fisherman,  

159
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,960
they made up their minds that something had 
got to be done. At least, Little Joe did.

160
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,440
"He'll try it again to-morrow 
morning," said Little Joe.  

161
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:25,840
"I'll keep watch, and as soon as I see him coming, 
I'll drive out all the fish, just as I did to-day.  

162
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,920
I guess that'll teach him to let our fish alone."

163
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,960
So the next morning Little Joe hid before 
daylight close by the little pool where  

164
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,840
Buster Bear had given him such a fright. Sure 
enough, just as the Jolly Sunbeams began to  

165
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,120
creep through the Green Forest, he saw Buster 
Bear coming straight over to the little pool.  

166
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,600
Little Joe slipped into the water and 
chased all the fish out of the little pool,  

167
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,720
and stirred up the mud on the bottom so that the 
water was so muddy that the bottom couldn't be  

168
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,160
seen at all. Then he hurried down to the 
next little pool and did the same thing.

169
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,760
Now Buster Bear is very smart. You 
know he had guessed the day before who

170
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,360
had spoiled his fishing. So this morning he 
only went far enough to make sure that if  

171
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,720
Little Joe were watching for him, as he was 
sure he would be, he would see him coming.  

172
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,000
Then, instead of keeping on to the little pool, 
he hurried to a place way down the Laughing Brook,  

173
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,560
where the water was very shallow, hardly over 
his feet, and there he sat chuckling to himself.  

174
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
Things happened just as he had expected.  

175
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,120
The frightened fish Little Joe chased out of 
the little pools up above swam down the Laughing  

176
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,440
Brook, because, you know, Little Joe was behind 
them, and there was nowhere else for them to go.  

177
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,000
When they came to the place where Buster was 
waiting, all he had to do was to scoop them out  

178
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,080
on to the bank. It was great fun. It didn't take 
Buster long to catch all the fish he could eat.

179
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,840
Then he saved a nice fat trout and waited.

180
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,120
By and by along came Little Joe Otter, chuckling 
to think how he had spoiled Buster Bear's fishing.  

181
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,520
He was so intent on looking behind 
him to see if Buster was coming  

182
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,880
that he didn't see Buster 
waiting there until he spoke.

183
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,840
"I'm much obliged for the fine 
breakfast you have given me,"  

184
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,920
said Buster in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly 
voice. "I've saved a fat trout for you to  

185
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,520
make up for the one I ate yesterday. I 
hope we'll go fishing together often."

186
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,120
Then he went off laughing fit to kill himself. 
Little Joe couldn't find a word to say.  

187
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,160
He was so surprised and angry that he went 
off by himself and sulked. And Billy Mink,  

188
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,400
who had been watching, ate the fat trout.

189
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
CHAPTER V

190
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,520
GRANDFATHER FROG'S COMMON-SENSE

191
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,400
There is nothing quite like common sense to smooth 
out troubles. People who have plenty of just plain  

192
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,720
common sense are often thought to be very wise. 
Their neighbors look up to them and are forever  

193
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,200
running to them for advice, and they are very much 
respected. That is the way with Grandfather Frog.  

194
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,800
He is very old and very wise. Anyway, that 
is what his neighbors think. The truth is,  

195
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,120
he simply has a lot of common sense, which 
after all is the very best kind of wisdom.

196
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,360
Now when Little Joe Otter found that Buster Bear 
had been too smart for him and that instead of  

197
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,280
spoiling Buster's fishing in the Laughing Brook 
he had really made it easier for Buster to catch  

198
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,080
all the fish he wanted, Little Joe went off 
down to the Smiling Pool in a great rage.

199
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
Billy Mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish  

200
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,080
Buster had left on the bank and then 
he too went down to the Smiling Pool.

201
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,240
When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink reached the 
Smiling Pool, they climbed up on the Big Rock, and  

202
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,720
there Little Joe sulked and sulked, until finally 
Grandfather Frog asked what the matter was.  

203
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,840
Little Joe wouldn't tell, but Billy Mink told 
the whole story. When he told how Buster had  

204
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,360
been too smart for Little Joe, it tickled him so 
that Billy had to laugh in spite of himself. So  

205
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,640
did Grandfather Frog. So did Jerry Muskrat, who 
had been listening. Of course this made Little  

206
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,600
Joe angrier than ever. He said a lot of unkind 
things about Buster Bear and about Billy Mink  

207
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,000
and Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat, because 
they had laughed at the smartness of Buster.

208
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,600
"He's nothing but a great big bully 
and thief!" declared Little Joe.

209
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,480
"Chug-a-rum! He may be a bully, because 
great big people are very apt to be bullies,  

210
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,160
and though I haven't seen him, I guess Buster 
Bear is big enough from all I have heard,  

211
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
but I don't see how he is a 
thief," said Grandfather Frog.

212
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,280
"Didn't he catch my fish and eat them?" snapped 
Little Joe. "Doesn't that make him a thief?"

213
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
"They were no more your fish 
than mine," protested Billy Mink.

214
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,080
"Well, our fish, then! He stole our 
fish, if you like that any better.  

215
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,960
That makes him just as much a thief, 
doesn't it?" growled Little Joe.

216
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:01,120
Grandfather Frog looked up at jolly, round, 
bright Mr. Sun and slowly winked one of his great,  

217
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,760
goggly eyes. "There comes a foolish green 
fly," said he. "Who does he belong to?"

218
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,720
"Nobody!" snapped Little Joe. "What have 
foolish green flies got to do with my

219
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,440
—I mean our fish?"

220
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
"Nothing, nothing at all," 
replied Grandfather Frog mildly.  

221
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,960
"I was just hoping that he would come near 
enough for me to snap him up; then he would  

222
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:37,200
belong to me. As long as he doesn't, he doesn't 
belong to any one. I suppose that if Buster Bear  

223
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,840
should happen along and catch him, he would 
be stealing from me, according to Little Joe."

224
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,400
"Of course not! What a silly idea! 
You're getting foolish in your old age,"

225
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,080
retorted Little Joe.

226
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,720
"Can you tell me the difference between 
the fish that you haven't caught  

227
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,520
and the foolish green flies that I 
haven't caught?" asked Grandfather Frog.

228
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,440
Little Joe couldn't find a word to say.

229
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,280
"You take my advice, Little Joe 
Otter," continued Grandfather Frog,  

230
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,720
"and always make friends with those who are 
bigger and stronger and smarter than you are.

231
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,680
You'll find it pays."

232
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,600
Illus You take my advice, Little Joe 
Otter, continued Grandfather Frog.

233
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:21,754
You take my advice, Little Joe Otter, continued

234
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:21,840
Grandfather Frog. Page 26.

235
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,720
CHAPTER VI

236
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,560
LITTLE JOE OTTER TAKES GRANDFATHER

237
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,520
FROG'S ADVICE

238
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,800
Who makes an enemy a friend,

239
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,120
To fear and worry puts an end.

240
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,480
Little Joe Otter found that out when 
he took Grandfather Frog's advice.  

241
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,160
He wouldn't have admitted that he was afraid 
of Buster Bear. No one ever likes to admit  

242
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,640
being afraid, least of all Little Joe Otter. And 
really Little Joe has a great deal of courage.  

243
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,640
Very few of the little people of the Green Forest 
or the Green Meadows would willingly quarrel with  

244
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,440
him, for Little Joe is a great fighter when he has 
to fight. As for all those who live in or along  

245
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,360
the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool, they 
let Little Joe have his own way in everything.

246
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:20,000
Now having one's own way too much is a bad thing. 
It is apt to make one selfish and thoughtless  

247
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,840
of other people and very hard to get along with. 
Little Joe Otter had his way too much. Grandfather  

248
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,520
Frog knew it and shook his head very soberly 
when Little Joe had been disrespectful to him.

249
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:42,960
"Too bad. Too bad! Too bad! Chug-a-rum! It is too 
bad that such a fine young fellow as Little Joe  

250
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,120
should spoil a good disposition 
by such selfish heedlessness.

251
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,840
Too bad," said he.

252
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,040
So, though he didn't let on 
that it was so, Grandfather Frog  

253
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,720
really was delighted when he heard how Buster 
Bear had been too smart for Little Joe Otter.  

254
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,560
It tickled him so that he had 
hard work to keep a straight face.  

255
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,520
But he did and was as grave and solemn 
as you please as he advised Little Joe  

256
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,400
always to make friends with any one who was 
bigger and stronger and smarter than he.  

257
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,000
That was good common sense advice, but Little Joe 
just sniffed and went off declaring that he would  

258
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,360
get even with Buster Bear yet. Now Little Joe is 
good-natured and full of fun as a rule, and after  

259
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,600
he had reached home and his temper had cooled off 
a little, he began to see the joke on himself,—how  

260
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:44,080
when he had worked so hard to frighten the fish 
in the little pools of the Laughing Brook so that  

261
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,120
Buster Bear should not catch any, he had all the 
time been driving them right into Buster's paws.  

262
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,120
By and by he grinned. It was a little 
sheepish grin at first, but at last it

263
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,560
grew into a laugh.

264
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,400
"I believe," said Little Joe as he 
wiped tears of laughter from his eyes,  

265
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,040
"that Grandfather Frog is right, 
and that the best thing I can do  

266
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,360
is to make friends with Buster Bear. 
I'll try it to-morrow morning."

267
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,480
So very early the next morning Little Joe Otter 
went to the best fishing pool he knew of in the  

268
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,680
Laughing Brook, and there he caught the biggest 
trout he could find. It was so big and fat that  

269
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,760
it made Little Joe's mouth water, for you know 
fat trout are his favorite food. But he didn't  

270
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:43,120
take so much as one bite. Instead he carefully 
laid it on an old log where Buster Bear would  

271
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,120
be sure to see it if he should come along that 
way. Then he hid near by, where he could watch.  

272
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,480
Buster was late that morning. It seemed to 
Little Joe that he never would come. Once  

273
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,240
he nearly lost the fish. He had turned his head 
for just a minute, and when he looked back again,  

274
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,760
the trout was nowhere to be seen. Buster 
couldn't have stolen up and taken it,  

275
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
because such a big fellow couldn't 
possibly have gotten out of sight again.

276
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Little Joe darted over to the 
log and looked on the other side.  

277
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,080
There was the fat trout, and there also was 
Little Joe's smallest cousin, Shadow the Weasel,  

278
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,720
who is a great thief and altogether 
bad. Little Joe sprang at him angrily,  

279
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,800
but Shadow was too quick and darted away. Little 
Joe put the fish back on the log and waited.

280
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,120
This time he didn't take his eyes off it. At 
last, when he was almost ready to give up, he saw  

281
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,640
Buster Bear shuffling along towards the Laughing 
Brook. Suddenly Buster stopped and sniffed.  

282
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,160
One of the Merry Little Breezes had carried the 
scent of that fat trout over to him. Then he came  

283
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,480
straight over to where the fish lay, his nose 
wrinkling, and his eyes twinkling with pleasure.

284
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,520
"Now I wonder who was so thoughtful  

285
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,480
as to leave this fine breakfast 
ready for me," said he out loud.

286
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,760
"Me," said Little Joe in a rather faint 
voice. "I caught it especially for you."

287
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,040
"Thank you," replied Buster,  

288
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,400
and his eyes twinkled more than ever. 
"I think we are going to be friends."

289
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,600
"I—I hope so," replied Little Joe.

290
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,320
CHAPTER VII

291
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAS NO LUCK

292
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,400
AT ALL

293
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,280
Farmer Brown's boy tramped through the Green 
Forest, whistling merrily. He always whistles  

294
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,520
when he feels light-hearted, and he always 
feels light-hearted when he goes fishing.  

295
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,200
You see, he is just as fond of fishing 
as is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink  

296
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,120
or Buster Bear. And now he was making his way 
through the Green Forest to the Laughing Brook,  

297
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,480
sure that by the time he had followed it down 
to the Smiling Pool he would have a fine lot of  

298
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,320
trout to take home. He knew every pool in the 
Laughing Brook where the trout love to hide,  

299
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,120
did Farmer Brown's boy, and it was just the kind 
of a morning when the trout should be hungry.  

300
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
So he whistled as he tramped along, 
and his whistle was good to hear.

301
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,000
When he reached the first little pool he 
baited his hook very carefully and then,  

302
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,360
taking the greatest care to keep out of sight 
of any trout that might be in the little pool,  

303
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,040
he began to fish. Now Farmer Brown's boy learned 
a long time ago that to be a successful fisherman  

304
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,040
one must have a great deal of patience, so though 
he didn't get a bite right away as he had expected  

305
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,520
to, he wasn't the least bit discouraged. 
He kept very quiet and fished and fished,  

306
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
patiently waiting for a 
foolish trout to take his hook.  

307
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:14,240
But he didn't get so much as a nibble. "Either the 
trout have lost their appetite or they have grown  

308
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,120
very wise," muttered Farmer Brown's boy, as after 
a long time he moved on to the next little pool.

309
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,240
There the same thing happened. He 
was very patient, very, very patient,  

310
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:35,760
but his patience brought no reward, not so much 
as the faintest kind of a nibble. Farmer Brown's  

311
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,640
boy trudged on to the next pool, and there was a 
puzzled frown on his freckled face. Such a thing  

312
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,360
never had happened before. He didn't know what to 
make of it. All the night before he had dreamed  

313
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,280
about the delicious dinner of fried trout he would 
have the next day, and now—well, if he didn't  

314
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,560
catch some trout pretty soon, that splendid 
dinner would never be anything but a dream.

315
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,320
"If I didn't know that nobody 
else comes fishing here,  

316
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,560
I should think that somebody had been here this 
very morning and caught all the fish or else  

317
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,560
frightened them so that they are all in hiding," 
said he, as he trudged on to the next little pool.  

318
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:24,320
"I never had such bad luck in 
all my life before. Hello! What's

319
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,720
this?"

320
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,960
There, on the bank beside the little pool, were 
the heads of three trout. Farmer Brown's boy  

321
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,840
scowled down at them more puzzled than 
ever. "Somebody has been fishing here,  

322
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,680
and they have had better luck than I have," 
thought he. He looked up the Laughing Brook  

323
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,720
and down the Laughing Brook and this way and that 
way, but no one was to be seen. Then he picked up  

324
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,240
one of the little heads and looked at it 
sharply. "It wasn't cut off with a knife;  

325
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,760
it was bitten off!" he exclaimed. "I wonder now if 
Billy Mink is the scamp who has spoiled my fun."

326
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,800
Thereafter he kept a sharp 
lookout for signs of Billy Mink,  

327
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:18,080
but though he found two or three more trout heads, 
he saw no other signs and he caught no fish.  

328
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,960
This puzzled him more than ever. It didn't 
seem possible that such a little fellow as  

329
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,840
Billy Mink could have caught or frightened 
all the fish or have eaten so many.

330
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Besides, he didn't remember ever having 
known Billy to leave heads around that way.  

331
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,480
Billy sometimes catches more fish than he 
can eat, but then he usually hides them.  

332
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,840
The farther he went down the Laughing 
Brook, the more puzzled Farmer Brown's  

333
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,360
boy grew. It made him feel very queer. He 
would have felt still more queer if he had  

334
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,040
known that all the time two other fishermen 
who had been before him were watching him  

335
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,880
and chuckling to themselves. They 
were Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear.

336
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,360
CHAPTER VIII

337
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,320
FARMER BROWN'S BOY FEELS HIS

338
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,040
HAIR RISE

339
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,800
'Twas just a sudden odd surprise

340
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
Made Farmer Brown's boy's hair to rise.

341
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,560
That's a funny thing for hair to do—rise up all 
of a sudden—isn't it? But that is just what the  

342
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,640
hair on Farmer Brown's boy's head did the day he 
went fishing in the Laughing Brook and had no luck  

343
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:36,400
at all. There are just two things that make hair 
rise—anger and fear. Anger sometimes makes the  

344
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,240
hair on the back and neck of Bowser the Hound and 
of some other little people bristle and stand up,  

345
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,240
and you know the hair on the tail of Black Pussy 
stands on end until her tail looks twice as big  

346
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,360
as it really is. Both anger and fear make it do 
that. But there is only one thing that can make  

347
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,600
the hair on the head of Farmer Brown's boy rise, 
and as it isn't anger, of course it must be fear.

348
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,320
It never had happened before. You see, there 
isn't much of anything that Farmer Brown's boy is  

349
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,120
really afraid of. Perhaps he wouldn't have 
been afraid this time if it hadn't been for  

350
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,520
the surprise of what he found. You see when he 
had found the heads of those trout on the bank  

351
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,720
he knew right away that some one else had been 
fishing, and that was why he couldn't catch any;  

352
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,560
but it didn't seem possible that little 
Billy Mink could have eaten all those trout,  

353
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:37,840
and Farmer Brown's boy didn't once think of Little 
Joe Otter, and so he was very, very much puzzled.

354
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,640
He was turning it all over in his 
mind and studying what it could mean,  

355
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,240
when he came to a little muddy place 
on the bank of the Laughing Brook,  

356
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,280
and there he saw something that made his eyes 
look as if they would pop right out of his head,  

357
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,320
and it was right then that he felt his hair rise.  

358
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:04,320
Anyway, that is what he said when he told about it 
afterward. What was it he saw? What do you think?  

359
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,480
Why, it was a footprint in the soft mud. 
Yes, Sir, that's what it was, and all it was.  

360
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,720
But it was the biggest footprint Farmer 
Brown's boy ever had seen, and it looked  

361
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,920
as if it had been made only a few minutes 
before. It was the footprint of Buster Bear.

362
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,000
Now Farmer Brown's boy didn't know 
that Buster Bear had come down  

363
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,920
to the Green Forest to live. He never had 
heard of a Bear being in the Green Forest.

364
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,840
And so he was so surprised that he 
had hard work to believe his own eyes,  

365
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,880
and he had a queer feeling all over,—a little 
chilly feeling, although it was a warm day.  

366
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:00,160
Somehow, he didn't feel like meeting Buster 
Bear. If he had had his terrible gun with him,  

367
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,160
it might have been different. But he didn't, 
and so he suddenly made up his mind that he  

368
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,560
didn't want to fish any more that day. He had a 
funny feeling, too, that he was being watched,  

369
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,280
although he couldn't see any one. He 
was being watched. Little Joe Otter  

370
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,200
and Buster Bear were watching him and taking 
the greatest care to keep out of his sight.

371
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,920
All the way home through the Green Forest, 
Farmer Brown's boy kept looking behind him,  

372
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,560
and he didn't draw a long breath until 
he reached the edge of the Green Forest.  

373
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,240
He hadn't run, but he had wanted to.

374
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,320
"Huh!" said Buster Bear to Little 
Joe Otter, "I believe he was afraid!"

375
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,360
And Buster Bear was just exactly right.

376
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,760
CHAPTER IX

377
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,280
LITTLE JOE OTTER HAS GREAT NEWS

378
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,680
TO TELL

379
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,160
Little Joe Otter was fairly bursting with 
excitement. He could hardly contain himself.  

380
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,400
He felt that he had the greatest news to tell 
since Peter Rabbit had first found the tracks  

381
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,240
of Buster Bear in the Green Forest. He couldn't 
keep it to himself a minute longer than he had to.  

382
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,880
So he hurried to the Smiling Pool, where he 
was sure he would find Billy Mink and Jerry  

383
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,720
Muskrat and Grandfather Frog and Spotty 
the Turtle, and he hoped that perhaps  

384
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,400
some of the little people who live in 
the Green Forest might be there too.  

385
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,400
Sure enough, Peter Rabbit was there on one side 
of the Smiling Pool, making faces at Reddy Fox,  

386
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,280
who was on the other side, which, of 
course, was not at all nice of Peter.  

387
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,240
Mr. and Mrs. Redwing were there, and Blacky 
the Crow was sitting in the Big Hickory-tree.

388
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,720
Little Joe Otter swam straight to the Big Rock 
and climbed up to the very highest part. He looked  

389
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,640
so excited, and his eyes sparkled so, that every 
one knew right away that something had happened.

390
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,440
"Hi!" cried Billy Mink. "Look at Little Joe Otter!  

391
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,920
It must be that for once he has 
been smarter than Buster Bear."

392
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:34,240
Little Joe made a good-natured face at Billy 
Mink and shook his head. "No, Billy," said he,  

393
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,640
"you are wrong, altogether wrong. I don't 
believe anybody can be smarter than Buster Bear."

394
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,320
Illus Reddy glared across 
the Smiling Pool at Peter.

395
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Reddy Fox rolled his lips back in an 
unpleasant grin. "Don't be too sure of that!"

396
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,040
he snapped. "I'm not through with him yet."

397
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,880
"Boaster! Boaster!" cried Peter Rabbit.

398
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,480
Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter. 
"I'm not through with you either, Peter Rabbit!"  

399
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,240
he snarled. "You'll find it 
out one of these fine days!"

400
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
"Reddy, Reddy, smart and sly,

401
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
Couldn't catch a buzzing fly!"

402
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,560
taunted Peter.

403
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,560
"Chug-a-rum!" said Grandfather Frog 
in his deepest, gruffest voice.  

404
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,360
"We know all about that. What we want to know 
is what Little Joe Otter has got on his mind."

405
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,840
"It's news—great news!" cried Little Joe.

406
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,280
"We can tell better how great 
it is when we hear what it is,"  

407
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,040
replied Grandfather Frog testily. "What is it?"

408
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Little Joe Otter looked around at all the eager 
faces watching him, and then in the slowest,  

409
00:38:48,720 --> 00:39:00,240
most provoking way, he drawled: "Farmer 
Brown's boy is afraid of Buster Bear."

410
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,000
For a minute no one said a word. 
Then Blacky the Crow leaned down  

411
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,840
from his perch in the Big Hickory-tree and 
looked very hard at Little Joe as he said:

412
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,120
"I don't believe it. I don't believe a word of it.  

413
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,120
Farmer Brown's boy isn't afraid of 
any one who lives in the Green Forest  

414
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:30,080
or on the Green Meadows or in the Smiling Pool, 
and you know it. We are all afraid of him."

415
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:37,920
Little Joe glared back at Blacky. "I don't care 
whether you believe it or not; it's true," he  

416
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,400
retorted. Then he told how early that very morning 
he and Buster Bear had been fishing together in  

417
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,240
the Laughing Brook, and how Farmer Brown's boy 
had been fishing there too, and hadn't caught a  

418
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,560
single trout because they had all been caught or 
frightened before he got there. Then he told how  

419
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,720
Farmer Brown's boy had found a footprint of Buster 
Bear in the soft mud, and how he had stopped  

420
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,480
fishing right away and started for home, looking 
behind him with fear in his eyes all the way.

421
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:16,160
"Now tell me that he isn't afraid!" concluded 
Little Joe. "For once he knows just how we feel  

422
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:23,840
when he comes prowling around where we are. Isn't 
that great news? Now we'll get even with him!"

423
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,400
"I'll believe it when I see it for 
myself!" snapped Blacky the Crow.

424
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,520
CHAPTER X

425
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,600
BUSTER BEAR BECOMES A HERO

426
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,160
The news that Little Joe Otter told at the 
Smiling Pool,—how Farmer Brown's boy had  

427
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,480
run away from Buster Bear without even seeing 
him,—soon spread all over the Green Meadows and  

428
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,840
through the Green Forest, until every one 
who lives there knew about it. Of course,  

429
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,920
Peter Rabbit helped spread it. Trust Peter for 
that! But everybody else helped too. You see,  

430
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,480
they had all been afraid of Farmer Brown's boy for 
so long that they were tickled almost to pieces at  

431
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,480
the very thought of having some one in the Green 
Forest who could make Farmer Brown's boy feel fear  

432
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,440
as they had felt it. And so it was that Buster 
Bear became a hero right away to most of them.

433
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,480
A few doubted Little Joe's story. One of them was 
Blacky the Crow. Another was Reddy Fox. Blacky  

434
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,280
doubted because he knew Farmer Brown's boy so well 
that he couldn't imagine him afraid. Reddy doubted  

435
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,000
because he didn't want to believe. You see, he 
was jealous of Buster Bear, and at the same time  

436
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,080
he was afraid of him. So Reddy pretended not to 
believe a word of what Little Joe Otter had said,  

437
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:58,720
and he agreed with Blacky that only by seeing 
Farmer Brown's boy afraid could he ever be made to  

438
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,360
believe it. But nearly everybody else believed it, 
and there was great rejoicing. Most of them were  

439
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:12,800
afraid of Buster, very much afraid of him, because 
he was so big and strong. But they were still more  

440
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,520
afraid of Farmer Brown's boy, because they didn't 
know him or understand him, and because in the  

441
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,600
past he had tried to catch some of them in traps 
and had hunted some of them with his terrible gun.

442
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,680
So now they were very proud to think that one 
of their own number actually had frightened him,  

443
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:40,640
and they began to look on Buster Bear as a real 
hero. They tried in ever so many ways to show  

444
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,760
him how friendly they felt and went quite out 
of their way to do him favors. Whenever they  

445
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,880
met one another, all they could talk about was 
the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear.

446
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,240
"Now I guess Farmer Brown's boy will 
keep away from the Green Forest,  

447
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,800
and we won't have to be all the time 
watching out for him," said Bobby Coon,  

448
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,840
as he washed his dinner in the Laughing Brook, 
for you know he is very neat and particular.

449
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,200
"And he won't dare set any more 
traps for me," gloated Billy Mink.

450
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,720
"Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown's 
henhouse and scare Farmer Brown's boy so that  

451
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,880
he would keep away from there. It would be a 
favor to me which Ah cert'nly would appreciate,"  

452
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,320
said Unc' Billy Possum when he heard the news.

453
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,840
"Let's all go together and tell Buster Bear 
how much obliged we are for what he has done,"  

454
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,840
proposed Jerry Muskrat.

455
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,720
"That's a splendid idea!" cried Little 
Joe Otter. "We'll do it right away."

456
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,040
"Caw, caw caw!"  

457
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,080
broke in Blacky the Crow. "I say, let's wait 
and see for ourselves if it is all true."

458
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,080
"Of course it's true!" snapped Little Joe Otter. 
"Don't you believe I'm telling the truth?"

459
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,520
"Certainly, certainly. Of course no one doubts 
your word," replied Blacky, with the utmost  

460
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,880
politeness. "But you say yourself that Farmer 
Brown's boy didn't see Buster Bear, but only his  

461
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:23,040
footprint. Perhaps he didn't know whose it was, 
and if he had he wouldn't have been afraid. Now  

462
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,920
I've got a plan by which we can see for 
ourselves if he really is afraid of Buster Bear."

463
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,440
"What is it?" asked Sammy Jay eagerly.

464
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:42,320
Blacky the Crow shook his head and winked. "That's 
telling," said he. "I want to think it over.  

465
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,720
If you meet me at the Big Hickory-tree 
at sun-up to-morrow morning,  

466
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,080
and get everybody else to come that 
you can, perhaps I will tell you."

467
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,720
CHAPTER XI

468
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,120
BLACKY THE CROW TELLS HIS PLAN

469
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,000
Blacky is a dreamer!

470
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,320
Blacky is a schemer!

471
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,680
His voice is strong;

472
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,880
When things go wrong

473
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,360
Blacky is a screamer!

474
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,040
It's a fact. Blacky the Crow is forever 
dreaming and scheming and almost always  

475
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,760
it is of mischief. He is one of the smartest 
and cleverest of all the little people of the  

476
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,920
Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and all 
the others know it. Blacky likes excitement.  

477
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,360
He wants something going on. The more 
exciting it is, the better he likes it.  

478
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,480
Then he has a chance to use that harsh 
voice of his, and how he does use it!

479
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,040
So now, as he sat in the top of the Big 
Hickory-tree beside the Smiling Pool and  

480
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,200
looked down on all the little people 
gathered there, he was very happy.  

481
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:56,080
In the first place he felt very important, and 
you know Blacky dearly loves to feel important.  

482
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,080
They had all come at his invitation to listen 
to a plan for seeing for themselves if it were  

483
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,680
really true that Farmer Brown's 
boy was afraid of Buster Bear.

484
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:13,520
On the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool sat Little Joe 
Otter, Billy Mink, and Jerry Muskrat. On his big,  

485
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,840
green lily-pad sat Grandfather Frog. On 
another lily-pad sat Spotty the Turtle.  

486
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,240
On the bank on one side of the Smiling Pool 
were Peter Rabbit, Jumper the Hare, Danny  

487
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,760
Meadow Mouse, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, Unc' 
Billy Possum, Striped Chipmunk and Old Mr. Toad.  

488
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:42,080
On the other side of the Smiling Pool were Reddy 
Fox, Digger the Badger, and Bobby Coon. In the Big  

489
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,760
Hickory-tree were Chatterer the Red Squirrel, 
Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and Sammy Jay.

490
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,320
Blacky waited until he was sure 
that no one else was coming.  

491
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:59,120
Then he cleared his throat very loudly 
and began to speak. "Friends," said he.

492
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,320
Everybody grinned, for Blacky has played so many 
sharp tricks that no one is really his friend  

493
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,920
unless it is that other 
mischief-maker, Sammy Jay, who, you

494
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,520
know, is Blacky's cousin. But no one 
said anything, and Blacky went on.

495
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:23,200
"Little Joe Otter has told us how he saw Farmer 
Brown's boy hurry home when he found the footprint  

496
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,280
of Buster Bear on the edge of the Laughing Brook, 
and how all the way he kept looking behind him,  

497
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:36,720
as if he were afraid. Perhaps he was, and 
then again perhaps he wasn't. Perhaps he had  

498
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:43,360
something else on his mind. You have made a hero 
of Buster Bear, because you believe Little Joe's  

499
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:51,040
story. Now I don't say that I don't believe it, 
but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that  

500
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:58,880
Farmer Brown's boy is afraid of Buster when I 
see him run away myself. Now here is my plan:

501
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,720
"To-morrow morning, very early, Sammy Jay and 
I will make a great fuss near the edge of the  

502
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,920
Green Forest. Farmer Brown's boy has a lot of 
curiosity, and he will be sure to come over  

503
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:22,160
to see what it is all about. Then we will lead 
him to where Buster Bear is. If he runs away, I  

504
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,280
will be the first to admit that Buster Bear is as 
great a hero as some of you seem to think he is.  

505
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,960
It is a very simple plan, and if you 
will all hide where you can watch,  

506
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,920
you will be able to see for yourselves if 
Little Joe Otter is right. Now what do you say?"

507
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,800
Right away everybody began to talk at the 
same time. It was such a simple plan that  

508
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,400
everybody agreed to it. And it promised to be 
so exciting that everybody promised to be there,  

509
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,400
that is, everybody but Grandfather Frog and 
Spotty the Turtle, who didn't care to go so far  

510
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:06,080
away from the Smiling Pool. So it was agreed that 
Blacky should try his plan the very next morning.

511
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,640
CHAPTER XII

512
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,760
FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND BUSTER

513
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,320
BEAR GROW CURIOUS

514
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,640
Ever since it was light enough to see at 
all, Blacky the Crow had been sitting in  

515
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,160
the top of the tallest tree on the edge of the 
Green Forest nearest to Farmer Brown's house,  

516
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,240
and never for an instant had he taken his 
eyes from Farmer Brown's back door. What was  

517
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:39,600
he watching for? Why, for Farmer Brown's boy to 
come out on his way to milk the cows. Meanwhile,  

518
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,040
Sammy Jay was slipping silently through the 
Green Forest, looking for Buster Bear, so that  

519
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,480
when the time came he could let his cousin, 
Blacky the Crow, know just where Buster was.

520
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,040
By and by the back door of 
Farmer Brown's house opened,  

521
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,920
and out stepped Farmer Brown's boy. 
In each hand he carried a milk pail.  

522
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:08,240
Right away Blacky began to scream at 
the top of his lungs. "Caw, caw, caw!"  

523
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:16,480
shouted Blacky. "Caw, caw, caw!" And all the 
time he flew about among the trees near the  

524
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,000
edge of the Green Forest as if so excited 
that he couldn't keep still. Farmer Brown's  

525
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,200
boy looked over there as if he wondered what 
all that fuss was about, as indeed he did,  

526
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,960
but he didn't start to go over and see. 
No, Sir, he started straight for the barn.

527
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,880
Blacky didn't know what to make of it. You see, 
smart as he is and shrewd as he is, Blacky doesn't  

528
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,120
know anything about the meaning of duty, for he 
never has to work excepting to get enough to eat.  

529
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,000
So, when Farmer Brown's boy started for 
the barn instead of for the Green Forest,  

530
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,840
Blacky didn't know what to make of it.

531
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,640
He screamed harder and louder than ever, until his 
voice grew so hoarse he couldn't scream any more,  

532
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,400
but Farmer Brown's boy kept right on to the barn.

533
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,160
"I'd like to know what you're 
making such a fuss about, Mr. Crow,  

534
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,000
but I've got to feed the cows 
and milk them first," said he.

535
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,680
Now all this time the other little people 
of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows  

536
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,240
had been hiding where they could see all 
that went on. When Farmer Brown's boy  

537
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,880
disappeared in the barn, Chatterer the 
Red Squirrel snickered right out loud.  

538
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,320
"Ha, ha, ha! This is a great plan of yours, 
Blacky! Ha, ha, ha!" he shouted. Blacky  

539
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,760
couldn't find a word to say. He just hung his 
head, which is something Blacky seldom does.

540
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,720
"Perhaps if we wait until he comes 
out again, he will come over here,"  

541
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,680
said Sammy Jay, who had joined Blacky. So it was 
decided to wait. It seemed as if Farmer Brown's  

542
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:58,320
boy never would come out, but at last he did. 
Blacky and Sammy Jay at once began to scream  

543
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,840
and make all the fuss they could. Farmer Brown's 
boy took the two pails of milk into the house,  

544
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,000
then out he came and started 
straight for the Green Forest.  

545
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,920
He was so curious to know what it all 
meant that he couldn't wait another minute.

546
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,960
Now there was some one else with 
a great deal of curiosity also.  

547
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,680
He had heard the screaming of 
Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay,  

548
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,440
and he had listened until he couldn't stand 
it another minute. He just had to know what  

549
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,520
it was all about. So at the same time Farmer 
Brown's boy started for the Green Forest,  

550
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:35,200
this other listener started towards the place 
where Blacky and Sammy were making such a racket.  

551
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,440
He walked very softly so as not to 
make a sound. It was Buster Bear.

552
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:50,240
CHAPTER XIII

553
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,520
FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND BUSTER

554
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,400
BEAR MEET

555
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,000
If you should meet with Buster Bear

556
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,360
While walking through the wood,

557
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,320
What would you do? Now tell me true,

558
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,880
I'd run the best I could.

559
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,600
That is what Farmer Brown's boy 
did when he met Buster Bear,  

560
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,480
and a lot of the little people of the Green 
Forest and some from the Green Meadows saw him.

561
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,400
When Farmer Brown's boy came hurrying home from 
the Laughing Brook without any fish one day  

562
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,040
and told about the great footprint he had 
seen in a muddy place on the bank deep  

563
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,240
in the Green Forest, and had said his was 
sure that it was the footprint of a Bear,  

564
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,600
he had been laughed at. Farmer 
Brown had laughed and laughed.

565
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,280
"Why," said he, "there hasn't been a Bear in the 
Green Forest for years and years and years, not  

566
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,680
since my own grandfather was a little boy, and 
that, you know, was a long, long, long time ago.  

567
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:56,160
If you want to find Mr. Bear, you will have to 
go to the Great Woods. I don't know who made  

568
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,600
that footprint, but it certainly couldn't have 
been a Bear. I think you must have imagined it."

569
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,640
Then he had laughed some more, all of which 
goes to show how easy it is to be mistaken,  

570
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,200
and how foolish it is to laugh at 
things you really don't know about.

571
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,640
Buster Bear had come to live in the Green Forest, 
and Farmer Brown's boy had seen his footprint.  

572
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,520
But Farmer Brown laughed so much 
and made fun of him so much,  

573
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,000
that at last his boy began to think that 
he must have been mistaken after all.  

574
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,680
So when he heard Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay 
making a great fuss near the edge of the Green  

575
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,680
Forest, he never once thought of Buster Bear, 
as he started over to see what was going on.

576
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,400
When Blacky and Sammy saw him coming, they 
moved a little farther in to the Green Forest,  

577
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,040
still screaming in the most excited way. They felt 
sure that Farmer Brown's boy would follow them,  

578
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,120
and they meant to lead him to where 
Sammy had seen Buster Bear that morning.  

579
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,560
Then they would find out for sure if what

580
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:09,200
Little Joe Otter had said was true,—that Farmer 
Brown's boy really was afraid of Buster Bear.

581
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:17,440
Now all around, behind trees and stumps, and under 
thick branches, and even in tree tops, were other  

582
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:24,800
little people watching with round, wide-open eyes 
to see what would happen. It was very exciting,  

583
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,560
the most exciting thing they could remember. You 
see, they had come to believe that Farmer Brown's  

584
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,560
boy wasn't afraid of anybody or anything, and 
as most of them were very much afraid of him,  

585
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:42,080
they had hard work to believe that he would 
really be afraid of even such a great, big,  

586
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:47,840
strong fellow as Buster Bear. Every one 
was so busy watching Farmer Brown's boy  

587
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,840
that no one saw Buster coming 
from the other direction.

588
00:55:52,720 --> 00:56:00,320
You see, Buster walked very softly. Big as he is, 
he can walk without making the teeniest, weeniest  

589
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:07,760
sound. And that is how it happened that no one saw 
him or heard him until just as Farmer Brown's boy  

590
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:15,120
stepped out from behind one side of a thick little 
hemlock-tree, Buster Bear stepped out from behind  

591
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:24,000
the other side of that same little tree, and there 
they were face to face! Then everybody held their  

592
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,480
breath, even Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay. 
For just a little minute it was so still there  

593
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,240
in the Green Forest that not the least little 
sound could be heard. What was going to happen?

594
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,200
CHAPTER XIV

595
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,240
A SURPRISING THING HAPPENS

596
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,760
Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, looking down from 
the top of a tall tree, held their breath. Happy  

597
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,360
Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin, Chatterer 
the Red Squirrel, looking down from another tree,  

598
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:04,240
held their breath. Unc' Billy Possum, sticking 
his head out from a hollow tree, held his breath.  

599
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,520
Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in 
a hollow stump in which he was hiding,  

600
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:18,560
held his breath. Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind 
a heap of brush, held his breath. Peter Rabbit,  

601
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:26,000
sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch, 
with eyes and ears wide open, held his breath.  

602
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,840
And all the other little people who happened 
to be where they could see did the same thing.

603
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,000
You see, it was the most exciting 
moment ever was in the Green Forest.  

604
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,000
Farmer Brown's boy had just 
stepped out from behind one side  

605
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,520
of a little hemlock-tree and Buster Bear had 
just stepped out from behind the opposite side  

606
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,840
of the little hemlock-tree and neither had 
known that the other was anywhere near. For  

607
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:58,000
a whole minute they stood there face to face, 
gazing into each other's eyes, while everybody  

608
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,840
watched and waited, and it seemed as if the 
whole Green Forest was holding its breath.

609
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:12,960
Then something happened. Yes, Sir, something 
happened. Farmer Brown's boy opened his mouth  

610
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:20,880
and yelled! It was such a sudden yell and such 
a loud yell that it startled Chatterer so that  

611
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,360
he nearly fell from his place in the tree, and it 
made Reddy Fox jump to his feet ready to run. And  

612
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:35,600
that yell was a yell of fright. There was no doubt 
about it, for with the yell Farmer Brown's boy  

613
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:42,800
turned and ran for home, as no one ever had seen 
him run before. He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs  

614
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,240
when he has got to reach the dear Old Briar-patch 
before Reddy Fox can catch him, which, you know,  

615
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:54,560
is as fast as he can run. Once he stumbled and 
fell, but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling,  

616
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:59,200
and away he went without once turning his 
head to see if Buster Bear was after him.  

617
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,240
There wasn't any doubt that he 
was afraid, very much afraid.

618
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,600
Everybody leaned forward to watch him. 
"What did I tell you? Didn't I say that  

619
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,400
he was afraid of Buster Bear?" cried Little 
Joe Otter, dancing about with excitement.

620
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:25,280
"You were right, Little Joe! I'm sorry that 
I doubted it. See him go! Caw, caw, caw!"  

621
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,640
shrieked Blacky the Crow.

622
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,840
For a minute or two everybody forgot about Buster 
Bear. Then there was a great crash which made  

623
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:41,360
everybody turn to look the other way. What do you 
think they saw? Why, Buster Bear was running away  

624
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:47,360
too, and he was running twice as fast as Farmer 
Brown's boy! He bumped into trees and crashed  

625
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:54,560
through bushes and jumped over logs, and in almost 
no time at all he was out of sight. Altogether it  

626
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:59,840
was the most surprising thing that the little 
people of the Green Forest ever had seen.

627
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,320
Illus Buster Bear was running away, too

628
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,160
Sammy Jay looked at Blacky the Crow, and Blacky 
looked at Chatterer, and Chatterer looked at Happy  

629
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:12,480
Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Peter Rabbit, and 
Peter looked at Unc' Billy Possum, and Unc' Billy  

630
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,960
looked at Bobby Coon, and Bobby looked at 
Johnny Chuck, and Johnny looked at Reddy Fox,  

631
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,640
and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk, and Jimmy 
looked at Billy Mink, and Billy looked at Little  

632
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:33,360
Joe Otter, and for a minute nobody could say a 
word. Then Little Joe gave a funny little gasp.

633
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,560
"Why, why-e-e!" said he,  

634
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:44,720
"I believe Buster Bear is afraid too!" 
Unc' Billy Possum chuckled. "Ah believe  

635
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:51,760
yo' are right again, Brer Otter," said he. "It 
cert'nly does look so. If Brer Bear isn't scared,  

636
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,600
he must have remembered something impo'tant and 
has gone to attend to it in a powerful hurry."

637
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,280
Then everybody began to laugh.

638
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,760
CHAPTER XV

639
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,080
BUSTER BEAR IS A FALLEN HERO

640
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:16,000
A fallen hero is some one to whom every one has 
looked up as very brave and then proves to be less  

641
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,040
brave than he was supposed to be. That was the way 
with Buster Bear. When Little Joe Otter had told  

642
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:30,080
how Farmer Brown's boy had been afraid at the mere 
sight of one of Buster Bear's big footprints, they  

643
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:37,200
had at once made a hero of Buster. At least some 
of them had. As this was the first time, the very  

644
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,800
first time, that they had ever known any one who 
lives in the Green Forest to make Farmer Brown's  

645
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:49,360
boy run away, they looked on Buster Bear with a 
great deal of respect and were very proud of him.

646
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:55,040
But now they had seen Buster Bear and 
Farmer Brown's boy meet face to face;  

647
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,520
and while it was true that Farmer Brown's boy had 
run away as fast as ever he could, it was also  

648
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:08,640
true that Buster Bear had done the same thing. 
He had run even faster than Farmer Brown's boy,  

649
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,720
and had hidden in the most lonely place he could 
find in the very deepest part of the Green Forest.  

650
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,480
It was hard to believe, but it was true. And right 
away everybody lost a great deal of the respect  

651
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,680
for Buster which they had felt. It is always that 
way. They began to say unkind things about him.  

652
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,720
They said them among themselves, and some of them  

653
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,280
even said them to Buster when they met him, 
or said them so that he would hear them.

654
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:42,800
Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy 
Jay, who, because they can fly,  

655
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,840
have nothing to fear from Buster, and who always 
delight in making other people uncomfortable,  

656
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,360
never let a chance go by to tell Buster 
and everybody else within hearing  

657
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:58,320
what they thought of him. They delighted 
in flying about through the Green Forest  

658
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:04,320
until they had found Buster Bear and then from 
the safety of the tree tops screaming at him.

659
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,680
"Buster Bear is big and strong;

660
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,960
His teeth are big; his claws are long;

661
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,280
In spite of these he runs away

662
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,840
And hides himself the livelong day!"

663
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,200
A dozen times a day Buster 
would hear them screaming this.  

664
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,520
He would grind his teeth and glare up at them, but 
that was all he could do. He couldn't get at them.

665
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,840
He just had to stand it and do nothing. But when 
impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted  

666
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:41,120
the same thing from a place just out of reach in a 
big pine-tree, Buster could stand it no longer. He  

667
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:47,760
gave a deep, angry growl that made little shivers 
run over Chatterer, and then suddenly he started  

668
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,600
up that tree after Chatterer. With a frightened 
little shriek Chatterer scampered to the top of  

669
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:00,320
the tree. He hadn't known that Buster could climb. 
But Buster is a splendid climber, especially when  

670
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:08,000
the tree is big and stout as this one was, and 
now he went up after Chatterer, growling angrily.

671
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:15,440
How Chatterer did wish that he had kept his 
tongue still! He ran to the very top of the tree,  

672
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,440
so frightened that his teeth chattered, 
and when he looked down and saw Buster's  

673
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:26,080
great mouth coming nearer and nearer, he nearly 
tumbled down with terror. The worst of it was  

674
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,360
there wasn't another tree near 
enough for him to jump to.  

675
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:36,320
He was in trouble this time, was Chatterer, 
sure enough! And there was no one to help him.

676
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,840
CHAPTER XVI

677
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,320
CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL JUMPS

678
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,120
FOR HIS LIFE

679
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,120
It isn't very often that Chatterer the Red 
Squirrel knows fear. That is one reason that  

680
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,040
he is so often impudent and saucy. But once in 
a while a great fear takes possession of him,  

681
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,960
as when he knows that Shadow 
the Weasel is looking for him.

682
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,800
You see, he knows that Shadow 
can go wherever he can go.  

683
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,680
There are very few of the little people of 
the Green Forest and the Green Meadows who  

684
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,920
do not know fear at some time or other, but 
it comes to Chatterer as seldom as to any one,  

685
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,920
because he is very sure of himself and his 
ability to hide or run away from danger.

686
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,920
But now as he clung to a little branch near 
the top of a tall pine-tree in the Green Forest  

687
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,400
and looked down at the big sharp teeth of Buster 
Bear drawing nearer and nearer, and listened to  

688
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:41,680
the deep, angry growls that made his hair stand 
on end, Chatterer was too frightened to think. If  

689
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:47,680
only he had kept his tongue still instead of 
saying hateful things to Buster Bear! If only  

690
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,840
he had known that Buster could climb a tree! If 
only he had chosen a tree near enough to other  

691
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:00,640
trees for him to jump across! But he had said 
hateful things, he had chosen to sit in a tree  

692
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:07,920
which stood quite by itself, and Buster Bear could 
climb! Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble,  

693
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,760
and there was no one to blame but himself. That is 
usually the case with those who get into trouble.

694
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:20,160
Nearer and nearer came Buster Bear, and 
deeper and angrier sounded his voice.

695
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:26,160
Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp 
and looked this way and looked that way.

696
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,800
What should he do? What could he do! The 
ground seemed a terrible distance below.  

697
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,760
If only he had wings like 
Sammy Jay! But he hadn't.

698
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:47,200
"Gr-r-r-r!" growled Buster Bear. "I'll teach 
you manners! I'll teach you to treat your  

699
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:53,480
betters with respect! I'll swallow you 
whole, that's what I'll do. Gr-r-r-r!"

700
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,920
"Oh!" cried Chatterer.

701
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:05,040
"Gr-r-r-r! I'll eat you all 
up to the last hair on your  

702
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,640
tail!" growled Buster, scrambling a little nearer.

703
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,280
"Oh! Oh!" cried Chatterer, and ran out to the 
very tip of the little branch to which he had  

704
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:21,600
been clinging. Now if Chatterer had only known 
it, Buster Bear couldn't reach him way up there,  

705
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:27,360
because the tree was too small at the top for such 
a big fellow as Buster. But Chatterer didn't think  

706
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:34,640
of that. He gave one more frightened look down at 
those big teeth, then he shut his eyes and jumped—

707
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,840
jumped straight out for the far-away ground.

708
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,960
It was a long, long, long way down to the 
ground, and it certainly looked as if such a  

709
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,360
little fellow as Chatterer must be killed. But 
Chatterer had learned from Old Mother Nature  

710
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,680
that she had given him certain things 
to help him at just such times,  

711
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,880
and one of them is the power to spread 
himself very flat. He did it now.

712
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:07,360
He spread his arms and legs out just as far as he 
could, and that kept him from falling as fast and  

713
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:13,760
as hard as he otherwise would have done, because 
being spread out so flat that way, the air held  

714
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:20,240
him up a little. And then there was his tail, that 
funny little tail he is so fond of jerking when he  

715
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:27,120
scolds. This helped him too. It helped him keep 
his balance and keep from turning over and over.

716
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:35,840
Down, down, down he sailed and landed on his 
feet. Of course, he hit the ground pretty hard,  

717
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,120
and for just a second he quite lost his 
breath. But it was only for a second,  

718
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,200
and then he was scurrying off as 
fast as a frightened Squirrel could.

719
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,720
Buster Bear watched him and grinned.

720
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,640
"I didn't catch him that time," he growled,  

721
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:57,840
"but I guess I gave him a good 
fright and taught him a lesson."

722
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:07,360
CHAPTER XVII

723
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,480
BUSTER BEAR GOES BERRYING

724
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:21,440
Buster Bear is a great hand to talk to himself 
when he thinks no one is around to overhear.  

725
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,880
It's a habit. However, it isn't a bad 
habit unless it is carried too far.  

726
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:34,640
Any habit becomes bad, if it is carried too 
far. Suppose you had a secret, a real secret,  

727
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,480
something that nobody else knew and that 
you didn't want anybody else to know.

728
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,920
And suppose you had the 
habit of talking to yourself.  

729
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:49,360
You might, without thinking, you know, tell that 
secret out loud to yourself, and some one might,  

730
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,840
just might happen to overhear! 
Then there wouldn't be any secret.  

731
01:09:54,720 --> 01:10:02,000
That is the way that a habit which isn't bad in 
itself can become bad when it is carried too far.

732
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,200
Now Buster Bear had lived by himself in 
the Great Woods so long that this habit  

733
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,880
of talking to himself had grown and grown. 
He did it just to keep from being lonesome.  

734
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,480
Of course, when he came down to the Green 
Forest to live, he brought all his habits  

735
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,160
with him. That is one thing about habits,—you 
always take them with you wherever you go.  

736
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,680
So Buster brought this habit of talking 
to himself down to the Green Forest,  

737
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,960
where he had many more neighbors 
than he had in the Great Woods.

738
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:41,360
"Let me see, let me see, what 
is there to tempt my appetite?"  

739
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:49,440
said Buster in his deep, grumbly-rumbly voice. 
"I find my appetite isn't what it ought to be.  

740
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:59,200
I need a change. Yes, Sir, I need a change. There 
is something I ought to have at this time of year,  

741
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:07,000
and I haven't got it. There is something 
that I used to have and don't have now. Ha!  

742
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:19,440
I know! I need some fresh fruit. That's 
it—fresh fruit! It must be about berry time now,  

743
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:27,120
and I'd forgotten all about it. My, my, 
my, how good some berries would taste!  

744
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:34,360
Now if I were back up there in the Great 
Woods I could have all I could eat. Um-m-m-m!  

745
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,120
Makes my mouth water just to think of it.

746
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,640
There ought to be some up in the Old 
Pasture. There ought to be a lot of  

747
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,640
'em up there. If I wasn't afraid that 
some one would see me, I'd go up there."

748
01:11:52,240 --> 01:12:00,320
Buster sighed. Then he sighed again. The 
more he thought about those berries he felt  

749
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:06,880
sure were growing in the Old Pasture, the 
more he wanted some. It seemed to him that  

750
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:13,680
never in all his life had he wanted berries 
as he did now. He wandered about uneasily.  

751
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,200
He was hungry—hungry for berries and nothing else.

752
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,600
By and by he began talking to himself again.

753
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:31,120
"If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go 
up to the Old Pasture this very minute.

754
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,320
Seems as if I could taste those berries." 
He licked his lips hungrily as he spoke.

755
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,720
Then his face brightened. "I know what 
I'll do! I'll go up there at the very  

756
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:51,520
first peep of day to-morrow. I can eat all 
I want and get back to the Green Forest  

757
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:58,240
before there is any danger that Farmer Brown's 
boy or any one else I'm afraid of will see me.  

758
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:06,160
That's just what I'll do. My, I wish 
to-morrow morning would hurry up and come."

759
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:14,720
Now though Buster didn't know it, some one 
had been listening, and that some one was  

760
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:22,560
none other than Sammy Jay. When at last Buster 
lay down for a nap, Sammy flew away, chuckling  

761
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:29,600
to himself. "I believe I'll visit the Old 
Pasture to-morrow morning myself," thought he. "I  

762
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,960
have an idea that something interesting may 
happen if Buster doesn't change his mind."

763
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,080
Sammy was on the lookout very early the next 
morning. The first Jolly Little Sunbeams had  

764
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,920
only reached the Green Meadows and had not started 
to creep into the Green Forest, when he saw a big,  

765
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,720
dark form steal out of the Green 
Forest where it joins the Old Pasture.  

766
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,360
It moved very swiftly and 
silently, as if in a great hurry.  

767
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,080
Sammy knew who it was: it was Buster 
Bear, and he was going berrying.

768
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:11,840
Sammy waited a little until he could see 
better. Then he too started for the Old Pasture.

769
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,560
CHAPTER XVIII

770
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,160
SOMEBODY ELSE GOES BERRYING

771
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,400
Isn't it funny how two people will often 
think of the same thing at the same time,  

772
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:32,080
and neither one know that the other is thinking of 
it? That is just what happened the day that Buster  

773
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:38,000
Bear first thought of going berrying. While he 
was walking around in the Green Forest, talking to  

774
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,840
himself about how hungry he was for some berries 
and how sure he was that there must be some up  

775
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:50,000
in the Old Pasture, some one else was thinking 
about berries and about the Old Pasture too.

776
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,240
"Will you make me a berry pie if 
I will get the berries to-morrow?"  

777
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,120
asked Farmer Brown's boy of his mother.

778
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,320
Of course Mrs. Brown promised that she would, 
and so that night Farmer Brown's boy went to bed  

779
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,760
very early that he might get up early in the 
morning, and all night long he dreamed of berries  

780
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:17,680
and berry pies. He was awake even before jolly, 
round, red Mr. Sun thought it was time to get up,  

781
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:23,600
and he was all ready to start for the Old Pasture 
when the first Jolly Little Sunbeams came dancing  

782
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:30,240
across the Green Meadows. He carried a big tin 
pail, and in the bottom of it, wrapped up in a  

783
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:38,000
piece of paper, was a lunch, for he meant to stay 
until he filled that pail, if it took all day.

784
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,280
Now the Old Pasture is very large. It 
lies at the foot of the Big Mountain,  

785
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,640
and even extends a little way up on the Big 
Mountain. There is room in it for many people  

786
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:54,640
to pick berries all day without even seeing each 
other, unless they roam about a great deal. You  

787
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,440
see, the bushes grow very thick there, and 
you cannot see very far in any direction.  

788
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:05,920
Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had climbed a little 
way up in the sky by the time Farmer Brown's  

789
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:11,760
boy reached the Old Pasture, and was smiling 
down on all the Great World, and all the Great  

790
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:18,240
World seemed to be smiling back. Farmer Brown's 
boy started to whistle, and then he stopped.

791
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,480
"If I whistle," thought he, 
"everybody will know just where I am,  

792
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,440
and will keep out of sight, and I never can get 
acquainted with folks if they keep out of sight."

793
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,160
You see, Farmer Brown's boy was 
just beginning to understand  

794
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,400
something that Peter Rabbit and the 
other little people of the Green Meadows  

795
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,680
and the Green Forest learned almost as soon as 
they learned to walk,—that if you don't want to

796
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:50,320
be seen, you mustn't be heard. So he didn't 
whistle as he felt like doing, and he tried not to  

797
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,760
make a bit of noise as he followed an old cow-path 
towards a place where he knew the berries grew  

798
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:02,560
thick and oh, so big, and all the time he kept 
his eyes wide open, and he kept his ears open too.

799
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,960
That is how he happened to hear a little cry, a 
very faint little cry. If he had been whistling,  

800
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,560
he wouldn't have heard it at all. He stopped 
to listen. He never had heard a cry just like  

801
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:23,040
it before. At first he couldn't make out just what 
it was or where it came from. But one thing he was  

802
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:31,680
sure of, and that was that it was a cry of fright. 
He stood perfectly still and listened with all his  

803
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:42,560
might. There it was again—"Help! Help! Help"—and 
it was very faint and sounded terribly frightened.  

804
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:49,920
He waited a minute or two, but heard nothing more. 
Then he put down his pail and began a hurried look  

805
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:55,200
here, there, and everywhere. He was sure that 
it had come from somewhere on the ground,  

806
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:01,600
so he peered behind bushes and peeped behind 
logs and stones, and then just as he had about  

807
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:07,200
given up hope of finding where it came from, he 
went around a little turn in the old cow-path,  

808
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:14,880
and there right in front of him was little Mr. 
Gartersnake, and what do you think he was doing?  

809
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:21,920
Well, I don't like to tell you, but 
he was trying to swallow one of the  

810
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,440
children of Stickytoes the Tree Toad. Of 
course Farmer Brown's Boy didn't let him.  

811
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,440
He made little Mr. Gartersnake set 
Master Stickytoes free and held Mr.

812
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,000
Gartersnake until Master 
Stickytoes was safely out of reach.

813
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,960
CHAPTER XIX

814
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,320
BUSTER BEAR HAS A FINE TIME

815
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:51,920
Buster Bear was having the finest time he 
had had since he came down from the Great  

816
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,200
Woods to live in the Green Forest. To be 
sure, he wasn't in the Green Forest now,  

817
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:02,960
but he wasn't far from it. He was in the 
Old Pasture, one edge of which touches  

818
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:08,320
one edge of the Green Forest. And where 
do you think he was, in the Old Pasture?  

819
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:14,080
Why, right in the middle of the biggest patch 
of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen in  

820
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:20,640
all his life! Now if there is any one thing that 
Buster Bear had rather have above another, it is  

821
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:27,760
all the berries he can eat, unless it be honey. 
Nothing can quite equal honey in Buster's mind.  

822
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:34,560
But next to honey give him berries. He isn't 
particular what kind of berries. Raspberries,  

823
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,040
blackberries, or blueberries, either 
kind, will make him perfectly happy.

824
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:49,920
"Um-m-m, my, my, but these are good!" he mumbled 
in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice, as he sat on his  

825
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:56,800
haunches stripping off the berries greedily. His 
little eyes twinkled with enjoyment, and he didn't  

826
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,720
mind at all if now and then he got leaves, and 
some green berries in his mouth with the big ripe  

827
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:09,600
berries. He didn't try to get them out. Oh, my, 
no! He just chomped them all up together and  

828
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:16,400
patted his stomach from sheer delight. Now Buster 
had reached the Old Pasture just as jolly, round,  

829
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,920
red Mr. Sun had crept out of bed, and he had 
fully made up his mind that he would be back  

830
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:29,120
in the Green Forest before Mr. Sun had climbed 
very far up in the blue, blue sky. You see,  

831
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:36,560
big as he is and strong as he is, Buster Bear 
is very shy and bashful, and he has no desire to  

832
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:43,840
meet Farmer Brown, or Farmer Brown's boy, or any 
other of those two-legged creatures called men.  

833
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,760
It seems funny but he actually is afraid 
of them. And he had a feeling that he was  

834
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:55,520
a great deal more likely to meet one of them in 
the Old Pasture than deep in the Green Forest.

835
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,520
So when he started to look for berries, he made 
up his mind that he would eat what he could in  

836
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:07,360
a great hurry and get back to the Green Forest 
before Farmer Brown's boy was more than out of  

837
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:14,320
bed. But when he found those berries he was so 
hungry that he forgot his fears and everything  

838
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:22,000
else. They tasted so good that he just had to 
eat and eat and eat. Now you know that Buster is  

839
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:30,240
a very big fellow, and it takes a lot to fill him 
up. He kept eating and eating and eating, and the

840
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:36,880
more he ate the more he wanted. You know 
how it is. So he wandered from one patch  

841
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:43,200
of berries to another in the Old Pasture, 
and never once thought of the time. Somehow,  

842
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,920
time is the hardest thing in the world to 
remember, when you are having a good time.

843
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:56,720
Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed higher and 
higher in the blue, blue sky. He looked down on  

844
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:04,080
all the Great World and saw all that was going on. 
He saw Buster Bear in the Old Pasture, and smiled  

845
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:10,960
as he saw what a perfectly glorious time Buster 
was having. And he saw something else in the Old  

846
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:18,720
Pasture that made his smile still broader. He saw 
Farmer Brown's boy filling a great tin pail with  

847
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:25,040
blueberries, and he knew that Farmer Brown's boy 
didn't know that Buster Bear was anywhere about,  

848
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:32,800
and he knew that Buster Bear didn't know that 
Farmer Brown's boy was anywhere about, and somehow  

849
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,240
he felt very sure that he would see something 
funny happen if they should chance to meet.

850
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:43,040
"Um-m-m, um-m-m,"  

851
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:48,240
mumbled Buster Bear with his mouth full, as 
he moved along to another patch of berries.  

852
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,840
And then he gave a little 
gasp of surprise and delight.  

853
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:59,920
Right in front of him was a shiny thing just full 
of the finest, biggest, bluest berries! There were  

854
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:08,400
no leaves or green ones there. Buster blinked his 
greedy little eyes rapidly and looked again. No,  

855
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,880
he wasn't dreaming. They were real berries, 
and all he had got to do was to help himself.  

856
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:20,640
Buster looked sharply at the shiny thing that 
held the berries. It seemed perfectly harmless.  

857
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:28,400
He reached out a big paw and pushed it gently. It 
tipped over and spilled out a lot of the berries.  

858
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,800
Yes, it was perfectly harmless. Buster 
gave a little sigh of pure happiness.  

859
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:41,520
He would eat those berries to the last one, 
and then he would go home to the Green Forest.

860
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,000
CHAPTER XX

861
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,200
BUSTER BEAR CARRIES OFF THE PAIL

862
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,560
OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY

863
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:58,400
The question is, did Buster Bear steal 
Farmer Brown's boy's pail? To steal is  

864
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,360
to take something which belongs to some 
one else. There is no doubt that he stole  

865
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,520
the berries that were in the pail when he 
found it, for he deliberately ate them.

866
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:14,080
He knew well enough that some one must have picked 
them—for whoever heard of blueberries growing in  

867
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:22,640
tin pails? So there is no doubt that when Buster 
took them, he stole them. But with the pail it was  

868
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:29,840
different. He took the pail, but he didn't mean to 
take it. In fact, he didn't want that pail at all.

869
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:39,760
You see it was this way: When Buster found that 
big tin pail brimming full of delicious berries  

870
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:46,080
in the shade of that big bush in the Old Pasture, 
he didn't stop to think whether or not he had a  

871
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:52,640
right to them. Buster is so fond of berries that 
from the very second that his greedy little eyes  

872
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:58,560
saw that pailful, he forgot everything but 
the feast that was waiting for him right  

873
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,880
under his very nose. He didn't think anything 
about the right or wrong of helping himself.  

874
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:12,080
There before him were more berries than he had 
ever seen together at one time in all his life,  

875
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:18,000
and all he had to do was to eat and eat 
and eat. And that is just what he did do.  

876
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:25,760
Of course he upset the pail, but he didn't mind a 
little thing like that. When he had gobbled up all  

877
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,960
the berries that rolled out, he thrust his nose 
into the pail to get all that were left in it.  

878
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:38,800
Just then he heard a little noise, as if some 
one were coming. He threw up his head to listen,  

879
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,720
and somehow, he never did know just how,  

880
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,560
the handle of the pail slipped back 
over his ears and caught there.

881
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:56,400
This was bad enough, but to make matters worse, 
just at that very minute he heard a shrill,  

882
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:04,160
angry voice shout, "Hi, there! Get out of there!" 
He didn't need to be told whose voice that was.  

883
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:11,200
It was the voice of Farmer Brown's boy. Right 
then and there Buster Bear nearly had a fit.  

884
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:16,560
There was that awful pail fast over his head 
so that he couldn't see a thing. Of course,  

885
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,840
that meant that he couldn't run away, which was 
the thing of all things he most wanted to do,  

886
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:28,720
for big as he is and strong as he is, Buster is 
very shy and bashful when human beings are around.

887
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,840
He growled and whined and squealed. He 
tried to back out of the pail and couldn't.  

888
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:41,520
He tried to shake it off and couldn't. 
He tried to pull it off, but somehow

889
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:48,880
he couldn't get hold of it. Then there was another 
yell. If Buster hadn't been so frightened himself,  

890
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:55,440
he might have recognized that second yell as 
one of fright, for that is what it was. You see  

891
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,720
Farmer Brown's boy had just discovered Buster 
Bear. When he had yelled the first time,  

892
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,600
he had supposed that it was one of the young 
cattle who live in the Old Pasture all summer,  

893
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:12,800
but when he saw Buster, he was just as badly 
frightened as Buster himself. In fact, he was  

894
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:20,560
too surprised and frightened even to run. After 
that second yell he just stood still and stared.

895
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,760
Buster clawed at that awful thing on 
his head more frantically than ever.

896
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,120
Suddenly it slipped off, so that he could see.  

897
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:36,520
He gave one frightened look at Farmer 
Brown's boy, and then with a mighty "Woof!"  

898
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,920
he started for the Green Forest as fast as his 
legs could take him, and this was very fast  

899
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:50,000
indeed, let me tell you. He didn't stop to pick 
out a path, but just crashed through the bushes  

900
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:56,400
as if they were nothing at all, just nothing 
at all. But the funniest thing of all is this—

901
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:03,760
he took that pail with him! Yes, Sir, Buster 
Bear ran away with the big tin pail of Farmer  

902
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,520
Brown's boy! You see when it slipped off his 
head, the handle was still around his neck,  

903
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:16,320
and there he was running away with a pail 
hanging from his neck! He didn't want it.  

904
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:23,040
He would have given anything to get rid of it. But 
he took it because he couldn't help it. And that  

905
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:30,880
brings us back to the question, did Buster steal 
Farmer Brown's boy's pail? What do you think?

906
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,600
CHAPTER XXI

907
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,000
SAMMY JAY MAKES THINGS WORSE

908
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:48,880
FOR BUSTER BEAR

909
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:57,280
"Thief, thief, thief! Thief, thief, thief!" 
Sammy Jay was screaming at the top of his lungs,  

910
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,120
as he followed Buster Bear across the 
Old Pasture towards the Green Forest.  

911
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,640
Never had he screamed so loud, and 
never had his voice sounded so excited.  

912
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,640
The little people of the Green Forest, the 
Green Meadows, and the Smiling Pool are so  

913
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:19,760
used to hearing Sammy cry thief that usually they 
think very little about it. But every blessed one  

914
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:25,520
who heard Sammy this morning stopped whatever 
he was doing and pricked up his ears to listen.

915
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:32,800
Sammy's cousin, Blacky the Crow, just happened 
to be flying along the edge of the Old Pasture,  

916
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:39,040
and the minute he heard Sammy's voice, he turned 
and flew over to see what it was all about. Just  

917
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:44,000
as soon as he caught sight of Buster Bear running 
for the Green Forest as hard as ever he could,  

918
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,640
he understood what had excited Sammy so. He was so 
surprised that he almost forgot to keep his wings  

919
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:58,000
moving. Buster Bear had what looked to Blacky 
very much like a tin pail hanging from his neck!  

920
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,800
No wonder Sammy was excited. Blacky beat 
his wings fiercely and started after Sammy.

921
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:11,440
And so they reached the edge of the Green Forest, 
Buster Bear running as hard as ever he could,  

922
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:17,920
Sammy Jay flying just behind him and screaming, 
"Thief, thief, thief!" at the top of his lungs,  

923
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:27,200
and behind him Blacky the Crow, trying to catch up 
and yelling as loud as he could, "Caw, caw, caw!  

924
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,240
Come on, everybody! Come on! Come on!"

925
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:38,560
Poor Buster! It was bad enough to be frightened 
almost to death as he had been up in the Old  

926
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,520
Pasture when the pail had caught over his head 
just as Farmer Brown's boy had yelled at him.  

927
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:49,440
Then to have the handle of the pail slip 
down around his neck so that he couldn't  

928
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:55,360
get rid of the pail but had to take it with 
him as he ran, was making a bad matter worse.  

929
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,800
Now to have all his neighbors of the Green 
Forest see him in such a fix and make fun of him,  

930
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:10,560
was more than he could stand. He felt 
humiliated. That is just another way of saying  

931
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,320
shamed. Yes, Sir, Buster felt that he 
was shamed in the eyes of his neighbors,  

932
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:22,160
and he wanted nothing so much as to get away 
by himself, where no one could see him, and try

933
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:27,760
to get rid of that dreadful pail. But Buster 
is so big that it is not easy for him to  

934
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:34,080
find a hiding place. So, when he reached the 
Green Forest, he kept right on to the deepest,  

935
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:40,320
darkest, most lonesome part and crept under 
the thickest hemlock-tree he could find.

936
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:48,240
But it was of no use. The sharp eyes of Sammy 
Jay and Blacky the Crow saw him. They actually  

937
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:54,480
flew into the very tree under which he was 
hiding, and how they did scream! Pretty soon  

938
01:31:54,480 --> 01:32:01,200
Ol' Mistah Buzzard came dropping down out of the 
blue, blue sky and took a seat on a convenient  

939
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:07,520
dead tree, where he could see all that went on. 
Ol' Mistah Buzzard began to grin as soon as he  

940
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:15,120
saw that tin pail on Buster's neck. Then came 
others,—Redtail the Hawk, Scrapper the Kingbird,  

941
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:22,080
Redwing the Blackbird, Drummer the Woodpecker, 
Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the Chickadee, Jenny  

942
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:28,640
Wren, Redeye the Vireo, and ever so many more. 
They came from the Old Orchard, the Green Meadows,  

943
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:34,800
and even down by the Smiling Pool, for the voices 
of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow carried far,  

944
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:40,800
and at the sound of them everybody hurried 
over, sure that something exciting was going on.

945
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:48,720
Presently Buster heard light footsteps, and 
peeping out, he saw Billy Mink and Peter Rabbit  

946
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:55,600
and Jumper the Hare and Prickly Porky 
and Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk. Even timid  

947
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:00,560
little Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was where he 
could peer out and see without being seen.  

948
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:06,000
Of course, Chatterer the Red Squirrel and 
Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were there.  

949
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:11,280
There they all sat in a great circle 
around him, each where he felt safe,  

950
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:18,000
but where he could see, and every one of 
them laughing and making fun of Buster.

951
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:25,360
"Thief, thief, thief!" screamed Sammy 
until his throat was sore. The worst of it  

952
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:31,920
was Buster knew that everybody knew that it 
was true. That awful pail was proof of it.

953
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:39,360
"I wish I never had thought of 
berries," growled Buster to himself.

954
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,160
CHAPTER XXII

955
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,760
BUSTER BEAR HAS A FIT OF TEMPER

956
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,880
A temper is a bad, bad thing

957
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,720
When once it gets away.

958
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,480
There's nothing quite at all like it

959
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,240
To spoil a pleasant day.

960
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:03,920
Buster Bear was in a terrible temper. Yes, 
Sir, Buster Bear was having the worst fit of  

961
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:09,040
temper ever seen in the Green Forest. And 
the worst part of it all was that all his  

962
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:14,560
neighbors of the Green Forest and a whole lot 
from the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool  

963
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:20,640
were also there to see it. It is bad enough 
to give way to temper when you are all alone,  

964
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:25,600
and there is no one to watch you, but 
when you let temper get the best of you  

965
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,560
right where others see you, oh, dear, 
dear, it certainly is a sorry sight.

966
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:37,280
Now ordinarily Buster is one of the most 
good-natured persons in the world. It takes a  

967
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:43,520
great deal to rouse his temper. He isn't one tenth 
so quick tempered as Chatterer the Red Squirrel,  

968
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:51,120
or Sammy Jay, or Reddy Fox. But when his temper 
is aroused and gets away from him, then watch  

969
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:57,200
out! It seemed to Buster that he had had all 
that he could stand that day and a little more.  

970
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,120
First had come the fright back there in the 
Old Pasture. Then the pail had slipped down  

971
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:08,560
behind his ears and held fast, so he had run 
all the way to the Green Forest with it hanging  

972
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:15,120
about his neck. This was bad enough, for he 
knew just how funny he must look, and besides,  

973
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:22,640
it was very uncomfortable. But to have Sammy Jay 
call everybody within hearing to come and see him  

974
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:28,960
was more than he could stand. It seemed to Buster 
as if everybody who lives in the Green Forest,  

975
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:35,760
on the Green Meadows, or around the Smiling Brook, 
was sitting around his hiding place, laughing  

976
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:41,840
and making fun of him. It was more than 
any self-respecting Bear could stand.

977
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:47,120
With a roar of anger Buster Bear 
charged out of his hiding place.  

978
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:53,120
He rushed this way and that way! He roared with 
all his might! He was very terrible to see.

979
01:35:54,160 --> 01:36:01,680
Those who could fly, flew. Those who could climb, 
climbed. And those who were swift of foot, ran.  

980
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,320
A few who could neither fly nor climb nor 
run fast, hid and lay shaking and trembling  

981
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:13,520
for fear that Buster would find them. In 
less time than it takes to tell about it,  

982
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,440
Buster was alone. At least, 
he couldn't see any one.

983
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,120
Illus Those who could fly, flew. 
Those who could climb, climbed.

984
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:25,360
Then he vented his temper on the tin pail. He 
cuffed at it and pulled at it, all the time  

985
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:30,240
growling angrily. He lay down and 
clawed at it with his hind feet.  

986
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:36,960
At last the handle broke, and 
he was free! He shook himself.  

987
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:44,640
Then he jumped on the helpless pail. With a blow 
of a big paw he sent it clattering against a tree.  

988
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:52,000
He tried to bite it. Then he once more 
fell to knocking it this way and that way,  

989
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,200
until it was pounded flat, and no one would 
ever have guessed that it had once been a pail.

990
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:05,840
Then, and not till then, did Buster 
recover his usual good nature.  

991
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:15,120
Little by little, as he thought it all over, a 
look of shame crept into his face. "I—I guess  

992
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:22,320
it wasn't the fault of that thing. I ought to 
have known enough to keep my head out of it,"

993
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,360
he said slowly and thoughtfully.

994
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,720
"You got no more than you deserve for 
stealing Farmer Brown's boy's berries,"

995
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,680
said Sammy Jay, who had come back and 
was looking on from the top of a tree.

996
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,800
"You ought to know by this time 
that no good comes of stealing."

997
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,160
Buster Bear looked up and grinned, 
and there was a twinkle in his eyes.  

998
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:54,400
"You ought to know, Sammy Jay," said 
he. "I hope you'll always remember it."

999
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,920
"Thief, thief, thief!" 
screamed Sammy, and flew away.

1000
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,720
CHAPTER XXIII

1001
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,800
FARMER BROWN'S BOY LUNCHES ON

1002
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,280
BERRIES

1003
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,480
When things go wrong in spite of you

1004
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,800
To smile's the best thing you can do—

1005
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,640
To smile and say, "I'm mighty glad

1006
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,600
They are no worse; they're not so bad!"

1007
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,960
That is what Farmer Brown's boy 
said when he found that Buster Bear  

1008
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:33,600
had stolen the berries he had worked so hard to 
pick and then had run off with the pail. You see,  

1009
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:39,920
Farmer Brown's boy is learning to be something of 
a philosopher, one of those people who accept bad  

1010
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:45,840
things cheerfully and right away see how they 
are better than they might have been. When he  

1011
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,040
had first heard some one in the bushes where he 
had hidden his pail of berries, he had been very  

1012
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:55,920
sure that it was one of the cows or young cattle 
who live in the Old Pasture during the summer.

1013
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,840
He had been afraid that they might stupidly 
kick over the pail and spill the berries,  

1014
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,720
and he had hurried to drive whoever it was away.  

1015
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:10,000
It hadn't entered his head that it could 
be anybody who would eat those berries.

1016
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,880
When he had yelled and Buster Bear had suddenly 
appeared, struggling to get off the pail which  

1017
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:20,160
had caught over his head, Farmer Brown's 
boy had been too frightened to even move.  

1018
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:26,240
Then he had seen Buster tear away through 
the brush even more frightened than he was,  

1019
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:29,280
and right away his courage had begun to come back.

1020
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,880
"If he is so afraid of me, I 
guess I needn't be afraid of him,"  

1021
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:41,520
said he. "I've lost my berries, but it is 
worth it to find out that he is afraid of me.  

1022
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:48,240
There are plenty more on the bushes, and all I've 
got to do is to pick them. It might be worse."

1023
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,400
He walked over to the place where the pail 
had been, and then he remembered that when  

1024
01:39:54,400 --> 01:40:00,160
Buster ran away he had carried the pail with 
him, hanging about his neck. He whistled.  

1025
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:06,960
It was a comical little whistle of chagrin as 
he realized that he had nothing in which to put  

1026
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:14,240
more berries, even if he picked them. "It's worse 
than I thought," cried he. "That bear has cheated  

1027
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:21,360
me out of that berry pie my mother promised me." 
Then he began to laugh, as he thought of how funny

1028
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:27,360
Buster Bear had looked with the pail about his 
neck, and then because, you know he is learning  

1029
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:34,960
to be a philosopher, he once more repeated, "It 
might have been worse. Yes, indeed, it might have  

1030
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:42,000
been worse. That bear might have tried to eat me 
instead of the berries. I guess I'll go eat that  

1031
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:50,080
lunch I left back by the spring, and then I'll 
go home. I can pick berries some other day."

1032
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:55,760
Chuckling happily over Buster Bear's great fright, 
Farmer Brown's boy tramped back to the spring  

1033
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:01,520
where he had left two thick sandwiches on a flat 
stone when he started to save his pail of berries.  

1034
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,880
"My, but those sandwiches will taste good,"

1035
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,640
thought he. "I'm glad they are big and 
thick. I never was hungrier in my life.

1036
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:19,040
Hello!" This he exclaimed right out loud, 
for he had just come in sight of the flat  

1037
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,680
stone where the sandwiches should 
have been, and they were not there.  

1038
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,360
No, Sir, there wasn't so much as a crumb 
left of those two thick sandwiches.  

1039
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:38,160
You see, Old Man Coyote had found them and 
gobbled them up while Farmer Brown's boy was away.

1040
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:45,360
But Farmer Brown's boy didn't know anything about 
Old Man Coyote. He rubbed his eyes and stared  

1041
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:50,240
everywhere, even up in the trees, as if he thought 
those sandwiches might be hanging up there.  

1042
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:56,320
They had disappeared as completely as if 
they never had been, and Old Man Coyote had  

1043
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:04,320
taken care to leave no trace of his visit. Farmer 
Brown's boy gaped foolishly this way and that way.  

1044
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:11,440
Then, instead of growing angry, a slow 
smile stole over his freckled face.  

1045
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:19,760
"I guess some one else was hungry too," he 
muttered. "Wonder who it was? Guess this  

1046
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:25,120
Old Pasture is no place for me to-day. I'll 
fill up on berries and then I'll go home."

1047
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:32,320
So Farmer Brown's boy made his lunch on 
blueberries and then rather sheepishly he  

1048
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:37,040
started for home to tell of all the strange 
things that had happened to him in the Old  

1049
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:44,480
Pasture. Two or three times, as he trudged along, 
he stopped to scratch his head thoughtfully. "I  

1050
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:52,240
guess," said he at last, "that I'm not so smart as 
I thought I was, and I've got a lot to learn yet."

1051
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,680
This is the end of the adventures 
of Buster Bear in this book  

1052
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:05,280
because—guess why. Because Old Mr. Toad insists 
that I must write a book about his adventures,  

1053
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:11,280
and Old Mr. Toad is such a good friend 
of all of us that I am going to do it.

1054
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,930
- THE END -
