00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,340
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,880
On board the Parvina

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,920
Leaning on the rail at the stern of the cruise
ship Parvina, sipping his champagne, Eddie

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,580
Munro looked out across the water and into
the darkness. There was a warm, gentle breeze,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,660
and the sea was calm except for the dizzy
trail of water churned up by the ship's angry

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,580
propellers. It was a beautiful evening and
there was no one else on deck. Eddie liked

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,190
it that way.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,250
He looked down at his watch, which showed
10.31 p.m., and the ship was already half

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,699
a mile from the harbour. He was amazed that
such a huge cruise ship could move so fast

10
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:48,540
- he was amazed it stayed afloat at all! He
watched St Thomas island getting further and

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,840
further away. He stared at the silhouette
of the island, at its faint black shapes of

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,480
hills rising up into the night sky. Eddie
smiled to himself as he noticed he could no

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,600
longer see where the lights ended and the
stars began.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,679
He finished his champagne and, for good luck,
threw the glass far out into the sea. He never

15
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:17,170
heard it drop. He couldn't see much at all
in the warm Caribbean darkness, but he noticed

16
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:25,329
for the first time how high up he was. The
sea was a long, long way down, he thought.

17
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:30,590
At this point his wife, Lynn, came out looking
for him, wearing her long black evening dress

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,810
and the silk purple scarf she had bought on
the excursion earlier in the day. Her hair

19
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,280
was dark and short with plum-coloured highlights.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,840
He turned to put his arm around her as she
joined him. He noticed her perfume, a powerful

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,929
and luxurious scent.

22
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:55,640
"Hello," he said, turning round. "You smell
nice. And you look lovely. Are you married?"

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,309
"Yes, thank you. To a very wealthy man, so
you have no chance," she said, smiling.

24
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:05,189
"Ah. But so am I."

25
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,209
"Ah, so you're married to a wealthy man, are
you?"

26
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,510
"I mean I'm wealthy. Very rich, in fact."

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,290
"Well aren't you the lucky one," Lynn said.

28
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,989
"Yes, so if you're lucky, I might buy you
dinner," said Eddie, turning back to look

29
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,870
out to sea once more.

30
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,409
"Well, lucky me. How can I refuse such charm?"
She looked at him and took hold of his hand.

31
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,709
She smiled and stared out into the night,
too, to the island which was now even further

32
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:38,799
away.

33
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:44,299
"I thought I'd find you out here," she said.
"How many glasses have you thrown into the

34
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,340
sea this evening?"

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,569
"Only two," he said.

36
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,569
"Eddie!"

37
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,819
"It's good luck."

38
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:54,400
"No, it isn't. Not if you're a fish and you
get hit by a glass."

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,629
"The fish might like it. It's probably quite
boring being a fish. The sudden arrival of

40
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,349
a champagne glass might brighten up your life."

41
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,969
"Or end it," she said.

42
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:08,269
"It's fun," said Eddie. "You should try it."

43
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,650
"I think I've had enough champagne," his wife
said.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,430
"I love the way the glass disappears the minute
it leaves my hand, and the sea eats it up.

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,680
You can't see it falling and you can't hear
it hit the water. But you know it's landed,

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,700
dived in and sunk to the bottom. Imagine - a
tiny glass holding a giant ocean."

47
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:36,319
"You think too much," she said, moving away
and pulling him with her. "Why don't you come

48
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,950
back inside? They're serving coffee and I
think there's going to be some jazz."

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,420
"All right," he said. "Just a few more minutes."

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,150
"We have two more weeks on this cruise, Eddie.
You have plenty of time to take it all in."

51
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,139
"It's incredible, though, isn't it? So beautiful.
It's perfect."

52
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:01,430
Lynn laughed. "It's completely black. I can't
see anything in the dark."

53
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,200
"I know. But it's all out there. The blue
sea, the white sand, the palm trees, the boats..."

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,879
"The champagne glasses..."

55
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:16,160
"Very funny," said Eddie. Then he pointed
to the horizon. "Look over there at the dots

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,880
of light. Do you think they're lights on the
island or stars?"

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,310
Lynn looked hard into the night and gave it
some thought. "Erm... lights."

58
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,449
"But you're not sure."

59
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,199
"I am sure. I'm always sure."

60
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,430
"Hmm," he said. "How is that?"

61
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,009
"Because I'm always right," she said, smiling.

62
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,250
"Oh really?"

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,820
"Of course. I was right about setting up your
own business, wasn't I?"

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
"Yes."

65
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,650
"And I was right about selling the business
off this year for twenty million - only sixteen

66
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,810
years after starting."

67
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,819
"Possibly," he teased. He wouldn't give in
so easily.

68
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:06,620
"And I was right to let you take me on this
cruise to relax and celebrate in style."

69
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,110
"Oh, I see. How generous."

70
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,830
"Just think. You don't have to work ever again.
You're a millionaire, Mr Edward Munro. How

71
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,740
does that sound?"

72
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,639
"Lucky me," he said proudly.

73
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:28,400
"Yes, lucky you. Lucky us. Now come inside
before we lose all our money paying for missing

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,620
champagne glasses."

75
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,479
Back inside, the dining room was full of people.
It was hot, but the lighting made it welcoming

76
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,270
and comfortable. In the time Eddie had been
outside, a space had been cleared for dancing

77
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,060
and a few couples were already on their feet.
In the corner, four musicians, three men and

78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,930
one woman, were playing a song Eddie knew
well, but he couldn't recall its name. The

79
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,599
singer was wearing a navy blue cocktail dress,
and the men were wearing tuxedos, black ties

80
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,050
and formal dinner suits.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,720
Eddie noticed how young the woman looked.
Too young to have known the tune when it first

82
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,960
appeared, Eddie thought, but her voice was
strong and clear. And she seemed to believe

83
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,080
in the words, at least. How old was she? Twenty-five?
Twenty-six? Imagine singing on a cruise ship

84
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,479
in your twenties! What a life! The fun, the
parties, the people. The places to go and

85
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,630
things to see - before your life had even
started.

86
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:39,409
It seems so easy now, Eddie thought. His twenties
had been very different. And his thirties.

87
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:45,160
Eddie tried not to think about his own past.
Now was all that mattered. The past was the

88
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,949
past. 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,'
Clive, his business partner, always said.

89
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,750
'No such thing as luck,' he once said, 'it's
simply the moment when preparation meets opportunity.'

90
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,389
By now, Eddie was sitting back at his table
and next to his wife. She was watching the

91
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,759
band and tapping the table. She smiled at
the other passengers opposite her, who smiled

92
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,599
back, relaxed and enjoying the moment. Eddie
looked at his watch. It was almost 11 p.m.,

93
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,280
but he wasn't tired. Quite the opposite. He
felt relaxed and energized. He'd always been

94
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,060
an evening person, never a morning person.

95
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,689
He looked around at the giant lounge with
its circular tables and well-dressed diners,

96
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:34,970
and the perfect white tablecloths. The waiters
and waitresses in their smart uniforms moved

97
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,030
smoothly in and out of the room, and Eddie's
eyes followed them as they carried plates

98
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,930
and coffee and cakes and trays around the
tables, along the aisles and past the bar.

99
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,570
Eddie watched the barman throwing ice cubes
and cocktail shakers in the air and juggling

100
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:58,479
them as he made the drinks in acrobatic style.
He was confident and polished, and also young.

101
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,120
Possibly the same age as the singer. Why was
everyone so young these days? Where were all

102
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,570
the cruise ship jobs when Eddie was trying
to get started in life? Why hadn't he thought

103
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,270
of working on a ship in the Caribbean?

104
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,110
He found himself staring at the bar in the
distance. He was no longer thinking of anything

105
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,889
in particular. He was simply listening to
the sounds of jazz and the noise of a few

106
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,409
hundred people talking and laughing.

107
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,930
And that was when he saw him.

108
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,011
That was the moment when he saw Dominic for
the first time in many, many years. The man

109
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:43,080
was sitting at the bar, leaning forward and
smoking a large cigar. He was older now, clearly,

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,970
and his hair was very grey, but Eddie had
no doubt that it was him. He couldn't believe

111
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,920
that awful man was here on the ship.

112
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,190
And then everything was different.

113
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,600
Nothing was the same. All was spoiled.

114
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,510
Just like before.

115
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,960
CHAPTER TWO
Argument with Dominic

116
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:12,070
"You know your problem, Eddie?" said Dominic
Stephens in his office. "You're too hands-on."

117
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,970
He leaned back in his large, leather chair
behind his glass desk. He seldom made eye

118
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,530
contact. His shoulders looked tense and his
neck was hidden.

119
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,290
"I don't understand," said Eddie. "How can
that be a problem? The team really appreciates

120
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,120
my style and the customers love it. It's what
I do best. It's why I was brought here in

121
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,440
the first place."

122
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,790
"Oh, really?" said Dominic, clearly unimpressed.

123
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,210
"I know for a fact that Ann and Gary didn't
want an executive to run things. They wanted

124
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:49,200
someone with practical experience, and drive
- and lots of it. They said dull and uninspiring

125
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,401
executives and managers have come and gone
and there's been no direction, no feeling

126
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,940
for the business. No passion."

127
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,690
"And you have passion?" said Dominic.

128
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,350
"Yes. Do you?"

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,190
"This isn't about me, Eddie. It's about you,
and it takes more than passion to do this

130
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,420
job. You need to be a leader."

131
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,920
"I am a leader," replied Eddie. "I've done
it for years. My track record speaks for itself."

132
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
"Well, you can't do it all by yourself."

133
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,460
"I'm not trying to do it all by myself, Dominic.
I'm building a team. I'm training new people.

134
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,730
Resources are limited. It takes time."

135
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,380
"We don't have time, Eddie."

136
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,970
What did Dominic Stephens know about passion
or time? wondered Eddie. The only passion

137
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,700
he seemed to have was being in charge. And
golf. He seemed to have a lot of time for

138
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,910
that. He even kept his clubs in the corner
of his office. And today was Thursday. On

139
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,770
Thursdays he always left early to play golf
and he didn't even try to hide it.

140
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:02,580
Eddie was so angry his mouth was dry. "I don't
know why you have a problem with me, Dominic.

141
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,410
There's nothing wrong with my performance.
Quite the opposite in fact."

142
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,150
"Oh, really?"

143
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,950
"Yes. When I joined Fenton's, they were only
producing software for small businesses in

144
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,570
the UK. They had some accounting packages
and sales and marketing databases, but not

145
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,510
much else. I was brought in to expand the
business and build exports, and that is exactly

146
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:30,360
what I have done. I brought in some very talented
people to develop our products, and we now

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,950
offer some unique and very powerful programs
used by the biggest and best companies globally.

148
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:42,660
When I proposed and won the Moscow account,
you said it couldn't be done, and now we supply

149
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,380
the entire Russian region."

150
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:53,070
"Erm, excuse me, Mr Passion. I won the Moscow
contract for you," said Dominic, pointing

151
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,580
firmly at his own chest.

152
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:02,260
Eddie could not believe his ears. This was
so unfair. Rage filled his whole mind and

153
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,900
body. "You did not win that contract. You
knew some of the people in the Russian state

154
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,950
department there, that's all. I spent most
of last year - and the year before - going

155
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:18,410
to Russia and working long, long hours to
build a business plan that would work. Don't

156
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,200
take the credit away from me, Dominic. Without
me, this company could never have won such

157
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,140
a high-profile project."

158
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,960
"Well, I still haven't seen the final numbers,
and I still haven't seen the new business

159
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,510
plan," Dominic said, throwing his arms around.

160
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,820
"Yes, you have. I've kept you informed the
whole time with numerous emails."

161
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:46,240
"Oh, emails, emails! I don't have time for
emails. I get about three hundred a day. How

162
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,840
on earth can I keep up with all that?"

163
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,110
Well, it would help if you didn't play so
much golf, Eddie wanted to say. It would help

164
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,610
if you let me do my job and didn't interfere.
It would help if you weren't so aggressive.

165
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:06,290
Instead, he tried to remain diplomatic and
said, "Well, if you don't read my emails,

166
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,620
how can we communicate?"

167
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,690
"Simple. Pick up the phone."

168
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,260
He made it sound so easy. This was ridiculous.
"I do call you, Dominic. You're never there.

169
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,220
I leave messages but you don't call back.
When we do get time to meet, I don't think

170
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
you're really listening."

171
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:31,701
"I'm always listening to you, Eddie," said
Dominic in a weary voice. "Because you talk

172
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:37,680
so much, that's all you ever do. Talk, talk,
talk."

173
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,370
"You're making personal comments, and that
is not professional. I talk because I'm passionate.

174
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,830
And I deliver. If I say I'll do something,
I do it, and within budget, and you know it."

175
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:55,200
"You were not on budget. Last year you went
over budget by 25,000 pounds"

176
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,990
Not this again. Eddie was so tired of the
same story. "I can account for every penny

177
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:07,980
my department spent. No one seems to know
what happened to that 25,000 pounds."

178
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,750
Dominic looked at him accusingly.

179
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,320
"Don't look at me like that," said Eddie.

180
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,160
"Like what?"

181
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,650
"Look, the way I see it..." Eddie began, but
again he was cut off in mid-sentence. Dominic

182
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,410
always interrupted everyone. He was like a
spoilt child.

183
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,080
And so the situation was impossible. Eddie
simply wanted to leave. He could no longer

184
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,930
focus. He could never win.

185
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,500
Eddie came out of the office. His whole body
was trembling, and he tried very hard not

186
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,560
to slam the door, scream or break something.
He realized he was too angry and too upset

187
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,530
to go back to the team or finish his work.
He decided to slip out of the office for ten

188
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:59,620
minutes, just to calm down. He would have
a coffee. Or call Lynn. Come on, Ed, he told

189
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,940
himself. Get things in perspective. It's only
a job.

190
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,700
He was almost at reception and the main door,
when Clive passed him on the way to the photocopier.

191
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,200
"Ed, what's wrong?" he asked, stopping in
the corridor.

192
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,560
Eddie couldn't speak. He was afraid to say
anything, as he didn't know what might come

193
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,950
out. His face was red and tears were stinging
his eyes. He looked down, ignored Clive and

194
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,990
walked out of the door into the street and
towards the local cafe.

195
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,440
CHAPTER THREE
Someone from the past

196
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:42,490
"You all right, Eddie?" asked Lynn, who had
noticed Eddie staring at the bar. Eddie took

197
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,500
a moment and then said, "Yes, fine. Why?"
But he was still lost in thought. He wasn't

198
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,580
sure if the ship was moving or if he was dizzy.

199
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,130
"You look so serious. Come on, let's dance."

200
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,950
He was still staring at the bar. The man was
still there. It was Dominic. Sitting at the

201
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:10,061
bar barely fifty meters away, drinking and
smoking. As simple as that. Was the world

202
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:16,190
so small? thought Eddie. Couldn't it be a
bit bigger? Why here? Why now? After all this

203
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:22,090
time. Why on this ship? A familiar sickness
in his stomach returned.

204
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,840
"Well, don't get too excited, will you?" Eddie
heard his wife say.

205
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,310
"Sorry?" he said, turning his attention to
Lynn.

206
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,740
"A dance! Can we dance?" Lynn said impatiently.

207
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,350
"Yes, sure. Sorry."

208
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,110
They both got up and walked to the dance floor.
They held each other and danced slowly for

209
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,070
the final verse of yet another song whose
name Eddie couldn't remember.

210
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,310
Turning in the dance, Eddie was pleased that
Lynn was there with him as he tried to take

211
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,100
in the fact that he was now staring at the
distant shape of Dominic Stephens, on the

212
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,950
far side of the ship's dining room. The man,
Eddie saw, now turned to watch the dining

213
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:10,740
room and the dancing. He was hidden in a fog
of his own cigar smoke. How Eddie had hated

214
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,079
him. And how, after all this time, he still
hated him.

215
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,339
The memories.

216
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,470
The anger.

217
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,530
The pain.

218
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:27,120
"Are you sure you're feeling all right, Eddie?"
asked Lynn when they got back to their cabin.

219
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,730
Eddie was sitting on the bed staring into
space.

220
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,700
"Yes. Just tired. I think I'm still jet-lagged,
and I'm tired after walking on the island

221
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
today."

222
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,210
"You sure?"

223
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,210
"Yes."

224
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,460
"That trip on the glass-bottomed submarine
was amazing, wasn't it?"

225
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,269
"Yeah," said Eddie. But he still couldn't
think straight. His mind was filling up more

226
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:54,250
and more with the terrible realization that
Dominic was on the ship.

227
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,159
Lynn knew him too well. "Eddie," she said,
sitting down beside him, taking his hand and

228
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,120
looking at him. She stroked the back of his
head. "What's wrong?"

229
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,169
Eddie had decided to accept that the trip
was now spoiled. Did he need to spoil it for

230
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:16,850
his wife? She didn't have to know. They would
have their luxury cruise and go home to a

231
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:23,160
new life. The ship was big enough. Dominic
and Eddie both looked older and Dominic probably

232
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,009
wouldn't even remember him, so why worry about
it?

233
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:31,309
But all the old feelings were there again,
and Eddie could sense his energy slipping

234
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:37,490
away just thinking about it. It showed on
his face and Lynn could see it. Eddie could

235
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,429
never hide much from his wife, and before
he knew it he found himself weakening.

236
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:51,200
"It's Dominic. He's on the ship." It sounded
so strange to Eddie to even say those words.

237
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,899
There was a pause.

238
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,370
Lynn looked more closely at her husband.

239
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,840
"What?" said Lynn quietly. "Dominic Stephens?
You're kidding."

240
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,600
"I'm not kidding, Lynn. I wish I was," said
Eddie.

241
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,830
"I haven't heard that name in a long time."

242
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,110
"Well, he's here."

243
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,460
"How do you know he's here?"

244
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,110
"I saw him. He was sitting at the bar this
evening when we came in from the deck."

245
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,881
"Eddie, we were sitting on the other side
of the dining room - you could hardly see

246
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,260
anything. How can you be sure it was him?"

247
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:35,750
"Oh, I'm sure, Lynn. No mistake. The same
fat, lazy bloke. But less hair now. And grey.

248
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,440
And fatter."

249
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,700
Lynn was still trying to take it in. "Dominic
Stephens is on this ship?"

250
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,750
"Yes."

251
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,179
She waited a moment. "Oh, Eddie."

252
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,570
They both sat there for a moment. Then Lynn
spoke again. She was already recovering. "Well,

253
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:02,120
look, it's a long time ago, Ed. It doesn't
matter any more. He doesn't matter any more.

254
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,929
He's nothing. You don't have to talk to him."

255
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,000
"I know."

256
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,179
"It's a big ship," Lynn continued. "It's extremely
unlikely you're going meet him..."

257
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,379
"I saw him at the bar!" said Eddie.

258
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:19,399
"... and even if you met him by chance, as
I said, he won't remember you." Then she looked

259
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:24,940
closely at Eddie and asked softly, "You didn't
speak to him, did you?"

260
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,179
"No," replied Eddie. "Of course not."

261
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,149
"And did he see you?"

262
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:36,600
"No." Eddie wasn't sure if Dominic had seen
him or not. Probably not. "Well, that's OK

263
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,840
then," Lynn said, but she knew it was an unhelpful
thing to say.

264
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,149
"It's not OK, Lynn. It's not OK at all. That
man is back."

265
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,649
"He's not back. Try to calm down."

266
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:55,230
"Calm down?!" said Eddie, raising his voice
and standing up. "We lost everything because

267
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,860
of him, Lynn, everything - he cheated and
bullied and took it all away!"

268
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:07,470
"Yes, I know, Ed, but it was sixteen years
ago. We've come a long way since then. You

269
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,330
and Clive have each just put ten million quid
in the bank!"

270
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,570
"So what? Dominic got away with it all at
Fenton's!"

271
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,289
"It's all in the past. It doesn't matter anymore."

272
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:24,700
"It does matter. He's still getting away with
it. He still looks very pleased with himself."

273
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,650
"You don't know that. You don't know his life
now. I can't believe we're talking about all

274
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,220
this after so long."

275
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,150
"Because he's here, Lynn. On the ship. On
our cruise!"

276
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:44,899
"Eddie, listen to me. Calm down. He and Neal
gave you a bad time, I know. But you fought

277
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:51,320
back and survived, and you became successful
anyway. Without him. In spite of him and the

278
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,409
things he said and did. You're here with me
now, on holiday, with financial security for

279
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:04,559
the rest of our lives. You did it. You climbed
back out of the hole and it's OK. He can't

280
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,039
hurt you anymore."

281
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,549
"He nearly destroyed us, Lynn."

282
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:12,919
"But he didn't, did he? We didn't let him."

283
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:20,840
Eddie wiped the tears from his eyes. "I can't
believe he's on board! Why? He's still out

284
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,960
there getting in the way. Spoiling everything."

285
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:31,440
"He's not spoiling anything. Only if you let
him. You've come a long way since he pushed

286
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
you out."

287
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,940
"So why do I suddenly feel so angry? I can't
believe it. I think of him and those days

288
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,190
at Fenton's from time to time, sometimes a
lot, and it never upsets me.

289
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,549
"Well, you went through a tough time. It was
very hard. If you really did see him tonight,

290
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:55,269
of course that's going to upset you. It's
not the same as the occasional memory."

291
00:22:55,269 --> 00:23:01,299
"Oh, I saw him all right. He still smokes
those hideous cigars."

292
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:03,950
"OK," said Lynn.

293
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,830
"You went through it too, you know," he reminded
her.

294
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,669
"I know."

295
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:10,789
Another pause.

296
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:20,470
"We lost so much, Lynn: the house, the money.
Us. I was off sick for a year. A year!"

297
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,539
"I know," said Lynn. "There's no getting away
from the damage the man caused. But you have

298
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:32,259
to calm down. Nothing is going to happen.
You don't have to see him again or talk to

299
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:33,259
him."

300
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,830
"Well, what if he takes the same excursion
as us at some point? Or sits at our table

301
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,830
for dinner?"

302
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:46,760
"Eddie, there are almost 2,000 people on board.
It won't happen. We can ignore him. Being

303
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,590
the sort of person Dominic is, he's probably
treated lots of people the way he treated

304
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,990
you, so he won't know who you are or remember
what he did."

305
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,320
"Somehow that makes it worse."

306
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,200
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it.
If we see him again or he even recognizes

307
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,559
you, we'll cross that bridge when we come
to it, all right?"

308
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,139
Eddie was quiet.

309
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:15,919
"All right?" Lynn repeated, holding his face
in her hands.

310
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,630
"OK," said Eddie.

311
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,980
CHAPTER FOUR
After the argument

312
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,889
Eddie sat in a cafe not far from the office,
dipping his teaspoon into a large cappuccino,

313
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:33,720
and tried to think of what he could do about
his job. He could leave, but that would mean

314
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,570
giving in and letting Dominic have exactly
what he wanted. Besides, it would take several

315
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,470
months, possibly a year, to find another good
job, and he would still have to put up with

316
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,970
him in the meantime. He could officially complain
about Dominic's behavior. He had a strong

317
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:56,820
case. But that would only make things worse.
Somehow Dominic had Gary, the CEO, on his

318
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,999
side. And Ann Blake, the Financial Director,
would never support getting rid of Dominic,

319
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,580
since she had hired him in the first place.

320
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,619
"He's unbelievable. He actually said I was
too hands-on," said Eddie, stabbing at his

321
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,350
drink with his spoon.

322
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,640
"Really?" said Clive, who had left the office
and found Eddie sitting in the cafe.

323
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,090
"Yes. He also said I wasn't a leader and that
Moscow was his deal."

324
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:31,110
"You're joking," said Clive. He seemed genuinely
surprised. "That deal was yours. Everyone

325
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,230
knows that."

326
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,670
"Then he said my communication wasn't good
enough."

327
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:43,010
"Eh? He can talk. He's got no people skills
whatsoever. Anyway, he never reads his emails."

328
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:50,950
"I know. I told him that. He says I should
phone him," and Eddie laughed in disgust.

329
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,940
"He's never there!"

330
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:59,070
"Exactly! I said that too. It's pointless,
Clive. He doesn't listen and he interrupts

331
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,869
all the time. He's so smug. He thinks he's
right about everything."

332
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:09,170
"At least you're not alone. Everyone has the
same problem with him."

333
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,510
"Well, what is his problem?"

334
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,590
"It's obvious. He's insecure."

335
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,090
"Well, it's not obvious when you're sitting
in a meeting with him."

336
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,330
"He's a bully in a shirt and tie. All bullies
are insecure. Maybe his dad didn't show him

337
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,119
any love. Maybe his dad's worse!"

338
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,240
Eddie tried to smile as he looked out of the
window, as if the answer were out there somewhere.

339
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,179
Maybe if he were to look long enough, the
answer would come and find him. He doubted

340
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,909
it. He was exhausted.

341
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:47,539
"Clive, how do they get to be in charge, these
people? They're utterly useless. He's useless."

342
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:54,669
"Yes, and he knows it. Deep down. That's why
he picks on people and moves responsibility.

343
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:57,049
No one actually knows what he does."

344
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,570
"Yeah, and by the time they find out they
have to pay him a year's salary, and then

345
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,100
he gets another job."

346
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,919
"That's his skill, though. He talks well to
the top guys. But the real people don't respect

347
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,299
him. I spoke to someone at Gallagher's the
other week, where Dominic worked for about

348
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,529
two years. They said the same thing."

349
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:20,519
"Do you think he has any idea what people
really think and say about him?"

350
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:26,730
"No, I don't think he does. He's so superior
in his own mind he probably thinks we're all

351
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,730
losers."

352
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:34,630
"But he knows I'm good. He knows you're good
too, and that really irritates him, because

353
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,700
we know this job and he doesn't. He just moves
tasks and people around all day and calls

354
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,840
it strategy."

355
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,269
"I know," said Clive.

356
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,480
They both stared out of the window.

357
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:54,539
"Did you hear what he said to Steve the other
day?" asked Clive. "No, what?"

358
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:01,190
"'Dominic told Steve that he got the top job
because Ann and Gary saw him as a wise ambassador.'"

359
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:07,009
"Wise? Ambassador? Ambassador for what?"

360
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:10,149
"Who knows? He's in his own dream world."

361
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,239
"Did he really say that?"

362
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:17,780
"Yes. And when Steve questioned it, Dominic
then said he was older than anyone else anyway."

363
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,129
"Unbelievable."

364
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:25,149
"Who knows what he thinks? He's not like us.
I think that scares him."

365
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:28,670
"Where do these people come from?"

366
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:35,549
"I don't know, mate, but they soon move on.
We just have to hold on. Look on the bright

367
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:39,409
side - it couldn't get any worse."

368
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:45,850
But Eddie wasn't so sure. Eddie had the feeling
that things were going to get a lot worse.

369
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,190
And he was right.

370
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:54,239
Back at home, Eddie spent the evening trying
to catch up on the work he'd missed that afternoon,

371
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:59,649
and looking at the many emails he had sent
Dominic. It was a nightmare.

372
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:03,999
Again and again he considered walking away
from the job, but it hurt him more simply

373
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:09,950
to give up. Besides, he was enjoying the Moscow
project, and he had done so much work for

374
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:15,710
it. When he was in Moscow, he could get on
with things. He loved Russia and he loved

375
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:22,120
the people there. It was such a different
world from the UK; and the owners of Zariya,

376
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:29,009
Dima and Tatiana, always made him feel so
welcome. Over time Eddie had had to explain

377
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:34,529
to them some of the difficulties back in London,
and they had been very helpful. Eddie was

378
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:39,659
reading one of Dima's emails and smiling again
when Lynn walked into the room.

379
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,749
"Will you be much longer?" asked Lynn.

380
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:48,529
"Maybe. I'm behind on some deadlines, and
today's battle with Dominic didn't help."

381
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,879
"Just leave it now, Ed. Come to bed," said
Lynn.

382
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:55,649
"I can't. There's so much. Too much."

383
00:29:55,649 --> 00:30:01,450
"There's always too much," Lynn replied. "It
will still be there in the morning. Give yourself

384
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,450
a break."

385
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,340
"Yeah, well, that's true, but with Dominic
I have to be extra careful. He picks on everything."

386
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,169
"He's an idiot."

387
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:16,139
"Yeah, I know it, and you know it, and everyone
else knows it, but he's still the boss."

388
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:19,659
"Well, what I mean is just ignore him."

389
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:25,380
"How can I ignore him, Lynn? He's the boss!
He runs the division. He runs me."

390
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,759
"Well, don't let him," said Lynn.

391
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,730
"I'm not letting him!" shouted Eddie. "I'm
trying to stop him. That's the problem!"

392
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,929
"There's no need to shout, Eddie. I'm not
deaf."

393
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:39,200
"Well, you're not being very helpful."

394
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,450
"Thanks a lot," she said sarcastically. "I'm
doing my best."

395
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,970
"Sorry. I was hired to build a team, win a
project like the one in Moscow and make things

396
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,519
profitable. He was brought in to oversee the
whole division. Then he gets bonuses for doing

397
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,360
very little, and I get the blame when the
numbers suddenly don't add up."

398
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,399
"Your numbers are fine."

399
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,970
"Not according to Dominic."

400
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,970
"Why?"

401
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:12,690
"Oh, well, during our useless meeting today,
he brought up that old story about being 25,000

402
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,230
pounds over budget, when everyone knows he
fixed the numbers. Somehow he gets his bonuses

403
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:24,169
and puts any blame on me. I'm almost certain
now that he wants me out, Lynn."

404
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:30,730
"Surely not. He needs you. If it weren't for
you, good people would have left ages ago.

405
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,570
Besides, who else could move Russia along?"

406
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,220
"Oh, don't mention Russia."

407
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,470
"Why? That's your big success story."

408
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:45,100
"Oh, he keeps going on about the fact that
he won the Moscow contract, not me."

409
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,240
"What? That's just not true."

410
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,769
"I know."

411
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:53,109
"What about Ann and Gary? Can't you talk to
them about all this?"

412
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:59,769
"They've changed, Lynn. I've hardly seen them
since the new partners came in. Besides, Gary

413
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:06,220
and Dominic are always playing golf at the
weekends. Ann's OK still, but she's very political,

414
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,970
and I think she's embarrassed that Dominic's
upsetting everyone. After all, she was the

415
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,639
one who recruited him."

416
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,489
'And Human Resources? Can't you report him
to them?"

417
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:20,980
"What do I tell them? That he's got the people
skills of a goat!"

418
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,320
"Well, that's one thing. And the intimidation,
the lies and the..." It's very hard to prove,

419
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,220
Lynn. He's got his back covered, and they
would only report the whole thing to Ann and

420
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,379
Gary. And then what?"

421
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:38,740
"Well, presumably they tell Dominic and you
all get together and sort it out."

422
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,279
"Easy, really. Why didn't I think of that?"

423
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,649
"You know what I mean, Eddie. There's no need
to be sarcastic. I'm only trying to help.

424
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,000
I hate it when you're like this."

425
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,809
"Well, you're not living in the real world,
are you, Lynn? You're a Primary school teacher,

426
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:59,350
for goodness' sake. If things go wrong, you
all get into a circle and sing a song about

427
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,779
it. Or draw a picture. It's not that simple
when you're in a multi-million pound business

428
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:04,820
and..."

429
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,950
But Lynn had heard enough.

430
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:14,320
She was already leaving the room. Eddie stared
back at the open screen on his laptop at hundreds

431
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,389
and hundreds of emails. He thought about how
much more he had to do before he could go

432
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:25,320
to bed, about the hurt he had caused Lynn
and about the injustice of Dominic and of

433
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,429
people like him.

434
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,440
Eddie slammed down the laptop lid.

435
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,980
The job was broken, the evening was broken,
and now his relationship was broken.

436
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,950
CHAPTER FIVE
Eddie's dream

437
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,159
Although the sea was calm, Eddie didn't sleep
well. He had a dream that seemed to last all

438
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,159
night.

439
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,629
It began with him lying in bed in the cabin
of the ship, and waking up to find himself

440
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:58,750
in his old bedroom from his childhood. But
the bedroom was on the ship. He sat up in

441
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:04,129
the top bunk of some familiar bunk beds. In
the bottom bunk should have been his sister

442
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:10,480
Ellen, but he knew his wife was the occupant
now. The bottom bunk was empty, however, and

443
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,430
he saw water coming in quietly but rapidly
under the door.

444
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:21,080
In his dream, he jumped out of his bunk and
straight into half a meter of water. It was

445
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:28,210
ice-cold and Eddie gasped in shock. He was
wearing a grey suit and black shoes, but no

446
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:34,160
socks, shirt or tie. With his feet already
going numb in the cold water, he opened the

447
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,230
small wardrobe to look for them and found
a public telephone. Business cards were stuck

448
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,040
all over the wall. He noticed his own from
years ago with the familiar Fentons logo.

449
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,410
But his details were in Russian.

450
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,850
His stomach was tight.

451
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,919
His head ached.

452
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,610
In his dreaming mind, a thousand tasks and
deadlines seemed to weigh upon his shoulders.

453
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,250
The phone started ringing. He picked it up.

454
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,740
"Where are you?" a voice shouted on the other
end.

455
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,960
It was Dominic.

456
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,180
"The unmistakable, cold, demanding tone of
voice: "Do you know what time it is?"

457
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,730
Eddie lifted the sleeve of his suit to look
at his watch, but its face was frosted over

458
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,830
and unclear. Water had got into it somehow.
The hands were barely visible.

459
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,900
"I can't tell," he heard himself say.

460
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:29,570
"You can't tell the time? Typical! What's
the matter with you? We're all waiting for

461
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,960
you. Come on."

462
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,260
"Who's waiting for me? Where are you?"

463
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,600
Eddie heard laughter in the background.

464
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,120
"On the bridge. Where do you think?" Then
the line went dead.

465
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,050
The water was up to Eddie's knees now, and
rising fast. He decided to leave the socks,

466
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,070
shirt and tie and make his way to the bridge
- dressed or not dressed. How much worse could

467
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,700
it be?

468
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,740
As Eddie opened the door, water poured in
at waist level, and with it thousands of champagne

469
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:06,180
glasses. Most of them were intact, but many
were broken. Too many for Eddie to avoid.

470
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,470
His chest and legs were cut many times as
he waded out into the corridor.

471
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,370
He saw Clive at the far end.

472
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:18,300
"Clive!" he shouted. "Clive, it's me! Over
here!"

473
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,530
But Clive didn't hear him. He, too, was struggling
with the strong current of water dragging

474
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,990
him down and away at the far end of the corridor.

475
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,790
"CLIVE!" shouted Eddie in his sleep.

476
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,850
Opposite Eddie in the dream was a metal ladder
which went up to the next level of the ship

477
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:41,910
through a small hole. It was big enough for
him to get through. This ladder led to another

478
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,491
ladder and another hole. And another. And
another. Ladders stretched all the way in

479
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:53,900
a giant tunnel leading upwards. Eddie climbed
and climbed. He could hear the laughter getting

480
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,600
louder, so he decided to follow the sound.

481
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,290
When he reached the top, he suddenly found
himself on the ship's funnel. It was dark,

482
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:09,480
and a strong sea wind took his breath away.
He was scared and excited at the same time.

483
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,320
He thought the funnel would be hot, but it
was not. It was at an angle, and he was looking

484
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,960
up into the sky, almost touching the stars
themselves.

485
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,810
"They're stars, Lynn. Not lights. You were
wrong," he shouted again (in reality, his

486
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,440
shouting woke Lynn up).

487
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,720
Then he looked around and saw that the front
part of the ship was already underwater and

488
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,620
the ship was sinking.

489
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:39,720
"Lynn!" he shouted. This time it was a scream.
That was when he slipped and fell and, in

490
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,870
his sleep, flung out his arms to save himself.
But there was no impact. Instead he was now

491
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:51,130
standing on the bridge of the ship, which
was full of people from work - from his days

492
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:56,250
at Fenton's. People he hadn't thought of in
all this time. People he thought he'd never

493
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:01,620
remember again. People he certainly didn't
want to see again.

494
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,360
Ann and Gary were there, but they were behind
Dominic, who stood by the wheel in his captain's

495
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,300
uniform staring at him. He was older now and
heavier. The way Eddie had seen him at the

496
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
bar.

497
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,110
"Glad you could join us. We're only sinking,
you know!"

498
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:23,210
"What's going on?" said Eddie, looking around.
The jazz band was playing in the corner, but

499
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,911
the female singer was not the girl he had
seen earlier. Instead it was Lynn. Singing

500
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:30,610
a song whose name escaped him.

501
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,760
"Lynn?"

502
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,900
She didn't look at him. She was looking away
and singing.

503
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:42,290
"LYNN! What are you doing here?" shouted Eddie,
confused and frightened.

504
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,540
"I'm the captain. What does it look like?"
said Dominic.

505
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:53,990
"No. Not you. Lynn. What's she doing here?"
She wasn't paying him any attention.

506
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,840
More and more people were coming on to the
bridge. He saw Dima and Tatiana. They spoke

507
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,660
in Russian. Eddie couldn't hear them over
the laughter of the crowd.

508
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,950
"Ssh. I can't hear what they're saying. And
I can't remember the name of the song."

509
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,700
"Never mind that, Eddie. We've got more important
things to do."

510
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
"What?"

511
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Laughter.

512
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,110
"We're sinking, no thanks to you."

513
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,610
"Why? What have I done?"

514
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,900
More laughter from the crowd.

515
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,750
A familiar face appeared. It was Neal.

516
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,160
"Champagne glasses, Eddie. Champagne glasses,"
he said.

517
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,910
"What about them?"

518
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:34,650
What about them?" shouted Dominic. "They put
a hole in the ship, you fool."

519
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,310
"That's impossible." Fear filled Eddie's mind
and body.

520
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:45,460
"Oh, really? Take a look around. Glass everywhere.
Holes in the side of my ship."

521
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,650
"It's not your ship!" protested Eddie.

522
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,620
"Who cares? We'll be underwater in ten minutes.
Fifteen at the most," added Neal.

523
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,570
"Shut up, Neal. You're only here because of
Dominic."

524
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,350
Then he heard a loud buzzing.

525
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:07,480
A giant helicopter arrived and flew over the
front decks. And another. Three, four, five.

526
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,540
Dozens. Like bees around a beehive. Buzzing,
louder and louder. They flew around and shone

527
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,570
powerful lights on to the bridge. So many
lights. The noise and lights were unbearable.

528
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:26,410
Then sirens. Police sirens. People screaming.
Eddie covered his ears and shut his eyes.

529
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,280
He cried out: "LYNN!"

530
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,500
The noise lessened but the lights were bright,
so bright. He was trying to open his eyes,

531
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,190
but he couldn't. Now someone was pulling at
his arms.

532
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,650
"Let me go! Let me go!" he shouted.

533
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,160
"Eddie..." Lynn said, trying to wake him up.

534
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,930
"Lynn?" His eyes were opening. It was so bright.

535
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,740
"It's all right, I'm here," she said, holding
him.

536
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,450
"We've got to get off! We're sinking!"

537
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,770
"It's all right," she said again.

538
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,570
Then his eyes opened and he was finally awake.

539
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,060
CHAPTER SIX
Another bad meeting

540
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:13,370
The next morning Eddie woke early and his
mind was racing. The house was quiet and there

541
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,730
was little traffic outside. He felt like he
hadn't been to sleep at all, and he was still

542
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,810
angry.

543
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:26,270
Lynn was still asleep. It was 5.50 a.m. He
listened to the radio for a while until he

544
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:33,510
heard the news, and then he got up, had a
shower and got dressed. By 6.45 a.m. he was

545
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,120
ready for work and quickly said goodbye to
Lynn before walking to the station to get

546
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,230
the train into central London.

547
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,350
The train was full, but Eddie managed to get
a seat by the window. It was a fast train

548
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:52,120
with only a couple of stops before Paddington.
As the train picked up speed and aimed for

549
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:58,240
the city, Eddie looked out at the fields and
industrial estates passing by. He took deep

550
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,940
breaths and tried to calm himself before the
day started. He thought about his conference

551
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:10,180
call with Moscow at 9.30 a.m., his scheduled
sales meeting at 12 noon, and a lunch appointment

552
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:16,420
at 1.30 p.m. with Neal Skinner in Production.
Then he was hoping to block off a couple of

553
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,210
hours in the afternoon to catch up on emails
and paperwork.

554
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:27,860
He got to the office at 8.15 a.m. and sat
at his desk with a double espresso and a bagel.

555
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,650
As his PC started up, Eddie sorted through
some of his papers and wrote a quick to do

556
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:39,690
list for the day ahead. He logged on to his
email and took care of a few basic queries,

557
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,110
before noticing that Dominic had sent a meeting
schedule for 10 a.m. There was no subject

558
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:50,780
heading. Eddie saw that it clashed with his
Moscow call, so he rejected it and suggested

559
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,630
rescheduling for 11 a.m., and wrote a line
to ask what the meeting was about. To support

560
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,540
his message, he mentioned that he had an important
call at 9.30 a.m. and asked Dominic for his

561
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,550
patience in the matter. It annoyed him to
think that his day with Dominic was already

562
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,770
starting on a negative note, but he tried
to put it to the back of his mind.

563
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:19,070
By 9 a.m. the open-plan office was filling
up, and Maxine, Paula and Gavin arrived, who

564
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,300
all worked in Eddie's department and sat near
him in the office.

565
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,510
"Hi, Ed! How's it going?" asked Paula.

566
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,370
"Fine, thanks," replied Eddie.

567
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:33,900
"How was the meeting with Dominic yesterday?"
asked Gavin. "Oh, well, you know. A challenge,

568
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,080
shall we say," said Eddie, trying to smile
and not give too much away.

569
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:44,090
"I bet it was. Rather you than me, mate,"
said Gavin. Eddie knew that Gavin and the

570
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,450
team were on his side, but what could they
do?

571
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,160
Eddie went back to dealing with his emails
and preparing for the call to Moscow at 9.30

572
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
a.m.

573
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,130
At 9.20 a.m. his phone rang. It was Dominic.
"Did you get the meeting schedule I sent?

574
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,600
10 a.m. this morning."

575
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,530
"Yes, I replied. I can't do that time. I've
got a call at 9.30 with Dima and his team

576
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:11,880
in Moscow. I'm dialing in Adam in IT, who
needs an update on the platform they're using

577
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,310
for the new software."

578
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,590
"It's too early for IT. Why are you bothering
them with this?"

579
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,690
"Because we need their input on..."

580
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,040
"Look, Eddie. Forget IT and forget your call.
Do it tomorrow."

581
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,400
"I can't. It's taken ages to find a time when
we can all..."

582
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,000
"You and I have a meeting at 10."

583
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,150
"What about?"

584
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,690
"Let's discuss that then. OK?" Dominic hung
up.

585
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,870
Eddie glanced around and noticed Maxine looking
at him.

586
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,050
"You OK?" she asked.

587
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:48,910
"Not really. Max, can you get hold of Dima
for me and ask if he can reschedule the call

588
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,780
for any time this afternoon?"

589
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,410
"He won't like it," she said.

590
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:59,430
"I know. Tell him I'm really sorry, and tell
him Dominic has to see me at 10 a.m. Tell

591
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:05,320
him I didn't have any warning. He'll understand."
Eddie tried to smile again. This smile was

592
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,930
more fake than the last, and Maxine could
see it.

593
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,510
"OK," she said.

594
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:16,220
Eddie calmly got up out of his seat and walked
across to the far side of the office floor,

595
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,650
took the lift upstairs and went into the gents'
toilet. It was empty.

596
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:26,700
He went to the sink, turned on the cold tap,
collected water in his cupped hands and splashed

597
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:33,260
it on his face to freshen up. The situation
was impossible, he thought. Eddie felt he

598
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,570
could no longer do his job.

599
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,120
For a moment or two he stayed where he was,
leaning over the sink, staring at the pouring

600
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,430
water and watching it go down the plughole.
Then he looked up, reached for some towels

601
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:47,840
and dried his face.

602
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,940
At that moment the phone in his pocket announced
the arrival of a text with the sound of a

603
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,820
mystical harp. It was from Lynn.

604
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,970
sorry about last night, hope u r ok. stay
strong. D is a useless robot and he knows

605
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,080
it. love u. L. x

606
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,770
Eddie smiled and punched back a quick reply:

607
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,820
thanks, love u 2. X

608
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,440
The text and cold water seemed to give Eddie
enough strength to go back and face another

609
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,450
meeting with Dominic. It was almost ten o'clock.
He had enough time to grab a coffee before

610
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,470
going to Dominic's office.

611
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:32,540
Eddie knocked on the door, walked in and sat
down. Dominic was engrossed in something on

612
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:38,700
his PC. Without looking up he muttered, "I'll
be with you in a moment," and spent the next

613
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,940
five minutes doing more work and ignoring
Eddie. He even made a phone call to someone

614
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:49,750
Eddie had never heard of. Eventually, Dominic
turned his attention away from his computer

615
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,350
and on to Eddie.

616
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,980
"Right. What's the latest from Moscow?"

617
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,340
"I haven't called them yet."

618
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,740
"Why not?" Dominic's tone was sharp. Eddie
was always amazed at how unpleasant and cold

619
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:07,640
this man was. Was he like this at home? What
kind of friends did he have? Did he have any

620
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
friends?

621
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,150
"I had a call planned for this morning at
9.30, but you asked me to change it so that

622
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,490
we could have this meeting."

623
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,330
"So when are you talking to them?"

624
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,510
"I don't know yet," said Eddie.

625
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,240
"You need to get a call sorted as soon as
possible."

626
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,760
"Maxine's doing that now."

627
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,360
"Maxine shouldn't be doing that sort of thing.
She's only a temp."

628
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,520
"Well, she sometimes takes phone calls for
us in the office and sets UP meetings."

629
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:39,441
"She's not a secretary, Eddie, she's a student!
She types in data. You can't ask her to phone

630
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,970
our biggest customers..."

631
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:46,690
Eddie's face was red, he could feel it. Already
things were out of control.

632
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,320
"She's only setting up a conference call,"
he said.

633
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,580
"Do it yourself," said Dominic impatiently.

634
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,540
"Fine," Eddie. It wasn't fine at all.

635
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,900
"And copy me in on the schedule. I want to
join the call."

636
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,900
"Why?"

637
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,400
"I want to find out when Dima's going to order
the rest of the software for all the offices

638
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
in the region."

639
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,220
"Dominic, please leave that to me. This call
is more for product training and looking at

640
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,740
any specific problems so far. I don't want
to distract him with pressure for more orders.

641
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,480
We have time for that."

642
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,480
"We don't have time, Eddie."

643
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:29,070
"Yes, we do. At least until my next visit
to Moscow. That's when we will be looking

644
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:33,920
at the next orders. As a matter of fact I've
got a meeting with Neal in Production today

645
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
to look at costs."

646
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,530
There was a knock on the door and Neal Skinner,
Head of Production, walked into the office.

647
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:47,480
"Well, well. Here he is!" said Dominic. "Come
in, Neal. We were just talking about you."

648
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,480
"Nothing bad, I hope," said Neal. His smile
was insincere.

649
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,660
He was a very tall, thin man who always looked
pale and wore dull suits. The Grey Man, they

650
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,830
called him in the office. Neal was Eddie's
main contact in Production for all things

651
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,510
related to the Moscow project.

652
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:13,551
He was a cold character who took himself very
seriously and had little sense of humor. Like

653
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:19,840
Dominic, he had a superior manner and was
stubborn. When engaged in conversation he

654
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:25,090
looked at the other person critically, judging
them negatively. Neal always tried to give

655
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:30,140
the impression that he knew everyone and that
he was in charge, but it was clear he was

656
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,630
not really comfortable in his role and didn't
really know what he was doing. He hid behind

657
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:40,520
business jargon, name-dropping and things
he had learned from going on too many training

658
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,470
courses. But bosses liked him. Employees and
customers did not. They thought he was a waste

659
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,970
of time. Eddie knew he was a waste of time.

660
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,110
"Neal, thanks for joining us."

661
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:59,440
"No problem," Neal replied. So agreeable.
So good with a boss around. Neal crossed his

662
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,260
long legs and folded his arms.

663
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,230
Eddie now had a feeling that this meeting
had been arranged, and that Neal was part

664
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,490
of it. It was no coincidence that he had turned
up at that point.

665
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:15,480
"Did you see the match last night?" Neal asked
Dominic. Still no smile.

666
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,281
"No, I missed it. I heard that new defender
Slater scored an own goal and saved us. That

667
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:23,170
was very kind, thank you."

668
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,030
"We're still five points ahead of you, though."

669
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:30,980
"Not for long. You've got Chelsea on Saturday,
and then you're away to Liverpool the following

670
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,110
week."

671
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:37,790
"Gentlemen," interrupted Eddie, "if it's OK
with you... could we get back to business?"

672
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:44,940
"The thing is, Eddie," said Dominic, "we need
more people on the Moscow account..."

673
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,980
Eddie wasn't sure where this was going, but
he was slightly encouraged by the possibility

674
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:54,780
of getting more assistance. "Right. That's
good," he said, trying to be positive. "We're

675
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:00,310
short-staffed, as you know, and we could use
more help." But he still wasn't sure why Neal

676
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,290
was there - he remained still and quiet, looking
first at Dominic and then at Eddie.

677
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:12,960
"... so Neal has agreed to take charge and
give you guys a hand." Dominic looked back

678
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,400
at his computer screen, then tapped something
on his keyboard. Eddie looked at Neal.

679
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,220
"Take charge of what, exactly?" he asked,
looking back at Dominic.

680
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:29,540
"Take charge of the account. In Moscow." Dominic
gave a little laugh.

681
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:35,690
Eddie went cold. He could feel the sharp blade
of realization enter his back. "Are you moving

682
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,350
to Moscow, Neal?" he asked, confused but hopeful.

683
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:46,400
"No, mate. I'm staying in London." Neal smiled
his superior smile.

684
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,230
Eddie did not like the sound of this. He didn't
like being laughed at either.

685
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,290
Eddie turned his attention to Dominic. "Dominic,
I don't quite follow. What's going on?"

686
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:01,690
"I've decided to make some changes in the
team. Neal has a lot of experience in this

687
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:06,830
field, so you will report to him. He is now
Head of Product and Business Development.

688
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:10,590
It's a new position."

689
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:15,510
Neal kept his eyes on Dominic the whole time.
He looked very pleased with himself, as if

690
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,090
he was waiting to be given a trophy of some
sort.

691
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,320
'It makes sense, Eddie. Really," said Neal.

692
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,780
"I'm not interested in your opinion," snapped
Eddie. He was trying to stay calm but inside

693
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:32,720
he was ready to explode. He tried to keep
his voice steady. He leaned forward on Dominic's

694
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,060
desk and looked him in the eye.

695
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,180
"So what's my position?" he asked.

696
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,770
CHAPTER SEVEN
An encounter in Barbados

697
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:50,210
The Parvina docked quietly at Bridgetown,
Barbados, at 7.20 a.m. Eddie and Lynn were

698
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,750
already awake and they lay in bed listening
to the radio. At 7.30 there was a knock on

699
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,750
the door.

700
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,710
"Good morning. Breakfast," said the voice
outside.

701
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,940
Eddie got out of bed, almost believing he
would step into cold water once more, and

702
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:11,280
opened the door. A young, smiling man brought
in a large tray full of cereals, orange juice,

703
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,710
pastries and a cafeteria of coffee. Eddie
led him through the cabin to the balcony door,

704
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:20,490
which he opened. The humid air struck him
immediately.

705
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:27,710
"Phew, it's warm. Leave the tray inside,"
he said to the man. "Thanks." Eddie gave him

706
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,200
a few dollars and the man left.

707
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,830
Eddie looked out across the harbour view to
where blue sea met white sand, to the houses

708
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:41,670
dotted about the town, and to the green palm
trees inland. Market stalls were already being

709
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:47,570
set up near the ship, where locals could sell
souvenirs and fruit to the passengers. Eddie

710
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:52,740
heard the distinctive metallic sound of a
steel band and saw five boys playing down

711
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:59,000
below. He could see at least three other ships
in the harbour. Given his nightmare, he really

712
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,330
appreciated the fact that this was the reality.

713
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:07,500
"Good morning, Mrs Millionaire. Another day
in paradise," he said.

714
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,000
"What's for breakfast?" asked Lynn, yawning.

715
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,580
"Get up and have a look."

716
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,400
"You seem very awake and lively," she said.

717
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,930
"Yes, well, after last night's trip to hell
and back, this comes as a relief."

718
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:25,750
"You were in a terrible state. Do you remember?"

719
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:31,070
"Yes. I'm trying not to think about it," said
Eddie. And he really was trying not to think

720
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:36,700
about it - about the dream, about Dominic
Stephens, about the real nightmare of sixteen

721
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,960
years ago. But he knew it wouldn't be easy.

722
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,860
"Damn him," he said under his breath.

723
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,180
Lynn and Eddie had decided to do different
things that day. Eddie had chosen to go on

724
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:55,060
a catamaran and snorkeling trip in the morning,
while Lynn had booked tennis lessons. They

725
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,930
took a taxi to the Tropical Beach Hotel and
Spa, where they were welcomed with fruit punch

726
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:04,170
and given a short talk about the area by one
of the hotel guides.

727
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:10,410
The catamaran was scheduled to depart from
the hotel's private beach at 10.30 a.m., and

728
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:15,270
Eddie put on his life jacket and joined several
other passengers and hotel guests for the

729
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:21,090
two-hour trip. He was given a mask, snorkel
and fins, and he waved to Lynn as he walked

730
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:26,160
down to where the boat was tied up. He was
carrying his deck shoes and had a towel in

731
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:33,010
his hand as he made his way, barefoot, across
the fine, smooth sand.

732
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,590
As he waited his turn to get on board, he
looked down at his feet in the warm, green

733
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:42,540
water and thought again about the nightmare
and about Dominic. He wondered where Dominic

734
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:47,850
was today. Was he on a trip? Was he even still
on board?

735
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:52,020
In the taxi on the way to the hotel, Eddie
had worried that Dominic would be on the same

736
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:58,130
excursion. But how likely was it that he would
meet him? He started feeling angry again that

737
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:02,360
Dominic was on the ship. And that he still
existed at all.

738
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:07,360
In spite of this, Eddie was able to relax
during the boat trip. After an hour of sailing

739
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:13,090
around the bay and past some spectacular beaches
and coves, the catamaran dropped anchor and

740
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:19,080
the small group went snorkeling near an old
shipwreck. They watched and fed some stingrays,

741
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,880
and Eddie enjoyed the calming effect of being
below the surface and in a very different

742
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,630
world underwater. He was a good swimmer and
very fit. He had swum for his school and his

743
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:35,670
university, and he had won medals for long-distance
swimming. Even now, at home, he tried to get

744
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:38,850
to the local pool at least twice a week.

745
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:43,520
When he got back to the beach hotel, he was
feeling tired but refreshed. He'd caught the

746
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,250
sun too, and his forehead and nose were burnt.
He found Lynn sitting on a sun lounger by

747
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:54,060
a small pool with fountains. She was reading
and sipping another fruit punch.

748
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:58,110
"Hello, you. I thought I'd find you here,"
he said.

749
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,630
"Oh, hi. How was it?"

750
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,630
"Brilliant."

751
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,710
"You've caught the sun."

752
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:08,840
"I know. I forgot to take some decent sun
block. I borrowed some off the guys on the

753
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,000
boat, but I think it was too late."

754
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,641
"Here," she said, reaching for some cream
in her bag. "Use some of this." She passed

755
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:22,400
him a tube of cream and Eddie squeezed some
into his hand and rubbed it on his face.

756
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,720
"How was the tennis?" he asked.

757
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,030
"It was cancelled. The guy never turned up,
and it was too late to get another trainer."

758
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:33,380
"Really? That's not good. We've already paid
for it."

759
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:39,250
"I know," said Lynn, "but they're giving us
lunch for free instead, so I don't mind really.

760
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:43,000
I'm booked for tennis again in St Lucia in
a few days, so that's OK."

761
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,130
He mocked her: "Listen to you! I 'm booked
for tennis again in St Lucia in a few days,

762
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,520
she says, sipping her cocktail." Then he said,
"This is the life, eh?"

763
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,080
"It certainly is. Oh, look, here's Jen."

764
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,830
"Who's Jen?" asked Eddie, looking around.
He thought she looked familiar.

765
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:07,650
"She was booked for the tennis as well, so
we came here for a drink instead and we started

766
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,700
chatting. You'll never guess who she is."

767
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,800
"I know her, don't I?" asked Eddie.

768
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,770
"Yes and no. The same thing happened to me
when I first saw her."

769
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:23,220
"She's from the ship. She must be," he said.
Jen was almost at the pool where they were

770
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,220
sitting.

771
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,190
"Yes. Not only that. She's the singer in the
band!"

772
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:33,830
"Oh yes!" said Eddie, turning to meet her.
She had on wide sunglasses and a baseball

773
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,910
cap. She wore a colourful sarong with palm
tree patterns, and her T-shirt was orange

774
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:44,000
with a black saxophone logo. She was carrying
a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the

775
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
other.

776
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,070
"Hi, Lynn. Is this your man then?" asked Jen.

777
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,790
"Yes, this is Eddie. Eddie, this is Jen."

778
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:57,250
"Nice to meet you, Jen," Eddie said, shaking
her hand.

779
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,110
"Likewise," she said. "How was the boat trip?"

780
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:05,470
"Great, thanks. They took us around some fabulous
beaches. Then we stopped and swam off the

781
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,890
reef near an old shipwreck."

782
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,350
"Cool!" said Jen.

783
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:12,880
"Some stingrays came by and we were given
some food for them."

784
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,910
"Oh, I'd love to do that, but I'd be terrified,"
said Jen.

785
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:21,710
"They're not that dangerous actually, although
they can give you a nasty bite."

786
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,870
"Ugh!" said Lynn.

787
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,700
"Or sting with their tail," added Jen.

788
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:31,710
"Yeah, well, that's true. It's rare, though,"
said Eddie. "That usually happens if you stand

789
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,280
on one when they're buried in the sand in
shallow water."

790
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,010
"Aren't you afraid of sharks?" asked Jen,
lifting up her sunglasses.

791
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:43,180
"I try not to stand on sharks," said Eddie,
smiling.

792
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,410
"You know what I mean."

793
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:49,490
"There weren't any in the area we were in,"
said Eddie, sitting down on a sun lounger

794
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,140
next to his wife.

795
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,580
"How do you know?" asked Lynn.

796
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,690
"Well, you don't. You have to hope that there
aren't any."

797
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,020
"You must be mad," said Jen.

798
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,620
"It's worth it. The fish you can see near
the reef are so beautiful."

799
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,650
"Well, Jen and I have been doing as little
as possible, haven't we, Jen?"

800
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,850
"Absolutely," said Jen, sitting back on her
lounger and sipping her drink.

801
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:16,120
"So, no tennis, then?" asked Eddie.

802
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,690
"No," said Jen. "But we get a free lunch,"
she added.

803
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,790
"So I heard," said Eddie. "What are you doing
later?"

804
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,300
"Well, my partner will be here soon and we're
booked to go on the Island Safari."

805
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,370
"Oh, I saw that in the brochure," said Lynn.
"Is that the trip where you get a private

806
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:35,630
jeep and go around the island and see the
Wildlife Reserve?"

807
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:42,290
"Yes, that's it. I love all the animal trips.
I can't wait. Dominic isn't keen at all, but

808
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:47,460
he says he doesn't mind as long as he gets
his golf, Typical! It's like he's married

809
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:55,220
to the stupid game. I find it so dull. He
loves it, though. Do you play golf, Eddie?"

810
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,200
CHAPTER EIGHT
Eddie's departure

811
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:04,760
"So, what's your position?" asked Clive later
that evening at Eddie house. Eddie had come

812
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,470
straight home after the meeting and no one
had been able to reach him. Clive had been

813
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:13,440
worried, and so he ha called in to see Eddie
after work.

814
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,350
"That's what I said," replied Eddie.

815
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,950
"And what did he say?" asked Clive.

816
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:26,170
Lynn, clearly angry and upset, interrupted
at this point to add, "Oh Clive, listen to

817
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,420
this..."

818
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:33,520
Eddie was trying to stay calm. He was in shock.
"He couldn't give me a straight answer. He

819
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:39,560
went on and on about budget control, an Neal's
experience in Austria when he was with Gallagher's."

820
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:45,130
"Neal doesn't do anything. And Austria is
very different from Russia. Doesn't he realize

821
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,000
that? This project is completely different."

822
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,210
"I know, Clive, I said all that. There was
nothing I could say. When I got a chance to

823
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:58,530
speak, he either didn't listen or simply interrupted.
Or Neal joined in with a useless reason to

824
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,700
justify himself. It was pathetic to watch."

825
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,620
"No one at Gallagher's has a good word to
say about Neal, or the work he did in Austria.

826
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:12,230
In fact, the rumor is that he was sacked because
he messed it up. That's how he got into Fenton's

827
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:17,540
in the first place. He needed a job and Dominic
is an old mate of his from university. It

828
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,990
makes me sick."

829
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:24,950
"I know." That was all Eddie could say. He
was so tired. He rubbed his eyes.

830
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:30,730
"So there's no position for you?" asked Clive,
but he could see the answer coming.

831
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,800
"Right," said Eddie.

832
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,780
"They're making you redundant, then?"

833
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,780
"No."

834
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,520
Clive was confused, and Eddie could not bring
himself to say any more. So Lynn continued

835
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,970
for him. "They fired him," she said.

836
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,190
There was a brief silence.

837
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,030
"They what"

838
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:54,600
"Can you believe it? It's disgusting," said
Lynn.

839
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,470
Clive turned to Eddie. "I don't believe it,"
he said.

840
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:02,260
"Neither do I," said Eddie, staring into space.

841
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,420
"Fired for what?"

842
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:10,330
"He's using the issue about the 25,000 pounds
in last year's budget, but he also said I

843
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:14,170
was a negative influence on the project and
not hands-on enough'."

844
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:21,660
"You have got to be joking!" Neither Eddie
nor Lynn said anything. It was no joke.

845
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:27,610
"You're very hands-on. The other day he said
you were too hands-on, didn't he?"

846
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,810
"Exactly," said Eddie.

847
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:33,440
"And in what way are you negative? You are
more enthusiastic and positive than the two

848
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,660
of them put together," said Clive.

849
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,190
Eddie didn't say anything.

850
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:44,860
"He just wants a yes-man," continued Clive.
"Neal is the true corporate yes-man. He plays

851
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:50,030
the game and does what he's told. But he's
useless otherwise, and too frightened to say

852
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,680
anything and rock the boat."

853
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,660
"Who would want to be like that?"

854
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:58,961
"These guys think they're above everyone else.
It's as simple as that. They have no idea

855
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:04,150
what other people really think of them. They
either scare you so you won't tell them, or

856
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,640
they just talk over you in case they look
weak."

857
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,980
"Meanwhile, Neal gets a job and Eddie doesn't,"
said Lynn.

858
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:18,330
"It's funny, but I really don't care anymore,"
said Eddie. "They deserve each other. I don't

859
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:23,910
want to be a part of their grey world with
their grey suits and grey ideas. They have

860
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,300
no imagination. Only a selfish need to justify
themselves."

861
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,790
"They can't do this, surely?" Lynn asked Clive.

862
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,860
"They can and they have."

863
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,670
"But it's unfair dismissal. You can take them
to a tribunal."

864
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:41,770
"I'm not sure I can cope with that," said
Eddie.

865
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:45,630
"But you have to," said Lynn. "You've got
to fight it."

866
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:51,310
"All I do with him is fight. Now he has Neal
to do his fighting. And he says he has the

867
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,170
full support of Ann and Gary, so they're no
help."

868
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:59,860
"You should have played more golf, Ed," said
Clive sarcastically.

869
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:04,331
Eddie thought about that for a moment and
then said, "Now that I have no job, maybe

870
01:05:04,331 --> 01:05:07,000
I'll have the time."

871
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,230
The next morning Eddie went into the office
early again to clear his desk. There were

872
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:18,950
only a few people there. He saw Adam from
IT, who came over to him. He noticed Eddie

873
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,480
was busy emptying drawers and throwing files
and old documents away.

874
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,720
"Hi, Ed, how's it going? Doing a spring clean?
Good man. Long live the paperless office!"

875
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,410
"Not exactly, Adam. I'm leaving, as a matter
of fact."

876
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:36,040
"No way!" he said. "I had no idea."

877
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:41,940
"Me neither," said Eddie, reaching for a folder
and glancing quickly at its contents. He got

878
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,690
halfway through and then threw the folder
into the bin.

879
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,440
"What's happened?"

880
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:52,430
"I was fired yesterday," said Eddie. The words
sounded unreal when they came out.

881
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:53,810
"What for?"

882
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,200
"Oh, it doesn't matter."

883
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,700
"You're one of the best people here, Ed. I
mean it."

884
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:05,710
"Thanks, Adam, but they don't want the best
here. They just want..." Eddie stopped for

885
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:12,070
a moment and looked across the office, deep
in thought. "You know what, Adam, I have absolutely

886
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:17,550
no idea what they want." He turned and looked
at Adam. "And do you know what the worst thing

887
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,550
is?"

888
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,550
"What?"

889
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:24,820
"They don't know either. My guess is they
just want to be in charge. Nothing else matters.

890
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:30,140
They just want to move people around and feel
important," said Eddie, slamming a cupboard

891
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:35,040
door shut and pushing his chair away from
the desk. "They don't think about the people,

892
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:40,310
their work, their customers. They don't care
about loyalty. They don't care about building

893
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:46,170
a business. They talk, have meetings and play
golf, but they don't know the business and

894
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:49,030
they know they need us to make it work."

895
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:55,290
"You know your problem," came a voice from
behind them. "You were never a corporate man,

896
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,290
Eddie."

897
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,720
It was Neal. Eddie was completely taken by
surprise. He was both embarrassed and furious

898
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,540
to see him standing there.

899
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:08,770
Adam started walking away. "Look, Ed, I'll
catch you later," he said. "Let's have a drink

900
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,740
before you go, OK?"

901
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:15,840
"Sure," said Eddie, who decided to ignore
Neal and finish clearing his desk.

902
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:21,260
"You need the skin of a crocodile in this
business, I'm telling you." Eddie tried to

903
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:27,650
ignore him and carried on throwing away files,
paper, software manuals. Everything.

904
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:34,650
"Besides," continued Neal, "Dominic needs
someone like me. Someone more... academic.

905
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:40,840
He needs someone who can talk to him." Eddie
stopped and looked at him. Was there no end

906
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,480
to Neal's patronizing arrogance?

907
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,870
"Neal, you're deceiving yourself. Dominic
wants a yes-man. Pure and simple. Now he's

908
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,830
got one. Congratulations."

909
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,620
"You're upset."

910
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:56,510
"No, really? Amazing. How did you guess?"

911
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:01,120
"Look, I don't have a problem with you. It's
nothing personal."

912
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:06,490
"That's so generous of you, Neal. I feel so
much better," said Eddie, moving up close

913
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:13,050
to him. He could smell Neal's stale cigarette
breath. "Well, I have a big problem with you,

914
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:20,239
and, believe it or not, I am taking this very
personally. I guess I'm human, not a crocodile.

915
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:21,670
What would you rather be?"

916
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:24,569
"I know how you feel," said Neal.

917
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:30,699
"You have no idea how I feel, and don't talk
to me about how to talk to people like Dominic.

918
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:37,049
He needs someone more academic, indeed. What
does that mean? And corporate. What is corporate?"

919
01:08:37,049 --> 01:08:39,650
"You have to play the game, Eddie."

920
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:44,309
"Maybe. But I'm not interested if the end
result is turning into a grey yes-man like

921
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:50,409
you. Ask yourself the question: are you true
to yourself? I wonder."

922
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:57,119
"Nice, Eddie. Very professional," said Neal,
finally showing his irritation.

923
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:03,180
"And you know all about professional, do you?
Open your eyes. Really open your eyes. Listen

924
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:08,409
to what people say about you. You're deceiving
yourself and I actually feel sorry for you.

925
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:15,230
And if you want a second opinion, go and ask
people here or your old friends at Gallagher's."

926
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:20,559
Neal was walking away now, so Eddie shouted
after him: "Did they give you a good reference,

927
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:27,549
by the way? It wasn't redundancy, was it?"
Eddie carried on putting things in his bag

928
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:32,210
before sitting down to write an email to all
his customers and colleagues to inform them

929
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,869
of his departure.

930
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:36,440
CHAPTER NINE
The fight

931
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:44,369
As Dominic Stephens came out of the hotel
towards them, Eddie froze. He looked at Lynn

932
01:09:44,369 --> 01:09:49,859
and her face said the same. Before they could
make an excuse to leave, Dominic was already

933
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:56,050
on the cafe terrace. His hair was grey and
combed back, and he was wearing white trousers,

934
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:02,199
grey golf shoes and a green polo shirt which
was too tight for his large stomach.

935
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:08,059
It was definitely Dominic. The same hard face
but now with a dark tan, though his chin and

936
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:13,640
cheeks were fuller than the last time Eddie
had seen him. He looked older and different.

937
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:21,860
"Hello, everyone. New friends, I see," he
said, putting out his hand. In a reflex action,

938
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:27,559
Eddie noticed his hand go out to shake Dominic's.
He instantly felt he had betrayed himself.

939
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:33,389
Dominic's handshake had not changed: his palm
at an angle, the fingers locked tight, difficult

940
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:36,849
to grip. Do Not Enter, it said.

941
01:10:36,849 --> 01:10:43,510
Again, automatically, Eddie lifted his sunglasses
to be polite, but Dominic kept his on. Eddie

942
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:49,090
waited for the moment when Dominic would recognise
him. But he did not. This cannot be true,

943
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:54,480
he thought. Is this really Dominic? After
all this time, am I shaking hands with him

944
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:00,579
and he does not know me? He looked at Lynn,
who was shaking his hand, too. Eddie could

945
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:02,999
see that she was not comfortable either.

946
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:07,650
"Nice to meet you," she said, putting on her
best smile.

947
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:13,000
"How was the tennis?" Dominic asked, leaning
on the back of Jen's chair.

948
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,590
"Cancelled," she said. "Then I met Lynn and
we've been working hard on cocktails since

949
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,999
we got here."

950
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:22,499
"Ah, it's a hard life," he said.

951
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:28,760
Yes, thought Eddie. It can be very hard. And
some people make it harder. His head was quickly

952
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,320
filling up with flashes of memory. Angry words
and images.

953
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:38,019
"So, what are you guys going to do?" asked
Dominic.

954
01:11:38,019 --> 01:11:41,090
"Er, we've got to get back to the ship," said
Eddie.

955
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:44,050
"I thought you were staying for the free lunch,"
said Jen.

956
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:48,800
"Ah, there's no such thing as a free lunch,
eh, Eddie?"

957
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,199
Eddie wasn't sure if Dominic had recognised
him. Maybe. Maybe not. Or maybe he was unsure

958
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:58,820
and was playing for time? He never showed
much emotion, and behind the dark glasses

959
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,789
he looked almost robotic.

960
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:06,860
"I don't really know," said Eddie. He was
still trying to recover from the shock of

961
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:10,429
Dominic standing there in front of him after
so long.

962
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:16,869
"Sure. I've been in business twenty-five years
and I can tell you no lunch is free."

963
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:21,020
"Right," said Eddie. "Right, well, nice to
meet you both."

964
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,040
"Come on," said Jen, "stay for lunch."

965
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,999
"No, really, I've had too much sun, I think,"
said Eddie.

966
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:31,179
"Well, we can sit in the shade," said Jen.

967
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:35,510
"No, I mean I don't feel too well," Eddie
said.

968
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:40,530
"Hmm..." said Dominic, finally lifting up
his glasses and having a good look at Eddie's

969
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:47,280
face, "... your nose is burnt, but you do
look quite pale otherwise. You look like you've

970
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,789
seen a ghost."

971
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:56,239
Eddie looked into Dominic's eyes. He did not
see any signs of recognition. He looked away.

972
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,270
"Right. Yes. Anyway. Lynn?" he said.

973
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:03,699
"Yes," she said, standing up. "I'm coming."

974
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:07,929
"Well, maybe we could meet for a drink after
I finish tonight?" asked Jen.

975
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:11,409
"She's a great singer, isn't she?" said Dominic.

976
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:13,409
"Yes," said Eddie.

977
01:13:13,409 --> 01:13:14,780
"Wonderful," said Lynn.

978
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:20,170
'I'm off at about eleven, so I'll come over
to the bar and we can meet you both then."

979
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:23,619
"We'll see how Ed feels," said Lynn.

980
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:30,760
Sure. Well, tomorrow then? Or breakfast?"
Dominic was laughing. "We're stuck together

981
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:36,449
on the ship for the next two weeks, so there's
no getting away, is there?"

982
01:13:36,449 --> 01:13:41,280
Eddie had never imagined Dominic on holiday.
He only remembered that Dominic always came

983
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,800
back from holidays complaining about the children.
"Ah, it's good to be back in the office,"

984
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:52,630
he used to say, "away, from the kids." Eddie
felt sorry for Dominic's family whenever he

985
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,300
heard him say that.

986
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,869
"What would his kids say if they heard him
say that?" Eddie had once asked Clive. "Why

987
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:04,400
did he have kids or a family at all if he
preferred to be in an office?"

988
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,050
"Because these guys like to be the center
of the universe, and kids and partners take

989
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:14,619
that away from them. Besides, family life
and kids are all about showing emotion, and

990
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:20,679
they find it too scary. That's why they hide
behind desks and power. Can you imagine Dominic

991
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:25,239
or Neal trying to be with their kids? They
don't know how. They probably didn't know

992
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:28,000
how to be with kids when they were kids."

993
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,920
"That's so sad," Eddie had said.

994
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:36,579
"They are sad. They've missed the best things
in life and think money and status are enough.

995
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:41,349
But they are so superior in their own minds
that they don't know it."

996
01:14:41,349 --> 01:14:44,329
"So they're actually happy? Ignorance is happiness?"

997
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:51,560
"Maybe. I'm not so sure. How often do you
see these guys relax, laugh or even smile?"

998
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,560
"True."

999
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,110
"Well, there's your answer."

1000
01:14:54,110 --> 01:15:03,749
"Eddie?" Lynn's voice suddenly brought Eddie
back to reality. "Eddie? Are you coming?"

1001
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:08,020
"Yeah. Sorry," he said. "See you guys later."

1002
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:12,350
"Bye," said Jen and Dominic together.

1003
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:17,010
Eddie and Lynn walked back through the hotel
to the taxis. As they went back to the port

1004
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,600
and the ship, Lynn spoke first.

1005
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
"Well?"

1006
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:26,660
"He looks older. He's still got that arrogant
look. And he's put on a lot of weight." Eddie

1007
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,099
glanced out of the window.

1008
01:15:28,099 --> 01:15:31,599
"Are they married, do you think? What happened
to his wife?"

1009
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:36,499
"Don't know," said Eddie. "I hope she left
him. For her sake."

1010
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:39,920
"I wonder what Jen is doing with a man like
him, then?"

1011
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,809
"Goodness knows. He's old enough to be her
father."

1012
01:15:42,809 --> 01:15:48,920
The taxi moved along the harbour and passed
the yachts in the marina. Eddie was shaking

1013
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,980
his head in disbelief.

1014
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,030
"I don't believe it, Lynn," he said. "Can
you believe it?"

1015
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:59,800
"No. But at least he doesn't remember you,"
she said, looking at him. Eddie kept staring

1016
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:05,469
out of the window. "Do you think not?" he
said. "Oh, come on. It's over sixteen years,

1017
01:16:05,469 --> 01:16:09,420
Ed. If he had remembered you, he would have
said something - don't you think?"

1018
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:16,260
"Not necessarily. You never know with him.
I never knew with him. He's a snake. A fat

1019
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,019
snake now, of course. But still a snake."

1020
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:21,429
"Maybe he's changed," said Lynn hopefully.

1021
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:23,559
"I doubt it."

1022
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:29,010
The taxi slowed down and stopped near the
gangway for the Parvina. They paid the driver

1023
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,570
and got out.

1024
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:36,690
"It doesn't matter if he's an angel now. I'll
never forgive him. The three things I hate

1025
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:41,730
most in the world are arrogance, bullying
and betrayal. He's guilty of all three."

1026
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:47,130
"Well, let's hope he doesn't remember you.
We don't have to see them anyway."

1027
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:53,410
"He's with the singer of the ship's band,
Lynn - we'll see him every night!" Lynn walked

1028
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:59,440
in silence on to the ship and into the reception
deck. What could she say?

1029
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,449
That night Eddie and Lynn had dinner in the
main dining room, which was full, as it was

1030
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:08,679
every night. As the sun went down and the
room got darker, Eddie found it harder to

1031
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:14,409
see if Dominic was in the room or not. Throughout
dinner he had expected him to turn up, but

1032
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:15,480
he was not there.

1033
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,570
As they finished dessert and drank their coffee,
however, Dominic appeared and took a seat

1034
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,289
at the bar to watch Jen.

1035
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:24,829
"There he is," said Eddie.

1036
01:17:24,829 --> 01:17:29,280
"Oh yes. Well, maybe we could go back to the
cabin, or the casino."

1037
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,639
"No, Lynn. We're not letting him push us around
again."

1038
01:17:33,639 --> 01:17:36,150
"But he'll soon see us and come over."

1039
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,949
"I doubt it. He was always antisocial."

1040
01:17:38,949 --> 01:17:41,150
"Maybe he's changed."

1041
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:46,039
"You keep saying that. People like him never
change."

1042
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:51,010
Eddie sipped his coffee and said, "I think
I need to know for sure if he remembers me.

1043
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:52,039
I'd feel a lot happier."

1044
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:56,499
"But why, Ed? What good will that do?" she
asked.

1045
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:58,300
"I can't explain."

1046
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:03,830
"Eddie, please... Look, he's leaving anyway.
He's not going to bother us."

1047
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:08,400
But Eddie had already got up from the table
and was walking over to the bar and the exit

1048
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,739
to follow him.

1049
01:18:09,739 --> 01:18:14,369
He followed Dominic down the corridor and
past the Starlight Lounge, where people were

1050
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:19,880
playing cards and reading. He followed him
through the door, out on to the side deck

1051
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:25,210
and to the stern of the ship. It was dark,
and Eddie thought he had lost him. But then

1052
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:31,400
he swelled the unmistakable cigar smoke and
he saw him. The earlier breeze had been replaced

1053
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:38,389
by a strong wind and the sea was quite rough.
He noticed Dominic in a small area, alone,

1054
01:18:38,389 --> 01:18:42,929
sheltered from the wind, leaning on to the
rail and looking out to sea.

1055
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:46,070
"Hello," said Eddie, walking up to him.

1056
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:49,630
"Oh, hello there. Getting some fresh air?"

1057
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:50,809
"I suppose so."

1058
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:56,929
"Me too," said Dominic. "Feeling better?"
he asked.

1059
01:18:56,929 --> 01:18:58,510
"Yes, thanks."

1060
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:03,369
They both looked out to sea together for a
long minute. Eddie broke the silence.

1061
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:08,010
"You don't remember me, do you?" he asked,
looking at Dominic.

1062
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:14,199
"Yes, I just asked if you were feeling better.
We met at the hotel today. Your wife's tennis

1063
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:15,199
was cancelled."

1064
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,159
"No, not here. Back home. At work."

1065
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:25,460
"What do you mean?" asked Dominic, looking
at Eddie. "Where?"

1066
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:31,140
Eddie knew Dominic had been in many companies.
Creeping his way in, then getting thrown out.

1067
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,710
Dominic called them redundancies. Others knew
better.

1068
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,660
"Fenton's."

1069
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:41,429
Dominic looked at him and then looked harder,
using the light coming from the spotlight

1070
01:19:41,429 --> 01:19:46,150
on the wall. "What's your surname?" he asked.

1071
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,880
"Munro."

1072
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,780
Dominic appeared to be trying to remember.

1073
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,460
"I was in sales. There was the big project
at Zariya in Moscow."

1074
01:19:54,460 --> 01:20:05,139
"Ah," said Dominic. "Eddie Munro. Yes." He
smoked his cigar some more, buying time. "When

1075
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,510
was that?" he asked finally.

1076
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:10,099
"Sixteen years ago."

1077
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:13,159
"Wow, good memory," said Dominic.

1078
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:19,119
"Not really..." said Eddie, "... you fired
me and it's not something one forgets."

1079
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:25,849
"Did I?" and Dominic actually laughed. Over
the years Eddie had imagined meeting him again

1080
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:29,579
and confronting him. He had never imagined
the man laughing.

1081
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:35,860
"You did, yes. You found a way to blame me
for a budget loss of 25,000 pounds."

1082
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:41,820
"It's a long time ago. I honestly can't remember,"
said Dominic, still smoking, looking back

1083
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:47,670
at the sea. Eddie was staring at him. His
mouth was dry. He was trembling.

1084
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,659
"Well, I remember."

1085
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:54,949
"Good for you," said Dominic, and now his
tone was changing.

1086
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:57,480
Less interested. Colder.

1087
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:04,110
"Actually, I remember you were an incompetent
bully. You made my life miserable."

1088
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:09,900
Dominic turned around and looked at Eddie.
"Is that so?" It was too dark to see if he

1089
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:14,530
was angry or not. Eddie felt that the situation
was getting out of control, but there was

1090
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:17,820
no turning back. The words were coming out
on their own.

1091
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:24,530
"I was very successful at Fenton's," said
Dominic firmly, "and one reason was probably

1092
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:28,550
because I was able to get rid of useless rubbish
like you."

1093
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:33,690
"They fired you from there eventually, I heard.
Why was that?"

1094
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:39,710
Dominic started walking away. "An interesting
reunion, my friend, but it's late and I'm

1095
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:45,619
bored with this conversation. I suggest you
leave the past in the past and move on."

1096
01:21:45,619 --> 01:21:49,130
Eddie grabbed his arm. He felt Dominic's body
stiffen.

1097
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:54,550
"Get your hands off me," Dominic said, putting
his cigar in his mouth to free his hand.

1098
01:21:54,550 --> 01:22:01,710
"I moved on, Dominic. I moved on after you
took away my job, my money, my peace of mind

1099
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,300
and almost my wife."

1100
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:08,159
Eddie was angry now. The words were not coming
out right any more.

1101
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:15,039
"I've seen your wife, Eddie," Dominic said,
laughing. "I can tell you that you still need

1102
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,639
to move on."

1103
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:22,369
"What does that mean?" This time Eddie pushed
him against the rail of the ship and hit the

1104
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:28,429
cigar out of Dominic's mouth. The light was
shining on Dominic's face, and Eddie saw a

1105
01:22:28,429 --> 01:22:30,420
mixture of surprise and anger.

1106
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:36,079
"Hey! What is your problem?!" he shouted,
but they were out on deck in the wind and

1107
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:41,050
darkness and it was like a whisper. Dominic
pushed back against the rail, but Eddie would

1108
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:42,810
not let him move.

1109
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:48,900
"You! You are my problem!" Eddie shouted.
He had no idea what he was doing any more.

1110
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,510
He was scared, and angrier than he had been
for a long time.

1111
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:55,550
"Move away, Eddie. This is unacceptable."

1112
01:22:55,550 --> 01:23:03,619
"Unacceptable? Unacceptable? Oh, really? So,
after all these years you know what is acceptable

1113
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:10,469
and unacceptable. What you and Neal Skinner
did to me was unacceptable. The way you patronized

1114
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:18,320
and intimidated me was unacceptable. You cheated
and lied. You were so smug, so superior."

1115
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:24,309
"I was the boss. I made tough decisions. You
were a casualty. It happens in business. Sink

1116
01:23:24,309 --> 01:23:27,650
or swim, my friend. Get over it."

1117
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:33,420
Without thinking, Eddie brought his knee hard
and fast up into Dominic's groin. Dominic

1118
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:38,039
shouted out in shock and blinding pain, but
was able to push his hand hard into Eddie's

1119
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:43,679
face. Eddie lost his balance for a moment,
giving Dominic time to stand up straight.

1120
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,880
Dominic pushed Eddie in the chest, but Eddie
did not feel it. He was too busy getting his

1121
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,769
hands around Dominic's neck. He squeezed and
squeezed, and Dominic tried to get himself

1122
01:23:54,769 --> 01:24:00,320
free. But he could not. Eddie's hands were
locked around Dominic's throat. He dug in

1123
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:05,679
his nails to be sure. He pressed his thumbs.
Dominic was trying to speak, but he couldn't.

1124
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,789
He choked out some words but Eddie could make
no sense of them.

1125
01:24:09,789 --> 01:24:18,730
"Just shut up! Shut up! You stupid... arrogant
man!" Eddie growled at him.

1126
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:23,630
Eddie could finally see fear in Dominic's
face, which had gone pale, and his eyes stared

1127
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:28,560
back at him. Eddie could see he was going
to pass out, so he loosened his grip. What

1128
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,940
am I doing? he thought. This is madness.

1129
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:38,010
But the moment he let go, pain suddenly shot
into Eddie's ear as Dominic threw a punch

1130
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:43,551
to the right side of Eddie's head, and then
to his right side into his ribs. Eddie was

1131
01:24:43,551 --> 01:24:49,440
wild and angry once more, this time pushing
Dominic back on to the ship's rail. Hard against

1132
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:56,789
the rail. Fast against the rail. Dominic shouting
in pain once more. Eddie punching and punching.

1133
01:24:56,789 --> 01:25:07,079
"OK, OK, enough, enough. Stop," pleaded Dominic,
his arms up in defense.

1134
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:12,260
Eddie stopped. He loosened his grip again
and waited for a reaction from Dominic, but

1135
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:19,300
none came. Eddie stood back and watched Dominic
try to stand up against the rail. Dominic

1136
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:24,739
was holding his stomach and breathing heavily.
He coughed a couple of times. His head was

1137
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:26,699
down.

1138
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:32,239
Eddie was out of breath himself. He hadn't
been in a fight since he was fifteen. It felt

1139
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:39,360
just the same even as an adult - tiring, frightening
and sore. That time there was a crowd watching.

1140
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,840
This time there was no one.

1141
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:50,880
"Don't come near me or speak to me again...
ever. Do you hear me?"

1142
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,539
Dominic was still trying to get his breath.
Either he could not speak or he did not want

1143
01:25:55,539 --> 01:26:01,511
to. But he said nothing. Eddie took one last
look at him and backed away until he was at

1144
01:26:01,511 --> 01:26:06,429
a safe distance. Then he left the deck and
went back inside.

1145
01:26:06,429 --> 01:26:12,659
That was the last time anyone ever saw Dominic
Stephens.

1146
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:17,449
CHAPTER TEN
Sinking not swimming

1147
01:26:17,449 --> 01:26:22,909
For a few days after his dismissal from Fenton's,
Eddie actually felt quite excited. He was

1148
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:28,510
relieved. A great weight had been lifted from
his shoulders. But this feeling did not last

1149
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:34,340
long, and he soon started to feel irritable
and, later on, angry.

1150
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:39,800
For weeks he couldn't get Fenton's and Neal
and Dominic out of his mind. He thought over

1151
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:46,070
and over again about the injustice of it all.
He thought about all the arguments and frustrations.

1152
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:51,679
All the work he had done. All the work he
could have done. Wasted. He missed his colleagues

1153
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:56,739
and a sense of belonging, and he missed going
to Russia and working with Dima and the team.

1154
01:26:56,739 --> 01:27:02,760
To cheer himself up, he tried to remind himself
that, apart from people like Dominic, there

1155
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:08,519
were things he would not miss, like emails.
On the day Eddie left Fenton's for the last

1156
01:27:08,519 --> 01:27:14,820
time, there were over four hundred unanswered
emails in his inbox. Eddie always tried to

1157
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:20,920
get back to people, but it had become impossible.
Every time he got rid of one email, a dozen

1158
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:26,469
more would appear within half an hour. The
world had gone mad, he thought. At first,

1159
01:27:26,469 --> 01:27:31,840
like everyone else, Eddie had welcomed the
new form of communication. It was neat, cheap,

1160
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,960
fast and flexible. But soon it dragged him
down. He didn't like to admit it, but Dominic

1161
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,999
was right about not reading emails. They were
never-ending.

1162
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:42,400
Dominic.

1163
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,670
Back in his mind again.

1164
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,600
Many times he had terrible thoughts about
what he would like to do to Dominic, and to

1165
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,610
Neal for that matter. He thought of storming
into the office and using Dominic's own golf

1166
01:27:55,610 --> 01:28:01,010
clubs to smash up computers and break windows,
and then going into the car park and doing

1167
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:07,369
his worst on Dominic's Mercedes. The shiny
paintwork, the windows - all slashed, scratched

1168
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:13,519
and broken. It felt good but his conscience
would not let him.

1169
01:28:13,519 --> 01:28:17,780
In the end, he followed Lynn's advice, which
was to get out of the house more and go for

1170
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:23,389
walks, or go swimming. Keep busy. Get some
exercise. They lived two miles from their

1171
01:28:23,389 --> 01:28:27,949
local sports center, so every morning Eddie
got up with Lynn and then walked through the

1172
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:32,940
park to the pool at the sports center. He
made this his morning routine, but he couldn't

1173
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:38,130
get used to being in a swimming pool on a
weekday morning at 10 a.m. He normally swam

1174
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:43,420
after work, so it was strange for him to find
the pool almost empty, except for some elderly

1175
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:49,349
swimmers and sometimes small school groups.
As he sat in the cafe afterwards, drinking

1176
01:28:49,349 --> 01:28:55,469
a coffee or two, he always felt better. He
wanted to stay there all day and hide. Then

1177
01:28:55,469 --> 01:28:59,250
his heart would sink at the thought of heading
home to nothing.

1178
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:04,820
In fairness, Eddie had started looking for
jobs in the same week that he was fired. But

1179
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:13,079
as depression set in, he lost interest and
motivation. Then, to his alarm, he lost confidence.

1180
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:18,050
In a way, this was worse than the depression,
but these were all new feelings and he was

1181
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,929
overwhelmed. Everything he had done seemed
meaningless, and he wondered how he would

1182
01:29:22,929 --> 01:29:25,760
ever do a serious job again.

1183
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,380
He and Lynn had enough money saved to last
for about four months, but the time soon passed

1184
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:36,249
and there were no vacancies. His chances with
the best companies in his sector were also

1185
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:40,690
harmed by the news of his dismissal over the
budget fiasco.

1186
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:47,599
By the time there were a couple of opportunities,
Eddie was physically unwell and his doctor

1187
01:29:47,599 --> 01:29:53,599
had agreed he was not fit for work. It took
time for sickness benefits to be paid, and

1188
01:29:53,599 --> 01:29:58,789
with the two of them living on Lynn's small
teaching salary the financial pressures grew.

1189
01:29:58,789 --> 01:30:04,650
Bills turned into reminders. Reminders turned
into final reminders. And final reminders

1190
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:11,659
became phone calls from angry gas and electricity
companies, TV companies and insurance companies.

1191
01:30:11,659 --> 01:30:17,630
Then finally the bank called. Eddie was having
a bad day anyway. This was the last thing

1192
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,780
he needed.

1193
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:26,249
"Hello, Mr Munro, this is CNTS bank. May I
ask you some security questions?" said a young

1194
01:30:26,249 --> 01:30:27,249
male voice.

1195
01:30:27,249 --> 01:30:31,619
"Not really," said Eddie. He almost hung up
straight away.

1196
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:36,900
"I just want to ask you some security questions
and then talk to you about your account,"

1197
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,130
the voice insisted.

1198
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:42,949
"Well, how do I know you're the bank? You
could be anyone," said Eddie. He had decided

1199
01:30:42,949 --> 01:30:46,710
to stay on the phone, but he wasn't going
to make it easy for the person at the other

1200
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:47,710
end.

1201
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:50,460
"I can assure you this is the CNTS bank calling."

1202
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:55,739
"OK, then, well I can assure you that this
is Mr Munro. What do you want?"

1203
01:30:55,739 --> 01:31:00,900
"I can't do that, Mr Munro. I need to ask
some security questions."

1204
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:05,269
"Well, my bank told me not to give my security
questions away."

1205
01:31:05,269 --> 01:31:06,729
"Mr Munro..."

1206
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:13,320
"Ah, you don't know I am Mr Munro yet, do
you?" said Eddie. "When is your date of birth?"

1207
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,179
"I'm not telling you that until you prove
you are the bank."

1208
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:20,659
"All right, sir, ask me a question about your
account."

1209
01:31:20,659 --> 01:31:22,920
"OK, how much money is in my account?"

1210
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:28,579
"I can't tell you that. I have to ask you
some security questions first." Eddie hung

1211
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:29,920
up.

1212
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:36,309
Thirty seconds later the phone rang again.
Eddie considered ignoring it, but he was bored

1213
01:31:36,309 --> 01:31:39,979
and was enjoying being in control for once.
"Hello?"

1214
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:44,139
"Good morning, Mr Munro. This is CNTS bank..."

1215
01:31:44,139 --> 01:31:46,360
"Hi, how are you?"

1216
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:52,309
The voice didn't know what to say for a moment,
but then sprang back into action. "I'm fine,

1217
01:31:52,309 --> 01:31:54,030
thank you, sir."

1218
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:58,829
Eddie had to admit that the young man was
professional. If he was annoyed, he was hiding

1219
01:31:58,829 --> 01:32:05,480
it well. Eddie felt a little guilty - the
man was only doing his job. Then he thought

1220
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:11,650
of Dominic and Neal and what bosses like them
would do to such youthful enthusiasm. He realized

1221
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:17,239
that the voice was still speaking, but Eddie
wasn't paying attention. "Sorry? I wasn't

1222
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:18,380
listening," he said.

1223
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:23,449
"That's OK, sir. I was just saying that we
need to talk to you about your account, and

1224
01:32:23,449 --> 01:32:26,360
I can get my supervisor if you wish."

1225
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,229
Eddie decided to give some ground. This was
getting boring.

1226
01:32:29,229 --> 01:32:33,960
"Go on, I believe you. You're CNTS bank. What
do you want?"

1227
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:39,800
"Thank you, Mr Munro. I just need to ask you
some security questions. Is that OK?"

1228
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,800
"Fine."

1229
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,580
"Thank you. Can you confirm your telephone
banking password?"

1230
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,580
"Chinatown."

1231
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:51,090
"Thank you. And can you give me the second
and last numbers in your security code?"

1232
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,650
"Eight and three."

1233
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,829
"Thank you, Mr Munro."

1234
01:32:54,829 --> 01:32:56,570
"You're welcome."

1235
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:58,820
"That completes the security with you."

1236
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,880
"I'm so pleased."

1237
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:06,989
"I was calling because your account had insufficient
funds to pay some direct debits this month,

1238
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:11,090
and your credit card with us is now stopped
until you make further payments."

1239
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:14,190
"Great. Thank you for telling me. Goodbye."

1240
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:22,199
"No, Mr Munro. You are currently overdrawn
by 3,478.11 pounds, and the balance on your

1241
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:31,110
credit card is 4,490.30 pounds I have to ask
if and when you will be making payments into

1242
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:32,550
your account."

1243
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:38,749
"I have no idea. I've lost my job and I can't
work. I'm thinking of doing the lottery on

1244
01:33:38,749 --> 01:33:43,191
Saturday, so give me a call on Monday and
I'll tell you if I can pay you or not. If

1245
01:33:43,191 --> 01:33:46,380
it helps, I'll enter my bank account number
and see if it wins."

1246
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:52,409
"Mr Munro, my supervisor is here. He would
like to have a word with you. Would that be

1247
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:53,409
OK?"

1248
01:33:53,409 --> 01:33:56,210
"Not really." Eddie hung up.

1249
01:33:56,210 --> 01:34:01,329
This time the phone did not ring again, which
surprised Eddie in a way. He walked slowly

1250
01:34:01,329 --> 01:34:06,590
into the kitchen, made a coffee, picked up
the newspaper and sat in an armchair to flick

1251
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:10,280
through the pages to see what was on TV.

1252
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:14,639
CHAPTER ELEVEN
After the fight

1253
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:18,749
Eddie went back inside the ship and made his
way to the toilets, where he locked himself

1254
01:34:18,749 --> 01:34:25,190
inside a cubicle. He was shaking and sweating.
He sat down and put out his hands in front

1255
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:31,010
of him, watching the shaking in fascination
and fear. He could feel the pain in his chest

1256
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:37,039
now, and his ear was sore. He wiped his face
with the palm of his hand; there was blood

1257
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:43,679
coming from his nose. He used some toilet
paper to stop the bleeding. He felt exhausted.

1258
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:49,729
Eddie stayed where he was for about ten minutes.
The toilets were empty and no one else came

1259
01:34:49,729 --> 01:34:55,559
in during that time. He almost expected Dominic
to come in, and he imagined the fight starting

1260
01:34:55,559 --> 01:35:02,340
all over again. A struggle by the sinks, mirrors
breaking, doors slamming.

1261
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:07,010
He decided to make his way back to the dining
room. He came out of the cubicle and looked

1262
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:12,170
in the mirror to straighten his clothes and
his hair. The bleeding had stopped. He washed

1263
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,170
his face.

1264
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:20,170
The dance floor was full and the dining area
was being cleared. Lynn was at the table talking

1265
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:22,579
to some other guests when Eddie found her.

1266
01:35:22,579 --> 01:35:28,550
"Hello, stranger," she said. "You took your
time. Where's Dominic?"

1267
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:33,210
Eddie wasn't ready for a conversation about
this right now. "I couldn't find him."

1268
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:35,309
"So where've you been all this time?"

1269
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:40,079
"I went to get some fresh air, then I went
over to the Starlight Lounge and checked some

1270
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:41,199
emails on the internet."

1271
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:46,340
"Eddie, you're on holiday!" she said, putting
her arm around him.

1272
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,729
"I know. Sorry."

1273
01:35:47,729 --> 01:35:50,469
"Come on, what do you want to drink?"

1274
01:35:50,469 --> 01:35:53,530
"I'll have a large scotch. No ice."

1275
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:54,530
"Really?"

1276
01:35:54,530 --> 01:36:01,820
"Well, why not? We're on holiday." Eddie tried
to smile. His ear and nose were stinging.

1277
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:05,110
His chest ached. Maybe he had a broken rib?

1278
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:10,780
"OK. Wait here. I'll get them," she said,
and Eddie turned to watch the dancing and

1279
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:17,280
the band. He was calmer now. The shock felt
less. He glanced over at the band and saw

1280
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:23,340
Jen looking at him, and she gave a small wave.
He waved back, but suddenly wondered if she

1281
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:31,530
was in fact waving to Dominic somehow. He
looked behind him, but Dominic wasn't there.

1282
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:36,130
When Lynn came back, they had their drinks
and danced for a while. Eddie was tense the

1283
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:41,249
whole time, waiting for Dominic to launch
a sudden attack on the table. Or maybe he

1284
01:36:41,249 --> 01:36:46,039
had gone back to his cabin to rest and would
wait until tomorrow or the next day to continue

1285
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:47,409
the fight.

1286
01:36:47,409 --> 01:36:50,769
"I wonder where Dominic is?" said Lynn.

1287
01:36:50,769 --> 01:36:56,949
"No idea," said Eddie. "Come on. I'm tired.
Let's go to bed."

1288
01:36:56,949 --> 01:37:01,110
Even as they reached the cabin, Eddie was
looking around for Dominic, but he knew now

1289
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:06,620
that he must have gone to his own cabin. He
felt relieved as they walked in, and he sat

1290
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,699
down on the couch.

1291
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:13,929
Lynn was looking in the mirror, taking off
her necklace and earrings. In the mirror she

1292
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:18,150
watched Eddie sitting down. "You OK?" she
asked.

1293
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:19,809
"Not really."

1294
01:37:19,809 --> 01:37:22,730
"What happened to your face?"

1295
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:30,050
Eddie laughed briefly. He suddenly saw the
absurdity of it all. "I had a fight with Dominic,"

1296
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,980
he said, looking at the bruises on his hands.

1297
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,780
"You mean you had an argument?"

1298
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:42,059
"No, I mean I had a fight. A proper fight.
You know, where people hit each other a few

1299
01:37:42,059 --> 01:37:47,210
times." He was trying to laugh again. But
the tears in his eyes and on his cheeks were

1300
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:52,920
not happy ones. Lynn stopped what she was
doing and came to sit beside Eddie.

1301
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,320
"You're shaking."

1302
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,320
"Yeah."

1303
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,830
"What happened?" she asked.

1304
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:05,769
"To be honest, I can't really remember. It
all happened so fast. We were outside on deck

1305
01:38:05,769 --> 01:38:11,170
one minute, and the next I was trying to strangle
him." Eddie made a strangling gesture with

1306
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:14,320
his hands, and again he saw that they were
shaking.

1307
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,320
"What?"

1308
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:21,699
"I know. I can't really believe it myself.
At one point I think he was going to pass

1309
01:38:21,699 --> 01:38:24,320
out. I almost pushed him over the side."

1310
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
"Eddie!"

1311
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,739
He was shaking his head.

1312
01:38:27,739 --> 01:38:31,380
"Was anyone watching all this? You must have
looked like madmen."

1313
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:34,389
"No. It was just us. By the lifeboats."

1314
01:38:34,389 --> 01:38:37,769
"Where is he now?" asked Lynn.

1315
01:38:37,769 --> 01:38:42,860
"I don't know. I thought he followed me back
inside, but he must have gone back to his

1316
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,540
cabin."

1317
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:46,340
Lynn got Eddie a glass of water.

1318
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:49,070
"Thanks," he said. "Sorry."

1319
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:56,400
"I can't believe this. You're like a pair
of kids. It's one thing to find him on board,

1320
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,230
but it's another to start fighting like kids
in a playground."

1321
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:01,920
"He started it," said Eddie.

1322
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,630
"Listen to yourself, Ed!"

1323
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:06,159
"I know."

1324
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:11,150
"Look, it's a shock that he's on the same
cruise, I admit, and I know it brings it all

1325
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:16,949
back. But I thought the plan was to keep a
low profile now. Ignore him. Forget him."

1326
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:20,420
"How can we forget him when he's on the same
cruise ship?"

1327
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:27,429
"Well, we'll have to manage, and I suggest
we wait and see what happens. If he approaches

1328
01:39:27,429 --> 01:39:32,860
you at breakfast or something, don't get involved.
Apologise and walk away."

1329
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:33,929
"Apologise?!"

1330
01:39:33,929 --> 01:39:39,969
"OK, well, maybe not apologise. Just ignore
him. Promise?"

1331
01:39:39,969 --> 01:39:44,559
"Yes, I promise," said Eddie.

1332
01:39:44,559 --> 01:39:50,159
CHAPTER TWELVE
Lynn and Eddie argue

1333
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:54,909
Six months had passed since Eddie's departure
from Fenton's, and no work offers were coming

1334
01:39:54,909 --> 01:40:01,769
in. Summer was over and the evenings were
getting darker. Eddie had lost weight and

1335
01:40:01,769 --> 01:40:07,520
his relationship with Lynn was in a bad way.
Either they argued over most things or they

1336
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,510
didn't speak at all.

1337
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:15,659
One Thursday afternoon Lynn came in from work
and Eddie was sitting in his armchair as usual,

1338
01:40:15,659 --> 01:40:22,400
watching a TV show from America. A couple
and their neighbours were arguing over a dog.

1339
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,920
Lynn was soaking wet. The rain was heavy outside.

1340
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:33,059
"These people are so stupid," he said, not
looking up. "This guy says he can't sleep

1341
01:40:33,059 --> 01:40:37,570
because of his neighbours dog, and the neighbour
says the other guy's been shooting at it with

1342
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:38,940
an air rifle!"

1343
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:45,030
"It's OK. I'm fine, thanks. Don't get up,"
Lynn said, putting down heavy shopping bags

1344
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:47,199
as she came through the front door.

1345
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:52,690
"So this guy..." Eddie continued, "... the
guy with the dog, is suing the other guy for

1346
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:56,190
a hundred thousand dollars in damages!"

1347
01:40:56,190 --> 01:41:01,349
Lynn was neither interested nor amused. She
took off her coat, picked up the bags and

1348
01:41:01,349 --> 01:41:06,140
went into the kitchen. On the way, she threw
the post on to the sofa.

1349
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:12,230
"But the other guy - the guy with the gun
- he's suing the dog owner because he says

1350
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:16,619
the dog barks all night and messes up his
garden."

1351
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:21,739
Eddie knew he had already upset Lynn, but
he stayed where he was. She was always upset

1352
01:41:21,739 --> 01:41:26,880
these days. He decided to shout out the rest
of his commentary so that Lynn could hear

1353
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,190
him in the kitchen.

1354
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:33,360
"And now their wives are complaining that
the men are obsessed with arguing with each

1355
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,949
other. They've been fighting over the dog
for three years, and now they both want a

1356
01:41:37,949 --> 01:41:40,099
divorce."

1357
01:41:40,099 --> 01:41:42,820
Eddie heard Lynn say something from the kitchen.

1358
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:45,349
"What?" he shouted.

1359
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:46,440
"Nothing."

1360
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,679
"No, go on," he shouted. "What did you say?"

1361
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:57,369
"Nothing. Go back to your show. It sounds
fascinating," she said. Eddie got up and went

1362
01:41:57,369 --> 01:42:00,829
to see her. "What's wrong?"

1363
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:06,019
Lynn ignored him and started putting shopping
away in cupboards and in the fridge.

1364
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:10,320
"What's wrong?" he asked again.

1365
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:16,949
This time she stopped and looked at Eddie.
"Erm, well, let me see. I get up in the morning

1366
01:42:16,949 --> 01:42:22,079
and go to work while you sit and watch telly.
I come in from work, and you're still sitting

1367
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:27,429
and watching telly. I do the shopping, I get
no help. I do the cooking, I get no help.

1368
01:42:27,429 --> 01:42:32,070
I try to talk to you, and I get nothing. You
used to have breakfast with me in the mornings,

1369
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:37,510
and now you don't get up at all! We never
go out. Our friends don't call us. The house

1370
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:41,900
is a mess, and you're here all day making
it messier. You don't clean up, you don't

1371
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:44,660
tidy. You look a mess..."

1372
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,090
"Thanks very much."

1373
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:51,530
"... and I don't hear anything positive from
you about anything. Anything! I'm sick of

1374
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:52,590
it."

1375
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:55,659
There was a pause after she stopped.

1376
01:42:55,659 --> 01:42:57,929
"Bad day then?" he said.

1377
01:42:57,929 --> 01:43:04,760
"It's not funny, Eddie. I worry so much about
you, your job situation, money - and then

1378
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,610
I go into work and I have at least twenty
- five kids in my class all day. I try to

1379
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:15,340
keep them under control and happy, but I just
want to cry. I want to tell them all to shut

1380
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:20,920
up. I want to tell them to enjoy drawing pictures
and singing songs, because after that life

1381
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,150
is pointless."

1382
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:25,400
"So, you did have a bad day."

1383
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,440
"Bad year, Eddie. Bad year."

1384
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,479
"So it's all my fault?"

1385
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:33,829
"That is not what I mean."

1386
01:43:33,829 --> 01:43:34,829
"Yeah, right."

1387
01:43:34,829 --> 01:43:42,229
At that point, Lynn picked up a full box of
eggs and threw it at Eddie. He ducked just

1388
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:45,800
in time, and the whole thing exploded on the
kitchen wall.

1389
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:51,840
"I guess we can have omelets for dinner,"
said Eddie, but he knew things had gone too

1390
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:52,840
far.

1391
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,730
"You can have omelets for dinner. I'm going
out."

1392
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:57,889
"Where to?"

1393
01:43:57,889 --> 01:44:00,599
"I'm going to Angela's."

1394
01:44:00,599 --> 01:44:04,650
"Angela's? That's two hours away. When will
you be back?"

1395
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:05,659
"Saturday."

1396
01:44:05,659 --> 01:44:06,670
"Saturday?"

1397
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:10,600
"Maybe Sunday. I don't know."

1398
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,080
"Lynn, please."

1399
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:19,599
"No, Eddie. I've had enough. We're broke - worse
than broke - we are in so much debt. You've

1400
01:44:19,599 --> 01:44:23,780
got no job and you can't get a job, or you
don't want one. I don't know."

1401
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,090
"Lynn, listen to me."

1402
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:28,519
"You sit in the house all day, feeling sorry
for yourself..."

1403
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:29,519
"Lynn..."

1404
01:44:29,519 --> 01:44:30,900
She was crying now.

1405
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:36,421
"... and it isn't getting better," she sobbed.
"It's getting worse and I hate it. I'm sorry

1406
01:44:36,421 --> 01:44:42,350
you lost your job, and I'm sorry it made you
ill. I'm sorry I'm not strong enough now,

1407
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:50,929
but I can't help you anymore. I tried. I've
lost you. You're here, but you're not here.

1408
01:44:50,929 --> 01:44:54,920
I want a break. We want a break."

1409
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,349
"No, Lynn. Please, we have to talk..."

1410
01:44:58,349 --> 01:45:01,369
"I'll call you when I get to Angela's."

1411
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:05,710
She was walking out of the kitchen and into
the hall. She opened the door under the stairs

1412
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:10,729
and took out an overnight bag. Eddie could
see she had already packed it.

1413
01:45:10,729 --> 01:45:14,340
"I don't believe this. You're leaving me?"

1414
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:19,539
"No. I'll be back on Sunday. Maybe. I don't
know."

1415
01:45:19,539 --> 01:45:26,900
"This is ridiculous. You can't go. Lynn, we've
been together for ten years."

1416
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,400
She was putting on her coat.

1417
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,039
"What about your job?"

1418
01:45:30,039 --> 01:45:36,449
"I don't care about the job. You don't care
about work. Now I don't care about work."

1419
01:45:36,449 --> 01:45:40,800
She was walking down the hall towards the
front door. Eddie grabbed her arm.

1420
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,510
"Get your hands off me."

1421
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,510
"Lynn."

1422
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:45,570
"Get your hands off me!"

1423
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:47,989
He let go.

1424
01:45:47,989 --> 01:45:50,409
"Lynn, I'm sorry."

1425
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:55,940
But she had walked out of the door and got
into her car, and was driving down the road.

1426
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:01,459
Eddie stood in the doorway and watched the
car disappear. The rain had stopped, but the

1427
01:46:01,459 --> 01:46:08,300
clouds were ready for another storm. He went
back inside and the house felt very strange.

1428
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:14,170
Panic was in his mind, heart and stomach.
The kitchen door was open, and he saw broken

1429
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:17,639
eggs dripping off the clock and down the wall.

1430
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,330
He sat down on the sofa. The neighbours were
still arguing about the dog, which was now

1431
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:28,179
in the studio, and a dog psychologist was
trying to talk to it. This time last year

1432
01:46:28,179 --> 01:46:33,360
he was in Moscow working on the project of
his career with good money in the bank, and

1433
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:39,000
he and Lynn had even discussed starting a
family. Now, he had lost his job, his money,

1434
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:45,030
his health, his confidence, and even his wife.
Instead of taking the company to the next

1435
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:52,290
level and building a future, he was sitting
in his lounge watching a dog in therapy.

1436
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:57,190
He looked around for the remote control to
change channels, and saw the post. There were

1437
01:46:57,190 --> 01:47:01,920
some letters for Lynn, the new programme for
the theatre, more bills, and a letter from

1438
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:08,630
Steve Scott, his solicitor. He knew what the
letter said before he opened it. It was the

1439
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:13,750
result of many difficult meetings with his
solicitor and financial adviser. The letter

1440
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:16,750
now confirmed that he was bankrupt.

1441
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:18,059
Bankrupt.

1442
01:47:18,059 --> 01:47:20,679
A death.

1443
01:47:20,679 --> 01:47:24,059
The end of a life with money.

1444
01:47:24,059 --> 01:47:30,639
For a few more minutes Eddie watched two American
adults fighting and a dog being hypnotized.

1445
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:35,030
Then he put the letter back in its envelope
and went into the kitchen to clean the eggs

1446
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:37,350
off his kitchen wall.

1447
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:39,199
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The search

1448
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:46,070
The next morning Eddie and Lynn walked into
the dining room and saw Jen having breakfast

1449
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:52,070
with some members of the band. Two men in
uniform were also sitting at the table. They

1450
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:57,300
were asking questions and taking notes. Eddie
assumed it was a discussion about the coming

1451
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:03,280
evening's performance. He was relieved to
see that Dominic was nowhere to be seen. He

1452
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:06,690
still didn't feel ready for the inevitable
second confrontation.

1453
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:13,350
"She looks upset," said Lynn as they sat eating
their breakfast at a table nearby.

1454
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:17,369
"Maybe Dominic went back last night and started
another fight."

1455
01:48:17,369 --> 01:48:19,550
"Where is he then?"

1456
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:21,800
"Maybe she strangled him?"

1457
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,849
"Eddie!"

1458
01:48:22,849 --> 01:48:29,159
"Sorry. He's having a lie-in, I suppose. Who
knows? Who cares?"

1459
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:34,159
At this point Jen looked across and saw Eddie
and Lynn. She pointed at them and got up to

1460
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:37,860
come over. The two men in uniform accompanied
her.

1461
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:41,749
"Hello, Jen," said Lynn. "Is something wrong?"

1462
01:48:41,749 --> 01:48:48,520
"It's Dominic. He's missing. He never came
back last night. Have you seen him?"

1463
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:51,909
Eddie went cold. Lynn looked at him.

1464
01:48:51,909 --> 01:48:57,969
"Not this morning, no," said Eddie. Lynn shook
her head to say the same thing.

1465
01:48:57,969 --> 01:49:02,099
"Did you see him last night at all?" said
one of the men.

1466
01:49:02,099 --> 01:49:08,840
"Yes, I did," said Eddie. "I went out for
some fresh air, and Dominic was outside. We

1467
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:15,489
chatted for a bit and then I came in. Dominic
stayed outside. I didn't see him after that."

1468
01:49:15,489 --> 01:49:19,840
Eddie could honestly say that this was the
truth. He decided not to mention the part

1469
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,690
about trying to kill each other.

1470
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:25,360
"When was this?" asked the other man.

1471
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:28,920
"Oh, about midnight, I think. Or just after."

1472
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,830
"What did you talk about?"

1473
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:37,880
"Not much really. The cruise, the weather,
the food - that kind of thing." Eddie decided

1474
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:43,099
he needed to tell them more. Just in case
people became suspicious. Get his story out

1475
01:49:43,099 --> 01:49:47,269
first. "I remembered him from a long time
ago, though," he said.

1476
01:49:47,269 --> 01:49:52,300
"What do you mean?" asked the second man,
looking up from his notes.

1477
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:58,060
"Mr Stephens used to work at the same company
as me years ago - at Fenton's - a software

1478
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:04,239
manufacturer in the UK. He was the divisional
boss for a while. I was in sales. When Lynn

1479
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:09,510
and I first saw him yesterday, we weren't
sure if it was him or not. I wasn't feeling

1480
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:13,030
well anyway, so we thought we'd meet him later
and find out then."

1481
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:17,010
"And was it him? You knew him from work?"

1482
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:18,010
"Yes."

1483
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:21,599
"And did you talk to him about it when you
saw him later?"

1484
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:27,420
"He didn't really remember me, and it was
almost twenty years ago. I don't blame him.

1485
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:31,439
Anyway, we're both here to get away from work,
so I guess that's why we didn't really talk

1486
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:34,860
about it. I wasn't outside with him for that
long."

1487
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:39,400
"Did he seem upset or stressed in any way?"

1488
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:44,760
Eddie suddenly recalled Dominic's face again.
He had looked very upset and considerably

1489
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:49,519
stressed when Eddie had his hands around his
neck. "Not particularly."

1490
01:50:49,519 --> 01:50:54,159
"What about you, ma'am?" asked the first man.

1491
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:58,949
"I only met him on the cruise for the first
time yesterday. Jen introduced us when we

1492
01:50:58,949 --> 01:51:01,969
all met by chance at the hotel around lunchtime
yesterday."

1493
01:51:01,969 --> 01:51:05,150
"And how did he seem to you?"

1494
01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:10,710
"Normal, I suppose. Eddie wasn't feeling well,
so we came back. I didn't see him after that."

1495
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:18,030
The Parvina returned to Barbados, where the
cruise was delayed and an official search

1496
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:23,539
began. Eddie saw helicopters come and go,
and he saw police coming and going at the

1497
01:51:23,539 --> 01:51:26,750
harbour. There was even a TV crew.

1498
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:31,579
The atmosphere on board had not changed very
much. The ship was so big and there were so

1499
01:51:31,579 --> 01:51:36,170
many people, with so many things going on,
that Dominic's disappearance seemed only a

1500
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:41,739
minor problem. It was almost like an additional
activity for the passengers to talk about.

1501
01:51:41,739 --> 01:51:48,100
Who was the man? When did he disappear? Why?
What happened? Was he injured on the ship

1502
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,639
somewhere? Did he fall overboard?

1503
01:51:51,639 --> 01:51:56,010
Eddie and Lynn walked into town to get away
from things. They walked for hours around

1504
01:51:56,010 --> 01:52:00,659
the streets and marinas. Here and there they
stopped and looked at their map, and read

1505
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:06,979
their guidebook about the history of Bridgetown.
They tried not to talk about Dominic, or even

1506
01:52:06,979 --> 01:52:11,909
to think about it. But Eddie could see that
Lynn was worried, and Lynn could see the same

1507
01:52:11,909 --> 01:52:18,559
in Eddie. Sooner or later they had to talk
again. So they had lunch in a cafe overlooking

1508
01:52:18,559 --> 01:52:22,159
a small bay, and Lynn was the first to speak.

1509
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:24,699
"What do you think has happened, Ed?"

1510
01:52:24,699 --> 01:52:31,559
"I've no idea. I left him standing by the
rail. He was OK. After the fight, he was obviously

1511
01:52:31,559 --> 01:52:37,630
tired and so was I. To be honest, I think
we were both a bit shocked and embarrassed

1512
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:44,010
- and bruised. But he was all right when I
left him. Actually, I thought he would come

1513
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:49,400
after me. I was in the toilet for about ten
minutes. Then I came back in to find you."

1514
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:52,780
"Do you think he fell overboard?" she asked.

1515
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:58,039
"Not from where we were. There was another
deck below, and the rail was too high. To

1516
01:52:58,039 --> 01:52:59,869
go overboard he'd need to jump."

1517
01:52:59,869 --> 01:53:02,520
"So, do you think he jumped?"

1518
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:07,380
"The man thinks he's better than anyone else.
Why would he do that?"

1519
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:12,260
"Who knows? Sixteen years is a long time.
People change."

1520
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:19,679
"Yeah, well, people like him don't change.
Unfortunately."

1521
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,570
When they returned to the ship, the police
asked him to go to the office in Bridgetown

1522
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:28,479
to give an official statement. Jen had made
her statement and given all the information

1523
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:33,579
she could. When she mentioned meeting Lynn
and Eddie, it did not take them long to follow

1524
01:53:33,579 --> 01:53:34,999
it up.

1525
01:53:34,999 --> 01:53:41,280
"And you met at the hotel, is that right?"
asked a tall policeman sitting at his PC.

1526
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:42,280
"Yes."

1527
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,739
"Were you friends?"

1528
01:53:44,739 --> 01:53:50,380
"No, but I worked with him many years ago.
We never stayed in touch. We were only colleagues,

1529
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:54,800
and I never knew much about him or his life.
I couldn't believe it when I saw him again

1530
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,289
after so long. He didn't even recognise me."

1531
01:53:58,289 --> 01:54:01,510
"So did you meet later, back on the boat?"

1532
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:09,360
"Not together, no. As I said, his girlfriend
met my wife by chance. We met briefly at lunch,

1533
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:13,959
and we agreed to meet later for a drink."
Eddie didn't mean to say that, but then he

1534
01:54:13,959 --> 01:54:17,949
realized Jen had probably said that in her
statement.

1535
01:54:17,949 --> 01:54:23,880
Eddie waited for another question. The policeman
looked up at him. "How did he seem when you

1536
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:27,380
met him at the hotel? Happy? Sad?"

1537
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:33,351
"It was hard to tell," said Eddie. That was
true. "He had his sunglasses on the whole

1538
01:54:33,351 --> 01:54:36,239
time. We only chatted for a few minutes."

1539
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:38,500
"And did you meet for a drink?"

1540
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:43,599
"No, we didn't. We were supposed to meet at
the bar after Jen, his girlfriend, finished

1541
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:47,239
her session with the band. I met him briefly
on deck though."

1542
01:54:47,239 --> 01:54:54,389
"I see," said the policeman, tapping information
on his keyboard. "What did you talk about?"

1543
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:59,959
"Not much really. I was only with him for
about five minutes, but I came inside because

1544
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:05,829
I was cold." Then Eddie thought he should
add something else. "I was hoping to find

1545
01:55:05,829 --> 01:55:10,420
out what he'd been up to since the old days,
but I never saw him after that."

1546
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,900
"Why not?"

1547
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:16,729
"I'm not sure, to be honest. I was with my
wife for the evening, but we went back to

1548
01:55:16,729 --> 01:55:22,460
our cabin earlier than we had planned. We
were tired. I was feeling unwell. I was unwell

1549
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:25,360
at the hotel. Too much sun, I think."

1550
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:31,650
"Ah yes, Mr Stephens' girlfriend mentioned
that. What time did you go to your cabin?"

1551
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:38,159
"I have no idea." Eddie didn't like to end
his statement with uncertainty, so he added:

1552
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:43,729
"On the ship you lose track of time. We both
went to sleep. The first thing we heard about

1553
01:55:43,729 --> 01:55:49,199
Dominic's disappearance was this morning when
Jen came to tell us at breakfast."

1554
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:52,870
The policeman nodded and carried on typing.

1555
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:58,340
"So what do you think has happened?" Eddie
asked the policeman. "We're not allowed to

1556
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:04,039
say, Mr Munro. A thorough search of the ship
and the area is being carried out. If we hear

1557
01:56:04,039 --> 01:56:06,219
anything, there will be an announcement."

1558
01:56:06,219 --> 01:56:09,829
"Is that all then?" asked Eddie.

1559
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:15,550
"Yes, thank you, that's all for now. We have
your details if we have any more questions."

1560
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:23,730
"OK," said Eddie. He got up and walked out
of the office into the bright Caribbean sunshine.

1561
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:29,019
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Swimming not sinking

1562
01:56:29,019 --> 01:56:34,280
In the end, Lynn stayed with Angela for five
months. She told Eddie that she needed some

1563
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:39,829
time to feel normal again. They didn't argue
anymore and it was only a separation, but

1564
01:56:39,829 --> 01:56:45,709
it frightened Eddie. When Lynn left and stayed
away for five months instead of three nights,

1565
01:56:45,709 --> 01:56:51,300
he really thought he'd lost her forever. He
was as low, lost and lonely as anyone can

1566
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:57,290
feel, but he knew this was a turning point.
Losing Lynn was a thousand times worse than

1567
01:56:57,290 --> 01:57:04,070
losing his job, and he needed to make changes.
As Clive said to him during that time: "When

1568
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:06,309
you hit rock bottom, the only way is up."

1569
01:57:06,309 --> 01:57:13,329
It was a mess, however. Eddie's mental health
was not good, and it got much worse when Lynn

1570
01:57:13,329 --> 01:57:21,070
left. He couldn't find work, and his depression
made it impossible to do so. Lynn also lost

1571
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:26,070
her job when she didn't come back immediately.
They had to sell the house and furniture to

1572
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:32,199
cover all their debts, and they were no longer
in a position to borrow money to start again.

1573
01:57:32,199 --> 01:57:37,489
Steve Scott, their solicitor, was an enormous
help to both of them, handling their finances

1574
01:57:37,489 --> 01:57:43,289
and their legal problems. He did everything
except start a divorce action for them, and

1575
01:57:43,289 --> 01:57:49,550
they had Clive to thank for that. Clive realized
that the separation could not last long, and

1576
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:55,400
he kept in touch with both of them to make
sure that it didn't result in total breakdown.

1577
01:57:55,400 --> 01:58:00,659
By Christmas that year Eddie was staying at
Clive's and Lynn was I still at Angela's.

1578
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:04,260
On New Year's Day Eddie called Lynn to give
her his best wishes.

1579
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:07,050
"Happy New Year," he said.

1580
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:10,040
"Same to you. All the best," she said.

1581
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:13,219
"I hope it's better than the last one," he
said.

1582
01:58:13,219 --> 01:58:17,929
"That won't be difficult. It couldn't be worse,"
she said.

1583
01:58:17,929 --> 01:58:19,090
Silence.

1584
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:25,250
"It's strange," said Eddie. "We have never
been apart on New Year's Eve."

1585
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:26,999
"No," said Lynn.

1586
01:58:26,999 --> 01:58:28,889
"What did you do?"

1587
01:58:28,889 --> 01:58:35,079
"Well, you know me. I don't like it much.
Angela and I stayed in on our own and watched

1588
01:58:35,079 --> 01:58:40,249
DVDs. Then some neighbours came around just
before midnight. We got to bed around two

1589
01:58:40,249 --> 01:58:41,249
o'clock."

1590
01:58:41,249 --> 01:58:42,329
"Sounds good."

1591
01:58:42,329 --> 01:58:43,969
"Not really."

1592
01:58:43,969 --> 01:58:44,969
"Why?"

1593
01:58:44,969 --> 01:58:48,639
"Well, you know..." she said.

1594
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:51,760
Eddie knew. "Yes," he said.

1595
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:54,099
"You?" asked Lynn.

1596
01:58:54,099 --> 01:58:55,099
"What?"

1597
01:58:55,099 --> 01:58:56,969
"What did you do?"

1598
01:58:56,969 --> 01:59:02,150
"Oh, Clive and I went to the pub and stayed
there until about one. It was OK."

1599
01:59:02,150 --> 01:59:03,520
"How is Clive?"

1600
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:06,239
"He's here. Do you want to speak to him?"

1601
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,309
"No, it's all right. I'll text him."

1602
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:10,349
"OK."

1603
01:59:10,349 --> 01:59:12,440
A pause.

1604
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:14,719
"Lynn?" said Eddie eventually.

1605
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,610
"I'm still here."

1606
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:19,059
"I miss you."

1607
01:59:19,059 --> 01:59:20,699
"I know."

1608
01:59:20,699 --> 01:59:23,150
"Come back. Please."

1609
01:59:23,150 --> 01:59:24,780
"I can't."

1610
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:25,780
"Why?"

1611
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,699
"Because... you haven't got a house, and neither
have I!"

1612
01:59:28,699 --> 01:59:30,369
They both laughed a little.

1613
01:59:30,369 --> 01:59:32,719
"OK. If I get a house, will you come back?"

1614
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:35,179
"Only if you get a big one."

1615
01:59:35,179 --> 01:59:36,179
"OK."

1616
01:59:36,179 --> 01:59:37,179
"Very big."

1617
01:59:37,179 --> 01:59:38,179
"OK."

1618
01:59:38,179 --> 01:59:39,179
"With a garden."

1619
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:40,179
"Right."

1620
01:59:40,179 --> 01:59:41,179
"A big garden."

1621
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:42,479
"I'l1 try."

1622
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:44,689
"And a swimming pool."

1623
01:59:44,689 --> 01:59:46,340
"Erm, OK."

1624
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:47,340
"Liar."

1625
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:51,199
"OK, the swimming pool will take time. I'll
work on that."

1626
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:56,059
"Fine. A large bathroom and modern kitchen
will be OK instead."

1627
01:59:56,059 --> 01:59:59,860
"With or without egg on the walls?"

1628
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:02,130
He heard her laugh on the other end.

1629
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,289
Another pause.

1630
02:00:03,289 --> 02:00:07,280
"How are you feeling?" she asked. "Generally."

1631
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:12,209
"Not bad. Clive makes me go swimming and read
his car magazines."

1632
02:00:12,209 --> 02:00:14,469
"Good for you."

1633
02:00:14,469 --> 02:00:16,940
"Hmm," muttered Eddie.

1634
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:18,280
Silence.

1635
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:20,739
Eddie wanted to tell Lynn again that he missed
her.

1636
02:00:20,739 --> 02:00:23,010
"Don't give up, Ed," she said.

1637
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:26,670
"I know," he said.

1638
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:32,059
Lynn was Eddie's motivation to rebuild his
life, and Clive was his support. But Eddie

1639
02:00:32,059 --> 02:00:37,480
realized that only he could turn things around.
He was encouraged that over the time he was

1640
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:43,340
out of work, he had actually started missing
his work and his friends in the business.

1641
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:48,519
Over the next few years, Eddie put together
a business plan and borrowed money from friends

1642
02:00:48,519 --> 02:00:50,030
and family.

1643
02:00:50,030 --> 02:00:56,519
He began as an export agent in London for
various UK software companies. He still had

1644
02:00:56,519 --> 02:01:01,479
a strong and loyal commercial network throughout
Europe, and many of his old customers and

1645
02:01:01,479 --> 02:01:06,380
contacts were glad to have him back. Some
had already become disillusioned with the

1646
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:11,619
larger companies like Fenton's, and Eddie's
introduction of new products and a faster

1647
02:01:11,619 --> 02:01:18,531
and more personal service brought good results.
His enthusiasm and energy returned, and every

1648
02:01:18,531 --> 02:01:23,749
day he enjoyed the thought that he was his
own boss; no one could undermine his plans

1649
02:01:23,749 --> 02:01:26,369
or take away the credit.

1650
02:01:26,369 --> 02:01:31,309
He set up a small office not far from Notting
Hill and started off with a part-time office

1651
02:01:31,309 --> 02:01:37,659
assistant. At the end of the first year he
had taken on three full-time people. By the

1652
02:01:37,659 --> 02:01:43,329
following year he had moved to larger offices
and had a team of ten. It was the beginning

1653
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:48,590
of a sixteen-year journey which turned Eddie
from a bankrupt, broken individual into a

1654
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:52,519
confident and very wealthy man.

1655
02:01:52,519 --> 02:01:57,760
Over time Eddie poached some of the team from
Fentons, including Clive, who soon joined

1656
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:03,860
him as a partner. Clive then head hunted some
of the best people from Fenton's production

1657
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:10,010
and development team. With investment from
some overseas partners, they then created

1658
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:15,499
a series of online titles for companies to
provide general training, systems and platforms

1659
02:02:15,499 --> 02:02:17,820
to run their businesses.

1660
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:22,889
This was a turning point. Clive and Eddie's
team developed a unique way of linking online

1661
02:02:22,889 --> 02:02:28,260
training with mobile phone technology, and
their best-seller was a twelve-module course

1662
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:34,989
called People Skills for Successful Business.
They licensed it worldwide and won an innovation

1663
02:02:34,989 --> 02:02:40,739
award. At the awards night at the Savoy Hotel
in London, Clive suggested they send a copy

1664
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:46,070
of the whole series to Dominic and Neal, but
Eddie said it was a waste. "They wouldn't

1665
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:51,960
understand," he said. "Some people think they
know everything anyway. Let them suffer."

1666
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:55,139
And they toasted their success.

1667
02:02:55,139 --> 02:02:59,719
Business went from strength to strength, and
Eddie travelled extensively to build strategic

1668
02:02:59,719 --> 02:03:05,650
partnerships using the training catalogue
of integrated online-mobile training (OMT).

1669
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:11,960
His contacts and friends in business were
loyal and supportive. Within five years they

1670
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:19,770
had offices in Hong Kong, San Francisco, New
York, Sydney, Bucharest, Munich and Paris.

1671
02:03:19,770 --> 02:03:24,539
On the day when he and Clive sold the business
for 20 million pounds, Eddie came home to

1672
02:03:24,539 --> 02:03:27,099
Lynn, who was sitting in the garden reading.

1673
02:03:27,099 --> 02:03:31,190
"It's done," he said, smiling.

1674
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:32,309
"Really?"

1675
02:03:32,309 --> 02:03:37,429
"Really. We signed the agreement this afternoon.
It's over."

1676
02:03:37,429 --> 02:03:40,530
"Twenty million?" she asked.

1677
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:42,699
"Twenty million."

1678
02:03:42,699 --> 02:03:49,800
"Oh, Eddie!" She jumped up and put her arms
around him. "I am so pleased for you. For

1679
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:52,159
us. You deserve it."

1680
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:54,519
"Thanks. Let's open the champagne."

1681
02:03:54,519 --> 02:03:57,820
"It's in the fridge. I'll go and get it,"
she said.

1682
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:01,469
When she came back, Eddie handed her a large
envelope.

1683
02:04:01,469 --> 02:04:03,639
"What's this?" she asked excitedly.

1684
02:04:03,639 --> 02:04:04,639
"Open it."

1685
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:11,239
Lynn tore open the envelope and pulled out
a large, colourful holiday brochure. "What's

1686
02:04:11,239 --> 02:04:13,249
this?" she asked.

1687
02:04:13,249 --> 02:04:14,909
"It's a holiday brochure."

1688
02:04:14,909 --> 02:04:20,420
"I know it's a holiday brochure," she said,
smiling. "Where are we going?"

1689
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:23,110
"We're going on a cruise."

1690
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:25,280
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Revelations

1691
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:33,969
Two more days passed with no sign of Dominic.
Then three days, then four, then five. Soon

1692
02:04:33,969 --> 02:04:39,999
a whole week had passed. Eventually the authorities
decided to call off the search, and let the

1693
02:04:39,999 --> 02:04:45,369
ship continue on its voyage. The shipping
line did not want to cause any further inconvenience

1694
02:04:45,369 --> 02:04:50,389
for the passengers. The longer they stayed
there, the more bad publicity they faced from

1695
02:04:50,389 --> 02:04:57,800
the press. From their point of view the sooner
things got back to normal, the better. Cruise

1696
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:04,309
life continued and the Parvina took Eddie
and Lynn, and its mystery, to St Lucia, Antigua,

1697
02:05:04,309 --> 02:05:06,369
Martinique and Grenada.

1698
02:05:06,369 --> 02:05:13,590
Back in Barbados, before flying home, Eddie
and Lynn went shopping and stopped at a cafe.

1699
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:19,539
The TV was on by the bar, but the sound was
off. Eddie stared at the news and saw some

1700
02:05:19,539 --> 02:05:24,900
familiar pictures of the ship, the helicopter
searches, and the same photograph of Dominic

1701
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:31,099
that was used in all the reports of his disappearance.
They had seen all these pictures before, but

1702
02:05:31,099 --> 02:05:37,829
this time the report seemed to continue with
interviews with people back in the UK.

1703
02:05:37,829 --> 02:05:42,829
Eddie could see a businessman talking to a
TV journalist. Then another. Then there were

1704
02:05:42,829 --> 02:05:48,119
pictures of some buildings. They were offices
where Dominic had worked, but Eddie didn't

1705
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:53,599
recognise them. There were pictures of Dominic's
house, and an interview with an elderly couple.

1706
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:58,729
The caption read that they were Dominic's
neighbours. There was no time to get up and

1707
02:05:58,729 --> 02:06:03,389
see if he could turn on the sound before the
news moved on to another topic.

1708
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:08,789
"Lynn, they've just shown the report on Dominic
again. But they're showing more stuff from

1709
02:06:08,789 --> 02:06:12,510
home and about where he worked - and interviews
with his neighbours!"

1710
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:17,110
"Well, everyone loves a good mystery, I suppose,"
she said.

1711
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:21,350
"No, I think the story's changed. Something's
going on."

1712
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:24,979
"Well, maybe you should get a newspaper or
look on the internet."

1713
02:06:24,979 --> 02:06:31,650
"Good idea," said Eddie, looking around. There
were no papers, but there were two computer

1714
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:38,010
screens in the corner. Eddie bought a username
and password from the waiter and went online.

1715
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:43,989
He keyed in the address for The Times' website,
and there he saw a headline below the UK political

1716
02:06:43,989 --> 02:06:50,669
news that took him completely by surprise.
Under a familiar photograph of Dominic, it

1717
02:06:50,669 --> 02:06:51,669
read:

1718
02:06:51,669 --> 02:06:56,579
Missing businessman stole thousands. Police
suspect suicide.

1719
02:06:56,579 --> 02:07:00,699
Eddie couldn't believe it. He clicked on the
headline and a new page revealed itself on

1720
02:07:00,699 --> 02:07:05,301
the screen. Underneath the headline there
was a picture of a younger Dominic, and a

1721
02:07:05,301 --> 02:07:10,070
new article appeared. Eddie could not read
it fast enough:

1722
02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:15,880
The search for missing London businessman
Dominic Stephens has finally been called off.

1723
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:21,729
Authorities now believe that Mr Stephens took
his own life whilst on a cruise in the Caribbean,

1724
02:07:21,729 --> 02:07:26,179
leaving behind large debts and a trail of
fraud and corruption.

1725
02:07:26,179 --> 02:07:31,369
Mr Stephens went missing over a week ago on
the American cruise ship Parvina some time

1726
02:07:31,369 --> 02:07:38,479
after midnight on 20 June in the south Caribbean
sea. After days of searching, it is now believed

1727
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:43,619
that Mr Stephens may have jumped overboard
somewhere between Barbados and St Lucia in

1728
02:07:43,619 --> 02:07:50,209
an act of suicide. The exact time of his disappearance
is not known. Search and rescue teams have

1729
02:07:50,209 --> 02:07:55,510
been covering an area of thousands of square
miles with no sign of Mr Stephens.

1730
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:59,880
The disappearance follows reports that Mr
Stephens had recently been fired from Flash

1731
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:05,829
Electronics Inc. by partners in the firm.
It had been discovered that Mr Stephens had

1732
02:08:05,829 --> 02:08:11,699
embezzled at least 145,000 pounds from the
company during the seven years he had worked

1733
02:08:11,699 --> 02:08:17,519
there as CEO. Further interviews with police
are also being held at other companies, who

1734
02:08:17,519 --> 02:08:23,809
have also reported acts of fraud, corruption
and intimidation in connection with Mr Stephens.

1735
02:08:23,809 --> 02:08:29,310
The sixty-one-year-old businessman was due
to appear in court on 15 June, charged with

1736
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:34,809
theft, but failed to make an appearance. He
was reported missing by his wife, Margaret

1737
02:08:34,809 --> 02:08:40,250
Stephens, but it is believed Mr Stephens left
the country on 16 June to join the cruise

1738
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:46,590
ship Parvina. Friends and colleagues spoke
of their shock and disappointment...

1739
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:52,420
Eddie looked up from the screen and turned
around to Lynn who was sipping an iced tea.

1740
02:08:52,420 --> 02:09:00,059
"Lynn, you're not going to believe this,"
he said.

1741
02:09:00,059 --> 02:09:04,499
On the last night of the cruise Eddie and
Lynn had a quiet dinner together in the Starlight

1742
02:09:04,499 --> 02:09:10,949
Lounge, danced for a while, and then went
for a walk on deck before bed.

1743
02:09:10,949 --> 02:09:16,360
Although the day's intense humidity had gone,
the evening was still warm. The sky was clear,

1744
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:22,479
and bright stars mixed once more with island
lights on the far horizon. Eddie leaned on

1745
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:24,139
the rail and looked out.

1746
02:09:24,139 --> 02:09:26,739
"I'm going to miss all this," he said.

1747
02:09:26,739 --> 02:09:31,689
"I know. Me too. But we can do it again, can't
we?"

1748
02:09:31,689 --> 02:09:33,030
"Yes. Definitely."

1749
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:38,959
"But maybe next time we can do it without
your ex-boss turning up and creating an international

1750
02:09:38,959 --> 02:09:40,840
incident."

1751
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:48,020
Eddie smiled. "Well, if he does turn up next
time, he'll have a lot of explaining to do."

1752
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:52,439
"Unbelievable. It's like a story from a film
or a book."

1753
02:09:52,439 --> 02:09:54,820
"Yes. Truth is often stranger than fiction."

1754
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:59,409
A pause. Both of them looked out to sea.

1755
02:09:59,409 --> 02:10:03,040
"Do you really think he's out there?" asked
Lynn.

1756
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:07,119
"He must be. He's not on the ship, that's
for sure."

1757
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:14,230
"It's a scary thought. He must have been so
desperate, to jump off a ship at sea. If he

1758
02:10:14,230 --> 02:10:17,239
did jump. Can you imagine?" said Lynn.

1759
02:10:17,239 --> 02:10:18,959
"Maybe he fell."

1760
02:10:18,959 --> 02:10:25,590
"Maybe you pushed him," she said, smiling
and nudging Eddie in the side with her elbow.

1761
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:30,729
It still hurt where Dominic had punched him.
The man was still a pain in his side.

1762
02:10:30,729 --> 02:10:35,829
"Maybe someone else pushed him?" suggested
Eddie. "Back home there was probably a long

1763
02:10:35,829 --> 02:10:40,889
queue of people waiting to do something like
that to him, and to all the superior-minded,

1764
02:10:40,889 --> 02:10:43,850
arrogant Dominic's of the world."

1765
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:45,789
"Sad," she said.

1766
02:10:45,789 --> 02:10:51,651
"Very," said Eddie. "Some are pushed and some
jump anyway. That's the way it is. That's

1767
02:10:51,651 --> 02:10:57,459
the way it's always been. The trick is what
you do next."

1768
02:10:57,459 --> 02:11:03,880
Eddie took a deep, relaxed breath, let out
a long sigh and looked out to sea to the Caribbean

1769
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:07,659
horizon once more and for the last time.

1770
02:11:07,659 --> 02:11:09,610
And then he smiled.

1771
02:11:09,610 --> 02:11:12,610
It was very clear to him now.

1772
02:11:12,610 --> 02:11:17,639
He could easily make out the difference between
the stars and the lights of the island, and

1773
02:11:17,639 --> 02:11:20,570
he wondered why he had never noticed it before.
