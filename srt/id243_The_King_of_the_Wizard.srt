CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,209
The Juggler

3
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:14,940
A long time ago, a man called Hamish lived
in a town by the sea in Scotland.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,650
He and his wife, Catriona, lived happily in
a small white house.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,110
Hamish was a fisherman and he went out to
sea in his boat every day.

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:38,000
He usually caught a lot of fish and Catriona
sold them at the fish market.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,880
One day Hamish was out at sea.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,390
It was late in the afternoon and it was time
to go home.

9
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,969
He started pulling his net out of the water.

10
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,730
'The net is very heavy today,' he thought
happily.

11
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,550
'Lots of fish...'

12
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,260
When he pulled the net onto his boat, he saw
a wooden box.

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,860
He was very surprised.

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,299
He opened the wooden box and found a little
baby boy inside!

15
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,310
'Oh, a baby boy!' he cried.

16
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,220
'This is wonderful!

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,470
We don't have any children and Catriona will
be very happy!

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,500
She loves babies.'

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,950
He went back home and showed Catriona the
baby boy.

20
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:40,329
'Oh, Hamish, what good luck!' said Catriona
happily.

21
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,909
'What a good-looking baby!

22
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,570
We must keep this child and look after him.

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,840
Let's call him Calum.'

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
'Yes,' said Hamish, 'I like the name Calum.

25
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,219
He's our son now.

26
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:03,210
We'll look after him and give him all our
love and teach him to fish!'

27
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,110
Calum grew up and was a kind, friendly boy.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,879
He loved Hamish and Catriona and they loved
him a lot, too.

29
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,780
Hamish taught him to fish and he learnt quickly.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,690
They went out in the boat together every day
but not on Sundays.

31
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:34,690
On Sundays, Hamish worked in the garden and
Calum went to the port to look at the sailing

32
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,190
ships.

33
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:43,870
When Calum was seventeen, a big sailing ship
arrived in the port of the town.

34
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,010
It was a beautiful sailing ship.

35
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,970
The sails were new and white, and the masts
were golden.

36
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,870
A tall, good-looking man stood on the deck.

37
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:07,950
He had dark hair and dark eyes, and he was
wearing a beautiful black suit.

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,580
He had balls with spikes in his hands.

39
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,950
He was juggling the balls very fast, without
hurting his hands on the spikes.

40
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,590
Calum watched the juggler with great interest.

41
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,799
Then the juggler got off the ship and continued
juggling the balls in the air.

42
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,590
'Do you like juggling, Calum?' asked the juggler.

43
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,950
Calum was surprised that the juggler knew
his name.

44
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,160
'Oh, yes!'

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Calum said.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,590
It's wonderful!'

47
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,659
'Do you want to become a juggler too?'

48
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,760
'Yes, I do!' said Calum, smiling at the juggler.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,090
'I want to learn how to juggle those balls.

50
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,950
It must be difficult.'

51
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,060
'Very well,' said the juggler, 'take me to
your parents.

52
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,940
I want to talk to them.'

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,890
Calum took the juggler to his little house
by the sea.

54
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:21,070
'Father, mother,' said Calum, 'this man wants
to talk to you.'

55
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,380
Hamish and Catriona were happy to meet the
juggler.

56
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,340
'We love Calum dearly,' said Hamish.

57
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,290
'I found him at sea when he was a baby.'

58
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,030
'At sea?' asked the juggler.

59
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,590
He was suddenly very interested in Calum.

60
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:49,370
'If Hamish found him at sea, then Calum is
a fairy child - a magical child,' thought

61
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,720
the juggler.

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:59,880
'Give me your son for a year and a day,' said
the clever wizard, 'and I will teach him how

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,840
to juggle.

64
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,880
Then when he comes back home he can be a juggler.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,400
Jugglers make more money than fishermen.'

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,720
Hamish and Catriona looked at each other.

67
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,890
They did not know what to do.

68
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:27,190
'We must do what is best for our son,' said
Catriona, looking at Calum.

69
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,940
'Do you want to be a juggler, a good juggler,
Calum?' asked Hamish.

70
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,000
'Yes, father, I do,' said Calum.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,310
'Very well,' said Hamish, 'You can go away
for a year and a day.

72
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,819
And when you come back you will be a good
juggler.

73
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,180
Is that right, sir?'

74
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,060
He looked at the juggler's dark eyes.

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,070
'That's right, Hamish,' said the wizard.

76
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,910
'Your son will become a great juggler and
he'll make a lot of money.

77
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,080
I'll teach him a lot of things.'

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,259
Calum said good-bye to his parents and left
his home with the juggler.

79
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:25,340
For a year and a day, Calum sailed everywhere
on the beautiful sailing ship.

80
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,150
He saw a lot of new and interesting places.

81
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,750
And he learned all about juggling.

82
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,569
CHAPTER TWO

83
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,880
The Fourteen Pigeons

84
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,009
After a year and a day, the juggler brought
Calum back to his home in Scotland.

85
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,660
Calum was now an excellent juggler.

86
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:01,560
He could juggle seven spiked balls and he
never hurt his hands with the spikes.

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,259
Hamish and Catriona were very happy when Calum
arrived.

88
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,729
They thanked the juggler.

89
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,190
'Now your son is a good juggler,' said the
man.

90
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:21,120
'If he stays with me for another year and
a day he will become the best juggler in the

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
world.'

92
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,520
'How wonderful!' said Hamish.

93
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,879
'Yes, Calum can go with you again.'

94
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,910
Calum left for another year and a day, but
at the end of that time, he did not return

95
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,540
to his home.

96
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,220
Hamish and Catriona were worried.

97
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,229
They went to the port to look for the beautiful
sailing ship but it was not there.

98
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:57,530
They asked a lot of people but no one knew
anything about Calum or the juggler.

99
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:05,020
'Catriona,' said Hamish sadly, 'I must go
and find Calum.'

100
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:11,030
'Please be careful, Hamish,' said his wife,
'and bring Calum home quickly.'

101
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:19,509
'Don't worry, dear,' said Hamish, kissing
his wife on the cheek.

102
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,840
Poor Hamish did not know where to look for
his son.

103
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,740
He walked through the forests, up the hills
and mountains and crossed a lot of rivers

104
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,030
- but he did not find Calum.

105
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,729
One night Hamish was very tired and hungry.

106
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,959
He saw a little old house in the forest.

107
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,870
There was a light in the window.

108
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,260
'Perhaps the person in this house can help
me,' thought Hamish.

109
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,300
'Hello!' said Hamish.

110
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,200
'Is anyone home?'

111
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,279
A very old, kind wizard opened the door.

112
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,519
He had bright blue eyes and a kind smile.

113
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,220
'Welcome to my home!

114
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,980
Please come in,' said the friendly old man.

115
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,839
'You must be very tired.

116
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,270
Sit down and rest.'

117
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,070
Hamish sat down near the fire.

118
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,459
The old man gave him some hot tea, bread and
butter.

119
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:35,280
Hamish ate the bread and butter, and drank
the hot tea.

120
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:44,590
After eating, he felt better and told the
old man about his long journey.

121
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:50,130
The old man listened carefully and was suddenly
sad.

122
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:58,830
'Your son's in the hands of the evil King
of the Wizards!' he said.

123
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:05,260
'Everyone here knows about the wizard and
his terrible magic.

124
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,930
But don't worry; I'll help you.

125
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,020
You must rest now and we'll talk about it
tomorrow morning.'

126
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:22,890
He gave Hamish a warm red blanket and he fell
asleep near the fire.

127
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,400
Early the next morning the old man gave Hamish
some breakfast.

128
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:34,680
Then he said, 'Today you must go to the King
of the Wizards.

129
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,339
He lives in a dark castle on a high hill.

130
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,329
When you get there, you must talk to the king
immediately.

131
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,150
Tell him you want your son.

132
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,990
The king will take you to his tower where
there are fourteen pigeons.

133
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:03,700
The king has magic powers and can change a
person into a pigeon!

134
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,750
If you recognise your son, you can take him
home with you.'

135
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,610
'But how will I recognise my son?' asked poor
Hamish.

136
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,670
'Pigeons all look the same.'

137
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:28,070
'Remember this: Calum is the pigeon with a
tiny black feather on its head,' said the

138
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,500
old man.

139
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,760
'Look at all the pigeons slowly and carefully.

140
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,889
Then choose that one and you'll have your
son again!'

141
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,490
'You're a good friend,' said Hamish to the
kind old man.

142
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,970
'Thank you for your help.

143
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,139
I'll always remember you.'

144
00:11:54,139 --> 00:12:00,220
'Good luck to you, Hamish!' said the old man.

145
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,970
Hamish followed the old man's instructions.

146
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:12,850
He crossed a dark forest and a big river and
then started walking up a high hill.

147
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,709
The wizard's dark castle was on top of the
hill.

148
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,459
There were a lot of towers all around it.

149
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:28,019
The sky was dark and cloudy, and suddenly
the wind started blowing.

150
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,090
'What an ugly place!'

151
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:36,060
thought Hamish, looking at the castle and
its towers.

152
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,279
'My son is in one of those towers.'

153
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,630
He got to a black wooden door.

154
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,420
He rang a big bell and waited.

155
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,019
After a few minutes, a man opened the door.

156
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:59,210
'I want to see the King of the Wizards,' said
Hamish.

157
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:06,350
In a moment, the juggler in the black suit
was standing at the door of the castle.

158
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:13,600
Hamish was scared when he saw the evil wizard.

159
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,790
CHAPTER THREE

160
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,910
In the Tower

161
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:26,070
The king of Wizards immediately recognised
Hamish, and he was not happy to see him.

162
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,589
'What do you want?'

163
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:30,380
the wizard asked angrily.

164
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,980
'I want my son, Calum,' said Hamish.

165
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,130
'You promised to bring him to us after a year
and a day.'

166
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,880
The wizard was silent for a moment.

167
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:54,350
'I can give you anything you want: beautiful
clothes, a fast horse, a new fishing boat,

168
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:04,750
a big house, a jewel for your wife - but let
me keep your son,' said the wizard.

169
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,769
'All these presents are nothing to me and
my wife,' said Hamish.

170
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,589
'We want our son, Calum!'

171
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,829
'You're foolish!' said the clever wizard.

172
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:23,060
'You can do a lot of things with a new boat
or a fast horse.

173
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,840
And your wife will be happy with a big diamond.'

174
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,029
'I don't want your presents,' said Hamish
angrily.

175
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,070
'I want my son, now!'

176
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,120
'You're very foolish, Hamish,' said the wizard.

177
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,540
'Take all the presents you want but leave
your son here with me!'

178
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,620
'Never!'

179
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,700
cried Hamish.

180
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,180
'I want my son immediately!'

181
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:02,650
The wizard looked at Hamish with his cold,
evil eyes and started laughing.

182
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:11,470
'Follow me to the tower!' he said laughing.

183
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,880
They climbed the steps up to a dark tower.

184
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,199
In the tower, there were fourteen pigeons.

185
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:29,389
'Now Hamish,' said the wizard, 'choose the
right pigeon and you can have your son, Calum.'

186
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:37,560
'This fisherman will never choose the right
pigeon,' thought the wizard, 'and his son

187
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,810
will always be mine!'

188
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,350
Hamish walked around the tower and looked
at all the pigeons carefully.

189
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,940
Then he saw one with a tiny black feather
on its head.

190
00:15:52,940 --> 00:16:00,920
'I'll choose this pigeon with the tiny black
feather on its head,' Hamish said.

191
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,769
Suddenly Calum was standing in front of his
father.

192
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,410
'Father!' said Calum happily.

193
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:14,160
The wizard was very angry and cried, 'Get
out of here!

194
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,199
One day I'll come back!'

195
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,580
Hamish and Calum ran down the dark stairs
and out of the castle.

196
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,030
Then they ran down the hill and into the forest.

197
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,850
They stopped at the old man's house in the
forest and thanked him.

198
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,060
Then they went home.

199
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,760
Catriona was very happy when she saw Hamish
and Calum.

200
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,480
She could not believe her eyes.

201
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,230
'Calum, my dear boy!'

202
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,110
she said.

203
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,750
'I'm very happy to see you.

204
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,880
Thank you for bringing him home, Hamish.'

205
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,069
'Oh, mother,' said Calum, 'I don't want to
go away anymore.

206
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,970
I want to work here, in my town.

207
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,329
Now I'm the best juggler in the world.

208
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:19,010
The King of the Wizards taught me a lot of
magic tricks.

209
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,270
People will come to see me.'

210
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,390
Calum became the town juggler and magician.

211
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,700
The people in town always enjoyed his tricks
and his juggling.

212
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,500
His hands moved very fast and everyone was
surprised.

213
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,240
People from his town and other towns came
to see him.

214
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,230
The children liked Calum a lot.

215
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,250
He became famous and made a lot of money.

216
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,650
Now Calum and Hamish only went fishing for
fun.

217
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:02,870
The beautiful sailing ship with the big white
sails and the golden masts never came to the

218
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,470
port again.

219
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:13,860
But on stormy nights the people of the town
told scary stories about the King of the Wizards,

220
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,800
who lived in the dark castle on the hill...
