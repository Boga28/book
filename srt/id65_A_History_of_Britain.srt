00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:01,389
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:03,870
Invaders

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,500
It was 1066, and Edward, King of England,
was dead.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,380
He had no children.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,809
The most important people in the country met
to choose a new king.

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,830
They chose Harold.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,220
Harold wasn't a blood relative of King Edward,
but he was the Queens brother.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,650
He was a popular man for the job.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,180
But other powerful men wanted to be king too.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,610
One of them was the King of Norway, Harold
Hardrada, and a few months after King Edward's

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,040
death his army invaded the north of England.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,760
King Harold of England went north, defeated
the invaders and killed King Harold of Norway.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,040
But three days later, there was more bad news.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,200
William of Normandy (in the north of France)
was on the south coast of England with an

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,730
army.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,230
'Before King Edward died, he chose me as the
next king,' he said.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,420
Perhaps this was true.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,330
Edward's mother was a Norman, and Edward lived
in Normandy as a child.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,760
He preferred Normans to the people of England.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,260
So Harold raced south with his army.

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,210
William was waiting for him at Hastings.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:25,230
At the end of the battle, Harold was dead
and William of Normandy was William the Conqueror,

23
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,330
King of England.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,250
Roman Britain

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,890
The Normans weren't the first people who invaded
Britain.

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:41,710
In 55 BC the great Roman Julius Caesar brought
an army across the sea from France.

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,520
For four hundred years, England was part of
the Roman Empire.

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,820
When the Romans first arrived, there were
many different groups of people.

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,860
Each group had its own king.

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,570
They didn't think of themselves as 'British',
but the Romans called the people from all

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,740
these groups 'Britons'.

32
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,170
Boudica

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,119
The Romans tried many times to conquer the
areas of Britain that we now call Wales and

34
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,340
Scotland.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,920
But they never kept control there.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,510
In the rest of Britain, the local people were
much easier to control.

37
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,819
But Boudica was different.

38
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,060
Her husband was a local king in the east of
England.

39
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,810
When he died in 60ad, the Romans tried to
take all his money.

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,510
Roman soldiers attacked Boudica and her daughters.

41
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,950
Boudica was angry.

42
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,660
Soon she had an army of Britons behind her.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,330
They attacked Colchester, London and St Albans
- the three most important cities in Britain

44
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,560
at that time - and destroyed them completely.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
But in the end, the Romans defeated her.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,020
There is a story that her body lies under
London s most famous railway station, Kings

47
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,100
Cross.

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,290
In many places around the country you can
still see the straight roads, strong walls

49
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,950
and fine houses that the Romans built.

50
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,250
In the new Roman towns, Britons started to
live like Romans.

51
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,240
They wore Roman clothes and went to the theatre
and the baths.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,910
Most townspeople could speak Latin.

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,580
Many could read and write it too.

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,300
In the later years of Roman rule they became
Christian.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,890
The Angles and Saxons

56
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:38,700
But in 409 the Roman army left Britain to
fight in other parts of the Empire.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,620
Soon after this, invaders from present-day
Germany and Denmark, the Angles and Saxons,

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,680
came to Britain.

59
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,709
The Angle and Saxon armies destroyed everything
in their path, and the Roman way of life disappeared

60
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,019
from Britain.

61
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,820
Many Britons moved west to escape the invaders.

62
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,160
By the 7th century, groups of Britons were
in control of present-day Scotland, Wales

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,879
and Cornwall, but Angles and Saxons ruled
the rest of Britain.

64
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,709
People started to call this area 'Angle-land'.

65
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,569
Later its name became 'England'.

66
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,569
The Vikings

67
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:26,340
Then, at the end of the 8th century, new invaders
started attacking the coasts of Britain - Vikings

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,789
from Scandinavia.

69
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,669
At first they came to steal gold and silver
from monasteries.

70
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,389
Then some made their homes in Britain, and
from the 860s they controlled a large area

71
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,870
of northern and eastern England.

72
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,229
The Saxon kings fought against them.

73
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:50,379
Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings and
sent them away from Britain.

74
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:58,830
But they returned, and in the early 11th century
there was a Viking king of England, King Cnut.

75
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,919
The Normans

76
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,669
The Normans came next.

77
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:09,599
Their conquest was probably the most important
in British history because it was the last.

78
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:16,800
Since 1066 and the Battle of Hastings, many
people have moved to Britain from other countries.

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,219
For example, a lot of French and Dutch Protestants
arrived in the 17th century to escape problems

80
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:25,110
with the Catholics in their homelands.

81
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,999
And in the 20th century large numbers of people
came from India, the Caribbean and other places

82
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,360
that were in the British Empire.

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,680
But no foreign army has conquered Britain
since the Normans.

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,969
William the Conqueror had to fight other Saxon
armies in England after Harold was defeated.

85
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:48,460
But then he was able to build a new, Norman
England.

86
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,099
By 1068, he owned all the land.

87
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,060
He asked his Norman friends to look after
it for him.

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,720
They made money from the farmland and paid
some of it to the king.

89
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,219
They also used the money to pay for Norman
soldiers.

90
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:11,349
Each Norman lord built a home with strong,
high walls and lived there with his private

91
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,659
army.

92
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,199
The Saxons owned nothing.

93
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,819
They belonged to the Norman lords.

94
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,150
For more than two hundred years the language
of government and literature was the Normans'

95
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,340
language, French.

96
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:32,039
The Saxons continued to speak their own language,
Anglo-Saxon, with some Scandinavian words.

97
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,159
The Saxons' language finally grew into modern
English, but as a result of the Norman invasion,

98
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:44,520
half the words in today's English language
come from French.

99
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
CHAPTER TWO

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,539
The United Kingdom

101
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,569
England is a country but it isn't a state.

102
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,479
It is part of a state called 'The United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.

103
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,559
This name is less than a hundred years old,
but English rule in other parts of the United

104
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:07,870
Kingdom started soon after the time of William
the Conqueror.

105
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,830
Wales

106
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,659
When England was safely under their control,
the Normans started the conquest of Wales.

107
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:19,129
The conquest was completed by William the
Conqueror's son.

108
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:26,399
There were a few years of independence in
the 12th and 13th centuries, but since 1284

109
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,240
the rulers of England have also ruled in Wales.

110
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,370
The Welsh language is still spoken by half
a million people.

111
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,039
Scotland

112
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,529
Scotland stayed independent much longer than
Wales - until the end of the 13th century,

113
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,470
when it was conquered by the English king,
Edward I.

114
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,580
But thirty years later it became independent
again.

115
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,229
England and Scodand finally came together
in 1603.

116
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:00,819
Queen Elizabeth I of England died without
children, and her nearest relative was James,

117
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,199
King of Scotland.

118
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,830
During the next century the two countries
had the same kings and queens, but different

119
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,779
parliaments and laws.

120
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,719
Twice in that time, the English parliament
chose a new king for both countries.

121
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,259
The Scots were very angry.

122
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,479
Some wanted war with their more powerful neighbor.

123
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,289
But others saw a better future.

124
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,580
England was growing rich from its empire abroad.

125
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,590
Scotland was failing to build its own empire.

126
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:37,190
So Scotland should join England, and as one
country they could enjoy the empire together.

127
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,100
The English liked this idea, but the Scots
weren't so sure.

128
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,970
Finally, in 1707, the Scottish parliament
voted to join England.

129
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,930
(Many Scottish politicians were paid to vote
this way.)

130
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,010
Scotland lost its own parliament and the Scottish
politicians moved south to London.

131
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,350
England, Scotland and Wales were now one state:
Great Britain.

132
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,570
When Scotland joined England, the two countries'
differences didn't just disappear.

133
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:16,250
In 1715, and again in 1745, people from the
Highlands, in the northwest of Scotland, and

134
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,410
from other areas fought to have a new king.

135
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,260
They were defeated both times.

136
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,060
In 1745, the English destroyed complete villages.

137
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,960
Many people were killed, and the 'lucky' ones
were sent abroad.

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,400
The Scots never fought the English again.

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,500
By the end of the 18th century, they were
joining the British army in large numbers

140
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,010
and playing an important part in the government
of the British Empire.

141
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,770
Ireland

142
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,770
Ireland's story was very different.

143
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,690
Ireland was first conquered by an army from
Britain in 1171.

144
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:02,060
The Irish finally won independence for most
of their island in 1922.

145
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,560
In all that time, British rule brought Ireland
very little money and a lot of trouble.

146
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,460
The Norman invasion of Ireland in 1171 was
the idea of an Irish king, Dermot of Leinster.

147
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,220
When he stole another king's wife, he lost
power over his lands.

148
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,910
He asked the English king, Henry II, for help.

149
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,310
Henry sent an army, and the island of Ireland
has never been completely independent since

150
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,780
then.

151
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,860
Henry II

152
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,090
Henry II became King of England because of
his Norman mother.

153
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,770
He was the first king from the Plantagenet
family that ruled England after the Normans.

154
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,320
He also ruled the French lands of his wife
and his father.

155
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,650
At its greatest, his empire reached from Ireland
to the Pyrenees, mountains in the south-west

156
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,030
of France.

157
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:03,010
The kings of England continued to rule lands
in France until 1557.

158
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,760
Norman lords ruled the area around Dublin,
and most of the time they were independent

159
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,220
of the government in England.

160
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,230
Irish kings continued to control the rest
of the country.

161
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,500
Little changed until the 16th century, when
most people in Britain became Protestant.

162
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,560
Most Irish people stayed Catholic.

163
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,530
The Catholics tried to push the Protestants
out of Ireland, but they failed.

164
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:35,120
In 1607, the last Catholic lords left the
country and, for the first time, all of Ireland

165
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,200
was controlled by England.

166
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,650
The Protestant rulers of England wanted to
make Ireland less Catholic.

167
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,390
So they decided to send large numbers of Scottish
Protestants there.

168
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,490
Most of these Scots made their home in the
north of Ireland, and their families still

169
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,280
live there today.

170
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,180
The Irish Catholics didn't like the Protestants
in the north or the English government.

171
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:05,930
In every British war of the 17th century,
the Catholics fought for the side that lost.

172
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,980
As a punishment, Catholics in the early 18th
century couldn't own land, or even a good

173
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,730
horse.

174
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,530
There was an Irish parliament, but Catholics
couldn't vote or be politicians.

175
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,480
Irish Catholics became very poor, and the
rich Protestant landowners weren't interested

176
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,820
in their problems.

177
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,970
Some of the laws against Catholics were changed
after a few years, but too little was done

178
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,350
too late.

179
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,730
In 1798, the Irish fought unsuccessfully for
independence from England.

180
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,500
After this, the English decided to end the
Irish parliament.

181
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,430
Irish politicians, like the Scots before them,
moved to London.

182
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,540
There, they joined the parliament of a state
that was now called the United Kingdom of

183
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,380
Great Britain and Ireland.

184
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,840
Most Catholics in Ireland ate little except
the potatoes that they grew on their very

185
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,850
small farms.

186
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,930
In the 1840s, potatoes failed to grow in Europe.

187
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,930
In most countries this was not a serious problem,
because there was other food.

188
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,010
But in Ireland the result was terrible.

189
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,100
People started to die.

190
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,200
The British government did very little to
help.

191
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,720
The Church of England offered free food, but
only to people who became Protestant.

192
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,140
Of a population of eight and a half million,
about one million died and another million

193
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,230
went abroad, most of them to the US.

194
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,260
The Catholic dream of an independent Ireland
continued.

195
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,100
After battles in Parliament and in the streets
of Irish cities, independence finally came

196
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,340
in 1922.

197
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,250
But the Protestants in the north refused to
be part of a Catholic Irish state.

198
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,130
So Ireland was cut in two.

199
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,440
Northern Ireland continued to be part of the
United Kingdom.

200
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Northern Ireland

201
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,600
About 35 percent of the people in Northern
Ireland were Catholic.

202
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,730
They wanted to be part of the independent
state of Ireland.

203
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,310
The Protestants were afraid of the Catholics,
so they controlled the votes for politicians

204
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,930
unfairly.

205
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,020
They also kept the best jobs and houses for
themselves.

206
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,900
In the 1960s, Catholic demonstrations were
stopped violently.

207
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,750
So the British government sent their army
to protect the Catholics.

208
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,810
But Catholics didn't want the British army
in their country.

209
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:40,190
A Catholic group, the IRA, started to fight
for independence from Britain in the north.

210
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,420
When the first IRA fighter shot a British
soldier, many Catholics were pleased.

211
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:51,410
The IRA killed British soldiers and Protestant
policemen and politicians.

212
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,520
Later they killed anyone who was Protestant
or British.

213
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,480
Catholic violence was answered with more violence
by the British army and the Protestant Irish.

214
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,380
Terrible things were done by all sides, but
perhaps the worst violence has now passed.

215
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,490
In the last few years, IRA activity has stopped.

216
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,740
Many Catholic and Protestant politicians,
and the British and Irish governments, are

217
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,200
trying to build a Northern Ireland which is
free of violence and fair for all.

218
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,871
National parliaments

219
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:28,920
The Welsh and Scots haven't fought battles
against the English for many centuries, but

220
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,980
the idea of independence from England never
really died.

221
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,510
England is the biggest of the four countries
in the United Kingdom, so it has the largest

222
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,560
number of politicians in the parliament in
London.

223
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,670
Many people in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland felt that the London parliament didn't

224
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,550
do enough for them.

225
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:56,029
In the 1990s, the Scots, Welsh and Northern
Irish were given their own parliaments.

226
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:01,490
They still have politicians in London, but
they have others in their own capitals: Edinburgh,

227
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,090
Cardiff and Belfast.

228
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:10,400
These national parliaments make some decisions,
for example about schools and hospitals, but

229
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:17,630
tax, the army and other important matters
are still controlled from London.

230
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,630
CHAPTER THREE

231
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,529
God and Government

232
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:25,400
Henry VIII was king of England in the early
16th century.

233
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,420
He was handsome and clever.

234
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,090
He loved sport, music and dance.

235
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,870
No king was ever more popular with his people.

236
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,190
But he was worried.

237
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,530
He didn't have a son to follow him as King.

238
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,630
In the half-century before Henry's rule, England
suffered terribly as two families fought for

239
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,810
control of the country.

240
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,820
Now these wars were finished and Henry's family,
the Tudors, were in control.

241
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,630
But the wars could easily start again after
his death.

242
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:01,880
For Henry, a son was very important - more
important even than his people's religion.

243
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,950
Catholic Britain

244
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,389
From the 7th century, almost everyone in Britain
was a Roman Catholic.

245
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:13,079
By the time of Henry VIII, the Catholic Church
was very powerful.

246
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,610
In those days, only a few people reached the
age of fifty.

247
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:23,100
Life after death was very important to them,
and for this they needed the Church.

248
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,470
Even the poorest farmers gave the Church 10
percent of the food that they produced.

249
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,100
They also worked on Church land without payment.

250
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,749
Rich families gave large amounts of money.

251
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:40,139
Everyone believed that they were buying a
better life after death.

252
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:46,110
The Church became very rich - much richer
than the King of England.

253
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,749
Henry VIII: two women, two churches

254
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:53,480
Katharine of Aragon was a Spanish princess.

255
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,260
She was married to Henry's older brother.

256
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,980
He died young and Henry, as the future king,
decided to marry Katharine.

257
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,950
She was useful to England because Spain was
one of the most powerful countries in Europe.

258
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,400
A Christian couldn't usually marry his brother's
wife, but the head of the Catholic Church,

259
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,639
the Pope, gave special permission.

260
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:21,450
Henry VIII and Katharine of Aragon had only
one child - a daughter, Mary.

261
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,919
When no son came, Henry looked for a reason.

262
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,899
He decided that his marriage to his brother's
wife was wrong.

263
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:33,380
As a punishment, he and Katharine had no sons.

264
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,130
Henry was always interested in other women,
but now he fell completely in love with a

265
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,440
young Englishwoman, Anne Boleyn.

266
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,659
She was much younger than Katharine.

267
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:49,809
She was clever and funny and maybe she could
give Henry a son.

268
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,490
Henry sent his assistant, Thomas Wolsey, to
Rome to ask the Pope for an end to his marriage

269
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,110
with Katharine.

270
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,220
But the Pope was the prisoner of one of Katharine's
relatives.

271
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,710
He couldn't agree to Henry's request.

272
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,590
Wolsey went back to England and told his king
the bad news.

273
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,390
Henry was very angry.

274
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,960
He put Wolsey in prison.

275
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,950
Then he made a decision that changed Britain
forever.

276
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,789
The Pope was head of the Catholic Church,
and he was being difficult.

277
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:25,190
So in 1534, Henry closed the Catholic Church
and started a new one, the Church of England,

278
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,110
with a new head - the king.

279
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:35,029
A few politicians and priests spoke in disagreement
against this, so Henry cut off their heads.

280
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:39,820
Henry was the writer of a book which attacked
the religious ideas of the Protestants.

281
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,909
But now his new church followed these Protestant
ideas.

282
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:49,009
The Bible was read in English in church, not
in Latin, and there were no pictures in church

283
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,330
of anyone except Jesus.

284
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,629
For people in the 16th century, these changes
were very serious.

285
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:01,480
But to Henry they didn't matter, because he
was only interested in one thing.

286
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,820
His new church gave him permission to end
his marriage with Katharine.

287
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,750
Then he married Anne Boleyn.

288
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,470
Henry soon realized that his power as head
of the Church was useful in other ways.

289
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,769
He needed money, and the Church had lots of
it.

290
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:21,259
Monasteries owned large areas of land, and
gold and silver too.

291
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,240
So he decided to close them.

292
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,330
Henry took everything.

293
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,999
Many beautiful buildings were destroyed, and
11,000 religious men and women suddenly lost

294
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,649
their homes.

295
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:39,779
You can still see the broken walls of old
monasteries in many parts of Britain today.

296
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,440
Henry's other wives

297
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,370
Sadly for Henry, his new church didn't solve
his marriage problems.

298
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:53,149
When Anne Boleyn gave Henry a daughter, Elizabeth,
but no son, he cut off her head.

299
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:58,169
He finally had a son with his third wife,
Jane Seymour, but she died after the birth

300
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,330
of the baby.

301
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:06,279
His fourth wife was Anne of Cleves, a German
princess who he chose from a picture.

302
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,330
In real life she was very ugly, and he ended
their marriage after six months.

303
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,960
He didn't make the same mistake again.

304
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,799
Catherine Howard was a beautiful English girl
of sixteen when she married Henry, a fat 49-year-old.

305
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,539
But Henry learnt that she had a lover.

306
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,450
He cut off her head.

307
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:32,929
His sixth wife, Catherine Parr, was luckier
than the rest: Henry died before her.

308
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,850
Edward VI

309
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,249
After Henry VIII's death, his nine-year-old
son became king.

310
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:46,889
Edward VI was an unhealthy but very intelligent
boy, and he had strong ideas about religion.

311
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:51,179
He started to make England even more Protestant
than under his father.

312
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,100
But he only lived to the age of fifteen.

313
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,999
There was nobody who could become the next
king.

314
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:01,389
So Edward's older sister Mary became queen.

315
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:02,929
Mary I

316
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:08,230
Mary, Katharine of Aragon's Catholic daughter,
threw out all the Protestant changes that

317
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,600
were introduced by her father and brother.

318
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,149
Most people in England were happy about this.

319
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:17,179
They didn't like Protestant ideas very much.

320
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,740
But then Mary killed lots of Protestants.

321
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,840
In three years, 280 men and women were burned
in front of crowds of people.

322
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,950
Mary became very unpopular.

323
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,700
She was thirty-eight and unmarried when she
became queen.

324
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,831
She hated the idea of Anne Boleyn's Protestant
daughter, Elizabeth, as the next queen, so

325
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,409
she really wanted a child.

326
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,470
She married King Philip of Spain.

327
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,429
Twice she thought she was having his baby.

328
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:49,039
But she had a stomach problem - and it killed
her.

329
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,970
The return of the Catholic Church in England
died with her.

330
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,289
Elizabeth I

331
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:02,120
When Mary's sister Elizabeth became queen,
she tried to find a middle way for religion.

332
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,549
She wanted a Church of England that Protestants
and Catholics could accept.

333
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,100
But this was impossible.

334
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,230
First, the Puritans didn't like it.

335
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:17,610
The Puritans were Protestants who wanted simple
churches and simple clothes for their priests.

336
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:22,159
To them, the Church of England wasn't different
enough from the Catholic Church.

337
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,929
And they didn't want the Queen as head of
the Church.

338
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:28,779
Elizabeth thought that their ideas were dangerous.

339
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:31,970
Many Puritans were put in prison or killed.

340
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,350
Second, the Catholics didn't like it.

341
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,519
The Pope told the people of the Catholic Church
to end Elizabeth's rule.

342
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,000
'Henry VIII's marriage to her mother, Anne
Boleyn, was wrong,' he said.

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,880
He secretly sent European priests to England
to start a Catholic war against the Queen.

344
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,890
So Elizabeth made Catholicism against the
law.

345
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:00,100
People had to pay lots of money if they didn't
go to a Protestant church on Sunday.

346
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,340
Lots of Catholics were put in prison, and
a few were killed.

347
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,179
Catholic priests continued to travel around
the country secretly, but it was very dangerous.

348
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:15,669
There are still many big 16th-century houses
in England with 'priest holes' - secret places

349
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:19,419
for Catholic priests to hide.

350
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:20,419
Mary Queen of Scots

351
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:26,629
Elizabeth's closest relative was her Catholic
cousin, Mary Queen of Scots.

352
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:32,559
In 1567, Mary made the people of Scotland
very angry when she married her husband's

353
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,330
murderer.

354
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:40,610
She had to escape to England, leaving her
baby son James as king of Scotland.

355
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,659
Elizabeth wanted to make her welcome.

356
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:47,659
But to Catholics, Mary was the true queen
of England, because Henry VIII's second marriage

357
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,789
wasn't real.

358
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,320
So Elizabeth had even more problems with her
Catholic enemies.

359
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,149
Mary lived as a prisoner in England for nineteen
years.

360
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:04,359
Finally, Elizabeth's spies proved that Mary
was making plans against Elizabeth.

361
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:07,899
Elizabeth sadly ordered her death.

362
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:08,899
William Shakespeare

363
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:15,830
Elizabeth's rule was a time of danger for
some, but many other people enjoyed life.

364
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,660
Plays became very popular, and England's first
real theatre was built.

365
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,710
The greatest writer for the theatre was William
Shakespeare.

366
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,740
His father was an ordinary trader and he only
went to school, in Stratfordupon-Avon, until

367
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,200
the age of fourteen.

368
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,190
Later he worked in London as a writer and
an actor.

369
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,409
Some of his thirty-seven plays were watched
by the Queen at her palace, and they are still

370
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:44,190
enjoyed around the world today.

371
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,149
The Spanish attack England

372
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:52,549
The next danger for Protestant England came
from the most powerful country in Europe:

373
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:53,879
Spain.

374
00:25:53,879 --> 00:26:02,059
In 1588, the Spanish king, Mary I's husband
Philip, sent 27,000 men in 130 ships to the

375
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,169
English coast.

376
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:06,629
England had little hope of defeating them.

377
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:11,950
Philip's ships tried to join a Spanish army
from the Netherlands.

378
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:17,830
But luckily for England, the wind, and an
attack by English boats, made this impossible.

379
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,190
The Spanish ships were defeated and decided
to return home.

380
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,690
But they hit a terrible storm, and half the
Spanish ships were destroyed.

381
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,270
Spain and the Catholics lost some of their
power in Europe and England continued to be

382
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,559
a Protestant country.

383
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:42,000
When Elizabeth died in 1603, after forty-five
years as queen, most of her people were strongly

384
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,359
Protestant.

385
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:47,399
Religion after Elizabeth

386
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,380
Later in the 17th century, Britain had a Catholic
king, James II.

387
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,409
But by then it was impossible to bring the
people of Britain back to the Catholic Church.

388
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:04,279
After only three years, he had to leave Britain
and a new, Protestant king was chosen.

389
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,759
Today, Christianity doesn't have the same
importance in Britain that it had in earlier

390
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,859
centuries.

391
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,999
The numbers of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs are
growing, and a large part of the population

392
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:18,070
doesn't believe in God.

393
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:25,570
But there are still many more people in the
Church of England than in the Catholic Church.

394
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,700
CHAPTER FOUR

395
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,080
Parliament against King

396
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,129
When Elizabeth I died without children, James
Stuart, the Protestant son of Mary Queen of

397
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,509
Scots, became king.

398
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:41,039
He was already King James VI of Scotland.

399
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,769
In 1603 he moved south to London as James
I of England.

400
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:51,070
James discovered that English and Scottish
parliaments had very different ideas about

401
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,769
their powers.

402
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,259
In Scotland, Parliament passed any laws that
the king wanted.

403
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,340
In England, Parliament wanted to make decisions
too.

404
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,600
This made James's rule very difficult, and
brought even more trouble to his son.

405
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,440
An important battle for control of the country
was beginning.

406
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,970
The Magna Carta

407
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,519
James wasn't the first king who disagreed
with his people about his powers.

408
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,320
Back in the 13th century, King John had similar
problems.

409
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,450
But in those days there was no parliament.

410
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,460
John wasn't a strong ruler.

411
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,589
He started his rule with an empire in France,
but he soon lost most of his French lands

412
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,100
- even Normandy.

413
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,621
His lords chose this time to put controls
on the power of the king.

414
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:46,439
In 1215, with armies behind them, the lords
told King John to agree to the Magna Carta

415
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:49,830
- a list of rules for good government.

416
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:55,109
For example, the state couldn't put someone
in prison without a good reason.

417
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,789
Under the Magna Carta, even the king had to
follow the law.

418
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:02,850
John didn't want to sign the Magna Carta.

419
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,470
In the end he did, but he broke its rules
almost immediately.

420
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,320
The lords attacked him with their armies.

421
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,369
Before he was defeated, John died.

422
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,629
Early parliaments

423
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:22,360
John's nine-year-old son became King Henry
III and the lords went home.

424
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,990
But then, as an adult, Henry decided to start
an expensive war in Sicily (now in the south

425
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,570
of Italy).

426
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,559
The lords worried that he was becoming like
his father, John.

427
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,700
He was interested only in power and not in
his people.

428
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,710
They decided to ask Henry for a parliament
of priests, lords, and ordinary landowners

429
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,889
and businessmen.

430
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:49,820
Without the agreement of this parliament,
the King couldn't have tax money for his Sicilian

431
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
war.

432
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,009
(This idea of a parliament was very new, tried
before only on the Isle of Man, a small island

433
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:59,669
between Britain and Ireland.)

434
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:02,100
The King refused to accept a parliament.

435
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,590
So there was war closer to home.

436
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:11,700
The lords defeated King Henry at the Battle
of Lewes (in the south of England) in 1264.

437
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,350
Henry and his son, Prince Edward, were taken
prisoner.

438
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,580
For the next 18 months England was ruled by
a parliament.

439
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,389
But Prince Edward escaped, formed an army
and defeated the lords.

440
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,119
King Henry was in control again.

441
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,159
Parliament lost much of its power, but it
didn't disappear.

442
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,919
When Prince Edward became King Edward I, he
needed money for his wars in Scotland.

443
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,070
Higher taxes were more acceptable to the people
when they were agreed by a peoples parliament.

444
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:51,470
Slowly, over the next few centuries, Parliament
started to vote for and against new laws too.

445
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:59,450
But it was nearly 400 years before parliament
had as much power as in 1264.

446
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,850
Charles I

447
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:07,840
When James I died in 1625, his son Charles
became king.

448
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,330
Charles I made the problems between king and
parliament even worse.

449
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:18,760
He started a very unsuccessful war against
the Catholic countries Spain and France.

450
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,990
Parliament tried to stop Charles's unfair
taxes for the war, so Charles closed Parliament.

451
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,470
He ruled without it for the next eleven years.

452
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,590
Without a parliament, Charles couldn't have
his people's tax money.

453
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,710
He found other, unfair and unpopular, ways
to get money.

454
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:43,240
Then, when Charles made changes to the Church
of Scotland, violent demonstrations started

455
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,859
in Scottish cities.

456
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:49,789
Charles didn't have enough money for an army
to stop the demonstrations.

457
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,769
So he had to have a parliament again.

458
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:56,340
This new parliament didn't act as the king
wanted.

459
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,340
So Charles closed it after only three weeks.

460
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,840
Charles fought the Scots with men who weren't
professional soldiers.

461
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,929
The Scots won, and took control of a large
part of the north of England.

462
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,840
Charles had to have another parliament.

463
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,490
This parliament stopped Charles's unfair taxes.

464
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,009
But Charles needed soldiers again when there
was violence between Catholics and Protestants

465
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:22,049
in Northern Ireland.

466
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,389
The politicians were worried.

467
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:28,059
'Maybe the king will use the soldiers against
us,' they thought.

468
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:33,549
So they passed a law that Parliament, not
the king, was now in control of the country.

469
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:37,039
And that meant war.

470
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,129
King and Parliament at war

471
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:44,239
In many families, brother fought brother and
father fought son.

472
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:50,840
The King's men won the first battle, but four
years later, Charles I was defeated by Parliament

473
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,929
and its army.

474
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:56,470
Parliament couldn't agree what they should
do next.

475
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:02,029
But in the end a court of law decided that
Charles was an enemy of the people.

476
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:06,489
In 1649, he was killed in front of a large
crowd.

477
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:13,139
His son, Charles II, was made king in Scotland,
but Parliament soon defeated the Scots.

478
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:17,340
Charles II had to escape to the Netherlands,
leaving Parliament and the officers of its

479
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,950
army in control of Britain.

480
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,820
Oliver Cromwell

481
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:28,109
Oliver Cromwell was an officer who fought
for Parliament against the King.

482
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:35,000
He introduced new ideas to his army and turned
his men into excellent professional soldiers.

483
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,739
At the end of the war, he was the most powerful
man in Britain.

484
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:42,169
Parliament offered him the title 'King'.

485
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,759
Cromwell refused it, preferring the title
'Lord Protector'.

486
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:51,399
But for eight years he ruled the country like
the kings before him.

487
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,239
Cromwell was a Puritan, so he disliked music
and dance.

488
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:58,229
Soon all the theatres were closed.

489
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:01,999
Even Christmas was against the law.

490
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,820
The return of the King

491
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,830
When Cromwell died, his son became Lord Protector.

492
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,000
But he wasn't a strong ruler and he couldn't
control the army.

493
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,340
So a group of politicians invited Charles
II to return home.

494
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,150
Most people were very pleased to have Charles
II as king.

495
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,730
But Charles didn't like Parliament, and for
most of his time as king he ruled without

496
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,970
it.

497
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:34,810
That meant no tax money, so he used money
from the King of France.

498
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,840
Britain's last Catholic king

499
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,050
Charles II and his wife had no children.

500
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:47,590
When Charles died in 1685, his Catholic brother
James became king.

501
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:53,919
James II started giving all the important
jobs in the army and the universities to Catholics.

502
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,910
He tried to get Catholics into Parliament.

503
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:03,030
This was a bad idea because Catholics were
hated by most of the population.

504
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:09,310
In 1688, a group of politicians invited Prince
William of Orange, the Protestant Dutch husband

505
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:14,980
(and cousin) of James's daughter Mary, to
bring his army to England.

506
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,090
When James's own army joined Prince William,
James escaped to France.

507
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,930
A new law for kings and queens

508
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,380
Parliament was tired of kings who ruled without
them.

509
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,480
William and his wife Mary were asked to be
king and queen.

510
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,580
But first they had to agree to a new law.

511
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:44,800
There could be no taxes, no army and no new
laws without the agreement of Parliament.

512
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,970
Politicians were now chosen every three years.

513
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,670
And no Catholic could ever become king or
queen.

514
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,800
William and Mary agreed to Parliament's new
law.

515
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,260
But the law didn't give Parliament all the
power that some politicians were hoping for.

516
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:08,140
William was a strong king who didn't leave
the important decisions of government to Parliament.

517
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,880
Parliament didn't have to wait long for more
power.

518
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,390
William and Mary had no children, so Mary's
sister Anne became queen after them.

519
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,510
But when all Anne's children died young, there
was a serious problem.

520
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,810
Who could rule Britain after Anne?

521
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:31,050
There was only one possible person who wasn't
Catholic: the German grandson of James Is

522
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,050
daughter.

523
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,620
He didn't speak English and he didn't like
Britain.

524
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:41,680
But when Anne died in 1714, he became King
George I.

525
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,000
For Parliament, George I was the perfect king.

526
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,360
He wasn't interested in Britain, so Parliament
was left in control of the country.

527
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,090
And Parliament was careful that it never lost
its power again.

528
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:00,190
After 1714, the important decisions were made
by politicians.

529
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:06,230
Today's queen, Elizabeth II, is from the same
family as George I. She is Britain's head

530
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,740
of state, but she has no real power.

531
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,810
CHAPTER FIVE

532
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,810
Power to the People

533
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:21,300
From the 15th century, ordinary people had
the same protection under the law as lords.

534
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,160
But nobody imagined that ordinary workers
had any real power.

535
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,700
Only people with money could vote for politicians
or join Parliament.

536
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,410
Poor people did what they were told.

537
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,520
But then, in the late 18th century, Britain
began to change.

538
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,470
Historians now call the changes 'revolutions'
because they were so important.

539
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,050
There were new types of job, new towns and
new ways to travel.

540
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:55,680
And there were also new powers and protections
for the ordinary workers of Britain.

541
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Revolution in the country

542
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,800
Until the 19th century, most people in Britain
worked on the land.

543
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,750
They grew plants for food and kept farm animals.

544
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,230
They produced butter and cheese.

545
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,550
And in their homes they turned sheep's wool
into cloth.

546
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,350
English cloth was popular everywhere in Europe.

547
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,560
Farmers couldn't use all their fields every
year.

548
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,100
After a few years, the plants became unhealthy,
so they left the field empty for a year.

549
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,210
But in the 18th century, people found new
ways to grow food.

550
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,310
Farmers never had to leave a field empty,
so they could produce more food.

551
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,660
The new ideas for farms could only work on
large areas of land, and most farmers had

552
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,090
small areas in different fields.

553
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,850
In the second half of the 18th century, the
government agreed to give a lot of land to

554
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,720
the most powerful landowners.

555
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,920
Many poorer farmers were left with nothing.

556
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,170
Revolution in towns

557
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,840
Also in the 18th century, there were changes
in the cloth-making business.

558
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,850
New machines helped to make cloth much faster
than before.

559
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,540
The machines were too big to keep at home.

560
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,260
The world's first factories were built.

561
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,010
These factories employed many of the farmers
who lost their land to the big landowners.

562
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,220
Soon large towns grew around the factories.

563
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,240
Manchester and Leeds, for example, grew in
this way.

564
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,560
The factories made cloth from local wool,
and also from American cotton.

565
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,750
British cloth became even more popular in
Europe than before.

566
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,380
When the French Emperor Napoleon, Britain's
great enemy, invaded Russia, his soldiers

567
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,890
were wearing coats of British cloth.

568
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,250
British factories were soon copied in other
European countries and their empires, and

569
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,350
the world changed forever.

570
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:57,530
But these wonderful new machines didn't help
the ordinary people of Britain.

571
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,390
Brunel

572
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:06,030
Many new roads, waterways and bridges were
made in the 18th century Then, in 1804, the

573
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,700
worlds first railway was built.

574
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,810
Britain's greatest railway builder was Isambard
Kingdom Brunei.

575
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,110
He built more than 1,600 kilometers of railway
line.

576
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:23,810
His trains were faster, and his stations and
bridges were more beautiful, than any others.

577
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:28,590
He changed not only train travel, but also
travel across the Atlantic Ocean.

578
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:33,420
He built the first metal passenger ship, and
another ship that was six times bigger than

579
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,330
any other ship at that time.

580
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,260
Many factory owners in the late 18th and early
19th century controlled their workers' lives

581
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,490
in a similar way to the Norman lords 700 years
earlier.

582
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:52,100
Workers weren't paid with money, but with
cards that were only accepted in the factory

583
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
shop.

584
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,290
Adults were paid too little to feed a family.

585
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,800
So their children worked in the factory too,
some for eighteen hours a day, and there were

586
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,700
a lot of accidents.

587
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,480
The factory owners built houses for their
workers, but most of these were cheap and

588
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,220
small, with no clean water.

589
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,180
Illness travelled quickly through the new
towns.

590
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,390
The factory owners grew richer and richer.

591
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,980
But their workers got no more money when the
factory was successful.

592
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,330
If workers started a trade union, they lost
their jobs.

593
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,170
If they refused to work, they weren't paid.

594
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,040
Then their families had no food.

595
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,350
Better laws for workers

596
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,220
Workers became very angry.

597
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,740
There were a lot of demonstrations, and some
people wanted a violent British revolution

598
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,090
like the revolution of 1789 in France.

599
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,340
It was difficult for workers to change things
in any other way.

600
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,400
Ordinary workers didn't own their own houses,
so they couldn't vote.

601
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,830
Some cities, like Manchester and Birmingham,
had no politicians because they were too new.

602
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:04,530
But old towns with small populations had two
politicians.

603
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,030
It was very unfair.

604
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,550
Politicians didn't want a revolution, so they
slowly gave workers more control over their

605
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,150
lives.

606
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:20,330
After a change in the law in 1825, workers
could finally form trade unions.

607
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:26,780
In 1832, the new cities got their own politicians
and more men could vote.

608
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Children's hours of work were also controlled
in the 1830s, and the Government offered children

609
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,470
a few hours a day of free school lessons.

610
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,000
From 1870, all children had to go to school.

611
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,860
Child workers disappeared from British factories.

612
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,280
Votes for all

613
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,510
In the 19th century, more and more men were
given the vote, but women still had no power.

614
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,790
The Suffragettes were a group of women who
wanted to change this.

615
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,710
In the early 20th century they went on violent
demonstrations.

616
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,210
They shouted at politicians in Parliament.

617
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,430
In prison, they refused to eat.

618
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:11,590
One woman was killed when she threw herself
under the King's horse during a race.

619
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:17,330
But when the First World War started in 1914,
these women stopped fighting the Government.

620
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,910
They did the jobs of the men who were away
at war.

621
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:26,370
When the war ended, some women over the age
of 30 and all men over the age of 21 could

622
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,370
vote.

623
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:33,490
Finally, in 1928, the rules for women and
men became the same.

624
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,330
An end to poverty

625
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,350
Workers' lives at the end of the 19th century
were a little better than a hundred years

626
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,870
before.

627
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:47,390
But when, in 1899, new soldiers were needed
for a war in South Africa, large numbers of

628
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,070
young men were too unhealthy for the army.

629
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,760
The Government decided to do more for the
poor of Britain.

630
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,890
In 1906, pay was introduced for people who
couldn't work as a result of illness or old

631
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,170
age.

632
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,240
It was a small amount, but it was something.

633
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,650
After the Second World War ended in 1945,
there was more money from the Government for

634
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,300
old people.

635
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,000
There was also money for families with children
and for people who couldn't find work.

636
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,210
Schools, hospitals, doctors and dentists were
- and still are - free.

637
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,740
Britain was the first state to protect its
people in this way.

638
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,060
Taxpayers have to pay for it, of course.

639
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:36,990
But people are protected from the terrible
poverty and unhealthy lives of earlier centuries.

640
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,140
CHAPTER SIX

641
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,820
Britain's Great Empire

642
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,870
In the 1930s, about a quarter of the world's
population was ruled by the British.

643
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:51,410
'The sun never goes down on our empire,' they
said.

644
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,690
They meant that it was always daytime somewhere
in the Empire.

645
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,830
They also meant that their empire was forever.

646
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,190
Perhaps they didn't remember the history of
their first empire, an empire that was lost

647
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,420
more than 150 years earlier.

648
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,620
British America

649
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:16,040
The religious enemies of Britain's rulers
had the first successes of empire.

650
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,650
In 1620, a group of English Puritans sailed
to America in a boat called the Mayflower.

651
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:28,460
They wanted to practice their religion freely
and openly, and this was impossible in England.

652
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:34,310
They built homes on the east coast of America,
in an area that they called New England.

653
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:38,610
Their first winter was very hard and more
than half of them died.

654
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,520
The rest escaped death only because they had
help from the local people.

655
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,860
In the next few years, many people followed
them across the Atlantic: Puritans and Catholics

656
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:54,270
for religious reasons, and businessmen who
were interested in trade.

657
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:59,340
By the middle of the 18th century, there were
1.6 million British people living in North

658
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,340
America.

659
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:07,230
Then, in 1763, Britain defeated France in
the Seven Years' War and won control of Canada

660
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,930
too.

661
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,300
Sometimes there were attacks by the local
American Indians, so the British Americans

662
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,370
needed protection.

663
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,180
The British government in London wanted taxes
from the Americans to pay for an army.

664
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:25,800
But the Americans had no politicians in Parliament,
so to them the taxes were unlawful.

665
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,700
In 1776 they decided to become independent
from Britain.

666
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,900
Five years of war followed.

667
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,020
Finally, the British accepted that the US
was an independent country.

668
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,680
Only Canada continued to be British.

669
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,950
The British in India

670
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:49,340
On the other side of the world, there was
better news for the British Empire.

671
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,040
In the 17th century a private English company
the East India Company, controlled a few ports

672
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,020
on the west coast of India.

673
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,460
To protect their trade interests in times
of war, the East India Company employed an

674
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,850
army of English officers and Indian men.

675
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:12,550
In 1756 the ruler of Bengal, in north-east
India, attacked British soldiers in his capital,

676
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:13,600
Calcutta.

677
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,510
He put many of them in prison overnight, but
the prison didn't have enough air.

678
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,690
In the morning, most of the soldiers were
dead.

679
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,300
The British called this prison the 'Black
Hole of Calcutta'.

680
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,200
They sent an army to defeat the Bengali ruler.

681
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,920
From this time the real ruler of Bengal was
the East India Company.

682
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,510
Slowly, other Indian states came under British
control.

683
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:44,650
By the middle of the 19th century, all India
was part of the British Empire.

684
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:47,340
British lands around the world

685
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,280
The British Empire was also growing in other
parts of the world.

686
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,070
Criminals were sent abroad because it was
cheaper than prison.

687
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,540
They went to America before it became independent.

688
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:03,840
Then, from 1788, they were sent in large numbers
to Australia.

689
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:09,060
Soon other people were making their homes
there too, and in New Zealand and Canada.

690
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:15,200
If the local people - the Aborigines, Maoris
and American Indians - were lucky, they only

691
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,870
lost their land.

692
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,490
If they were unlucky, they were killed.

693
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:26,420
The area around Cape Town in the south of
Africa became British in 1806 after a war

694
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,130
with the Dutch.

695
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:33,710
It was a useful place because it was halfway
on a ship's journey between Britain and India.

696
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:39,990
Egypt was another useful part of Africa, between
Europe and Asia.

697
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:46,500
Napoleon and his French army invaded Egypt
in 1798 but the British, under Horatio Nelson,

698
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,750
destroyed most of Napoleon's ships in a battle
on the River Nile.

699
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,570
Horatio Nelson

700
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:59,810
British success in 19th-century trade and
empire was only possible because Britain ruled

701
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,590
the seas.

702
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,460
This control was mainly the result of the
sea battles of Horatio Nelson.

703
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,710
Nelson lost an arm in battle and he could
only see out of one eye.

704
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,490
But he knew how to defeat enemy warships.

705
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,870
After his success in Egypt, he fought the
French and Spanish at the Battle of Trafalgar

706
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,380
(1805).

707
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,340
Nelson was killed in the battle, but most
of the enemy ships were destroyed, and Britain's

708
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,730
sea power was made safe for the next hundred
years.

709
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:36,430
The central point of London today is Trafalgar
Square, with Nelson in the middle, made of

710
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,430
stone.

711
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,270
The war against Napoleon

712
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,080
Napoleon had more success in his battles on
land than at sea.

713
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,700
Soon he controlled a large part of Europe.

714
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,420
He planned an invasion of Britain, but then
he changed his mind and invaded Russia - a

715
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,590
big mistake.

716
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:59,290
He lost three-quarters of the 450,000 soldiers
who went with him.

717
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:04,780
At the same time, the British army pushed
his soldiers out of Spain and Portugal.

718
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:12,880
Finally, in 1815, he was defeated by Britain
and Prussia at the Battle of Waterloo.

719
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,110
Empire in Africa

720
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:20,880
France and Britain continued to build their
empires, in Asia and in Africa.

721
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,840
Other European countries - Italy, Germany,
Belgium - joined them in a race to rule Africa.

722
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,400
The British fought for a long time against
the African Zulus and the Dutch-speaking white

723
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,310
Boers for control of South Africa and its
gold.

724
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:41,150
They moved north from there, and south from
Egypt, until they controlled land from the

725
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,470
top to the bottom of Africa.

726
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,470
Queen Victoria

727
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,840
Victoria became queen in 1837, at the age
of eighteen.

728
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,750
She had little real power over the worlds
most powerful country, but politicians listened

729
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,940
to her strong opinions.

730
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:03,890
She loved the idea of empire and she was pleased
with the title 'Empress of India'.

731
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,850
She was the mother of nine children and the
grandmother of most of the kings and queens

732
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,650
of Europe.

733
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:16,830
When she died in 1901, very few people remembered
a time before the Victorian Age.

734
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,430
The First World War

735
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:26,480
By the early years of the 20th century, Germany,
not France, was Britain's biggest enemy.

736
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,900
German factories were becoming more successful
than British ones, and the Germans were starting

737
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,770
to build a lot of warships.

738
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,380
The British didn't want to lose their control
of the seas.

739
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,130
They started a race to build more warships.

740
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:45,120
At that time the countries of Europe were
grouping together for protection against their

741
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:51,310
enemies: France and Russia against Germany,
Austria-Hungary and Italy.

742
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:54,840
The British decided to join with France and
Russia.

743
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:00,450
When the future emperor of Austria was murdered
by the Serbs in 1914, the Russians joined

744
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,530
the Serbs in war against the Austrians.

745
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,210
This was the start of the First World War.

746
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,231
People from Britain and the Empire fought
against the Germans in Belgium and the north

747
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:16,290
of France, and against the Turks in Gallipoli
(north-west Turkey).

748
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,490
It was a new type of war.

749
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:21,540
Nobody knew how to defeat enemy machine guns.

750
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,200
The numbers of dead went higher and higher.

751
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:31,680
On a single day in 1916, 20,000 British soldiers
were killed.

752
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,560
In the end, the Americans fought with the
British, and the Germans and Austrians were

753
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,560
defeated.

754
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,980
But there were no real winners in this terrible
war.

755
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,560
The 1920s and 1930s

756
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,890
Lands from the German and Turkish empires
became British, but there was trouble after

757
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,770
the war in other parts of the Empire.

758
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:57,750
Much of Ireland became independent and India
wanted independence too.

759
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,900
Japan's power in Asia was growing.

760
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,790
Were the British areas of Asia safe?

761
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,080
Britain wasn't as rich as before the war.

762
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,100
In the 1930s, many factories closed and workers
lost their jobs.

763
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,470
A lot of people were unable to feed their
families.

764
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,730
When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany,
the British didn't want another war.

765
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,890
There wasn't enough money for a strong British
army.

766
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:29,480
And Hitler only wanted land that Germany lost
after the First World War.

767
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,800
But Hitler wanted more and more land.

768
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,530
When he took control of Austria and Czechoslovakia
(now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), the

769
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,980
British did nothing.

770
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,050
But it became clear that he was a danger to
all Europeans.

771
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:51,160
There were stories that he was sending large
numbers of German Jews to prison for no reason.

772
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:57,370
When he invaded Poland in 1939, the Second
World War began.

773
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,370
The Second World War

774
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:02,730
At first the war went badly for Britain.

775
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,830
British soldiers went to France, but they
were soon pushed out again by the powerful

776
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,630
German army.

777
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,680
By 1940, France was under German control.

778
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,440
Hitler was making plans to invade Britain.

779
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,210
First, he had to win control of the skies
above Britain.

780
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:22,900
The Battle of Britain was the first real air
battle in history.

781
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,150
German and British planes fought for three
months, but the Germans couldn't defeat the

782
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,750
British airmen.

783
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:34,360
Finally, like Napoleon before him, Hitler
chose to invade Russia, not Britain.

784
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,620
And like Napoleon's, his invasion failed.

785
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,460
The US was now fighting on the same side as
Britain, and together they pushed the Germans

786
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,780
out of France.

787
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,190
At the same time the Russians were pushing
the Germans back through the countries of

788
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,080
Eastern Europe.

789
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,800
By May 1945, Germany was defeated and Hitler
was dead.

790
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,750
But the war in Asia continued.

791
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:05,060
Japan joined Germany in the war in 1941 and
took control of many British lands in Asia.

792
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:10,010
A quarter of a million British and American
soldiers and ordinary people were made prisoners

793
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,060
by the Japanese.

794
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,730
But the Americans finally defeated the Japanese
in the Pacific Ocean.

795
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,850
The British pushed them out of Burma and India.

796
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:24,750
In August 1945, Japan was defeated.

797
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,650
Winston Churchill

798
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:31,860
Churchill was from an important family of
lords and politicians and he joined Parliament

799
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,670
at the age of 25.

800
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:41,190
In the 1930s, he realized before most people
in Britain that Hitler was very dangerous.

801
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,990
When the Second World War began, he soon became
head of the government.

802
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:50,860
Because of his powerful speeches in the most
difficult months of the war, the British started

803
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,580
to believe that they could win.

804
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,890
Churchill played a very important part in
the war against Hitler.

805
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:01,940
The end of the Empire

806
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,440
After the Second World War, Britain couldn't
keep control of its empire.

807
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:12,740
India and Pakistan became independent in 1947,
and most other countries in the empire soon

808
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,740
followed.

809
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:22,000
Hong Kong stayed British for a much longer
time, but in 1997 it became part of China.

810
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,320
When the countries of the Empire became independent,
most of them joined the Commonwealth.

811
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:32,740
This is a group of states that work together
on many important matters, like business,

812
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,710
health and the fight against poverty.

813
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:40,410
The British queen is still the head of the
Commonwealth.

814
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,630
Britain's place in the world today

815
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:48,500
Britain is part of the Commonwealth and the
European Union and, as a result of its history

816
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,790
and language, it works closely with the US
too.

817
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:57,290
Britain's days of world power have ended,
but it is still richer and more powerful than

818
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,930
most countries in the world.

819
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:05,910
Without its empire, Britain is a small country
again - but a small country with a big history.

820
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:06,440
- THE END -
