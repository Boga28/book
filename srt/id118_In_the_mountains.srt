00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,880
CHAPTER ONE
Mountains

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,300
Mountains are high places on Earth.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,120
Earth has a crust.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,889
Earth's crust moves very, very slowly.

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:22,650
It can move up and make mountains.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,560
Mountains are very high.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,399
Mount Everest is about 8,850 meters high.

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,910
Mountains are very old, too.

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:46,090
Some mountains are millions of years old.

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,239
Volcanoes are mountains.

11
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,230
A volcano is a hole in Earth's crust.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,590
Under Earth's crust, there's hot rock.

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,400
The hot rock comes out of the volcano.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,659
Volcanoes can be dangerous.

15
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,350
CHAPTER TWO
People

16
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,740
Living in the mountains can be difficult for
people.

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,630
High in the mountains, there aren't any big
roads.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,600
Some people don't have a car.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,540
They use animals for transportation.

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,430
High in the mountains, some people don't have
electricity.

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,820
Look at this house.

22
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,570
Now look at the mountains.

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,800
They are the same color.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,910
People use rocks from the mountains to make
their homes.

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:02,960
In the mountains, people grow food near their
homes.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,140
Some people make terraces and they grow food
there.

27
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,620
On some terraces, there's lots of water.

28
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,020
People grow rice in the water.

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,830
CHAPTER THREE
Animals

30
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,950
In the mountains, you can see amazing animals.

31
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:37,680
Golden eagles live in the mountains in Asia,
North America, Africa, and Europe.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,700
They make nests on high rocks.

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,080
Golden eagles have big wings.

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,230
They can fly very high.

35
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,260
They can see very well, too.

36
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,010
They eat small animals.

37
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:11,600
From high in the sky, they can see small animals
on the ground.

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,210
Many mountain animals have thick fur.

39
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:24,000
Their fur helps them to stay warm.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,990
Snow leopards live in the mountains in Asia.

41
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,760
They have big paws with lots of fur.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,630
This fur helps them to walk on snow and ice.

43
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,650
Alpacas Live in the mountains in South America.

44
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,510
Some alpacas have very thick fur!

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,950
CHAPTER FOUR
Plants

46
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,340
Conifers are a type of tree.

47
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,110
Conifers don't have big leaves.

48
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,900
They have small needles.

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,590
On some snowy mountains, there are lots of
conifers.

50
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,840
Conifers can grow in cold places.

51
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,530
Very high in the mountains, it's very cold
and windy.

52
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,560
Trees can't live there.

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,960
Some plants can live very high in the mountains,
but they are small.

54
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,520
There isn't much rain, so the plants have
long roots.

55
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,900
The roots find water under the ground.

56
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Some mountain plants make strong buds.

57
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,890
The buds can stay under the snow in winter.

58
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,380
After the winter, the buds come out of the
snow.

59
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,850
Then the buds open.

60
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,560
CHAPTER FIVE
Ice and Snow

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,710
In the mountains, you can see rivers of ice!

62
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,930
A river of ice is called a glacier.

63
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,150
What makes a glacier?

64
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,050
In winter, lots of snow falls on the mountains.

65
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:48,810
Then, new snow falls on the old snow and makes
ice.

66
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,670
The ice moves down the mountain in a glacier.

67
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,780
Glaciers move very, very slowly.

68
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,110
In some glaciers, there are big crevasses.

69
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,240
Crevasses are holes in the ice.

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,760
Crevasses are dangerous.

71
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,550
In snowy weather, people don't see a crevasse.

72
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,650
Then they can fall in.

73
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,740
Avalanches are dangerous, too.

74
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,800
In an avalanche, lots of snow falls from the
mountain.

75
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,760
It can fall on people.

76
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,420
CHAPTER SIX
Summer Sports

77
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,150
In summer, some people climb mountains.

78
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,480
Climbers have a helmet and a rope.

79
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,990
Climbing is a difficult sport.

80
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,550
Climbers have strong arms and legs.

81
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,930
Climbers find good rocks for their hands and
feet.

82
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,810
On some mountains, there's snow in summer!

83
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,960
Mountain biking is a summer sport.

84
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,090
Mountain bikes have big, strong wheels.

85
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,570
The wheels are good on rocks.

86
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,820
Rafting is a great summer sport.

87
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,800
For rafting, people have a helmet and a lifejacket.

88
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,580
Rafts are very strong.

89
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:55,800
They can go over rocks in the water.

90
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,080
CHAPTER SEVEN
Winter Sports

91
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,139
Can you ski?

92
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,820
Lots of children go skiing in the mountains
in winter.

93
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,300
They go with their family or with their school.

94
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,949
Snowboarding is a winter sporty, too.

95
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,940
Snowboarding is difficult.

96
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,770
Snowboarders fall in the snow a lot.

97
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,940
Good snowboarders can do amazing tricks.

98
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,720
Do you like walking in the mountains?

99
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,750
You can walk in snowshoes.

100
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:52,920
Snowshoes are big so you can walk on the snow.

101
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,480
Sledding is a great sport.

102
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,180
You can go very fast on a sled.

103
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:09,960
In the Olympic Games, sleds can go at 140
kilometers an hour!

104
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,450
CHAPTER EIGHT
Be Careful!

105
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,461
Mountains can be dangerous.

106
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:21,100
You can fall or get lost.

107
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,420
In the mountains helicopters come and help
people.

108
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:37,250
The weather in the mountains can be nice and
sunny, but it can be cloudy and rainy too.

109
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,740
High in the mountains it is cold, so take
warm clothes.

110
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,980
Take water when you walk in the mountains.

111
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,600
Don't drink water from a river.

112
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,310
Take food.

113
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,839
It's good to eat cheese, bread, fruit, and
chocolate.

114
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,540
Take a map and a compass, too.

115
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,830
Have fun in the mountains, but be careful!

116
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,130
- THE END -
