00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,990
CHAPTER ONE
The Two Sisters

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,340
It was the year 1757.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,940
The place was the dangerous and wild land,
west of the Hudson River.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,470
It was the third year of the war in North
America.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,380
The war was between England and France.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,100
Each country wanted the land for itself.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,020
Indian tribes had always lived in that land.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,550
In the war, some tribes were fighting for
the French.

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,460
Other tribes were fighting for the English.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,730
Fort Edward was on the Hudson River.

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,600
General Webb was the commander of the English
army at Fort Edward.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,020
He was waiting for news of General Montcalm.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,030
Montcalm was the commander of the French army.

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,830
The news came one morning.

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,530
An Indian called Magua arrived.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:16,270
'Montcalm and the French army are coming towards
Fort William Henry,' Magua told General Webb.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,689
Fort William Henry was fifteen miles away.

18
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,030
It was at the south end of Lake Horican.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,030
'How many men has Montcalm got?' asked Webb.

20
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,249
'As many as the leaves on the trees,' said
Magua.

21
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:39,960
'General Munro wants more soldiers at Fort
William Henry.'

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,720
'I will send fifteen hundred men,' said General
Webb.

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,609
General Munro was the commander of rhe English
army at Fort William Henry.

24
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,219
He had two daughters - Cora and Alice.

25
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:04,090
Cora was about twenty-three years old and
Alice was eighteen.

26
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:13,430
Cora had dark hair and a beautiful face, Alice
had fair hair and blue eyes.

27
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,849
These two young women were at Fort Edward.

28
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,680
But they were going to travel to Fort William
Henry.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,879
They were going to meet their father.

30
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,709
General Webb spoke to Cora and Alice.

31
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:35,580
'Magna knows a secret path through rhe forest,'
said General Webb, 'He will be your guide.

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,400
Magua and Major Duncan Heyward will take you
to Fort William Henry.'

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,700
Major Duncan Heyward was a young English officer.

34
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,700
He and the two young women left Fort Edward.

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,470
They rode on horses.

36
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,580
Magua walked in front of them.

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,900
Alice watched Magua.

38
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,079
'I don't like him, Cora,' she said.

39
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,219
'What do you think?

40
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,159
Will we be safe in the forest with Magua?'

41
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,680
'We must trust Magua,' said Cora,

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,790
'The French know our soldiers' paths,' said
Duncan.

43
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,349
'But Magua's path is secret.'

44
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:24,520
He smiled at Alice, and she smiled at him,
Duncan Heyward was in love with Alice.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,400
'Magua is a Huron,' said Duncan.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,819
'But he lived with the Mohawks.

47
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,189
The Mohawks are friends of the English.

48
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,480
Magua came to us.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,379
Your father-' Duncan stopped.

50
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:46,489
Then he said, 'But I don't remember all the
story.'

51
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:49,069
Duncan knew more about Magua.

52
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,330
But he did not tell Cora and Alice.

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,299
He did not say, 'A few years ago, your father's
men beat Magua.

54
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,870
Now Magua hates your father.'

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,620
Duncan did not want to frighten the young
women.

56
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:26,500
So they followed Magua through the forest.

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,650
CHAPTER TWO
Lost in the Forest

58
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,889
A few miles west of Fort Edward, three men
were sitting near a river.

59
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,890
Two of the men were Indians.

60
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,350
The other man was a white man.

61
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,520
Chingachgook and his son, Uncas, were Mohicans.

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,520
The white man was a scout called Hawk-eye.

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,889
Hawk-eye had a long hunting- gun.

64
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,900
The three men were talking.

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,140
'My tribe is the oldest Indian tribe,' Chingachgook
said.

66
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,210
'The blood of the Mohican chiefs is in me.

67
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,449
Many summers ago, my tribe came here to the
land of the Delawares.'

68
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,470
'Where are the Mohicans now?' asked Hawk-eye.

69
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,180
'Where are the flowers of those summers?'
said Chingachgook.

70
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,180
'Gone.

71
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,669
All dead.

72
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:33,850
After my death, Uncas will be the last of
the Mohicans.'

73
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,099
Suddenly, they heard a noise.

74
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,340
They turned quickly.

75
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,810
Hawk-eye lifted his gun.

76
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,729
'Who is it?' he said.

77
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,979
Duncan Heyward rode out of the forest.

78
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,750
Cora and Alice followed him.

79
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,290
'I am an English officer,' Duncan said.

80
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,370
'We have come from Fort Edward.

81
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,860
How far is it to Fort William Henry?'

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Hawk-eye laughed.

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,000
'Fort William Henry?

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,370
You are going the wrong way,' he said.

85
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,690
'You are near Glenn's Falls.'

86
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,090
'The wrong way!' said Duncan.

87
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,379
'Then we are lost.

88
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,280
But our Indian guide-'

89
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,650
'You have an Indian guide but you are lost
in the forest?' said Hawk-eye.

90
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,680
'That is very strange.

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,900
Is he a Delaware?'

92
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,100
'He is called Magua.

93
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,970
He is a Huron,' said Duncan.

94
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,979
'But he lives with the Mohawks, and he is
a guide for the Eng-'

95
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,930
'A Huron!' said Hawk-eye quickly.

96
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,260
'You can trust a Mohican or a Delaware.

97
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,039
But you cannot trust a Huron!

98
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,849
Your guide will lead you to his friends.

99
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,810
They will kill you.

100
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,020
Let me see him.'

101
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,500
Magua was standing behind Cora's horse.

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,240
Hawk-eye looked at him.

103
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,800
Then he went and spoke to Chingachgook and
Uncas.

104
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,150
Magua moved quickly.

105
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,160
He ran into the forest.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,340
Hawk-eye, Chingachgook and Uncas ran after
him.

107
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,139
But Magua escaped.

108
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,270
'What can I do?'

109
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,270
thought Duncan.

110
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,650
'We are lost.'

111
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,930
He turned to Hawk-eye.

112
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,479
'Will you take us to Fort William Henry?'
he asked.

113
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,430
'We will give you money.'

114
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,690
Hawk-eye looked at Cora and Alice.

115
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,729
'We will take you,' he told Duncan.

116
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,909
'Money is not important.

117
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,960
We will not leave you and the two young women
here.

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
Magua and his Huron friends will find you.

119
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,840
Come now - quickly!'

120
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,240
Duncan and Hawk-eye spoke to Cora and Alice.

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,810
The sisters got off their horses.

122
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,539
The Mohicans took the animals away.

123
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:58,550
'They will hide the horses until the morning,'
said Hawk-eye.

124
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,830
He pulled a canoe from the tall grass at the
side of the river.

125
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,319
'Get into the canoe,' he said.

126
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,330
'We will go to a cave and we will stay there
tonight.'

127
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,740
Duncan, Cora and Alice got into the canoe.

128
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,139
Hawk- eye pushed the canoe to the middle of
the river.

129
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,759
Then he got into the canoe.

130
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,280
He started to paddle along the river.

131
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,580
Soon they heard the sound of a great waterfall
in front of them - Glenn's Falls.

132
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:52,990
A few minutes later, they saw 

133
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:01,010
the waterfall.

134
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,959
A few minutes later, Hawk-eye came back with
Chingachgook and Uncas.

135
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,950
The scout led everybody to a cave behind the
waterfall.

136
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,750
The cave was deep and narrow and dark.

137
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,620
Hawk-eye immediately made a fire.

138
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,580
Alice looked at the tall young Mohican, Uncas.

139
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,920
'A strong man is guarding us,' she said quietly
to her sister.

140
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:54,300
'We will be safe tonight.'

141
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,550
CHAPTER THREE
The Fight at Glenn's Falls

142
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,660
Hawk-eye woke Duncan early the next morning.

143
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,040
'We must go,' he said.

144
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
'I will get the canoe.

145
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,340
Wake Miss Cora and Miss Alice.

146
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,889
But do not make any noise.'

147
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,840
Duncan went to the back of the cave.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
'Cora.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
Alice,' he said quietly.

150
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,769
'Wake up.'

151
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,750
Suddenly there were shouts and cries outside.

152
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,550
Duncan ran to the front of the cave.

153
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,089
The sound of guns came from the forest.

154
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,410
There were many Indians on the other side
of the river.

155
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,510
'Hurons!'

156
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,740
thought Duncan.

157
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,380
Then Duncan saw Hawk-eye.

158
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,460
The scout was shooting from the flat rock.

159
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,440
Duncan saw a Huron fall into the rushing water.

160
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Then the other Hurons ran back into the forest.

161
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,779
Hawk-eye came back into the cave.

162
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:01,160
'They have gone,' he said.

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,640
'Will they come back?' asked Duncan.

164
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,529
'Yes, they will come back,' replied Hawk-eye.

165
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,670
'Miss Cora and Miss Alice must stay here in
the cave.

166
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,860
We will go to the rocks and wait for the Hurons.'

167
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:26,899
Duncan, Hawk-eye, Uncas and Chingachgook sat
with their guns.

168
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,649
They sat behind some rocks near the waterfall.

169
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,040
They waited.

170
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,870
Minutes passed.

171
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,950
Then an hour passed.

172
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,660
Suddenly they heard the wild cries of the
Hurons again.

173
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,180
Four Indians ran across the flat rock towards
the cave.

174
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,860
Chingachgook and Uncas fired their guns.

175
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,220
The first two Hurons fell to the ground.

176
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,399
The third Huron jumped on Hawk-eye.

177
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,860
Each man had a knife.

178
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,620
But Hawk-eye was stronger than the Huron.

179
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,529
He killed the Huron with his knife.

180
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,160
The fourth Huron fought with Duncan.

181
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,910
Uncas ran to help the officer.

182
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,240
The young Mohican killed the Huron.

183
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,870
Then Uncas and Duncan ran back to the rocks.

184
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,850
The Hurons on the other side of the river
started to shoot again.

185
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,630
And Chingachgook shot at them.

186
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,200
The shooting went on and on.

187
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,910
Rocks and trees near the cave were broken
in a hundred places.

188
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,449
But Hawk- eye and his friends were not hurt.

189
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:52,589
And Cora and Alice were safe in the cave.

190
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:57,180
Hawk-eye saw a Huron in a tree on the other
side of the river.

191
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,240
The scout lifted his long gun and fired.

192
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,510
There was a cry and the Indian fell from the
tree.

193
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,720
'I have no more bullets,' said Hawk-eye.

194
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,850
'Uncas!

195
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,449
Go to the canoe.

196
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,970
There are some bullets in the canoe.'

197
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,519
Uncas ran quickly across the flat rock.

198
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,260
But he was too late.

199
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,770
A Huron was pushing the canoe across the river!

200
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:33,260
Duncan, Hawk-eye and the two Mohicans went
back to the cave.

201
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,690
'What can we do now?' asked Duncan.

202
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,750
Hawk-eye thought for a few minutes.

203
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,770
'There will be guards on the paths,' he said.

204
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,230
'The Hurons will watch every path.

205
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,080
We must swim.

206
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,399
We must jump into the river.

207
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,310
The rushing water will take us past the Hurons.'

208
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,009
The scout looked at Cora and Alice.

209
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,180
'We cannot swim,' said Cora.

210
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,949
'Alice and I will stay here.

211
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:09,709
Go to General Munro at Fort William Henry.

212
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,470
General Munro must send soldiers.'

213
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:19,930
Chingachgook, Uncas and Hawk-eye talked quietly
together.

214
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,470
Then Chingachgook ran out of the cave and
jumped into the river.

215
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,940
A moment later, Hawk-eye put down his long
gun and followed Chingachgook.

216
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,180
The rushing water took them away.

217
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,370
Cora looked at Uncas.

218
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,810
'Go with them,' she said.

219
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,209
'I will stay,' said the young Mohican.

220
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,420
'No!' said Cora.

221
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,790
'Please, Uncas.

222
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,339
Go with them!'

223
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,149
Uncas was unhappy.

224
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:54,410
But he jumped into the water too.

225
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,610
Cora looked at Duncan.

226
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,160
'I am going to stay,' said Duncan.

227
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,390
He looked at Alice.

228
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:06,690
'I cannot leave you.'

229
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,070
There were shouts and cries from the Hurons
on the flat rock.

230
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,540
Duncan looked out of the cave.

231
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,920
The Hurons were looking behind the rocks near
the waterfall.

232
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,740
'They are looking for us,' thought Duncan.

233
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,430
He went quickly back into the cave.

234
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:29,410
'Our friends will bring help soon,' he said
to Cora and Alice.

235
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,089
Cora was afraid.

236
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,910
Her face was white.

237
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,600
She cried out.

238
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Duncan turned - and he saw the terrible face
of Magua!

239
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,660
'Where are the Mohicans?'

240
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,930
asked Magua.

241
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,850
'Where is the scout, Hawk-eye -The Long Gun?'

242
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,220
Suddenly, the cave was full of Hurons.

243
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,290
One of them picked up Hawk-eye's gun.

244
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,980
'They have gone,' said Duncan.

245
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,589
'They will bring help soon.'

246
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,710
The Hurons were angry.

247
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,420
They were going to kill their prisoners.

248
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,720
But Magua spoke to them, quickly and quietly.

249
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,709
Then the Hurons took Duncan, Cora and Alice
to the flat rock.

250
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,930
One of the Hurons brought the canoe.

251
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,130
'Get into the canoe!'

252
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,410
Magua said.

253
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,210
Duncan and the sisters got into the canoe.

254
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,170
Magua and the Hurons took them across the
river.

255
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,160
The prisoners got out of the canoe on the
other side of the river.

256
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,440
Magua and five Hurons stayed with them.

257
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:56,149
The other Hurons walked away into the forest.

258
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:02,000
CHAPTER FOUR
'I Am a Huron Chief'

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,570
The Hurons and their prisoners started to
walk.

260
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,950
Muyua walked in front of Duncan, Corn and
Alice.

261
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,820
The other Hurons walked behind the prisoners.

262
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,610
They walked across a valley.

263
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,720
Then Magna led them up steep hill.

264
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,640
The land at the top of the hill was flat.

265
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,530
Magua sat down under a tree.

266
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,660
The Hurons started to eat and drink.

267
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,180
Magua shouted to Duncan.

268
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,350
'Send the dark-haired woman to me!'

269
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,460
Cora was afraid.

270
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,570
She went to Magua.

271
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,430
'What do you want?'

272
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,610
she asked,

273
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,500
'I am a Huron chief,' said Magua.

274
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,170
'I lived twenty summers and twenty winters.

275
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,520
I did not see a white man.

276
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,790
I was happy!

277
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,160
Then a white man came to the forest.

278
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,530
He gave me brandy.

279
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,800
The drink was bad for me.

280
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,160
It made me crazy!

281
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,100
My people were angry.

282
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,620
I had to go away, I ran away and lived with
the Mohawks.'

283
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,880
'Then the war started,' said Magua.

284
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,010
'The French and the English were fighting
each other.

285
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,630
The Mohawks were fighting for the English.

286
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,410
The Hurons were fighting for the French.

287
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,070
I was fighting my own people.'

288
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,980
'Your father - Munro - was our chief.

289
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,870
He told the Mohawks, "Do not drink brandy!"

290
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,640
But a white man gave me brandy.

291
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,310
What did Munro do.'

292
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,300
He gave orders to his men.

293
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,370
They tied me with ropes and they beat me!

294
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,010
I will never forget!'

295
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,770
'But-' said Cora.

296
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,770
'Woman!'

297
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,100
shouted Magua.

298
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,150
He stood up quickly.

299
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,840
'You will be my wife!

300
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,520
Your sister will go to Fort William Henry.

301
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,790
She must tell Munro everything.

302
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,240
Then Munro will know.

303
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,180
His daughter lives with mc - Magua.'

304
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,200
'Never!' said Cora.

305
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,330
'I will not be your wife.'

306
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,330
Magua smiled.

307
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,330
'Then you will die,' he said.

308
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,780
'And your friends will die too,'

309
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Then Magua went towards the other Hurons.

310
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,780
He spoke to them.

311
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,000
Duncan ran to Cora.

312
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,220
'What is wrong?' he asked.

313
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,170
'What did Magua say to you?'

314
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,560
'It is not important,' said Cora.

315
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,240
The Hurons were listening to Magua.

316
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,650
Duncan watched them.

317
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,590
They were very angry.

318
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,080
Suddenly, Magua shouted at the Hurons.

319
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,060
They pulled Duncan and the women towards the
trees.

320
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,500
They tied each prisoner to a tree with rope.

321
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,120
Magua stood in front of Cora.

322
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,740
He laughed.

323
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,680
'What does Munro's daughter say now?' he said.

324
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,070
'Shall I send your sister to your father?

325
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,540
Will you follow me to the Great Lakes and
live with me?'

326
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,720
Cora looked at her sister.

327
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,440
'Alice,' said Cora.

328
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,620
'I must go with Magua and be his wife.

329
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,510
Then you and Duncan will live.'

330
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,630
'No!'

331
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,790
shouted Duncan.

332
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,790
'Never!'

333
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,600
'No, no, no!' said Alice.

334
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,170
'Then die!'

335
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,700
shouted Magua.

336
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,160
He threw his knife at Alice.

337
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,160
The knife cut off some of her hair.

338
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,360
It hit the tree above her head.

339
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,940
Duncan shouted angrily.

340
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,140
The Hurons had tied Duncan to a tree.

341
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,060
But he pulled the rope and it broke.

342
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,310
He jumped on a Huron and they fought.

343
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,590
The Huron had a knife.

344
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,800
He was going to kill Duncan.

345
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:43,380
Suddenly a gun fired and the Huron fell dead.

346
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,690
CHAPTER FIVE
Fort William Henry

347
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,150
Hawk-eye ran from the forest.

348
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,220
Chingachgook and Uncas followed him.

349
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,700
There was a fight.

350
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,390
Hawk-eye, Uncas and Duncan killed four Hurons.

351
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,540
Chingachgook jumped on Magua.

352
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,630
The Mohican stabbed Magna with his knife.

353
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,050
Magua fell to the ground.

354
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,970
Hawk-eye and Duncan went and helped the two
women.

355
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,490
But Magua was not dead.

356
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,910
He got up and ran away.

357
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,630
Chingachgook and Uncas ran after him.

358
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,660
'Stop!'

359
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,820
shouted Hawk-eye.

360
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,190
'You cannot catch him.'

361
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,670
'Hawk-eye, how did you find us?'

362
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,810
Duncan asked.

363
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,970
'We waited at the side of the river,' said
Hawk-eye.

364
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,710
'We saw the Hurons take you across the river.

365
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,700
Then we followed you.'

366
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,150
'You saved my life,' said Duncan.

367
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,160
Hawk-eye smiled.

368
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,090
'I found a Huron's gun,' he said.

369
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,870
The Hurons were stupid.

370
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:57,060
They left their guns under the trees.'

371
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,410
Hawk-eye went back to the trees.

372
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,800
He picked up the other guns.

373
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,320
He found his own long gun.

374
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,860
'Now we have guns and bullets,' he said.

375
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,030
'We will stay here tonight.

376
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:18,790
Tomorrow we will go to Fort William Henry.'

377
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,360
Very early the next morning, Hawk-eye woke
his friends.

378
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,470
He led them across the valley and along a
path through the forest.

379
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,710
They stopped near a small river.

380
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,040
'We will walk in the water,' said Hawk-eye.

381
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,520
'Then Magua will not see our footprints on
the ground.'

382
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,730
They walked in the river for an hour.

383
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,860
Then they came to some mountains.

384
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,500
'Walk quietly now!' said Hawk-eye.

385
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,290
'There are French soldiers here.'

386
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,720
They walked to the top of a mountain and looked
down.

387
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,490
There was Lake Horican!

388
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,640
And there was Fort William Henry!

389
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,390
Smoke came from fires in the forest.

390
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,790
'Look at the fires,' said Hawk-eye.

391
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,900
'There are many Hurons in the forest.

392
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,680
They are fighting for the French.'

393
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,050
'And look to the west,' said Duncan.

394
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,080
'Look at those tents.

395
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,780
That is General Montcalm's camp.

396
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,900
There are thousands of French soldiers.'

397
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,250
Suddenly they heard the sound of guns.

398
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:32,380
'The French are shooting at Fort William Henry,'
said Duncan.

399
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,060
'But we must get into the fort.'

400
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,530
'We are lucky,' said Hawk-eye.

401
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,410
Thick fog is coming along the valley.

402
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,290
The fog will hide us from the French.

403
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,920
Follow me!'

404
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,780
Hawk-eye and the Mohicans started to walk
down the mountain.

405
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,840
Duncan and the two sisters followed them.

406
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,750
At the bottom of the mountain, the fog was
very thick.

407
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,130
'Be careful!' said Hawk-eye.

408
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,280
'There are many French soldiers along this
path.

409
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,940
Walk quietly!'

410
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,250
They followed him through the fog.

411
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,970
Suddenly, they heard voices.

412
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,450
'Who is there?' said a soldier in French.

413
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,520
Duncan replied in French.

414
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,760
'A friend of France!' he said.

415
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,610
'Who are you?'

416
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,530
shouted the Frenchman.

417
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,870
But Duncan and his friends walked away quickly.

418
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,430
They went on through the fog.

419
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,780
At last, they arrived at the walls of the
fort.

420
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,640
An English voice shouted from the top of the
wall.

421
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,320
The French are here.

422
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Shoot!

423
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Shoot!'

424
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,090
'Father, Father!'

425
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,090
Alice shouted.

426
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,220
'It is us!

427
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,000
Save your daughters!'

428
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,980
'Don't shoot, men!' said the voice of General
Munro.

429
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,420
'My daughters are here!

430
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,920
Open the gates!'

431
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,080
The gates opened.

432
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,440
Soldiers came out of the fort.

433
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,180
They took everybody inside - Duncan, the young
women, Hawk-eye and the Mohicans.

434
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:30,390
But everybody in Fort William Henry was in
danger.

435
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:35,760
CHAPTER SIX
'When Will Help Come?'

436
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Days passed.

437
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,080
The French army fired their big guns at Fort
William Henry.

438
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,200
Many English soldiers were killed.

439
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,090
General Munro waited.

440
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,510
But General Webb did not send any soldiers.

441
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,840
Munro sent Hawk-eye to Fort Edward with a
message.

442
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,920
General Webb gave Hawk-eye a letter for Munro.

443
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,540
The scout started to go back to Fort William
Henry.

444
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,830
But French soldiers stopped him.

445
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,300
They took the letter.

446
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,110
They tied Hawk-eye's hands with rope.

447
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:20,150
The next morning, Duncan Heyward was standing
by the gates of Fort William Henry.

448
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,340
He saw three men coming towards the fort.

449
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,760
He went to General Munro.

450
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,140
'General Munro,' he said.

451
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,830
'Two French soldiers are at the gates of the
fort.

452
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,200
Hawk-eye is with them.

453
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,700
But when will help come from Fort Edward?'

454
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,360
Hawk-eye came into General Munro's room.

455
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,970
'General Webb gave me a letter for you,' he
said.

456
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,880
'But the French soldiers took it.

457
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,881
General Montcalm wants to speak to you.

458
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:54,040
You must go to his camp.'

459
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,890
A French officer met Munro and Duncan at the
gates of the fort.

460
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,780
They went to General Montcalm's tent in the
French camp.

461
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,630
There were French officers and Indian chiefs
in the tent.

462
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,080
Then Duncan saw Magua.

463
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,160
Magua was fighting for the French!

464
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,560
The Huron looked at Duncan and smiled.

465
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,980
Montcalm spoke first.

466
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,400
He spoke to Munro.

467
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,010
'You have fought well, General,' he said.

468
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,680
'But now you must stop fighting.'

469
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,230
Montcalm gave a letter to Munro.

470
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,770
Munro read it quickly.

471
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,720
Then he gave it to Duncan.

472
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,890
The letter was from General Webb.

473
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,820
...we cannot send any more men.

474
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,380
The Indians have killed too many of my soldiers...

475
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,560
Munro looked at Duncan.

476
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,130
They did not speak.

477
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,420
Then General Montcalm spoke to Munro.

478
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,320
'You and your soldiers must leave Fort William
Henry,' he said.

479
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,550
'You can take your guns.

480
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,300
But do not take your bullets.

481
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,950
Your men, women and children will be safe.

482
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,620
But we will burn the fort.'

483
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,630
General Munro was unhappy.

484
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,910
'We will leave in the morning,' he said.

485
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:28,370
Then he and Duncan went back to the fort.

486
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,410
Magua was angry.

487
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,010
He spoke to the Huron chiefs.

488
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,140
'The English will leave the fort.

489
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,450
The French will not kill them.

490
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,600
But the English are the enemies of the Hurons.

491
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,380
We will kill the English!'

492
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,420
Three thousand English people - soldiers,
women and children - left the fort.

493
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:59,040
They walked past the French soldiers and they
walked towards the forest.

494
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,380
The English soldiers carried their guns.

495
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:09,340
But they had no bullets.

496
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,050
Magua and the Hurons were standing in the
forest.

497
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,860
They watched Fort William Henry.

498
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,720
The English left the fort and walked into
the forest.

499
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,020
Then two thousand Indians attacked!

500
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,670
The English could not fight.

501
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,800
They had no bullets in their guns.

502
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,070
Many of the English were killed.

503
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,600
Alice and Cora saw their father.

504
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,370
He was running towards the French camp.

505
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,790
He was going to find Montcalm.

506
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,280
He was going to ask for help.

507
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,370
'Father!

508
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,470
Father!'

509
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,470
shouted Alice.

510
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,660
'We are here!'

511
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,600
But Munro did not hear them.

512
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,660
He did not stop.

513
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,780
Magua was watching.

514
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,590
He ran to Cora.

515
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,900
'Will you come with me now?' he said.

516
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,420
'Never!' said Cora.

517
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,130
'I will not be your wife.'

518
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,110
The Huron looked at her.

519
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,390
But he did not speak.

520
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,250
Then he turned to Alice.

521
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,010
He held Alice's arms.

522
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,600
He pulled her towards a horse.

523
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
'Stop!'

524
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,720
shouted Cora.

525
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,510
And she ran after them.

526
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,100
Magua put Alice on the horse.

527
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,860
Then he put Cora on the horse too.

528
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:49,820
The Huron took them along a path towards Lake
Horican.

529
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,200
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Trail

530
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,130
Three days had passed.

531
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,010
Fort William Henry had burnt down.

532
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,490
The French soldiers had gone.

533
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,750
The Indians had gone.

534
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:12,520
The bodies of many English soldiers, women
and children lay on the ground.

535
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,100
In the evening, five men walked through the
forest.

536
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:24,200
Munro, Duncan, Hawk-eye, Chingachgook and
Uncas were looking for Cora and Alice.

537
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,110
They found the dead bodies of many English
people.

538
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,080
The five men were sad and angry.

539
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,840
Suddenly, Uncas shouted to the others, 'Look!'

540
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,470
He had a small piece of cloth in his hand.

541
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,540
'That is a piece of Cora's dress!' said Munro.

542
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,820
Uncas found footprints on the ground, near
a tree.

543
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,690
'Three people and a horse have stood here,'
he said.

544
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,990
Then Chingachgook found Alice's necklace.

545
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,710
And he found another piece of Cora's dress.

546
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,500
Duncan took the necklace.

547
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,570
He smiled.

548
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,800
'Alice is alive,' he said.

549
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,611
'Miss Cora has left a trail,' said Hawk-eye.

550
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,840
'She has left pieces of her dress.

551
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,260
We can follow this trail.

552
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,740
But we must go quietly.

553
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,870
Magua is with them.'

554
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,510
'But it is late,' said Hawk-eye.

555
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,120
'We will eat some food.

556
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,880
We will sleep here tonight.

557
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,640
Tomorrow we will follow Miss Cora's trail.'

558
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,490
Very early the next morning, Hawk-eye woke
the English officers and the Mohicans.

559
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,750
The five men followed Cora's trail.

560
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,690
It led them to Lake Horican.

561
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:51,020
Uncas and Chingachgook found a canoe in the
grass near the lake.

562
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,000
The five men got into the canoe.

563
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,810
The Mohicans paddled it along the lake.

564
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,490
After half an hour, Uncas spoke quietly.

565
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,740
'Smoke,' he said.

566
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,400
He was looking at a small island in front
of them.

567
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,900
'Smoke from a fire,' said Hawk-eye.

568
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,370
'And there are two canoes.'

569
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:17,130
Suddenly, some Hurons ran from the trees on
the island.

570
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,740
They got into the two canoes.

571
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,870
'They are following us,' said Duncan.

572
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,040
'Paddle faster!'

573
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
'No!

574
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,520
Stop paddling, Chingachgook,' said Hawk-eye.

575
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,770
'I will shoot them.'

576
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,240
And he lifted his long gun.

577
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,820
He fired.

578
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,490
A Huron in the first canoe fell into the lake.

579
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,260
The Hurons stopped their two canoes.

580
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,970
They did not follow.

581
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:46,850
Chingachgook and Uncas started paddling again.

582
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,080
The five men went on.

583
00:34:49,080 --> 00:35:03,240
They went north, up the lake.

584
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,660
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Medicine Man

585
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:13,720
In the evening, the five men arrived at the
north end of Lake Horican.

586
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,830
They got out of the canoe and Uncas and Chingachgook
carried it.

587
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,710
They put it under some trees.

588
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,330
'We have lost the trail,' said Duncan.

589
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,350
'Where shall we go?'

590
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:31,080
'My Mohican friends know the path to the Hurons'
village,' said Hawk-eye.

591
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,930
'It is north of this place.

592
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,130
That is where Magua is going.

593
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,880
We will go north too.'

594
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,270
For two days, the men followed the path.

595
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,010
They walked many miles.

596
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,110
They arrived at the Hurons' village on the
second day.

597
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,360
It was early evening.

598
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,300
There were about a hundred houses by a small
lake.

599
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,560
Hawk-eye spoke to Chingachgook and Uncas.

600
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,310
Then he spoke to Duncan and Munro.

601
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,520
'General Munro, stay with Chingachgook,' said
Hawk-eye.

602
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,830
'Stay in the forest.

603
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,520
Duncan and I will go into the village.

604
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,230
Uncas, go up the hill to the west.

605
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,030
Watch the village.

606
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,780
Come back quickly.

607
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,680
Tell us about the guards.'

608
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,630
An hour passed.

609
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,450
The four men waited.

610
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,950
Uncas did not come back.

611
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,230
Suddenly Duncan spoke.

612
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,570
'I have a plan,' he said.

613
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,120
'Hawk-eye, give me your coat.

614
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,510
I must not wear my red soldier's coat in the
village.

615
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,160
I will be a medicine man - a French doctor.

616
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,300
I will speak French.

617
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,770
I will walk through the village and go into
the houses.

618
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,470
The Hurons will not hurt a medicine man.

619
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:06,020
I will find Alice and Cora.'

620
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,880
It was a dangerous plan.

621
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,290
Duncan put on Hawk-eye's coat.

622
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,900
Then he walked into the Hurons' village.

623
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,340
There was a large wooden building in front
of him.

624
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,190
It was the meeting-house of the Huron chiefs.

625
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,110
Duncan went inside.

626
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,800
Some Huron chiefs were sitting together.

627
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,580
They saw Duncan come in.

628
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,390
One of the chiefs walked forward.

629
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:39,910
His hair was grey and he was tall and strong.

630
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,980
He spoke to Duncan in the Huron language.

631
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,510
But Duncan did not understand.

632
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,360
'Do you speak French?'

633
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,960
Duncan asked.

634
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,190
The Huron replied in French.

635
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,070
'Why are you here?' he asked.

636
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,730
'I am a medicine man,' said Duncan.

637
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,770
'The King of France sent me.

638
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,230
Are any Hurons ill?'

639
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,100
Suddenly, there were loud cries from the forest.

640
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,490
The chiefs left the meeting-house.

641
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,140
Duncan followed them.

642
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,870
More Hurons were coming into the village.

643
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,650
There was a prisoner in front of them.

644
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:35,400
It was Uncas!

645
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,930
CHAPTER NINE
In the Hurons' Village

646
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,500
Uncas was not afraid.

647
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,850
The Hurons ran around him.

648
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,180
They shouted.

649
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,670
They pulled him towards the wooden building.

650
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,350
Uncas saw Duncan outside the building.

651
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:59,020
'Hawk-eye is safe, Uncas,' Duncan said quietly.

652
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,070
Then the Hurons took Uncas into the meeting-house.

653
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,570
Duncan walked through the village.

654
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,980
He looked in the houses.

655
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,060
Nobody stopped him.

656
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,480
Nobody asked any questions.

657
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,000
But Duncan did not find Alice and Cora.

658
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,460
He went back to the meeting-house.

659
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,610
He went inside.

660
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,850
Uncas was standing and the chiefs were sitting.

661
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,290
Duncan sat down too.

662
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,860
He sat near the wall.

663
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,960
Then another Huron came into the building.

664
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,370
It was Magua!

665
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,280
Magua did not see Duncan.

666
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,220
But he saw Uncas.

667
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,410
He shouted, 'Mohican, you must die!'

668
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,650
Magua was angry.

669
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,050
He turned to the chiefs.

670
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,910
'Many Hurons died at Glenn's Falls,' he said.

671
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,130
'This Mohican is our enemy!'

672
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:06,980
Magua and two Hurons took the young Mohican
out of the meeting-house.

673
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,960
Then one of the chiefs spoke to Duncan.

674
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,510
'Medicine man, the wife of one of my men is
ill - she is sick.

675
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,630
Can you make her well?'

676
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,320
'Take me to the woman,' said Duncan.

677
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,470
He followed the chief out of the meeting-house.

678
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,630
They went towards a hill.

679
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,910
There was a cave in the hill.

680
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,590
Duncan saw a bear following them.

681
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,870
But he was not afraid.

682
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,820
Indians liked bears.

683
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,770
They often had bears in their villages.

684
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,100
Duncan followed the chief into the cave.

685
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:56,430
The cave was large and there were many rooms
with stone walls.

686
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,620
The chief took Duncan into one room.

687
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,100
The sick woman was lying on the ground.

688
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,860
Some other women were with her.

689
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,980
Duncan looked at the sick woman.

690
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,490
'She is dying,' he thought.

691
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:20,260
The Huron chief waited and looked at Duncan.

692
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,400
Duncan turned to the Huron chief.

693
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,100
'I must look at this sick woman alone,' he
said.

694
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,790
'My medicine is secret.

695
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,360
Go with these four women.

696
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,160
Wait outside.'

697
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,660
The chief and the four women left the cave.

698
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,970
A few minutes later, the bear came into the
cave.

699
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,780
The bear made a loud noise.

700
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,800
Duncan looked at the bear.

701
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,440
Again, the bear made a loud noise.

702
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,790
It walked towards Duncan.

703
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,810
Suddenly, it took off its head!

704
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,850
It was Hawk-eye!

705
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,900
Hawk-eye was wearing a bear's skin!

706
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,100
'What-?' said Duncan.

707
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,300
Then he laughed.

708
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,530
'Why are you wearing a bear's skin?' he asked.

709
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,660
'I found the bear's skin in a Huron's house,'
said Hawk-eye.

710
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,570
'Now the Hurons will not stop me.

711
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,570
But tell me.

712
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,280
Where is Miss Alice?'

713
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,430
'I have been unlucky.

714
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,080
I have not found Alice or Cora.

715
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,630
And Uncas is a prisoner of the Hurons.'

716
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,240
'Magua has taken Miss Cora to the village
of the Delawares,' said Hawk-eye.

717
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,800
'I heard two Hurons talking about her.

718
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,410
Chingachgook and Munro are safe in the forest.'

719
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,800
Then Hawk-eye heard a noise.

720
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,710
He looked over a stone wall.

721
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,570
'Miss Alice is in the next room!' he said.

722
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,160
Duncan went into the next room.

723
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,830
There were some blankets, cloths and animals'
skins in the room.

724
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,410
And there was Alice.

725
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,620
Her hands and feet were tied with rope.

726
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,830
Her face was white.

727
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,050
She was afraid.

728
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,290
'Duncan!'

729
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,310
she said.

730
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,890
'You are here.'

731
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,850
'Yes,' said Duncan.

732
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,190
He untied her hands and feet.

733
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,020
'Where is Cora?' asked Alice.

734
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,260
'Where is my father?'

735
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,650
'Your father is safe.

736
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,130
He is with Chingachgook,' said Duncan.

737
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,360
'And Cora?'

738
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,220
Alice asked again.

739
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,750
'She is near here.

740
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,320
She is at another village,' said Duncan.

741
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,480
'She is with the Delawares.'

742
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,900
Suddenly, somebody came into the room.

743
00:43:49,900 --> 00:44:12,300
It was Magua!

744
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,640
CHAPTER TEN
The Bear

745
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,370
Magua looked at Duncan and Alice.

746
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,020
He laughed and went towards them.

747
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,730
Suddenly the bear was in the room.

748
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,890
It quickly held Magua.

749
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,110
Magua could not move.

750
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,940
He could not turn round.

751
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
Duncan ran to the Huron.

752
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,640
He tied Magua's arms.

753
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,750
Then he tied Magua's feet.

754
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:47,260
Magua started to speak, but Duncan put a cloth
into his mouth.

755
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,280
Hawk-eye took off the bear's head.

756
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,250
'We must go quickly,' he said.

757
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,190
'Alice, you will wear a blanket.

758
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,620
You will be the sick Huron woman.

759
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,160
Then you can leave the Hurons' village.'

760
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,490
Hawk-eye put on the bear's head again.

761
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:08,680
Alice put a blanket over her head.

762
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,260
Duncan carried Alice out of the cave.

763
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,780
And Hawk-eye followed Duncan.

764
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,670
The Huron chief was outside the cave.

765
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,180
'I am taking the sick woman away,' said Duncan.

766
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,820
'I will bring her to your house tomorrow.'

767
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:32,380
Hawk-eye, Duncan and Alice left the village.

768
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,960
Then Hawk-eye led Duncan and Alice to a path.

769
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,700
'This path goes to a small river,' Hawk-eye
said to them.

770
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,980
'You will see a hill.

771
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,030
The village of the Delawares is near the hill.

772
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,590
You will be safe with the Delawares.'

773
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,350
'What are you going to do?' asked Duncan.

774
00:45:54,350 --> 00:46:00,930
'I must go back for Uncas,' said Hawk-eye.

775
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,120
It was dark in the village.

776
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,300
The Hurons were in their houses.

777
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,160
They were asleep.

778
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,760
Hawk-eye was looking for Uncas.

779
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,480
The scout was wearing the bear's skin.

780
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,200
He looked in all the buildings.

781
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,530
Then he saw two men outside a house.

782
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,370
They were guards.

783
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,280
But they were asleep.

784
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,870
Hawk-eye quietly went inside the house.

785
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,310
Uncas was lying on the floor.

786
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:36,340
His hands and feet were tied with rope.

787
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,220
Hawk-eye took off the bear's head.

788
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,410
Uncas smiled.

789
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:46,360
'Hawk-eye,' he said quietly.

790
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,160
Hawk-eye untied Uncas' hands and feet.

791
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,680
Then he took off the bear's skin.

792
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,250
Uncas and Hawk-eye ran quickly from the village.

793
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,890
'We shall go to the Delawares' village,' said
Hawk- eye.

794
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,360
'Yes!' said Uncas.

795
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,070
'The Delawares are the children of my grandfather.

796
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,580
They will help us.'

797
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,930
The next morning, the Hurons went to get Uncas.

798
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,010
They were going to kill him.

799
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,860
They found the bear's skin.

800
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,190
But they did not find the Mohican.

801
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,360
Then they went to the cave.

802
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,900
They found a dead woman.

803
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,640
But they did not find Alice.

804
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,260
They found Magua.

805
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,700
His hands and feet were tied.

806
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,710
A cloth was in his mouth.

807
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,240
The Hurons untied Magua's hands and feet.

808
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,450
They took the cloth from his mouth.

809
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,770
Magua was angry.

810
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:50,060
'Kill the Mohican prisoner now!' he shouted.

811
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,210
'He has gone,' said one of the chiefs.

812
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,321
Magua shouted with anger.

813
00:47:54,321 --> 00:48:04,610
And he ran out of the cave.

814
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:10,540
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Old Chief

815
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,700
Magua went to the Delawares' village.

816
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,820
The Delawares were friends of France.

817
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,470
But they did not fight in the war.

818
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,350
Magua went to the Delawares' meeting-house.

819
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,810
The Delaware chiefs were talking.

820
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,890
'The Huron chief is welcome,' said a Delaware.

821
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,350
'Is my woman prisoner safe and well?' asked
Magua.

822
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,930
'She is well,' said the Delaware.

823
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:40,700
Then Magua said, 'Are there strangers in the
forest?

824
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,900
White men?'

825
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:46,040
'There are strangers in the village,' said
the Delaware.

826
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,790
'They are in my house.

827
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,730
But strangers are always welcome in this village.'

828
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,650
'What will the King of France say about this?'
said Magua.

829
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,640
'His greatest enemy is here in the Delawares'
village.

830
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,500
This enemy is a white man.

831
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,119
He kills many friends of the French.'

832
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,520
'Which white man is an enemy of France?' asked
the Delaware chief.

833
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,190
'The scout, Hawk-eye!' said Magua.

834
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,070
'The Long Gun!

835
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,220
The other strangers are his friends.

836
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,550
They are the enemies of France too.'

837
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,970
The Delawares started to talk quietly.

838
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,200
One of them left the meeting-house quickly.

839
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,910
A few minutes later, he came back.

840
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,550
Then a very old man came into the meeting-house.

841
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:46,520
Two young Delawares helped the old man.

842
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:52,360
He had long white hair and there were many
lines on his face.

843
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,190
The chiefs spoke his name - 'Tamenund.'

844
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,920
Magua knew the name of this famous Delaware
chief.

845
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,670
Tamenund was more than one hundred years old!

846
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,270
Tamenund sat down.

847
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,500
Then he spoke to the two young Delawares.

848
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,480
They got up and went away.

849
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:22,160
Soon, they came back with Alice, Cora, Duncan
and Hawk-eye.

850
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,790
Cora was very angry.

851
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:26,360
She spoke to the chiefs.

852
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,170
'Yesterday, we were welcome in this village,'
she said.

853
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,220
'The Delawares were our friends.

854
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,300
Today we are your prisoners.

855
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,480
Why are we prisoners?'

856
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,700
Tamenund did not answer.

857
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:49,410
'Which man is Hawk-eye, The Long Gun?' he
asked.

858
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,200
Hawk-eye walked forward.

859
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,980
'I am Hawk-eye,' he said.

860
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,369
Then Tamenund spoke quickly to Magua.

861
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:00,480
'Take your prisoner - the dark-haired woman.

862
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,070
Go!' he said.

863
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,810
But Cora spoke to the old chief.

864
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,160
'Another man came to this village with us,'
she said.

865
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,180
'Now he is a prisoner too.

866
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,220
But he is one of your own people.

867
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,720
He will tell our story.

868
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,910
Please!

869
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,110
Listen to him!'

870
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,250
Tamenund looked at the chiefs.

871
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,710
'Who is this other prisoner?' he asked.

872
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,790
'He fights for the English,' Magua said quickly.

873
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,001
'You must kill him.'

874
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:37,830
'Bring him here!' said Tamenund.

875
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,400
Two men left the meeting-house.

876
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:47,360
Soon they came back with Uncas.

877
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,630
Uncas was not wearing a shirt.

878
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,270
His hands were tied.

879
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,990
He stood in front of Tamenund.

880
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,680
The old chief looked at him.

881
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,120
Tamenund saw a tattoo on Uncas' chest.

882
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:13,520
It was a picture 

883
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:24,600
of a turtle.

884
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,970
Tamenund looked at Uncas.

885
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,540
Then he smiled at the young Mohican.

886
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:35,790
'Your father is a great chief,' he said.

887
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,570
Uncas suddenly saw Hawk-eye.

888
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,660
'Delaware Father,' he said to Tamenund.

889
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,860
'This is my friend, Hawk-eye.

890
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,890
He is a friend of the Delawares.'

891
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,560
'The Long Gun?' said Tamenund.

892
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,400
'He is not a friend of the Delawares.

893
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,980
He kills our young men.'

894
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,590
Then Hawk-eye spoke.

895
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,460
'I kill Hurons,' he said.

896
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,490
'I have never killed a Delaware.'

897
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:11,110
The Delawares believed Hawk-eye's words.

898
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,830
Tamenund looked at Uncas.

899
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:18,570
'Why are you the Huron's prisoner?' he asked.

900
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:23,150
'I helped the English woman,' said Uncas.

901
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,990
Tamenund looked at Cora.

902
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:28,660
Then he spoke to Magua.

903
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:34,250
'And why is the English woman your prisoner?'
he asked.

904
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,030
'I hate the English!' said Magua.

905
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:42,400
'Now the daughter of an English chief is my
prisoner.

906
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,110
Now the daughter of Munro will be my wife.'

907
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,110
Magua went to Cora and held her arm.

908
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,130
'Wait!' shouted Duncan.

909
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,330
'Don't take her.

910
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:58,230
The English will give you money.'

911
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,440
But Magua did not listen.

912
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,010
He pulled Cora towards the door.

913
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:05,210
'Come!' he said to her.

914
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,510
'I am your prisoner,' Cora said to Magua.

915
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,990
'But do not touch me.'

916
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,619
She turned to Duncan.

917
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:18,280
'Please take care of my young sister,' she
said.

918
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,440
She kissed Alice.

919
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,420
Then she spoke to Magua.

920
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,900
'I will come with you.'

921
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,930
'And I will come too!'

922
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,930
shouted Duncan.

923
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,620
'I will help you, Cora!'

924
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,890
'Wait!' said Hawk-eye.

925
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,330
He held Duncan's arm.

926
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,490
Hawk-eye spoke quickly and quietly.

927
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,590
'Magua's friends are waiting in the forest,'
he said.

928
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,850
'They will kill you.'

929
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,830
'Huron!' said Uncas.

930
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,010
'We will find you!

931
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,450
We will kill you!'

932
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,170
But Magua laughed.

933
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,370
'Mohican,' said Magua.

934
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,670
'you cannot kill me.

935
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,710
I am too strong.

936
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,510
Stay here with your brothers, the Delawares.

937
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,210
They are weak.

938
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,390
They like their homes and their food.

939
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,570
They do not like fighting.

940
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,650
They will not help you.'

941
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:17,060
Then Magua walked out of the meeting-house.

942
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,800
Cora followed him.

943
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,119
Uncas spoke to Tamenund.

944
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,910
'Delaware Father,' he said.

945
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,310
'Help us.

946
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,480
We must follow the English woman.'

947
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,270
Tamenund called the young men of the village.

948
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,940
'Go with the Mohican,' he said.

949
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:54,230
'The Hurons are now our enemies!'

950
00:55:54,230 --> 00:56:00,450
CHAPTER TWELVE
The Last of the Mohicans

951
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:04,150
Magua and Cora walked into the forest.

952
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:08,000
They walked towards the Hurons' village.

953
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,320
An hour later, Hawk-eye, Duncan and Uncas
followed Magua's trail.

954
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,440
Two hundred young Delawares went with the
three friends.

955
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,900
Alice stayed in the Delawares' village.

956
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,630
Hawk-eye spoke to Uncas.

957
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:30,160
'Major Heyward and I will find Chingachgook
and General Munro,' he said.

958
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,170
'They are safe in the forest.

959
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,210
Uncas, take the Delawares with you.

960
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,010
Follow Magua's trail.

961
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,330
Be careful!

962
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,950
There will be many Hurons in the forest.

963
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:47,119
We will meet you at the Hurons' village.'

964
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,369
'Magua will take Cora to the cave in the hill,'
said Hawk-eye.

965
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,970
'We will find her!

966
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,890
We will help her!'

967
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:59,290
'Come,' said Duncan.

968
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,310
Hawk-eye and Duncan soon found Chingachgook
and Munro.

969
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,910
They quickly told Munro their story.

970
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:10,560
Then the four men went to the Hurons' village.

971
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,830
They walked up the hill towards the cave.

972
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:20,100
Suddenly, they heard shouts and cries.

973
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,400
They looked down at the village.

974
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,710
Uncas and the Delawares were fighting the
Hurons in the village.

975
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,590
Then Magua and some Hurons ran up the hill.

976
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,020
They were going to the cave.

977
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,430
Uncas was running after them.

978
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,609
Hawk-eye and his friends fought the Hurons.

979
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:42,100
The fight was terrible, but Magua escaped.

980
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:50,270
Then Hawk-eye, Duncan, Munro, the Mohicans
and their friends saw Magua again.

981
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,750
He was with another Huron.

982
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,270
They were in front of the cave.

983
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,210
The two Indians were pulling Cora from the
cave.

984
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,330
'Cora!'

985
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,330
shouted Duncan.

986
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,190
'There is Cora!'

987
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:07,100
Uncas ran towards the rocks above the cave.

988
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,060
Cora had stopped in front of the cave.

989
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,950
Magua took out his knife.

990
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,160
He turned to Cora.

991
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,840
'Woman!' he shouted.

992
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,980
'Will you be the wife of Magua?

993
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,950
Or will you die?'

994
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,460
'Kill me, Magua!'

995
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,460
Cora said.

996
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,640
'I will not go with you!'

997
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,180
Suddenly there was a cry.

998
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,040
Uncas was standing on the rocks above them.

999
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,290
Magua looked up.

1000
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,600
The other Huron turned to Cora.

1001
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,690
He stabbed her with his knife and killed her.

1002
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,180
Magua shouted angrily.

1003
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,710
He lifted his knife and killed the Huron.

1004
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,210
Then Uncas jumped on Magua.

1005
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,620
They fought.

1006
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,410
But Magua turned quickly.

1007
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,600
He stabbed Uncas four times.

1008
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,480
The young Mohican stood for a moment.

1009
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,220
Then he fell at Magua's feet - dead.

1010
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,170
Hawk-eye saw Uncas fall.

1011
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,980
The scout ran towards Magua.

1012
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,940
Magua ran up the path.

1013
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,630
His enemies were below him.

1014
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,630
Magua climbed up the rocks.

1015
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,530
Then he turned and looked down.

1016
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,020
Hawk-eye stopped running.

1017
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,580
He lifted his long gun.

1018
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,360
Magua jumped towards a higher rock and Hawk-eye
fired.

1019
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,100
Magua's fingers touched the rock.

1020
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,900
But the bullet from Hawk-eye's gun killed
him.

1021
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:38,360
And his body fell down and down onto the rocks.

1022
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:50,160
A day later, General Munro, Duncan and Alice
stood by the graves of Uncas and Cora.

1023
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,420
They were sad and silent.

1024
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,590
Then they said goodbye to Hawk-eye, Chingachgook,
and the Delawares.

1025
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,650
And they walked away into the forest.

1026
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,460
Chingachgook looked at Hawk-eye.

1027
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:10,660
'All the people of my tribe have gone now,'
he said.

1028
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,510
'I am alone.'

1029
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,940
'No,' said Hawk-eye.

1030
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,380
'Uncas has gone.

1031
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,790
But you are not alone.'

1032
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:25,180
He put his hand on Chingachgook's hand.

1033
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:36,530
The tears of the two friends fell onto the
grave of Uncas.

1034
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:41,320
In 1758, General Munro died.

1035
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:46,290
Alice married Duncan Heyward and they lived
happily together.

1036
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:52,590
From that time, the Delawares told their children
the story of the English woman and the young

1037
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,240
Mohican.

1038
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,440
And they told their children the words of
Tamenund, the old chief:

1039
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:03,580
'The time of the red man has gone.

1040
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:07,200
We fought for our land.

1041
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:15,200
But now there are many white men - as many
as the leaves on the trees.

1042
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,840
I have lived too long.

1043
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:44,840
I have seen 

1044
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:52,030
the last of the Mohicans!'

1045
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:54,850
- THE END -
