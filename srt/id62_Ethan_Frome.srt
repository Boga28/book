00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,489
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:05,209
Beginnings

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:13,019
If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you
know the post office there. If you know the

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:22,580
post office, you have probably seen Ethan
Frome driving up to it in his buggy, and you

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,910
have probably wondered who he was.

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:37,839
It was there that, several years ago, I saw
him for the first time. He was a noticeable

7
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:47,920
figure. His tall, strong body was badly twisted,
and much shorter on the right side than on

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:58,800
the left. He moved slowly and painfully, pulling
himself along. Just the few steps from his

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:10,641
buggy to the post office were clearly difficult
for him. His face had a sad, grim look. It

10
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:22,560
was the face and body of an old man, and I
was surprised to hear that he was only fifty-two.

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:32,270
I learnt this from Harmon Gow, a man who knew
all the families around Starkfield.

12
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:41,620
'He's been like that since his bad accident,
nearly twenty-four years ago,' said Harmon.

13
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:50,710
'But Fromes don't die young. Ethan'll live
to a hundred, probably.'

14
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,590
'He looks like a dead man already,' I said.

15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:05,630
'I guess he's been in Starkfield too many
winters,' said Harmon. 'Most smart people

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,780
get out of here.'

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,239
'Why didn't he get out?' I asked.

18
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:21,719
'He had to stay and take care of his family
- first his father got hurt, then his mother

19
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,590
fell sick, then his wife.'

20
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,819
'And then the accident?'

21
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:39,019
Harmon gave a little smile. 'That's right.
He had to stay then.'

22
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:48,159
Ethan Frome used to drive in from his farm
every day at about midday, and because I picked

23
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:57,940
up my mail at about the same time, I often
saw him. He came to the post office only for

24
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:09,099
a newspaper, and sometimes for a packet from
a medicine company for 'Mrs Zeena Frome'.

25
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:17,529
Starkfield people understood that he did not
want to stop and talk, and on most days Frome

26
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:27,999
climbed slowly back into his buggy and drove
away without a word to anyone.

27
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:37,389
At that time, my company had sent me on an
engineering job near Starkfield, and I was

28
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:46,769
staying at the home of a lady called Mrs Ruth
Hale. Before she was married, her name had

29
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:56,969
been Ruth Varnum, but her husband Ned Hale
was now dead, and she had returned to live

30
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:07,309
with her mother in the Varnum home. It was
a grand house, large and white, with tall

31
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:17,090
dark trees outside. Although it was clear
that the Varnums no longer had much money,

32
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,860
theirs was still the finest house in the village.

33
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:32,090
Ruth Hale enjoyed talking about her neighbours,
and I hoped that she could tell me more about

34
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:42,699
Ethan Frome. But when I asked her, she just
looked unhappy and said in a low voice:

35
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:49,480
'Yes, I knew them both... it was awful...

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:05:00,759
I asked other people, and everybody in Starkfield
agreed that Ethan Frome had had more troubles

37
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:13,520
in his life than most people. But nobody explained
why he had that sad, grim took on his face,

38
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:24,980
in the end, I learnt the story, piece by piece,
from several people. As often happens, the

39
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:34,610
story was different each time, but I slowly
began to put it together. And my interest

40
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:45,470
in Ethan Frome grew stronger when - a little
later - I met the man himself.

41
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:54,690
It happened like this. Every day I had to
travel about three miles to the station, where

42
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:06,580
I got my train to work, I usually hired a
horse from Denis Eady, the rich village shopkeeper.

43
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:15,630
But in the middle of winter, his and most
of the other Starkfield horses caught an illness.

44
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:26,180
For a day or two, I could not find a horse
to hire anywhere, until Harmon Gow had an

45
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,470
idea.

46
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:36,439
'Why don't you ask Ethan Frome to drive you?'
he said. 'His horse ain't sick, and he needs

47
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:47,240
a dollar or two. That Frame farm and sawmill
don't make enough money to keep a cat alive.'

48
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:57,060
So Ethan Frome agreed to drive me, and every
day for a week I sat beside him in his sleigh

49
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:07,460
as his thin horse pulled us over the hard
snow to the station. Then, in the icy evenings,

50
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,780
he brought me back to Starkfield.

51
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:20,840
He was not unfriendly, but during the hour's
drive, he never turned to look at me, and

52
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:32,770
spoke very little. Once I said something about
Florida and he told me that he had been there.

53
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:40,039
Another time he showed interest in a science
book of mine, which I had left in his sleigh

54
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:49,500
by mistake in the morning. But most of the
time Frome drove without a word, and I began

55
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:59,039
to feel that he was like the land around him.
This sad, silent man and the snow-covered

56
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:09,979
fields had the same kind of cold loneliness.
Anything warm and alive inside him was locked

57
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:19,430
away, under the deep icy cold of too many
Starkfield winters.

58
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:27,849
After about a week, we were driving back one
night in terrible weather. Heavy snow was

59
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:37,669
falling, hiding everything in a soft white
cloud, and the air had an icy coldness. The

60
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:45,730
old horse was getting tired, and I got out
to walk beside him, but I found it hard to

61
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,020
keep moving.

62
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:57,950
After a time Frome looked into the darkness
and said: 'That's my place down there. We've

63
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,389
had enough of this.'

64
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:08,610
I understood that he was offering me a bed
for the night, and we turned down towards

65
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:17,910
the poor, lonely-looking farmhouse. After
I had helped him put away the sleigh and take

66
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:26,820
care of the horse, we fought our way through
the snow to the front of the house. I followed

67
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:36,680
him inside, and from behind a door on our
right, I heard a woman's voice, a thin, high,

68
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,639
whining voice.

69
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:48,260
Frome opened the door of the room. 'Come in,'
he said to me, and as he spoke, the whining

70
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,580
voice fell silent.

71
00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:16,350
That was the night when I began to understand
Ethan Frome, and to put together his story...

72
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,010
CHAPTER TWO

73
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,019
Coming home from the dance

74
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:33,110
It was a cold, clear night, and the village
lay under deep snow. Bright, icy stars shone

75
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,860
from a dark sky down on the silent whiteness
below.

76
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:48,460
Young Ethan Frome walked quickly down the
empty, moonlit street. He passed Eady's fine

77
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:58,649
new shop and the Varnums' house with its two
tall black trees. Below that was the slope

78
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:08,480
of the Corbury road. On clear nights, this
was often full of young people coasting down,

79
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,850
laughing and shouting as they went. But there
was not a sound from the icy slope as Ethan

80
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:28,269
passed by. Tonight all Starkfield's life was
in a room in the church. Its windows sent

81
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:37,029
yellow light across the snow, and the sound
of dance music flowed out into the still midnight

82
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:46,279
air. Ethan hid in the shadows outside the
church, and looked in through the nearest

83
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,829
window.

84
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:58,079
The room was hot, bright, and filled with
young men and girls. The music had finished,

85
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:07,750
and people were getting ready to leave. Suddenly,
a lively young man with thick black hair jumped

86
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:17,530
into the middle of the floor. He went into
the crowd and pulled out a young girl. She

87
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:27,050
was dark-haired, and had a bright red scarf
around her head. The music started again,

88
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:34,440
and soon the floor was alive with dancing
figures.

89
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:43,370
Outside in the cold, Ethan's heart was beating
fast. His eyes followed the girl's red scarf

90
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:53,900
and cloud of brown hair as she danced in faster
and faster circles. The young, man was. Denis

91
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:03,600
Eady, the son of Starkfield's most successful
shopkeeper, Denis's own success with the young

92
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:13,190
women of the village was well known. Ethan
watched jealously as Mattie, the dark-haired

93
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:21,149
girl, held Eady's hands and smiled at him
with her dark, shining eyes.

94
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:29,830
'How can she look at him like that?' Ethan
wondered unhappily. 'Doesn't she realize what

95
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,910
he is like?'

96
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:40,550
Ethan used to walk into Starkfield to fetch
home his wife's cousin, Mattie Silver, on

97
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:48,470
the few evenings when some chance of amusement
brought her to the village. Mattie had been

98
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:56,850
with the Fromes for a year now. She lived
with them in their lonely farmhouse and helped

99
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:06,329
Ethan's wife, Zeena, with the housework. Ethan
had liked the warm, smiling girl from the

100
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:15,221
moment that she arrived. She brought hope
and life and brightness into his home, like

101
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:24,199
someone lighting a fire in a cold room. But
she had more than brightness; Ethan found

102
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:32,519
that she loved the beauty of the natural world
around them. Here at his side, living under

103
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:42,040
his roof and eating his bread, was someone
who felt the same wonder as he did. He could

104
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:50,350
tell her things and show her things - the
bright stars in the clear night sky, birds

105
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:59,550
flying over golden fields, the blue shadows
of trees on sunlit snow. And he knew that

106
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:09,310
these things gave Mattie and him the same
feelings of deep, silent happiness.

107
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:18,589
But now those feelings seemed so far away.
He watched Mattie's laughing face as she flew

108
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:27,930
round and round the room, and he felt lonely
and unhappy. Then he remembered a fear that

109
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:37,980
he had tried to forget. His wife was a cold,
silent woman who noticed everything but said

110
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:48,230
very little. Her only real interest was her
own ill health. But recently she had started

111
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:59,029
to complain more and more about Mattie's housework,
and to say things, which worried Ethan.

112
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:06,910
'I'll need someone to help me when Mattie
leaves,' she had said suddenly one morning.

113
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:15,190
'Oh, Mattie'll never leave us while you need
her,' he replied.

114
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:24,009
His wife lay in bed and watched, as he got
dressed. 'If a poor girl like her has a chance

115
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:33,310
to marry a smart boy like Denis Eady, I ain't
going to stop her,' she said in her flat,

116
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:44,759
whining voice. 'The doctor says I can't manage
on my own, so we'll need to hire a girl.'

117
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:54,730
Life without Mattie! Ethan could not think
of it. Her voice, her sweet smile, her gentle

118
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:02,730
arm in his arm during those night walks back
to the farm - these were the only things,

119
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:10,959
which mattered in his world. Had he been stupid
to think that Zeena would not notice his interest

120
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:20,270
in Mattie? He had not thought about it before,
but now, as he stood in the darkness outside

121
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:30,970
the church, he remembered other things that
Zeena had said, and his fear grew...

122
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:39,920
The dancers, now in their thick coats and
scarves, came out into the cold night air.

123
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:47,231
Ethan heard Mattie's voice in the crowd, and
he stepped back into the shadows, suddenly

124
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:56,230
afraid to speak to her. The crowd quickly
disappeared, and Mattie stood alone outside

125
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:03,049
the church, looking around her. Then a man's
figure appeared.

126
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:14,460
'Nobody to walk you home, Matt? What a pity!
But ain't I lucky that I got my dad's horse

127
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:24,590
and sleigh down here waiting for us? Come
on, let's take a ride!'

128
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:34,860
The girl said nothing, but stood still, watching,
while Denis Eady went to untie the horse.

129
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:44,809
In the shadows, Ethan too watched and waited,
with his heart beating fast. Mattie held his

130
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:54,730
life in her hands. Eady got into the sleigh
and called to Mattie to join him. Then she

131
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,850
turned and ran up the slope.

132
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:05,190
'Goodbye! Have a lovely ride!' she called
back.

133
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:12,700
Eady laughed and followed her up the slope
in his sleigh.

134
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:21,400
After a moment, he jumped down and tried to
put his arm through hers. She stepped quickly

135
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:31,210
out of the way, and Ethan's sudden fear turned
to happiness. A moment later, he heard the

136
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:42,320
sound of Eady's sleigh going away, and saw
Mattie walking alone across the snow.

137
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:50,390
He caught up with her by the Varnums' trees.
She turned round, surprised.

138
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:57,179
'Oh!' she said. 'I thought maybe you couldn't
come.'

139
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:07,200
'If you thought I couldn't come, why didn't
you ride back with Denis Eady?' he answered.

140
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:18,750
'Oh, how did you know?' she cried. 'Where
were you? I never saw you!'

141
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:26,559
They stood in the dark shadows of the trees,
and their laughing voices ran together like

142
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:36,179
water dancing down from the mountains in springtime.
He put his arm through hers, but neither of

143
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:46,500
them moved. Ethan wished he could stand there
with her all night in the blackness. Mattie

144
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:54,690
took a few steps forward and then stopped,
looking down the icy slope of the Corbury

145
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,010
road.

146
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:05,809
'There were lots of people coasting this evening,'
she said. 'Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum almost

147
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:13,660
crashed into the big tree- down there. It's
so dangerous, that tree.'

148
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:21,820
'You'd be safe with me, Matt,' replied Ethan.
'Would you like to come coasting some night?

149
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,720
We could come tomorrow if there's a moon.'

150
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,850
'Oh, yes. How lovely!'

151
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:38,880
They walked along in silence, but then all
Ethan's jealous fears returned.

152
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,380
'I guess it's natural that you're going to
leave us,' he said at last.

153
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:55,151
'Leave? You mean Zeena ain't happy with me?
I know I ain't so strong or so smart, but

154
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:59,230
I want to try, I really do.'

155
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,150
'So you don't want to leave us, Matt?'

156
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:11,430
'Where could I go?' she whispered, almost
crying.

157
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:20,220
Her answer made Ethan sad and happy at the
same time. They continued their walk, with

158
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:29,640
the dark, starry sky above them, and the quiet,
lonely fields all around. At the entrance

159
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:39,080
to Ethan's farmland they passed by the Frome
graves. Ethan had always felt that the gravestones

160
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:50,750
were looking at him and saying 'We never got
out of Starkfield. Why should you?' But now

161
00:22:50,750 --> 00:23:00,020
he didn't want to escape. All he wanted was
to be with Mattie, and some day to lie under

162
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:12,411
that cold ground with Mattie beside him. Ethan
was happy now, in his world of dreams. For

163
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:21,500
the first time he put his arm around Mattie.
She let it stay there, and they walked up

164
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,970
to the farmhouse.

165
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:34,539
The house was dark and quiet. Zeena always
went to bed early. On the nights when they

166
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:45,279
came back late, she used to Jock up the house
and hide the key outside the kitchen door.

167
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,320
Ethan felt for the key under the usual stone.

168
00:23:50,320 --> 00:24:01,260
'Matt, the key's not there!' he said. This
had never happened before. They began to look

169
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:10,809
for it in the darkness. Suddenly there was
a sound inside the house. They heard a step

170
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:23,309
on the stairs and saw light under the door.
Then the door opened, and Ethan saw his wife.

171
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:31,750
She stood in the dark doorway, a tall thin
woman with a blanket round her shoulders.

172
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:39,300
She held a lamp in one hand, and its light
threw strange shadows onto her thin lined

173
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:51,960
face. She said nothing, and they stepped into
the kitchen. It was deadly cold, like a grave.

174
00:24:51,960 --> 00:25:01,559
Ethan shook the snow off his boots. 'I guess
you forgot us,' he said, looking at Zeena.

175
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:07,510
'No. I just felt too bad. I couldn't sleep.'

176
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:14,620
'I'm sorry,' said Mattie, 'Can I do anything
to help, Zeena?'

177
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:23,870
'No, there's nothing you can do.' Zeena turned
away from her. 'And why couldn't you shake

178
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:31,070
that snow off outside?' she said to her husband.

179
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:40,080
They left the kitchen, and the two women went
towards the stairs. 'If I go up now, Mattie'll

180
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:50,400
see me go into the bedroom with Zeena,' thought
Ethan. 'And I don't want that, not tonight.'

181
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,860
'I think I'll stay down here a bit longer.
I've got some paperwork to do,' he said.

182
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:08,470
'What, now?' said Zeena. 'You'll die of cold.'

183
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:16,590
Ethan did not answer, but turned back towards
the kitchen. Then he saw the look in Mattie's

184
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,710
eyes. Was it a look of warning?

185
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:32,830
'I guess you're right. It is awful cold down
here,' he agreed. With his head down, he slowly

186
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:50,910
followed his wife up to their bedroom.

187
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,970
CHAPTER THREE

188
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,929
A visit to the doctor

189
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:05,330
The next morning was cold and bright. Ethan
was down at his sawmill early because he had

190
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:15,090
to take some wood to the village builder that
day. The winter sunburned red in a clear sky,

191
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:22,539
and the sunlight danced over the bright, snowy
fields, leaving deep blue shadows under the

192
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,640
trees.

193
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:34,010
Ethan's thoughts were always clearest when
he was working in the quiet morning air. Last

194
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:43,110
night, after the bedroom door had closed behind
them, Zeena had taken her medicine and gone

195
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:53,320
to bed without a word. Ethan lay next to her,
watching the light from under Mattie's door,

196
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:01,810
and thinking. Why had he not kissed her on
the walk home? He remembered her soft lips

197
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:11,600
in the moonlight. Now, in the clear morning
sunshine, he could still see her face. He

198
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,720
could see it in the red sky and in the bright
shining snow.

199
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,840
Mattie was the daughter of Orin Silver, a
cousin of Zeena Frome's. Silver's medicine

200
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:37,400
company had seemed successful, and he had
lived like a rich man. But when he died, his

201
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:45,900
wife and daughter had a terrible surprise.
They discovered that he had borrowed thousands

202
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:57,169
of dollars, which he could not pay back. This
awful news killed Mrs Silver immediately.

203
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:04,430
He had also lost money, which belonged to
his brothers and sisters, so there was nobody

204
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:13,429
in the family who wanted to help poor Mattie.
The twenty-year-old girl was alone in the

205
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:22,440
world, without money and without friends.
She was not strong, and she had never studied

206
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:31,429
or learnt to do a job. So Mattie came to Starkfield
to work, without pay, in her cousin Zeena's

207
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:41,000
home. At first Zeena often complained about
the girl's work. Then, as the months went

208
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,159
by, Mattie grew stronger and found the work
easier. Zeena had more time to think about

209
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:58,649
her illnesses, and life under the Fromes'
roof became more peaceful.

210
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:07,820
But now, Zeena's strange silent looks, the
warning in Mattie's eyes last night... Ethan

211
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:16,760
was sure that something was wrong. By midday,
the wood was all loaded, ready to take to

212
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:26,450
Andrew Hale the builder. But Ethan decided
to go home. If there was going to be trouble,

213
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:35,100
he wanted to be there. So Ethan and Jotham
Powell, his hired man, walked through the

214
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,610
fields back to the house.

215
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:48,120
When they entered the kitchen, Mattie was
making coffee. Zeena was sitting at the table,

216
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:56,290
wearing her best brown dress and a tall hat.
A suitcase stood beside her.

217
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:02,790
'Where're you going, Zeena?' asked Ethan,
surprised.

218
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:11,649
'My pains are getting really bad. I'm going
over to my aunt's in Bettsbridge for the night,

219
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:20,070
and tomorrow I'll see that new doctor,' she
answered. 'If you're too busy, I suppose you

220
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,980
can let Jotham Powell drive me to the station.'

221
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:33,600
Ethan said nothing. He was lost in his own
thoughts. He realized that, for the first

222
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:42,730
time, he and Mattie would be alone for the
night. He looked at Mattie. Was she thinking

223
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:53,260
the same thing? Then he looked at his wife's
thin, lined, bloodless face. Zeena was thirty-five,

224
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:00,800
only seven years older than he was, but she
was already an old woman.

225
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:09,510
'Of course Jorham'll take you,' he said at
last. 'I can't do it myself, because I've

226
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:15,300
got to get the money for the wood from Andrew
Hale.'

227
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:26,230
This was a lie. Andrew Hale never paid immediately,
but Ethan really had no wish to make the long,

228
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:33,880
slow journey to the station with his miserable
wife at his side.

229
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:43,000
Zeena made no reply, and soon afterwards,
she left with Jotham. Ethan picked up his

230
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:52,650
coat and stood for a moment in the doorway.
'See you later, Matt,' he said.

231
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:59,100
It was warm and bright: in the kitchen. The
sun shone in on the flowering pot plants by

232
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:07,679
the window, and the cat sleeping in a chair.
Mattie looked up from her housework. 'See

233
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,590
you later, Ethan,' she said happily.

234
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:21,360
All the way down to the village, Ethan thought
of his return to Mattie that night. Without

235
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:30,370
Zeena, his house seemed more like a home.
And as he drove through the snowy fields,

236
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:38,399
this usually silent man began to sing.

237
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:47,510
Ethan Frome had not always been so quiet and
lonely. As a student he had liked being among

238
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:56,299
happy, friendly, young people. He had enjoyed
his science studies and wanted to become an

239
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:05,720
engineer. But after his father's accident
and death, Ethan had to leave his studies

240
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:18,030
and return home. Life was hard for him, working
alone on the poor farm and unsuccessful sawmill.

241
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:26,110
Then his mother fell ill, and became more
and more silent. Sometimes she used to say

242
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:36,180
a few crazy words, but for most of the time,
she refused to speak at all. So with each

243
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:46,430
long, cold Starkfield winter, the silence
and loneliness round Ethan grew deeper.

244
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:53,920
As his mother came towards her last illness,
Ethan's cousin Zeena arrived to take care

245
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:03,120
of her. It was wonderful to hear another person's
voice in the house again, and Zeena was an

246
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:13,460
excellent nurse and housekeeper. Old Mrs Frome
finally died one dark winter's day, and the

247
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:22,700
idea of being alone again filled Ethan with
fear. He was grateful to Zeena for all that

248
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:32,450
she had done, and he asked her to stay and
marry him. They had at first planned to sell

249
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:42,260
the farm and move to the town. But it was
hard to find a buyer, and Ethan soon realized

250
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:51,370
that his wife could not live in a place where
she was not someone 'important'. In less than

251
00:35:51,370 --> 00:36:02,360
a year her 'sickliness' appeared; then she
too fell silent. Her strange, wordless looks

252
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:11,780
worried Ethan. Was she going a little crazy,
like his mother? What thoughts and plans were

253
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,820
hidden behind her cold eyes?

254
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,760
But that afternoon, as Ethan drove to the
village with his sleigh full of wood for the

255
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:31,700
builder, he felt less afraid. Zeena had gone
away to Bettsbridge, with all her thoughts

256
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:41,530
on her own health. And tonight he had an evening
alone with Mattie. But there was still one

257
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:49,540
worry - the lie about the money from Andrew
Hale. He knew that Zeena would want to know

258
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,110
where it was.

259
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:59,840
When Ethan arrived at the builder's, Hale
invited him into his office to sit down and

260
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:11,600
get warm. He was a large, red faced and likeable
man, an old friend of Ethan's family. Ethan

261
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:21,020
did not know how to begin, but at last, he
managed to ask Hale for the first fifty dollars

262
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:30,130
towards this winter's wood. The builder was
surprised. He always paid at the end of three

263
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:39,520
months, never before. He refused in his warm,
friendly way, and then asked:

264
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,980
'Look, you ain't got money problems, have,
you?'

265
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:52,660
'No, not at all,' replied Ethan, very embarrassed.

266
00:37:52,660 --> 00:38:01,130
The afternoon had turned into a cold grey
evening by the time Ethan left the builder's.

267
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:11,230
He heard the sound of sleigh-bells, and Denis
Eady drove past, shouting 'Hello, Ethe!' Eady

268
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:19,740
was going towards the Frome farm. Did he know
that Zeena had gone? Was he going there to

269
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:30,430
spend some time alone with Mattie? Ethan felt
wildly jealous, then moments later was ashamed

270
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,250
of his feelings.

271
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:41,590
By the Varnum house, Ethan saw two figures
standing together under the trees. He heard

272
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:51,960
a kiss, and a surprised 'Oh!' as he passed
by. Two happy lovers, kissing where he had

273
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:01,540
stood with Mattie the night before. But unlike
him, Ruth Varnum and Ned Hale didn't need

274
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:07,640
to hide their feelings. How lucky they were!

275
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:16,730
As night fell, Ethan passed by the Frome gravestones
and drove up to the farmhouse. A light shone

276
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,990
in a room upstairs.

277
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:38,910
'She's getting herself ready for supper,'
he thought.

278
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,000
CHAPTER FOUR

279
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,090
An evening together

280
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:54,100
Ethan went up to the kitchen door, and found
that it was locked. He called 'Hello, Matt!'

281
00:39:54,100 --> 00:40:03,130
but there was no answer. He stood in the darkness
and waited. After a moment, he heard a sound

282
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:13,640
on the stairs, and saw light round the door.
And just like the night before, the door opened

283
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:21,580
and there stood a woman with a lamp in her
hand. The lamplight shone on the milky whiteness

284
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:32,610
of Mattie's young skin, on her soft lips and
shining dark eyes. She smiled gently, and

285
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:37,000
stepped to the side to let Ethan come in.

286
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:47,580
The kitchen was warm and welcoming. On the
table were cakes and fruit in a bright red

287
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:55,500
glass dish, and the cat was lying lazily in
front of a warm fire.

288
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,870
'Well, Matt, any visitors?' asked Ethan.

289
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:11,180
'Just one,' replied Mattie, laughing. A black
cloud came down over Ethan's world.

290
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,640
'Who was that?'

291
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:22,070
She looked at him and laughed again. 'Jotham
Powell. He came in and asked for a drop of

292
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,740
coffee.'

293
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,210
The blackness lifted and Ethan's world grew
bright again.

294
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:40,350
'Well, I hope you gave him some,' he said,
then added, 'I suppose Zeena got to the station

295
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,140
in time?'

296
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:50,900
Zeena's name brought an immediate coolness
into the kitchen. After a few moments, Mattie

297
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:59,020
said: 'I guess it's about time for supper,'
and they sat down.

298
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:06,620
But they still felt uncomfortable - Zeena
seemed to be in the room with them, with her

299
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:18,860
cold eyes and strange looks. They ate in embarrassed
silence, then began to talk about the weather.

300
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:26,220
As they were speaking, the cat climbed quietly
onto the table and started to move towards

301
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:34,620
the milk-jug. When they saw it, they both
reached forwards at once, their hands meeting

302
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:44,100
on the jug. Ethan kept his hand on Mattie's
a few seconds longer than was necessary. At

303
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:53,460
that moment, the cat suddenly jumped backwards
and knocked into the red glass dish. The dish

304
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,650
fell to the floor with a crash.

305
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:08,080
'Oh, Ethan,' Mattie cried. 'It's all in pieces!
What will Zeena say? It was her very best

306
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,400
dish!'

307
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,160
'Don't worry. I'll get another one.'

308
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:22,970
'You'll never find one! It was a wedding present
from her aunt in Philadelphia. That's why

309
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:33,430
she never uses it. I had to climb up to get.it
from the top of her cupboard! Oh, Ethan, what

310
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,810
shall I do?'

311
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:42,730
She began to cry, and her tears seemed to
burn into Ethan's heart.'

312
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:53,250
'Oh, Matt, don't cry! Please don't cry!' he
said softly.

313
00:43:53,250 --> 00:44:00,880
They looked at the bits of red glass lying
like the broken pieces of their evening. Ethan

314
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:09,430
picked them up and walked out of the kitchen
to the hall. Reaching up his long arm, he

315
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:18,400
put the broken pieces at the top of the cupboard
and arranged them carefully. From below, nobody

316
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,550
could see that the dish was broken.

317
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:30,260
'I'll get some glue to mend it tomorrow,'
thought Ethan. 'Zeena won't look at it for

318
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:36,560
months, and I'm sure I'll find another one
somewhere.'

319
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:46,600
He went back to the kitchen. 'It's all right,
Matt,' he said. 'Let's finish supper.'

320
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:54,410
After the meal, Mattie cleared the table and
Ethan went out to see the cows. The world

321
00:44:54,410 --> 00:45:04,630
was dark and still outside. When he came back,
Mattie had pushed his chair near the fire

322
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:13,350
and had seated herself by the lamp with a
bit of sewing. He sat down, feeling warm and

323
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:21,690
dreamy and at peace with the world. The only
trouble was that he could not see Mattie from

324
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:32,200
where he sat. But he felt too lazy to move
and after a moment, he said: 'Come over here

325
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,960
and sit by the fire.'

326
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:45,460
Mattie got up and sat opposite him in Zeena's
rocking - chair. He looked at the chair and

327
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:53,740
for a moment, he saw his wife's grim face
there. Mattie seemed to feel uncomfortable

328
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:04,280
too. After a while she got up, saying, 'I
can't see to sew,' and went back to sit by

329
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,680
the lamp.

330
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:14,910
The cat jumped into the empty rocking - chair
and Ethan moved his own chair a little. Now

331
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:24,090
he could see Mattie as she sat and sewed in
the soft lamplight. A deep quiet came over

332
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:32,300
the kitchen. The 'tick-tick' of the clock
was the only sound in the room, and the smoke

333
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:40,800
from Ethan's pipe and the smell of Mattie's
flowering plants filled the air.

334
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:52,000
They began to talk easily of everyday things,
it all seemed so comfortable and so peaceful.

335
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,300
Ethan began to dream that they always spent
their evenings like this...

336
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:06,780
'This was the night when we were going coasting,
he said after a while.

337
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,450
She smiled back at him. 'I guess you forgot!'

338
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:21,860
'No, I didn't forget. It's too dark tonight,
but we can go tomorrow if there's a moon.'

339
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:31,860
'That would be lovely, Ethan!' Mattie laughed
happily, and her eyes shone in the lamplight.

340
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:38,820
Ethan loved the way that her face changed
as she talked, like a field of grass moving

341
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,780
under a gentle summer wind.

342
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:50,500
'It's too dangerous on a dark night like this,'
he went on. 'You've got to keep your eyes

343
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:59,030
open on that slope, you know, Matt. That's
a dangerous corner down by that big tree.

344
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:07,480
You could crash right into it if you're not
careful.' Then he added: 'I guess we're fine

345
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,910
here, aren't we?'

346
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:22,550
'Yes, we're fine here,' agreed Mattie in a
soft, sweet voice. Ethan put down his pipe

347
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:30,040
and pulled his chair up to the table. He touched
the end of her piece of sewing.

348
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:41,200
'Say, Matt, guess what I saw tonight? Your
friends kissing under the Varnum trees,' Mattie's

349
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:52,000
face turned bright red. 'That'll be Ruth and
Ned,' she answered, looking down at her sewing.

350
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,880
Ethan felt embarrassed too. Last night on
their walk home, he had put his arm around

351
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:10,170
Mattie, and had wanted to kiss her. But tonight,
in the warm lamp lit room, she seemed so much

352
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:13,200
further away.

353
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:20,980
'I guess they'll get married soon,' said Ethan.
'And then maybe you'll be next.'

354
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:30,160
'Why do you say that?' she replied in a low
voice. 'Is it because Zeena doesn't want me

355
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,380
to stay?'

356
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:37,860
'What do you mean?' asked Ethan, afraid again.

357
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:49,720
'I thought that last night she seemed... Oh,
I don't know. Nobody knows what Zeena thinks.

358
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,290
She hasn't said anything to you, has she?'

359
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,970
He shook his head. 'No, not a word.'

360
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:08,290
'I guess it was nothing then. Let's not think
about it,' said Mattie, and went on with her

361
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,400
sewing.

362
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,060
Ethan watched her in silence. Then he gently
took hold of the other end of her piece of

363
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:26,430
sewing. Mattie's warmth seemed to flow along
it towards him. Could she feel the answering

364
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:34,920
warmth from his own hand? They sat like this
for a few moments, then Ethan heard a sound

365
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:43,480
behind. The cat had jumped down from Zeena's
chair, and because of the sudden movement,

366
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,700
the empty chair had started a ghostly rocking.

367
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:57,540
'Zeena'll be in that chair herself this time
tomorrow,' thought Ethan. 'I've been in a

368
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:05,310
dream, and this is the only evening we'll
ever have together...' The return to the real

369
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:13,690
world filled him with pain, and he suddenly
felt very tired.

370
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:21,660
Mattie looked at him, and for a moment, he
saw fear cross her face. He held onto her

371
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:31,560
sewing and kissed the end of it softly. She
pulled it slowly from his lips and put it

372
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,490
away. It was eleven o'clock.

373
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:41,260
'Is the fire all right?' she asked in a low
voice.

374
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:48,080
They checked the fire, moved the plant pots
away from the cold window, and put out the

375
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,470
lamp.

376
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:57,500
'Goodnight, Matt,' he said, as she put her
foot on the first step of the stairs.

377
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:04,520
'Goodnight, Ethan,' she answered, and went
up.

378
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:26,440
When the door of her room had closed, he remembered
that he had not even touched her hand.

379
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,070
CHAPTER FIVE

380
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:32,060
Zeena's news

381
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:40,420
The next morning Jotham Powell came, round
early to help load some more wood. Ethan could

382
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:48,820
still feel inside him the sweetness of the
evening before, and he tried hard not to show

383
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,740
his happiness.

384
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:59,160
He did not know why he felt so happy. There
was no reason for it, because nothing had

385
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,460
changed in his life or in Mattie's.

386
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:12,580
But their evening together had given him a
dream a picture of life with Mattie at his

387
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,170
side.

388
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:21,990
He wanted to load the wood quickly and then
drive it down to Starkfield, where he could

389
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:30,850
buy the glue to mend the broken dish. He was
sending Jotham to fetch Zeena from the station

390
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:40,830
after dinner, so they needed to work fast.
But the morning went badly. A wet snow had

391
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:49,670
fallen in the night, and the roads were like
glass. One of his horses fell and cut its

392
00:53:49,670 --> 00:54:00,920
leg. Icy rain started to fall, making the
loading slow and difficult. It was after midday

393
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,270
when they finished.

394
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:11,930
Immediately after dinner, Ethan put his coat
on again. Jotham was drying his wet feet by

395
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:17,770
the fire and Mattie was washing the dishes.

396
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:25,920
'I'll be back early,' Ethan said to Mattie
in a low voice. He was afraid to say more

397
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,040
in front of Jotham, but he thought that Mattie
understood him.

398
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:41,170
The journey down to the village was long and
slow, with his two old horses pulling their

399
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:50,420
heavy load over the snow and ice underfoot.
By the time he had unloaded the wood and managed

400
00:54:50,420 --> 00:55:00,800
to buy the glue, it was already late afternoon.
On the way, back the rain began again, turning

401
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:11,001
to ice as it fell on the snow and making the
road even more glassy and dangerous. Once

402
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:19,240
or twice Ethan heard sleigh-bells and turned
round, afraid that Jotham and Zeena were coming

403
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:28,730
up behind him. But for most of the journey,
he just looked grimly into the falling rain,

404
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:35,280
as his tired horses made their way up the
hill.

405
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:43,110
At last, he arrived home and hurried into
the kitchen. Mattie was alone.

406
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:53,350
'Look, Matt,' he cried, 'I've got the glue
to mend the dish with! Quick, let me get it!'

407
00:55:53,350 --> 00:56:03,560
'Oh, Ethan - Zeena's back!' she said in a
whisper, holding onto his arm.

408
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:09,580
Ethan looked round the kitchen, which looked
cold and unwelcoming in the wintry evening

409
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,580
light.

410
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:16,200
'How is she?' he asked, in the same low whisper.

411
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:26,410
'I don't know. She didn't say anything, she
just went straight upstairs.'

412
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:35,050
Ethan put the glue back in his pocket. 'Don't
worry. I'll come down and mend the dish in

413
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,160
the night,' he said.

414
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:46,940
Then, just as she had done the evening before,
Mattie said: 'I guess it's about time for

415
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,180
supper.'

416
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:57,720
Ethan called Zeena, but there was no answer.
He went up to the bedroom, and pushed open

417
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:06,800
the door. In the darkness, he saw Zeena's
figure sitting by the window, still wearing

418
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,040
her travelling dress.

419
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,440
'Well, Zeena, supper's ready. Ain't you coming?'

420
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:24,830
'I don't think I could eat a thing,' she replied,
then turned her head towards him. 'I'm much

421
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,280
sicker than you think.'

422
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,250
'I hope that's not so, Zeena.'

423
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:39,810
'The doctor says I mustn't do anything at
all in the house. So we'll have to get a hired

424
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:40,850
girl.'

425
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,920
'A hired girl?'

426
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:52,690
'Yes. My aunt's found me one already. She's
coming tomorrow afternoon.'

427
00:57:52,690 --> 00:58:00,680
'Why didn't you tell me what you planned to
do?' he asked angrily. 'Where do you think

428
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,130
I'll get the money to pay her?'

429
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:13,370
'How did I know what the doctor would say?
I'm ashamed to have a husband like you, Ethan

430
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:21,580
Frome. I lost my health taking care of your
own mother! Marrying me was the least that

431
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,130
you could do after -'

432
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,850
'Zeena!'

433
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:33,460
The darkness between them was filled with
anger. It was their first moment of open fighting

434
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:42,510
in their sad seven years together. Ethan felt
ashamed, and tried to speak more calmly.

435
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:49,770
'You know I don't have the money, Zeena. She'll
have to go back.'

436
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:54,980
'What about that fifty dollars from Andrew
Hale?'

437
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:04,260
'He remembered the he lie had told the day
before. I guess that was a mistake.'

438
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,220
'You mean you ain't going to get it?'

439
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:17,980
'No. I'm sorry, Zeena. You're a poor man's
wife. But I'll do the best I can to help you.'

440
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:27,430
'Oh, I guess we'll manage,' she said more
gently. 'And without Mattie's food to pay

441
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,430
for -'

442
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:34,050
'Without Mattie's -?' he began.

443
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:42,910
Zeena laughed. It was a strange sound. He
couldn't remember hearing her laugh before.

444
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:47,460
'You didn't think Mattie was staying, did
you?'

445
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,110
'But you can't send her away - she's your
cousin.'

446
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:58,100
'Well, we can't keep two girls here.'

447
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,790
Ethan could not believe what he was hearing.

448
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:10,970
'Ethan - Zeena! Supper's ready!' Mattie called
brightly from downstairs.

449
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:20,570
Ethan felt angry and helpless. 'But where
will she go? A poor girl with no friends or

450
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:22,010
money...'

451
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:29,670
'She's been here long enough. We've kept her
for over a year now, and it's time for her

452
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,560
to go.'

453
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:40,230
Ethan looked at his wife with eyes full of
hate. It was an angry, bitter hate. It was

454
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:49,020
a hate, which had grown during years of hard
work, hopeless poverty, and broken dreams.

455
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:56,880
This woman had destroyed all his hopes. She
had taken everything from him, and now wanted

456
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:04,750
to take the one beautiful thing left in his
life. He made a sudden, violent movement towards

457
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,860
her, then stopped.

458
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:16,190
'I don't think I'll come down,' said Zeena
calmly. 'I guess I'll just lie on the bed

459
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,600
a while.'

460
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:26,880
Ethan went downstairs to the kitchen, and
Mattie gave him a plate of food. He took a

461
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,950
mouthful, then pushed the plate away.

462
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:36,920
'What's the matter, Ethan? Doesn't it taste
right?'

463
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:43,760
'It's fine, Matt. Only I -' He stood up quickly.

464
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,930
She looked at him with frightened eyes. 'I
knew there was something wrong. What is it,

465
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,620
Ethan? What is it?'

466
01:01:53,620 --> 01:02:01,510
He took her in his arms and found her lips
at last. He kissed and kissed her. He was

467
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:10,690
lost in the sweetness of her lips. Then she
pulled away from him, her face white with

468
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,200
fear, and he cried out:

469
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:18,440
'You can't go, Matt! I'll never let you go!'

470
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:32,800
'Go... go?' she whispered. 'Must I go? Ethan,
what has happened? Is Zeena angry with me?'

471
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:41,480
He told her what the doctor had said. Mattie
looked so small and helpless. His heart ached

472
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:50,750
for her, and he wanted to hold her in his
arms again. They were silent for a long while,

473
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,500
then Mattie said in a low voice:

474
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,720
'Don't be too sorry, Ethan.'

475
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:04,310
'Oh, Matt - Matt - where'll you go?'

476
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:11,460
'Maybe I'll get something to do in town.'
But they both knew that she had little chance

477
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:19,240
of finding a job. There were too many people
looking for work in the towns, and there were

478
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:27,960
no jobs that Mattie could do. And Ethan knew
what happened to girls who had no job, no

479
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:38,740
money, and no friends... He sat down in despair,
and hid his face in his hands.

480
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:47,830
Then they heard Zeena's footsteps on the stairs.
She came down wearing her usual dress. Then

481
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:56,750
she sat down in her usual seat, and took a
large plateful of food. She ate well, and

482
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:05,340
talked in an everyday way about the illnesses
of her friends and family in Bettsbridge.

483
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:13,170
As she spoke, she looked at Mattie with a
small smile on her thin lips. When supper

484
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:17,610
was finished, she stood up and said:

485
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:24,670
'That meal's given me a stomachache. I think
I'll go and look for the stomach medicine

486
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:28,640
that I bought last year.'

487
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:38,500
She left the room. Ethan's and Mattie's eyes
met, full of silent despair. The kitchen looked

488
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:48,170
as warm and peaceful as the night before,
but now everything had changed. Then suddenly

489
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:57,060
Zeena was back, her face burning with anger.
In her hands, she held the broken pieces of

490
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,480
the red glass dish.

491
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:06,470
'I want to know who did this,' she said in
a shaking voice.

492
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:13,950
'I can tell you. It was the cat,' answered
Ethan after a few moments.

493
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:20,210
'The cat? How did the cat get into my hall
cupboard?'

494
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:30,600
'Oh, Zeena, it was my fault, not Ethan's!'
cried Mattie. 'I got it down from your cupboard.

495
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:36,180
I - I wanted the supper table to look pretty,'

496
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:44,050
'You wanted the supper table to look pretty!
So you rook my very best dish, the one that

497
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:54,900
I never, ever use. Not for visitors, not for
anyone. You're a bad girl, Mattie Silver,

498
01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:04,280
just like your father. I always knew you were
bad - that's why I hid my things from you.

499
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:14,320
And now you've taken the thing that I cared
for the most -' Tears ran down her thin, yellowish

500
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:37,190
face. Then she left the room, carrying the
pieces of broken glass like a dead body.

501
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,660
CHAPTER SIX

502
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,700
No escape

503
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:50,960
When Zeena had gone, Ethan and Mattie stood
in silence for a moment. Then Mattie began

504
01:06:50,960 --> 01:07:00,170
to tidy the kitchen and Ethan went outside
to check the animals, as he did every night.

505
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:09,270
The room was empty when he returned, but on
the table under his pipe was a piece of paper.

506
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:16,540
Three words were written on it: 'Ethan, don't
worry'.

507
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:24,350
There was a small room at the back of the
house where Ethan kept his books and papers.

508
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:31,480
His mother had let him use it as a study-room
when he first returned to the farm after his

509
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:41,171
father's accident. He still sat there in summer,
but the room had no fire and in winter, it

510
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:50,220
was too cold. This was where he went to look
again at his message from Mattie. It was the

511
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:59,670
first time she had ever written to him. He
read her words and felt nearer to her, but

512
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:08,760
at the same time, he remembered that very
soon he would never see her again. 'Soon there'll

513
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:21,980
be no warm smile, no gentle voice, only this
- cold paper and dead words,' he thought.

514
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:29,670
He lay down on a hard little bed that was
there, covered himself with an old coat, and

515
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:38,100
began to think about his life. He had lost
so many chances and forgotten so many of his

516
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:48,010
dreams, all to please Zeena. But she was now
far more discontented than when he had married

517
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:58,710
her. Must he live the rest of his days beside
this bitter, complaining woman? No. He was

518
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:07,069
too young and strong, too full of life to
throw away all hope of happiness. Then he

519
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:15,130
thought - why shouldn't he leave with Mattie
the next day? He would hide his suitcase under

520
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:20,790
the seat of the sleigh, leave Zeena a letter...

521
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:28,950
He jumped up, lit the lamp again, sat down
at the table and began to write.

522
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:38,609
Zeena, 'I've done everything I could for you.
But it hasn't worked. It's neither my fault

523
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:47,880
nor yours. Maybe it'll be better for both
of us if we live apart. I'm going to see what

524
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:57,500
I can find in the West. You can sell the farm
and sawmill and keep the money -'

525
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:03,720
At that word, he stopped writing and began
to think.

526
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:10,640
Without the farm, he would have no money.
He was sure that he could find work in the

527
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:19,280
West, but would he get enough money to take
care of Mattie too? And what about Zeena,

528
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:28,570
alone on the farm? She couldn't keep it going
on her own, and it would be hard to sell.

529
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:36,920
The land was poor and not many people would
want to buy it. But how could he let poor

530
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,600
Mattie leave alone?

531
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:50,740
As he picked up his pen, his eye fell on a
Bettsbridge newspaper. He saw the words 'Journeys

532
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:59,170
to the West', and pulled the lamp nearer to
see the prices of the tickets. Then the pen

533
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:07,480
fell from his hand, and he pushed the unfinished
letter away. He didn't even have the money

534
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:15,150
to take Mattie to the West. He had already
borrowed to mend the sawmill, and couldn't

535
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:25,000
borrow any more. The cold facts closed around
him like prison doors. There was no way out

536
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:37,170
- none. He was locked in that prison for life,
and now his one light was disappearing.

537
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:45,930
He lay down again with a heavy heart and tears
burning in his eyes. Through the window, he

538
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:52,240
saw the snow-covered slopes shining in the
moonlight, the silver-edged darkness of the

539
01:11:52,240 --> 01:12:00,120
woods, and the shadowy purple of the hills
against the sky. He felt that the beauty of

540
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:07,880
the night was laughing at him, lying there
so miserably.

541
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:17,150
He fell asleep. In the morning, he woke cold
and hungry. He went to the window, and saw

542
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:26,060
a red sun coming up over the grey edges of
the fields. 'This is Matt's last day,' he

543
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:33,330
said to himself. He tried to think how the
place would be without her.

544
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:42,840
He heard a step behind him, turned round and
saw Mattie. She looked so small and thin,

545
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,930
standing there in her poor dress in the cold,
wintry light.

546
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:54,600
'I'll come and light the kitchen fire,' he
said.

547
01:12:54,600 --> 01:13:01,790
Mattie started her usual morning housework.
The kitchen slowly became warmer, and the

548
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:11,000
first sunlight entered the room. Ethan began
to feel more hopeful. 'Maybe Zeena didn't

549
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:20,270
mean what she said,' he thought, 'Maybe, now
that daylight's here, she'll think again and

550
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,870
let Mattie stay.'

551
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:33,230
He went up to Mattie and touched her arm gently.
'I don't, want you to worry, Matt,' he said,

552
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:41,060
looking down into her eyes with a smile. 'I
guess things will be all right.'

553
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:49,350
'No, I ain't going to worry,' she said softly.

554
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:57,440
He went out to the farm, and soon afterwards,
Jotham Powell joined him. As they were doing

555
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,420
their morning's work with the COWS, Jotham
said:

556
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:10,320
'Mrs Frome told me the new girl's coming'
today, and Mattie's leaving'. I got to take

557
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:18,950
her down to the station.' Ethan felt the blood
beating in his head. After a moment, he found

558
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,910
his voice, and said:

559
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:24,840
'Oh, it ain't so sure that Mattie's going
-'

560
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:35,260
'Is that so?' said Jotham, not at all interested,
and he went on with his work.

561
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:42,590
When they returned to the kitchen, the two
women were already at breakfast. Zeena was

562
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:50,380
eating well, and seemed very lively and busy.
She looked at the hired man.

563
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:59,140
'Jotham, I want you here mid-afternoon to
pick up Mattie,' she said. The new girls getting

564
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:07,730
to the station at five o'clock. Mattie can
get the train at six.' Then she turned to

565
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:16,210
Mattie and went on, 'Now, what've you done
with one of my best cotton sheets? And there

566
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:24,260
are a few other things missing, too.' Mattie
followed Zeena out of the room, leaving the

567
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,650
two men alone.

568
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:35,500
'I guess I'll come round mid-afternoon, then,'
said Jotham to his employer.

569
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:43,230
When the morning's work was finished, Ethan
said to Jotham: 'I'm going down to Starkfield.

570
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:47,950
Tell them not to wait for me at dinnertime.'

571
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:55,660
It was a clear, still morning, with a whisper
of spring in the air. The snowy fields shone

572
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:05,391
silver in the bright morning sunlight. Ethan
walked down the road, angry and ashamed. So

573
01:16:05,391 --> 01:16:13,750
Mattie really was leaving, and he could only
stand by, helpless. What must she think of

574
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:23,000
him? As he walked, he could feel laughing
voice in the song of the birds. He knew that

575
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,220
he had to do something. But what?

576
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:38,330
Then a thought came to him. Andrew Hale was
a kind-hearted man. 'Maybe,' thought Ethan,

577
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:45,630
'he'll let me have some money now, if I tell
him that Zeena's really sick and that we need

578
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:54,260
a hired girl to help her. Mrs Hale will listen
to me, I'm sure.'

579
01:16:54,260 --> 01:17:02,720
He thought about this idea as he walked faster
and faster down the road. With each long step,

580
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:11,180
he felt more sure of his plan's success. And
with fifty dollars in his pocket, nothing

581
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,630
could keep him from Mattie...

582
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:22,930
As he came into Starkfield, he saw the Hales'
sleigh, and hurried forward to meet it. The

583
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:31,920
sleigh stopped, and Mrs Hale's round, motherly
face looked out. She smiled at Ethan, told

584
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,690
him that her husband was at home, then added:

585
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:45,190
'I'm sorry that Zeena's feeling bad again.
She's lucky to have you to take care of her.

586
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:54,670
And so was your poor mother. You've had an
awful hard life, Ethan Frome.'

587
01:17:54,670 --> 01:18:02,630
When she had gone, Ethan felt less alone in
his unhappiness. It had been a long time since

588
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:11,160
anyone had spoken to him as kindly as Mrs
Hale. The Hales were caring people who felt

589
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:18,520
sorry for him, and now he felt sure that they
would help him.

590
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:26,900
He started down the road to their house, then
stopped after a few steps. He suddenly saw

591
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:35,950
himself, and his life, in the clear light
of day. He was a poor man, planning to leave

592
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:44,020
his sickly wife all alone and without money.
And how was he planning to do this heartless

593
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:54,160
thing? By telling lies to two kind people
who felt sorry for him.

594
01:18:54,160 --> 01:19:12,140
He turned and walked slowly back to the farm.

595
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,400
CHAPTER SEVEN

596
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,900
The last ride

597
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:27,110
It was about midday when Ethan got home. Zeena
was by the fire with a scarf on her head and

598
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:34,020
a book about stomach pains in her hand. She
did not move or look up.

599
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:38,480
'Where's Mattie?' Ethan asked.

600
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:47,690
Zeena continued to read her book. 'I guess
she's packing her case,' she replied.

601
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:58,170
Ethan went straight upstairs. Mattie's door
was closed. 'Matt,' he said in a low voice.

602
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:04,690
There was no answer, so he gently pushed open
the door.

603
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:11,980
Mattie was sitting on her case in her best
dress, with her back to the door and her face

604
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:20,160
in her hands. She was crying. Ethan put his
hands on her shoulders.

605
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:26,760
'Matt - oh, don't - oh, Matt!'

606
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:36,770
'Ethan - I thought you weren't coming back!'
she cried, lifting her wet face to his.

607
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:45,360
He took her in his arms, and kissed her soft
hair. Then they heard Zeena calling, and moved

608
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,790
away from each other.

609
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:56,100
He carried her suitcase downstairs, and with
every 'tick' of the clock, the pain in his

610
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,440
heart grew.

611
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:08,400
At dinner, he could eat nothing. After the
meal, Zeena sat down by the fire and Mattie

612
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:16,250
began to wash the dishes, Jotham got up from
the table and asked Ethan:

613
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:21,170
'So what time will I come round for Mattie?'

614
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:28,690
'You needn't come round; I'm going to drive
her over myself,' he answered.

615
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:35,900
Zeena lifted her head. 'I want you here this
afternoon, Ethan. You'll have to get the room

616
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:40,970
ready for the new girl. Jotham can take Mattie.'

617
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:50,801
'I'm going to drive her over myself,' he repeated
in a hard voice. He turned to Mattie: 'You

618
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:57,420
be ready at three, Matt. I've got business
in Corbury.'

619
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:04,650
With those words, he left the house. He could
feel the hot blood beating in his head, as

620
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:14,250
the anger burned inside him. He hurried through
his work, then went to get the horse and sleigh.

621
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:19,400
He remembered the day when he had got the
sleigh ready in order to fetch his wife's

622
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:28,130
cousin from the station. It was little more
than a year ago, on a soft afternoon just

623
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:36,630
like this, with a whisper of spring in the
air. And all the days between then and now

624
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:41,380
came back to him, one by one.

625
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:49,020
He jumped into the sleigh and drove up to
the house. The kitchen was empty, and Mattie's

626
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:57,630
case and coat lay ready by the door. After
a moment, he heard someone moving about in

627
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:05,610
his study-room. He pushed open the door and
saw Mattie standing by the table.

628
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:09,750
'What are you doing in there, Matt?'

629
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:13,690
'Just looking round,' she replied.

630
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:16,250
'Where's Zeena?'

631
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:22,610
'Gone upstairs. She said she had her pains
again.'

632
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,750
'Didn't she say goodbye?'

633
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:30,060
'No. That was all she said.'

634
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:37,710
They went back into the kitchen. Ethan looked
slowly around the room, thinking, 'In a few

635
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:47,831
hours I shall return here alone. I'm looking
at Mattie here for the last time.' He could

636
01:23:47,831 --> 01:23:52,690
not believe it; it all seemed so unreal.

637
01:23:52,690 --> 01:24:04,210
'Come on,' he said, opening the door. He helped
her into the sleigh, and with a 'Go along!'

638
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:09,010
to the horse, they started off down the hill.

639
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:19,650
'We got lots of time for a good ride, Matt!'
he said, taking her hand in his.

640
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:26,480
As they left the farm, he did not take the
road towards Starkfield, but turned the horse

641
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:33,950
to the light, up the Bettsbridge road. Mattie
did not seem surprised.

642
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:38,170
'Are you going round by Shadow Pond?'

643
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:44,130
'You knew, didn't you?' he laughed.

644
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:51,580
The road took them down into a wood, where
the trees shone reddish in the afternoon sun,

645
01:24:51,580 --> 01:25:00,250
leaving soft blue shadows on the untouched
snow. There was a warm stillness in the wood.

646
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:12,130
In the middle was a small icy pond, with sweet-smelling
trees all around. It was a quiet, secret place,

647
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:21,650
like the quiet sadness in Ethan's heart. They
saw a fallen tree by the icy water, half covered

648
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:30,170
in snow. It was where they had sat once last
August, together with a group of young people

649
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:34,170
from Starkfield church.

650
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:43,830
They sat down now in the same place, and remembered
those few happy moments from that hot summer

651
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:52,580
afternoon. Ethan looked at Mattie's hair,
and wished he could touch it again. He wanted

652
01:25:52,580 --> 01:26:00,370
to tell her that it smelled of the woods in
springtime, but he had never learned to say

653
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:03,560
things like that.

654
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:12,540
When the sun began to go down behind the hill,
Mattie said: 'We mustn't stay here any longer.'

655
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:20,830
As they drove back towards Starkfield, the
sky was turning grey, with a cold red over

656
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:23,230
the western hills.

657
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:32,630
'Matt,' Ethan said at last. 'What'll you do?
Can't you ask your father's family for help?'

658
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:44,130
'I don't want to ask them,' she replied, then
after a moment added: 'I guess I'll find something.'

659
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:46,920
'You know I'd do anything for you -'

660
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,500
'Yes, I know.'

661
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,570
'But I can't -'

662
01:26:53,570 --> 01:27:04,310
She was silent, but he felt her shoulder shaking.
'Oh, Matt,' he cried. 'I wish...'

663
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:14,580
She turned to him. 'Ethan, I found this.'
She held out a piece of paper. It was the

664
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:22,530
unfinished letter to his wife, which he had
forgotten to destroy. A painful happiness

665
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:32,180
ran through him. Were Mattie's dreams the
same as his? He had to know. 'Do you feel

666
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:37,650
like that too, Matt? Tell me, Matt, tell me!'

667
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:47,210
'Oh, Ethan, what does it matter now?' she
cried. With a sudden movement, she tore the

668
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:56,330
letter into pieces and threw them onto the
snow. For a moment, she was silent, then said

669
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:58,030
in a low voice:

670
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:07,100
'The first time I thought of you like that
was at Shadow Pond. Then I often used to think

671
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:15,760
about you on summer nights when the moon was
too bright and I couldn't sleep.'

672
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:24,510
Her words filled Ethan's heart with sweetness.
Darkness began to fall and they drove on in

673
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:28,430
silence for a while.

674
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:37,860
'I'm fastened hand and foot, Matt. There isn't
a thing I can do,' he began again.

675
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:41,620
'You must write to me sometimes, Ethan.'

676
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:49,550
'Oh, what can writing do? I want to put my
hand out and touch you. I want to take care

677
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:54,700
of you. I want to be there when you're sick
and when you're lonely.'

678
01:28:54,700 --> 01:29:02,570
'Oh, Ethan, I wish I was dead!' she cried.

679
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:08,150
'Don't let's talk that way,' he whispered.

680
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:14,820
As they arrived in Starkfield, a sleigh with
bells passed them. They heard happy children's

681
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:22,860
voices and saw a group of village boys with
sleds. They drove on to the top of the Corbury

682
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:30,320
road. On one side was the tall white shape
of the church, on the other were the dark

683
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:39,930
shadows of the Varnum trees. The steep slope
lay empty and white below them. An idea came

684
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:49,270
to Ethan, to help himself and her through
their miserable last hour. He turned to Mattie.

685
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:57,520
'We never went coasting last night. Shall
we go down now? How would you like that?'

686
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,930
'There isn't time!'

687
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:09,070
'There's as much time as we want,' he said.
'The hired girl can wait. Lock, someone's

688
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,690
left a sled under the trees.'

689
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:19,710
He helped her out of the sleigh, and took
her by the hand towards the sled. They both

690
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:24,830
sat down on it, with Mattie in front and Ethan
behind.

691
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:30,970
'It's so dark, Ethan. Are you sure you can
see?'

692
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:39,880
'Oh, I can do this with my eyes closed!' he
laughed. She laughed with him, then after

693
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:49,550
a moment, he cried: 'Now!' They started off,
and soon the sled was flying down the slope,

694
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:56,990
round the corner by the big tree, and down
the second slope. They came to a stop, picked

695
01:30:56,990 --> 01:31:01,840
up the sled, and began to climb up the hill
again.

696
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,950
'It was wonderful!' laughed Mattie.

697
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:10,270
'Weren't you afraid when we went round the
tree?'

698
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:14,170
'I'm never afraid with you,' she replied.

699
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:22,700
A deep silence seemed to fall from the starless
sky. At each step of their climb, Ethan said

700
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:29,740
to himself: 'If's the last time we'll ever
walk together.'

701
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:36,700
When they reached the Varnum trees, Ethan
put back the sled. 'I guess this must be Ned

702
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,630
Hale's sled,' he said.

703
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:49,670
'Is this where Ned and Ruth kissed each other?'
Mattie whispered throwing her arms round Ethan.

704
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:55,510
Her lips found his, and Ethan held her close
to him.

705
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:04,140
'Goodbye - goodbye,' she said in a shaking
voice, and kissed him again.

706
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:15,070
'Matt, I can't let you go! What'll we do?
What'll we do?' They stood holding hands like

707
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:21,020
children. Through the stillness, they heard
the church clock.

708
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:27,770
'Oh, Ethan, it's already five o'clock. It's
time!'

709
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:37,620
'Time for what? I'm not leaving you now. How
can we go anywhere without each other, after

710
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,740
this?'

711
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:47,450
Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck
again. 'Ethan! Ethan! I want you to take me

712
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:49,070
down again!'

713
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:51,680
'Down where?'

714
01:32:51,680 --> 01:33:00,650
'Down there. Into the tree, to finish it all.
Then we'll never have to leave each other

715
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,790
again.'

716
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:10,160
'Matt! What are you saying? Are you crazy?'

717
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:20,900
'No, but I will be crazy if I leave you. Where'll
I go without you? You're the only person who's

718
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:29,340
ever been good to me. And there'll be a strange
girl sleeping in my bed where I used to lie

719
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:35,130
at night and think of you...'

720
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:43,640
Her words were like pieces torn from his heart.
Now at last he knew that Mattie's feelings

721
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:51,150
were as strong as his. How could he go back
to that hated house, to the woman who was

722
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:54,490
waiting for him there?

723
01:33:54,490 --> 01:34:02,340
He held her close and kissed her, but when
her face touched his, it was cold and wet

724
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:12,660
with tears. He saw the road down to the station,
and through the still air, he heard a train.

725
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:21,630
The dark trees covered them in blackness and
silence, like a grave. 'Perhaps it'll be like

726
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:29,620
this,' he thought. 'After this I won't feel
anything.'

727
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:38,040
'Come,' she whispered, pulling at his hand.
He picked the sled up, and they took their

728
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:47,940
places on it. This time he made her sit behind
him. She put her arms round him, and he turned

729
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:57,530
his head and kissed her. She was right - this
was better than being apart.

730
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:05,239
Just as they started, he heard his horse whinny.
First came the steep drop, and they seemed

731
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:13,841
to be flying through the air, high up into
the cloudy night. Then Ethan saw the big tree

732
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:22,090
at the corner of the road, and he said between
his teeth: 'We can do it; I know we can do

733
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,750
it -'

734
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:30,310
As they flew towards the tree, Mattie held
him closer and he seemed to feel her heart

735
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:41,450
beating. The tree became bigger and nearer.
'It's waiting for us; it knows,' he thought.

736
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:49,960
But suddenly his wife's face, grim and twisted,
appeared before him, and he moved to push

737
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:57,380
the picture away. There was a last moment
when the air shot past him like millions of

738
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:05,380
burning stars. And then the tree...

739
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:14,610
The sky was still cloudy, but when he looked
straight up he saw a single star. What was

740
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:24,320
its name? He used to know, but he couldn't
remember. He felt so tired... Through the

741
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:33,410
deep stillness, he heard a little animal making
a small, frightened sound. He knew the animal

742
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:41,380
was in terrible pain - he could feel its pain
shooting through his own body. He reached

743
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:49,650
out his left arm to help the poor animal,
and felt something soft under his hand. He

744
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:58,290
tried to move but could not, because there
was a rock, or some heavy thing, lying on

745
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:08,530
him. Then he realized that his hand was on
Mattie's face, and the sound was coming from

746
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:11,530
her lips...

747
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:20,950
He put his face next to hers, and in the darkness,
he saw her eyes open and heard her say his

748
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:22,640
name.

749
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:36,150
'Oh, Matt, I thought we'd done it,' he whispered;
and far away, up the hill, he heard the horse

750
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:57,860
whinny, and thought: 'I ought to give him
his supper...'

751
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:00,310
CHAPTER EIGHT

752
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:02,970
Endings

753
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:10,610
The whining voice stopped as I stepped into
Frome's kitchen. There were two women sitting

754
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:17,110
there, and I could not tell which one had
been the speaker.

755
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:23,350
One of them stood up when we entered, and
without a word went to bring a dish of food

756
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:32,380
to the table. She was tall and thin, and wore
an untidy, shapeless dress. Her lined face

757
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:40,320
and thin lips were of the same yellowish colour,
and she had thin grey hair and grey, lifeless

758
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,720
eyes.

759
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:51,430
The other woman was smaller, and she also
had grey hair and a thin, bloodless face.

760
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:59,300
She turned her head towards me quickly, but
her body did not move at all. Her dark eyes

761
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:07,380
shone with the crazy brightness that is sometimes
seen in people with disease of the spine.

762
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:15,200
The kitchen was a poor place. The few pieces
of furniture were of the poorest kind, mostly

763
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,090
broken and dirty.

764
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:25,400
'My, it's cold in here,' said Frome, looking
around.

765
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:33,320
The tall woman said nothing, but the dark-eyed
woman answered complainingly, in a thin, whining

766
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,550
voice:

767
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:43,300
'It's Zeena's fault. She fell asleep and the
fire went out. I've been so cold, waiting

768
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,720
for her to wake up.'

769
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:52,410
I knew then that it was her voice that I had
heard.

770
01:39:52,410 --> 01:40:00,900
The tall woman brought the food to the table.
Frome looked at me and said: 'This is my wife,

771
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:09,760
Mrs Frome.' After a moment, he added, turning
to the figure in the armchair: 'And this is

772
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,680
Miss Mattie Silver...

773
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:21,360
Ruth Hale was very pleased to see me return
safely in the morning, and most surprised

774
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,960
to hear how I had spent the night.

775
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:33,400
'You must be the first stranger there in twenty
years,' she said. 'It's awful to see them,

776
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:42,271
all locked up together in that house. And
they're not easy people, any of them. Mattie

777
01:40:42,271 --> 01:40:52,660
used to be; before the accident, she was a
really sweet girl. But not now - she's had

778
01:40:52,660 --> 01:41:02,430
too much pain. Now, when she and Zeena fight,
the look on Ethan's face is enough to break

779
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:04,580
your heart.'

780
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:10,310
'Yes, it must be awful for them,' I agreed.

781
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:17,970
'It was just terrible at the beginning,' she
went on. 'They brought Mattie here, and I

782
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:27,720
stayed with her all night. Then in the morning,
she opened her eyes and said... Oh, I don't

783
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:34,700
know why I'm telling you this...' She stopped,
crying.

784
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:41,780
After a few moments, she dried her tears and
continued: 'Then when the doctors said we

785
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:49,130
could move Mattie, Zeena sent for her and
took her back to the farm.'

786
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:54,050
'And she's been there ever since?' I asked.

787
01:41:54,050 --> 01:42:02,550
There was no other place for her to go,' Ruth
Hale answered simply; and I thought how hard

788
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:05,800
life was for the poor.

789
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:14,320
'Zeena's cared for the pair of them for over
twenty years now,' Ruth Hale went on. 'And

790
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:20,650
there they all are, shut up in that one kitchen.'

791
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:25,760
Then she looked at me and said in a low voice:

792
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:33,140
There was one day, about a week after the
accident, when they thought Mattie couldn't

793
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:45,330
live. Well, I say it was a pity she did. People
think that's an awful thing to say, but they

794
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:54,000
weren't with her when she first woke up...
And I say this, too. All those years with

795
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:03,500
Mattie have destroyed Ethan. The way they
are now, there's not much difference between

796
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:13,330
the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down
in their graves - except that down there they're

797
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:24,090
all silent and the women have to keep quiet.'

798
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:37,980
- THE END -
