00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,400
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
What is a Desert

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,000
A desert is a dry place that has 
less than 25 centimeters of rain  

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,360
every year. Some deserts have no rain for 
months or years. Some deserts have sand,  

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,960
but others have stones or rocks. 
Some deserts are in the mountains.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,960
In the day, temperatures in hot deserts are 
usually from 20 to 35 degrees centigrade,  

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
but temperatures can be more than 50 degrees.  

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,480
At night, the air gets very cold. 
Sometimes, it's less than 0 degrees.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,880
Most cold deserts are warm in summer, but they are 
very cold in winter. In summer, temperatures are  

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:05,920
usually from 21 to 26 degrees centigrade. In 
winter, they are usually from 2 to 4 degrees.  

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,000
Most of the water in cold deserts comes 
from snow or fog. It doesn't come from rain.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,240
It snows in Antarctica, but this only 
makes about 5 centimeters of water  

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,360
every year. It's the biggest 
and coldest desert on Earth.
 
 
 

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
CHAPTER TWO

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,680
Different Deserts

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,240
More than 20 percent of the land on Earth 
is desert. There are many different deserts.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,800
The Sahara Desert, in North Africa, 
is the biggest hot desert on Earth.  

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:01,920
It's 9 million square kilometers - that's about as 
big as the USA! The Sahara has sand dunes, rocks,  

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:12,880
and mountains. Some of the sand dunes are 180 
meters tall. The Sahara has very strong winds  

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,600
that make big sandstorms. The sandstorms 
can take plants and animals into the air!

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,720
The Atacama Desert is in Peru 
and Chile. It's not very hot,  

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,360
and it's one of the oldest and driest deserts 
on Earth. It has less than 1 millimeter of rain  

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,440
every year! Scientists think that at one 
time, it didn't rain here for 400 years.

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,360
There aren't many deserts in Europe. There's one  

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
small desert in Spain. It's 
called the Tabernas Desert.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,680
The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and China. 
It's 1,300,000 square kilometers and it's  

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,360
in the mountains. Most of the land is 
rock. It's one of the coldest deserts  

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,920
on Earth. In winter, the temperature 
can be minus 40 degrees centigrade!
 
 
 

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,160
CHAPTER THREE

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,280
Plants

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
Deserts are very dry places, 
but plants can still grow there.  

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
Desert plants collect and 
use water in special ways.

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,040
The cactus has big roots, so it can 
collect water fast when it rains.  

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,760
It stores water in its stem for when there 
isn't any rain. Many cactus plants have spikes.  

35
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,160
The spikes also collect water, and 
they stop animals eating the plant.

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,160
There are about 1,200 different 
types of plant in the Sahara Desert.

37
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,280
The welwitschia plant gets water from fog.

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,360
The leaves collect the water and it goes down  

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,840
into the soil. Then the plant 
takes up the water with its roots.

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,600
The baobab tree grows in the deserts 
in Africa and Australia. It can store  

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
thousands of liters of water.  

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,920
Some baobab trees are more than 9 meters across! 
Desert people can drink the water from this tree.

43
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,840
The seeds of many desert plants can stay in the 
soil for a long time. When it rains, they grow  

44
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,680
fast and produce flowers. Then they die, but 
they leave seeds for the next time it rains.
 
 
 

45
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,840
CHAPTER FOUR

46
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,520
Animals

47
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,760
It's hard to live in the desert, but deserts 
are homes for many different animals.

48
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Insects, like ants, can live underground when 
it's hot. They put their eggs underground, too.  

49
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,160
Insects are important because 
bigger animals need them for food.

50
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,280
Spiders and scorpions are arachnids. 
Many desert arachnids are poisonous.  

51
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,360
They use their poison to catch 
insects and other small animals.

52
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
Mammals are animals that drink milk 
from their mother when they are young.  

53
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,840
Many desert mammals can live for days with no 
water because they can get water from plants.

54
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,040
Desert jerboas make water in their 
body when they eat dry seeds and roots!

55
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,720
Reptiles, like snakes, lizards, and 
desert tortoises, have a thick skin.  

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
This helps their body to save water.  

57
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,840
Most reptiles get food and water from other 
animals, but desert tortoises eat plants.

58
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:47,840
Some deserts even have fish. Pupfish live in 
small rivers in the deserts in North America.
 
 
 

59
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
CHAPTER FIVE

60
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,880
Day and Night

61
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,840
In deserts around the world, different 
animals come out at different times.

62
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:13,360
Reptiles come out in the morning to get warm in 
the sun. Lizards lie on rocks to get warm. They  

63
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,800
lie in the shade when it's too hot. Desert 
tortoises look for food in the morning.  

64
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:30,000
At night, they stay in their burrows so that 
they are warm and safe from other animals.

65
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,960
Many desert birds also come out in the day.  

66
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,480
In the morning, they look for 
spiders, insects, and seeds.

67
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:48,720
Most desert animals sleep in the day and come out 
at night. Many small animals sleep in burrows.  

68
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,280
Bigger animals, like foxes, 
sleep in big holes called dens.

69
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,080
At night, scorpions look for food. 
Scorpions have tiny hairs on their legs.  

70
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,840
The hairs help the scorpions 
to feel other animals moving.

71
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,640
Some animals, like desert cats and owls, 
have special eyes to help them to see well  

72
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:28,560
at night. Owls can also hear very well, 
so they know when animals are moving.
 
 
 

73
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
CHAPTER SIX

74
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,240
People

75
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,640
About 13% of all the people 
in the world live in deserts.  

76
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,200
Some people lived in deserts a long time ago.

77
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Aborigines were the first people of Australia. 
They lived in the deserts in Australia more than  

78
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:07,840
40,000 years ago! Aborigines use art to tell 
stories. Many Aborigines live in cities today,  

79
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
but some are going back to their 
traditional life in the desert.

80
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:22,960
Tuareg people lived in the Sahara Desert 
more than 2,000 years ago. They are called  

81
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,480
the blue people because of 
the color of their clothes.  

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,720
Traditional Tuaregs travel across the desert on 
camels. They live in tents made from animal skins  

83
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,440
and wood. Many Tuaregs have 
farms, and others work in cities.

84
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Bedouin people lived in the deserts hundreds of 
years ago. They live in the Middle East and North  

85
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:01,520
Africa. Traditional Bedouins are traveling 
farmers. They live in tents or mud houses.  

86
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,600
Today, many Bedouins work in cities. 
Some Bedouins make and sell things.
 
 
 

87
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,920
CHAPTER SEVEN

88
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,840
Water in the Desert

89
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Deserts are very dry places, 
but all deserts have some water.

90
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,400
An oasis is a place where water from 
under the ground makes a lake or pond.  

91
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:44,160
Some oases are small, but some are very big. 
The Siwa Oasis in Egypt is 80 kilometers long  

92
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,680
and 20 kilometers across. 
About 23,000 people live here.

93
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,840
Some deserts have rivers. The Nile 
River travels through the Sahara Desert.  

94
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,600
Many people live near this river. They can 
catch fish and use the water for farming.

95
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,480
In some deserts, there are big rainstorms. 
Then there's no more rain for a long time.  

96
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,480
So it's very important to collect rainwater.  

97
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,240
In the Thar Desert, people collect 
water in ponds, wells, and big tanks.

98
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,280
People in some cold deserts use 
nets to collect the water from fog.

99
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Each net can catch about 14 
liters of water every day.
 
 
 

100
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
CHAPTER EIGHT

101
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
Staying Cool

102
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,400
Many people and animals live in hot deserts. 
They have different ways to stay cool.

103
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,720
Desert people use their clothes 
and houses to stay cool.  

104
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,960
Bedouin and Tuareg people wear long clothes 
to protect them from the hot sun and the wind.  

105
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,920
They wear a head cloth to 
protect their head and face.

106
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,080
People in deserts build houses with small 
windows so that it stays cool inside.  

107
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:37,840
This keeps out the sun and also the 
wind. Some desert houses have no windows!

108
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,920
Many big desert animals stay in 
a cool place in the day. Oryxes  

109
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,840
make a cool hole to sit in, 
or they sit in the shade.

110
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,520
Some desert lizards are called sand swimmers.  

111
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,520
When it's hot, these lizards 
swim under the sand to stay cool.

112
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:12,560
Some animals, like crocodiles, snakes, 
and frogs, sleep in the hottest parts  

113
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:20,480
of summer. Other animals, like desert 
tortoises, sleep in winter in cold deserts.
 
 
 

114
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,720
CHAPTER NINE

115
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,120
Living in the Desert

116
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,840
Living in the desert is very 
different from living in a city,  

117
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,320
but people still cook, travel, and go to school.

118
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,840
Most desert people eat bread, porridge, 
milk, cheese, and food from desert plants.  

119
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
They cook their food on a fire outside their home.  

120
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,960
Dates grow well in deserts. Dates with 
cheese is traditional Tuareg food.

121
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Every year, there's a festival in the 
Sahara Desert, near Timbuktu in Mali.  

122
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,840
There are three days of music, 
dancing, and camel racing.

123
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,120
Today, many desert people drive SUVs, but 
camels are better for traveling across sand!  

124
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,840
Camels can travel more than 40 kilometers 
in a day. They are strong animals.  

125
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,840
Desert people can use camels to carry food, 
tents, and other things from their homes.

126
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,440
A long time ago, only a few 
desert children went to school,  

127
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,600
but this is changing. In the deserts in 
Australia, Aborigines are building new schools.  

128
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,600
Students speak their own language, 
and they also learn English.
 
 
 

129
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,680
CHAPTER TEN

130
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
Desertification

131
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,920
Deserts are getting bigger. Every year, 
the land around many deserts gets dry  

132
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,840
and changes into new desert. 
This is called desertification.

133
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:33,040
The land can get too dry when there's no rain 
for a long time. Sometimes people also make  

134
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:41,280
the land dry. When there are too many farms 
in one place, animals eat all the plants,  

135
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:48,480
and the soil blows away. Then new plants 
can't grow and there isn't food for everyone.

136
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:59,520
Desertification is a big problem in countries in 
Africa near the Sahara Desert. In 50 years, these  

137
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:08,880
countries have lost 650,000 square kilometers 
of land - that's about the same size as France.  

138
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,320
Millions of people here are hungry, 
because they can't grow food in the desert.

139
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:25,280
How can people help to stop desertification? 
In many countries, people are growing more  

140
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:34,080
trees. Trees stop the soil blowing away. 
In China, people are using a wall of trees  

141
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:49,840
to stop desertification near the Gobi Desert. 
The wall is 4,000 kilometers long!
 
 
 
 

142
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,418
- THE END -
