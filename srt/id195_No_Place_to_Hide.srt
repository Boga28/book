CHAPTER ONE
New York City in fall

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,279
Monday, October 4th.

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,440
A cool, clear morning with the promise of
a fine day ahead.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:22,270
Fall is my favorite season in this city - the
break between summer heat and winter cold.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,570
It's a time when you're not trying to escape
the worst of New York's weather.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,780
In the city parks, leaves on the trees were
just beginning to turn red and gold.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,059
The name's Nat Marley, licensed private investigator.

8
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:47,210
Before I became an investigator, I used to
be a police officer - a cop with the NYPD,

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,149
the New York Police Department.

10
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,329
Since then, I've worked for myself.

11
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,270
So what does "private investigator" make you
think of?

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:05,180
A cool handsome guy with an exciting, sometimes
dangerous, job?

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,070
Think again.

14
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,480
Some of the time I'm looking for missing persons.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,030
Or maybe I'm watching a husband to find out
if he's seeing another woman.

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:24,250
And when I look in the mirror, I see an ordinary
guy in his forties who's losing his hair.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,530
As usual, I caught the number seven subway
train from my home in Flushing Main Street,

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,780
Queens, to Midtown Manhattan.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,700
Through Queens, the subway runs above the
streets.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,060
Below you can see different areas, each home
to people from around the world - Flushing:

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:54,660
Chinese and Koreans, Corona Heights: Central
and South Americans.

22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,260
At Grand Central Station I picked up two coffees.

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,980
Crowds of New Yorkers were hurrying out onto
42nd Street.

24
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:14,819
Then, like any other day, I walked the couple
of blocks to my office at 220, East 43rd Street.

25
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:21,689
My personal assistant, Stella Delgado, was
already at her desk opening the mail.

26
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,140
She's a smart, good-looking Puerto Rican who
understands everything about computers.

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,590
She's been with me for most of the time I've
been a private investigator.

28
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:40,299
Stella comes from Spanish Harlem, on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan - a part of the city

29
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,829
where tourists don't go.

30
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,980
On the streets there you'll hear more Spanish
than English.

31
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,749
She never finished school, but later, as an
adult, went to night school.

32
00:02:55,749 --> 00:03:02,900
She's worked hard for what she has now - a
job, comfortable home and loving family.

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,620
"How are you doing, Stella?"

34
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
I asked.

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,060
"I got coffee for you.

36
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,060
"Thanks.

37
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,569
I'm fine," she replied.

38
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,069
"Could you leave it on the desk?"

39
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,230
A knock at the door.

40
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,330
Two women entered.

41
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,090
One, a lady in her middle fifties, dressed
in a dark green suit.

42
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,760
The suit looked expensive, but she looked
worried.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,370
The other, a young woman in her twenties.

44
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,459
I compared their faces - they had to be mother
and daughter.

45
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,519
"Do I have the right place?" said the mother.

46
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,499
"This is the Marley Detective Agency?"

47
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:50,230
"That's correct, ma'am.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,819
The name's Nat Marley.

49
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,580
What can I do for you?"

50
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,059
I asked.

51
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:58,290
"Well, it's kind of difficult..."

52
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,680
she started.

53
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,720
"Come through to my office and take a seat,"
I said.

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,019
"Your names, please?"

55
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,560
"I'm Joyce O'Neill and this is my daughter,
Julia," said the mother.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,430
"It's about my husband, Patrick.

57
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,150
He's disappeared and I really need to find
him.

58
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,690
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

59
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,349
"I'm very sorry to hear that, ma'am," I said.

60
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:32,910
"Let's take it slowly, from the beginning."

61
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,759
She looked at me with large sad eyes.

62
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,990
"I haven't seen him since Saturday night.

63
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,060
When I woke up Sunday morning, he was gone.

64
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,889
He left this message on the kitchen table."

65
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,229
She took a postcard from her purse and read
to me:

66
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,360
"My dear Joyce.

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,830
Don't worry.

68
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm safe, but I can't come home.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,220
The thing is, I know something which puts
me and maybe you in danger.

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,500
Don't phone me, or my office or the NYPD.

71
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,930
If anyone asks for me, say I'm out of town.

72
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,789
Trust me.

73
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,870
Stay at Julia's place and wait for my call.

74
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,449
All my love.

75
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,449
Patrick."

76
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:28,300
"I have an apartment in Hamilton Heights,
near Columbia University," Julia explained.

77
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,130
"Mom has been staying with me there since
Sunday."

78
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,620
"Mr. Marley, I'm worried sick," Joyce O'Neill
continued.

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,159
"Patrick's never done anything like this before."

80
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,970
I knew it could be bad news when someone disappears.

81
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,180
But I didn't want to make her any more worried
than she was already.

82
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,710
"There can be many reasons why someone disappears,"
I said.

83
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,120
"Let's not expect the worst.

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,919
Did your husband call?"

85
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,170
She nodded.

86
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,990
"He's OK, but said he had to hide while he
decided what to do.

87
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,750
He wouldn't tell me what was happening.

88
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,050
He just said the less I knew, the safer I
would be.

89
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,569
I just don't know what to do."

90
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:25,340
"It sounds like he's in immediate danger,"
I said.

91
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:32,259
"It would be useful to know as much as possible
about your husband."

92
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,330
I learned that Patrick O'Neill worked as an
accountant.

93
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,379
His employer was a firm on Wall Street called
Ocean Star Finance.

94
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,760
He had worked there for over ten years.

95
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,690
His home address was Henry Street, Brooklyn
Heights.

96
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:58,620
His photograph showed a tall, gray-haired
guy with black metal glasses, but there was

97
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,370
nothing special about him.

98
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,960
He had been married for twenty-three years.

99
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,770
He was just an ordinary family man, with a
daughter studying for her MBA at Columbia

100
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,520
University.

101
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,759
"There must be a good reason why your husband
asked you not to call his office.

102
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,940
So tell me some more about his work," I said.

103
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,080
"Patrick's the second highest person in his
department," Joyce O'Neill answered.

104
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,039
"The head of department is Ronald Steinmann."

105
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,380
"What kind of guy is this Steinmann?"

106
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,830
I asked.

107
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:48,629
"He's good at his job - excellent in fact,
though he's not well liked.

108
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,389
Patrick and Steinmann aren't the best of friends."

109
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:57,629
"A few more questions, if you don't mind,"
I continued.

110
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:04,159
"Has your husband been acting strangely or
differently in any way?"

111
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,960
She thought carefully before answering.

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,310
"I can't say he has.

113
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,930
His work's really important to him.

114
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,540
He often has to work late, and he sometimes
brings work home - that's normal."

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,379
"I'm afraid I have to ask this.

116
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,229
Could there be another woman?"

117
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,230
I asked her.

118
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,969
She looked at me angrily, then said, "Sorry.

119
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,400
I guess it's your job to ask.

120
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,430
My husband has never even looked at another
woman."

121
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,940
"One final question," I said.

122
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,110
"It's useful to know how carefully a missing
person has planned to disappear.

123
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,230
Has your husband taken anything with him?

124
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,230
Did he pack clothes?

125
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,800
Did he take the car?"

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,180
"The car's gone, and he took a travel bag
with a change of clothes and some books,"

127
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,510
she replied.

128
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,050
"Thanks, ma'am.

129
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,810
You've been really helpful," I said.

130
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,800
"I'll do everything possible to find out what's
happened.

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,660
I'll need to visit you at your home later
to look at your husband's papers and computer.

132
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,670
That might give me some ideas.

133
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,740
Could you meet me there at three o'clock?"

134
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,920
After Mrs O'Neill and her daughter had left,
I looked out of the window.

135
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,290
The sun was trying to make the gray buildings
of East 43rd Street look beautiful.

136
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,990
It would need to try harder.

137
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:52,339
So a normal, hard-working guy had suddenly
disappeared.

138
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,899
He could be in serious trouble.

139
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,560
I had thought this was going to be another
ordinary day.

140
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,250
My mistake.

141
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,350
CHAPTER TWO
Wall Street

142
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,190
I told Stella what I'd learned so far.

143
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,209
As I talked, her fingers flew over the computer
keyboard.

144
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:23,860
"Take a look, Nat," she said.

145
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,750
"The latest information from the Ocean Star
Finance website."

146
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,160
It was an investment firm on Wall Street,
the financial center of America.

147
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,310
"Investment" meant lending out its clients'
money on international money markets to make

148
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,500
more money.

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,130
So their already rich clients became even
richer.

150
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:58,570
Also, it seemed to be one of the best firms
- a favorite of many famous New Yorkers.

151
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:05,240
Year after year Ocean Star had returned excellent
money to its clients.

152
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,959
It was like a money-making machine.

153
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,399
The head of the firm was Lorraine Houston.

154
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,260
She was well known to the public through TV
talk shows and magazine stories about her

155
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,110
homes on Long Island and in New England.

156
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,709
Her clothes only came from the best stores.

157
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:34,170
She'd lived the American Dream - the daughter
of a poor New Jersey family who had become

158
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,110
the president of Ocean Star.

159
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,010
I decided to call O'Neill's office and spoke
with his personal assistant.

160
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,610
I let her think I had some money to invest.

161
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:54,100
Of course, it wasn't the truth - I've never
had enough money to save much.

162
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,410
But after fifteen years in the NYPD, I'd learned
how to tell a good lie.

163
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,040
"This is Mr. Marley," I told her.

164
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,589
"I'd like to meet with Mr. O'Neill this afternoon.

165
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,110
I just wanted to check if he could see me
at three thirty."

166
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,329
"I'm sorry," said the personal assistant.

167
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,570
"Mr. O'Neill called this morning to say he
was sick."

168
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,570
"Really?

169
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,240
In that case, I'll have to speak to the head
of department," I said.

170
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,710
"I'm afraid that's not possible," she replied.

171
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,589
"You see, Mr. Steinmann doesn't work here
anymore.

172
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,070
He left the firm on Friday."

173
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,980
"Left the firm?"

174
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,680
I asked.

175
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
"Why?

176
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,389
Did he find another job?"

177
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:46,180
"I couldn't say, sir," replied the personal
assistant.

178
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,850
"Whose decision was this?"

179
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,850
I asked.

180
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,170
"I don't know," she said.

181
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,490
"Do you mean you don't know or you're not
allowed to tell me?"

182
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,490
I asked.

183
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:06,730
"As I said before, sir, I really couldn't
say," she said.

184
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,290
Something felt wrong.

185
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,329
Both the head guys in the department had gone?

186
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:18,300
Working at Ocean Star didn't seem too good
for your health.

187
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,200
Was it Steinmann's decision to leave?

188
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,320
You know what they say when someone suddenly
leaves a job?

189
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,639
"Did he jump or was he pushed?"

190
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,230
Stella was going through the mail.

191
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,190
I picked up the phone bill.

192
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,810
"Ouch!

193
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,829
That's going to hurt my wallet!"

194
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,100
I said.

195
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,930
"Did we really make that many calls?

196
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:53,420
Well, we'd better find Patrick O'Neill quickly
and make ourselves some money.

197
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,899
Come on, Stella.

198
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,220
We're going to visit Wall Street.

199
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,949
Let's see if we can find out anything more
on Ocean Star."

200
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:08,720
Some investigators take cabs everywhere.

201
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,190
Not me.

202
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,589
If possible, I take public transportation,
the New York subway.

203
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:22,980
It's cheap, fast and much safer than it used
to be when I was a cop.

204
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,089
We took a train from Grand Central Station
to Wall Street.

205
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,790
While traveling downtown, I described a plan
to Stella.

206
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,500
It was, of course, going to mean telling some
more lies.

207
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:45,540
"When we get to Ocean Star, we check in with
reception and let them think were millionaires

208
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,420
with money to invest.

209
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:55,770
We'll tell them we need financial advice and
ask to meet with one of their advisors immediately.

210
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,480
Let's see what they can offer us.

211
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,110
We'll act all unsure, and ask for promises
that our investment will be completely safe.

212
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:12,190
I'll do most of the talking and you watch
the advisor."

213
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:18,899
From the subway station, we walked east, past
the New York Stock Exchange.

214
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,610
Outside the building, tourists were busy taking
pictures.

215
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,610
Ahead of us we could see the full height of
the New Century Building.

216
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:35,910
Thirty floors of glass and metal, a wall of
silver in the sunshine.

217
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:42,519
Ocean Star Finance used the top four floors.

218
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,389
At the reception desk, you could almost smell
money in the air.

219
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:53,990
The black office furniture looked expensive
and the carpets were deep and soft.

220
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,019
A meeting was soon organized.

221
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:02,069
Yes, they wanted to talk to the millionaires.

222
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:07,670
It's true what people say - money does open
doors.

223
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,970
The advisor gave complete answers to my questions
and seemed to be sure of herself.

224
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:22,279
Finally I asked, "So you can promise us a
return of up to fifteen percent on our investment

225
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,389
by this time next year?

226
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,620
No problem?"

227
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,089
"None at all," she said immediately.

228
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,269
"You don't need to worry.

229
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:35,230
We offer the best service on Wall Street."

230
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,740
Afterwards, I asked Stella for her thoughts.

231
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:46,709
"You know, Nat, it was like listening to an
actor who'd learned her lines well," she said.

232
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,990
"She was giving the usual message: 'Don't
worry.

233
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,550
What could possibly go wrong?'

234
00:16:53,550 --> 00:17:00,829
But you know and I know that's not always
the case in the world of finance."

235
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:07,089
I told Stella I was going to take an early
lunch at McFadden's Bar to talk with the people

236
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,280
from the Daily News.

237
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,000
The information I needed to know about Ocean
Star couldn't be found on the internet.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,289
I wanted the inside information.

239
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:27,819
McFadden's, on the corner of East 42nd Street
and Second Avenue, was the second home of

240
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,010
Daily News reporters.

241
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,690
These guys often knew much more than they
could write about in their newspaper - the

242
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,220
kind of news that could be dangerous.

243
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,960
Inside the bar, the lunchtime crowd was beginning
to come in.

244
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,400
I looked around and saw a tall man with white
hair among a group of younger reporters.

245
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,520
He was Ed Winchester, a reporter who had been
with the Daily News longer than I could remember.

246
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,220
He had helped me several times in the past.

247
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,820
"Nat!

248
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,330
Over here.

249
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:15,940
And while you're at the bar, get me another
drink," he called, waving an empty glass.

250
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:23,530
I knew that the price of information from
Ed would be a beer, but that was cheap enough.

251
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,510
I ordered two beers and went over to Ed.

252
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,730
He had moved to an empty table and pushed
a chair toward me.

253
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,390
"Well, Nat, what brings you here?" he asked.

254
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:42,950
"You got that 'I need to know something' look
on your face."

255
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,700
I described what had happened during the morning
and what I already knew.

256
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,960
"It seems kind of strange to me.

257
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,920
One of the two head guys in the department
has suddenly left and the other has disappeared

258
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,159
on sick leave."

259
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,800
Ed thought carefully.

260
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:12,419
"Finance isn't my field, but there's a young
friend of mine who might be able to help."

261
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,270
He went over to the reporters and returned
with a guy in his twenties.

262
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:25,190
"Nat, I'd like to introduce Brett Johnson,
a financial reporter on the Wall Street page.

263
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,870
Brett, Mr. Marley needs anything you might
have on Ocean Star Finance."

264
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,169
"OK, Mr. Marley," Brett began.

265
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,290
"There are two sides to the story.

266
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,340
Each year, Ocean Star makes excellent money
for its clients.

267
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,210
How can they do it?

268
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,289
Is it just luck?

269
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,760
Or is Lorraine Houston really a financial
superwoman?

270
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,039
"Second, if Ocean Star can make such good
money, then why aren't all the other firms

271
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,370
on Wall Street doing the same thing?

272
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:07,330
However, I don't have all of the facts, so
that's why you haven't read about it."

273
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,860
"Thanks, Brett.

274
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:19,880
You've given me something to think about,"
I said.

275
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,120
CHAPTER THREE
Brooklyn Heights

276
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,179
After lunch I met Stella at Grand Central
Station by the information desk, under the

277
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,500
big clock.

278
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,590
We were going to see Joyce O'Neill at her
home on Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights.

279
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,679
As usual, we took the subway.

280
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,080
Henry Street is just one block away from the
subway station.

281
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,480
On either side of Henry Street are lines of
old brownstone houses, built in the nineteenth

282
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
century.

283
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,680
We walked in the sunshine to the house.

284
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,360
The O'Neills opened the door before I could
knock.

285
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Joyce O'Neill looked terrible - she was crying
and her eyes were red.

286
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,159
Julia was holding her mother's hand.

287
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:23,030
"Please come in," said Mrs. O'Neill.

288
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,610
As she was speaking, the phone rang.

289
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,950
She picked it up and said, "Joyce O'Neill
speaking."

290
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,270
Then she slowly put it down.

291
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,039
"Nobody there.

292
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,900
That's the third time today," she told me.

293
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,750
"I'll check that number if I may?"

294
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,270
I asked.

295
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,789
I called the service to find out who last
phoned.

296
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:56,539
As I expected, it refused to give me a number.

297
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:00,650
I didn't want to make Mrs. O'Neill any more
worried.

298
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,289
"No luck.

299
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:08,220
It wouldn't tell me anything - maybe just
a wrong number.

300
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,529
But if it happens again, tell me.

301
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:18,490
Now, this morning I called your husband's
office at Ocean Star - I let them think I

302
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,220
was a client.

303
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,970
I was told he was on sick leave.

304
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,360
And another thing.

305
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,090
Steinmann has left the firm.

306
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,799
I couldn't find out why."

307
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,919
"Really?" said Mrs. O'Neill.

308
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,690
"What on earth's going on?"

309
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,910
"I wish I knew," I said.

310
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:47,990
"While were here, we'd like to find out more
about your husband - his interests, what kind

311
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,750
of person he is.

312
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,070
You never know, any little thing could be
important.

313
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,260
Does he have a home office?"

314
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,779
"Sure, it's through here," said Mrs. O'Neill.

315
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,030
The room looked out onto the street.

316
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,850
On either side of the window were pictures
of old New York.

317
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:17,830
Under the window was a desk with nine drawers
and on the desk sat a computer.

318
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,770
On the other walls were bookshelves.

319
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,950
"Ms. Delgado will look through your husband's
computer files, if that's OK with you," I

320
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,390
told her.

321
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:37,059
Stella turned on the computer, but of course,
we needed the password.

322
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:43,250
Julia spelled it for Stella: "It's J-U-L-I-E.

323
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,559
That's what my father always calls me."

324
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:54,340
While Stella continued with the computer,
I began my search through the books.

325
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,700
They were of little interest to us.

326
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,130
Then I continued with the drawers of the desk.

327
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:07,590
Again, I discovered nothing that might help
us until I tried to open the final drawer

328
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,200
- it was locked.

329
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,860
But a minute's work with a small knife was
enough to open it.

330
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,380
It was full of books about card games, mainly
poker.

331
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:29,530
I read the titles: Ninety-nine Ways to Win
at Poker, Poker - Use Your Intelligence and

332
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:37,020
Win, The Complete Poker Player and so on.

333
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,309
O'Neill had read every book carefully.

334
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:46,620
On most pages there were notes in pencil - the
sort of notes that only a serious student

335
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,429
of the game would make.

336
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:53,640
Was he hiding the books from his wife?

337
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,380
I showed them to Mrs. O'Neill.

338
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,399
"Could you tell me if this is your husband's
handwriting?"

339
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,000
I asked.

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
"Yes, that's Patrick's," she replied.

341
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,340
"Did you realize that your husband was interested
in card games?"

342
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
I asked her.

343
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,080
"I had no idea.

344
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,760
It's a complete surprise.

345
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,179
That's something he never talked about.

346
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:28,460
And I thought I knew everything about him,"
she said sadly.

347
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,470
Stella opened O'Neill's email and I waited
patiently as she checked through all the information.

348
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,529
Finally, she was ready.

349
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:44,600
"Most of what I've opened here seems to be
quite normal," said Stella.

350
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,060
"Work letters mainly.

351
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:53,070
But there's something here - the last email
to Steinmann, sent on Friday afternoon.

352
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,080
It reads, 'I didn't think you could be so
stupid.

353
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,840
I can't believe what you've done.'"

354
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,049
"Do you have any idea what this could be about?"

355
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:07,460
I asked Mrs. O'Neill.

356
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,990
"It could be some kind of disagreement," she
replied.

357
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,720
Stella needed Mrs. O'Neill's help to get into
the family bank accounts.

358
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,650
She entered the numbers and soon the information
came up on the screen.

359
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:31,659
There was a joint account in the names of
Patrick and Joyce O'Neill, and also an account

360
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,910
in Joyce O'Neill's name.

361
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:40,720
The joint account seemed normal, as did Mrs.
O'Neill's account.

362
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,360
But we needed another password to open Patrick
O'Neill's account.

363
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,790
Mrs. O'Neill went straight to the kitchen
and returned with a little notebook.

364
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:56,110
"Patrick said I should keep this in a safe
place.

365
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:02,289
If anything happened to him, I'd be able to
find the information on the computer."

366
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:08,650
She passed the book to Stella, who searched
through it to find the necessary numbers.

367
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:14,610
New information came on the screen and Stella
now looked more serious.

368
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,559
"Mrs. O'Neill, do you know someone called
F. Van Zandt?"

369
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,559
she asked.

370
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,190
"I've never heard the name," she answered.

371
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,320
"Why?"

372
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,169
"Well, if you look here, there have been several
large payments to this Van Zandt over the

373
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:37,289
last six months," Stella explained.

374
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,360
Mrs. O'Neill looked at the screen and put
her hand to her mouth.

375
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,580
"I just don't understand," she said.

376
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,260
"This last payment is $15,000!

377
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,840
And look here.

378
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,210
Patrick took out $10,000 this morning."

379
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,170
"There's more," said Stella.

380
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,730
"Two large payments to Steinmann during the
past three months.

381
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,780
Over $25,000."

382
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,440
"I really can't understand it," said Mrs.
O'Neill.

383
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,860
"There must be a good reason," I said.

384
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,909
"Van Zandt's an unusual name, so I hope it
won't be too much trouble to find him - or

385
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,980
her."

386
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,190
I had a good idea what was going on.

387
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,630
O'Neill could be a secret poker player.

388
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:38,740
Those payments could mean that he'd lost heavily
at poker and was paying back the winner month

389
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,419
by month.

390
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:51,059
But why had he paid all that money to Steinmann?

391
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,290
CHAPTER FOUR
A voice from the past

392
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,769
Tuesday, October 5th.

393
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:04,380
Stella and I were at East 43rd Street early.

394
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,980
Now we had another person to find.

395
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,720
"Stella, see if you can find a phone number
for this Van Zandt," I asked.

396
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,850
"I'll look for a number for Steinmann."

397
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,450
My search was much faster than Stella's.

398
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:28,269
It was all there in the phone book - the number
and an address on West 75 th Street, on the

399
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,240
Upper West Side near Central Park.

400
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,490
You needed serious money to live in that part
of town.

401
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,830
I made the call.

402
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,830
"Good morning.

403
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,840
May I speak with Mr. Steinmann?"

404
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
I asked.

405
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,300
"Who are you and what's your business with
Mr. Steinmann?"

406
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,679
answered a loud voice.

407
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:56,170
A voice I knew very well - Captain Oldenberg
of the NYPD.

408
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,510
What was he doing there?

409
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,559
I wondered.

410
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,260
"Oldenberg!

411
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,299
Great to hear your voice again!"

412
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,299
I said.

413
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:05,630
"Remember me?

414
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,039
Nat Marley.

415
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,210
Why, it only seems like yesterday when we
used to be cops together."

416
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,240
Oldenberg didn't want to talk about old times.

417
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,260
"Just answer the question, Marley!" he shouted.

418
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,100
"OK, OK.

419
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,909
I'm making the call for a client.

420
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,210
Mr. Steinmann is the head of her husband's
department.

421
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,059
It's important that I speak with him."

422
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:38,090
"Very interesting," replied Oldenberg.

423
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,909
"That's going to be kind of difficult.

424
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:44,700
You see, Steinmann has disappeared.

425
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,159
Nobody's seen him since Friday.

426
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,550
How about you tell me what's going on?"

427
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,830
I knew I might need Oldenberg's help.

428
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,110
I told myself to be patient.

429
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,269
"My client's husband is in some kind of trouble,"
I said.

430
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:06,690
"I thought his boss could help with a few
questions."

431
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,470
"I get the picture," said Oldenberg.

432
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,940
"As usual, you can't tell me the full story.

433
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,840
But let me tell you this, Marley.

434
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,679
Don't try hiding information that could help
my investigation, or else I'll have you at

435
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,970
Police Headquarters for questioning."

436
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,140
Message received and understood.

437
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,380
Oldenberg was a good cop and was doing his
job.

438
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:43,770
But, as I knew from the old days with the
NYPD, he was neither the friendliest nor the

439
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,780
easiest guy to work with.

440
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,039
As soon as I put the phone down, it rang.

441
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,929
It was Mrs. O'Neill.

442
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:59,290
She had returned home to Henry Street to pick
up a change of clothes and she had found the

443
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,450
front door wide open.

444
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,429
Someone had broken into the house.

445
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:10,480
I remembered the calls that Mrs. O'Neill had
received yesterday.

446
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,700
Now I knew that someone was checking to see
when the house was empty.

447
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,970
"Is anything missing?"

448
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,190
I asked.

449
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,030
"I really don't know.

450
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,429
Please come quickly.

451
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:26,570
I'm so afraid they'll come back," she said.

452
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,000
"Don't touch anything," I told her.

453
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
"Can you wait with a neighbor?...

454
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,750
Good.

455
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,950
I'm on my way."

456
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,289
I left Stella looking for phone numbers for
Van Zandts.

457
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:45,590
I took another subway ride to Brooklyn Heights.

458
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,510
With the number of traffic lights between
Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn, the subway

459
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,330
was always faster.

460
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:59,120
I called Mrs. O'Neill's cellphone five minutes
before I arrived.

461
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,539
She was standing by the front door, her hands
shaking.

462
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,220
"Mr. Marley, this is just horrible.

463
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:13,210
It must be something to do with my poor Patrick,"
she cried.

464
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,950
She led me into the house.

465
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,760
Someone had made a complete mess of the home
office.

466
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,490
All the books were off the shelves, with their
pages open.

467
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,610
Empty desk drawers were lying on the carpet.

468
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:35,039
The computer was still there, but when I felt
around the back of the machine, it was open.

469
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,630
The hard drive was missing.

470
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,720
"Look here," I said.

471
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,630
"That's what they were looking for - information
on the hard drive.

472
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,690
But if they don't find what they're looking
for on the hard drive they could return and

473
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,440
you'll be in serious danger.

474
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,840
So I don't want you to return to this house
again."

475
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,990
"I'll stay at Julia's until this is over,"
Mrs O'Neill said sadly.

476
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,600
"OK.

477
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,220
We have to make sure this house is safe before
you leave," I said.

478
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,150
"I'll call a twenty-four hour lock service.

479
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,410
You'll need new, stronger locks.

480
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,660
I'll stay here while we wait."

481
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,430
I would probably have a couple of hours to
wait with Mrs. O'Neill.

482
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:31,290
It was a chance to ask a few more questions
and get a better picture of her husband.

483
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:36,060
I didn't think she realized how much danger
she could be in.

484
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,010
When would she agree to call the NYPD?

485
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:46,660
"Mrs. O'Neill, what can you tell me about
your husband's boss, Steinmann?"

486
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,050
I started.

487
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,220
"Yesterday you said they weren't the best
of friends."

488
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:58,350
"A couple of years ago, Patrick had the chance
to become the department head.

489
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,170
He was the right person for the job and he
was well liked.

490
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:08,300
Unfortunately, he didn't get the job, though
that wasn't his fault.

491
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:14,810
Lorraine Houston, the president, wanted someone
fresh and new from outside.

492
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,050
She preferred the kind of guy who didn't care
if he wasn't liked.

493
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,520
So Steinmann got the job.

494
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,670
Patrick continued with his work as best as
he could, but there was no friendship between

495
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,010
him and Steinmann."

496
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,570
"Thanks.

497
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,100
That's useful to know.

498
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,170
Has your husband always lived in Brooklyn?"

499
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,850
I went on.

500
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,100
"No.

501
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,500
We moved here when Julia was just a kid.

502
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,060
Patrick's family are Irish-American.

503
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,360
His grandparents arrived in the U.S. from
Dublin in the 1920s.

504
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:55,300
They more or less got off the ship and moved
straight to the East Village.

505
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,770
Patrick grew up in Alphabet City, on 10th
Street."

506
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:06,310
Alphabet City is the part of the East Village
which gets its name from Avenues A, B, C and

507
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,340
D, which cut across it.

508
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,440
It didn't use to be a safe area.

509
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,360
In fact, it was a center for drugs and crime.

510
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,010
But now things have changed.

511
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,640
Today you can find cool cafes, bars and stores
in the area.

512
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,330
"So he didn't come from a rich family?"

513
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,330
I asked.

514
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,680
"Not at all.

515
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,170
Patrick's parents had a hard life.

516
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,300
They never lived the American Dream.

517
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,140
It wasn't easy for Patrick, either.

518
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,380
He's the youngest of six children, so there
was no question of the family paying for college.

519
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:53,150
Patrick did it the hard way and paid for everything
by working nights at a 24/7 store.

520
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,010
He never had the advantages that I had."

521
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,460
"Where do you think he might hide to escape
from somebody?"

522
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
I asked.

523
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,100
"Where would he feel safest in this city?"

524
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,310
"I couldn't say for sure.

525
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:12,960
But the area he knows best of all is the East
Village," she replied.

526
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,210
"Right.

527
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:21,060
Now, Mrs. O'Neill, I don't want to worry you
more than necessary, but I think you're in

528
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,020
real danger.

529
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,840
The people that broke into your house could
come back.

530
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,400
I think we should call the NYPD."

531
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,020
Mrs. O'Neill got up from her armchair, walked
over to the window and looked out into the

532
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,540
street.

533
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:46,920
At last she spoke: "Mr. Marley, I know you're
offering the best advice.

534
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,600
But you remember what Patrick said in his
message: 'Don't call the NYPD.'

535
00:37:52,600 --> 00:38:03,280
Those are his wishes, and I have to follow
them."

536
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,010
CHAPTER FIVE
Death by the Hudson River

537
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,320
It was midday before I got back to East 43rd
Street.

538
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,170
I picked up a snack at Grand Central Station
before returning to the office.

539
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:24,510
It hadn't taken Stella long to find phone
numbers for Van Zandts.

540
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,130
There were over fifty in all of New York City.

541
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,450
"OK, Stella.

542
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,140
We can share this job," I said.

543
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,810
"I'll take the first phone book and you can
start on the second.

544
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:43,270
Say you're an old friend of O'Neill's and
that you're trying to find him."

545
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:50,780
It was slow and boring work, but I felt it
would be worth it in the end.

546
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
"Good afternoon.

547
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,040
Is this Mr. Van Zandt?

548
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,190
If I could have a minute of your time?...

549
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,280
You see, I'm trying to find an old friend
of mine, Patrick O'Neill...

550
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,710
Would you know him?...

551
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,710
No?

552
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,710
OK.

553
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,380
Thanks for your time."

554
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,800
As the calls continued, I wasn't feeling too
hopeful.

555
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,280
Then I got an answering machine.

556
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,640
I listened to the message: "I'm sorry I can't
get to the phone right now.

557
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:26,020
Leave a message or phone 212-555-01230."

558
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,320
I called the number.

559
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,040
The phone was answered after a couple of rings.

560
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,930
First the sound of jazz music, then a voice:
"Frankie's Cocktail Lounge."

561
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,120
"Good afternoon.

562
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,270
Is that Mr. Van Zandt?"

563
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,280
I asked.

564
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,290
"Hold on..."

565
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:48,660
I heard the guy shout above the noise, "Frank!

566
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,380
Call for you."

567
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,770
Could this finally be the right Van Zandt?

568
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,390
I waited patiently.

569
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,670
"Frank Van Zandt speaking."

570
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:04,510
"If I could have a moment of your time, Mr.
Van Zandt," I began.

571
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:10,530
"I've lost the phone number and address of
an old friend, Patrick O'Neill.

572
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,740
Would you know how I could find him?"

573
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,360
"Oh yeah?

574
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,980
I might.

575
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,610
Who's asking?"

576
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,300
replied Van Zandt.

577
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,430
Not very welcoming, I thought.

578
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,430
Time to tell another lie.

579
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,300
"The name's Marley.

580
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm an old college friend.

581
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,030
Patrick and I were at accounting school together."

582
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,900
"If you're so clever, mister, look in the
phone book.

583
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,330
And don't call again," he added, then put
the phone down.

584
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:48,950
The line went dead - clearly this guy didn't
like me asking after O'Neill.

585
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,220
This time I felt I was in luck.

586
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,740
Perhaps I should visit Frankie's Cocktail
Lounge.

587
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,760
Before I could organize anything, the phone
rang.

588
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,530
I picked it up and heard that voice from the
past again - Captain Oldenberg.

589
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,600
"Marley!" he shouted.

590
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,700
"Your line's been busy for ages.

591
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,490
Could I have a minute of your valuable time?"

592
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,490
"Sure.

593
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,840
Go ahead."

594
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,060
I replied, holding the phone away from my
ear.

595
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,260
"Get yourself to the 79th Street Boat Basin.

596
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,460
I got something to show you."

597
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,890
He laughed.

598
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,910
When Oldenberg laughs, it usually means bad
news.

599
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,910
"OK.

600
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,180
But why?

601
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,040
What's going on?"

602
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
I asked.

603
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,130
"It's a surprise.

604
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,030
But I want you here now," Oldenberg ordered.

605
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,520
I told Stella what was happening.

606
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,220
She gave me a smile and said, "Don't get mad
at Oldenberg.

607
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,600
Remember, we may need his help."

608
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,050
I was back on the subway again, this time
to West 79th Street.

609
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:04,550
I walked the two blocks from the subway station
west toward the Hudson River, and crossed

610
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,950
the Riverside Park to the boat basin.

611
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,960
From here you could see across the river to
New Jersey.

612
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,040
The temperature had dropped and the sky was
full of heavy gray clouds.

613
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,430
A cold wind started to blow from the west.

614
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,610
All around the boat basin were houseboats.

615
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,770
I've heard it's the cheapest way to live in
this city.

616
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:34,010
Ahead I could see NYPD cars in a parking lot
near the river.

617
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,920
As I got closer, an NYPD cop stopped me and
said, "Sorry, sir.

618
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,680
You can't enter.

619
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,660
"The name's Marley.

620
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,670
Captain Oldenberg's expecting me," I replied.

621
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,670
"OK.

622
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,920
Come with me and we'll find the captain,"
said the cop.

623
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,520
Oldenberg was standing in the parking lot
behind a Chevrolet Impala.

624
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,680
He was smiling, which always made me feel
uncomfortable.

625
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,770
"Take a look at this," said Oldenberg, waving
at the car.

626
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:13,680
Oldenberg moved to the back of the car and
opened the trunk.

627
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,720
Inside was a dead man.

628
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,430
Oldenberg called to the police doctor.

629
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,690
"Could you show me his face again, Doc?" he
asked.

630
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,290
"OK, Marley, time for your surprise!

631
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:35,810
The NYPD doctor was wearing a suit of white
material over her clothes, and white plastic

632
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,140
gloves and shoes.

633
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,940
She carefully took the dead man's head in
her hands and moved it round so we could see

634
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,770
the face.

635
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,810
His skin was gray and his mouth was open.

636
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,370
Between his eyes was a hole.

637
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,700
"Marley, meet Ronald Steinmann.

638
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:00,120
Doc, would you tell Mr. Marley what you know?"
said Oldenberg.

639
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,920
"I'd say he's been dead about two or three
days.

640
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,930
A single shot to the head.

641
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,180
You see these cuts around his face?

642
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,800
This guy was hit hard a number of times before
he died.

643
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,110
Can't tell you much more just now," the police
doctor told me.

644
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,450
Heavy rain began to fall.

645
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,880
I was feeling sick.

646
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,770
Although I've seen dead bodies before, I still
get that same horrible feeling.

647
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,820
"I just checked the license plate.

648
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,280
This car belongs to Mr. Patrick O'Neill, Henry
Street, Brooklyn.

649
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,140
We need to talk, Marley," said Oldenberg.

650
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,370
"And I guess you need a drink.

651
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:47,370
Let's go somewhere warmer."

652
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,880
Oldenberg took me to the Boat Basin Cafe,
where he ordered me a double Scotch.

653
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,310
The drink was just the right medicine.

654
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,450
"Marley, I got an idea and I think I may be
right.

655
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:07,880
Your client could be Patrick O'Neill, an accountant
with Ocean Star Finance?

656
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,120
Or one of his family?" he asked.

657
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,160
I nodded.

658
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,280
The safest thing was to listen and see what
Oldenberg wanted.

659
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,650
"Steinmann disappeared some time on Friday
afternoon.

660
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,650
I've been asking questions at Ocean Star.

661
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,600
On Friday morning, people heard Steinmann
and O'Neill arguing.

662
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,710
This was no conversation between friends.

663
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,220
People said it was more like a fight.

664
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:44,240
It was behind closed doors so they couldn't
say what they were arguing about.

665
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,830
Today Steinmann is found in O'Neill's car,
murdered.

666
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,750
At the same time nobody seems to know where
O'Neill is.

667
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,760
You see where this is leading?"

668
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,680
I understood very well.

669
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,530
The sick feeling in my stomach started to
get stronger.

670
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,060
"I'm talking murder, Marley.

671
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:14,310
I want to question Patrick O'Neill about the
murder of Ronald Steinmann.

672
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,970
I want to know why O'Neill was paying money
into Steinmann's account.

673
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:25,200
Also, the reason why O'Neill had sent him
an angry email.

674
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,890
It began, 'I didn't think you could be so
stupid.'

675
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:35,670
That means I have to find him and I believe
you know where he is.

676
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:41,050
You used to be a cop, Marley, so you know
the way the police work.

677
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:46,420
If you refuse to tell me, that's a crime."

678
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,290
I held my head in my hands.

679
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,690
I could only tell Oldenberg the truth.

680
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,640
That wouldn't be what he wanted to hear.

681
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,250
"Believe me, Oldenberg, I'm being completely
straight with you.

682
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,430
I have no idea where O'Neill is.

683
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,190
Yes, my client is his wife.

684
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,540
All she knows is that her husband is hiding
somewhere."

685
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,850
"OK.

686
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,630
Another thing, Marley.

687
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:20,410
I have to question Mrs. O'Neill, but I can't
find her.

688
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,570
I just get the answering machine every time
I call.

689
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,290
I need your help," said Oldenberg.

690
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,210
"OK, Oldenberg.

691
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:35,500
I'll see what I can do," I replied.

692
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:41,720
On the journey back to East 43rd Street, I
thought about the information I already knew.

693
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,780
I took a fresh page in my notebook and wrote
down the facts I knew for sure and the questions

694
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,710
that needed answers.

695
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,080
I knew O'Neill had disappeared sometime between
Saturday night and Sunday morning.

696
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,480
He didn't like his boss, Steinmann, and on
Friday he'd argued with him.

697
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,750
Also, he had sent an angry email to Steinmann.

698
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,300
O'Neill had made large payments to Steinmann
and Van Zandt.

699
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,320
He was interested in poker.

700
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,080
Someone had broken into his house and stolen
the hard drive of his computer.

701
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:27,960
Now the police had found Steinmann dead in
the trunk of O'Neill's car.

702
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,220
What was I less sure about?

703
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,400
What did O'Neill know which put him in danger?

704
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,980
Had Steinmann known the same thing?

705
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,510
Had O'Neill lost heavily at poker?

706
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,060
Was Ocean Star in difficulties?

707
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:51,510
What could explain those payments to Steinmann
and Van Zandt?

708
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,250
And finally, could a guy like O'Neill kill?

709
00:48:55,250 --> 00:49:03,950
The more I thought about it, Ocean Star had
to be the key to all the questions.

710
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,770
I called Mrs. O'Neill at her daughter's apartment.

711
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:13,730
"You said that your husband took his car when
he disappeared," I said.

712
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,470
"That's right.

713
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,670
It's not parked in the street," she replied.

714
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:23,200
"I'm afraid I have some terrible news.

715
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,010
This morning, Steinmann's body was found in
the trunk of your husband's car.

716
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,780
I heard a scream over the phone, then nothing.

717
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,460
"Are you still there?"

718
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,690
I asked.

719
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,420
"Yes," she replied quietly.

720
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,220
"This is just awful.

721
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,530
I can't believe it.

722
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,250
So what happens now?"

723
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:54,290
"The police are now looking for your husband,"
I explained.

724
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:59,460
"I'm sorry, but you'll have to talk to the
police."

725
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,010
"I realize I don't have any choice," replied
Mrs. O'Neill.

726
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,630
"But there's one condition.

727
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:17,040
The meeting should be at your office on East
43rd Street."

728
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,900
CHAPTER SIX
Questions and answers

729
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,900
Wednesday, October 6th.

730
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,170
Captain Oldenberg and Mrs. O'Neill were in
my office at nine o'clock.

731
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:37,000
Mrs. O'Neill was wearing a very fashionable
black jacket and skirt with a white blouse.

732
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,090
Maybe she did her shopping on Fifth Avenue.

733
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:46,460
Oldenberg was dressed in an ugly brown suit
with an orange tie - clothes that had been

734
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,500
in fashion sometime during the last century.

735
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:57,900
Before Oldenberg started questioning Mrs.
O'Neill, I told him what I knew about Patrick

736
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,090
O'Neill.

737
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:06,670
I was trying to show the captain that O'Neill
was just a good ordinary guy, not a murderer.

738
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:13,670
"As I see it, Patrick O'Neill could be in
the middle of something very dangerous," I

739
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,670
began.

740
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:20,380
"So far, we have no clear idea of what that
might be.

741
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:26,330
We can't be sure if the key to this case is
Ocean Star or something that happened between

742
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,080
O'Neill and Steinmann - or both.

743
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,450
"Let's move on to O'Neill, the person.

744
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:41,490
We have a happily- married family man who's
worked for the same employer for over ten

745
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,770
years.

746
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,730
In that time he's risen to be second in his
department.

747
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,480
He's given years of his life to the firm.

748
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,790
Also, he has no criminal history."

749
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,600
Oldenberg started to question Mrs. O'Neill.

750
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:05,890
As I thought, his main interest was the argument
between O'Neill and Steinmann.

751
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:13,830
"Mrs. O'Neill," said Oldenberg, "I was told
at Ocean Star that your husband and Steinmann

752
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,870
argued on Friday before they both disappeared.

753
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:23,850
We don't know what it was about, but people
heard Mr. O'Neill shouting.

754
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,880
Would you say they worked well together?"

755
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,470
"It was never easy for Patrick," she replied.

756
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:34,810
"Steinmann pushed people hard.

757
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,050
Second best was never good enough for him.

758
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:43,190
I can't say Patrick liked him, but he did
his work as well as he could."

759
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:48,170
"Two years ago, your husband had the chance
to become the department head.

760
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,250
But Lorraine Houston brought in Steinmann.

761
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:56,530
How did your husband feel about this?" asked
Oldenberg.

762
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:01,950
"At the time he was angry, but he learned
to accept what had happened.

763
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:05,310
Life has to go on," Mrs. O'Neill replied.

764
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,770
"Could you think of anybody who would want
to kill Steinmann?"

765
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,340
Oldenberg asked her.

766
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,950
"No," she replied.

767
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:19,720
"OK, so he's not the nicest of guys, but that's
no reason for murder."

768
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,750
"Your husband was paying money to Steinmann.

769
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,560
Do you have any idea why?"

770
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,630
Oldenberg went on.

771
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:33,280
"None at all," Mrs. O'Neill replied.

772
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,920
Oldenberg continued with questions about the
angry email, which Mrs. O'Neill answered patiently.

773
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,500
At last, he said, "One more thing, Mrs. O'Neill.

774
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,270
Would you agree to a search of your house?"

775
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:53,320
"I guess I have to," she replied, and handed
him her keys.

776
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,760
"Go ahead and do it."

777
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,830
"Thanks," he said.

778
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,980
"If I'm going to get any further with this
case, I must find him.

779
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,350
Will you call him?"

780
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:12,170
Mrs. O'Neill looked him straight in the eyes
and said, "That's impossible.

781
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,900
Patrick only calls me from pay phones."

782
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,770
"Patrick O'Neill is wanted for murder," Oldenberg
said.

783
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:28,090
"And if you, Marley, or you, Mrs. O'Neill,
know where he is, and refuse to tell me, that's

784
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,480
a crime.

785
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,860
You could both find yourselves in jail."

786
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,440
Mrs. O'Neill looked angrily at Oldenberg.

787
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,790
If looks could kill, he would be a dead man.

788
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:47,300
After Oldenberg had left the building, Mrs.
O'Neill started to cry.

789
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,250
"I'm sure Patrick has nothing to do with Steinmann's
murder," she said.

790
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,690
"But what if the police don't believe me?

791
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:00,540
And what if the people who killed Steinmann
go after Patrick next?"

792
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,710
"I will find him, I promise you," I said.

793
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,850
"But you must be careful.

794
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,890
When you get back to Julia's apartment, stay
inside, OK?

795
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:18,180
Stella, could you call a cab for Mrs. O'Neill?"

796
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:23,940
When Mrs. O'Neill had left, I organized some
help from an old friend who used to be a policeman

797
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,900
like myself.

798
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,700
A guy who was as useful as ten NYPD officers
- Joe Blaney.

799
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,180
He'd taught me more about staying alive on
the streets of Manhattan than you could ever

800
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,230
learn at Police Academy.

801
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:44,970
He's the sort of person you needed if there
was going to be trouble and he knew how to

802
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,080
use a gun.

803
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,920
I last carried a gun when I was a New York
cop.

804
00:55:50,920 --> 00:56:00,490
I haven't carried one since and haven't wanted
to - but there are times when one is necessary.

805
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,490
I picked up the phone.

806
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,210
"Joe, I have work for you.

807
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,530
It could be dangerous, so bring a gun.

808
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:13,420
A missing person's in danger, and we're going
to find him.

809
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:25,060
Come to East 43rd Street with your car, as
soon as you can."

810
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,860
CHAPTER SEVEN
Frankies Cocktail Lounge

811
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:35,900
The plan was that Joe and I would pay a visit
to Van Zandt and see if he could lead us to

812
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,000
O'Neill.

813
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,690
Meanwhile, Mrs. O'Neill would come back to
the office that afternoon and stay with Stella.

814
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:48,530
Joe Blaney arrived in his car soon after midday.

815
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:56,040
He's in his middle-sixties, but he's tall
and slim with a full head of white hair.

816
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:02,040
Although he's probably twenty years older
than me, I'd say he looks younger.

817
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,990
Some guys have all the luck.

818
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,860
In the car, Joe pulled his jacket to one side
to show me the gun.

819
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:15,950
"Let's hope we don't have to use this, boss,"
he said.

820
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,500
We drove downtown on Second Avenue toward
4th Street.

821
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,570
The traffic wasn't too heavy and we soon arrived
in the East Village.

822
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:33,230
We went straight along 4th Street to Avenue
A. Frankie's Cocktail Lounge was on 5th Street,

823
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:34,240
between Avenues A and B.

824
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,800
Joe stopped the car.

825
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:46,050
Above the double doors, I could read the words:
"Frankie's - Cold Drinks, Warm People, Hot

826
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,690
Sounds".

827
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:52,490
"Let's do it," I said.

828
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:55,870
We went into Frankie's and sat at a table.

829
00:57:55,870 --> 00:58:01,720
At first, it seemed almost dark, but soon
I could see better.

830
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:08,640
It was a comfortable room with armchairs,
sofas, red carpets and the sound of jazz guitar

831
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,420
music.

832
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:17,290
We needed clear heads so we ordered two coffees,
not the Cocktail Specials.

833
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:23,460
There were no customers at the bar, so I had
a look at who was working behind it.

834
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,900
A couple of bartenders and someone who I guessed
must be the boss.

835
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:35,470
He was medium height with a short black beard,
but without a single hair on his head.

836
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:41,500
"I think we've found Van Zandt," I said, looking
toward the bar.

837
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,610
"We'll try and have a little talk."

838
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:48,570
I walked over to the bar with Joe.

839
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:52,130
Van Zandt looked up from some papers he was
checking.

840
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,410
"Would you be Mr. Van Zandt?"

841
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,510
I asked.

842
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,720
"That's me," he replied.

843
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,750
"What can I do for you?"

844
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,650
"Could I talk to you about Patrick O'Neill?"

845
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,650
I asked.

846
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,530
"Who are you?"

847
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:13,560
Van Zandt asked carefully and gave me a cold,
hard look.

848
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,570
"Nat Marley, licensed private investigator,"
I said.

849
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,420
"I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.

850
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,000
I believe you know O'Neill.

851
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,680
His wife's very worried about him and I think
you could help."

852
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,790
"I don't have to talk to you!" he said angrily.

853
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,990
Suddenly a big strong bartender was standing
in front of me.

854
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,970
"You got a problem, boss?" he asked Van Zandt.

855
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,220
"It's OK," I said quietly.

856
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,310
"We're not looking for trouble.

857
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:54,340
Look, take my cellphone and press 'Call'.

858
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,410
You'll get my office.

859
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:00,250
Ask to talk with O'Neill's wife."

860
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:07,300
Van Zandt did as I said and spent a couple
of minutes checking facts with Mrs. O'Neill.

861
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:12,310
After a while he returned the cellphone and
said, "OK.

862
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,080
What do you want?"

863
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,890
He waved the bartender away and led us to
a room behind the bar.

864
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:25,340
Inside, the air didn't smell too fresh - old
cigarette smoke.

865
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,680
Van Zandt found chairs and sat us at a round
table.

866
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,430
I introduced Joe, then began questioning Van
Zandt.

867
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,160
"I believe that O'Neill has paid you a lot
of money?"

868
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,210
I asked.

869
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:42,860
"You're not stealing from him, I hope."

870
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,880
"It's not robbery," replied Van Zandt.

871
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,900
"That's what I won fairly in a poker game.

872
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,760
It works both ways.

873
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,250
Patrick's an excellent player and I've paid
him thousands when I lost.

874
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,350
We're old friends.

875
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:05,930
I've known him since we were both kids, working
nights at a 24/7 store."

876
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,040
"So explain this," I continued.

877
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:15,910
"Why does a Wall Street accountant come to
a back room in the East Village to play poker?"

878
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:23,530
"I've met several guys like Patrick - hard-working
family men who earn good money.

879
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:26,470
But they want a little more from life.

880
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:31,200
Maybe they're just bored so I give them a
good time.

881
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:38,480
I know organizing back-room poker games is
a crime, but I'm not hurting anybody.

882
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:44,240
These guys have the money - like Patrick's
boss, Steinmann.

883
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,160
I'm just offering them a service."

884
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,240
"So O'Neill brought Steinmann here?"

885
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,750
I asked Van Zandt in surprise.

886
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,750
"Yeah.

887
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,550
Once or twice.

888
01:01:56,550 --> 01:02:02,190
I don't think Patrick really wanted to, but
I guess he couldn't refuse.

889
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:05,910
One night we all lost heavily to Steinmann.

890
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:10,280
He played like poker was his second profession.

891
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,860
I had to ask Patrick not to bring him again.

892
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,300
It would hurt my bank account too much."

893
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:24,560
Van Zandt had answered two questions - why
O'Neill had made payments to both himself

894
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,890
and Steinmann.

895
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,350
"OK.

896
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,540
Let's forget the money," I said.

897
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,450
"I'm really interested in finding O'Neill.

898
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,280
You know he's in some kind of trouble?"

899
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:43,390
"After reading about Steinmann's murder in
the morning papers, I had a good idea what

900
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:46,840
the trouble could be," replied Van Zandt.

901
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,940
"Patrick got here soon after midnight, Sunday
morning.

902
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,410
He said he was in danger, but he wouldn't
talk about it.

903
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:00,900
He needed to hide someplace for a few days
and was going to check into a hotel around

904
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,920
here.

905
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,860
He also told me to keep quiet if anyone came
asking questions.

906
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:13,750
And one last thing - he told me to expect
a letter from his firm.

907
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:18,150
He said it was really important and I should
keep it for him."

908
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:23,960
"If it's arrived, could we take a look?"

909
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,960
I asked.

910
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,880
"I guess I could show you," he said.

911
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,140
It was a thick envelope with the address written
in O'Neill's handwriting.

912
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:37,500
I took out my pocket knife and cut it open.

913
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:43,760
Inside, I found some papers - probably about
twenty pages.

914
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:51,270
At the top of each page I could see the words
"Ocean Star Finance" in red and gold letters.

915
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:55,270
On every page, there were lines of numbers.

916
01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:00,360
"You know what this is?" asked Van Zandt.

917
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:06,430
"I guess some sort of accounts from Ocean
Star," I said.

918
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:13,520
"Another guess - this information may have
something to do with Steinmann's murder.

919
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,340
Mr. Van Zandt, I'd like to thank you for your
help.

920
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:20,610
We may be able to reach O'Neill in time.

921
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:26,590
I don't think anyone else knows these papers
are here, so could you keep them in a safe

922
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:29,480
place?"

923
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:34,260
Before Joe and I started searching the East
Village, I called Stella to tell her what

924
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,110
we'd discovered so far.

925
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,360
When I'd finished, Stella said, "Mrs. O'Neill
wants to speak with you."

926
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:47,320
"Mr. Marley, thank you," said Mrs. O'Neill.

927
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,270
"You're getting close to Patrick, I can feel
it.

928
01:04:51,270 --> 01:05:01,730
Please find him and make the police believe
that my husband is no killer."

929
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:06,010
CHAPTER EIGHT
The East Village

930
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:12,690
Our search area was wide - everything between
Fourth Avenue and Avenue D, then everything

931
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:17,630
between East Houston Street and East 14th
Street.

932
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:23,040
Within that area are fourteen streets and
eight avenues.

933
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,300
Now do the math - that makes around eighty
blocks.

934
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:34,800
The good news was that if O'Neill was staying
in a hotel in the area, like Van Zandt said,

935
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,350
we didn't have too many places to check.

936
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:43,160
Most of the hotels are either along Third
Avenue or the streets off it.

937
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,820
There were two problems.

938
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:50,100
First, what sort of hotel would O'Neill choose?

939
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,630
Somewhere busy, on a crowded street where
he wouldn't be noticed?

940
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:58,231
Or would he prefer somewhere quieter and more
basic, with less activity?

941
01:05:58,231 --> 01:06:03,670
A place where it would be easier to watch
and listen.

942
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:08,030
Second, how would we find out if he was staying
there?

943
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:13,400
Would he check in under his own name and how
could we get the hotel receptionist to tell

944
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,150
us if he was there?

945
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:22,230
Hotel receptionists don't give information
about their guests to complete strangers.

946
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:27,370
So we had a plan - I'd say I had a business
meeting with O'Neill.

947
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:33,130
To help receptionists believe the story, I'd
asked Stella to produce some company information

948
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:36,390
for "Patrick O'Neill Accounting".

949
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:41,510
There was a photo of O'Neill on the front,
which I'd hold so the receptionist could see

950
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:43,730
his face.

951
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:49,310
Time after time at hotels I introduced myself
and spoke to the receptionists.

952
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,830
"Excuse me, my name's Marley.

953
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:54,340
I have a meeting with Patrick O'Neill.

954
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,150
Would you call his room to tell him 'I'm at
reception?"

955
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:06,170
We had no luck at the more expensive places,
which were full of tourists and business people.

956
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:12,460
After asking at a few, we knew what sort of
answers to expect: "I'm sorry, sir.

957
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,210
Do you have the correct hotel?...

958
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:19,330
I wish I could help you, but..."

959
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:23,130
Hour after hour, our search area grew wider.

960
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:29,010
We had moved away from Third Avenue, deeper
into the center of the East Village, toward

961
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,790
Alphabet City.

962
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:37,600
At some of the cheaper places, the receptionists
were less patient: "We got nobody by that

963
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,740
name staying here, mister...

964
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,770
Look, mister, I just work here.

965
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:47,000
It's not my job to remember faces."

966
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,160
We continued until early evening.

967
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:57,320
It was six thirty, not long before sunset,
and the sky in the west was growing pink.

968
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:02,800
We just had one or two more places to check
in Alphabet City.

969
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:09,780
The next hotel, the Madigan Inn on Avenue
B, looked like an ugly, dirty place, but the

970
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,660
receptionist was helpful.

971
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:18,810
I asked the usual questions and made sure
that she could see O'Neill's photo.

972
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:24,750
Then the surprise - I could see from the look
on her face that she knew something.

973
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:27,839
"Sure I know the guy," she said.

974
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,660
"But not by the name of O'Neill.

975
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,940
I don't know if I'm allowed to say..."

976
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:39,900
I showed her my investigator's license and
said, "The truth is, this guy's life is in

977
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,049
danger.

978
01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:47,790
I'm working for his family and we need to
find him quickly, before someone else does."

979
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,150
She believed me and turned to check the computer.

980
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:54,480
"Yeah, there he is," she said.

981
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,380
"He stayed for one night and checked out yesterday.

982
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,109
The name he gave was Brendan Touhey."

983
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:04,010
"Can you tell me anything more?"

984
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,010
I asked.

985
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,020
"Did he have any visitors?

986
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,529
How did he spend his time?"

987
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:13,350
"Well, he asked for a room on the street.

988
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,600
That seemed to be important.

989
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,810
He didn't have any visitors and spent most
of the time in his room.

990
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,100
I think he was watching the street.

991
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:26,620
Or that's what I thought when I looked up
at his window."

992
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,420
"Thanks," I said.

993
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,089
"You've been really helpful."

994
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:34,020
"You could ask at our other hotel," she said.

995
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,650
"I could phone ahead to tell them to expect
you.

996
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:42,730
It's the Metro, on Avenue C between 4th and
3rd."

997
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,730
"Please.

998
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:47,470
If you would," I replied.

999
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:52,580
As we left, I said to Joe, "At last we're
getting somewhere.

1000
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,600
I think I know what he's doing.

1001
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,710
Just staying a night at one place, then moving
on."

1002
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:04,530
Joe suddenly stopped in front of the door
to the street.

1003
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,990
"Nat, you see that car just across the street?"

1004
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:09,590
"The black one?"

1005
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,650
I asked.

1006
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:11,710
"That's it.

1007
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:14,000
I think I've seen it before.

1008
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,810
Outside your office, but I couldn't be too
sure," Joe went on.

1009
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,040
I studied the car carefully.

1010
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:26,460
A Lexus, which costs serious money.

1011
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,280
Three guys with dark glasses were inside.

1012
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:36,770
It was starting to get dark and I've never
liked guys who wear sunglasses at night.

1013
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:42,400
I had a horrible feeling that those people
meant trouble.

1014
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,720
Then the driver looked toward us and the car
quickly moved along the avenue.

1015
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,230
In the poor light, I couldn't read the license
plate.

1016
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:54,580
"What do you think, boss?" asked Joe.

1017
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:57,670
"Are they following us:

1018
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,630
The streetlights had now come on.

1019
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:05,520
Under their yellow light I could see the answer
to Joe's question.

1020
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,970
On the road beside Joe's car was a knife.

1021
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:16,940
There was no air in two of the tires so it
was impossible to drive.

1022
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,690
Now I realized what was happening.

1023
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:25,980
Those guys had followed us, hoping we would
lead them to O'Neill.

1024
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:32,040
They knew we were checking hotels, and the
Metro was the last one in the area.

1025
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,800
They wanted to make sure they got there first.

1026
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:42,150
We ran across to Avenue C, but we were losing
valuable time.

1027
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:47,440
The Metro, like the last hotel, looked as
if nobody cared for it.

1028
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,390
The receptionist, though, was friendly and
welcomed us with a smile.

1029
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:55,070
"Hi, I'm Gina," she said.

1030
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,240
"You guys didn't need to hurry.

1031
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,240
We got-"

1032
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:02,880
I stopped her and said, "The receptionist
at the Madigan just phoned ahead and told

1033
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,510
you to expect us.

1034
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,690
We're looking for Patrick O'Neill.

1035
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:09,670
He's in danger and might be using a different
name.

1036
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,190
Has anyone asked for him?"

1037
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,750
I showed her O'Neill's photograph.

1038
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,720
"Oh yes," said Gina.

1039
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,870
"He's staying here, but under the name of
Bernard Delaney.

1040
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,870
Nice, quiet guy.

1041
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,920
He stays in his room most of the time.

1042
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,660
There's something I don't understand.

1043
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:32,220
You're the second group of people asking about
him.

1044
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:36,510
The others went up to his room five minutes
ago, but they just left."

1045
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:37,750
"What others?"

1046
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,110
I shouted.

1047
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:43,350
"Three guys in black suits and dark glasses,"
she replied.

1048
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,300
"I thought they were the ones I was expecting."

1049
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,600
"Did O'Neill leave with them?"

1050
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,770
I asked.

1051
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,110
"No," Gina replied.

1052
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:53,750
"Oh my God!

1053
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:57,060
Give me the room number quick!"

1054
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,060
I shouted.

1055
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:04,620
"I hope we're not too late!"

1056
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:08,620
CHAPTER NINE
The Metro, Avenue C

1057
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:14,680
"Second floor, Room 219," said Gina.

1058
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,490
No time to lose.

1059
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:19,540
Joe and I ran upstairs to the room.

1060
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:23,080
The door was open and the lock was broken.

1061
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:27,760
Inside, we could see that someone had quickly
searched the room.

1062
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,910
An empty travel bag was lying on the floor.

1063
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:35,960
The blankets had been pulled off the bed,
and clothes thrown around the room.

1064
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:43,131
"O'Neill's not here, but those other guys
won't be far away," I said.

1065
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:45,670
"I don't like this one bit.

1066
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:48,580
Let's get back to the lobby."

1067
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:55,520
At the desk, I made a 911 call for the police,
described the three guys and their car, and

1068
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:02,860
said, "I believe they're looking for Patrick
O'Neill, who's staying at this hotel."

1069
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:09,020
We walked out onto the street to wait for
the police, who I knew ought to be here in

1070
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,020
minutes.

1071
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,130
But things now happened very quickly.

1072
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:18,380
A guy in dark glasses was standing opposite
us, across the road.

1073
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:25,020
He laughed and said, "I guess you ain't going
no place fast."

1074
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:29,790
Then he began to cross the street, like he
didn't need to hurry.

1075
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:32,930
He spoke again: "You guys.

1076
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,740
Just tell me where O'Neill is.

1077
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:41,630
Then you can go home and forget you ever saw
me.

1078
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:46,880
He wanted O'Neill, but we had no idea where
he might be.

1079
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,170
I looked left and right along the street.

1080
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:55,730
On either side of us was a guy in a black
suit walking slowly toward us.

1081
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,960
Both of them were carrying guns.

1082
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,870
We had no place to run, no place to hide.

1083
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:07,900
Luckily, Joe was thinking more quickly than
me.

1084
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:14,420
"Back inside the hotel, now!" he shouted and
pushed me toward the entrance.

1085
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,870
We turned and ran inside.

1086
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:22,150
Behind us I could hear the sound of running
feet as they chased after us.

1087
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:27,710
"On the floor, behind the desk, now!" said
Joe.

1088
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:33,980
There was no time to say "If you please, ma'am"
as I threw Gina to the ground.

1089
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:38,680
The front door opened with a crash, but Joe
was ready for them.

1090
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:45,190
I heard two shots, followed by a scream, then
everything was quiet.

1091
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:49,000
There was a cloud of smoke from the shots
in the air.

1092
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,920
Joe was now at the desk.

1093
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,980
"I think I hit one, but they'll be back,"
said Joe.

1094
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,140
"We have to hurry.

1095
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,940
Gina, you got to help us!

1096
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,520
Is there a back entrance?"

1097
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,110
"Through here," replied Gina.

1098
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:06,450
"Follow me."

1099
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:10,510
She led us through a door behind the desk,
then down some steps.

1100
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:15,560
Behind us I heard a crash as the men in black
returned.

1101
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,950
We were now hurrying through the hotel kitchen.

1102
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:22,750
I heard shouts and feet on the stairs.

1103
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,750
They were getting close.

1104
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:32,520
"Turn off any lights and lock doors behind
us if you can," I told Gina.

1105
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,870
I decided to make things more difficult for
the guys following us.

1106
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:40,650
I pulled glasses and bottles to the floor.

1107
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:45,480
We reached the back door just as we heard
the men coming into the kitchen.

1108
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,750
There was a shot, which left a hole in the
wall beside me.

1109
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,730
That was much too close.

1110
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:58,960
A second later, the room was in complete darkness
as Gina turned off the lights.

1111
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,930
There were shouts as one of the guys fell
over.

1112
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,920
"Up these steps.

1113
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,160
Hurry!" said Gina.

1114
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:11,000
We were now outside in the cold night air.

1115
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,420
We went up a few more steps, then out into
a narrow street behind the hotel.

1116
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:23,290
In the darkness, I could just see back entrances
to buildings along Avenue C.

1117
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:27,070
We had passed a few doors when Gina suddenly
stopped.

1118
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:29,250
"I don't know what to do!"

1119
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,440
she screamed.

1120
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,020
"Through this door, quickly," I ordered.

1121
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,730
"And get down!"

1122
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,810
We hit the ground behind some boxes.

1123
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:44,000
It didn't smell too clean down there, but
this wasn't the time to worry about the dry

1124
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,170
cleaner's bill.

1125
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:53,790
Gina had started to cry, so I put my hand
over her mouth to keep her quiet.

1126
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,580
"Don't make a sound,' Joe whispered.

1127
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:02,320
"With luck, the NYPD should arrive before
they find us."

1128
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:07,260
As we hid there in the darkness, we heard
feet running to the left and right along the

1129
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,230
narrow street.

1130
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:13,880
Then we heard the steps returning more slowly,
and voices.

1131
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,600
"They got to be here someplace," said one.

1132
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,420
"They can't have gotten far."

1133
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:23,570
"Start with these doors," said another.

1134
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,400
"Let's see where they're hiding."

1135
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:31,740
There was crash after crash as the doors were
opened.

1136
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:32,890
More shots.

1137
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:38,400
Well, that's one way to unlock a door if you
don't have the key.

1138
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,650
The noise was now getting closer.

1139
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,610
I kept my hand over Gina's mouth.

1140
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:47,530
Her body was shaking.

1141
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:54,520
Finally, above the crashes and shots, a new
but very welcome sound.

1142
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,220
The scream of a police car.

1143
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,670
"It's the cops.

1144
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,100
Let's get out of here!"

1145
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,160
shouted a voice on the other side of the door.

1146
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,610
We heard them running back toward the hotel.

1147
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,840
Then all went quiet.

1148
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,360
After waiting a few minutes, I decided it
was safe to come out.

1149
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:23,270
Back inside the hotel kitchen, it looked like
the morning after a wild party.

1150
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:28,420
We walked carefully around the broken glasses
and bottles on the floor.

1151
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:34,210
In the hotel lobby, two guys in black suits
were lying on the floor.

1152
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:37,370
Above them stood two NYPD cops.

1153
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,300
"Am I pleased to see you!"

1154
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,400
I said.

1155
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,220
"I'm Nat Marley, licensed private investigator.

1156
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,150
Did you catch all three of them?"

1157
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,780
"Yes, sir.

1158
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,680
The other one is outside with the sergeant.

1159
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:54,150
He'll need an ambulance," said one of the
cops.

1160
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:57,340
"We got here just in time," said the other.

1161
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,170
"Captain Oldenberg's on his way.

1162
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:02,540
He'll need to question you."

1163
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,890
Gina was feeling better.

1164
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:08,640
Her suit was black with dirt and oil.

1165
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,430
Mine didn't look much cleaner, though.

1166
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,490
Now I started to shake.

1167
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,490
It's always the same.

1168
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:23,220
It never hits me at the time, but later, when
I realize I'm lucky to be alive.

1169
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:27,970
"I guess I could make everyone coffee," said
Gina.

1170
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:30,500
"That'd be great."

1171
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:36,930
But then I had a sudden thought and shouted,
"Joe, upstairs now!"

1172
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,520
We ran back up to Room 219.

1173
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,500
The door was closed and when I knocked there
was no reply.

1174
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,080
I put my ear to the door and listened.

1175
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,110
Somebody was moving around in the room.

1176
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:57,310
I tried to open the door, but there was something
against it on the other side.

1177
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:04,330
However, it wasn't strong enough for Joe's
boot and flew open.

1178
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:07,750
Inside we saw a man holding the travel bag.

1179
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:13,030
He threw the bag into Joe's face and tried
to push past me.

1180
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:17,400
But I was able to catch his coat and pull
him to the floor.

1181
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:26,790
I looked at him closely - a middle-aged guy
with gray hair and black metal glasses - Patrick

1182
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,790
O'Neill.

1183
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,390
"Don't be afraid!"

1184
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,390
I said.

1185
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,840
"I'm Nat Marley, private investigator.

1186
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,920
I'm working for your wife, Joyce.

1187
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,270
You're going be safe.

1188
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:46,020
It's time to stop running."

1189
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,960
CHAPTER TEN
Time to fight back

1190
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:55,020
There was a hopeless look in O'Neill's eyes.

1191
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,520
His lips moved, but he couldn't speak.

1192
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,920
I shook his shoulders and made him look straight
at me.

1193
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,400
"Listen, we're the good guys.

1194
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,670
You're out of danger.

1195
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:10,500
Your wife sent us to find you."

1196
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:16,320
He still seemed to be unsure, so I pulled
him to his feet and tried again.

1197
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,790
"Here's my cellphone.

1198
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:20,880
It's calling my office number.

1199
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:27,580
As soon as my personal assistant answers,
ask to speak to Joyce."

1200
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,930
We waited while he spoke to his wife.

1201
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:33,940
He sat down on the bed as he talked.

1202
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:38,880
Now he looked tired and weak, like a lost
child.

1203
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:46,440
"If you don't mind, Mr. O'Neill, I need to
talk to my personal assistant now," I said.

1204
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,920
He returned my cellphone.

1205
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,240
"Stella, listen carefully," I said.

1206
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:58,190
"Call a cab, and take Mrs. O'Neill to Frankie's
Cocktail Lounge on 5th Street.

1207
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:02,000
We're going to meet you there as soon as possible.

1208
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:09,000
We need to make Oldenberg believe that O'Neill
is not Steinmann's killer."

1209
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,350
Now O'Neill was beginning to look more normal.

1210
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:18,310
"I guess I should say sorry," he said.

1211
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,320
"How did you know where to find me?"

1212
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,780
"I can explain that," I replied.

1213
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:30,810
"Through information in your bank accounts,
we learned that you'd made payments to a Van

1214
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:31,810
Zandt.

1215
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:35,300
That's how we found your old friend Frank."

1216
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:40,620
"So you know about the poker games," said
O'Neill.

1217
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:45,500
"When I told Joyce I was working late, I was
actually-"

1218
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,930
"It doesn't matter now," I said.

1219
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:54,940
"Van Zandt told us that you'd checked into
a hotel somewhere in the East Village.

1220
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,920
You heard about Steinmann's murder?

1221
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:03,120
The police think you did it, but I didn't
think that could be true.

1222
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,890
So I thought you might be in danger too.

1223
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:10,650
But how did you get away from the guys in
black suits?"

1224
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:15,580
"I was watching the street from my window,"
began O'Neill.

1225
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:20,140
"I saw them arrive and thought they had to
be bad news.

1226
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:24,480
I ran up to the top floor and hid in a blanket
cupboard.

1227
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,760
I'd been up there for about ten minutes when
I heard the shots.

1228
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:35,710
So I stayed there until I heard the police
car arrive and came down to my floor.

1229
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:41,220
When I looked out of my window again, I could
see the sergeant outside with one of them.

1230
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:45,470
Finally, I thought it was safe enough to escape."

1231
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:49,350
"That letter you sent to Van Zandt.

1232
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,020
What do all those numbers mean?"

1233
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,320
I asked.

1234
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:58,480
"They're the reason why Steinmann was murdered,"
replied O'Neill.

1235
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,310
Suddenly, there was someone at the door.

1236
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,210
It was Captain Oldenberg.

1237
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:12,140
He looked around, shook his head and asked
in a tired voice, "Would you mind telling

1238
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,190
me what's going on, Marley?"

1239
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:20,770
"Oldenberg, let me introduce Mr. Patrick O'Neill.

1240
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,750
Mr. O'Neill was almost murdered here tonight.

1241
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:29,580
Thanks to the sergeant and his team, we're
all still alive.

1242
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:32,510
Mr. O'Neill has a story to tell you.

1243
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:38,790
I believe that once you know all the facts,
it will be clear that he can't be Steinmann's

1244
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,790
killer."

1245
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,690
"I'm listening, Marley," said Oldenberg.

1246
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:48,460
"But whether he's the killer is for the police
to decide, not you."

1247
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:54,450
"Mr. O'Neill can show you all the information
you need," I continued.

1248
01:25:54,450 --> 01:26:02,330
"If you agree, it means a quick journey to
Frankie's Cocktail Lounge on 5 th Street.

1249
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,420
Everything's there."

1250
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:07,260
"Agreed," said Oldenberg.

1251
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:11,980
"But for the moment, O'Neill, you're still
wanted for murder, and that means you're my

1252
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,250
prisoner.

1253
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:20,530
Anyway, I guess Police Headquarters will be
rather safer than this hotel."

1254
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:26,300
We all went downstairs, back to reception,
where Oldenberg organized everyone.

1255
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,270
"Sergeant, you're coming with me and O'Neill.

1256
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:34,160
Have your men take away the other two prisoners
and one officer should stay with the guy who

1257
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,560
was shot."

1258
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,230
Joe had to leave and get some help with his
car.

1259
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:45,840
Oldenberg drove us through the East Village
back to 5th Street.

1260
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,380
Frankie's Cocktail Lounge was now noisy with
the evening crowd.

1261
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,910
A jazz band was getting ready to play.

1262
01:26:52,910 --> 01:27:00,420
I saw Stella and Mrs. O'Neill sitting at a
corner table, waiting for us to arrive.

1263
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:05,060
"Your husband's outside, Mrs. O'Neill," I
told her.

1264
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:12,130
"If you could be patient for a few more minutes,
I'll find somewhere less public to talk."

1265
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:16,570
I went over to the bar and shouted above the
noise to the bartender.

1266
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,520
"I need to speak to Frank.

1267
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,950
Where can I find him?"

1268
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:24,250
"In the back room," answered the bartender.

1269
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,740
"Just go straight through."

1270
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:33,430
I coughed as I entered because the air was
heavy with cigarette smoke.

1271
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:37,320
"O'Neill's outside with the police," I said.

1272
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,080
"Could we meet in here?

1273
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,450
Oh, and we'll need that envelope."

1274
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,730
"Sure.

1275
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:51,300
Let's get some fresh air in here," said Van
Zandt as he threw open a window.

1276
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:57,340
Oldenberg brought O'Neill into the room, and
Stella followed with Mrs. O'Neill.

1277
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:02,890
As soon as everybody was inside the office,
O'Neill took his wife in his arms.

1278
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:06,900
"It's wonderful to see you again, Joyce,"
he said.

1279
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,680
"I'm going to stop hiding.

1280
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,430
Now it's time to fight back."

1281
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:16,920
"Patrick, I've been so worried for you," she
said.

1282
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,880
"What's been happening?

1283
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,110
Why all these secrets?"

1284
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:25,350
"There's so much to ex plain," replied O'Neill.

1285
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:27,910
"I'll tell you everything, I promise.

1286
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:36,130
But first, I have to make the captain understand
that I'm not to blame for Steinmann's death."

1287
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:39,180
O'Neill turned to Oldenberg and opened the
envelope.

1288
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:43,320
He took out the papers and laid them on the
table.

1289
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:50,190
He said, "These are secret papers from the
Ocean Star president's office.

1290
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,810
There's enough information here to send Lorraine
Houston to jail."

1291
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:59,230
"If you could keep it short," said Oldenberg.

1292
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:00,260
"OK.

1293
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:04,090
Ocean Star is an investment firm.

1294
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:08,510
Its business is making money for its clients,"
continued O'Neill.

1295
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,150
"How do they do this?

1296
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:17,930
By investing clients' money in the international
money markets - or that's what should happen.

1297
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:19,530
Look at this page.

1298
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:24,530
It's organized in two halves, so let's compare
the two sides.

1299
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:31,180
On the left the numbers show money that was
paid to clients - often a fifteen per cent

1300
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,180
return.

1301
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:37,170
On the right we see what the firm actually
made from investments.

1302
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,790
Surprise, surprise!

1303
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:42,920
These numbers are far less.

1304
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,190
You realize what this means?"

1305
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:49,080
"Go on, tell me," said Oldenberg.

1306
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,120
"You're the accountant."

1307
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:56,980
"Ocean Star can't possibly earn enough from
its investments to pay big money to the clients

1308
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:59,720
and millions to the president.

1309
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:04,430
It's using the money from new clients to pay
the old clients.

1310
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:09,760
As long as it continues to get large numbers
of new clients, this can work, and people

1311
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,170
think it's the smartest firm on Wall Street.

1312
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,520
However, it's a serious crime.

1313
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,320
I believe that's why Steinmann was murdered.

1314
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:26,450
He knew about it too after I showed him these
accounts, and he talked to Houston.

1315
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:32,520
I want to make all this public, and now I
don't care if it destroys Ocean Star at the

1316
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,610
same time.

1317
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:36,660
Is that clear, Captain?"

1318
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:40,170
"More or less," replied Oldenberg.

1319
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:43,840
"If I could take those papers...

1320
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,130
Thanks.

1321
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,710
But there are a lot more questions which I
want answered.

1322
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:52,660
We'll continue at Police Headquarters.

1323
01:30:52,660 --> 01:31:02,210
Mr. O'Neill, you're still my prisoner."

1324
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:07,410
CHAPTER ELEVEN
O'Neill's story

1325
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:12,020
At Police Headquarters, Oldenberg led us up
to his office.

1326
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:18,380
I'd sent Stella home - at least one of us
should try and get a good night's sleep.

1327
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:22,680
Mrs. O'Neill wouldn't leave her husband.

1328
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:27,470
Inside Oldenberg's office, it couldn't be
more different from the offices I'd seen at

1329
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:29,490
Ocean Star.

1330
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:34,880
The walls were a dirty green color and there
was no carpeting on the floor.

1331
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,340
"Basic" was the best word to describe it.

1332
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:42,210
Oldenberg had ordered coffee and sandwiches
for everybody.

1333
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:48,350
At least the NYPD coffee tasted better than
it used to when I was a cop.

1334
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:53,220
"You have a story to tell us, Mr. O'Neill,"
said Oldenberg.

1335
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:59,130
"I want to know everything about you, Steinmann
and Ocean Star."

1336
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,800
"OK.

1337
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,960
Two years ago, the old department head moved
to another firm," began O'Neill.

1338
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,330
"I'd worked at Ocean Star for over eight years
and I thought I had a good chance of getting

1339
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:13,940
the job.

1340
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:20,550
I was wrong - the president, Lorraine Houston,
had decided to bring in someone new.

1341
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:23,920
Someone who didn't care who he hurt.

1342
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,490
"So I went on with my work and did what was
necessary.

1343
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:35,340
With Steinmann as head of department, the
firm was making even more money than before.

1344
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:41,540
Houston thought he was wonderful, but people
who were working with me thought the opposite.

1345
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,180
Steinmann loved to push people hard.

1346
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:50,240
"A year ago, I asked Steinmann how the firm
could continue paying so much money to its

1347
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,930
clients.

1348
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:57,440
The money our department made from clients'
investments wasn't that high.

1349
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:02,040
I did the math again and still didn't understand.

1350
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,380
Where was the money coming from?

1351
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:09,490
I was worried, but Steinmann promised me that
there were no problems.

1352
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:14,400
He said, 'Just do your job and don't ask too
many questions.

1353
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,300
She knows what she's doing on the top floor.'

1354
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:23,810
"The 'top floor' is where Lorraine Houston
has her offices.

1355
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:27,930
Steinmann hoped to get his own office there
some day.

1356
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:33,340
It seemed impossible to talk to him, so I
kept my mouth shut.

1357
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:39,170
Time passed and Ocean Star went on paying
out big money to its clients.

1358
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:46,310
Then, on Friday morning last week, I received
the information that could destroy the firm

1359
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:49,110
and send Lorraine Houston to jail.

1360
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:52,180
"It happened by chance.

1361
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:55,050
I got a letter from Houston's office.

1362
01:33:55,050 --> 01:34:01,010
At first I didn't understand why I'd been
sent a hard copy of the accounts - usually

1363
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:05,180
everything like that is sent through office
email.

1364
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:09,630
I soon realized that it had been a mistake.

1365
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:14,820
Houston's personal assistant had sent me an
envelope which was meant to go to the vice-president.

1366
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:20,900
"I knew I shouldn't, but I continued reading.

1367
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:24,820
As I read, I was more and more surprised.

1368
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:29,840
Now I understood that the public accounts
weren't the truth.

1369
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,740
These were secret accounts, which weren't
on computer.

1370
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:39,130
They showed that Ocean Star was using the
money from its new clients to pay the old

1371
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,200
ones.

1372
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:48,390
Now I understood how Houston had so much to
spend on her cars, homes, clothes and vacations.

1373
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:55,170
"I didn't like the idea, but I thought I should
talk with Steinmann.

1374
01:34:55,170 --> 01:35:00,920
I knew I had to be careful, so I made a copy
of the accounts to show him.

1375
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,340
What about the ones I'd received?

1376
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:07,130
How could I get the information out of the
building safely?

1377
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:14,110
I had an idea - I put the accounts in an envelope
and addressed it to my old friend Frank Van

1378
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:15,239
Zandt.

1379
01:35:15,239 --> 01:35:19,860
Then I left the building for five minutes
and dropped the envelope in the nearest mailbox.

1380
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:27,130
"Later that morning, I spoke with Steinmann,
and gave him the copy of the accounts.

1381
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:30,020
He was immediately very interested.

1382
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:34,190
He laughed and said, 'So that's how she does
it.

1383
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:35,840
You've done the right thing.

1384
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,550
I'll go straight upstairs and talk with Houston.

1385
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:43,740
With this information, I could make a lot
of money.

1386
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:46,550
Maybe I'll share some with you.'

1387
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:52,530
"His plan was to ask Houston to pay him to
keep quiet.

1388
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:57,550
I became really angry with him and tried to
make him change his mind.

1389
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,300
But he refused.

1390
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:04,230
He wouldn't listen to me and went up to the
top floor.

1391
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:08,940
Now I knew that I could be in real trouble
because Steinmann had gotten the accounts

1392
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:10,530
from me.

1393
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:16,010
I wasn't sure what to do, but my first move
was to get out of the office quick.

1394
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:23,590
"I told my personal assistant that I'd had
an awful headache all day and had to go home.

1395
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:28,900
Back home, I waited a couple of hours, then
made some phone calls.

1396
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:32,030
First I called Steinmann's personal assistant.

1397
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:37,090
She told me that Steinmann's desk was empty
and his computer was gone, but she couldn't

1398
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:39,480
tell me anything more.

1399
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:44,000
I sent Steinmann an angry email to his home
computer.

1400
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,350
I wrote something like, 'I didn't think you
could be so stupid.

1401
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:51,040
I can't believe what you've done.'

1402
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:58,730
"The next day, I felt bad about what I'd said
in the email, so I tried to phone Steinmann.

1403
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:04,920
His wife answered and told me that he hadn't
come home, and she was very worried.

1404
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:10,000
That night, I stayed up late thinking about
what I should do.

1405
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,290
Just before midnight I got a call.

1406
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:17,880
Someone said, 'You have information which
belongs to the firm.

1407
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,390
Return this information to Ms. Houston by
midday tomorrow if you want to stay alive.'

1408
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:27,790
"How could I return the accounts?

1409
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:30,670
They were in the U.S. Mail.

1410
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:34,760
So I thought the safest thing to do was to
hide.

1411
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:39,800
I wrote a note for Joyce and left in the middle
of the night.

1412
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,450
Looking back, maybe it wasn't the most intelligent
decision.

1413
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:51,030
I packed a bag, left by the back entrance,
took a cab to Frank Van Zandt's place.

1414
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:55,610
I can promise you I left my car on Henry Street.

1415
01:37:55,610 --> 01:38:01,780
I told Frank to expect the letter with the
accounts, then I checked into a hotel.

1416
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:08,400
On Monday morning I took out $10,000 from
the bank so I wouldn't need to use any credit

1417
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,840
cards.

1418
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,280
I think you know the rest of the story."

1419
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,340
"Thanks, Mr. O'Neill," said Oldenberg.

1420
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,590
"That's very helpful."

1421
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:24,730
Oldenberg led me to another office.

1422
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:31,630
He thought for a few moments, then said, "Marley,
I need some advice.

1423
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:39,280
My problem is this - if I accept that Houston
ordered Steinmann's murder, how can I show

1424
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,250
that it's true?"

1425
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:45,180
"If you'll allow me, Captain," I said.

1426
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:54,730
"I got an idea that just might work."

1427
01:38:54,730 --> 01:39:00,930
CHAPTER TWELVE
If the price is right

1428
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:05,950
What if nobody knew that O'Neill was at Police
Headquarters?

1429
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:11,620
That would give us the chance to tell some
clever lies - lies that might give us the

1430
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:13,210
advantage.

1431
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:15,870
I shared my ideas with the captain.

1432
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:23,610
"We don't know for sure, but let's say Lorraine
Houston planned Steinmann's murder," I began.

1433
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:30,340
"She's killed one person and she wants O'Neill
badly enough to kill again.

1434
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:33,739
Why don't we try out this plan?

1435
01:39:33,739 --> 01:39:40,110
Give the news of what happened at the Metro
Hotel tonight to the newspapers, TV and radio

1436
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:41,590
stations.

1437
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:47,570
Some of it can be true, but a few things can
be changed.

1438
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:54,250
We tell them that O'Neill escaped and is believed
to be somewhere in the East Village area.

1439
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:56,680
Houston will be very afraid.

1440
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:01,630
She has a lot to lose if she doesn't find
O'Neill first and stop him from talking."

1441
01:40:01,630 --> 01:40:04,290
"OK, Marley.

1442
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,970
So far, so good.

1443
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,800
What next?" asked Oldenberg.

1444
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:13,170
"If you agree, I could speak with her.

1445
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:18,220
I'll tell her I have something to sell - the
secret accounts."

1446
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:22,200
"Go on," said Oldenberg.

1447
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,140
"I'm interested.

1448
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,160
But why you?

1449
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:28,830
Why couldn't an NYPD officer do it?"

1450
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:35,790
"I'll tell her I've found O'Neill and am keeping
him someplace safe - where she'll never find

1451
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:37,080
him.

1452
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:44,690
I'll also tell her I have the accounts, which
I'll offer to sell if the price is right.

1453
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:47,989
I'll make her an offer which she can't refuse.

1454
01:40:47,989 --> 01:40:55,900
For $100,000 I'll return the accounts to her
and give O'Neill to the police.

1455
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,650
Houston will think she has won.

1456
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:05,020
The secret accounts will be safe and O'Neill
will be in jail for Steinmann's murder.

1457
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:08,720
I'll meet with her, then try and get her to
talk."

1458
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,280
"Come on, Marley.

1459
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,870
Get real!" said Oldenberg.

1460
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:18,810
"You think a hard businesswoman like Houston
is just going to say, 'Oh, by the way, I ordered

1461
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,780
Steinmann's murder.'"

1462
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:26,810
"I'll let her think I'm the same sort of person
as her," I continued.

1463
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:33,330
"A businessman who doesn't care how he earns
his money or who he hurts.

1464
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:38,040
If she feels comfortable with me, then we
might get the truth."

1465
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,120
"This had better work, Marley.

1466
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:46,590
I hope you're a good enough actor," said Oldenberg.

1467
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:53,990
"Believe me, Oldenberg, on a good day I could
win Oscars," I told him.

1468
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:55,690
"All right.

1469
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:59,410
We'll do it," replied Oldenberg.

1470
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:02,610
"This could be dangerous.

1471
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:04,260
You know that as well as I do.

1472
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:08,570
You'll need a full NYPD team behind you.

1473
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:13,989
I'll organize that as soon as you and Houston
have a time and a place to meet.

1474
01:42:13,989 --> 01:42:19,180
So now I'll talk to the newspapers and Houston
will think that O'Neill is still in hiding."

1475
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,970
"OK.

1476
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:24,500
And one more thing," I said.

1477
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:29,100
"Mrs. O'Neill and her daughter Julia could
be in real danger.

1478
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,330
Could you move them to an NYPD safe house?"

1479
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:39,970
"Consider it done," said Oldenberg.

1480
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,970
* * *

1481
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,800
Wednesday had been a very long day.

1482
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,830
I got home at three o'clock in the morning
and I was so tired that I felt like a dead

1483
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,580
man walking.

1484
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:53,820
I fell into bed and slept well.

1485
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:57,880
The next morning I woke up late, feeling much
better.

1486
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:02,200
After quickly getting dressed, I ran down
to the nearest newsstand and picked up the

1487
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,239
morning newspapers.

1488
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:10,550
I took the papers into Slim Pete's Diner on
Main Street to read more carefully.

1489
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:12,860
The name "Slim" is a joke.

1490
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:16,250
Actually, he has a serious weight problem.

1491
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:21,650
"What'll it be, Mr. Marley?" asked Pete with
a big smile.

1492
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:25,480
"Eggs, pancakes and bacon," I answered.

1493
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,710
"And make that coffee strong, will you?"

1494
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:31,110
"You got it.

1495
01:43:31,110 --> 01:43:34,860
So what's the famous Mr. Marley doing today?"
asked Pete.

1496
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:38,940
"Helping New York's Finest win the war against
crime?

1497
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:42,940
"Something like that," I replied.

1498
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:49,170
"New York's Finest" - that's what people call
the NYPD.

1499
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:55,100
I never thought of myself as one of the "Finest"
when I was a cop and I never thought I was

1500
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,960
fighting a war.

1501
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,070
I was just doing my job.

1502
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:05,760
If there was a little less crime on the streets
by the end of the day, that was good enough

1503
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,670
for me.

1504
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:11,940
I read through the newspapers.

1505
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:14,730
Oldenberg had done an excellent job.

1506
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:19,340
The O'Neill story was on all the front pages.

1507
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:26,489
The headline of the Daily News read, "NYPD's
MOST WANTED ESCAPES".

1508
01:44:26,489 --> 01:44:34,420
The New York Post headline made me smile:
"KILLER ACCOUNTANT ON THE RUN".

1509
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:40,610
There was some truth, but the rest of the
story sounded like something from the movies:

1510
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:47,200
"This man is both intelligent and dangerous,"
said Captain Oldenberg.

1511
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:51,300
This wasn't the O'Neill that I knew.

1512
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:55,260
While I ate my breakfast, I watched the TV
news.

1513
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:03,250
Their reporter said, "This is Cindy Lu outside
the Metro Hotel on Avenue C. Here, last night,

1514
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:09,870
NYPD officers almost caught Patrick O'Neill,
the man wanted for the murder of Ronald Steinmann..."

1515
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:13,920
"Well done, Oldenberg," I thought.

1516
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,700
Now Houston would get a clear message.

1517
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:24,090
Neither her people nor the NYPD had found
O'Neill, so she still had a real problem on

1518
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:25,720
her hands.

1519
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:30,580
I hoped she was one very worried woman.

1520
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:33,640
I got to the office by ten o'clock.

1521
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,580
Stella had already been there a couple of
hours.

1522
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:39,220
"That was quite a day, yesterday.

1523
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,720
You feeling OK, now?"

1524
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,800
she asked.

1525
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:45,080
"A lot better," I replied.

1526
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:49,560
"And thank you for taking care of Mrs. O'Neill
all day.

1527
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:54,730
With luck, we're going to send Lorraine Houston
to jail."

1528
01:45:54,730 --> 01:46:00,050
During the morning I agreed on a plan with
Oldenberg.

1529
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:05,630
I would meet with Houston in a public area,
the kind of place where it would be easy for

1530
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:09,680
an NYPD team to watch and wait.

1531
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:17,590
Our choice was Battery Park, at the foot of
Manhattan, with its tall trees and green grass.

1532
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:21,330
This is where New York meets the ocean.

1533
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:29,180
From here you can look across Upper New York
Bay to the Statue of Liberty and Staten Island.

1534
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:34,700
I tried to get through to Houston on my cellphone,
but her personal assistant wouldn't allow

1535
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:36,280
me to speak with her.

1536
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:43,030
"I'm sorry, sir, but Ms. Houston isn't taking
any calls," she said.

1537
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:46,700
I wasn't going to take "no" for an answer.

1538
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:50,530
"Listen carefully and just do what I say.

1539
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:54,630
Your boss lost something of great importance.

1540
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:58,470
Tell her I've found it and want to return
it to her.

1541
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:04,420
I'll call back in ten minutes and expect to
speak with her in person.

1542
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,420
Understood?"

1543
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:08,540
"Careful, now," I told myself.

1544
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:11,470
"No mistakes."

1545
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:16,200
I waited a full fifteen minutes before calling
back.

1546
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,420
People think less clearly when they get impatient.

1547
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:23,930
This time I got ahold of Houston immediately.

1548
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:27,030
"Who are you and what do you want?"

1549
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,650
she asked crossly.

1550
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,680
"The name's Marley.

1551
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,050
I was working for Mr. O'Neill.

1552
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:38,700
He found some interesting papers of yours,
which he gave me to look after.

1553
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:45,970
Now I'm working for myself and I thought that
you might like to have those papers back.

1554
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:49,010
I'll make this offer even more generous.

1555
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:54,180
The police will be very interested when I
tell them where O'Neill is.

1556
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:58,430
The price is $100,000.

1557
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:01,740
Wait in your office for my call at eight o'clock
tomorrow morning."

1558
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:04,110
"What?" began Houston.

1559
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,489
"That's it, lady!"

1560
01:48:06,489 --> 01:48:07,489
I shouted.

1561
01:48:07,489 --> 01:48:13,160
"Be ready in your office, eight o'clock tomorrow
with $100,000, OK?

1562
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:18,130
And don't think of doing anything clever or
every newspaper in this city will know the

1563
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:22,520
truth about Ocean Star's accounts."

1564
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:25,960
With that, I ended the call.

1565
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:29,650
I felt very pleased with myself.

1566
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:38,630
Would I still feel so pleased tomorrow?

1567
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:41,380
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Battery Park

1568
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:47,760
Friday, October 8th, 7:00 a.m.

1569
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:55,040
I was on my way from Grand Central Station
to Bowling Green on a number five train.

1570
01:48:55,040 --> 01:49:00,520
This subway station is just north of Battery
Park, which was where I was going to meet

1571
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,200
Lorraine Houston.

1572
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:10,890
Battery Park is a public area where it would
be easier for the NYPD team to watch and wait.

1573
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:16,800
I thought that Houston would feel uncomfortable
away from the deep carpets and expensive furniture

1574
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,690
of her offices.

1575
01:49:19,690 --> 01:49:24,719
From the subway station, it was just a few
minutes' walk to Battery Park.

1576
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:30,659
I walked across to the Sphere, a famous piece
of public art at the north end of the park

1577
01:49:30,659 --> 01:49:37,130
- a large gold metal ball, as tall as a house.

1578
01:49:37,130 --> 01:49:41,860
Oldenberg's team was already waiting there
with hidden cameras, though you wouldn't know

1579
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:44,150
they were police officers.

1580
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:47,480
Two young guys talking on a seat.

1581
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,880
A couple standing under an umbrella.

1582
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,950
Their orders were to watch and wait.

1583
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:59,130
But if I waved my hat, they would immediately
help me.

1584
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:04,170
The sky was full of black clouds and it was
starting to rain.

1585
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:07,490
I put up my umbrella and looked at my watch.

1586
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:11,450
It was eight o'clock, time to call Houston.

1587
01:50:11,450 --> 01:50:13,790
"Ms. Houston?

1588
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:16,110
I'm waiting for you," I said.

1589
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:18,780
"Bring the money and come alone.

1590
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:24,510
If there's any trouble, my personal assistant
has a copy of your accounts ready to email

1591
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:27,970
to every newspaper in New York.

1592
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:32,840
If all goes to plan, she'll destroy that copy."

1593
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,550
"OK.

1594
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:36,310
That's understood," she replied.

1595
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:39,750
"How do I know you're telling the truth?"

1596
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:46,070
"Ask yourself this question: What will happen
if you don't believe me?

1597
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:47,510
I'll need your cellphone number...

1598
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:49,410
Thanks.

1599
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:56,250
Now, leave the building and wait outside the
front entrance."

1600
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:59,050
I let her wait a few minutes in the cold.

1601
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:05,200
I wanted her to feel angry and impatient by
the time she arrived at Battery Park.

1602
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,900
Now for my next call.

1603
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:12,310
"So sorry to keep you waiting," I lied.

1604
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:17,820
"You see a tall white-haired guy in a dark
green overcoat, carrying a copy of the Wall

1605
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:18,820
Street Journal?.

1606
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:23,719
He should be opposite you, standing by a cab."

1607
01:51:23,719 --> 01:51:25,700
Houston said she could see him.

1608
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:28,360
"That's my assistant, Mr. Blaney.

1609
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:31,760
Go and talk with him," I continued.

1610
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,510
"He has a cab waiting for you."

1611
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:40,410
We had to make sure that Houston arrived alone.

1612
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:49,270
Joe Blaney's job was to make sure that she
took our cab - a cab with an NYPD driver.

1613
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:54,010
Houston was going to be taken on a little
tour of Lower Manhattan.

1614
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:59,350
We were going to take our time and make sure
she was in a very bad mood by the time she

1615
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:01,990
met me.

1616
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:05,450
Thirty minutes later I called Houston again.

1617
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:11,140
"Tell the driver to drop you at the north
entrance to Battery Park, opposite Bowling

1618
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,700
Green.

1619
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:15,230
Then walk south to the Sphere.

1620
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:19,030
You'll see me holding a blue and white golf
umbrella.

1621
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:23,140
By the way, you don't need to pay the driver.

1622
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:27,219
Hope you enjoyed your sightseeing."

1623
01:52:27,219 --> 01:52:33,820
I wouldn't like to repeat Houston's reply
- such bad language!

1624
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:38,260
The rain was beginning to fall more heavily
as I saw her.

1625
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:43,760
She was tall and slim and was wearing a red
suit with a short skirt that showed a lot

1626
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,900
of leg.

1627
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,710
She really wasn't dressed for the weather.

1628
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:53,340
I turned on my little secret recorder.

1629
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:59,550
I waved to her and sat on a park seat under
the trees opposite the Sphere.

1630
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:03,590
"This had better be good, Marley," she said.

1631
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:05,690
"Do you have my papers?"

1632
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:08,560
"Not so fast," I replied.

1633
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,700
"Do you have my money?"

1634
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:14,950
She put her case on her knees and opened it.

1635
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:18,740
Inside, it was packed with hundred-dollar
bills.

1636
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:21,910
"Count it if you like," she said.

1637
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:25,840
"Don't you think the park looks lovely in
fall?"

1638
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,850
I asked.

1639
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:29,440
"I don't have all day.

1640
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,900
Hurry up and give me the papers," she said
impatiently.

1641
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:39,960
I slowly reached into my case and took out
an envelope, which I gave to her.

1642
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:44,969
Then I reached into my coat pocket for my
cellphone.

1643
01:53:44,969 --> 01:53:50,420
Houston took a single piece of paper out of
the envelope and looked at me like a dog which

1644
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:51,900
was about to bite.

1645
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:56,780
"Give me the rest of the accounts, Marley,
or you're dead meat!"

1646
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:01,400
She had taken a small gun out of her purse
and was pressing it into my side.

1647
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:05,580
"Not very intelligent, Ms. Houston," I said.

1648
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:10,870
"Remember, if anything happens to me, my personal
assistant will email your accounts to every

1649
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:13,160
newspaper in this city.

1650
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,160
If I press 'Send', my personal assistant gets
that message.

1651
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:22,900
Also, shooting people in public isn't a good
idea.

1652
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,860
You'll get the rest of the papers.

1653
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,489
Just be patient.

1654
01:54:26,489 --> 01:54:32,010
Like any good businessman, I like to count
my money first."

1655
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:38,469
She gave me a cold, hard look through narrow
eyes, then put the gun back in her purse.

1656
01:54:38,469 --> 01:54:41,750
Now she was beginning to shake with the cold.

1657
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:46,200
"Here, take my overcoat," I said.

1658
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:49,630
She took the coat and put it over her shoulders.

1659
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:53,300
She smiled for the first time and thanked
me.

1660
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:57,300
Now I felt I might have the advantage.

1661
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,860
I quickly checked the money, then took a second
envelope from my case and held it in front

1662
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:02,880
of her.

1663
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,400
"There must be some very important information
here.

1664
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:12,130
You're one smart businesswoman, Ms. Houston,
and a good employer.

1665
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:16,200
I like the way you find answers to problems
with your people.

1666
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:20,940
Like sending Steinmann on his final drive
in O'Neill's car.

1667
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,950
Good work.

1668
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:26,130
The police think that O'Neill is the killer.

1669
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:31,760
That way you can be completely sure it's the
end of your trouble with those two.

1670
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:36,810
As soon as I tell the police where O'Neill
is, you're safe."

1671
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:38,570
She smiled again.

1672
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:41,650
"You're a smart guy.

1673
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:43,950
I'm sorry about Steinmann.

1674
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:49,739
He was good at his job, until he started to
think he was smarter than me.

1675
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:52,989
I couldn't let him tell me what to do.

1676
01:55:52,989 --> 01:55:56,250
I had to get rid of him."

1677
01:55:56,250 --> 01:56:01,720
At last I had it, and everything was on the
recorder.

1678
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:04,340
I passed her the second envelope.

1679
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:08,330
She opened it quickly, took out the papers
and counted them.

1680
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:11,570
"Looks like it's all here.

1681
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:16,810
It's been good doing business with you," she
said, and returned my overcoat.

1682
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:22,980
"Now just make sure the police get ahold of
O'Neill."

1683
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:31,450
As she walked away, I called to her, "Actually,
Ms. Houston, I got a message from O'Neill.

1684
01:56:31,450 --> 01:56:34,620
He'd like to tell you, 'Smile!

1685
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:38,330
You're on a police camera!"'

1686
01:56:38,330 --> 01:56:40,930
I waved my hat in the air.

1687
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:47,240
Houston screamed and pulled out her gun, but
in seconds the NYPD team was all around her.

1688
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:51,280
She dropped the gun and fell to the ground.

1689
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:58,090
A minute ago she had been the president of
Ocean Star Finance and a very rich woman.

1690
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:03,420
Now she was going to spend many years in jail.

1691
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:06,150
I called Oldenberg to tell him the news.

1692
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:09,650
"Good work, Marley!" he said.

1693
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:14,660
"O'Neill will soon be a free man."

1694
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:20,390
The rain had stopped and the sun had begun
to break through the heavy clouds.

1695
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:26,290
In the sunshine, leaves were dropping from
the trees and turning in the wind.

1696
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:31,030
The air from the ocean smelled fresh and clean.

1697
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:35,050
It felt good to be alive.

1698
01:57:35,050 --> 02:00:35,320
I should spend more time in this city's parks.

1699
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:35,530
- THE END -
