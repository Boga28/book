00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,819
CHAPTER ONE
A Visitor

2
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:24,539
My name's Samuel. Lenny Samuel. You can call
me Len.

3
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,789
I'm a private eye. A private eye is a private
detective - a detective who will work for

4
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,440
anyone who will pay him. I'm not a policeman.
I work on my own as a private eye.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,941
My office is on the west side of Los Angeles,
on the fourth floor of a high building. There

6
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:47,649
are only two rooms in my office - the outer
room and the inner room. The outer room is

7
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:52,079
the waiting-room. There are four chairs in
the waiting-room, although there are never

8
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,089
four people waiting to see me. In fact, there
is usually no one at all waiting to see me.

9
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:02,760
In the inner room, there's a cheap wooden
desk. There's a big wooden chair for me to

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,030
sit on and, on the opposite side of the desk,
there's a low metal chair for my visitors.

11
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,200
The rest of the furniture in my office consists
of a large, empty metal cupboard, and a low

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,360
bed in one corner. When there is a lot of
work, I sometimes sleep in the office.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,479
The notice outside my door says: "L. Samuel.
Private Detective." That's me. I'm quite tall,

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,750
nearly two metres, and I weigh eighty kilos.
A lot of men say that I'm ugly, but women

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,881
seem to find me attractive. I've got brown
eyes, brown hair and very nice teeth. I had

16
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:44,190
a good nose, too, until someone broke it in
a fight last year.

17
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,390
Recently, I haven't been very busy. In fact,
I've had very little to do. However, I did

18
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,790
have some work last month. It all started
late one afternoon, when I was sitting in

19
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,799
my office. I had just finished cutting my
nails and I was about to clean them.

20
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,840
Suddenly, I heard someone walk into the outer
room. I always leave the door of the outer

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,509
room open, in case anyone wants to come in
and see me. When I heard the footsteps in

22
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,230
the outer room, I wasn't very surprised.

23
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,620
I thought that someone had made a mistake
and come into the wrong office. It was probably

24
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,959
someone looking for the doctor next door.

25
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,130
But a moment later, there was a very quiet
knock on the door of the inner room.

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,630
'Come in,' I shouted and put away the scissors
I had been cutting my nails with.

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,920
The door opened and in walked one of the most
beautiful women I had ever seen. She was about

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,199
eighteen years old, with blue eyes and long
blonde hair. She was wearing a smart green

29
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,720
coat and had a big brown handbag over her
shoulder.

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,950
'Excuse me,' said the girl. 'I'm looking for
Mr Samuel.'

31
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,970
'I'm Samuel,' I said, with a quick smile.
'Come in and sit down.'

32
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,730
The girl didn't smile back at me.

33
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,690
'No, I won't sit down,' she said.

34
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,600
'Well, if you won't sit down, at least come
in and close the door,' I replied.

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,370
The girl came in, walked over and put her
handbag on my desk.

36
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,700
'Now,' I said, 'what can I do for you?'

37
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,670
'I need help,' said the girl slowly. 'But
I don't know if you will be able to help me.

38
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,669
Are you a real private detective?'

39
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,799
'Of course I am,' I replied angrily. 'Didn't
you see the notice on the office door? It

40
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,570
says "L. Samuel. Private Detective." I'm Samuel.
I'm a private eye.'

41
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,280
'All right, Mr Samuel,' the girl said coldly.
'There's no need to get angry. I have a little

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,620
job for you.'

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,180
'Right,' I said quickly. 'What do you want
me to do?'

44
00:03:44,180 --> 00:04:04,480
'It's very simple really,' the girl replied.
'I want you to find my sister. She has disappeared.'

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,600
CHAPTER TWO
Please Find My Sister

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,180
'I see,' I said. 'Your sister has disappeared.
Have you reported her disappearance to the

47
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,350
police?'

48
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,570
The blonde girl shook her head. She looked
very nervous and was starting to cry.

49
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,260
'No, I haven't told the police,' she said.
'I don't want any trouble with the police.

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,090
I just want you to help find my sister.' She
took a small, pink handkerchief out of her

51
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,070
handbag and dried her eyes.

52
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,780
'All right,' I said. 'Tell me all about your
sister.'

53
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,410
'Her name is Elaine Garfield,' said the girl.

54
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,070
'And what's your name?' I interrupted.

55
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,200
'Helen. Helen Garfield,' she replied. 'My
sister disappeared a week ago. We had arranged

56
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,600
to have dinner together last Monday night,
but she didn't come.'

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,200
'Perhaps your sister didn't come because she
doesn't like the food you cook,' I suggested.

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,500
'Don't try to be funny. I flew all the way
from New York to see her last Monday,' she

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,670
said angrily.

60
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,430
'Oh, so you don't live in Los Angeles, then,'
I said.

61
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,150
'No,' she replied quickly, 'I live in New
York. I flew right across America to see my

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,990
sister, but, when I got here, I discovered
that she had disappeared.'

63
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,460
'How do you know she has disappeared?' I asked.
'Perhaps your sister just forgot about the

64
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,070
dinner.'

65
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,280
The blonde girl took a deep breath.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,460
'Look,' she said, 'Let me finish my story.
If you don't stop asking questions, I'll find

67
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,250
myself another detective.'

68
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,210
'Right,' I said, 'I'm listening.'

69
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,060
'I waited for my sister last Monday evening,
in my hotel,' said the girl. 'But she didn't

70
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,010
come. I telephoned her, but there was no answer.
So the next morning, I went to the office

71
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,390
where she worked. At her office, they said
that she had been to work the day before,

72
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,210
on the Monday. They also told me that she'd
left suddenly, in the middle of the afternoon,

73
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,620
without telling anyone. After that I went
round to her flat, but there was no one there.'

74
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,560
The girl stopped for a minute, and then continued.

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,020
'Mr Samuel,' she said, 'I'm very worried about
my sister. It's not usual for her to disappear

76
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,730
suddenly like this. I'm sure that she's in
danger and I want you to find her.'

77
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:20,310
'All right,' I said. 'It may be easy or it
may be difficult, but I'll find her. But first,

78
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,060
tell me why you've waited six days before
coming to me.'

79
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,000
'That's none of your business,' the girl said.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,950
'OK,' I replied. 'Your sister's name is Elaine
Garfield. What does she look like?'

81
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,340
'Oh, that's easy,' Helen Garfield replied,
'she looks like me. We're twins. Now, Mr Samuel,

82
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,860
how much money do you charge?

83
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,320
'Fifty dollars a day,' I said.

84
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,231
'Very well, Mr Samuel,' said the girl, 'but
fifty dollars a day is a lot of money. I hope

85
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,950
that you will work hard for it.'

86
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,669
'Oh yes,' I replied, with a smile, 'I'll work
very hard. Now give me the address of your

87
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:59,740
sister's flat, and the name of the office
where she works. I'll start work at once.'

88
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,850
The blonde girl wrote the addresses on a piece
of paper and gave me the paper.

89
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,430
'One more thing,' I said. 'Can you give me
your address, too?'

90
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,330
'That won't be necessary,' she replied, as
she picked up her handbag. 'I'll come and

91
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,860
see you again tomorrow afternoon, at five
o'clock. Goodbye, Mr Samuel.' 

92
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,300
Without waiting for an answer, the girl turned
around and walked out of the office.

93
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,920
As I watched her walk out of my office, I
smiled to myself. 'This is better than cleaning

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:45,840
my nails,' I thought. Then I began my work.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,330
CHAPTER THREE
The Manson Building

96
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,250
After the blonde girl had left my office,
I looked at the two addresses which she had

97
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,880
written on the piece of paper. The first was:

98
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,440
Elaine Garfield,

99
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,940
Apartment 716,

100
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,980
Manson Building,

101
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,120
Sunset Place.

102
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,090
The second address was:

103
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,360
Myer and Myer,

104
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,370
Attorneys,

105
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,370
Title-Insurance Building

106
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,460
Putting the paper in my pocket, I got up and
walked towards the door. Then I stopped and

107
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,430
went back to my desk. I opened the top left-hand
drawer and took out my gun, a .38 Smith and

108
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,040
Wesson. Then I put the gun back in the drawer.
I decided that it was safer to leave it behind.

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,389
It's easy to get shot, if you're carrying
a gun.

110
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:34,510
I ran down the stairs, all four floors, and
out into the street. My old grey Chrysler

111
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,370
was outside, so I jumped in and drove off
fast, towards Sunset Place.

112
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,620
The Manson Building was a tall, ugly block
of apartments. I parked the Chrysler outside

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,310
and walked towards the big glass front doors.

114
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,319
'Hey, mister!' a voice said.

115
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:54,019
I continued walking.

116
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:59,410
'Hey, mister!' said the voice again. 'You
can't leave your car there.'

117
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,480
I stopped and turned around. A man in a grey
uniform was standing by the Chrysler.

118
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,720
'Hey, mister!' the man repeated, 'you can't
park your car here.'

119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,829
'Why not?' I asked.

120
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:15,290
'Because only people who live in the Manson
Building can park here,' he replied.

121
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,620
'So,' I said, 'How do you know that I don't
live in the Manson Building?'

122
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,720
'Because I'm the porter,' the man replied.
'I work in the entrance of the building and

123
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,600
let people in and out of the door. I know
everybody here.'

124
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,500
'Right,' I said, 'then please let me in.'

125
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,459
The porter and I walked up to the big glass
front doors and he let me in.

126
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,540
'Who do you want to see?' the porter asked.

127
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,430
'Miss Elaine Garfield,' I said. 'She lives
in Apartment 716.'

128
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,930
'I'm sorry,' the porter replied, 'Miss Garfield
is out.'

129
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,660
'When did she go out?' I asked, trying not
to look interested.

130
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,839
'Mind your own business,' said the porter.
'I'm not going to tell you. And I'm not going

131
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,740
to let you go up to Miss Garfield's apartment,
when she's not there.'

132
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,680
'Why don't you go for a walk?' I said to the
porter and put five dollars in his hand. I

133
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,470
gave the porter the money to make him go away.

134
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,360
The porter shook his head.

135
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,459
'No,' he said.

136
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,910
I gave the porter five dollars more.

137
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,399
'Now go for a long walk,' I said.

138
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,579
The porter went out into the street and I
went up to Apartment 716, Miss Elaine Garfield's

139
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:37,730
apartment.

140
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,179
CHAPTER FOUR
A Very Tidy Apartment

141
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,939
I rang the bell beside the door of Apartment
716 and waited.

142
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,959
There was no answer. I rang again, but there
was still no answer. Then I took a small,

143
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,009
square piece of plastic out of my pocket.
I looked around. I was alone. I pushed the

144
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,720
piece of plastic into the space between the
door and the door frame and moved the plastic

145
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,779
up and down. In a minute, the door opened
and I went into the flat.

146
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:14,790
I stood still and listened. There was silence.
I switched on the light and looked around.

147
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,610
It was a modern apartment. I was standing
in the living-room. Through an open door on

148
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,029
my left, I could see the bedroom which was
very neat and tidy. I looked in the wardrobe

149
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,800
- it was almost empty.

150
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,950
'That's funny,' I thought. 'People who disappear
don't usually take most of their clothes with

151
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,180
them. They only take their clothes if they've
been planning their disappearance for a long

152
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,259
time.'

153
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,850
I walked back into the living-room and searched
it carefully. But I found nothing to explain

154
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,810
Elaine Garfield's disappearance. Then I went
into the kitchen. The kitchen was also very

155
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:53,029
clean and tidy. There were no dirty plates
or cups. There was no old milk in the refrigerator.

156
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,459
Everything was in its place.

157
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,000
'Well,' I thought, 'there's only the bathroom
left to search now.'

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,079
The bathroom, too, was empty and clean. I
walked quickly around the flat, making sure

159
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,600
that I hadn't forgotten anything. I wiped
everything I had touched with my handkerchief,

160
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,510
because I didn't want to leave any fingerprints.
Then I switched off the lights and opened

161
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,259
the door to leave.

162
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:19,689
But I didn't leave. There were two men standing
outside the door. One of them was short and

163
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:25,180
had red hair and a nasty smile. The other
was quite tall and was wearing a hat pulled

164
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,220
down over his face. The one with the hat was
holding a gun and the gun was pointing at

165
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,529
me.

166
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,420
I tried to close the door, but the red-haired
man put his foot out to stop the door closing.

167
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,809
I let go of the door. The door opened and
both the men came in. The one with the hat

168
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,579
was in front and he was still carrying the
gun.

169
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,589
'Hold your hands up in the air,' said the
man with the gun.

170
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,540
Then he turned to the red-haired man.

171
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,910
'See if he's got a gun on him, Jo.'

172
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,980
Jo, the red-haired man, came over towards
me. I waited. When Jo was between me and the

173
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,410
man with the gun, I jumped. I jumped forward
and caught Jo around the neck. I held him

174
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,189
in front of me. The man with the gun couldn't
shoot because he would hit his friend.

175
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:13,139
'Right,' I said to the man with the gun. 'Get
out of the way. I'm leaving now and I'm taking

176
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,059
your friend with me.'

177
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,989
Holding Jo in front of me, I walked slowly
towards the man with the gun. Then something

178
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:21,999
went wrong with my plan.

179
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:26,990
The man with the gun started to laugh. He
put the gun back in his pocket and stood laughing.

180
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,589
'Why are you laughing?' I asked.

181
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,690
'I'm laughing because you're so stupid,' the
man with the gun said and walked up to me.

182
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,850
'Stop,' I said, 'or else I'll...'

183
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,769
'What will you do?' asked the man with the
gun. 'You can't do anything. I'm the one with

184
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,449
the gun.'

185
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:47,819
As he said this, the man leant forward. He
pulled Jo out of my hands and hit me in the

186
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,649
face. I must say that I wasn't expecting to
be hit in the face. It hurt. It hurt even

187
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,040
more when he hit me again and I fell on the
floor. I lay still on the floor, hoping that

188
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,660
the two men would go away. But they didn't
go away. Instead, they picked me up and hit

189
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:25,199
me hard on the head. Everything went black.
I lay on the floor - I was unconscious.

190
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,589
CHAPTER FIVE
Myer and Myer

191
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:35,589
I woke up with a terrible pain in my head.
I was lying on the floor outside the front

192
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:42,269
door of Miss Elaine Garfield's apartment.
I looked around. The man with the gun and

193
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:50,209
his red-haired friend had left. I was alone
and I had a terrible headache. I got up slowly

194
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:55,769
and felt my head gently, to see if there was
any blood. There wasn't any blood, but my

195
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:02,929
head was still very painful. I decided to
go back to the office and go to bed.

196
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,610
There was no sign of the porter at the entrance
to the Manson Building. I walked out of the

197
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,089
door and across to the old grey Chrysler.
I drove slowly back to the office.

198
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,420
The telephone was ringing when I arrived at
the office. I went in quickly and answered

199
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
it.

200
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,269
'Samuel speaking.'

201
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:25,259
'Listen, Samuel,' replied a voice. 'Forget
about Elaine

202
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,299
Garfield. We hurt you a little in her apartment.
If you don't forget all about Elaine Garfield,

203
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,399
we'll hurt you a lot more.'

204
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,999
'Who are you?' I asked.

205
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:39,249
But there was no answer. The man had put down
the telephone.

206
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:44,350
I decided to do what the man had told me.
I would forget all about Elaine Garfield - for

207
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,649
ten hours. After a good night's sleep, I would
look for Elaine Garfield. I would also try

208
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:55,750
to find the man with the gun and his friend,
Jo. I lay down on the hard, low bed and went

209
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,109
straight to sleep.

210
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:02,420
I woke up the next morning at eight o'clock.
I felt my head carefully, but it did not hurt

211
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,519
so much now.

212
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,459
I left the office and went across the street
to the cafe where I usually had breakfast.

213
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:14,290
I drank a glass of orange juice, ate some
fresh toast and drank several cups of coffee.

214
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,920
I read the morning newspapers. There was a
lot of news, but nothing about Miss Elaine

215
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,619
Garfield. I looked at my watch, left the cafe
and walked over to the Chrysler.

216
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:29,869
By nine o'clock, I was outside the Title Insurance
Building. At three minutes past nine, I was

217
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:34,850
standing outside the door of Myer and Myer,
Attorneys. At twenty past nine, I was still

218
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,440
standing outside the door. Nobody had arrived
yet to work. At nine thirty, the first secretary

219
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,269
arrived and, at eighteen minutes to ten, I
was sitting in Mr Myer's office.

220
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:50,699
'Well, Mr Myer,' I said, 'my name's Samuel
and I'm a private detective.'

221
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:56,679
'I'm pleased to meet you,' Mr Myer said politely.
He was about fifty-five years old, with a

222
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,000
grey suit, grey hair and a grey face.

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,399
'Does Miss Elaine Garfield work here?' I asked.

224
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,880
'Yes, she does,' Mr Myer said, 'But she hasn't
been to work since last Monday. Why do you

225
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,330
want to see Elaine?'

226
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,819
'Her sister has asked me to help find her,'
I replied. 'Can you think of anything Elaine

227
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,260
said or did which could explain her disappearance?'

228
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,240
Mr Myer scratched his head.

229
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,699
'No,' he said, 'I'm afraid I can't help you.'

230
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,870
'Who did Elaine work with?' I asked.

231
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,959
Mr Myer looked at me.

232
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,519
'Why do you say, "Who did Elaine work with?"
and not "Who does Elaine work with?" Elaine's

233
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,230
not dead, is she?' he asked.

234
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,210
I looked straight back at Mr Myer.

235
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,470
'I don't know if Elaine is dead or not,' I
said. 'Would you be very sad if she was dead?'

236
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,019
'Yes, of course I would be sad!' Mr Myer replied
angrily. 'Are you trying to suggest that I

237
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,820
know where Elaine is?'

238
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,840
I smiled.

239
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,669
'Now don't get excited, Mr Myer,' I said.
'Can you tell me the name of anyone who works

240
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:01,590
with Elaine - anyone who shares a desk with
her or works in the same room?'

241
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,289
'Yes,' Mr Myer said, 'that's easy. Elaine
shares a room with Suzy Graham.'

242
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,289
I got up.

243
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:13,419
'Thank you very much, Mr Myer,' I said. 'Where
is Suzy Graham's office, please?'

244
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:18,340
'It's along the corridor,' said Mr Myer 'the
third door on the left.'

245
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,309
I thanked Mr Myer again and walked to the
door.

246
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:27,870
'Oh, Mr Samuel,' Mr Myer said, 'I'm sorry
that I got angry, but you understand that

247
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't want...'

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,420
'Yes, I understand,' I interrupted. 'You don't
want dirty private detectives in your nice,

249
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,289
clean office.'

250
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:41,380
I walked out of Mr Myer's office and banged
the door behind me. I walked slowly down the

251
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,700
corridor and knocked on the third door on
the left.

252
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,830
'Come in,' said a voice.

253
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,100
So I went into the room.

254
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,330
'Are you Suzy Graham?' I asked.

255
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,630
'Yes,' said the girl sitting at the desk.
'I'm Suzy.'

256
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,510
I smiled at her. Suzy, was the kind of girl
everyone smiled at. She was small and slim

257
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,590
and had a pair of beautiful, brown eyes.

258
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,799
'What can I do to help you?' Suzy asked.

259
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,010
I smiled again.

260
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,380
'I'd like to ask you some questions, Miss
Graham.'

261
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,930
'Don't call me Miss Graham,' the girl said,
'you can call me Suzy.'

262
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,059
'Well, Suzy,' I said, 'I would like to ask
you some questions about a friend of yours.

263
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,899
Her name is Elaine Garfield.'

264
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,330
Suzy stopped smiling.

265
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,860
'Yes, all right,' she said. 'But I don't want
to talk about Elaine here in the office.'

266
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,200
'Right,' I replied, 'I'll tell you what we'll
do. We'll go out and find a cafe. I'll buy

267
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,710
you a cup of coffee and you can tell me about
Elaine. All right?'

268
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,730
Suzy cheered up and looked much happier.

269
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,470
'I'd like to have a cup of coffee,' she said,
'but Mr Myer might get angry if I leave the

270
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,470
office.'

271
00:19:50,470 --> 00:20:09,500
'Don't worry about Mr Myer,' I said, with
a big smile. 'Mr Myer and I are great friends.'

272
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,870
CHAPTER SIX
Suzy

273
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,679
Suzy put on her coat and we left the office
together. We found a little cafe, just opposite

274
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,560
the Title-Insurance Building.

275
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,259
In the cafe, I told Suzy why I was asking
questions about Elaine Garfield.

276
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,400
'Elaine's twin sister, Helen, thinks that
Elaine has disappeared, and she has asked

277
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,110
me to find Elaine,' I said. 'Helen told me
that she came to Myer and Myer last Tuesday.

278
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,269
She was told that Elaine had left work suddenly,
last Monday afternoon. Is that right?'

279
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:40,269
Suzy nodded.

280
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:46,380
'At least, part of it's right,' she said.
'Elaine was at work last Monday, and she hurried

281
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,289
off in the middle of the afternoon.'

282
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,230
Suzy stopped for a minute, and then she continued.

283
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,210
'But I don't remember seeing Elaine's sister,
Helen, on Tuesday. In fact, I didn't even

284
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,470
know that Elaine had a sister.'

285
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:03,860
'Elaine's sister lives in New York,' I explained.
'Now, can you remember last Monday afternoon?

286
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,269
Did Elaine give any reason for leaving suddenly?'

287
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:12,750
'Oh, yes,' Suzy said, 'Elaine said that she
wasn't feeling well and was going to lie down.'

288
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,220
'Did Elaine receive any visitors or phone
calls last Monday afternoon?' I asked.

289
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:24,000
'No, I don't think so,' said Suzy. 'No wait
a minute, I think ... yes, Elaine did receive

290
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,269
a phone call, just before she left.'

291
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:29,269
I smiled.

292
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,630
'I don't suppose that, by chance, you might
have heard any of the telephone conversation?'

293
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,990
'Certainly not,' Suzy replied, 'I don't listen
to other people's phone calls.'

294
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,929
'Can you think of any reason why Elaine disappeared?'
I asked.

295
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:46,929
'No,' Suzy replied, 'Elaine was always very
friendly with everyone and she didn't seem

296
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,740
to have any troubles.'

297
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,470
'Did Elaine have any special friends, any
men or women she talked about a lot?' I asked.

298
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,600
'No, not really,' Suzy replied. 'Elaine and
I used to be quite friendly and we went out

299
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,870
dancing together a lot. But recently we haven't
been out together at all'

300
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,880
'I understand,' I said, though I really didn't
understand anything at all. 'Can you remember

301
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,440
the last time you went out together? Can you
remember the place you went to?'

302
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,440
'Oh, that's easy,' Suzy said quickly, 'we
went to the Las Cabanas Club. We always went

303
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,559
there. It was about a month ago. We had an
argument there and we haven't gone out together

304
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,559
since.'

305
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,470
'What was the argument about?' I asked.

306
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,830
'It was after midnight,' Suzy explained, 'and
I wanted to go home. But Elaine said she wanted

307
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,659
to stay a bit longer. She said that she had
met a wonderful man and didn't want to leave.

308
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:42,870
I said I was going home and I left Elaine
in the club. After that evening, one thing

309
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,870
led to another.'

310
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:49,330
'What do you mean,' I asked, "...one thing
led to another"?'

311
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,529
Suzy smiled.

312
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,639
'I often spoke to Elaine about the man she
had met. Elaine thought he was wonderful.

313
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,990
I told her that he was no good at all.'

314
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,059
'What did Elaine say when you told her that?'
I asked, with interest.

315
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:08,649
'She became very angry,' replied Suzy. 'We
haven't been out dancing together since then.'

316
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,549
I paid for the coffee.

317
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:15,250
'You've been very helpful, Suzy,' I said,
'and I've only got one more question. Can

318
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,679
you remember the name of the man Elaine Garfield
met at Las Cabanas?'

319
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,669
'Benny Greep,' Suzy said, 'that's his name.
Benny Greep.'

320
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:30,000
'Thank you very much indeed, Suzy,' I said,
with a smile. 'You've been a great help.'

321
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,451
'Not at all,' Suzy said and looked at me with
her beautiful, big, brown eyes. 'If there's

322
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:39,270
anything else I can do for you, just ask.'

323
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,730
I looked straight into her eyes.

324
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,620
'What are you doing tonight?' I asked.

325
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,549
'I'll be at home watching television,' Suzy
replied. 'My boyfriend's a boxer and he's

326
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,570
fighting in a match on television tonight.'

327
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:58,090
'Goodbye, Suzy,' I said and watched her as
she walked back across the street to the Tide-Insurance

328
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:16,320
Building. Her boyfriend was a boxer! That
was just my luck.

329
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,679
CHAPTER SEVEN
Benny Greep

330
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,600
I looked at my watch. It was nearly eleven
o'clock. I went back into the cafe and asked

331
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,720
if I could look at the telephone book. I turned
to "L" and ran my finger down the outside

332
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,539
of the page. Soon, I found the name I was
looking for: "Las Cabanas". I looked more

333
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,990
closely. The address was:

334
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:46,759
Las Cabanas, 232 Golden Drive. Telephone:
323.0313

335
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,129
I left the cafe and walked over to where I
had parked the Chrysler. It wasn't time for

336
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:56,210
lunch yet, so I decided to go and see what
Las Cabanas was like. It took me nearly twenty

337
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,480
minutes to drive there and another ten minutes
to find somewhere to park.

338
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,169
Have you ever seen a night club in the daytime?
It's a very depressing sight. At night, a

339
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:10,770
nightclub seems wonderful. However, at a quarter
to twelve in the morning, it looks old, empty

340
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:17,370
and dirty. The man I met at Las Cabanas looked
old, empty and dirty, too.

341
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,710
I rang the bell for five minutes before he
answered the door. Even then, he didn't open

342
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,529
the door itself. Instead, he opened a small
window in the door.

343
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:30,940
'What do you want?' he asked. 'The club doesn't
open until ten o'clock tonight.'

344
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,610
'I'm looking for someone,' I said, 'someone
called Benny Greep.'

345
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:40,270
'I don't know anyone called Benny Greep,'
the man replied and started to shut the window.

346
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,149
'Wait a minute,' I said and pushed five dollars
through the window.

347
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:46,890
'That's better,' the man said.

348
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,440
And he opened the door and let me in.

349
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,960
I followed him across the dance floor. The
man was a cleaner. He picked up a brush and

350
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,519
began to clean the floor.

351
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,279
'Do you know where I can find Benny Greep?'
I asked the man again.

352
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,620
'If you come back tonight at ten o'clock,
you'll find Benny Greep here,' the man said.

353
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,169
'Benny plays the drums in the band.'

354
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:08,769
I gave the man another five dollars.

355
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,129
'Where can I find Benny now?' I asked.

356
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:15,889
The man picked up a piece of paper from the
floor and wrote an address on it.

357
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,020
I took the paper and left immediately.

358
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,299
As I drove the grey Chrysler away from Las
Cabanas, I looked at the address the cleaner

359
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:25,700
had written:

360
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,799
5314 ARVIEDA STREET

361
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,110
WEST LOS ANGELES

362
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:37,549
5314 Arvieda Street was an old block of apartments.
I gave the porter a couple of dollars and

363
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:42,710
he told me which was Benny Greep's apartment.
I walked up the narrow, dark stairs until

364
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,360
I came to the fifth floor. I was looking for
Apartment 507.

365
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,169
I knocked on the door of Apartment 507 and
waited. There was no answer, so I rang the

366
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:59,230
bell. No answer. I knocked again, hard. There
was still no answer.

367
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:06,059
I pushed against the door and it opened easily.
I waited. There was no sound from the apartment,

368
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:12,070
so I went in. The light was on and the curtains
were drawn. The apartment was very small.

369
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,950
There was one main room, which was used as
the living-room, dining-room and bedroom.

370
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,630
The room had two doors. One of the doors led
into the kitchen and the other into the bathroom.

371
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,899
The main room was very untidy. The table was
covered with dirty plates and glasses and

372
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:34,010
there was a full ashtray lying on the floor.
There was a strange smell in the room.

373
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,090
I looked into the kitchen. The kitchen was
also dirty and untidy. I walked across to

374
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,740
the bathroom and opened the door.

375
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,759
Benny Greep was in the bath. His left hand
was hanging over the side of the bath. The

376
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,610
hand had neatly cut nails, and there was a
gold ring on one finger. The wrist was covered

377
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,220
by a shirt-sleeve, which was rather dirty.
I couldn't see the rest of the arm, because

378
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,470
it was under the water.

379
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,970
Benny Greep's head was just out of the water.
He had a handsome face and quite long, black

380
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,320
hair. His eyes were wide open. The only other
parts of his body out of the water were his

381
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,519
feet. But I couldn't see his toes because
he still had his shoes and socks on. The bath

382
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,080
water was red.

383
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,360
I pulled out the plug in the bath, to let
the water out. When the bath was empty, I

384
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,140
looked at the dead man more closely. He had
been dead for several hours. He had been shot

385
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,701
in the chest and then pushed into the bath.
I looked on the floor by the bath. There was

386
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:37,669
blood there, too, and I was standing in it.
I moved back and cleaned the blood off my

387
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:39,850
shoes with some water.

388
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,170
Then I quickly looked round the main room
again. The dead man's coat was lying on a

389
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,630
chair and I felt in the pockets. I found a
few dollars and a driving licence. The driving

390
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,960
licence had a photograph of the dead man on
it. The licence belonged to Benny Greep, and

391
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,940
the address in the licence was 5314 Arvieda
Street, West Los Angeles. The dead man in

392
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:17,309
the bath was definitely Benny Greep.

393
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,070
CHAPTER EIGHT
Arrested for Murder

394
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,800
I moved around the room and carefully cleaned
everything I had touched. I didn't want to

395
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,590
leave any fingerprints. There was nothing
in the room to connect Benny Greep with Elaine

396
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,559
Garfield. I picked up the telephone and asked
for the police.

397
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,980
'I'm speaking from Apartment 507, 5314 Arivieda
Street,' I said. 'There's a dead man in the

398
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,179
bath.'

399
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,270
'Right,' said the policeman at the other end
of the telephone. 'What's your name?'

400
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,270
I told him.

401
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,679
'Don't touch anything,' the policeman said,
'and stay where you are. A police car will

402
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,899
he there in a few minutes.'

403
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:58,789
I put down the phone and sat down to wait.
Three minutes later, I heard the police car

404
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,299
coming. The car stopped outside the building
and I could hear heavy feet running up the

405
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,929
stairs.

406
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,059
Two policemen walked into the apartment. They
were both wearing ordinary clothes and looked

407
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:14,830
hot and tired. One was about twenty-five years
old, the other about forty.

408
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,049
The older policeman came up to me and showed
me his police papers.

409
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,009
'Where's the body?' he asked.

410
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:26,049
I pointed to the bathroom. Both policemen
went into the bathroom to have a look. The

411
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:29,049
younger one came back first, shaking his head.

412
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,940
'All right,' said the younger policeman, 'why
did you do it?'

413
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,559
'Do what?' I asked in surprise.

414
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,590
'Why did you kill your friend in the bath?'
said the young policeman.

415
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,110
'He wasn't my friend,' I replied.

416
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:47,309
'I don't care if he was your friend or not,'
said the policeman. 'Tell me why you killed,

417
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:48,309
him.'

418
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,490
'I didn't kill him,' I said calmly.

419
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:56,110
'Then what are you doing here?' asked the
older policeman, coming in from the bathroom.

420
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:01,539
'My name's Lenny Samuel,' I explained. 'I'm
a private detective and I came here to talk

421
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:06,899
to Benny Greep. The door was open and so I
came in. I looked in the bathroom and I found

422
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:12,320
the dead man in the bath, so I telephoned
the police. The dead man is Benny Greep.'

423
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,059
'Why did you want to talk to Benny Greep?'
the younger policeman asked.

424
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:19,269
'I'm sorry, I can't answer that,' I replied.

425
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:23,299
'Who are you working for?' asked the older
policeman.

426
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,630
'I'm sorry, I can't answer that either,' I
said. 'As far as I know, Benny Greep's death

427
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,919
doesn't have anything to do with the person
I'm working for.'

428
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,860
'Tell me who you are working for,' shouted
the younger policeman angrily.

429
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,110
'Take it easy,' said the older policeman to
the younger one. 'You stay here until the

430
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,519
other police arrive. I'm going to take Mr
Samuel down to the police station.'

431
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,640
I kept quiet and followed the older policeman
out of the room and down the stairs. Outside

432
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,809
the building, we got into my old Chrysler.
The policeman drove. We were soon at the police

433
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,260
station, where the policeman locked me in
a small room. I sat down on a hard, wooden

434
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,159
chair in the locked room and tried to sleep.

435
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,399
It was no use getting angry or upset at being
arrested for murder. That is something you

436
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,140
have to get used to, if you are a private
detective. It happens all the time.

437
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,559
But I could not sleep. I was thinking about
all the things which had happened since I

438
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,940
had met Helen Garfield the day before. I couldn't
sleep, because several things were worrying

439
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:40,200
me. But I couldn't remember what those things
were.

440
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,940
CHAPTER NINE
Sergeant Murphy

441
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,289
While I was in the police station, I remembered
one of the things which was worrying me. How

442
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:53,659
had Jo and his tall friend known that I was
in Elaine Garfield's apartment? The porter

443
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:58,039
at the Manson Building must have told the
two men. I decided that I would go and talk

444
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,110
to the porter when I left the police station.

445
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:05,499
I sat back in the chair and looked at my watch.
The time was nearly four o'clock.

446
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:10,309
Then I remembered that Helen Garfield was
coming to my office at five o'clock. I would

447
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:12,539
not be there to meet her.

448
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,600
But there was something else that was worrying
me. It wasn't anything important. It was quite

449
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,289
a small thing. But I couldn't remember what
it was.

450
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,080
Suddenly, the door opened and a policeman
came in.

451
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,640
'Stand up,' shouted the policeman. 'Follow
me.'

452
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,270
I stood up and followed the policeman out
of the room and along a corridor. The policeman

453
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,820
stopped, knocked on a door and opened it.

454
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,499
'Are you ready to see the private detective?'
asked the policeman, as he put his head around

455
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:41,860
the door.

456
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,110
Without waiting for an answer, the policeman
opened the door wide and pushed me into the

457
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,240
room. The policeman came into the room and
closed the door behind him.

458
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,250
In the room, there was a man sitting behind
a desk. He was completely bald - he had no

459
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,580
hair at all. He was about fifty-five years
old and his name was Sergeant Murphy. Sergeant

460
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,390
Murphy had spent all his life in the police
and he didn't like private detectives.

461
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,020
Sergeant Murphy sat looking at me. He looked
at me for about five minutes, without saying

462
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,869
anything. I was standing in front of his desk,
looking straight back at him. The silence

463
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:20,690
didn't worry me. In fact, I quite liked it.
The silence was much nicer than questions

464
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,649
about what I'd been doing in Benny Greep's
apartment.

465
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:28,670
'What were you doing in Benny Greep's apartment?'
asked Sergeant Murphy suddenly.

466
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,170
'I wanted to talk to him,' I replied.

467
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:35,370
'Why did you kill Benny Greep?' shouted Sergeant
Murphy suddenly.

468
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,850
'I didn't kill him,' I replied, and I told
Sergeant Murphy the same story that I had

469
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,179
told the policemen in Benny Greep's apartment.

470
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,750
'I don't believe a word of what you've told
me,' said the sergeant. 'Who are you working

471
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,750
for?'

472
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,180
'I'm sorry,' I replied, 'I can't tell you
who I'm working for. As far as I know, Benny

473
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,929
Greep's death has nothing to do with me or
with the person I'm working for.'

474
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:00,810
I stopped and looked at the sergeant. I knew
that what I had just said wasn't true. In

475
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,281
fact, I thought Benny Greep's death was connected
with Elaine Garfield's disappearance. But

476
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:09,210
I couldn't tell the police. Helen Garfield
had said that she didn't want the police to

477
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,010
know about her sister's disappearance.

478
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,210
Sergeant Murphy looked me straight in the
eyes.

479
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:21,040
'I hate all private detectives,' he said slowly,
'and you are the private detective that I

480
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,040
hate the most. I don't think you are telling
me the truth. I think you are hiding things

481
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,121
from me. I think you know more about Benny
Greep's death than you say you do. And you

482
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:34,690
are going to tell me all you know - now.'

483
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,670
'I've already told you all I know,' I replied
quietly.

484
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:44,840
Sergeant Murphy's face went red. The red colour
went up until it covered all of his bald head.

485
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,740
'Don't try to play, games with me,' he shouted.
'Now get out.'

486
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,100
'Can I go home now?' I asked.

487
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,560
'No,' said Sergeant Murphy.

488
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,510
The sergeant told the policeman at the door
to take me back to the small room and lock

489
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,030
me up again.

490
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,081
I went with the policemen and didn't argue.
I don't like arguing with policemen. When

491
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:09,880
I was alone in the room again, I sat down.
I tried to remember the other thing that had

492
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,300
been worrying me earlier. Someone had said
something important, but I could not remember

493
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:29,750
what it was.

494
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,880
CHAPTER TEN
The Yellow Car

495
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,500
I looked at my watch. It was half past five.
I was still at the police station. I'd seen

496
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,700
Sergeant Murphy once more, during the afternoon.
It hadn't been a pleasant meeting. I hadn't

497
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,040
told the sergeant who I was working for. And
I hadn't told him why I'd wanted to talk to

498
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,790
Benny Greep.

499
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,870
Half past five. I wondered if Helen Garfield
was waiting for me at my office.

500
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,430
Suddenly, the door of the room opened and
Sergeant Murphy came in.

501
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:06,440
'Get out,' he said, 'I've decided to let you
go. Now go before I change my mind.'

502
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,990
I went before Sergeant Murphy changed his
mind. As I got my car out of the police garage,

503
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,680
I wondered why Sergeant Murphy had let me
go.

504
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,130
As I drove away from the police station, I
noticed a small yellow car behind me. A minute

505
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,981
later, I looked in the mirror again. The small
yellow car was still behind me. I drove a

506
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:31,540
little faster and then suddenly turned right
up a narrow street. At the end of the narrow

507
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,150
street, I turned left and then left again.
Soon, I was back on the main road. I looked

508
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,040
in the mirror. The yellow car was still right
behind me.

509
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,570
So that was why Sergeant Murphy had let me
go. The sergeant had ordered some policemen

510
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:49,310
to follow me. They were going to watch what
I did and who I met.

511
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,750
I drove straight back to the office. As I
parked the car outside, I noticed the yellow

512
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,500
car had stopped across the road. I ran up
the stairs and into my office. The door to

513
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,740
the outer room was open, as usual, but the
room was empty.

514
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,120
Helen Garfield wasn't, there. But there was
a letter on the table, on top of the magazines.

515
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,590
I picked the letter up and read it.

516
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,000
Dear Mr. Samuel,

517
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,610
I came here at five o'clock and waited but
you didn't come. I must see you urgently.

518
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:25,200
Meet me at has Cabanas at 11.30 tonight.

519
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Helen Garfield.

520
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,920
I put the letter in my pocket and looked at
my watch. It was just after six o'clock. I

521
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,570
had five and a half hours before the meeting
with Helen Garfield. There was plenty of time

522
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,880
to go to the Mansion Building and talk to
the porter. I got into the Chrysler and drove

523
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,640
off towards the Mansion Building. The small
yellow car was still following me. As I drove,

524
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,820
I thought about Helen Garfield's letter.

525
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:55,360
'Why does she want to meet me at Las Cabanas?'
I asked myself. 'In fact, how does she know

526
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,310
about Las Cabanas at all? She says that she
lives in New York.'

527
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,490
I would have to ask Miss Helen Garfield a
few questions, the next time I saw her.

528
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,900
But the most important thing now was to get
away from the yellow car, which was still

529
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,340
following me. I was going to the building
where Elaine Garfield lived and I didn't want

530
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,440
the police to know.

531
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,070
There were two men in the yellow car. I turned
right and the yellow car followed. I stopped

532
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:26,170
and the yellow car stopped. I turned the Chrysler
around and the yellow car turned around. I

533
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,900
tried to drive faster than the yellow car,
but the Chrysler was too old and too slow.

534
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,390
I slowed down and waited until I was near
the next traffic lights. Then, just as the

535
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:40,120
lights were changing from green to red, I
drove across them. The yellow car was too

536
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,530
late. The lights were now red. But that didn't
stop the car. It drove straight past the red

537
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,530
light.

538
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:52,280
Then, as I looked angrily in my mirror, something
happened which made me laugh. A policeman

539
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,521
on a motorbike drove after the yellow car.
The policeman made the driver stop, because

540
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,060
he had driven past the red light.

541
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,970
I drove away as fast as possible. In my mirror,
I could see the driver inside the car arguing

542
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:11,530
with the policeman on the motorbike. It was
the funniest sight I had seen for a long time.

543
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,780
I drove on towards the Manson Building, happy
to have escaped. I may even have sung a little,

544
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:32,330
because I was feeling so good.

545
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:37,330
CHAPTER ELEVEN
A Short Visit to the Manson Building

546
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,000
As I was driving happily towards the Manson
Building, I had a surprise. I looked in the

547
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,090
mirror. The yellow car was coming up fast
behind me.

548
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:51,490
I drove as fast as I could, but the yellow
car got closer and closer. Just then, a dog

549
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:56,420
ran across the road, in front of the Chrysler.
I braked hard and the tyres screamed as the

550
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,260
Chrysler stopped suddenly to avoid the dog.
Then there was the scream of more tyres as

551
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,130
the driver of the yellow car tried to stop.

552
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,050
There was a loud crash and a bang, as the
small yellow car ran right into the back of

553
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,370
my big, old, grey Chrysler. The two men in
the yellow car weren't hurt, but their car

554
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:20,210
was badly damaged at the front. Oil and water
were running out onto the road. The old Chrysler

555
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,320
was not damaged at all. I got out and walked
back to the yellow car.

556
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,960
'You ought to be more careful,' I said to
the driver. 'You were driving very dangerously.

557
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,520
It's lucky for you that my car isn't badly
damaged.'

558
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,310
'But...but...,' the driver began to say, but
I did not wait to listen.

559
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:44,530
I ran back to the Chrysler, jumped in and
drove on. The last I saw of the yellow car

560
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,870
was the two men pushing it to the side of
the road.

561
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,320
I was soon at the Manson Building and I went
into the hall, to look for the porter. I couldn't

562
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,180
see him anywhere. Then I noticed a door with
a sign on it saying "Porter". I knocked quietly,

563
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,560
but there was no answer. I opened the door
slowly and looked into the room.

564
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,420
The porter was sitting at his desk, asleep.
His feet were on the desk and he was lying

565
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:14,680
back in his chair. I walked quickly and quietly
into the room and closed the door. I went

566
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,970
up to the desk and noticed a piece of paper
lying by the telephone. There was a telephone

567
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,120
number written on the paper - 3230313.

568
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:32,800
'Las Cabanas,' I said to myself. 'That's the
telephone number of the nightclub.'

569
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,280
Without waking the porter, I left the room.
I had found out what I wanted to know. The

570
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,220
two men who had hit me on the head had probably
come from Las Cabanas. The porter must have

571
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,680
telephoned them when I went up to Elaine Garfield's
flat.

572
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,210
I was now very interested in Las Cabanas.
Elaine Garfield used to go dancing there with

573
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:56,200
Suzy. Benny Greep worked there before he was
killed. Helen Garfield wanted to meet me there

574
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,570
at half past eleven. And now the porter and
the two men who had hit me on the head were

575
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,760
connected with Las Cabanas.

576
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,691
I went home, washed, changed and had a meal.
At eleven o'clock, I went out again. I was

577
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:11,350
going to Las Cabanas.

578
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:15,080
There were lots of cars parked outside and
I had to leave the Chrysler quite a long way

579
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,360
away from the nightclub. As I walked up to
the entrance of Las Cabanas, it started to

580
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,590
rain heavily. I knocked on the door and the
little window in the door opened. A face looked

581
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:31,090
at me for a minute. Then the door opened and
I went in. The club no longer looked empty

582
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:36,780
and dirty. Soft lights and sweet music had
changed the appearance of the club completely.

583
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,880
I stood and looked around. There was a small
dance floor, on which a few people were dancing.

584
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,700
The band was small and not very good. There
was a new drummer instead of Benny Greep.

585
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,100
Around the dance floor, several groups of
people were sitting round low tables. To the

586
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,050
right of the dance floor, there were more
tables where people were eating. There were

587
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,060
two doors behind the tables, which led into
the kitchen. I sat down at a table by the

588
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:28,750
dance floor, in the darkest part of the room,
and waited.

589
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,671
CHAPTER TWELVE
Las Cabanas

590
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:37,330
Exactly at eleven thirty, Helen Garfield came
into the nightclub. She was looking as beautiful

591
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:42,270
as ever, but seemed to be a little worried.
Her blue eyes looked around the room until

592
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,580
she saw me. Then, with a little smile, she
walked up and sat down at the table. She sat

593
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,330
next to me, with her back to the dance floor.
She was carrying a bag, which she put on the

594
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:56,060
floor beside her. The smile disappeared from
her face.

595
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,270
'Where were you this afternoon, Mr Samuel?'
she said sharply. 'I'm paying you fifty dollars

596
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,990
a day. In return for that money, I want you
to do what I tell you. Now why weren't you

597
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,840
at your office this afternoon at five o'clock?'

598
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,290
I took a deep breath.

599
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:16,760
'Well, Miss Garfield,' I said, 'it's a long
story. Let's have a drink and I'll tell you

600
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,990
all about it.'

601
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,140
A waiter came over and I ordered some drinks.

602
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:26,450
When the waiter had gone, the beautiful, blonde
girl said, 'Come on, Mr Samuel, tell me.'

603
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:33,590
'OK,' I said, 'but stop calling me Mr Samuel.
Call me Len - all my friends call me Len.'

604
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:38,540
'I'm not a friend of yours, Mr Samuel,' the
blonde girl said, in a voice like ice. 'I'm

605
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,880
paying you a lot of money to work for me.'

606
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,210
'Fifty dollars a day doesn't allow you to
be rude to me,' I replied quietly. 'In the

607
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,740
last twenty four hours, I've been hit on the
head and suspected of murder.'

608
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:56,140
'What do you mean?' the girl said, and leant
towards me. 'Murder?'

609
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,310
Just then, the waiter brought the drinks and
we sat in silence until he had gone. Then

610
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:04,730
I told Helen Garfield about my visit to her
sister's apartment in the Manson Building.

611
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:09,070
I told her about the two men who had caught
me there. Helen Garfield listened in silence.

612
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,610
'Do you like the band, Miss Garfield?' I asked.

613
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,660
'I didn't come here to talk about the band,'
the blonde girl said angrily.

614
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,900
'The band has got a new drummer tonight,'
I said, 'because I found the old drummer dead

615
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,810
in his bath this morning.'

616
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,960
The blonde girl turned around quickly to look
at the band. She said something to herself

617
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,970
which I didn't hear. She lifted her right
hand and started stroking her hair. She looked

618
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,820
sad and very worried.

619
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:44,210
'What...what was the drummer ...the dead man's
name?' Helen Garfield asked.

620
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:50,330
'Greep,' I said, 'Benny Greep. I don't suppose
that you know Benny Greep, do you?'

621
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,400
Helen Garfield shook her head.

622
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,050
'No,' she said.

623
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,000
I told her what had happened at the police
station. Then I told her about the policemen

624
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,040
who had followed me in a yellow car.

625
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,480
'Do you think they're still following you?'
the blonde girl asked quickly and looked around

626
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
the club.

627
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,020
I told her how I had got away from the yellow
car.

628
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:14,680
'Now, Miss Garfield,' I continued, 'it's time
for me to ask you a few questions. There are

629
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,490
some things about your sister's disappearance
which worry me. I want to ask you about them.'

630
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:24,630
'All right,' she said, 'but I don't think
I can help you. I don't know much about Elaine's

631
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,770
life here. I don't know very much about Los
Angeles, either.'

632
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:33,550
I sat back in my chair and looked at her.
This beautiful, blonde girl was paying me

633
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:40,560
fifty dollars a day to find her sister. I
liked what I saw. Then, very quietly, I began

634
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,830
to ask Helen Garfield some questions.

635
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:47,190
'You don't know Los Angeles very well?' I
began.

636
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,820
'That's right,' the girl replied.

637
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,430
'But you were able to find out where Elaine
worked,' I continued. 'And you went to Myer

638
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,690
and Myer last Tuesday, to ask if they knew
anything about Elaine.'

639
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,660
'Yes,' the girl said, looking at me closely.

640
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,580
'Who did you speak to at Myer and Myer?' I
asked. 'Suzy?'

641
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,750
'No,' the girl said, 'I spoke to Mr Myer.'

642
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,900
'I want to ask you something else,' I said.
'When I went to Elaine's flat, I noticed something

643
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:20,020
unusual. There were very few clothes in the
wardrobe. It seems your sister planned her

644
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:24,610
disappearance quite carefully. She had taken
her clothes with her.'

645
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,330
'I see,' the girl said and looked around the
nightclub.

646
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,340
I waited until she looked back at me.

647
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,660
'Do you like it here?' I asked.

648
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,130
'Yes,' she said.

649
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,860
'I like it, too,' I said, 'But there's something
else which is worrying me. Do you mind if

650
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,990
I ask you one more question?'

651
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,700
'Not at all,' the girl said.

652
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:52,780
'Well,' I began, 'I've been wondering why
you asked me to meet you here, at Las Cabanas.'

653
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,280
Helen Garfield pushed back her chair and stood
up.

654
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,160
'Would you please excuse me for a minute?'
she said.

655
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,030
She picked her bag up from the floor and walked
over towards the ladies' toilet, which was

656
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,070
near the entrance.

657
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,670
'Would you like another drink?' I shouted
after her.

658
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:13,510
'Yes, please,' she shouted back, over her
shoulder. I ordered two more drinks and sat

659
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:31,590
back in my chair. I looked around the nightclub.
It was almost midnight.

660
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,850
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Helen Garfield Leaves

661
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,940
I sat by the dance floor in Las Cabanas, waiting
for Helen Garfield to come back from the toilet.

662
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,290
I was waiting for her to answer my question.
I wanted to know why she had asked me to meet

663
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,910
her here. I looked around at the people who
were dancing.

664
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,881
On the other side of the dance floor, I could
see people sitting eating at the tables. Waiters

665
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:58,170
were carrying food in and out of the two doors
leading to the kitchen.

666
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:04,960
I looked at my watch again. It was five past
twelve. Helen Garfield was taking a long time.

667
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,060
I finished my drink and ordered another one.

668
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:12,940
At ten past twelve, I got up and walked over
towards the entrance. There was a man standing

669
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,870
by the front door of the nightclub. I asked
him if he had seen Helen.

670
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,290
'The beautiful blonde with blue eyes?' the
man asked.

671
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,480
'Yes,' I said.

672
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,750
'She left nearly a quarter of an hour ago,'
said the man.

673
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,830
'Are you sure?' I asked.

674
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:33,640
'Yes,' the man replied. 'She asked me to get
her a taxi.'

675
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,450
'Did you hear her give the taxi driver an
address?' I asked quickly.

676
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,050
The man shook his head.

677
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,320
'No,' he said, 'I'm sorry.'

678
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,670
I thanked the man and walked back to my seat.

679
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,540
Why did Helen Garfield leave without telling
me? I asked myself. Perhaps some of the questions

680
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,500
that I asked made her angry.

681
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,590
Just then, I looked up and saw a man walking
across the dance floor towards me. I recognised

682
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:04,850
the man. He was short, with red hair. He was
looking at me and smiling in a rather unfriendly

683
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:09,970
way. It was Jo - one of the men who had found
me in Elaine Garfield's apartment.

684
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,770
I decided to leave. I stood up and started
to walk towards the door. I didn't want to

685
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:20,870
meet Jo again. As I walked towards the door,
I thought that I heard someone shouting.

686
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,090
'Excuse me, sir,' said a voice.

687
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,870
I didn't stop or look around. Then I heard
the voice again.

688
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,510
'Excuse me, sir. You haven't paid your bill.'

689
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,870
I had forgotten to pay for the drinks. The
waiter came running up to me and I quickly

690
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,550
took out ten dollars and gave them to the
waiter.

691
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,450
'You can keep the change,' I said as I gave
him the money.ну

692
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,820
Without waiting for a reply, I turned and
hurried towards the door.

693
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,600
Then I heard the waiter's voice again.

694
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,590
'Excuse me, sir, excuse me, sir,' he said.

695
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,770
I stopped and turned around. The waiter came
up to me.

696
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:58,220
'Excuse me, sir, ten dollars is not enough,'
he said, 'The price of your drinks is twelve

697
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,220
dollars.'

698
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:04,840
'Las Cabanas is very expensive,' I said, as
I gave the waiter another five dollars. 'Now,

699
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,000
you can keep the change.'

700
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,480
Then I stopped thinking about money. Jo was
walking quickly towards me. I turned around

701
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,970
and ran towards the door as fast as I could.
I got to the door and was just about to leave

702
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,610
Las Cabanas. I was happy because I had escaped.

703
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:27,250
Then I got a surprise. There, standing by
the door of the nightclub, was Jo's tall friend.

704
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:31,400
It was the same man who had hit me on the
head in Miss Garfield's apartment. The tall

705
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:50,720
man had seen me coming and had moved in front
of the door. Now, I couldn't get out.

706
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,150
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Fight

707
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:59,200
I stopped and looked behind me. Jo was closer
now and the smile on his face looked very

708
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,290
unfriendly. I was caught. I could not go out
of the door and Jo was right behind me.

709
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:09,800
I turned around quickly and ran towards Jo.
Before he knew what I was doing, I put my

710
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,740
arms around him and started dancing. He was
very surprised and tried to pull away from

711
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,270
me. But he couldn't fight properly. He was
afraid that the other people would notice.

712
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:23,260
I looked over my shoulder and saw the tall
man standing helplessly on the side of the

713
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,320
dance floor. I pushed Jo into the middle of
the dance floor, where there were lots of

714
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,010
other people dancing.

715
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:34,980
Then I felt something sharp touching my back.
It was a knife. 'Stop trying to be funny,

716
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,830
Samuel,' said Jo angrily. 'Stop dancing and
go over to the door or else I'll push this

717
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,580
knife into you.'

718
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,590
We were right in the middle of the dance floor
and a long way from the tall man. Jo was holding

719
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,340
a knife against my back. Some of the other
people around us had stopped dancing. They

720
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,440
were staring in surprise at the sight of two
men dancing together.

721
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,560
I lifted my foot and kicked Jo's leg as hard
as I could. He gave a cry of pain and fell

722
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,140
to the floor. I looked around to see where
I could run to. Jo's tall friend was coming

723
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,930
through the dancers towards me.

724
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,340
I turned around and ran off the dance floor.
I looked back over my shoulder and saw that

725
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,080
both Jo and his friend were following me.

726
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,180
I ran between the tables where people were
eating. The floor was slippery and I fell

727
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,200
over. As I fell, I knocked over a table and
the plates of food and glasses fell on top

728
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
of me.

729
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,060
I got up quickly and ran out through one of
the doors into the kitchen. Then I stopped

730
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,160
and counted to five.

731
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,680
As Jo and his tall friend were coming towards
the door, I pushed the door closed as hard

732
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,690
as I could. There was a loud bang as the men
ran into the door.

733
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:44,600
I smiled and turned round. But I did not smile
for very long. Three cooks were coming towards

734
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,120
me with big kitchen knives in their hands.

735
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,300
I looked at the cooks and at the knives they
were holding. I thought about running towards

736
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,460
them and trying to fight them. I decided that
it would be a stupid idea to try and fight

737
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,730
three big men with knives.

738
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:02,810
To my left, there was a very big saucepan
full of boiling soup on the stove. I picked

739
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:07,240
it up and threw it at the cooks. There were
loud cries of pain as the hot soup hit the

740
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,660
three men.

741
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,060
Just then, the door opened behind me. Jo and
his tall friend stood in the doorway, and

742
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,650
the tall man was holding a gun.

743
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:19,510
There was a loud bang as the gun went off.
The bang was followed by a scream of pain

744
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:24,050
from one of the cooks, because the tall man
had shot him in the foot by mistake.

745
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:28,750
I quickly picked up a large pile of dirty
plates and threw them at Jo. He saw the plates

746
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:33,720
coming and he tried to move away. As he moved,
he slipped on the floor and fell onto a pile

747
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,380
of broken plates.

748
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,130
Without waiting, I ran to a door at the back
of the kitchen. The door was locked and I

749
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,490
banged against the door with my shoulder.
The lock broke easily and I pushed the door

750
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:48,430
open. As I ran out into the dark street, I
could still hear the shouts and cries coming

751
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,000
from the Club.

752
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,560
I came to the Chrysler and bent over to open
the door. Just then, there was a noise behind

753
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,650
me. I turned around and saw a man with his
arm raised. Then I felt a terrible pain in

754
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:19,350
my head. Everything went black. I fell to
the ground, unconscious.

755
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:24,220
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Police Station

756
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,770
'Feeling better now?' asked a voice.

757
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:33,210
I opened my eyes and looked around me. I didn't
know where I was. I was lying on something

758
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:36,900
hard and there was a bright light on my eyes.

759
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,490
'Where am I?' I asked.

760
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:44,630
Then I realised where I was. I recognised
the grey walls, the hard furniture and the

761
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:49,080
bright electric lights. I was in the police
station again.

762
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,780
'Feeling better now?' the voice repeated.

763
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,290
I looked at the policeman who was talking
to me.

764
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:01,670
'Yes,' I said very slowly, 'but my head feels
as if it is breaking in half.'

765
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:08,040
'You're lucky to be alive,' said the policeman.
'A police car found you lying in the middle

766
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,630
of the road on Golden Drive. You would have
been hit by passing cars - and probably killed,

767
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,330
if the police car hadn't found you.'

768
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:21,080
I thought for a moment. I wasn't sure how
much the police knew. I didn't want to tell

769
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,720
the police anything they did not already know.

770
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,840
'Yes, I was lucky,' I said. 'By the way, what
was a police car doing on Golden Drive?'

771
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,680
'Oh,' said the policeman, 'there was a big
fight at a nightclub called Las Cabanas. We

772
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,620
had a telephone call to say that there was
a madman in the club. The madman was breaking

773
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:46,210
up all the furniture. A police car was sent
to the nightclub, but the madman escaped before

774
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:50,750
the police arrived. The police car was returning
when it found you lying in the middle of the

775
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:55,630
road. You were very lucky. The car nearly
ran right over you.'

776
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,630
I smiled.

777
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:00,760
'I don't feel very lucky,' I replied. 'In
fact, I feel terrible.'

778
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,130
'Never mind,' said the policeman. 'Can you
walk?'

779
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:10,390
I stood up and walked a few steps. My head
hurt, but otherwise I felt all right.

780
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:13,310
'Yes,' I said, 'I can walk.'

781
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:18,131
'Good,' the policeman said, 'let's walk along
the corridor, then, and have a talk with a

782
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:19,131
friend of yours.'

783
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:25,220
We went along the corridor. The policeman
stopped at a door and knocked. There was a

784
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,900
shout from inside the room and the policeman
opened the door. I walked into the room and

785
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,080
the policeman followed. He shut the door and
stood in front of it.

786
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:39,841
There was only one desk in the room and behind
the desk was a man. He was bald. It was my

787
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:43,380
'old friend', Sergeant Murphy.

788
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:48,930
'Hello, Sergeant Murphy,' I said, trying to
smile. 'How are you feeling tonight?'

789
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,860
Sergeant Murphy didn't smile back at me.

790
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:56,790
'Are you trying to be funny?' he asked. 'It
isn't night, it's morning. You've been unconscious

791
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,790
all night.'

792
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,480
'Oh,' I said.

793
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,700
'Now,' said Sergeant Murphy, 'let's begin.
I want you to tell me why you were lying,

794
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,560
unconscious, in the middle of Golden Drive
at half past twelve last night. You were a

795
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,970
danger to the traffic.'

796
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:18,430
'I thought that the traffic was a danger to
me,' I replied. But the sergeant didn't even

797
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,430
smile.

798
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,820
'I'm waiting for you to tell me what happened,'
said the sergeant.

799
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,810
'Nothing much happened,' I began, 'I spent
part of the evening at Las Cabanas and left

800
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:34,500
just before midnight. I walked back to my
car. Just as I was about to get into the car,

801
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,770
someone hit me over the head. That's the last
I remember.

802
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:42,480
'This policeman,' and I pointed to the one
standing by the door, 'told me that I had

803
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,770
been found in the middle of the road. Someone
must have put me there.'

804
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,610
Sergeant Murphy smiled.

805
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:53,701
'Yes,' he said, 'someone who wanted to kill
you put you in the middle of the road. Someone

806
00:59:53,701 --> 00:59:57,050
was hoping that a car would hit you and kill
you.'

807
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,870
I smiled back at the sergeant.

808
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:03,230
'Can you think of anyone who would want to
kill you?' the sergeant asked me.

809
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:23,650
'Oh, yes,' I replied, 'hundreds of people
would like to kill me, including a few policemen.'

810
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,110
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Tell Me the Truth

811
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:31,920
Did you leave Las Cabanas before midnight?'
asked Sergeant Murphy.

812
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,300
'That's right,' I replied, 'I left the nightclub
just before twelve.'

813
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,750
'So you weren't at Las Cabanas when the big
fight started, just after twelve?' asked the

814
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,750
sergeant.

815
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,920
'Big fight?' I said, trying to sound surprised.

816
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,220
'Don't sound so surprised,' said Sergeant
Murphy angrily. 'We received a telephone call

817
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:56,110
from the owner of Las Cabanas. He said that
just after midnight last night, a tall man

818
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:01,070
with brown hair and brown eyes, called Lenny
Samuel, attacked two of the people at the

819
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,620
club. The owner of the club said that you
'then attacked and injured three cooks. Then

820
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:12,150
you broke over one hundred plates and a table,
and ruined food worth several hundred dollars.'

821
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:16,120
I didn't say anything. I could not think of
anything to say.

822
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:22,071
'Did you really do all that?' Sergeant Murphy
asked, in a different voice. The Sergeant

823
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:27,820
sounded both surprised and pleased. 'Did you
really do all that on your own, or did you

824
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,410
have men to help you?'

825
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:34,900
'I did it all on my own,' I said, beginning
to feel a little proud of myself.

826
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:40,960
'Do you know that you could go to prison for
six months for what you did last night?' the

827
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,380
sergeant asked. He was laughing as he said
it.

828
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,990
I wasn't laughing. I couldn't see anything
funny about six months in prison.

829
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,990
'Look,' Sergeant Murphy said, 'I'm not stupid.'

830
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,650
I agreed with the sergeant that he was not
stupid.

831
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:01,360
'I'm not stupid,' Sergeant Murphy repeated,
'and I know why you were at Las Cabanas last

832
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,470
night. Benny Greep used to work there and
you went to find out about his death.'

833
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:10,820
I agreed with the sergeant again. It seemed
the best thing to do.

834
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:17,580
'Now,' Sergeant Murphy said slowly, 'I'm interested
in Las Cabanas. The club is owned by people

835
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,880
who are criminals. But we can't prove that
they have broken the law. I'm also interested

836
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:29,300
in Benny Creep's murder. Now, what I suggest
is this. Tell me all you know about Las Cabanas

837
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,950
and Benny Greep and I will let you go. If
you tell me all you know, you won't go to

838
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,440
prison for the fight at the nightclub. But
I want the truth, not the lies you told me

839
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,210
yesterday.'

840
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,610
I took a deep breath and started to tell the
sergeant what I knew. I told him about everything

841
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:50,250
except Elaine Garfield. I wasn't sure how
closely Elaine Garfield was connected with

842
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:55,240
Benny Creep's death. So, I told the sergeant
that Helen Garfield, from New York, had asked

843
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,200
me to find out about Las Cabanas.

844
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,580
Sergeant Murphy asked me for Helen Garfield's
address in New York and I said I didn't know

845
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:07,330
it. Then the sergeant asked me where Helen
Garfield was staying in Los Angeles. I said

846
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,770
I didn't know.

847
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:13,670
I told Sergeant Murphy all that I knew about
Benny Greep, except that the drummer had known

848
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:18,390
Elaine Garfield. Then I asked him about the
two men in the yellow car, who had followed

849
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:23,930
me. The sergeant smiled and said that the
two men were policemen. Finally, I told him

850
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:26,650
about the fight at Las Cabanas.

851
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,971
Sergeant Murphy listened to everything. When
I had finished my story, he looked at me in

852
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:32,980
silence for a few moments.

853
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:38,950
'Right, Samuel, I hope that you've told me
the truth, and all the truth. If you've been

854
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:43,040
telling me more lies, I'll make sure that
you go to prison for six months, because of

855
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,840
the fight at Las Cabanas. Now, you can go.'

856
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,840
I stood up.

857
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,210
'Thank you,' I said, with a smile.

858
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:57,160
Sit down, he said, 'and listen. You can go.
But you must promise to tell me anything you

859
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,500
find out about Las Cabanas and about Benny
Greep.'

860
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,150
'I promise,' I said quickly and stood up.

861
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:09,230
Wait a minute, said Sergeant Murphy. 'I've
one more thing to tell you. I'm going to telephone

862
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:14,010
the New York police. I'm going to ask them
to find out all they can about Helen Garfield.

863
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:19,180
If the police in New York discover that you've
told me lies about Helen Garfield, you will

864
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,470
be in very serious trouble.'

865
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,930
I told the sergeant not to worry and thanked
him very much.

866
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:31,280
I left the police station feeling very happy
because Sergeant Murphy had let me go. I called

867
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:48,550
a taxi and went out to Golden Drive to get
the Chrysler.

868
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:52,020
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Telephone Calls

869
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,570
I drove the Chrysler back to the office and
walked up the stairs.

870
01:04:55,570 --> 01:05:00,360
The office looked just the same. There were
no letters for me. I went down to the cafe

871
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,901
and had a late breakfast. As I drank my coffee,
I thought about some of the things Helen Garfield

872
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:09,150
had told me at Las Cabanas before the fight.

873
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:14,100
I decided to check one of the things immediately
and walked over to the telephone. I opened

874
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:19,650
the telephone book and looked under 'M' until
I found the telephone number of Myer and Myer.

875
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,330
I picked up the telephone and dialled the
number.

876
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:28,470
'Myer and Myer, good morning,' said a voice
which I recognised. 'Can I help you?'

877
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:32,880
'Hello, Suzy,' I said, 'this is Len Samuel.
Do you remember me?'

878
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,290
'Of course I remember you,' said Suzy.

879
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:40,580
'Did your boyfriend win his boxing match on
television?' I asked.

880
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:45,040
'No,' Suzy replied, 'and anyway, he's not
my boyfriend any more.'

881
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:50,210
'Really,' I said happily, thinking that perhaps
I could ask Suzy to go for a drink with me.

882
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:56,480
'Yes,' Suzy said, 'the boxer had a fight with
my new boyfriend outside my house last night.'

883
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,340
'And who won?' I asked.

884
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,050
'My new boyfriend,' replied Suzy.

885
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:04,950
'Oh,' I said sadly, 'and what does your new
boyfriend do?'

886
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:11,770
'My new boyfriend's a weight lifter.' Suzy
replied. 'He lifts big weights in competitions.'

887
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:16,630
I was about to say goodbye. Then I remembered
that I had not telephoned to speak to, Suzy.

888
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:19,120
I wanted to speak to her boss, Mr Myer.

889
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,850
'Can I speak to Mr Myer please, Suzy?' I asked.

890
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:28,160
'Right,' Suzy said, 'I'll put you through
to Mr Myer. Goodbye.'

891
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,780
There was a pause and then I heard Mr Myer's
voice.

892
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,180
'Hello, Myer speaking.'

893
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:40,240
'Good morning Mr Myer,' I said, in a deep
voice. I had put my handkerchief over the

894
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,990
telephone, so that Mr Myer would not know
my voice.

895
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:47,640
'This is the police,' I said, 'Sergeant Murphy
speaking.'

896
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,780
I pretended to be Sergeant Murphy so that
Mr Myer would answer my questions.

897
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:56,810
'Good morning,' said Mr Myer. 'What do you
want to ask me about?'

898
01:06:56,810 --> 01:07:02,770
'It's about a girl who works for you,' I said.
'Her name is Elaine Garfield. She has disappeared

899
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:07,860
and we are trying to find her. Elaine's sister,
Helen, came to see you last Tuesday, didn't

900
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:08,860
she?'

901
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:14,570
'No,' said Mr Myer, 'Elaine's sister didn't
come to see me last Tuesday. I didn't know

902
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:19,310
that Elaine had a sister, until a private
detective told me. He said that Elaine's sister

903
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,720
was called Helen.'

904
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,850
The telephone line was very bad and it was
difficult for me to hear what Mr Myer was

905
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,150
saying.

906
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,210
'What did you say?' I asked.

907
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:36,660
'I said that Elaine's sister was called Helen,'
replied Mr Myer. 'The names are very similar,

908
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,760
aren't they?'

909
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,700
Thank you very much, Mr Myer,' I said and
put the telephone down.

910
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:50,400
Mr Myer was right. The names Helen and Elaine
were very similar. Elaine Garfield had disappeared.

911
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,400
And so far, I was the only person who had
met Helen Garfield.

912
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,070
I left the cafe and walked back up to my office.
As I climbed the stairs, I could hear my telephone

913
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:05,570
ringing. I didn't hurry. I walked slowly along
the corridor into my office, and answered

914
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:06,570
the telephone.

915
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:13,670
'Is that Samuel?' a voice said. I recognised
the voice at once. It was Jo.

916
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:17,109
'Yes,' I said, 'this is Len Samuel.'

917
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:23,290
'Listen, Samuel,' Jo said, 'we want Elaine
Garfield and we think you know where she is.

918
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:28,569
We are coming to your office to see you. Wait
for us. Don't go out.'

919
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:34,880
'But I ...' I started, but it was too late.
Jo had put the telephone down.

920
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,790
I sat down at my desk sadly.

921
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:42,160
'Now what's going to happen?' I thought. 'Jo
and his friend will come to see me. They'll

922
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:47,420
ask me if I know where Elaine Garfield is.
But I don't know where she is. I wonder if

923
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,109
they will believe me when I tell them.'

924
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:53,600
The telephone rang again. I picked it up.

925
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,440
'Hello,' I said.

926
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,350
'Hello, Samuel,' said a familiar voice.

927
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,920
'Hello, Sergeant Murphy,' I replied, trying
to sound pleased.

928
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,710
'We've just telephoned New York,' the sergeant
said angrily, 'and the New York police were

929
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:12,850
very helpful. The New York police told us
that there is no such person as Helen Garfield.

930
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:18,460
Helen Garfield does not exist. There is no
one living in New York called Helen Garfield.

931
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:22,500
You were lying when you told me that you were
working for Helen Garfield.'

932
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,520
'But...' I started.

933
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:29,580
'Now, listen,' the sergeant interrupted, 'I
am sending a police car round to your office.

934
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:36,170
I want to see you. Wait for the police car.
Don't go out.'

935
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:41,671
The sergeant put down the telephone and I
sat back in my chair. I was worried. What

936
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:47,470
would happen now? Jo was coming to see me
and so was a policeman. I tried to think of

937
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:51,800
what I would say to them both. I hoped that
the policeman and Jo would not arrive at the

938
01:09:51,800 --> 01:10:06,020
same time.

939
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:10,190
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
I Find Elaine Garfield

940
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:15,670
The telephone rang again. I was afraid to
answer it. The telephone continued ringing.

941
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,110
Finally, I did answer it.

942
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,890
'Hello,' I said.

943
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:27,140
'Is that Mr Samuel?' asked a voice. It was
Helen Garfield. 'Yes, Miss Garfield,' I replied,

944
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:32,390
'this is Len Samuel speaking.' 'I must see
you,' said Helen Garfield.

945
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:39,210
'Well, I would like to talk to you, too, Miss
Garfield,' I said slowly. 'I think there are

946
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:42,610
a lot of things you and I must talk about.'

947
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:48,260
'Right,' the girl said, 'meet me at the "Seventh
Mann" cafe in five minutes. Do you know where

948
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,480
the cafe is? It's about half a mile from your
office.'

949
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:56,160
'I know the "Seventh Man", 'I replied, 'but
I can't meet you in five minutes, because

950
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,010
I'm expecting visitors.'

951
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,750
'You must come at once, Mr Samuel,' she said.

952
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,770
'But...' I began.

953
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:08,770
It was too late. Helen Garfield had put her
telephone down. I got up from the chair and

954
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:15,010
walked to the door. I decided to go and meet
Helen Garfield. Both Jo and Sergeant Murphy

955
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:20,250
had told me not to go out. But I decided I
would rather talk to Helen Garfield than to

956
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:25,460
the policeman or to Jo. If Jo and the policeman
came when I was out, they could talk to each

957
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,610
other.

958
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:30,720
I left the building and drove the Chrysler
down the road. I was very lucky, because I

959
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,350
was able to park right outside the "Seventh
Mann". I walked into the cafe.

960
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:41,620
Helen Garfield was sitting at a table in the
comer. I walked over and sat down beside her.

961
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:46,670
I asked the waiter for a cup of coffee. I
drank the coffee without saying anything.

962
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:51,310
Then I put the cup down and looked at the
beautiful, blonde girl sitting beside me.

963
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:57,530
'Miss Garfield,' I said, you are a very beautiful
girl, but I think you are a liar. I think

964
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:01,400
that everything you've said to me has been
lies. I don't think you've ever told me the

965
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,700
truth.'

966
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,960
The blonde girl's face slowly became red.
She looked straight at me.

967
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,520
'Mr Samuel,' she said, 'I'm paying you a lot
of money to work for me. I asked you to find

968
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,100
my sister. I didn't ask you to call me a liar.'

969
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:20,111
'Well, Miss Garfield, I think I have found
Elaine Garfield. Would you like me to tell

970
01:12:20,111 --> 01:12:21,660
you where she is?'

971
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:25,250
'Yes,' the blonde girl said, 'where is Elaine?'

972
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:32,070
'She's here in this cafe,' I said. 'Elaine
Garfield is sitting next to me. You are Elaine

973
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:36,980
Garfield. Helen Garfield doesn't exist. You
pretended to be Helen Garfield, but there

974
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:39,880
really never was any such person.

975
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,900
'The police in New York say that Helen Garfield
doesn't exist,' I went on. 'Helen Garfield

976
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:51,150
and Elaine Garfield are the same person. You
are Elaine Garfield and you pretended to be

977
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,150
Helen.'

978
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,400
The blonde girl stood up angrily.

979
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,840
'How much money do you want, Mr Samuel? You
are no longer working for me,' she shouted.

980
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,630
'Sit down,' I said quietly.

981
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:06,090
The blonde girl did not sit down, so I pulled
her down beside me.

982
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:11,040
'Now listen, Miss Garfield,' I said firmly.
'You are going to tell me all about yourself

983
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,361
and why you came to see me. I want to know
all about Benny Creep and Las Cabanas. I want

984
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:18,170
to know why you disappeared.'

985
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:20,450
'I won't tell you anything,' she said.

986
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:25,290
'Oh, yes, you will tell me everything,' I
replied, 'you'll tell me everything or else

987
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:29,570
I'll take you straight to the police. You
see, the police are looking for me at this

988
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,570
moment.

989
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:34,820
'The police think that I may have killed Benny
Greep,' I continued. 'The police know that

990
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:39,270
I had a fight at Las Cabanas last night. A
red haired man and his tall friend are also

991
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:43,990
chasing me. They are the two men who started
the fight at Las Cabanas. They will try to

992
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:48,200
kill me if I don't tell them where you are.
So you see, Miss Garfield, I think you had

993
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,620
better tell me everything. I'm the only person
who can help you.'

994
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:57,930
The blonde girl sat in silence for a minute.
Then she began to cry.

995
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:17,750
'All right,' she said, 'I'll tell you everything.
I am Elaine Garfield.'

996
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:22,020
CHAPTER NINETEEN
Everything Is Explained

997
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,820
I looked at the blonde girl.

998
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:30,200
'So you agree that you're really Elaine Garfield
and not Helen,' I said quietly. 'Now tell

999
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,210
me about Benny Greep.'

1000
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,280
The girl took a deep breath.

1001
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:40,090
'Suzy Graham and I used to go out dancing
together a lot,' said Elaine. 'We often went

1002
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:46,170
to Las Cabanas. One night when we were there,
I met a wonderful man called Benny. Benny

1003
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:50,900
was the drummer in the band. I liked him very
much and went to the nightclub very often,

1004
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,950
to see Benny. We became very good friends.'

1005
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:57,660
The girl stopped again and took out her handkerchief.

1006
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,880
'Go on,' I said quietly.

1007
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:06,420
'I used to go to Las Cabanas to see Benny
nearly every night, but it was difficult for

1008
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,540
us to talk to each other,' the girl continued.

1009
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,960
'Why was it difficult for you and Benny to
talk to each other?' I asked.

1010
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,640
'Because Benny was the drummer in the band,
of course,'

1011
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,810
Elaine Garfield replied. 'We couldn't talk
to each other very much, because he was playing

1012
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,770
with the band most of the evening.'

1013
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,510
'I understand,' I said and ordered two more
coffees.

1014
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:32,020
'So I spent a lot of time in Las Cabanas,
watching Benny play the drums,' the girl said.

1015
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:35,340
'And I also watched everything else which
happened in the nightclub.'

1016
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,560
'What did you see?' I asked.

1017
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,840
'I didn't notice anything unusual at first,'
the girl replied. 'But, after a few nights,

1018
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,840
I noticed that the same people always came
to the club, at the same time.'

1019
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,840
'Which people?' I asked.

1020
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,540
'There was a red-haired man, a tall man who
never took off his hat, and one or two others,'

1021
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,880
said Elaine Garfield.

1022
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:00,480
'Yes,' I said, 'I think I have met two of
them. They were the men who hit me on the

1023
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,410
head in the Manson Building.'

1024
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:07,170
'Anyway,' the girl continued, 'one night,
I asked Benny why these men came to the club

1025
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:12,750
every night. Benny told me not to ask questions.
So I watched the men more carefully afterwards

1026
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:17,520
and noticed that they always arrived with
bags. But when the men left, they weren't

1027
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,530
carrying bags.'

1028
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,920
'What did you do then?' I asked.

1029
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,980
'I asked Benny about the men again,' she said.
'Benny said that there were a lot of strange

1030
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,840
things happening at Las Cabanas, and that
it was dangerous to ask questions.'

1031
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,640
The waiter brought the coffees and Elaine
waited until he had gone.

1032
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,980
'One night,' she continued, 'one of the men
was sitting at the table next to me. He was

1033
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:44,500
talking to some other men and he opened the
bag that he was carrying. I was sitting quite

1034
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:50,450
close and I could see into the bag. The bag
was full of diamonds and jewellery.'

1035
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:53,070
'Really?' I said and drank my coffee.

1036
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:58,260
'I told Benny about the bag of jewellery,
later on in the evening,' continued Elaine.

1037
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,930
'Benny was very excited at the news.

1038
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:05,600
He told me that he had known for a long time
that criminals used Las Cabanas. They used

1039
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,370
the club as a place to buy and sell stolen
things. Benny and I talked all evening about

1040
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:14,970
the bag of jewellery. Benny said that the
jewellery was stolen. The men who were selling

1041
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:18,240
it were criminals and they had stolen the
jewellery.

1042
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:23,550
'Well,' Elaine continued, 'Benny wanted to
steal one of the bags. He said that the jewellery

1043
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:28,590
was stolen, so it didn't matter if we stole
it from the criminals. I agreed to help him.

1044
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:31,540
We hoped to sell the bag and to use the money
to go away together.'

1045
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:36,730
'I see,' I said, 'and did you help Benny to
steal the bag of jewellery?'

1046
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:42,340
'Yes, we waited for nearly a week,' Elaine
replied. 'Then, last Sunday, I had a chance

1047
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:46,570
to steal the bag. It was at the end of the
evening, and nearly everyone had left the

1048
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:52,280
club. I had found out where they hid the bag
and I was able to take it and give it to Benny.

1049
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:56,360
Benny had big bags in which he carried his
drums. It was easy for him to hide the bag

1050
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,970
of jewellery in the drum bag. We left the
club together, with the bag of jewellery.

1051
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:04,740
We decided to hide the jewellery in my apartment
and then sell it later.

1052
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:10,430
'The next day was Monday,' Elaine continued,
'and I went to work. In the afternoon, I had

1053
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:15,051
a telephone call from Benny. Benny said that
the red-haired man knew that the bag of jewellery

1054
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:20,620
had been stolen. He was very angry. Benny
told me to stop work and go home. He told

1055
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:25,140
me to stay at home, to make sure that no one
came to take the jewels. Benny was going to

1056
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:29,810
continue working at Las Cabanas. Then no one
would think that he had stolen the jewels.'

1057
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,430
'And did you stay at home?' I asked.

1058
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:37,470
'Yes, I stayed at home for three days,' Elaine
replied. 'But I was afraid that the red-haired

1059
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:41,990
man would find out where I was living. Then
he would come to get the bag of jewellery.'

1060
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,350
'So what did you do?' I asked.

1061
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:50,350
'That was easy,' she said, with a smile. 'I
moved into a hotel in the centre of the town

1062
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,710
and then came to see you.'

1063
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:54,920
'But why did you come to see me?' I asked.

1064
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,020
'To make sure that I was safe,' said Elaine.
'I pretended to be my sister and said that

1065
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:05,460
I had disappeared. I asked you to find me.
Then I knew that I was safe.'

1066
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,590
'Why?' I asked.

1067
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:11,940
'Because you were looking for me,' Elaine
continued. 'If the men from Las Cabanas found

1068
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:15,250
me or took me away, you would find out and
chase them.'

1069
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:20,290
'Thank you very much for thinking that I am
such a good detective,' I said. 'But why didn't

1070
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,610
you tell me the truth?'

1071
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:39,860
'That's easy,' said Elaine. 'I didn't want
to tell you about the jewels.'

1072
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,980
CHAPTER TWENTY
I'm Sorry, Mr Samuel

1073
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,500
'Go on with your story,' I said.

1074
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:52,060
'The evening I came to see you at your office,'
said Elaine, 'I telephoned Benny at Las Cabanas.

1075
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:56,550
I told Benny what I had done. Benny told me
that the red-haired man knew that we had stolen

1076
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:00,440
the jewellery. Benny told me that there would
be no trouble if I brought the jewels back

1077
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,090
to Las Cabanas the next night.'

1078
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:06,310
'You were stupid to trust the red-haired man,'
I said.

1079
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:12,790
'I know,' the girl said. 'I was afraid. So
I asked you to meet me at Las Cabanas at midnight'

1080
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:18,370
'So you didn't know that Benny was dead until
I told you at Las Cabanas,' I said.

1081
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:24,090
'No,' Elaine said. 'That is why I ran away
before midnight. I decided not to give them

1082
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:27,100
the jewellery, because they had killed Benny.'

1083
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:32,260
'You've still got the jewels, then?' I asked,
in surprise. 'Where are they?'

1084
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,580
'Here,' Elaine said, and pointed to a small
bag under the table.

1085
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:41,550
I reached under the table, picked up the hag
and opened it. The bag was full of diamonds

1086
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:46,690
and jewellery. Just then I heard a voice and,
at the same time, Elaine screamed.

1087
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:49,750
'Give it to me!' said the voice.

1088
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:55,610
I looked up quickly and saw Jo standing beside
me. His tall friend was right behind him.

1089
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:59,130
'Give me the bag!' said Jo, once again.

1090
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:01,750
'How did you know I was here?' I asked.

1091
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:09,520
'You parked your car right outside,' said
Jo, with a laugh. 'Now, give me the bag.'

1092
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,540
I passed him the bag. As I gave him the bag,
I jumped to my feet and hit Jo hard in the

1093
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:19,840
face. He tripped and fell heavily onto the
floor. I moved towards the tall man, who was

1094
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,650
still standing a few feet away. I was about
to run at him, but then I stopped. The tall

1095
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:29,390
man had taken a gun from his pocket and the
gun was pointing straight at me.

1096
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:34,010
'Right,' said the tall man. 'Don't move or
else I'll shoot you.'

1097
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:38,671
Jo got up from the floor. He still had the
bag of jewellery in his hand. Together, Jo

1098
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:43,110
and his friend with the gun walked towards
the door. They walked backwards, to make sure

1099
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:46,020
that Elaine and I did not try to get the bag
back.

1100
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,930
As the two men reached the door, I started
to laugh.

1101
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:52,770
'What are you laughing at?' shouted the man
with the gun.

1102
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:56,370
'Look behind you,' I said.

1103
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:01,370
Both men turned around and looked. In the
doorway of the cafe stood Sergeant Murphy,

1104
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:06,100
with two other policemen. Sergeant Murphy
jumped on the tall man with the gun and Jo

1105
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:11,250
ran back into the cafe. I stepped forward
to stop Jo and he ran straight into me. We

1106
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:15,891
both fell on the floor and the two policemen
ran up. One of the policemen held Jo. The

1107
01:22:15,891 --> 01:22:17,540
other policeman held me.

1108
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:22,330
'They are the criminals,' I shouted, pointing
at Jo and his friend, 'not me.'

1109
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:29,430
'You are all coming down to the police station,'
Sergeant Murphy said and looked over to Elaine

1110
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:32,850
Garfield. 'You must come, too.'

1111
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:37,870
It took a long time to tell Sergeant Murphy
the whole story. In the end, he believed what

1112
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:42,870
Elaine and I told him. The sergeant warned
me not to tell him lies again, and agreed

1113
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:48,920
to let me go free. Elaine told Sergeant Murphy
all she knew about Las Cabanas. The sergeant

1114
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:53,610
was very pleased to catch Jo and his friend
with the jewels. Sergeant Murphy agreed to

1115
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:57,880
let Elaine go free, because she helped catch
the criminals.

1116
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:02,480
As we were leaving the police station, I asked
Sergeant Murphy how he had found us in the

1117
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,090
"Seventh Man" cafe.

1118
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:09,113
'It was very lucky, really,' said the sergeant.
'We went to your office to see you, but you

1119
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:14,800
weren't there. As we were leaving, we saw
the red-haired man and his friend entering.

1120
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,570
We waited and when they left, we followed
them to the cafe.'

1121
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:24,590
'Thank you very much, Sergeant,' said Elaine.
'And thank you very much, Mr Samuel.'

1122
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:29,970
'That's all right,' I said, 'you are paying
me fifty dollars a day.'

1123
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:35,950
'I'm sorry, Mr Samuel,' Elaine said, 'I'm
afraid I can't pay you. Now that I've given

1124
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:40,670
the jewels to the police, I don't have any
money.'

1125
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:47,870
I smiled and got into the old grey Chrysler
and drove back to the office. I didn't say

1126
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:54,340
goodbye. When I got back to the office, I
sat down in my chair. It's not much fun being

1127
01:23:54,340 --> 01:24:00,790
a private eye. You get hit on the head, nearly
killed, and chased by the police. And you

1128
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:23,520
don't always get paid.

1129
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,040
- THE END -
