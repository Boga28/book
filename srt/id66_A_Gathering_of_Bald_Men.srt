1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,011
Modern life is full of worries - money problems,
your daughter's unsuitable boyfriend, your

2
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:15,449
wife who doesn't understand you, your boss
at work who doesn't listen to your good ideas...

3
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,780
Caleb Zungu is not a happy man.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,170
He sells insurance to people who don't want
to pay for it, he worries about the money

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,590
that he owes the bank - and he discovers he
is going bald.

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:50,210
A man can only take so much...

7
00:00:50,210 --> 00:01:12,640
Caleb Zungu was forty-three years old, married
to Nothando for thirteen years, with two girl

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,980
children - Busi, who was eight, and Khwezi,
who was fourteen.

9
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,770
He owned a house in Johannesburg, a car, and
two dogs.

10
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,790
He was a salesman for a large insurance company,
Allied Life, where he had worked for five

11
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,830
years.

12
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:41,090
He owed money to the bank, and hoped that
God would help him, perhaps with the death

13
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,450
of a long-lost uncle, who would leave him
some money.

14
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,920
Nothando had a full-time job at Transtar,
a bus company.

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:58,460
The girls were on school holidays, as it was
April, and the dogs, which no one called by

16
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,720
their real names, were happy with life.

17
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:13,160
On this Monday, Caleb woke up, took a shower,
brushed his teeth, and put his clothes on.

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:22,360
He looked handsome, and frighteningly well
dressed, in his dark blue suit, white shirt,

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,200
and black shoes.

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,709
He drank his coffee quickly and went back
to the bathroom.

21
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:37,590
Nothando almost dropped her coffee cup when
she heard a scream coming from there.

22
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,890
'Perhaps he's ill!'

23
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,630
she thought, and ran to see what the matter
was.

24
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:51,990
She found Caleb in front of the mirror, feeling
the top of his head with his hand.

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:59,340
He had discovered a bald patch, the size of
a coin, and he was very miserable about it.

26
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,260
'What babies men are!'

27
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,720
thought Nothando.

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,569
To her husband she said kindly, 'But Caleb,
baldness just shows how strong and sexy you

29
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,480
are, every woman knows that!

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,090
You're looking very good today!'

31
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,500
He did not reply.

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:32,040
Later she waved to him as usual as he drove
away in his bright pink car, an old Renault

33
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,270
which he had never found the time to repaint.

34
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:43,840
But she knew that he was still deeply worried,
because he hadn't even taken his mobile phone.

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,270
While she was getting ready for work, she
thought about her daughters.

36
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,510
Khwezi spent too much time talking to her
friends on the phone and listening to her

37
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,200
favourite music.

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,739
Now she'd even written 'I Love JM' on her
trainers.

39
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:09,900
'Who the hell is JM?' thought Nothando.

40
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,590
'Probably one of those awful boys who wait
around on street corners, watching the girls.

41
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:23,540
My daughter is not going to have a boyfriend
like that!'

42
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:30,160
Her helper arrived to take care of the girls,
and Nothando left for work in her friend Marcia's

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
car.

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,310
Now she was thinking about her husband's problem.

45
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,900
'Some men have killed themselves when they've
lost their hair,' she thought.

46
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,520
'What a terrible thing to do!

47
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,190
You've no chance of going to heaven if you
kill yourself.

48
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,690
Surely Caleb isn't thinking about suicide,
is he?

49
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,440
I'll be as angry as hell if he tries something
like that!'

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:12,030
At that moment, Caleb was in the Allied Life
office, where the manager, Arnold Spicer,

51
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,750
was accusing all the salesmen of laziness.

52
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:23,740
'More and more people are growing older,'
he told them, waving his arms angrily.

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,970
'They worry about death, so they need insurance.

54
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:37,280
And you all sit here doing nothing about it,
when you should be out there in the streets,

55
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,710
selling!'

56
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,170
Caleb wished he had a full head of hair, like
Spicer.

57
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,210
'Easy for him to say that,' he thought.

58
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,230
'He doesn't have to go out looking for customers.

59
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,199
It's more difficult for me than the others.

60
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,199
I'm the only one who has to sell insurance
to black people.

61
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,660
Most of them just don't want to pay for it!

62
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:13,000
And the ones who do, well, they make sure
they're never at home when I arrive to collect

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,080
the money every month.

64
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,639
It's not surprising I'm losing my hair.'

65
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,780
And for the first time in many months, he
decided he'd like a drink.

66
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:37,729
As he drove along Empire Road, he tried to
think of famous men who were bald.

67
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:44,110
There was Winston Churchill - some women found
him sexy.

68
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,940
What about Gandhi?

69
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,180
Well, Gandhi was famous for other things.

70
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,650
Bruce Willis?

71
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,810
Was he really hairless?

72
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,830
He was an actor, so perhaps his head was also
acting bald.

73
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:10,330
A bald President Mandela would help - then
people would realize it wasn't so bad to be

74
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:19,130
bald, and lots of men like Caleb would walk
around with their heads held high.

75
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:25,960
He parked his car on Pretoria Street and went
into the bar at the corner.

76
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:33,320
It was early for a drink - only 11.30 in the
morning - but Caleb told himself it was an

77
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,139
unusual day.

78
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:45,009
Inside the bar there was loud African music,
and the low lighting made the place seem mysterious

79
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,570
and a little frightening.

80
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:55,250
Dark men in the shadows spoke quietly to each
other over their drinks, and women in bright

81
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,009
dresses danced with each other.

82
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:02,860
Caleb knew it was a favourite place for criminals.

83
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,580
'Does it have fire insurance?' he wondered.

84
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,699
He chose a table, sat down, and ordered a
beer from the waiter.

85
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,820
The music filled the room, and beat inside
his head.

86
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,960
He was on his third beer, when the dancing
women were beginning to look sexy, and he

87
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,690
started thinking about suicide.

88
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,169
He cried into his glass as he thought of Nothando
and his daughters.

89
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,640
'What will happen to them?

90
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:46,620
There's the money that I owe, and of course
the funeral will cost a lot.

91
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,290
Nothando will have nothing, and the children
will hate me forever.'

92
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,399
But it was just as bad to go on living.

93
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,260
He knew that losing his hair was the beginning
of the end for him.

94
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,520
'If I can't find any more customers, I'll
lose my job,' he thought.

95
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:17,160
'In a few months from now, I could be a beggar
on a street corner, holding a notice that

96
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,800
says "Wife and children hungry.

97
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,320
Please help".

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,220
My daughters would be so ashamed of me!

99
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,190
Yes, death must be better than that.'

100
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:42,100
Already feeling less miserable, he put some
money on the table, and stood up to leave.

101
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,500
It was then that a man entered, and came straight
over to Caleb's table.

102
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:59,740
He was a very thin white man, completely bald,
wearing dirty clothes and an old pair of trainers.

103
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,490
He sat down and said calmly to Caleb, 'Take
a seat, my friend.

104
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,800
You're going nowhere.'

105
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,040
'What do you mean?' asked Caleb.

106
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:20,620
He had no idea why he was doing it, but he
obeyed the man and sat down.

107
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,170
'You were thinking of suicide, weren't you?'

108
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,940
the man said.

109
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,830
'I followed you here.

110
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,210
I told myself, "He's going to do it."'

111
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,630
He laughed; it was not a pleasant sound.

112
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,480
Then he turned and shouted at the waiter,
'Bring me a beer, double-quick!'

113
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,800
'Forget it, Ranger,' the waiter shouted back.

114
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,080
'I'm not even giving you a glass of water
until I see some money first!'

115
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,850
'Who says I need to pay?'

116
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,640
the man called Ranger replied.

117
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,670
'My friend here' - and he put a thin hand
on Caleb's shoulder - 'is about to kill himself-'

118
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,370
'Now, wait a minute-' Caleb began.

119
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,080
'And it's very stupid to die with money in
your pocket, don't you think?'

120
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,640
Ranger was enjoying himself.

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,980
People were laughing; even the dancers stopped
for a moment, to look at this fool who wanted

122
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,690
to take his money with him when he died.

123
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,200
'What's your name, friend?'

124
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,950
Ranger said.

125
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,350
Caleb knew it was time to tell Ranger to get
lost.

126
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,760
He stood up, then saw the notice that the
white man was carrying.

127
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,100
TOM RANGER BLIND SOLDIER

128
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,580
DON'T NEED YOUR PITY BUT MONEY WILL DO

129
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,560
I DRINK AND SMOKE JUST LIKE YOU

130
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,240
'My God!' said Caleb.

131
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,930
'Blind - oh, I'm sorry.'

132
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,100
'Well,' said Ranger carelessly, 'I'm sorry
too.

133
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,140
Now am I getting my drink, or what?'

134
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,760
Caleb called to the waiter.

135
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,380
'Give the man what he wants, and I'll have
another beer.'

136
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,030
Turning back to Ranger, he said, 'My name
is Caleb Zungu.'

137
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:35,690
'And what do you do, Caleb Zungu?' asked Ranger.

138
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,589
'You're some kind of salesman, aren't you?'

139
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,029
'Yes, I sell insurance.

140
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,610
Does it show?'

141
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:55,400
'Man,' Ranger said, 'when I came in through
that door, I got this strong feeling of sadness,

142
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,250
and I knew there was someone here thinking
of suicide.

143
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,990
When you're blind, you feel these things,
man.'

144
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:13,029
Ranger would try to get money out of him,
Caleb knew that, but in an honest way.

145
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:19,760
The streets of Johannesburg were full of beggars,
and people with quick and easy ways to make

146
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,140
quick and easy money.

147
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:28,670
Caleb never gave them anything, but there
was something about Ranger that interested

148
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,670
him.

149
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:37,079
As Caleb and Ranger talked about life and
death over their drinks, the bar became more

150
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,300
and more crowded.

151
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,740
Several men recognized Ranger, and smiled
or waved at him.

152
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,180
Ranger became louder, until Caleb told him
to be quiet.

153
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,680
'A blind man who can see what I'm feeling!'

154
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,220
thought Caleb.

155
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,940
Something made him think about Allied Life.

156
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,660
'They're blind too.

157
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,390
Spicer refuses to accept any of my great ideas
for selling more insurance.

158
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,440
He just makes my working life impossible.

159
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:24,790
Still, if I kill myself, Spicer and Allied
Life won't matter to me anymore.

160
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,899
I won't miss them, where I'm going!'

161
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,040
He was sure there was life after death.

162
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,930
'I don't understand,' Ranger was saying.

163
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,060
'You want to kill yourself just because you're
losing your hair?'

164
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,630
'Isn't that enough?' asked Caleb.

165
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,350
He didn't want to talk about his problems
at work or about the money that he owed.

166
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,780
'I've helped many people kill themselves,
and they've usually had stronger reasons than

167
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,269
that.

168
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,829
There was a man who was jealous of his wife...'

169
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:09,290
Caleb had once suspected Nothando of seeing
another man.

170
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:17,700
Luckily, two of his best friends told him
not to be a fool - Nothando was a good woman.

171
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:24,920
He had started following her, hoping to catch
her in flagrante delicto - caught in the act

172
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,709
of having sex with a lover.

173
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:34,310
He knew he was quite drunk by now because
he was thinking in Latin, but he drank some

174
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,500
more beer anyway.

175
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:44,019
Next time he had an idea to suggest to Spicer,
he'd do it in Latin, and see how Spicer liked

176
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,389
that!

177
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,050
'So do you want me to help you?'

178
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,250
Ranger asked.

179
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,690
'Yes,' Caleb said.

180
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:01,990
'But don't give me any lessons about the importance
of life, or how my wife and kids will go hungry.

181
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,770
Don't give me that.'

182
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,000
But he needed a plan that would make his death
seem like an accident.

183
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,350
The eyes of his children stared at him from
the bottom of his beer glass.

184
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,730
'How do you wish to die?

185
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,540
There are plenty of ways,' Ranger said cheerfully.

186
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,940
'You know, my dad was a hangman.

187
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,240
He's unemployed now, which is a pity, but
when he was working, he hanged a lot of people.

188
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,459
You die of a broken neck when you're hanged
- did you know that?'

189
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,100
Feeling a little sick, Caleb shook his head.

190
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,279
He stared at his strange friend with renewed
respect.

191
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,800
Ranger was clearly a bit crazy, but he was
also intelligent and had a clever way with

192
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,700
words.

193
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,290
'I'd like to talk like him at dinner parties,'
thought Caleb.

194
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:05,209
'If I hadn't killed myself, I mean.'

195
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:08,289
It was a bright, sunny day when they left
the bar.

196
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:12,269
The streets were crowded.

197
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:22,299
Young men stood around in doorways; on every
corner women sold fruit, vegetables, watches,

198
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:23,829
cassettes.

199
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:32,840
Children ran about, loud music was playing
in shops, the noise of traffic was continuous.

200
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,679
The short walk to the car gave Caleb a strange
feeling.

201
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,940
All these things happening around him, this
was life!

202
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,559
He looked at every single part of it, and
tried to remember it forever.

203
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:57,490
As they got near the car, Caleb asked, 'What
do you do when you're not...?'

204
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,159
He didn't want to say 'begging'.

205
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,450
'Getting money out of you people with eyes?'

206
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,679
Ranger finished for him.

207
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,090
'Playing word games.

208
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,970
My plan was to make a word game in many languages.

209
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,499
I'm still working on one for African languages.'

210
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:22,490
Caleb knew how difficult that would be, so
he said nothing.

211
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,119
'This your car?'

212
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,809
Ranger asked, feeling the shape of the Renault
with his hands.

213
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,700
'Give me the keys, Zungu.'

214
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
'What?'

215
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,630
Caleb didn't think he had heard right.

216
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,119
'I said, give me the keys, I'll drive.'

217
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,779
Ranger's voice sounded stronger now, almost
violent.

218
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:55,749
Caleb didn't like to refuse, and gave him
the keys.

219
00:18:55,749 --> 00:19:01,150
Ranger got into the driver's seat, and unlocked
the passenger door.

220
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:07,820
Caleb got in, and started pulling at his seat
belt.

221
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,030
'No seat belts,' Ranger said.

222
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,669
'You want to die, don't you?'

223
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,980
He started the car, and drove away.

224
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,299
In a few seconds the pink Renault was going
at top speed through the busy streets, and

225
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,629
the rest of the traffic had to get out of
its way.

226
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:37,559
'Used to drive in New York,' Ranger said,
driving straight through a red traffic light.

227
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,830
'Great city to drive in.'

228
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,730
He put his head out of the car window to shout
at a taxi driver.

229
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,200
'What's the matter with you, man?

230
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,399
You blind or something?'

231
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,080
While all this was happening, it was lunch
time at Nothando's office.

232
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,580
Nothando was reading Cosmopolitan magazine
while waiting for her friend Marcia.

233
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,139
Most of the young women who worked for Transtar
had already left the office.

234
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:14,179
They looked forward all morning to their hour
of shopping for clothes; if a manager made

235
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:20,799
them stay at work, they were cross and unhelpful
all afternoon.

236
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:28,730
Marcia suggested going to a restaurant in
Raleigh Street, so they got into her car.

237
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,539
Nothando was feeling very tired.

238
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:38,440
It was hard having to look after two daughters
and go to work.

239
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,730
She was also wondering about Caleb.

240
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,799
'Is he going to be a problem?'

241
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,860
she thought.

242
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:53,099
'It's funny, you marry someone who seems to
be your dream man, then bang!

243
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,769
something suddenly changes him into a fat
old man who just makes you cross!'

244
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:06,090
As Marcia was driving down Raleigh Street,
Nothando saw the pink Renault, speeding out

245
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,340
of Abel into Harrow Street.

246
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,669
She recognized it at once.

247
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,450
Marcia said, 'Isn't that...'

248
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,549
'Yes!

249
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,749
It's Caleb!'

250
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:20,950
Nothando screamed.

251
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,679
She heard the loud shouts of other drivers,
who had to stop or turn off the road, as the

252
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,570
pink Renault drove straight on.

253
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:38,149
Marcia followed the crazy pink car down Harrow
Road, driving at top speed herself.

254
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,309
'Don't worry,' she said.

255
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:42,950
'I used to be a taxi-driver.

256
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,460
I think we can catch him.'

257
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,099
Nothando said nothing, but held on to her
seat.

258
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,950
'Caleb, you fool, why are you doing this?'

259
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,950
she thought angrily.

260
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:04,309
And the answer came to her: he's trying to
kill himself.

261
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:11,799
She suddenly remembered an old friend, Chris,
who had tried to kill himself.

262
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,200
First he'd attempted to hang himself from
the branch of a tree, but it was too close

263
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,309
to the ground.

264
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,220
Then he decided to lie down on the railway
line.

265
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:31,389
He lay there for some time, but that day there
were no trains on that part of the line.

266
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:37,549
In the end he went home, hot and tired, but
still alive.

267
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:45,730
There was a loud crash as the pink Renault
turned into Rissik Street.

268
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:52,789
Nothando couldn't remember when or how she
got out of Marcia's car, but she found herself

269
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,950
running towards Caleb's car.

270
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,349
It had hit a wall, and was badly damaged.

271
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:04,749
Police cars were arriving and drivers were
shouting.

272
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:10,729
Suddenly, Nothando screamed: 'Caaaaaaaaleb!'

273
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:16,950
This cry rang above the noise of the traffic.

274
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:23,119
Frightened birds left the rooftops and flew
into the sky.

275
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,830
Policemen put their hands over their ears
in pain, car salesmen stopped their sales

276
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,250
talk to customers, and the cook in the Chicken
Licken restaurant ran out of his kitchen,

277
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,070
because he thought the end of the world had
come.

278
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:48,940
A policeman, Warrant Officer van Vuuren, pushed
through the crowd to get to the crashed car.

279
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,590
He opened the doors, pulled the two men out,
and laid them on the road.

280
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:01,140
Nothando ran to Caleb, and cleaned the blood
off his face.

281
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,269
Calling his name again and again, she looked
lovingly at him.

282
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:16,019
She knew then that, although he was a fool
and smelt of old beer and dirty socks, she

283
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,320
loved him.

284
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,659
When he opened his eyes and smiled, Nothando
almost cried with happiness.

285
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:31,460
Seconds later she was filled with anger.

286
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,090
She pulled Caleb to his feet, and pushing
him against the car, she began to beat him

287
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,259
with her hands, screaming wildly, 'Youstupidfoolyoustupidfoolyoustupidfool.'

288
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:53,779
At last, tired of this, she threw her arms
around him.

289
00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:01,469
Van Vuuren, who clearly had not read the Police
Handbook on Good Policing, was busy hitting

290
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:08,429
Ranger round the face, saying to him, 'How
many times have I told you to keep out of

291
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:09,909
trouble?

292
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,989
You're giving us white men a bad name!'

293
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:20,889
'Officer,' Caleb said, escaping from Nothando's
arms, 'you can't do that to Ranger.

294
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:23,399
He was only trying to help me.'

295
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,830
Van Vuuren turned and looked at Caleb.

296
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,710
'You stupid fool,' he said.

297
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,989
'You're lucky he didn't kill you.

298
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:38,039
This man has been a problem for us for months!'

299
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:44,720
'Well, we have to remember, he is blind,'
replied Caleb.

300
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
'Blind?'

301
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,580
Van Vuuren laughed, and turned to Ranger.

302
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,940
'Is that your latest idea?

303
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,889
If you try to tell me you're blind, I'll put
your eyes out myself.'

304
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,419
'Ah, come on, officer,' Ranger said calmly.

305
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:04,369
'Don't be unkind.

306
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:09,249
A man has got to live, hasn't he?'

307
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:14,070
The fun was over, and the watching crowd began
to move away.

308
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:20,740
An ambulance came to take the two men to hospital,
and Nothando went with them.

309
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,960
Caleb still couldn't believe that Ranger was
not blind.

310
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,950
He wanted to jump up and beat him round the
head, but he didn't feel strong enough.

311
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:41,779
It was tiring just thinking about the crazy,
crazy things that he and Ranger had done.

312
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:49,529
A month later, Caleb left his job at Allied
Life, and started what he called the Progressive

313
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:54,090
Hairlessness Educational Workshop.

314
00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:00,730
His plan was to get people talking about baldness,
and to help people accept their hairlessness,

315
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,049
not worry about it.

316
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:12,019
PHEW, as it was known, started badly, because
reporters found baldness very funny; they

317
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:18,109
said PHEW wasn't a serious business and it
wouldn't last a month.

318
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:23,799
But Caleb put a lot of hard work into it.

319
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,399
He rang up all his old customers and asked
for their help.

320
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:35,429
He found several famous people who were ready
to speak about their baldness on the radio.

321
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:43,999
Ranger soon joined him, and together they
appeared on television programmes and travelled

322
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:47,529
all over the country.

323
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:54,559
Everywhere they went, they took the PHEW logo
- a picture of a large egg with a confident

324
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,710
smile and 'Proud to be hairless' written in
red below it.

325
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,769
Letters from interested people arrived by

00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:14,330
There was a heated discussion in the newspapers
and on television (by then Caleb had shaved

327
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:23,129
all his hair off and looked completely bald)
- could people with thinning hair join PHEW?

328
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:30,460
By now, baldness was discussed openly, and
many people sent money to PHEW, to keep the

329
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,220
work going.

330
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,629
PHEW became a very successful company.

331
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:46,739
Caleb Zungu was forty-five years old, married
to Nothando for fifteen years, with two girl

332
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:52,899
children - Busi, who was ten, and Khwezi,
who was sixteen.

333
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:59,289
He owned a house in Johannesburg, two cars,
and two dogs.

334
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,369
He was the manager of the PHEW Company.

335
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:07,059
Nothando and Ranger also worked for the company.

336
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:15,059
JM was accepted as a future husband for Khwezi,
and as a worker in the company, because he

337
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,510
had started to lose his hair early.

338
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:35,109
And the two dogs were called by their real
names, Baldy and Beauty.

339
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:49,429
- THE END -
