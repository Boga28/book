1
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,480
I
Patrol Cruiser "IP-T 247" circling out toward

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,400
Pluto on leisurely inspection tour to visit
the outpost miners there, was in no hurry

3
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,520
at all as she loafed along.

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,930
Her six-man crew was taking it very easy,
and easy meant two-man watches, and low speed,

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,540
to watch for the instrument panel and attend
ship into the bargain.

6
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,150
She was about thirty million miles off Pluto,
just beginning to get in touch with some of

7
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:06,120
the larger mining stations out there, when
Buck Kendall's turn at the controls came along.

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,340
Buck Kendall was one of life's little jokes.

9
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,010
When Nature made him, she was absentminded.

10
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,780
Buck stood six feet two in his stocking feet,
with his usual slight stoop in operation.

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,330
When he forgot, and stood up straight, he
loomed about two inches higher.

12
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,980
He had the body and muscles of a dock navvy,
which Nature started out to make.

13
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,750
Then she forgot and added something of the
same stuff she put in Sir Francis Drake.

14
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,000
Maybe that made Old Nature nervous, and she
started adding different things.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
At any rate, Kendall, as finally turned out,
had a brain that put him in the first rank

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,591
of scientists—when he felt like it—the
general constitution of an ostrich and a flair

17
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,490
for gambling.

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,469
The present position was due to such a gamble.

19
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,790
An IP man, a friend of his, had made the mistake
of betting him a thousand dollars he wouldn't

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,970
get beyond a Captain's bars in the Patrol.

21
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,480
Kendall had liked the idea anyway, and adding
a bit of a bet to it made it irresistible.

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,620
So, being a very particular kind of a fool,
the glorious kind which old Nature turns out

23
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,440
now and then, he left a five million dollar
estate on Long Island, Terra, that same evening,

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,240
and joined up in the Patrol.

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,710
The Sir Francis Drake strain had immediately
come forth—and Kendall was having the time

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,230
of his life.

27
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,180
In a six-man cruiser, his real work in the
Interplanetary Patrol had started.

28
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,680
He was still in it—but it was his command
now, and a blue circle on his left sleeve

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,430
gave his lieutenant's rank.

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,489
Buck Kendall had immediately proceeded to
enlist in his command the IP man who had made

31
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:03,040
the mistaken bet, and Rad Cole was on duty
with him now.

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,760
Cole was the technician of the T-247.

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,680
His rank as Technical Engineer was practically
equivalent to Kendall's circle-rank, which

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,090
made the two more comfortable together.

35
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,220
Cole was listening carefully to the signals
coming through from Pluto.

36
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,020
"That," he decided, "sounds like Tad Nichols'
fist.

37
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,290
You can recognize that broken-down truck-horse
trot of his on the key as far away as you

38
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,450
can hear it."

39
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,019
"Is that what it is?"

40
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,040
sighed Buck.

41
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,049
"I thought it was static mushing him at first.

42
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,590
What's he like?"

43
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,810
"Like all the other damn fools who come out
two billion miles to scratch rock, as if there

44
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,900
weren't enough already on the inner planets.

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,439
He's got a rich platinum property.

46
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,800
Sells ninety percent of his output to buy
his power, and the other eleven percent for

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,120
his clothes and food."

48
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,709
"He must be an efficient miner," suggested
Kendall, "to maintain 101% production like

49
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,709
that."

50
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,720
"No, but his bank account is.

51
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,120
He's figured out that's the most economic
level of production.

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,360
If he produces less, he won't be able to pay
for his heating power, and if he produces

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,739
more, his operation power will burn up his
bank account too fast."

54
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,620
"Hmmm—sensible way to figure.

55
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,290
A man after my own heart.

56
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,550
How does he plan to restock his bank account?"

57
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,830
"By mining on Mercury.

58
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,940
He does it regularly—sort of a commuter.

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,280
Out here his power bills eat it up.

60
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,340
On Mercury he goes in for potassium, and sells
the power he collects in cooling his dome,

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
of course.

62
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,260
He's a good miner, and the old fool can make
money down there."

63
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,320
Like any really skilled operator, Cole had
been sending Morse messages while he talked.

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,540
Now he sat quiet waiting for the reply, glancing
at the chronometer.

65
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,450
"I take it he's not after money—just after
fun," suggested Buck.

66
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,570
"Oh, no.

67
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,670
He's after money," replied Cole gravely.

68
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:15,030
"You ask him—he's going to make his eternal
fortune yet by striking a real bed of jovium,

69
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,320
and then he'll retire."

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,230
"Oh, one of that kind."

71
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,600
"They all are," Cole laughed.

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,750
"Eternal hope, and the rest of it."

73
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,750
He listened a moment and went on.

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,410
"But old Nichols is a first-grade engineer.

75
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,160
He wouldn't be able to remake that bankroll
every time if he wasn't.

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,320
You'll see his Dome out there on Pluto—it's
always the best on the planet.

77
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,030
Tip-top shape.

78
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,680
And he's a bit of an experimenter too.

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,110
Ah—he's with us."

80
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,560
Nichols' ragged signals were coming through—or
pounding through.

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,260
They were worse than usual, and at first Kendall
and Cole couldn't make them out.

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,970
Then finally they got them in bursts.

83
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,950
The man was excited, and his bad key-work
made it worse.

84
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,300
"—Randing stopped.

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,880
They got him I think.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,780
He said—th—ship as big—a—nsport.

87
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,330
Said it wa—eaded my—ay.

88
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:33,510
Neutrons—on instruments—he's coming over
the horizon—it's huge—war ship I think—register—instru—neutrons—."

89
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,530
Abruptly the signals were blanked out completely.

90
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,830
Cole and Kendall sat frozen and stiff.

91
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,620
Each looked at the other abruptly, then Kendall
moved.

92
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,970
From the receiver, he ripped out the recording
coil, and instantly jammed it into the analyzer.

93
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,860
He started it through once, then again, then
again, at different tone settings, till he

94
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,140
found a very shrill whine that seemed to clear
up most of Nichols' bad key-work.

95
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,220
"T-247—T-247—Emergency.

96
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,300
Emergency.

97
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,160
Randing reports the—over his horizon.

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,500
Huge—ip—reign manufacture.

99
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Almost spherical.

100
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,470
Randing's stopped.

101
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,440
They got him I think.

102
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,830
He said the ship was as big as a transport.

103
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,600
Said it was headed my way.

104
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,410
Neutrons—ont—gister—instruments.

105
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,950
I think—is h—he's coming over the horizon.

106
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:44,050
It's huge, and a war ship I think—register—instruments—neutrons."

107
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,610
Kendall's finger stabbed out at a button.

108
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,440
Instantly the noise of the other men, wakened
abruptly by the mild shocks, came from behind.

109
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,100
Kendall swung to the controls, and Cole raced
back to the engine room.

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,500
The hundred-foot ship shot suddenly forward
under the thrust of her tail ion-rockets.

111
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,870
A blue-red cloud formed slowly behind her
and expanded.

112
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,960
Talbot appeared, and silently took her over
from Kendall.

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,820
"Stations, men," snapped Kendall.

114
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,200
"Emergency call from a miner of Pluto reporting
a large armed vessel which attacked them."

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,620
Kendall swung back, and eased himself against
the thrusting acceleration of the over-powered

116
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,150
little ship, toward the engine room.

117
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,969
Cole was bending over his apparatus, making
careful check-ups, closing weapon-circuits.

118
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,409
No window gave view of space here; on the
left was the tiny tender's pocket, on the

119
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,720
right, above and below the great water tanks
that fed the ion-rockets, behind the rockets

120
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,250
themselves.

121
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,060
The tungsten metal walls were cold and gray
under the ship lights; the hunched bulks of

122
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,740
the apparatus crowded the tiny room.

123
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Gigantic racked accumulators huddled in the
corners.

124
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,339
Martin and Garnet swung into position in the
fighting-tanks just ahead of the power rooms;

125
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:10,139
Canning slid rapidly through the engine room,
oozed through a tiny door, and took up his

126
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,250
position in the stern-chamber, seated half-over
the great ion-rocket sheath.

127
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,430
"Ready in positions, Captain Kendall," called
the war-pilot as the little green lights appeared

128
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,069
on his board.

129
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:25,800
"Test discharges on maximum," ordered Kendall.

130
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
He turned to Cole.

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
"You start the automatic key?"

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,220
"Right, Captain."

133
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,630
"All shipshape?"

134
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,460
"Right as can be.

135
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,000
Accumulators at thirty-seven per cent, thanks
to the loaf out here.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,709
They ought to pick up our signal back on Jupiter,
he's nearest now.

137
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,910
The station on Europa will get it."

138
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,879
"Talbot—we are only to investigate if the
ship is as reported.

139
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,290
Have you seen any signs of her?"

140
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,490
"No sir, and the signals are blank."

141
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,740
"I'll work from here."

142
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,949
Kendall took his position at the commanding
control.

143
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:02,050
Cole made way for him, and moved to the power
board.

144
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,990
One by one he tested the automatic doors,
the pressure bulkheads.

145
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,120
Kendall watched the instruments as one after
another of the weapons were tested on momentary

146
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,360
full discharge—titanic flames of five million
volt protons.

147
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,800
Then the ship thudded to the chatter of the
Garnell rifles.

148
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,589
Tensely the men watched the planet ahead,
white, yet barely visible in the weak sunlight

149
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,060
so far out.

150
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,740
It was swimming slowly nearer as the tiny
ship gathered speed.

151
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,889
Kendall cast a glance over his detector-instruments.

152
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:41,480
The radio network was undisturbed, the magnetic
and electric fields recognized only the slight

153
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,040
disturbances occasioned by the planet itself.

154
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,279
There was nothing, noth—

155
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:55,670
Five hundred miles away, a gigantic ship came
into instantaneous being.

156
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,899
Simultaneously, and instantaneously, the various
detector systems howled their warnings.

157
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,749
Kendall gasped as the thing appeared on his
view screen, with the scale-lines below.

158
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,420
The scale must be cock-eyed.

159
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,360
They said the ship was fifteen hundred feet
in diameter, and two thousand long!

160
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,499
"Retreat," ordered Kendall, "at maximum acceleration."

161
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:23,040
Talbot was already acting.

162
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,350
The gyroscopes hummed in their castings, and
the motors creaked.

163
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:33,930
The T-247 spun on her axis, and abruptly the
acceleration built up as the ion-rockets began

164
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,930
to shudder.

165
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,259
A faint smell of "heat" began to creep out
of the converter.

166
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,769
Immense "weight" built up, and pressed the
men into their specially designed seats—

167
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:52,660
The gigantic ship across the way turned slowly,
and seemed to stare at the T-247.

168
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,490
Then it darted toward them at incredible speed
till the poor little T-247 seemed to be standing

169
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,230
still, as sailors say.

170
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,440
The stranger was so gigantic now, the screens
could not show all of him.

171
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,629
"God, Buck—he's going to take us!"

172
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:18,629
Simultaneously, the T-247 rolled, and from
her broke every possible stream of destruction.

173
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:24,339
The ion-rocket flames swirled abruptly toward
her, the proton-guns whined their song of

174
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:30,870
death in their housings, and the heavy pounding
shudder of the Garnell guns racked the ship.

175
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,699
Strangely, Kendall suddenly noticed, there
was a stillness in the ship.

176
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:43,210
The guns and the rays were still going—but
the little human sounds seemed abruptly gone.

177
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,860
"Talbot—Garnet—" Only silence answered
him.

178
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,649
Cole looked across at him in sudden white-faced
amazement.

179
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:56,600
"They're gone—" gasped Cole.

180
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,300
Kendall stood paralyzed for thirty seconds.

181
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,170
Then suddenly he seemed to come to life.

182
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,420
"Neutrons!

183
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,639
Neutrons—and water tanks!

184
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,649
Old Nichols was right—" He turned to his
friend.

185
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:11,509
"Cole—the tender—quick."

186
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:13,760
He darted a glance at the screen.

187
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,420
The giant ship still lay alongside.

188
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,990
A wash of ions was curling around her, splitting,
and passing on.

189
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:29,550
The pinprick explosions of the Garnell shells
dotted space around her—but never on her.

190
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,499
Cole was already racing for the tender lock.

191
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:35,560
In an instant Kendall piled in after him.

192
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,899
The tiny ship, scarcely ten feet long, was
powered for flights of only two hours acceleration,

193
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:48,980
and had oxygen for but twenty-four hours for
six men, seventy-two hours for two men—maybe.

194
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,910
The heavy door was slammed shut behind them,
as Cole seated himself at the panel.

195
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,820
He depressed a lever, and a sudden smooth
push shot them away from the T-247.

196
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:06,740
"DON'T!" called Kendall sharply as Cole reached
for the ion-rocket control.

197
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,230
"Douse those lights!"

198
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,610
The ship was dark in dark space.

199
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:18,119
The lighted hull of the T-247 drifted away
from the little tender—further and further

200
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:21,910
till the giant ship on the far side became
visible.

201
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,230
"Not a light—not a sign of fields in operation."

202
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,019
Kendall said, unconsciously speaking softly.

203
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,949
"This thing is so tiny, that it may escape
their observation in the fields of the T-247

204
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:35,660
and Pluto down there.

205
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,639
It's our only hope."

206
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,850
"What happened?

207
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,040
How in the name of the planets did they kill
those men without a sound, without a flash,

208
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,230
and without even warning us, or injuring us?"

209
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,660
"Neutrons—don't you see?"

210
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,589
"Frankly, I don't.

211
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:56,439
I'm no scientist—merely a technician.

212
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,820
Neutrons aren't used in any process I've run
across."

213
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,649
"Well, remember they're uncharged, tiny things.

214
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:07,209
Small as protons, but without electric field.

215
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,889
The result is they pass right through an ordinary
atom without being stopped unless they make

216
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,379
a direct hit.

217
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:19,119
Tungsten, while it has a beautifully high
melting point, is mostly open space, and a

218
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,380
neutron just sails right through it, or any
heavy atom.

219
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,819
Light atoms stop neutrons better—there's
less open space in 'em.

220
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:28,990
Hydrogen is best.

221
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:35,470
Well—a man is made up mostly of light elements,
and a man stops those neutrons—it isn't

222
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,160
surprising it killed those other fellows invisibly,
and without a sound."

223
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,089
"You mean they bathed that ship in neutrons?"

224
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,499
"Shot it full of 'em.

225
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:49,910
Just like our proton guns, only sending neutrons."

226
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,639
"Well, why weren't we killed too?"

227
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,339
"'Water stops neutrons,' I said.

228
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,559
Figure it out."

229
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,170
"The rocket-water tanks—all around us!

230
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,440
Great masses of water—" gasped Cole.

231
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,589
"That saved us?"

232
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,589
"Right.

233
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:11,279
I wonder if they've spotted us."

234
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,540
The stranger ship was moving slowly in relation
to the T-247.

235
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:22,519
Suddenly the motion changed, the stranger
spun—and a giant lock appeared in her side,

236
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,519
opened.

237
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:30,420
The T-247 began to move, floated more and
more rapidly straight for the lock.

238
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,529
Her various weapons had stopped operating
now, the hoppers of the Garnell guns exhausted,

239
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:41,290
the charge of the accumulators aboard the
ship down so low the proton guns had died

240
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,620
out.

241
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,339
"Lord—they're taking the whole ship!"

242
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,839
"Say—Cole, is that any ship you ever heard
of before?

243
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,779
I don't think that's just a pirate!"

244
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,720
"Not a pirate—what then?"

245
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,690
"How'd he get inside our detector screens
so fast?

246
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:06,900
Watch—he'll either leave, or come after
us—" The T-247 had settled inside the lock

247
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,100
now, and the great metal door closed after
it.

248
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,600
The whole patrol ship had been swallowed by
a giant.

249
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,660
Kendall was sketching swiftly on a notebook,
watching the vast ship closely, putting down

250
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,820
a record of its lines, and formation.

251
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,770
He glanced up at it, and then down for a few
more lines, and up at it—

252
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,260
The stranger ship abruptly dwindled.

253
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:38,660
It dwindled with incredible speed, rushing
off along the line of sight at an impossible

254
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,380
velocity, and abruptly clicking out of sight,
like an image on a movie-film that has been

255
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,520
cut, and repaired after the scene that showed
the final disappearance.

256
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,680
"Cole—Cole—did you get that?

257
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,920
Did you see—do you understand what happened?"

258
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,900
Kendall was excitedly shouting now.

259
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,620
"He missed us," Cole sighed.

260
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:08,010
"It's a wonder—hanging out here in space,
with the protector of the T-247's fields gone."

261
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,870
"No, no, you asteroid—that's not it.

262
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,470
He went off faster than light itself!"

263
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,760
"Eh—what?

264
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Faster than light?

265
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,930
That can't be done—"

266
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,650
"He did it, I know he did.

267
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,450
That's how he got inside our screens.

268
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,500
He came inside faster than the warning message
could relay back the information.

269
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,560
Didn't you see him accelerate to an impossible
speed in an impossible time?

270
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,050
Didn't you see how he just vanished as he
exceeded the speed of light, and stopped reflecting

271
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,680
it?

272
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,670
That ship was no ship of this solar system!"

273
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,870
"Where did he come from then?"

274
00:18:50,870 --> 00:19:05,530
"God only knows, but it's a long, long way
off."

275
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:18,450
II
The IP-M-122 picked them up.

276
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:27,910
The M-122 got out there two days later, in
response to the calls the T-247 had sent out.

277
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,590
As soon as she got within ten million miles
of the little tender, she began getting Cole's

278
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,930
signals, and within twelve hours had reached
the tiny thing, located it, and picked it

279
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,930
up.

280
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,770
Captain Jim Warren was in command, one of
the old school commanders of the IP.

281
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:50,080
He listened to Kendall's report, listened
to Cole's tale—and radioed back a report

282
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
of his own.

283
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,490
Space pirates in a large ship had attacked
the T-247, he said, and carried it away.

284
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,770
He advised a close watch.

285
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:05,440
On Pluto, his investigations disclosed nothing
more than the fact that three mines had been

286
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,610
raided, all platinum supplies taken, and the
records and machinery removed.

287
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,450
The M-122 was a fifty-man patrol cruiser,
and Warren felt sure he could handle the menace

288
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,170
alone, and hung around for over two weeks
looking for it.

289
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,680
He saw nothing, and no further reports came
of attack.

290
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Again and again, Kendall tried to convince
him this ship he was hunting was no mere space

291
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,670
pirate, and again and again Warren grunted,
and went on his way.

292
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:43,080
He would not send in any report Kendall made
out, because to do so would add his endorsement

293
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,780
to that report.

294
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,170
He would not take Kendall back, though that
was well within his authority.

295
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,790
In fact, it was a full month before Kendall
again set foot on any of the Minor Planets,

296
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,110
and then it was Mars, the base of the M-122.

297
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,500
Kendall and Cole took passage immediately
on an IP supply ship, and landed in New York

298
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,040
six days later.

299
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,510
At once, Kendall headed for Commander McLaurin's
office.

300
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,560
Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the IP, found
he would have to make regular application

301
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,740
to see McLaurin through a dozen intermediate
officers.

302
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,130
By this time, Kendall was savagely determined
to see McLaurin himself, and see him in the

303
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,140
least possible time.

304
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,910
Cole, too, was beginning to believe in Kendall's
assertion of the stranger ship's extra-systemic

305
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,960
origin.

306
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,810
As yet neither could understand the strange
actions of the machine, its attack on the

307
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,890
Pluto mines, and the capture and theft of
a patrol ship.

308
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:52,280
"There is," said Kendall angrily, "just one
way to see McLaurin and see him quick.

309
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,740
And, by God, I'm going to.

310
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,730
Will you resign with me, Cole?

311
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,230
I'll see him within a week then, I'll bet."

312
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,610
For a minute, Cole hesitated.

313
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,410
Then he shook hands with his friends.

314
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,750
"Today!"

315
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,740
And that day it was.

316
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,030
They resigned, together.

317
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,080
Immediately, Buck Kendall got the machinery
in motion for an interview, working now from

318
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,920
the outside, pulling the strings with the
weight of a hundred million dollar fortune.

319
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,910
Even the IP officers had to pay a bit of attention
when Bernard Kendall, multi-millionaire began

320
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,750
talking and demanding things.

321
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,770
Within a week, Kendall did see McLaurin.

322
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,840
At that time, McLaurin was fifty-three years
old, his crisp hair still black as space,

323
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,340
with scarcely a touch of the gray that appears
in his more recent photographs.

324
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,520
He stood six feet tall, a broad-shouldered,
powerful man, his face grave with lines of

325
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,390
intelligence and character.

326
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,500
There was also a permanent narrowing of the
eyes, from years under the blazing sun of

327
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,540
space.

328
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:07,470
But most of all, while those years in space
had narrowed and set his eyes, they had not

329
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,630
narrowed and set his mind.

330
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,250
An infinitely finer character than old Jim
Warren, his experience in space had taught

331
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:21,640
him always to expect the unexpected, to understand
the incomprehensible as being part of the

332
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,580
unknown and incalculable properties of space
and the worlds that swam in it.

333
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,500
Besides the fine technical education he had
started with, he had acquired a liberal education

334
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,580
in mankind.

335
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,880
When Buck Kendall, straight and powerful,
came into his office with Cole, he recognized

336
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,920
in him a character that would drive steadily
and straight for its goal.

337
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,520
Also, he recognized behind the millionaire
that had succeeded in pulling wires enough

338
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,520
to see him, the scientist who had had more
than one paper published "in an amateur way."

339
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,880
"Dr. Bernard Kendall?"

340
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,200
he asked, rising.

341
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,420
"Yes, sir.

342
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,351
Late Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the IP.

343
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:09,270
I quit and got Cole here to quit with me,
so we could see you."

344
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,150
"Unusual tactics.

345
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,980
I've had several men join up to get an interview
with me."

346
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,670
McLaurin smiled.

347
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,100
"Yes, I can imagine that, but we had to see
you in a hurry.

348
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,260
A hidebound old rapscallion by the name of
Jim Warren picked us up out by Pluto, floating

349
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,890
around in a six-man tender.

350
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,310
We made some reports to him, but he wouldn't
believe, and he wouldn't send them through—so

351
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,870
we had to send ourselves through.

352
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:43,050
Sir, this system is about to be attacked by
some extra-systemic race.

353
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:49,770
The IP-T-247 was so attacked, her crew killed
off, and the ship itself carried away."

354
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,660
"I got the report Captain Jim Warren sent
through, stating it was a gang of space pirates.

355
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,990
Now what makes you believe otherwise?"

356
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:05,540
"That ship that attacked us, attacked with
a neutron gun, a gun that shot neutrons through

357
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,270
the hull of our ship as easily as protons
pass through open space.

358
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,420
Those neutrons killed off four of the crew,
and spared us only because we happened to

359
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,820
be behind the water tanks.

360
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,460
Masses of hydrogen will stop neutrons, so
we lived, and escaped in the tender.

361
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,120
The little tender, lightless, escaped their
observation, and we were picked up.

362
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,270
Now, when the 247 had been picked up, and
locked into their ship, that ship started

363
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,270
accelerating.

364
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,400
It accelerated so fast along my line of sight
that it just dwindled, and—vanished.

365
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,440
It didn't vanish in distance, it vanished
because it exceeded the speed of light."

366
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,860
"Isn't that impossible?"

367
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,320
"Not at all.

368
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,100
It can be done—if you can find some way
of escaping from this space to do it.

369
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,480
Now if you could cut across through a higher
dimension, your projection in this dimension

370
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,170
might easily exceed the speed of light.

371
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,010
For instance, if I could cut directly through
the Earth, at a speed of one thousand miles

372
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,120
an hour, my projection on the surface would
go twelve thousand miles while I was going

373
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,140
eight.

374
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,900
Similar, if you could cut through the four
dimensional space instead of following its

375
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,850
surface, you'd attain a speed greater than
light."

376
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,750
"Might it not still be a space pirate?

377
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,840
That's a lot easier to believe, even allowing
your statement that he exceeded the speed

378
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
of light."

379
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,760
"If you invented a neutron gun which could
kill through tungsten walls without injuring

380
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,950
anything within, a system of accelerating
a ship that didn't affect the inhabitants

381
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,500
of that ship, and a means of exceeding the
speed of light, all within a few months of

382
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,660
each other, would you become a pirate?

383
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,000
I wouldn't, and I don't think any one else
would.

384
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,400
A pirate is a man who seeks adventure and
relief from work.

385
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,780
Given a means of exceeding the speed of light,
I'd get all the adventure I wanted investigating

386
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,980
other planets.

387
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,570
If I didn't have a cent before, I'd have relief
from work by selling it for a few hundred

388
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:16,400
millions—and I'd sell it mighty easily too,
for an invention like that is worth an incalculable

389
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
sum.

390
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,110
Tie to that the value of compensated acceleration,
and no man's going to turn pirate.

391
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,860
He can make more millions selling his inventions
than he can make thousands turning pirate

392
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
with them.

393
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,230
So who'd turn pirate?"

394
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,040
"Right."

395
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
McLaurin nodded.

396
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,970
"I see your point.

397
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:41,910
Now before I'd accept your statements in re
the 'speed of light' thing, I'd want opinions

398
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,490
from some IP physicists."

399
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,820
"Then let's have a conference, because something's
got to be done soon.

400
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,040
I don't know why we haven't heard further
from that fellow."

401
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,450
"Privately—we have," McLaurin said in a
slightly worried tone.

402
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:02,580
"He was detected by the instruments of every
IP observatory I suspect.

403
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,760
We got the reports but didn't know what to
make of them.

404
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,010
They indicated so many funny things, they
were sent in as accidental misreadings of

405
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,130
the instruments.

406
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,570
But since all the observatories reported them,
similar misreadings, at about the same times,

407
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,400
that is with variations of only a few hours,
we thought something must have been up.

408
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,841
The only thing was the phenomena were reported
progressively from Pluto to Neptune, clear

409
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:34,720
across the solar system, in a definite progression,
but at a velocity of crossing that didn't

410
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,110
tie in with any conceivable force.

411
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,320
They crossed faster than the velocity of light.

412
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,190
That ship must have spent about half an hour
off each planet before passing on to the next.

413
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,430
And, accepting your faster-than-light explanation,
we can understand it."

414
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,280
"Then I think you have proof."

415
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,900
"If we have, what would you do about it?"

416
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,470
"Get to work on those 'misreadings' of the
instruments for one thing, and for a second,

417
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,220
and more important, line every IP ship with
paraffin blocks six inches thick."

418
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,250
"Paraffin—why?"

419
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,760
"The easiest form of hydrogen to get.

420
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,510
You can't use solid hydrogen, because that
melts too easily.

421
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,690
Water can be turned into steam too easily,
and requires more work.

422
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,470
Paraffin is a solid that's largely hydrogen.

423
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,890
That's what they've always used on neutrons
since they discovered them.

424
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,430
Confine your paraffin between tungsten walls,
and you'll stop the secondary protons as well

425
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,290
as the neutrons."

426
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,640
"Hmmm—I suppose so.

427
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,960
How about seeing those physicists?"

428
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,150
"I'd like to see them today, sir.

429
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,840
The sooner you get started on this work, the
better it will be for the IP."

430
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,410
"Having seen me, will you join up in the IP
again?" asked McLaurin.

431
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,510
"No, sir, I don't think I will.

432
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:58,180
I have another field you know, in which I
may be more useful.

433
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,030
Cole here's a better technician than fighter—and
a darned good fighter, too—and I think that

434
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,590
an inexperienced space-captain is a lot less
useful than a second-rate physicist at work

435
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,730
in a laboratory.

436
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,310
If we hope to get anywhere, or for that matter,
I suspect, stay anywhere, we'll have to do

437
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,520
a lot of research pretty promptly."

438
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,280
"What's your explanation of that ship?"

439
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:28,060
"One of two things: an inventor of some other
system trying out his latest toy, or an expedition

440
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,960
sent out by a planetary government for exploration.

441
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,510
I favor the latter for two reasons: that ship
was big.

442
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:41,080
No inventor would build a thing that size,
requiring a crew of several hundred men to

443
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,120
try out his invention.

444
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,020
A government would build just about that if
they wanted to send out an expedition.

445
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,820
If it were an inventor, he'd be interested
in meeting other people, to see what they

446
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,090
had in the way of science, and probably he'd
want to do it in a peaceable way.

447
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,440
That fellow wasn't interested in peace, by
any means.

448
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,330
So I think it's a government ship, and an
unfriendly government.

449
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:13,460
They sent that ship out either for scientific
research, for trade research and exploration,

450
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,620
or for acquisitive exploration.

451
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,680
If they were out for scientific research,
they'd proceed as would the inventor, to establish

452
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,580
friendly communication.

453
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,490
If they were out for trade, the same would
apply.

454
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:32,411
If they were out for acquisitive exploration,
they'd investigate the planets, the sun, the

455
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:36,700
people, only to the extent of learning how
best to overcome them.

456
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,260
They'd want to get a sample of our people,
and a sample of our weapons.

457
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,370
They'd want samples of our machinery, our
literature and our technology.

458
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,800
That's exactly what that ship got.

459
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:56,270
"Somebody, somewhere out there in space, either
doesn't like their home, or wants more home.

460
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,400
They've been out looking for one.

461
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,010
I'll bet they sent out hundreds of expeditions
to thousands of nearby stars, gradually going

462
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,300
further and further, seeking a planetary system.

463
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,160
This is probably the one and only one they
found.

464
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,690
It's a good one too.

465
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,900
It has planets at all temperatures, of all
sizes.

466
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,190
It is a fairly compact one, it has a stable
sun that will last far longer than any race

467
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,520
can hope to."

468
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,100
"Hmm—how can there be good and bad planetary
systems?" asked McLaurin.

469
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,180
"I'd never thought of that."

470
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Kendall laughed.

471
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
"Mighty easy.

472
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,120
How'd you like to live on a planet of a Cepheid
Variable?

473
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,340
Pleasant situation, with the radiation flaring
up and down.

474
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,640
How'd you like to live on a planet of Antares?

475
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,050
That blasted sun is so big, to have a comfortable
planet you'd have to be at least ten billion

476
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,710
miles out.

477
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,180
Then if you had an interplanetary commerce,
you'd have to struggle with orbits tens of

478
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,980
billions of miles across instead of mere millions.

479
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:06,310
Further, you'd have a sun so blasted big,
it would take an impossible amount of energy

480
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,250
to lift the ship up from one planet to another.

481
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,900
If your trip was, say, twenty billions of
miles to the next planet, you'd be fighting

482
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,450
a gravity as bad as the solar gravity at Earth
here all the way—no decline with a little

483
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,720
distance like that."

484
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,810
"H-m-m-m—quite true.

485
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,580
Then I should say that Mira would take the
prize.

486
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,240
It's a red giant, and it's an irregular variable.

487
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,680
The sunlight there would be as unstable as
the weather in New England.

488
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,440
It's almost as big as Antares, and it won't
hold still.

489
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,270
Now that would make a bad planetary system."

490
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,290
"It would!"

491
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,290
Kendall laughed.

492
00:33:48,290 --> 00:34:06,310
But as we know—he laughed too soon, and
he shouldn't have used 

493
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,500
the conditional.

494
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:14,629
He should have said, "It does!"

495
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:19,169
III
Gresth Gkae, Commander of Expeditionary Force

496
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:25,380
93, of the Planet Sthor, was returning homeward
with joyful mind.

497
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,379
In the lock of his great ship, lay the T-247.

498
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:36,040
In her cargo holds lay various items of machinery,
mining supplies, foods, and records.

499
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,149
And in her log books lay the records of many
readings on the nine larger planets of a highly

500
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:45,050
satisfactory planetary system.

501
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:52,679
Gresth Gkae had spent no less than three ultra-wearing
years going from one sun to another in a definitely

502
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,220
mapped out section of space.

503
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,880
He had investigated only eleven stars in that
time, eleven stars, progressively further

504
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,950
from the titanic red-flaming sun he knew as
"the" sun.

505
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:12,019
He knew it as "the" sun, and had several other
appellations for it.

506
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:19,430
Mira was so-named by Earthmen because it was
indeed a "wonder" star, in Latin, mirare means

507
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,849
"to wonder."

508
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:25,930
Irregularly, and for no apparent reason it
would change its rate of radiation.

509
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:32,740
So far as those inhabitants of Sthor and her
sister world Asthor knew, there was no reason.

510
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,400
It just did it.

511
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,650
Perhaps with malicious intent to be annoying.

512
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,690
If so, it was exceptionally successful.

513
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,859
Sthor and Asthor experienced, periodically,
a young ice age.

514
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:53,990
When Mira decided to take a rest, Sthor and
Asthor froze up, from the poles most of the

515
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,070
way to the equators.

516
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,210
Then Mira would stretch herself a little,
move about restlessly and Sthor and Asthor

517
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:07,470
would become uninhabitably hot, anywhere within
twenty degrees of the equator.

518
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,150
Those Sthorian people had evolved in a way
that made the conditions endurable for savage

519
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:18,269
or uncivilized people, but when a scientific
civilization with a well-ordered mode of existence

520
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:24,249
tried to establish itself, Mira was all sorts
of a nuisance.

521
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:29,510
Gresth Gkae was a peculiar individual to human
ways of thinking.

522
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:35,470
He stood some seven feet tall, on his strange,
double-kneed legs and his four toed feet.

523
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:40,520
His body was covered with little, short feather-like
things that moved now with a volition of their

524
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,999
own.

525
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,369
They were moving very slowly and regularly.

526
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,970
The space-ship was heated to a comfortable
temperature, and the little fans were helping

527
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,450
to cool Gresth Gkae.

528
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,650
Had it been cold, every little feather would
have lain down close against its neighbors,

529
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,950
forming an admirable, wind-proof and cold-proof
blanket.

530
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,519
Nature, on Sthor, had original ideas of arrangement
too.

531
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:13,450
Sthorians possessed two eyes—one directly
above the other, in the center of their faces.

532
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,519
The face was so long, and narrow, it resembled
a blunt hatchet, with the two eyes on the

533
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,869
edge.

534
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:24,450
To counter-balance this vertical arrangement
of the eyes, the nostrils had been separated

535
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,160
some four inches, with one on each of the
sloping cheeks.

536
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,259
His ears were little pink-flesh cups on short,
muscular stems.

537
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:39,549
His mouth was narrow, and small, but armed
with quite solid teeth adapted to his diet,

538
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:45,920
a diet consisting of almost anything any creature
had ever considered edible.

539
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,510
Like most successful forms of intelligent
life, Gresth Gkae was omnivorous.

540
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,869
An intelligent form of life is necessarily
adaptable, and adaptation meant being able

541
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:00,009
to eat what was at hand.

542
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:04,789
One of his eyes, the upper one, was fully
twice the size of the lower one.

543
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,700
This was his telescopic eye.

544
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,839
The lower, or microscopic eye was adapted
to work for which a human being would have

545
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:18,170
required a low power microscope, the upper
eye possessed a more normal power of vision,

546
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,950
plus considerable telescopic powers.

547
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:27,480
Gresth Gkae was using it now to look ahead
in the blank of space to where gigantic Mira

548
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,050
appeared.

549
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,500
On his screens now, Mira appeared deep violet,
for he was approaching at a speed greater

550
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,569
than that of light, and even this projected
light of Mira was badly distorted.

551
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:44,359
"The distance is half a light-year now, sir,"
reported the navigation officer.

552
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:48,250
"Reduce the speed, then, to normal velocity
for these ranges.

553
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,999
What reserve of fuel have we?"

554
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,779
"Less than one thousand pounds.

555
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,410
We will barely be able to stop.

556
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,599
We were too free in the use of our weapons,
I fear," replied the Chief Technician.

557
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,809
"Well, what would you?

558
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:03,220
We needed those things in our reports.

559
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:09,410
Besides, we could extract fuel from that ore
we took on at Planet Nine of Phahlo.

560
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,480
It is merely that I wish speed in the return."

561
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,430
"As we all do.

562
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,049
How soon do you believe the Council will proceed
against the new system?"

563
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:22,140
"It will be fully a year, I fear.

564
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,349
They must gather the expeditions together,
and re-equip the ships.

565
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:28,740
It will be a long time before all will have
come in."

566
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,220
"Could they not send fast ships after them
to recall them?"

567
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:39,269
"Could they have traced us as we wove our
way from Thart to Karst to Raloork to Phahlo?

568
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,510
It would be impossible."

569
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,950
Steadily the great ship had been boring on
her way.

570
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:52,230
Mira had been a disc for nearly two days,
gigantic, two-hundred-and-fifty-million-mile

571
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:57,240
Mira took a great deal of dwarfing by distance
to lose her disc.

572
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,099
Even at the Twin Planets, eight thousand two
hundred and fifty millions of miles out, Mira

573
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,020
covered half the sky, it seemed, red and angry.

574
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,900
Sometimes, though, to the disgust of the Sthorians
it was just red-faced and lazy.

575
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,759
Then Sthor froze.

576
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:21,369
"Grih is in a descendant stage," said the
navigation officer presently.

577
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:23,540
"Sthor will be cold when we arrive."

578
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,380
"It will warm quickly enough with our news!"

579
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,380
Gresth laughed.

580
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,400
"A system—a delightful system—discovered.

581
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,150
A system of many close-grouped planets.

582
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:41,569
Why think—from one side of that system to
the other is less of a distance than from

583
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:45,799
Ansthat, our first planet's orbit, to Insthor's
orbit!

584
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:49,119
That sun, as we know, is steady and warm.

585
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,210
All will be well, when we have eliminated
that rather peculiar race.

586
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,559
Odd, that they should, in some ways, be so
nearly like us!

587
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,660
Nearly Sthorian in build.

588
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,989
I would not have expected it.

589
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:05,170
Though they did have some amazing peculiarities!

590
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:10,880
Imagine—two eyes just alike, and in a horizontal
row.

591
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,920
And that flat face.

592
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,460
They looked as though they had suffered some
accident that smashed the front of the face

593
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460
in.

594
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,079
And also the peculiar beak-like projection.

595
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,150
Why should a race ever develop so amazing
a projection in so peculiar and exposed a

596
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,380
position?

597
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,980
It sticks out inviting attack and injury.

598
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,359
Right in the middle of the face.

599
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,530
And to make it worse, there is the air-channel,
and the only air channel.

600
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:43,140
Why, one minor injury to the throat would
be certain to damage that passage beyond repair,

601
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,470
and bring death.

602
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,660
Yet such relatively unimportant things as
ears, and eyes are doubled.

603
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,089
Surely you would expect that so important
a member as the air-passage would be doubled

604
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:55,089
for safety.

605
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:59,749
"Those strange, awkward arms and legs were
what puzzled me.

606
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:04,910
I have been attempting to manipulate myself
as they must be forced to, and I cannot see

607
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:10,289
how delicate or accurate manual manipulation
would be possible with those rigid, inflexible

608
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:11,289
arms.

609
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:16,989
In some ways I feel they must have had clever
minds to overcome so great a handicap to constructive

610
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:17,989
work.

611
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:22,940
But I suppose single joints in the arms become
as natural to them as our own more mobile

612
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,130
two.

613
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,500
"I wonder if life in any intelligent form
wouldn't develop somewhat similar formations,

614
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
though.

615
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,940
Think, in all parts of Sthor, before men became
civilized and developed communication, even

616
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,309
so much as twenty thousand years ago, our
records show that seats and chairs were much

617
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:47,119
as they are today, and much as they are, in
all places among all groups.

618
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,640
Then too, the eye has developed in many different
species, and always reached much the same

619
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
structure.

620
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,799
When a thing is intended and developed to
serve a given purpose, no matter who develops

621
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:03,980
it, or where or how, is it not apt to have
similar shapes and parts?

622
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,609
A chair must have legs, and a seat and arm-rests
and a back.

623
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:13,569
You may vary their nature and their shape,
but not widely, and they must be there.

624
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:19,960
An eye must, anywhere, have a sensitive retina,
an adjustable lens, and an adjustable device

625
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,830
for controlling the entrance of light.

626
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:27,019
Similarly there are certain functions that
the body of an intelligent creature must serve

627
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:30,529
which naturally tend to make intelligent creatures
similar.

628
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:33,510
He must have a tool—the hand—"

629
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,160
"Yes, yes—I see your point.

630
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,130
It must be so, for surely these creatures
out there are strange enough in other ways."

631
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,170
"But tell me, have you calculated when we
shall land?"

632
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,109
"In twelve hours, thirty-three minutes, sir."

633
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,809
Eleven hours later, the expedition ship had
slowed to a normal space-speed.

634
00:43:53,809 --> 00:44:02,559
On her left hung the giant globe of Asthor,
rotating slowly, moving slowly in her orbit.

635
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,450
Directly ahead, Sthor loomed even greater.

636
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:12,230
Tiny Teelan, the thousand-mile diameter moon
of the Insthor system shone dull red in the

637
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,540
reflected light of gigantic Mira.

638
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,849
Mira herself was gigantic, red and menacing
across eight and a quarter billions of miles

639
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:23,559
of space.

640
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:29,249
One hundred thousand miles apart, the twin
worlds Sthor and Asthor rotated about their

641
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:34,130
common center of gravity, eternally facing
each other.

642
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:40,520
Ten million miles from their common center
of gravity, Teelan rotated in a vast orbit.

643
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,880
Sthor and Asthor were capped at each pole
now by gigantic white icecaps.

644
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,980
Mira was sulking, and as a consequence the
planets were freezing.

645
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,339
The expedition ship sank slowly toward Sthor.

646
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:59,980
A swarm of smaller craft had flown up at its
approach to meet it.

647
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,130
A gaily-colored small ship marked the official
greeting-ship.

648
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:07,730
Gresth had withheld his news purposely.

649
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:13,109
Now suddenly he began broadcasting it from
the powerful transmitter on his ship.

650
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:18,221
As the words came through on a thousand sets,
all the little ships began to whirl, dance

651
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:21,550
and break out into glowing, sparkling lights.

652
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,569
On Sthor and Asthor even commotions began
to be visible.

653
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:31,690
A new planetary system had been found— They
could move!

654
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,190
Their overflowing populations could be spread
out!

655
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:51,440
The whole Insthor system went mad with delight
as the great Expeditionary Ship settled downward.

656
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:03,470
IV
There was a glint of humor in Buck Kendall's

657
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:07,530
eyes as he passed the sheet over to McLaurin.

658
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,599
Commander McLaurin looked down the columns
with twinkling eyes.

659
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,599
"'Petition to establish the Lunar Mining Bank,'"
he read.

660
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,270
"What a bank!

661
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:24,539
Officers: President, General James Logan,
late of the IP; Vice-president, Colonel Warren

662
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:33,290
Gerardhi, also late of the IP; Staff, consists
of 90% ex-IP men, and a few scattered accountants.

663
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,480
Designed by the well-known designer of IP
stations, Colonel Richard Murray."

664
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,859
Commander McLaurin looked up at Kendall with
a broad grin.

665
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:47,410
"And you actually got Interplanetary Life
to give you a mortgage on the structure?"

666
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,569
"Why not?

667
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:53,740
It'll cut cost fifty-eight millions, with
its twelve-foot tungsten-beryllium walls and

668
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,039
the heavy defense weapons against those terrible
pirates.

669
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,829
You know we must defend our property."

670
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:04,299
"With the thing you're setting up out there
on Luna, you could more readily wipe out the

671
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:06,980
IP than anything else I know of.

672
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,829
Any new defense ideas?"

673
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:09,829
"Plenty.

674
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:14,450
Did you get any further appropriations from
the IP Appropriations Board?"

675
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,970
McLaurin looked sour.

676
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:17,970
"No.

677
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:23,210
The dear taxpayers might object, and those
thickheaded, clogged rockets on the Board

678
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,230
can't see your data on the Stranger.

679
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,890
They gave me just ten millions, and that only
because you demonstrated you could shoot every

680
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,380
living thing out of the latest IP cruiser
with that neutron gun of yours.

681
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,609
By the way, they may kick when I don't install
more than a few of those."

682
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:41,220
"Let 'em.

683
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,339
You can stall for a few months.

684
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:45,880
You'll need that money more for other purposes.

685
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,799
You've installed that paraffin lining?"

686
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:51,480
"Yes—I got a report on that of 'finished'
last week.

687
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,820
How have you made out?"

688
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,650
Buck Kendall's face fell.

689
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,440
"Not so hot.

690
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,040
Devin's been the biggest help—he did most
of the work on that neutron gun really—"

691
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,630
"After," McLaurin interrupted, "you told him
how."

692
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,109
"—but we're pretty well stuck now, it seems.

693
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:12,049
You'll be off duty tomorrow evening, can't
you drop around to the lab?

694
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:16,430
We're going to try out a new system for releasing
atomic energy."

695
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,400
"Isn't that a pretty faint hope?

696
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,510
We've been trying to get it for three centuries
now, and haven't yet.

697
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,220
What chance at it within a year or so?—which
is the time you allow yourself before the

698
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,700
Stranger returns."

699
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,940
"It is, I'll admit that.

700
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,490
But there's another factor, not to be forgotten.

701
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:43,440
The data we got from correlating those 'misreadings'
from the various IP posts mean a lot.

702
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,119
We are working on an entirely different trail
now.

703
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,150
You come on out, and you can see our new apparatus.

704
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,920
They are working on tremendous voltages, and
hoping to smash the thing by a brutal bombardment

705
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,339
of terrific voltage.

706
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:02,160
We're trying, thanks to the results of those
instruments, to get results with small, terrifically

707
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,099
intense fields."

708
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,319
"How do you know that's their general system?"

709
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,839
"They left traces on the records of the post
instruments.

710
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,800
These records show such intensities as we
never got.

711
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:21,239
They have atomic energy, necessarily, and
they might have had material energy, actual

712
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:25,640
destruction of matter, but apparently, from
the field readings it's the former.

713
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,769
To be able to make those tremendous hops,
light-years in length, they needed a real

714
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:32,229
store of energy.

715
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:37,150
They have accumulators, of course, but I don't
think they could store enough power by the

716
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,400
system they use to do it."

717
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,039
"Well, how's your trick 'bank' out on Luna,
despite its twelve-foot walls, going to stand

718
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,829
an atomic explosion?"

719
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:50,529
"More protective devices to come is our only
hope.

720
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:56,619
I'm working on three trails: atomic energy,
some type of magnetic shield that will stop

721
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:00,900
any moving material particle, and their faster-than-light
thing.

722
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:06,549
Also, that fortress—I mean, of course, bank—is
going to have a lot of lead-lined rooms."

723
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:12,150
"I wish I could use the remaining money the
Board gave me to lead-line a lot of those

724
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,799
IP ships," said McLaurin wistfully.

725
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:18,269
"Can't you make a gamma-ray bomb of some sort?"

726
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:20,930
"Not without their atomic energy release.

727
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,710
With it, of course, it's easy to flood a region
with rays.

728
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,109
It'll be a million times worse than radium
'C,' which is bad enough."

729
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:32,200
"Well, I'll send through this petition for
armaments.

730
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,519
They'll pass it all right, I think.

731
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,369
They may get some kicks from old Jacob Ezra
Stubbs.

732
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,229
Jacob Ezra doesn't believe in anything war-like.

733
00:50:41,229 --> 00:50:46,299
I wish they'd find some way to keep him off
of the Arms Petition Board.

734
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:50,749
He might just as well stay home and let 'em
vote his ticket uniformly 'nay.'"

735
00:50:50,749 --> 00:50:54,569
Buck Kendall left with a laugh.

736
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:56,800
Buck Kendall had his troubles though.

737
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,069
When he had reached Earth again, he found
that his properties totaled one hundred and

738
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:03,769
three million dollars, roughly.

739
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,380
One doesn't sell properties of that magnitude,
one borrows against them.

740
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:14,130
But to all intents and purposes, Buck Kendall
owned two half-completed ship's hulls in the

741
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:20,309
Baldwin Spaceship Yards, a great deal of massive
metal work on its way to Luna, and contracts

742
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:23,980
for some very extensive work on a "bank."

743
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,450
Beyond that, about eleven million was left.

744
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,869
A large portion of the money had been invested
in a laboratory, the like of which the world

745
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:34,030
had never seen.

746
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:39,880
It was devoted exclusively to physics, and
principally the physics of destruction.

747
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:46,049
Dr. Paul Devin was the Director, Cole was
in charge of the technical work, and Buck

748
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:49,250
Kendall was free to do all the work he thought
needed doing.

749
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:54,400
Returned to his laboratory, he looked sourly
at the bench on which seven mechanicians were

750
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,599
working.

751
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,390
The ninth successive experiment on the release
of atomic energy had failed.

752
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,789
The tenth was in process of construction.

753
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:08,609
A heavy pure tungsten dome, three feet in
diameter, three inches thick, was being lowered

754
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:12,069
over a clear insulum dome, a foot smaller.

755
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:16,979
Inside, the real apparatus was arranged around
the little pool of mercury.

756
00:52:16,979 --> 00:52:23,980
From it, two massive tungsten-copper alloy
conductors led through the insulum housing,

757
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,309
and outside.

758
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:31,479
These, so Kendall had hoped, would surge with
the power of broken atoms, but he was beginning

759
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:34,930
to believe rather bitterly, they would never
do so.

760
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:39,589
Buck went on to his offices, and the main
calculator room.

761
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,450
There were ten calculator tables here, two
of them in operation now.

762
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,069
"Hello, Devin.

763
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:46,410
Getting on?"

764
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:49,650
"No," said Devin bitterly, "I'm getting off.

765
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,400
Look at these results."

766
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,239
He brought over a sheaf of graphs, with explanatory
tables attached.

767
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,160
Rapidly Buck ran through them with him.

768
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,509
Most of them were graphs of functions of light,
considered as a wave in these experiments.

769
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:07,849
"H-m-m-m—not very encouraging.

770
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:12,299
Looks like you've got the field—but it just
snaps shut on itself and won't work.

771
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:17,119
The lack of volume makes it break down, if
you establish it, and makes it impossible

772
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,009
to establish in the first place without the
energy of matter.

773
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:22,799
Not so hot.

774
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,560
That's certainly cock-eyed somewhere."

775
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,450
"I'm not.

776
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,900
The math may be."

777
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,910
"Well"—Kendall grinned—"it amounts to
the same thing.

778
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,109
The point is, light doesn't.

779
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:36,940
Let's run over that theory again.

780
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,079
Light is not only magnetic; but electric.

781
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,729
Somehow it transforms electric fields cyclically
into magnetic fields and back again.

782
00:53:46,729 --> 00:53:52,520
Now what we want to do is to transform an
electric into a magnetic field and have it

783
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,180
stay there.

784
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,190
That's the first step.

785
00:53:55,190 --> 00:54:00,559
The second thing, is to have the lines of
magnetic force you develop, lie down like

786
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,560
a sheath around the ship, instead of standing
out like the hairs on an angry cat, the way

787
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,010
they want to.

788
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:12,049
That means turning them ninety degrees, and
turning an electric into a magnetic field

789
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:15,910
means turning the space-strain ninety degrees.

790
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:21,150
Light evidently forms a magnetic field whose
lines of force reach along its direction of

791
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,329
motion, so that's your starting point."

792
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:29,930
"Yes, and that," growled Devin, "seems to
be the finishing point.

793
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:34,170
Quite definitely and clearly, the graph looped
down to zero.

794
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:39,160
In other words, the field closed in on itself,
and destroyed itself."

795
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,640
"Light doesn't vanish."

796
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,140
"I'll make you all the lights you want."

797
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,710
"I simply mean there must be something that
will stop it."

798
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,710
"Certainly.

799
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:53,519
Transform it back to electric field before
it gets a chance to close in, then repeat

800
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:55,859
the process—the way light does."

801
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:59,769
"That wouldn't make such a good magnetic shield.

802
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:03,530
Every time that field started pulsing out
through the walls of the ship it would generate

803
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,559
heat.

804
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,489
We want a permanent field that will stay on
the job out there.

805
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:14,049
I wonder if you couldn't make a conductor
device that would open that field out—some

806
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:17,430
special type of oscillating field that would
keep it open."

807
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,549
"H-m-m-m—that's an angle I might try.

808
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:21,640
Any suggestions?"

809
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:27,680
Kendall had suggestions, and rapidly he outlined
a development that appeared from some of the

810
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,390
earlier mathematics on light, and might be
what they wanted.

811
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,380
Kendall, however, had problems of his own
to work on.

812
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,640
The question of atomic energy he was leaving
alone, till the present experiment either

813
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,220
succeeded, or, as he rather suspected, failed
as had its predecessors.

814
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,250
His present problem was to develop more fully
some interesting lines of research he had

815
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,390
run across in investigating mathematically
the trick of turning electric to magnetic

816
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,500
fields and then turning them back again.

817
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,749
It might be that along this line he would
find the answer to the speed greater than

818
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:02,749
that of light.

819
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:06,359
At any rate, he was interested.

820
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:10,680
He worked the rest of that day, and most of
the next on that line—till he ran it into

821
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:19,259
the ground with a pair of equations that ended
with the expression: dx.dv=h/(4πm).

822
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:24,989
Then Kendall looked at them for a long moment,
then he sighed gently and threw them into

823
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,739
a file cabinet.

824
00:56:26,739 --> 00:56:28,700
Heisenberg's Uncertainty.

825
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:34,109
He'd reduced the thing to a form that simply
told him it was beyond the limits of certainty

826
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:40,969
and he ran it into the normal, natural uncertainty
inevitable in Nature.

827
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,400
Anyway he had real work to do now.

828
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,109
The machine was about ready for his attention.

829
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:50,440
The mechanicians had finished putting it in
shape for demonstration and trial.

830
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,089
He himself would have to test it over the
rest of the afternoon and arrange for power

831
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:55,410
and so forth.

832
00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:00,690
By evening, when Commander McLaurin called
around with some of the other investors in

833
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,970
Kendall's "bank" on Luna, the thing was already
started, warming up.

834
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,450
The fields were being fed and the various
scientists of the group were watching with

835
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,130
interest.

836
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:15,329
Power was flowing in already at a rate of
nearly one hundred thousand horsepower per

837
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:20,369
minute, thanks to a special line given them
by New York Power (a Kendall property).

838
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:25,249
At ten o'clock they were beginning to expect
the reaction to start.

839
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:30,430
By this time the fields weren't gaining in
intensity very rapidly, a maximum intensity

840
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:34,229
had been reached that should, they felt, break
the atoms soon.

841
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:39,880
At eleven-thirty, through the little view
window, Buck Kendall saw something that made

842
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,470
him cry out in amazement.

843
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:48,170
The mercury metal in the receiver, behind
its layers of screening was beginning to glow,

844
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:53,619
with a dull reddish light, and little solidifications
were appearing in it!

845
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:59,219
Eagerly the men looked, as the solidifications
spread slowly, like crystals growing in an

846
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:00,980
evaporating solution.

847
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:06,410
Twelve o'clock came and went, and one o'clock
and two o'clock.

848
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:10,150
Still the slow crystallization went on.

849
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:14,009
Buck Kendall was casting furtive glances at
the kilowatt-hour meter.

850
00:58:14,009 --> 00:58:21,089
It stood at a figure that represented twenty-seven
thousand dollars' worth of power.

851
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:25,690
Long since the power rate had been increased
to the maximum available, as the power plant's

852
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,069
normal load reduced as the morning hours came.

853
00:58:29,069 --> 00:58:34,920
Surely, this time something would start, but
Buck had two worries.

854
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,450
If all the enormous amount of energy they
had poured in there decided to release itself

855
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,450
at once—

856
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:46,319
And at any rate, Buck saw they'd never dare
to let a generator stop, once it was started!

857
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,509
The men were a tense group around the machine
at three-fifteen a.m.

858
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:56,829
There remained only a tiny, dancing globule
of silvery mercury skittering around on the

859
00:58:56,829 --> 00:59:01,380
sharp, needle-like crystals of the dull red
metal that had resulted.

860
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,569
Slowly that skittering drop was shrinking—

861
00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:09,950
Three twenty-two and a half a.m. saw the last
fraction of it vanish.

862
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:16,319
Tensely the men stared into the machine—backing
off slowly—watching the meters on the board.

863
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,430
At nearly eighty thousand volts the power
had been fed into it.

864
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:26,950
The power continued to flow, and a growing
halo of intense violet light appeared suddenly

865
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:31,650
on those red, needle-like crystals, a swiftly
expanding halo—

866
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:39,790
Without a sound, without the slightest disturbance,
the halo vanished, and softly, gently, the

867
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:45,869
needle-like crystals relapsed, melted away,
and a dull pool of metallic mercury rested

868
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:47,420
in the receiver.

869
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:51,970
At eighty thousand volts, power was flowing
in—

870
00:59:51,970 --> 01:00:02,650
And it didn't even sparkle.

871
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:17,000
V
The apparatus of the magnetic shield had been

872
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,599
completed two days later, and set up in Buck's
own laboratory.

873
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:26,130
On the bench was the powerful, but small,
little projector of the straight magnetic

874
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:31,719
field, simply a specially designed accumulator,
a super-condenser, and the peculiar apparatus

875
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,710
Devin had designed to distort the electric
field through ninety degrees to a magnetic

876
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,720
field.

877
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:43,470
Behind this was a curious, paraboloid projector
made up of hundreds of tiny, carefully orientated

878
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,470
coils.

879
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,440
This was Buck's own contribution.

880
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,770
They were ready for the tests.

881
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:55,890
"I would invite McLaurin in to see this,"
said Kendall looking at them, and then across

882
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:01,390
the room bitterly toward the alleged atomic
power apparatus on the opposite bench.

883
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,479
"I think it will work.

884
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:09,309
But after that—" He stared, glaring, at
the heavy tungsten dome with its heavy tungsten

885
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:14,760
contacts, across which the flame of released
atomic energy was supposed to have leapt.

886
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,880
"That was probably the flattest flop any experiment
ever flopped."

887
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,930
"Well—it didn't blow up.

888
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,489
That's one comfort," suggested Devin.

889
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,329
"I wish it had.

890
01:01:27,329 --> 01:01:31,029
Then at least it would have shown some response.

891
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:34,719
The only response shown, actually, was shown
on the power meter.

892
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,640
It damn near wore out the bearings turning
so fast."

893
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,450
"Personally, I prefer the lack of action."

894
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,450
Devin laughed.

895
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,119
"Have you got that circuit hooked up?"

896
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,650
"Right," sighed Kendall, turning back to the
work in hand.

897
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,730
"Is Douglass in on this?"

898
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:52,759
"Yes—in the next room.

899
01:01:52,759 --> 01:01:54,599
He'll let us know when he's ready.

900
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:55,859
He's setting up those instruments."

901
01:01:55,859 --> 01:02:02,299
Douglass, a young junior physicist, late of
the IP Physics Department, stuck his head

902
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:04,930
in the door and announced his instruments
were all set up.

903
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,680
"Keep an eye on them.

904
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,859
They'll move somehow, at any rate.

905
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:13,380
This thing couldn't go as flat as that atom-buster
of mine."

906
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:18,989
Carefully Kendall made a few last-minute adjustments
on the limiting relays, and took up his position

907
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,410
at the power board.

908
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:25,579
Devin took his place near the apparatus, with
another series of instruments, similar to

909
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:29,749
those Douglass was now watching in the next
room, some thirty feet away, through the two-inch

910
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,020
metal wall.

911
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,540
"Ready," called Kendall.

912
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,900
The switch shot home.

913
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,979
Instantly Kendall, Devin, and all the men
in the building jumped some six feet from

914
01:02:40,979 --> 01:02:42,660
their former positions.

915
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:49,079
A monstrous roar of sound crashed out in that
laboratory that thundered from one wall to

916
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:52,420
the other, and bellowed in a Titan's fury.

917
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:57,680
It thundered and growled, it bellowed and
howled, the walls shook with the march and

918
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,210
counter-march of crashing waves of sound.

919
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:06,970
And a ten-foot wavering flame of blue-white,
bellying electric fire shuddered up to the

920
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:11,609
ceiling from the contact points of the alleged
atomic generator.

921
01:03:11,609 --> 01:03:17,239
The heat, pouring out from the flashing, roaring
arc sent prickles of aching burns over Kendall's

922
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:18,239
skin.

923
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:24,790
For ten seconds he stood in utter, paralyzed
surprise as his flop of flops bellowed its

924
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,559
anger at his disdain.

925
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,269
Then he leapt to the power board and shut
off the roaring thing, by cutting the switch

926
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:33,019
that had started it.

927
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:35,809
"Spirits of Space!

928
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:37,930
Did that come to life!"

929
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,589
"Atomic Energy!"

930
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:41,250
Devin cried.

931
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,739
"Atomic energy, hell.

932
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:48,319
That's my thirty thousand dollars' worth of
power breaking loose again," chortled Kendall.

933
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:55,089
"We missed the atomic energy, but, sweet boy,
what an accumulator we stubbed our toes on!

934
01:03:55,089 --> 01:03:59,400
I wondered where in blazes all that power
went to.

935
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,609
That's the answer.

936
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:03,519
I'll bet I can tell you right now what happened.

937
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:10,390
We built that mercury up to a new level, and
that transitional stage was the red, crystalline

938
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:11,460
metal.

939
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,549
When it reached the higher stage, it was temporarily
stable—but that projector over there that

940
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:21,470
we designed for the purpose of holding open
electric and magnetic fields just opened the

941
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:25,200
door and let all that power right out again."

942
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,489
"But why isn't it atomic energy?

943
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:32,059
How do you know that no more than your power
that you put in is coming out?"

944
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:33,180
demanded Devin.

945
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,569
"The arc, man, the arc.

946
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:38,910
That was a high-current, and low-voltage arc.

947
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:44,569
Couldn't you tell by the sound that no great
voltage—as atomic voltages go—was smashing

948
01:04:44,569 --> 01:04:45,829
across there?

949
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:51,400
If we were getting atomic voltage—and power—there'd
have been a different tone to it, high and

950
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,500
shriller.

951
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,630
"Now, did you take any readings?"

952
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,700
"What do you think, man?

953
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,819
I'm human.

954
01:04:57,819 --> 01:05:02,049
Do you think I got any readings with that
thing bellowing and shrieking in my ears,

955
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:04,819
and burning my skin with ultra-violet?

956
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:06,150
It itches now."

957
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,869
Kendall laughed.

958
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:10,619
"You know what to do for an itch.

959
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:13,410
Now, I'm going to make a bet.

960
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:19,309
We had those points separated for a half-million
volts discharge, but there was a dust-cover

961
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:21,390
thrown over them just now.

962
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,900
That, you notice, is missing.

963
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,299
I'll bet that served as a starter lead for
the main arc.

964
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:32,499
Now I'm going to start that projector thing
again, and move the points there through about

965
01:05:32,499 --> 01:05:38,210
six inches, and that thing probably won't
start itself."

966
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:42,130
Most of the laboratory staff had collected
at the doorway, looking in at the white-hot

967
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:47,460
tungsten discharge points, and the now silent
"atomic engine."

968
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,630
Kendall turned to them and said: "The flop
picked itself up.

969
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,140
You go on back, we seem to be all in one piece
yet.

970
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,170
Douglass, you didn't get any readings, did
you?"

971
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,749
Sheepishly, Douglass grinned at him.

972
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,819
"Eh—er—no—but I tore my pants.

973
01:06:04,819 --> 01:06:07,180
The magnetic field grabbed me and I jumped.

974
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:12,589
They had some steel buttons, and a lot of
steel keys—they're kinda' hard to keep on

975
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:13,989
now."

976
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:19,220
The laboratory staff broke into a roar of
laughter, as Douglass, holding up his trousers

977
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,380
with both hands was beheld.

978
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:25,029
"I guess the field worked," he said.

979
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:29,109
"I guess maybe it did," adjudged Kendall solemnly.

980
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:32,589
"We have some rope here if you need it—"

981
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,839
Douglass returned to his post.

982
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:41,349
Swiftly, Kendall altered the atomic distortion
storage apparatus, and returned to the power-board.

983
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:42,849
"Ready?"

984
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:44,349
"Check."

985
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:46,470
Kendall shoved home the switch.

986
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,599
The storage device was silent.

987
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,989
Only a slight feeling of strain made itself
felt, and the sudden noisy hum of a small

988
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:56,759
transformer nearby.

989
01:06:56,759 --> 01:06:58,999
"She works, Buck!"

990
01:06:58,999 --> 01:06:59,999
Devin called.

991
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,489
"The readings check almost exactly."

992
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:04,609
"All good then.

993
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:07,459
Now I want to get to that atomic thing.

994
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:11,190
We can let that slide for a little bit—I'll
answer it."

995
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,770
The telephone had rung noisily.

996
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:16,240
"Kendall Labs—Kendall speaking."

997
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:21,729
"This is Superintendent Foster, of the New
York Power, Mr. Kendall.

998
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:26,510
We have some trouble just now that we think
your operations may be responsible for.

999
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:31,579
The sub-station at North Beaumont blew all
the fuses, and threw the breakers at the main

1000
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:32,579
station.

1001
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:35,529
The men out there said the transformers began
howling—"

1002
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:39,010
"Right you are—I'm afraid I did do that.

1003
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,049
I had no idea that it would reach so far.

1004
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:44,530
How far is that from my place here?"

1005
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:48,390
"It's about a thousand yards, according to
the survey maps."

1006
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:51,609
"Thanks—and I'll be careful about it.

1007
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,790
Any damage, I am responsible for?

1008
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:54,790
All okay?"

1009
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:56,849
"Yes, sir, Mr. Kendall."

1010
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:59,319
Kendall hung up.

1011
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:03,029
"We stirred up a lot more dust than we expected,
Devin.

1012
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:05,829
Now let's start seeing if we can keep track
of it.

1013
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:08,180
Douglass, how did your readings show?"

1014
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:11,059
"I took them at the ten stations, and here
they are.

1015
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,539
The stations are two feet apart."

1016
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:17,140
"H-m-m—.5—.55—.6—.7—20—198—5950—6010—6012—5920.

1017
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:33,609
Very, very nice—only the darned thing's
got an arm as long as the law.

1018
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,390
Your readings were about .2, Devin?"

1019
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,920
"That's right."

1020
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,940
"Then these little readings are just leakage.

1021
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,060
What's our normal intensity here?"

1022
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,180
"About .19.

1023
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:48,920
Just a very small fraction less than the readings."

1024
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:55,420
"Perfect—we have what amounts to a hollow
shell of magnetic force—we can move inside,

1025
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,500
and you can move outside—far enough.

1026
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,549
But you can't get a conductor or a magnetic
field through it."

1027
01:09:01,549 --> 01:09:05,119
He put the readings on the bench, and looked
at the apparatus across the room.

1028
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,869
"Now I want to start right on that other.

1029
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:14,009
Douglass, you move that magnetostat apparatus
out of the way, and leave just the 'can-opener'

1030
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:16,210
of ours—the projector.

1031
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,940
I'm pretty sure that's what does the deed.

1032
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:23,829
Devin, see if you can hunt up some electrostatic
voltmeters with a range in the neighborhood

1033
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:27,510
of—I think it'll be about eighty thousand."

1034
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:33,089
Rapidly, Douglass was dismounting the apparatus,
as Devin started for the stock room.

1035
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:37,880
Kendall started making some new connections,
reconnecting the apparatus they had intended

1036
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,469
using on the "atomic engine," largely high-capacity
resistances.

1037
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:49,620
He seemed to perform this work mechanically,
his mind definitely on something else.

1038
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:54,170
Suddenly he stopped, and looked carefully
into the receiver of the machine.

1039
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:59,970
The metal in it was silvery, liquid, and here
and there a floating crystal of the dull red

1040
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,050
metal.

1041
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,739
Slowly a smile spread across his face.

1042
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,699
He turned to Douglass.

1043
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:09,010
"Douglass—ah, you're through.

1044
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:13,340
Get on the trail of MacBride, and get him
and his crew to work making half a dozen smaller

1045
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,280
things like this.

1046
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,469
Tell 'em they can leave off the tungsten shield.

1047
01:10:17,469 --> 01:10:21,040
I want different metals in the receiver of
each.

1048
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,390
Use—hmmm—sodium—copper—magnesium—aluminium,
iron and chromium.

1049
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,449
Got it?"

1050
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:29,430
"Yes, sir."

1051
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:33,420
He left, just as Devin returned with a large
electrostatic voltmeter.

1052
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:42,719
"I'd like," said he, "to know how you know
the voltage will range around eighty thousand."

1053
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,070
"K-ring excitation potential for mercury.

1054
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:50,450
I'm willing to bet that thing simply shoved
the whole electron system of the mercury out

1055
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:55,030
a notch—that it simply hasn't any K-ring
of electrons now.

1056
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:57,010
I'm trying some other metals.

1057
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:01,100
Douglass is going to have MacBride make up
half a dozen more machines.

1058
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,080
Machines—they need a name.

1059
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,070
This—ah—this is an 'atostor.'

1060
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:11,969
MacBride's going to make up half a dozen of
'em, and try half a dozen metals.

1061
01:11:11,969 --> 01:11:16,110
I'm almost certain that's not mercury in there
now, at all.

1062
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,389
It's probably element 99 or something like
it."

1063
01:11:19,389 --> 01:11:21,810
"It looks like mercury—"

1064
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,810
"Certainly.

1065
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:25,650
So would 99.

1066
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:30,880
Following the periodic table, 99 would probably
have an even lower melting point than mercury,

1067
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,030
be silvery, dense and heavy—and perhaps
slightly radioactive.

1068
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:41,920
The series under the B family of Group II
is Magnesium, Zinc, Cadmium, Mercury—and

1069
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,920
99.

1070
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,260
The melting point is going down all the way,
and they're all silvery metals.

1071
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:54,320
I'm going to try copper, and I fully expect
it to turn silvery—in fact, to become silver."

1072
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,840
"Then let's see."

1073
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,199
Swiftly they hooked up the apparatus, realigned
the projector, and again Kendall took his

1074
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,280
place at the power-board.

1075
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:09,349
As he closed the switch, on no-load, the electrostatic
voltmeter flopped over instantly, and steadied

1076
01:12:09,349 --> 01:12:12,219
at just over 80,000 volts.

1077
01:12:12,219 --> 01:12:16,060
"I hate to say 'I told you so,'" said Kendall.

1078
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,170
"But let's hook in a load.

1079
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:21,590
Try it on about 100 amps first."

1080
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,670
Devin began cutting in load.

1081
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:28,900
The resistors began heating up swiftly as
more and more current flowed through them.

1082
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:35,670
By not so much as by a vibration of the voltmeter
needle, did the apparatus betray any strain

1083
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,780
as the load mounted swiftly.

1084
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:42,060
100—200—500—1000 amperes.

1085
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,440
Still, that needle held steady.

1086
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:50,780
Finally, with a drain of ten thousand amperes,
all the equipment available could handle,

1087
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:56,170
the needle was steady as a rock, though the
tremendous load of 800,000,000 watts was cut

1088
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:57,670
in and out.

1089
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:05,030
That, to atoms, atoms by the nonillions, was
no appreciable load at all.

1090
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:09,060
There was no internal resistance whatever.

1091
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,869
The perfect accumulator had certainly been
discovered.

1092
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:20,540
"I'll have to call McLaurin—" Kendall hurried
away with a broad, broad smile.

1093
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:31,360
VI
"Hello, Tom?"

1094
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:42,349
The 
telephone rattled in a peeved sort of way.

1095
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:44,130
"Yes, it is.

1096
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,329
What now?

1097
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:48,650
And when am I going to see you in a social
sort of way again?"

1098
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:52,250
"Not for a long, long time; I'm busy.

1099
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,230
I'm busy right now as a matter of fact.

1100
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:58,909
I'm calling up the vice-president of Faragaut
Interplanetary Lines, and I want to place

1101
01:13:58,909 --> 01:13:59,909
an order."

1102
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:01,949
"Why bother me?

1103
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:07,060
We have clerks, you know, for that sort of
thing," suggested Faragaut in a pained voice.

1104
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,520
"Tom, do you know how much I'm worth now?"

1105
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,650
"Not much," replied Faragaut promptly.

1106
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:14,940
"What of it?

1107
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,440
I hear, as a matter of fact that you're worth
even less in a business way.

1108
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:23,090
They're talking quite a lot down this way
about an alleged bank you're setting up on

1109
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,090
Luna.

1110
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:29,690
I hear it's got more protective devices, and
armor than any IP station in the System, that

1111
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:35,030
you even had it designed by an IP designer,
and have a gang of Colonels and Generals in

1112
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:36,030
charge.

1113
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:39,989
I also hear that you've succeeded in getting
rid of money at about one million dollars

1114
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:43,099
a day—just slightly shy of that."

1115
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:45,679
"You overestimate me, my friend.

1116
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,250
Much of that is merely contracted for.

1117
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,929
Actually it'll take me nearly nine months
to get rid of it.

1118
01:14:51,929 --> 01:14:54,150
And by that time I'll have more.

1119
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,520
Anyway, I think I have something like ten
million left.

1120
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,340
And remember that way back in the twentieth
century some old fellow beat my record.

1121
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:09,000
Armour, I think it was, lost a million dollars
a day for a couple of months running.

1122
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,989
"Anyway, what I called you up for was to say
I'd like to order five hundred thousand tons

1123
01:15:14,989 --> 01:15:18,110
of mercury, for delivery as soon as possible."

1124
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,110
"What!

1125
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:22,670
Oh, say, I thought you were going in for business."

1126
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:25,650
Faragaut gave a slight laugh of relief.

1127
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:27,750
"Tom, I am.

1128
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:30,170
I mean exactly what I say.

1129
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:37,350
I want five—hundred—thousand—tons of
metallic mercury, and just as soon as you

1130
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:38,820
can get it."

1131
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:42,179
"Man, there isn't that much in the system."

1132
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:43,630
"I know it.

1133
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:48,489
Get all there is on the market for me, and
contract to take all the 'Jupiter Heavy-Metals'

1134
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:50,219
can turn out.

1135
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:54,590
You send those orders through, and clean out
the market completely.

1136
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:58,151
Somebody's about to pay for the work I've
been doing, and boy, they're going to pay

1137
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:00,239
through the nose.

1138
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:04,300
After you've got that order launched, and
don't make a christening party of the launching

1139
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:09,909
either, why just drop out here, and I'll show
you why the value of mercury is going so high

1140
01:16:09,909 --> 01:16:14,030
you won't be able to follow it in a space
ship."

1141
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:20,321
"The cost of that," said Faragaut, seriously
now, "will be about—fifty-three million

1142
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:21,610
at the market price.

1143
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,829
You'd have to put up twenty-six cash, and
I don't believe you've got it."

1144
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:27,070
Buck laughed.

1145
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:30,920
"Tom, loan me a dozen million, will you?

1146
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,040
You send that order through, and then come
see what I've got.

1147
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,570
I've got a break, too!

1148
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:41,159
Mercury's the best metal for this use—and
it'll stop gamma rays too!"

1149
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:46,360
"So it will—but for the love of the system,
what of it?"

1150
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,070
"Come and see—tonight.

1151
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,400
Will you send that order through?"

1152
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,250
"I will, Buck.

1153
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,409
I hope you're right.

1154
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:57,980
Cash is tight now, and I'll probably have
to put up nearer twenty million, when all

1155
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,530
that buying goes through.

1156
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:03,480
How long will it be tied up in that deal,
do you think?"

1157
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,060
"Not over three weeks.

1158
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:10,750
And I'll guarantee you three hundred percent—if
you'll stay in with me after you start.

1159
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,969
Otherwise—I don't think making this money
would be fair just now."

1160
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:18,449
"I'll be out to see you in about two hours,
Buck.

1161
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:19,590
Where are you?

1162
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:21,690
At the estate?" asked Faragaut seriously.

1163
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:24,310
"In my lab out there.

1164
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,150
Thanks, Tom."

1165
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,800
McLaurin was there when Tom Faragaut arrived.

1166
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,000
And General Logan, and Colonel Gerardhi.

1167
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,780
There was a restrained air of gratefulness
about all of them that Tom Faragaut couldn't

1168
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,820
quite understand.

1169
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:44,449
He had been looking up Buck Kendall's famous
bank, and more and more he had begun to wonder

1170
01:17:44,449 --> 01:17:46,780
just what was up.

1171
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:51,219
The list of stockholders had read like a list
of IP heroes and executives.

1172
01:17:51,219 --> 01:17:56,889
The staff had been a list of IP men with a
slender sprinkling of accountants.

1173
01:17:56,889 --> 01:18:03,270
And the sixty-million dollar structure was
to be a bank without advertising of any sort!

1174
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:06,810
Usually such a venture is planned and published
months in advance.

1175
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:12,250
This had sprung up suddenly, with a strange
quietness.

1176
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,500
Almost silently, Buck Kendall led the way
to the laboratory.

1177
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:22,000
A small metal tank was supported in a peculiar
piece of apparatus, and from it led a small

1178
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,409
platinum pipe to a domed apparatus made largely
of insulum.

1179
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:33,560
A little pool of mercury, with small red crystals
floating in it rested in a shallow hollow

1180
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,580
surrounded by heavy conductors.

1181
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,199
"That's it, Tom.

1182
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:42,460
I wanted to show you first what we have, and
why I wanted all that mercury.

1183
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:47,989
Within three weeks, every man, woman and child
in the system will be clamoring for mercury

1184
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,599
metal.

1185
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,820
That's the perfect accumulator."

1186
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:57,320
Quickly he demonstrated the machine, charging
it, and then discharging it.

1187
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:05,560
It was better than 99.95% efficient on the
charge, and was 100% efficient on the discharge.

1188
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,579
"Physically, any metal will do.

1189
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:11,260
Technically, mercury is best for a number
of reasons.

1190
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,780
It's a liquid.

1191
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:18,219
I can, and do it in this, charge a certain
quantity, and then move it up to the storage

1192
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:19,219
tank.

1193
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:21,159
Charge another pool, and move it up.

1194
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:27,650
In discharge, I can let a stream flow in continuously
if I required a steady, terrific drain of

1195
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:29,540
power without interruption.

1196
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:36,050
If I wanted it for more normal service, I'd
discharge a pool, drain it, refill the receiver,

1197
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,280
and discharge a second pool.

1198
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,040
Thus, mercury is the metal to use.

1199
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,270
"Do you see why I wanted all that metal?"

1200
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:49,030
"I do, Buck—Lord, I do," gasped Faragaut.

1201
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:51,810
"That is the perfect power supply."

1202
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,380
"No, confound it, it isn't.

1203
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,550
It's a secondary source.

1204
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,949
It isn't primary.

1205
01:19:57,949 --> 01:20:03,829
We're just as limited in the supply of power
as ever—only we have increased our distribution

1206
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:04,829
of power.

1207
01:20:04,829 --> 01:20:10,829
Lord knows, we're going to need a power supply
badly enough before long—" Buck relapsed

1208
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:12,560
into moody silence.

1209
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,250
"What," asked Faragaut, looking around him,
"does that mean?"

1210
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:22,969
It was McLaurin who told him of the stranger
ship, and Kendall's interpretation of its

1211
01:20:22,969 --> 01:20:24,480
meaning.

1212
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:30,270
Slowly Faragaut grasped the meaning behind
Buck's strange actions of the past months.

1213
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:35,270
"The Lunar Bank," he said slowly, half to
himself.

1214
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:39,929
"Staffed by trained IP men, experts in expert
destruction.

1215
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:43,580
Buck, you said something about the profits
of this venture.

1216
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:44,790
What did you mean?"

1217
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,719
Buck smiled.

1218
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:53,040
"We're going to stick up IP to the extent
necessary to pay for that fort—er—bank—on

1219
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,590
Luna.

1220
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:59,440
We'll also boost the price so that we'll make
enough to pay for those ships I'm having made.

1221
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,360
The public will pay for that."

1222
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,090
"I see.

1223
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:06,170
And we aren't to stick the price too high,
and just make money?"

1224
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:08,070
"That's the general idea."

1225
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:13,920
"The IP Appropriations Board won't give you
what you need, Commander, for real improvements

1226
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,620
on the IP ships?"

1227
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,690
"They won't believe Kendall.

1228
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:18,940
Therefore they won't."

1229
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,460
"What did you mean about gamma rays, Buck?"

1230
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:27,340
"Mercury will stop them and the Commander
here intends to have the refitted ships built

1231
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:33,010
so that the engine room and control room are
one, and completely surrounded by the mercury

1232
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,010
tanks.

1233
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:37,030
The men will be protected against the gamma
rays."

1234
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:42,170
"Won't the rays affect the power stored in
the mercury—perhaps release it?"

1235
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:47,909
"We tried it out, of course, and while we
can't get the intensities we expect, and can't

1236
01:21:47,909 --> 01:21:52,480
really make any measurements of the gamma-ray
energy impinging on the mercury—it seems

1237
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,710
to absorb, and store that energy!"

1238
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,790
"What's next on the program, Buck?"

1239
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,659
"Finish those ships I have building.

1240
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:04,239
And I want to do some more development work.

1241
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:08,540
The Stranger will return within six months
now, I believe.

1242
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:13,260
It will take all that time, and more for real
refitting of the IP ships."

1243
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:18,230
"How about more forts—or banks, whichever
you want to call them.

1244
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,650
Mars isn't protected."

1245
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:23,790
"Mars is abandoned," replied General Logan
seriously.

1246
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:28,310
"We haven't any too much to protect old Earth,
and she must come first.

1247
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:33,160
Mars will, of course, be protected as best
the IP ships can.

1248
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,190
But—we're expecting defeat.

1249
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,500
This isn't a case of glorious victory.

1250
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,889
It will be a case of hard won survival.

1251
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:46,530
We don't know anything about the enemy—except
that they are capable of interstellar flights,

1252
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,130
and have atomic energy.

1253
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,480
They are evidently far ahead of us.

1254
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,310
Our battle is to survive till we learn how
to conquer.

1255
01:22:54,310 --> 01:23:00,150
For a time, at least, the Strangers will have
possession of most of the planets of the system.

1256
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:05,409
We do not think they will be able to reach
Earth, because Commander McLaurin here will

1257
01:23:05,409 --> 01:23:10,630
withdraw his ships to Earth to protect the
planet—and the great 'Lunar Bank' will display

1258
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:22,110
its true character."

1259
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:35,650
VII
Faragaut looked unsympathetically at Buck

1260
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:40,430
Kendall, as he stood glaring perplexedly at
the apparatus he had been working on.

1261
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:44,320
"What's the matter, Buck, won't she perk?"

1262
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,239
"No, damn it, and it should."

1263
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,159
"That," pointed out Faragaut, "is just what
you think.

1264
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:52,780
Nature thinks otherwise.

1265
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,280
We generally have to abide by her opinions.

1266
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,490
What is it—or what is it meant to be?"

1267
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:59,960
"Perfect reflector."

1268
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,929
"Make a nice mirror.

1269
01:24:02,929 --> 01:24:05,739
What else, and how come?"

1270
01:24:05,739 --> 01:24:08,969
"A mirror is just what I want.

1271
01:24:08,969 --> 01:24:13,619
I want something that will reflect all the
radiation that falls on it.

1272
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:18,570
No metal will, even in its range of maximum
reflectivity.

1273
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:22,990
Aluminum goes pretty high, silver, on some
ranges, a bit higher.

1274
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:25,829
But none of them reaches 99%.

1275
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:31,630
I want a perfect reflector that I can put
behind a source of wild, radiant energy so

1276
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:35,969
I can focus it, and put it where it will do
the most good."

1277
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:38,489
"Ninety-nine percent.

1278
01:24:38,489 --> 01:24:40,110
Sounds pretty good.

1279
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:43,630
That's better efficiency than most anything
else we have, isn't it?"

1280
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,510
"No, it isn't.

1281
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:52,630
The accumulator is 100% efficient on the discharge,
and a good transformer, even before that,

1282
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:55,240
ran as high as 99.8 sometimes.

1283
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,620
They had to.

1284
01:24:56,620 --> 01:25:03,199
If you have a transformer handling 1,000,000
horsepower, and it's even 1% inefficient,

1285
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:07,630
you have a heat loss of nearly 10,000 horsepower
to handle.

1286
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:13,690
I want to use this as a destructive weapon,
and if I hand the other fellow energy in distressing

1287
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:18,949
amounts, it's even worse at my end, because
no matter how perfect a beam I work out, there

1288
01:25:18,949 --> 01:25:21,449
will still be some spread.

1289
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:25,760
I can make it mighty tight though, if I make
my surface a perfect parabola.

1290
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:32,780
But if I send a million horse, I have to handle
it, and a ship can't stand several hundred

1291
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:38,380
thousand horsepower roaming around loose as
heat, let alone the weapon itself.

1292
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,270
The thing will be worse to me than to him.

1293
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:46,400
"I figured there was something worth investigating
in those fields we developed on our magnetic

1294
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,400
shield work.

1295
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,860
They had to do, you know, with light, and
radiant energy.

1296
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,420
There must be some reason why a metal reflects.

1297
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,940
Further, though we can't get down to the basic
root of matter, the atom, yet, we can play

1298
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:04,880
around just about as we please with molecules
and molecular forces.

1299
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,530
But it is molecular force that determines
whether light and radiant energy of that caliber

1300
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:12,800
shall be reflected or transmitted.

1301
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,460
Take aluminum as an example.

1302
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:19,790
In the metallic molecule state, the metal
will reflect pretty well.

1303
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:23,780
But volatilize it, and it becomes transparent.

1304
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:28,449
All gases are transparent, all metals reflective.

1305
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:33,380
Then the secret of perfect reflection lies
at a molecular level in the organization of

1306
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,510
matter, and is within our reach.

1307
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:40,679
Well—this thing was supposed to make that
piece of silver reflective.

1308
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:43,239
I missed it that time."

1309
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:44,270
He sighed.

1310
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,830
"I suppose I'll have to try again."

1311
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:51,230
"I should think you'd use tungsten for that.

1312
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:54,730
If you do have a slight leak, that would handle
the heat."

1313
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:57,440
"No, it would hold it.

1314
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,180
Silver is a better conductor of heat.

1315
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,760
But the darned thing won't work."

1316
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,159
"Your other scheme has."

1317
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:06,200
Faragaut laughed.

1318
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,730
"I came out principally for some signatures.

1319
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:12,040
IP wants one hundred thousand tons of mercury.

1320
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,199
I've sold most of mine already in the open
market.

1321
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,230
You want to sell?"

1322
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:17,230
"Certainly.

1323
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,770
And I told you my price."

1324
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:22,440
"I know," sighed Faragaut.

1325
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,420
"It seems a shame though.

1326
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:27,400
Those IP board men would pay higher.

1327
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:32,679
And they're so damn tight it seems a crime
not to make 'em pay up when they have to."

1328
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:35,840
"The IP will need the money worse elsewhere.

1329
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,590
Where do I—oh, here?"

1330
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:39,590
"Right.

1331
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:40,660
I'll be out again this evening.

1332
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,989
The regular group will be here?"

1333
01:27:42,989 --> 01:27:45,559
Kendall nodded as he signed in triplicate.

1334
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:51,710
That evening, Buck had found the trouble in
his apparatus, for as he well knew, the theory

1335
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:55,840
was right, only the practical apparatus needed
changing.

1336
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:02,190
Before the group composed of Faragaut, McLaurin
and the members of Kendall's "bank," he demonstrated

1337
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,260
it.

1338
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:09,860
It was merely a small, model apparatus, with
a mirror of space-strained silver that was

1339
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,989
an absolutely perfect reflector.

1340
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:17,880
The mirror had been ground out of a block
of silver one foot deep, by four inches square,

1341
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:23,460
carefully annealed, and the work had all been
done in a cooling bath.

1342
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:29,520
The result was a mirror that was so nearly
a perfect paraboloid that the beam held sharp

1343
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,670
and absolutely tight for the half-mile range
they tested it on.

1344
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,320
At the projector it was three and one-half
inches in diameter.

1345
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:43,070
At the target, it was three and fifty-two
one hundredths inches in diameter.

1346
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:48,610
"Well, you've got the mirror, what are you
going to reflect with it now?" asked McLaurin.

1347
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:52,719
"The greatest problem is getting a radiant
source, isn't it?

1348
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,730
You can't get a temperature above about ten
thousand degrees, and maintain it very long,

1349
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:59,060
can you?"

1350
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,400
"Why not?"

1351
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,400
Kendall smiled.

1352
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,830
"It'll volatilize and leave the scene of action,
won't it?"

1353
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:09,469
"What if it's a gaseous source already?"

1354
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:10,980
"What?

1355
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,139
Just a gas-flame?

1356
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,449
That won't give you the point source you need.

1357
01:29:15,449 --> 01:29:20,140
You're using just a spotlight here, with a
Moregan Point-light.

1358
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:24,550
That won't give you energy, and if you use
a gas-flame, the spread will be so great,

1359
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:28,730
that no matter how perfectly you figure your
mirror, it won't beam."

1360
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,849
"The answer is easy.

1361
01:29:31,849 --> 01:29:38,540
Not an ordinary gas-flame—a very extra-special
kind of gas-flame.

1362
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,159
Know anything about Renwright's ionization-work?"

1363
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:46,210
"Renwright—he's an IP man isn't he?"

1364
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:47,210
"Right.

1365
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:52,159
He's developed a system, which, thanks to
the power we can get in that atostor, will

1366
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:55,110
sextuply ionize oxygen gas.

1367
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:58,190
Now: what does that mean?"

1368
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:01,900
"Spirits of space!

1369
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,159
Concentrated essence of energy!"

1370
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,719
"Right.

1371
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:09,730
And in preparation, Cole here had one made
up for me.

1372
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:11,829
That—and something else.

1373
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:13,199
We'll just hook it up—"

1374
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:19,880
With Devin's aid, Kendall attached the second
apparatus, a larger device into which the

1375
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:23,170
silver block with its mirror surface fitted.

1376
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:27,410
With the uttermost care, the two physicists
lined it up.

1377
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:33,579
Two projectors pointed toward each other at
an angle, the base angles of a triangle, whose

1378
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:36,119
apex was the center of the mirror.

1379
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:40,800
On very low power, a soft, glowing violet
light filtered out through the opening of

1380
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,230
the one, and a slight green light came from
the other.

1381
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:49,780
But where the two streams met, an intense,
violet glare built up.

1382
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:56,090
The center of action was not at the focus,
and slowly this was lined up, till a sharp,

1383
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:00,980
violet beam of light reached out across the
open yard to the target set up.

1384
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:05,520
Buck Kendall cut off the power, and slowly
got into position.

1385
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,520
"Now.

1386
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,030
Keep out from in front of that thing.

1387
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:11,400
Put on these glasses—and watch out."

1388
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:17,430
Heavy, thick-lensed orange-brown goggles were
passed out, and Kendall took his place.

1389
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:23,860
Before him, a thick window of the same glass
had been arranged, so that he might see uninterruptedly

1390
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:28,949
the controls at hand, and yet watch unblinded,
the action of the beam.

1391
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:33,060
Dully the mirror-force relay clicked.

1392
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:36,540
A hazy glow ran over the silver block, and
died.

1393
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:43,880
Then—simultaneously the power was thrown
from two small, compact atostors into the

1394
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,790
twin projectors.

1395
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:52,849
Instantly—a titanic eruption of light almost
invisibly violet, spurted out in a solid,

1396
01:31:52,849 --> 01:31:54,150
compact stream.

1397
01:31:54,150 --> 01:32:00,159
With a roar and crash, it battered its way
through the thick air, and crashed into the

1398
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:01,820
heavy target plate.

1399
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:07,389
A stream of flame and scintillating sparks
erupted from the armor plate—and died as

1400
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:09,639
Kendall cut the beam.

1401
01:32:09,639 --> 01:32:14,860
A white-hot area a foot across leaked down
the face of the metal.

1402
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:18,860
"That," said Faragaut gently, removing his
goggles.

1403
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,540
"That's not a spotlight, and it's not exactly
a gas-flame.

1404
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:26,810
But I still don't know what that blue-hot
needle of destruction is.

1405
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:30,949
Just what do you call that tame stellar furnace
of yours?"

1406
01:32:30,949 --> 01:32:37,120
"Not so far off, Tom," said Kendall happily,
"except that even S Doradus is cold compared

1407
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,620
to that.

1408
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:45,640
That sends almost pure ultra-violet light—which,
by the way, it is almost impossible to reflect

1409
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:50,349
successfully, and represents a temperature
to be expressed not in thousands of degrees,

1410
01:32:50,349 --> 01:32:52,770
nor yet in tens of thousands.

1411
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:57,790
I calculated the temperature would be about
750,000 degrees.

1412
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:04,960
What is happening is that a stream of low-voltage
electrons—cathode rays—in great quantity

1413
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,520
are meeting great quantities of sextuply ionized
oxygen.

1414
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:16,560
That means that a nucleus used to having two
electrons in the K-ring, and six in the next,

1415
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:22,780
has had that outer six knocked off, and then
has been hurled violently into free air.

1416
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:30,100
"All by themselves, those sextuply ionized
oxygen atoms would have a good bit to say,

1417
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:35,210
but they don't really begin to talk till they
start roaring for those electrons I'm feeding

1418
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:36,400
them.

1419
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:41,829
At the meeting point, they grab up all they
can get—probably about five—before the

1420
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:46,670
competition and the fierce release of energy
drives them out, part-satisfied.

1421
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:50,930
I lose a little energy there, but not a real
fraction.

1422
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:55,660
It's the howl they put up for the first four
that counts.

1423
01:33:55,660 --> 01:34:01,739
The electron-feed is necessary, because otherwise
they'd smash on and ruin that mirror.

1424
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:04,790
They work practically in a perfect vacuum.

1425
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:07,590
That beam smashes the air out of the way.

1426
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:10,809
Of course, in space it would work better."

1427
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:14,460
"How could it?" asked Faragaut, faintly.

1428
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:20,119
"Kendall," asked McLaurin, "can we install
that in the IP ships?"

1429
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:21,790
"You can start."

1430
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,790
Kendall shrugged.

1431
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,110
"There isn't a lot of apparatus.

1432
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:27,889
I'm going to install them in my ships, and
in the—bank.

1433
01:34:27,889 --> 01:34:31,190
I suspect—we haven't a lot of time left."

1434
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:34,139
"How near ready are those ships?"

1435
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:35,389
"About.

1436
01:34:35,389 --> 01:34:36,489
That's all I can say.

1437
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:40,179
They've been torn up a bit for installation
of the atostor apparatus.

1438
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:42,220
Now they'll have to be changed again."

1439
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:45,329
"Anything more coming?"

1440
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:47,929
Buck smiled slowly.

1441
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:53,540
He turned directly to McLaurin and replied:
"Yes—the Strangers.

1442
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:57,050
As to developments—I can't tell, naturally.

1443
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:01,550
But if they do, it will be something entirely
unexpected now.

1444
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:07,460
You see, given one new discovery, a half-dozen
will follow immediately from it.

1445
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,990
When we announced that atostor, look what
happened.

1446
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:15,489
Renwright must have thought it was God's gift
to suffering physicists.

1447
01:35:15,489 --> 01:35:18,870
He stuck some oxygen in the thing, added some
of his own stuff—and behold.

1448
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:24,949
The magnetic apparatus gave us directly the
shield, and indirectly this mirror.

1449
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:28,620
Now, I seem to have reached the end for the
time.

1450
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:33,460
I'm still trying to get that space-release
for high speed—speed greater than light,

1451
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,460
that is.

1452
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:40,820
So far," he added bitterly, "all I've gotten
as an answer is a single expression that simply

1453
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:44,820
means practical zero—Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Expression."

1454
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:51,289
"I'm uncertain as to your meaning"—McLaurin
smiled—"but I take it that's nothing new."

1455
01:35:51,289 --> 01:35:52,289
"No.

1456
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:56,280
Nearly four centuries old—twentieth century
physics.

1457
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:02,739
I'll have to try some other line of attack,
I guess, but that did seem so darned right.

1458
01:36:02,739 --> 01:36:04,370
It just sounded right.

1459
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:10,059
Something ought to happen—and it just keeps
saying 'nothing more except the natural uncertainty

1460
01:36:10,059 --> 01:36:11,059
of nature.'"

1461
01:36:11,059 --> 01:36:15,520
"Try it out, your math might be wrong somewhere."

1462
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,520
Kendall laughed.

1463
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,739
"If it was—I'd hate to try it out.

1464
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:22,280
If it wasn't I'd have no reason to.

1465
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,940
And there's plenty of other work to do.

1466
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:27,270
For one thing, getting that apparatus in production.

1467
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:29,320
The IP board won't like me."

1468
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,320
Kendall smiled.

1469
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,280
"They don't," replied McLaurin.

1470
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,630
"They're getting more and more and more worried—but
they've got to keep the IP fleet in such condition

1471
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:44,210
that it can at least catch an up-to-date freighter."

1472
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:52,349
Gresth Gkae looked back at Sthor rapidly dropping
behind, and across at her sister world, Asthor,

1473
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:55,369
circling a bare 100,000 miles away.

1474
01:36:55,369 --> 01:37:01,840
Behind his great interstellar cruiser came
a long line of similar ships.

1475
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,820
Each was loaded now not with instruments and
pure scientists, but with weapons, fuel and

1476
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,820
warriors.

1477
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:11,909
Colonists too, came in the last ships.

1478
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:15,080
One hundred and fifty giant ships.

1479
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:21,720
All the wealth of Sthor and Asthor had been
concentrated in producing those great machines.

1480
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,770
Every one represented nearly the equivalent
of thirty million Earth-dollars.

1481
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:31,000
Four and a half billions of dollars for mere
materials.

1482
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,130
Gresth Gkae had the honor of lead position,
for he had discovered the planets and their

1483
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:38,460
stable, though tiny, sun.

1484
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:45,360
Still, Gresth Gkae knew his own giant Mira
was a super-giant sun—and a curse and a

1485
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,180
menace to any rational society.

1486
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:54,610
Our yellow-white sun (to his eyes, an almost
invisible color, similar to our blue) was

1487
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:57,890
small, but stable, and warm enough.

1488
01:37:57,890 --> 01:38:04,620
In half an hour, all the ships were in space,
and at a given signal, at ten-second intervals,

1489
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,929
they sprang into the superspeed, faster than
light.

1490
01:38:08,929 --> 01:38:14,809
For an instant, giant Mira ran and seemed
distorted, as though seen through a porthole

1491
01:38:14,809 --> 01:38:19,950
covered with running water, then steadied,
curiously distorted.

1492
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:25,020
Faster than light they raced across the galaxy.

1493
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:29,840
Even in their super-fast ships, nearly three
and a half weeks passed before the sun they

1494
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,390
sought, singled itself from the star-field
as an extra bright point.

1495
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:38,929
Two days more, and the sun was within planetary
distance.

1496
01:38:38,929 --> 01:38:44,630
They came at an angle to the plane of the
ecliptic, but they leveled down to it now,

1497
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:48,469
and slanted toward giant Jupiter and Jovian
worlds.

1498
01:38:48,469 --> 01:38:54,670
Ten worlds, in one sweep, it was—four habitable
worlds.

1499
01:38:54,670 --> 01:39:00,860
The nine satellites would be converted into
forts at once, nine space-sweeping forts guarding

1500
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:03,039
the approaches to the planet.

1501
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:08,559
Gresth Gkae had made a fairly good search
of the worlds, and knew that Earth was the

1502
01:39:08,559 --> 01:39:11,679
main home of civilization in this system.

1503
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,710
Mars was second, and Venus third.

1504
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:19,239
But Jupiter offered the greatest possibilities
for quick settlement, a base from which they

1505
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:24,960
could more easily operate, a base for fuels,
for the heavy elements they would need—

1506
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:31,039
Fifteen million miles from Jupiter they slowed
below the speed of light—and the IP stations

1507
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:32,599
observed them.

1508
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:38,889
Instantly, according to instructions issued
by Commander McLaurin, a fleet of ten of the

1509
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:41,870
tiniest, fastest scouts darted out.

1510
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:47,050
As soon as possible, a group of three heavy
cruisers, armed with all the inventions that

1511
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:53,489
had been discovered, the atostor power system,
perfectly conducting power leads, the terrible

1512
01:39:53,489 --> 01:39:56,050
UV ray, started out.

1513
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:58,320
The scouts got there first.

1514
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:03,619
Cameras were grinding steadily, with long
range telescopic lenses, delicate instruments

1515
01:40:03,619 --> 01:40:07,989
probed and felt and caught their fingers in
the fields of the giant fleet.

1516
01:40:07,989 --> 01:40:15,810
At ten-second intervals, giant ships popped
into being, and glided smoothly toward Jupiter.

1517
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,780
Then the cruisers arrived.

1518
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:22,690
They halted at a respectful distance, and
waited.

1519
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:26,099
The Miran ships plowed on undisturbed.

1520
01:40:26,099 --> 01:40:31,030
Simultaneously, from the three leaders, terrific
neutron rays shot out.

1521
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:36,909
The paraffin block walls stopped those—and
the cruisers started to explain their feelings

1522
01:40:36,909 --> 01:40:37,980
on the subject.

1523
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:42,900
They were the IP-J-37, 39, and 42.

1524
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:47,710
The 37 turned up the full power of the UV
ray.

1525
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:53,909
The terrific beam of ultra-violet energy struck
the second Miran ship, and the spot it touched

1526
01:40:53,909 --> 01:41:00,239
exploded into incandescence, burned white-hot—and
puffed out abruptly as the air pressure within

1527
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:03,340
blew the molten metal away.

1528
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,840
The Mirans were startled.

1529
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,700
This was not the type of thing Gresth Gkae
had warned them of.

1530
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:14,810
Gresth Gkae himself frowned as the sudden
roar of the machines of his ship rose in the

1531
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:15,970
metal walls.

1532
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:22,079
A stream of ten-inch atomic bombs shrieked
out of their tubes, fully glowing green things

1533
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:26,400
floated out more slowly, and immediately waxed
brilliant.

1534
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,440
Gamma ray bombs—but they could be guarded
against—

1535
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:37,020
The three Solarian cruisers were washed in
such frightful flame as they had never imagined.

1536
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:43,099
Streams of atomic bombs were exploding soundlessly,
ineffectively in space, not thirty feet from

1537
01:41:43,099 --> 01:41:47,030
them as they felt the sudden resistance of
the magnetic shields.

1538
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:50,730
Hopefully, the 39 probed with her neutron
gun.

1539
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:56,070
Nothing happened save that several gamma ray
bombs went off explosively, and all the atomic

1540
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:59,270
bombs in its path exploded at once.

1541
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:02,730
Gresth Gkae knew what that meant.

1542
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:04,199
Neutron beam guns.

1543
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:08,230
Then this race was more intelligent than he
had believed.

1544
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,619
They had not had them before.

1545
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:15,860
Had he perhaps given them too much warning
and information?

1546
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:20,059
There was a sudden, deeper note in the thrumming
roar of the great ship.

1547
01:42:20,059 --> 01:42:24,850
Eagerly Gresth Gkae watched—and sighed in
relief.

1548
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:28,489
The nearer of the three enemy ships was crumbling
to dust.

1549
01:42:28,489 --> 01:42:32,789
Now the other two were beginning to become
blurred of outline.

1550
01:42:32,789 --> 01:42:36,170
They were fleeing—but oh, so slowly.

1551
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:41,199
Easily the greater ship chased them down,
till only floating dust, and a few small pieces

1552
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:42,199
of—

1553
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:45,869
Gresth Gkae shrieked in pain, and horror.

1554
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:49,309
The destroyed ships had fought in dying.

1555
01:42:49,309 --> 01:42:54,860
All space seemed to blossom out with a terrible
light, a light that wrapped around them, and

1556
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:56,590
burned into him, and through him.

1557
01:42:56,590 --> 01:43:03,320
His eyes were dark and burning lumps in his
head, his flesh seemed crawling, stinging—he

1558
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:08,599
was being flayed alive—in shrieking agony
he crumpled to the floor.

1559
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:13,550
Hospital attachés came to him, and injected
drugs.

1560
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:15,980
Slowly torturing consciousness left him.

1561
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:22,300
The doctors began working over his horribly
burned body, shuddering inwardly as the protective,

1562
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:26,560
feather-like covering of his skin loosened,
and dropped from his body.

1563
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,670
Tenderly they lowered him into a bath of chemicals—

1564
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:37,360
"The terrible light which caused so much damage
to our men," reported a physicist, "was analyzed,

1565
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,850
and found to have some extraordinary lines.

1566
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:46,830
It was largely mercury-vapor spectrum, but
the spectrum of mercury-atoms in an impossibly

1567
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:48,360
strained condition.

1568
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:54,340
I would suggest that great care be used hereafter,
and all men be equipped with protective masks

1569
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:56,469
when observations are needed.

1570
01:43:56,469 --> 01:44:01,570
This sun is very rich in the infra-X-rays
and ultra-visible light.

1571
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:06,699
The explosion of light, we witnessed, was
dangerous in its consisting almost wholly

1572
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:09,630
of very short and hard infra-X-rays."

1573
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:16,699
The physicist had a special term for what
we know as ultra-violet light.

1574
01:44:16,699 --> 01:44:22,340
To him, blue was ultra-violet, and exceedingly
dangerous to red-sensitive eyes.

1575
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:29,219
To him, our ultra-violet was a long X-ray,
and was designated by a special term.

1576
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:35,770
And to him—the explosion of the atostor
reservoirs was a terrible and mystifying calamity.

1577
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:42,880
To the men in the five tiny scout-ships, it
was also a surprise, and a painful one.

1578
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:48,579
Even space-hardened humans were burned by
the terrifically hard ultra-violet from the

1579
01:44:48,579 --> 01:44:49,800
explosion.

1580
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,949
But they got some hint of what it had meant
to the Mirans from the confusion that resulted

1581
01:44:54,949 --> 01:44:56,909
in the fleet.

1582
01:44:56,909 --> 01:45:01,349
Several of the nearer ships spun, twisted,
and went erratically off their courses.

1583
01:45:01,349 --> 01:45:05,139
All seemed uncontrolled momentarily.

1584
01:45:05,139 --> 01:45:09,619
The five scouts, following orders, darted
instantly toward the Lunar Bank.

1585
01:45:09,619 --> 01:45:11,599
Why, they did not know.

1586
01:45:11,599 --> 01:45:12,980
But those were orders.

1587
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,510
They were to land there.

1588
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:20,890
The reason was that, faster than any Solarian
ship, radio signals had reached McLaurin,

1589
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:26,460
and he, and most of the staff of the IP service
had been moved to the Lunar Bank.

1590
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:31,750
Buck Kendall had extended an invitation in
this "unexpected emergency."

1591
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:37,170
It so happened that Buck Kendall's invitation
got there before any description of the Strangers,

1592
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:38,739
or their actions had arrived.

1593
01:45:38,739 --> 01:45:43,889
The staff was somewhat puzzled as to how this
happened—

1594
01:45:43,889 --> 01:45:47,110
And now for the satellites of great Jupiter.

1595
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:51,580
One hundred and fifty giant interstellar cruisers
advanced on Callisto.

1596
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:57,050
They didn't pause to investigate the mines
and scattered farms of the satellite, but

1597
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:03,020
ten great ships settled, and a horde of warriors
began pouring out.

1598
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:06,320
One hundred and forty ships reached Ganymede.

1599
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:09,449
One hundred and thirty sailed on.

1600
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:14,840
One hundred and thirty ships reached Europa—and
they sailed on hurriedly, one hundred and

1601
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,510
twenty-nine of them.

1602
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:21,949
Gresth Gkae did not know it then, but the
fleet had lost its first ship.

1603
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:26,900
The IP station on Europa had spoken back.

1604
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:34,350
They sailed in, a mighty armada, and the first
dropped through Europa's thin, frozen atmosphere.

1605
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:38,910
They spotted the dome of the station, and
a neutron ray lashed out at it.

1606
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:41,880
On the other, undefended worlds, this had
been effective.

1607
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:46,860
Here—it was answered by ten five-foot UV
rays.

1608
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:51,920
Further, these men had learned something from
the destruction of the cruisers, and ten torpedoes

1609
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,920
had been unloaded, reloaded with atostor mercury,
and sent out bravely.

1610
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:01,080
Easily the Mirans wiped out the first torpedo—

1611
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:06,800
Shrieking, the Miran pilots clawed their way
from the controls as the fearful flood of

1612
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,889
ultra-violet light struck their unaccustomed
skins.

1613
01:47:10,889 --> 01:47:13,550
Others too felt that burning flood.

1614
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:19,280
The second torpedo they caught and deflected
on a beam of alternating-current magnetism

1615
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,020
that repelled it.

1616
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:24,389
It did not come nearer than half a mile to
the ship.

1617
01:47:24,389 --> 01:47:31,150
The third they turned their deflecting beam
on—and something went strangely wrong with

1618
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:32,150
the beam.

1619
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:36,520
It pulled that torpedo toward the ship with
a sickening acceleration—and the torpedo

1620
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:40,329
exploded in that frightful violet flame.

1621
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:45,300
Five-foot diameter UV beams are nothing to
play with.

1622
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:50,340
The Mirans were dodging these now as they
loosed atomic bombs, only to see them exploded

1623
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:54,840
harmlessly by neutron guns, or caught in the
magnetic screen.

1624
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,130
Gamma ray bombs were as useless.

1625
01:47:57,130 --> 01:48:02,150
Again the beam of disintegrating force was
turned on—

1626
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:05,170
The present opponent was not a ship.

1627
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:10,530
It was an IP defense station, equipped with
everything Solarian science knew, and the

1628
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,880
dome was an eight-foot wall of tungsten-beryllium.

1629
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:21,330
The eight feet of solid, ultra-resistant alloy
drank up that crumbling beam, and liked it.

1630
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:23,599
The wall did not fail.

1631
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:28,900
The men inside the fort jerked and quivered
as the strange beam, a small, small fraction

1632
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:34,010
of it, penetrated the eight feet of outer
wall, the six feet or so of intervening walls,

1633
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:36,980
and the mercury atostor reserves.

1634
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:41,619
"Concentrate all those UV beams on one spot,
and see if you can blast a hole in him before

1635
01:48:41,619 --> 01:48:44,260
he shakes it loose," ordered the ray technician.

1636
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:47,429
"He'll wiggle if you start off with the beam.

1637
01:48:47,429 --> 01:48:52,690
Train your sights on the nose of that first
ship—when you're ready, call out."

1638
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:56,159
"Ready—ready—" Ten men replied.

1639
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:57,159
"Fire!"

1640
01:48:57,159 --> 01:48:58,639
roared the technician.

1641
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:05,429
Ten titanic swords of pure ultra-violet energy,
energy that practically no unconditioned metal

1642
01:49:05,429 --> 01:49:09,840
will reflect to more than fifty per cent,
emerged.

1643
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:15,989
There was a single spot of intense incandescence
for a single hundredth of a second—and then

1644
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:21,170
the energy was burning its way through the
inner, thinner skins with such rapidity that

1645
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:25,949
they sputtered and flickered like a broken
televisor.

1646
01:49:25,949 --> 01:49:30,949
One hundred and twenty-nine ships retreated
hastily for conference, leaving a gutted,

1647
01:49:30,949 --> 01:49:34,809
wrecked hull, broken by its fall, on Europa.

1648
01:49:34,809 --> 01:49:40,730
Triumphantly, the Europa IP station hurled
out its radio message of the first encounter

1649
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:44,380
between a fort and the Miran forces.

1650
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:49,590
Most important of all, it sent a great deal
of badly wanted information regarding the

1651
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:51,530
Miran weapons.

1652
01:49:51,530 --> 01:49:56,829
Particularly interesting was the fact that
it had withstood the impact of that disintegrating

1653
01:49:56,829 --> 01:50:06,900
ray.

1654
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:20,320
VIII
Grimly Buck Kendall looked at the reports.

1655
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,369
McLaurin stood beside him, Devin sat across
the table from him.

1656
01:50:23,369 --> 01:50:26,920
"What do you make of it, Buck?" asked the
Commander.

1657
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:32,010
"That we have just one island of resistance
left on the Jovian worlds.

1658
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:34,159
And that will, I fear, vanish.

1659
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:36,960
They haven't finished with their arsenal by
any means."

1660
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:41,659
"But what was it, man, what was it that ruined
those ships?"

1661
01:50:41,659 --> 01:50:43,070
"Vibration.

1662
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:48,960
Somehow—Lord only knows how it's done—they
can project electric fields.

1663
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,800
These projected fields are oscillated, and
they are tuned in with some parts of the ship.

1664
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,809
I suspect they are crystals of the metals.

1665
01:50:56,809 --> 01:51:02,309
If they can start a vibration in the crystals
of the metal—that's fatigue, metal fatigue

1666
01:51:02,309 --> 01:51:04,389
enormously speeded.

1667
01:51:04,389 --> 01:51:08,820
You know how a quartz crystal oscillator in
a radio-control apparatus will break, if you

1668
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,789
work it on a very heavy load at the peak?

1669
01:51:11,789 --> 01:51:15,580
They simply smash the crystals of metal in
the same way.

1670
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,159
Only they project their field."

1671
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:22,079
"Then our toughest metals are useless?

1672
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:26,980
Can't something tough, rather than hard, like
copper or even silver for instance, stand

1673
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:27,980
it?"

1674
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:32,260
"Calcium metal's the toughest going—and
even that would break under the beating those

1675
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,929
ships give it.

1676
01:51:33,929 --> 01:51:38,199
The only way to withstand it is to have such
a mass of metal that the oscillations are

1677
01:51:38,199 --> 01:51:39,789
damped out.

1678
01:51:39,789 --> 01:51:40,889
But—"

1679
01:51:40,889 --> 01:51:45,119
The set tuned in on the IP station on Europa
was speaking again.

1680
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:47,080
"The ships are returning.

1681
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:50,300
There are one hundred and twenty-nine by accurate
count.

1682
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:55,320
Jorgsen reports that telescopic observation
of the dead on the fallen cruiser show them

1683
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:57,580
to be a completely un-human race!

1684
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:01,409
They are of mottled coloring, predominately
grayish brown.

1685
01:52:01,409 --> 01:52:03,570
The ships are returning.

1686
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:09,500
They have divided into ten groups, nine groups
of two each, and a main body of the rest of

1687
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,639
the fleet.

1688
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:16,150
The group of eighteen is descending within
range, and we are focusing our beams on them—"

1689
01:52:16,150 --> 01:52:23,600
Out by Europa, ten great UV beams were stabbing
angrily toward ten great interstellar ships.

1690
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:29,710
The metal of the hulls glowed brilliant, and
distorted slowly as the thick walls softened

1691
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:32,000
under the heat, and the air behind pressed
against it.

1692
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,650
Grimly the ten ships came on.

1693
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:41,170
Torpedoes were being launched, and exploded,
and now they had no effect, for the Mirans

1694
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:44,039
within were protected.

1695
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:48,369
The eighteen grouped ships separated, and
arranged themselves in a circle around the

1696
01:52:48,369 --> 01:52:49,670
fort.

1697
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:54,219
Suddenly one staggered as a great puff of
gas shot out through the thin atmosphere of

1698
01:52:54,219 --> 01:52:59,640
Europa to flare brilliantly in the lash of
the stabbing UV beam.

1699
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:03,400
Instantly the ship righted itself, and labored
upward.

1700
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:06,150
Another dropped to take its place—

1701
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:12,019
And the great walls of the IP fort suddenly
groaned and started in their welded joints.

1702
01:53:12,019 --> 01:53:17,099
The faint, whispering rustle of the crumbling
beam was murmuring through the station.

1703
01:53:17,099 --> 01:53:21,820
Engineers shouted suddenly as meters leapt
the length of their scales, and the needles

1704
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:24,269
clicked softly on the stop pins.

1705
01:53:24,269 --> 01:53:29,900
A thin rustle came from the atostors grouped
in the great power room.

1706
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:34,510
"Spirits of Space—a revolving magnetic field!"

1707
01:53:34,510 --> 01:53:35,760
roared the Chief Technician.

1708
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,260
"They're making this whole blasted station
a squirrel cage!"

1709
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:45,369
The mighty walls of eight-foot metal shuddered
and trembled.

1710
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:51,960
The UV beams lashed out from the fort in quivering
arcs now, they did not hold their aim steady,

1711
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:56,590
and the magnetic shield that protected them
from atomic bombs was working and straining

1712
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:57,590
wildly.

1713
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:03,500
Eighteen great ships quivered and tugged outside
there now, straining with all their power

1714
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:09,099
to remain in the same spot, as they passed
on from one to another the magnetic impulses

1715
01:54:09,099 --> 01:54:14,420
that were now creating a titanic magnetic
vortex about the fort.

1716
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:19,620
"The atostors will be exhausted in another
fifteen minutes," the Chief Technician roared

1717
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,869
into his transmitter.

1718
01:54:20,869 --> 01:54:23,639
"Can the signals get through those fields,
Commander?"

1719
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:24,790
"No, Mac.

1720
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:27,560
They've been stopped, Sparks tells me.

1721
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:30,280
We're here—and let's hope we stay.

1722
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,570
What's happening?"

1723
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:36,900
"They've got a revolving magnetic field out
there that would spin a minor planet.

1724
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:42,110
The whole blasted fort is acting like the
squirrel cage in an induction motor!

1725
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:46,639
They've made us the armature in a five hundred
million horsepower electric motor."

1726
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,960
"They can't tear this place loose, can they?"

1727
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:54,780
"I don't know—it was never—" The Chief
stopped.

1728
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:57,699
Outside a terrific roar and crash had built
up.

1729
01:54:57,699 --> 01:55:03,639
White darts of flame leapt a thousand feet
into the air, hurling terrific masses of shattered

1730
01:55:03,639 --> 01:55:05,619
rock and soil.

1731
01:55:05,619 --> 01:55:11,750
"I was going to say," the Chief went on, "this
place wasn't designed for that sort of a strain.

1732
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:16,429
Our own magnetic field is supporting us now,
preventing their magnetic field from getting

1733
01:55:16,429 --> 01:55:17,789
its teeth on metal.

1734
01:55:17,789 --> 01:55:23,960
When the strain comes—well, they're cutting
loose our foundation with atomic bombs!"

1735
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:28,410
Five UV beams were combined on one interstellar
ship.

1736
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:31,989
Instantly the great machine retreated, and
another dropped in to take its place while

1737
01:55:31,989 --> 01:55:35,300
the magnetic field spun on, uninterruptedly.

1738
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,890
"Can they keep that up long?"

1739
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:43,469
"God knows—but they have a hundred and more
ships to send in when the power of one gives

1740
01:55:43,469 --> 01:55:44,670
out, remember."

1741
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:47,360
"What's our reserve now?"

1742
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,889
The Chief paused a moment to look at the meters.

1743
01:55:49,889 --> 01:55:53,739
"Half what it was ten minutes ago!"

1744
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:56,320
Commander Wallace sent some other orders.

1745
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:02,489
Every torpedo tube of the station suddenly
belched forth deadly, fifteen-foot torpedoes,

1746
01:56:02,489 --> 01:56:07,500
most of them mud-torpedoes, torpedoes loaded
with high explosive in the nose, a delayed

1747
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,309
fuse, and a load of soft clinging mud in the
rear.

1748
01:56:11,309 --> 01:56:16,200
The mud would flow down over the nose and
offer a resistance foot-hold for the explosive

1749
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,079
which empty space would not.

1750
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:24,280
Four hundred and three torpedoes, equipped
with anti-magnetic apparatus darted out.

1751
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:28,280
One hundred and four passed the struggling
fields.

1752
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:34,239
One found lodgement on a Miran ship, and crushed
in a metal wall, to be stopped by a bulkhead.

1753
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,789
The Chief engineer watched his power declining.

1754
01:56:37,789 --> 01:56:44,380
All ten UV beams were united in one now, driving
a terrible sword of energy that made the attacked

1755
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:49,340
ship skip for safety instantly, yet the beams
were all but useless.

1756
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:55,480
For the Miran reserves filled the gap, and
the magnetic tornado continued.

1757
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:59,539
For seventeen long minutes the station resisted
the attack.

1758
01:56:59,539 --> 01:57:05,280
Then the last of the strained mercury flowed
into the receivers, and the vast power of

1759
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:08,280
the atostors was exhausted.

1760
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,770
Slowly the magnetic fields declined.

1761
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:16,260
The great walls of the station felt the clutching
lines of force—they began to heat and to

1762
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:17,260
strain.

1763
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:22,949
A low, harsh grinding became audible over
the roar of the atomic bombs.

1764
01:57:22,949 --> 01:57:25,980
The whole structure trembled, and jumped slightly.

1765
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:31,849
The roar of bombs ceased suddenly, as the
station jerked again, more violently.

1766
01:57:31,849 --> 01:57:35,829
Then it turned a bit, rolled clumsily.

1767
01:57:35,829 --> 01:57:39,179
Abruptly it began to spin violently, more
and more rapidly.

1768
01:57:39,179 --> 01:57:43,869
It started rolling clumsily across the plateau—

1769
01:57:43,869 --> 01:57:49,659
A rain of atomic bombs struck the unprotected
metal, and the eighth breached the walls.

1770
01:57:49,659 --> 01:57:51,869
The twentieth was the last.

1771
01:57:51,869 --> 01:57:55,159
There was no longer an IP station on Europa.

1772
01:57:55,159 --> 01:58:00,840
"The difference," said Buck Kendall slowly,
when the reports came in from scout-ships

1773
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:05,989
in space that had witnessed the last struggle,
"between an atomic generator and an atomic

1774
01:58:05,989 --> 01:58:09,309
power-store, or accumulator, is clearly shown.

1775
01:58:09,309 --> 01:58:13,260
We haven't an adequate source of power."

1776
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:16,039
McLaurin sighed slowly, and rose to his feet.

1777
01:58:16,039 --> 01:58:17,599
"What can we do?"

1778
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:23,389
"Thank our lucky stars that Faragaut here,
and I, bought up all the mercury in the system,

1779
01:58:23,389 --> 01:58:25,139
and had it brought to Earth.

1780
01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:28,010
We at least have a supply of materials for
the atostors."

1781
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:30,119
"They don't seem to do much good."

1782
01:58:30,119 --> 01:58:32,889
"They're the best we've got.

1783
01:58:32,889 --> 01:58:37,179
All the photocells on Earth and Venus and
Mercury are at present busy storing the sun's

1784
01:58:37,179 --> 01:58:39,539
power in atostors.

1785
01:58:39,539 --> 01:58:44,030
I have two thousand tons of charged mercury
in our tanks here in the 'Lunar Bank.'"

1786
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:49,600
"Much good that will do—they can just pull
and pull and pull till it's all gone.

1787
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:54,720
A starfish isn't strong, but he can open the
strongest oyster just because he can pull

1788
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,960
from now on.

1789
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,870
You may have a lot of power—but."

1790
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:04,210
"But—we also have those new fifteen-foot
UV beams.

1791
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:10,910
And one fifteen-foot UV beam is worth, theoretically,
nine five-foot beams, and practically, a dozen.

1792
01:59:10,910 --> 01:59:12,540
We have a dozen of them.

1793
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:18,369
Remember, this place was designed not only
to protect itself, but Earth, too."

1794
01:59:18,369 --> 01:59:20,949
"They can still pull, can't they?"

1795
01:59:20,949 --> 01:59:24,540
"They'll stop pulling when they get their
fingers burned.

1796
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:29,019
In the meantime, why not use some of those
IP ships to bring in a few more cargoes of

1797
01:59:29,019 --> 01:59:30,219
charged mercury?"

1798
01:59:30,219 --> 01:59:33,030
"They aren't good for much else, are they?

1799
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:36,789
I wonder if those fellows have anything more
we don't know?"

1800
01:59:36,789 --> 01:59:39,260
"Oh, probably.

1801
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:41,309
I'm going to work on that crumbler thing.

1802
01:59:41,309 --> 01:59:43,510
That's the first consideration now."

1803
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,510
"Why?"

1804
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:47,090
"So we can move a ship.

1805
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:50,000
As it is, even those two we built aren't any
good."

1806
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,880
"Would they be anyway?"

1807
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:57,210
"Well—I think I might disturb those gentlemen
slightly.

1808
01:59:57,210 --> 02:00:02,349
Remember, they each have a nose-beam eighteen
feet across.

1809
02:00:02,349 --> 02:00:04,060
Exceedingly unpleasant customers."

1810
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:11,409
"Score: Strangers; magnetic field, atomic
bombs, atomic power, crumbler ray.

1811
02:00:11,409 --> 02:00:15,000
Home team; UV beams."

1812
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Kendall grinned.

1813
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,329
"I'd heard you were a pessimistic cuss when
battle started—"

1814
02:00:19,329 --> 02:00:22,289
"Pessimistic, hell, I'm merely counting things
up."

1815
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:27,829
"McClellan had all the odds on Lee back in
the Civil War of the States—but Lee sent

1816
02:00:27,829 --> 02:00:30,099
him home faster than he came."

1817
02:00:30,099 --> 02:00:32,400
"But Lee lost in the end."

1818
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:33,769
"Why bring that up?

1819
02:00:33,769 --> 02:00:35,770
I've got work to do."

1820
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:40,369
Still smiling, Kendall went to the laboratory
he had built up in the "Lunar Bank."

1821
02:00:40,369 --> 02:00:42,789
Devin was already there, calculating.

1822
02:00:42,789 --> 02:00:44,420
He looked unhappy.

1823
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:48,119
"We can't do anything, as far as I can see.

1824
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:51,080
They're using an electric field all right,
and projecting it.

1825
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:53,449
I can't see how we can do that."

1826
02:00:53,449 --> 02:00:58,449
"Neither can I," agreed Kendall, "so we can't
use that weapon.

1827
02:00:58,449 --> 02:01:00,050
I really didn't want to anyway.

1828
02:01:00,050 --> 02:01:04,861
Like the neutron gun which I told Commander
McLaurin would be useless as a weapon, they'd

1829
02:01:04,861 --> 02:01:07,860
be prepared for it, you can be sure.

1830
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:12,020
All I want to do is fight it, and make their
projection useless."

1831
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:17,150
"Well, we have to know how they project it
before we can break up the projection, don't

1832
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:18,150
we?"

1833
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:19,179
"Not at all.

1834
02:01:19,179 --> 02:01:23,869
They're using an electric field of very high
frequency, but variable frequency.

1835
02:01:23,869 --> 02:01:30,400
As far as I can see, all we need is a similar
variable electric field of a slightly different

1836
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:34,760
frequency to heterodyne theirs into something
quite harmless."

1837
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,420
"Oh," said Devin.

1838
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:38,739
"We could, couldn't we?

1839
02:01:38,739 --> 02:01:40,120
But how are you going to do that?"

1840
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:44,059
"We'll have to learn, that's all."

1841
02:01:44,059 --> 02:01:46,949
Buck Kendall started trying to learn.

1842
02:01:46,949 --> 02:01:51,880
In the meantime, the Mirans were taking over
Jupiter.

1843
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,260
There were three IP stations on the planet
itself, but they were vastly hindered by the

1844
02:01:56,260 --> 02:02:00,059
thick, almost ultra-violet-proof atmosphere
of Jupiter.

1845
02:02:00,059 --> 02:02:01,849
Their rays were weak.

1846
02:02:01,849 --> 02:02:05,260
And the magnetic fields of the Mirans were
unaffected.

1847
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:09,389
Only their atomic bombs were hindered by the
heavier gravity that pulled the rocks back

1848
02:02:09,389 --> 02:02:12,770
in place faster than the bombs could throw
them out.

1849
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:18,429
Still—a few hours of work, and the IP stations
on Jupiter had rolled wildly across the flat

1850
02:02:18,429 --> 02:02:23,280
plains of the planet like dented cans, to
end in utter destruction.

1851
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:27,639
The Mirans had paid no attention to the fleeing
passenger and freighter ships that left the

1852
02:02:27,639 --> 02:02:32,389
planet, loaded to the utmost with human cargo,
and absolutely no freight.

1853
02:02:32,389 --> 02:02:37,410
The IP fleet had to go to their rescue with
oxygen tanks to take care of the extra humans,

1854
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:42,119
but nearly three-quarters of the population
of Jupiter, a newly established population,

1855
02:02:42,119 --> 02:02:45,340
and hence a readily mobile one, was saved.

1856
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:49,150
The others, the Mirans did not bother with
particularly except when they happened to

1857
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:51,849
be near where the Mirans wanted to work.

1858
02:02:51,849 --> 02:02:55,450
Then they were instantly destroyed by atomic
bombing, or gamma rays.

1859
02:02:55,450 --> 02:03:01,179
The Mirans settled almost at once, and began
their work of finding on Jupiter the badly

1860
02:03:01,179 --> 02:03:03,059
needed atomic fuels.

1861
02:03:03,059 --> 02:03:09,250
Machines were set up, and work begun, Mirans
laboring under the gravity of the heavy planet.

1862
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:14,570
Then, fifty ships swam up again, reloaded
with fuel, and with crews consisting solely

1863
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:18,770
of uninjured warriors, and started for Mars.

1864
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:23,789
Mars was half way between her near conjunction
and her maximum elongation with respect to

1865
02:03:23,789 --> 02:03:25,690
Jupiter at that time.

1866
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:30,840
The Mirans knew their business though, for
they started in on the IP station on Phobos.

1867
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:36,520
They were practiced by this time, and this
IP station had only seven five-foot beams.

1868
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:41,830
In half an hour that station fell, and its
sister station on Deimos followed.

1869
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:46,119
Three wounded ships returned to Jupiter, and
ten new ships came out.

1870
02:03:46,119 --> 02:03:50,260
The attack on Mars itself was started.

1871
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:51,719
Mars was a different proposition.

1872
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:58,410
There were thirty-two IP stations here, one
of them nearly as powerful as the Lunar Bank

1873
02:03:58,410 --> 02:03:59,410
station.

1874
02:03:59,410 --> 02:04:03,639
It was equipped with four of the huge fifteen-foot
beams.

1875
02:04:03,639 --> 02:04:08,750
And it had fifteen tons of mercury, more than
seven-eighths charged.

1876
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:14,099
The Mars Center Station was located a short
ten miles from the Mars Center City, and under

1877
02:04:14,099 --> 02:04:18,719
the immediate orders of the IP heads, Mars
Center City had been vacated.

1878
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:26,230
For two days the Mirans hung off Mars, solidifying
their positions on Phobos and Deimos.

1879
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:29,900
Then, with sixty-two ships, they attacked.

1880
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:35,130
They had made some very astute observations,
and they started on the smaller stations just

1881
02:04:35,130 --> 02:04:38,190
beyond the range of the Mars Center Station.

1882
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:42,869
Naturally, near so powerful a center, these
stations had never been strong.

1883
02:04:42,869 --> 02:04:44,420
They fell rapidly.

1884
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:48,869
But they had been counted on by Mars Center
as auxiliary supports.

1885
02:04:48,869 --> 02:04:53,699
McLaurin had sent very definite orders to
Mars Center forbidding any action on their

1886
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:56,780
part, save gathering of power-supplies.

1887
02:04:56,780 --> 02:05:01,050
At last the direct attack on Mars Center was
launched.

1888
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:05,750
For the first time, the Mirans saw one of
the fifteen-foot beams.

1889
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:09,059
Mars' atmosphere is thin, and there is little
ozone.

1890
02:05:09,059 --> 02:05:12,880
The ultra-violet beams were nearly as effective
as in empty space.

1891
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:18,670
When the Mirans dropped their ships, a full
thirty of them, into the circle formation,

1892
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:20,909
Mars Center answered at once.

1893
02:05:20,909 --> 02:05:24,300
All four beams started.

1894
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:30,110
Those fifteen-foot beams, connected directly
to huge atostor release apparatus, delivered

1895
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:34,079
a maximum power of two and three-quarter billion
horsepower, each.

1896
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:40,570
The first Miran ship struck, sparkled magnificently,
and a terrific cascade of white-hot metal

1897
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:42,400
rolled down from its nose.

1898
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:47,909
The great ship nosed down and to the left
abruptly, accelerated swiftly—and crashed

1899
02:05:47,909 --> 02:05:51,920
with tremendous energy on the plain outside
of Mars Center City.

1900
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:57,829
White, unwavering flames licked up suddenly,
and made a column five hundred feet high against

1901
02:05:57,829 --> 02:05:59,650
the dark sky.

1902
02:05:59,650 --> 02:06:04,790
Then the wreck exploded with a violence that
left a crater half a mile across.

1903
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:07,929
Three other ships had been struck, and were
rapidly retreating.

1904
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:13,730
Another try was made for the ring formation,
and four more ships were wounded, and replaced.

1905
02:06:13,730 --> 02:06:18,619
The ring did not retreat, but the great magnetic
field started.

1906
02:06:18,619 --> 02:06:24,170
Atomic and gamma ray bombs started now, flashing
sometimes dangerously close to the station

1907
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:28,769
as its magnetic field battled the rotating
field of the ships.

1908
02:06:28,769 --> 02:06:33,080
The four greater beams, and many smaller ones
were in swift and angry action.

1909
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:38,659
Not more than a ten-second exposure could
be endured by any one ship, before it must

1910
02:06:38,659 --> 02:06:40,059
retreat.

1911
02:06:40,059 --> 02:06:44,469
For five minutes the Mirans hung doggedly
at their task.

1912
02:06:44,469 --> 02:06:47,420
Then, wisely, they retreated.

1913
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:51,889
Of the fleet, not more than seven ships remained
untouched.

1914
02:06:51,889 --> 02:06:56,639
Mars Center Station had held—at what cost
only they knew.

1915
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:01,670
Five hundred tons of their mercury had been
exhausted in that brief five minutes.

1916
02:07:01,670 --> 02:07:06,000
One hundred tons a minute had flowed into
and out of the atostor apparatus.

1917
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,309
Mars Center radioed for help, when the fleet
lifted.

1918
02:07:10,309 --> 02:07:16,120
There was one other station on Mars that stood
a good chance of survival, Deenmor Station,

1919
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:21,110
with three of the big beams installed, and
apparatus for their fourth was in the station,

1920
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:24,070
and being rapidly worked over.

1921
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:28,469
McLaurin did a wise and courageous thing,
at which every man on Mars cursed.

1922
02:07:28,469 --> 02:07:34,980
He ordered that all IP stations save these
two be deserted, and all mercury fuel reserves

1923
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:39,139
be moved to Deenmor and Mars Center.

1924
02:07:39,139 --> 02:07:44,599
The Mirans could not land on the North Western
section of Mars, nor in the South Central

1925
02:07:44,599 --> 02:07:45,599
region.

1926
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:50,130
Therefore Mars was not exactly habitable to
Miran ships, because the great beams had been

1927
02:07:50,130 --> 02:07:55,679
so perfectly figured that they were effective
at a range of nearly twelve hundred miles.

1928
02:07:55,679 --> 02:08:00,699
Deenmor station was attacked—but it was
a half-hearted attack, for Mirans were becoming

1929
02:08:00,699 --> 02:08:04,550
distinctly skittish about fifteen-foot UV
beams.

1930
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:09,050
Two badly blistered ships—and the Mirans
retreated to Jupiter.

1931
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:11,980
But Mira held Phobos and Deimos.

1932
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:17,230
In two weeks, they had set up cannon there,
and proved themselves accurate long-range

1933
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:18,230
gunners.

1934
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:22,900
Against the feeble attraction of Deimos, and
with Mars' gravity to help them, they began

1935
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:27,510
bombarding the two stations, and anything
that attempted to approach them, with gamma

1936
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:30,489
and atomic explosive bombs.

1937
02:08:30,489 --> 02:08:35,599
Meanwhile they amused themselves occasionally
by planting a gamma-ray bomb in each of Mars'

1938
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:36,650
major cities.

1939
02:08:36,650 --> 02:08:42,690
They made Mars uninhabitable for Solarians
as well as for Mirans, at least until the

1940
02:08:42,690 --> 02:08:48,639
deadly slow-action atomic explosives wore
off, or were removed.

1941
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:54,429
Then the Mirans, after a lapse of three weeks
while they dug in their toes on Jupiter, prepared

1942
02:08:54,429 --> 02:08:55,429
to leap.

1943
02:08:55,429 --> 02:08:57,890
Earth was the next goal.

1944
02:08:57,890 --> 02:09:02,499
Miran scout-ships had been sent out before
this—and severely handled by the concentrated

1945
02:09:02,499 --> 02:09:06,949
fleets of the IP that hung grimly off Earth
and Luna now.

1946
02:09:06,949 --> 02:09:09,210
But the scouts had learned one thing.

1947
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:14,699
Mirans could never hope to attain a firm grasp
on Earth while terribly armed Luna hung like

1948
02:09:14,699 --> 02:09:17,520
a Sword of Damocles over their heads.

1949
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:22,880
Further, attack on Earth directly would be
next to impossible, for, thanks to Faragaut's

1950
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:28,400
Interplanetary Company, nearly all the mercury
metal in the system was safely lodged on Earth,

1951
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,480
and saturated with power.

1952
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:35,059
Every major city had been equipped with great
UV apparatus.

1953
02:09:35,059 --> 02:09:40,850
And neutron guns in plenty waited on small
ships just outside the atmosphere to explode

1954
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:46,159
harmlessly any atomic or gamma bombs Miran
ships might attempt to deposit.

1955
02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:49,610
An attack on Luna was the first step.

1956
02:09:49,610 --> 02:09:54,800
But that terrible, gigantic fort on Luna worried
them.

1957
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:59,980
Yet while that fort existed, Earth ships were
free to come and go, for Mirans could not

1958
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:02,409
afford to stand near.

1959
02:10:02,409 --> 02:10:07,139
At a distance of twenty thousand miles, small
Miran ships had felt the touch of those great

1960
02:10:07,139 --> 02:10:08,540
UV beams.

1961
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:14,050
Finally, a brief test-attack was made, with
an entire fleet of one hundred ships.

1962
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:18,780
They drew almost into position, faster than
light, faster than the signaling warnings

1963
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:20,450
could send their messages.

1964
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:26,630
In position, all those great ships strained
and heaved at the mighty magnetic vortex that

1965
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:29,010
twisted at the field of the fort.

1966
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:33,790
Instantly, twelve of the fifteen-foot UV beams
replied.

1967
02:10:33,790 --> 02:10:39,100
And—two great UV beams of a size the Mirans
had never seen before, beams from the two

1968
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:43,800
ships, "S Doradus" and "Cepheid."

1969
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:47,670
The test-attack dissolved as suddenly as it
had come.

1970
02:10:47,670 --> 02:10:51,949
The Mirans returned to Jupiter, and to the
outer planets where they had further established

1971
02:10:51,949 --> 02:10:53,280
themselves.

1972
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:55,710
Most of the Solar system was theirs.

1973
02:10:55,710 --> 02:11:00,860
But the Solarians still held the choicest
planets—and kept the Mirans from using the

1974
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:08,640
mild-temperatured Mars.

1975
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:24,219
IX
"They can't take this, at least," sighed McLaurin

1976
02:11:24,219 --> 02:11:26,199
as they retreated from Luna.

1977
02:11:26,199 --> 02:11:29,190
"I didn't think they could—right away.

1978
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:32,999
I'm wondering though if they haven't something
we haven't seen yet.

1979
02:11:32,999 --> 02:11:36,380
Besides which—give them time, give them
time."

1980
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:40,429
"Well, give us time, too," snapped McLaurin.

1981
02:11:40,429 --> 02:11:42,980
"How are you coming?"

1982
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:44,010
Buck smiled.

1983
02:11:44,010 --> 02:11:46,030
"I'm sure I don't know.

1984
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:51,530
I have a machine but I haven't the slightest
idea of whether or not it's any good."

1985
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:53,230
"Why not?"

1986
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:58,260
"I can destroy—I hope—but I can't build
up their ray.

1987
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:02,760
I can't test the machine because I haven't
their ray to test it against."

1988
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:05,090
"What can we do to test it?"

1989
02:12:05,090 --> 02:12:10,099
"The only thing I can see is to call for volunteers—and
send out a six-man cruiser.

1990
02:12:10,099 --> 02:12:14,880
If the ship's too small, they may not destroy
it with the big crumbler rays.

1991
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:21,119
If it's too large—and the machine didn't
work—we'd lose too much."

1992
02:12:21,119 --> 02:12:25,130
Twelve hours later, the IP men at the Lunar
Bank fort were lined up.

1993
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:32,099
McLaurin stepped up on the platform, and addressed
the men briefly, told them what was needed.

1994
02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:36,901
Six volunteers were selected by a process
of elimination, those who were married, had

1995
02:12:36,901 --> 02:12:40,140
dependents, officers, and others were refused.

1996
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:46,809
Finally, six men of the IP were chosen, neither
rookies nor veterans, six average men.

1997
02:12:46,809 --> 02:12:52,219
And one average six-man cruiser, one hundred
and eleven feet long, twenty-two in diameter.

1998
02:12:52,219 --> 02:12:59,999
It was the T-208, a sister ship of the T-247,
the first ship to be destroyed.

1999
02:12:59,999 --> 02:13:07,670
The T-208 started out from Luna, and with
full acceleration, sped out toward Phobos.

2000
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:12,150
Slowly she circled the satellite, while distant
scouts kept her under view.

2001
02:13:12,150 --> 02:13:19,429
Lazily, the Miran patrol on Phobos watched
the T-208, indifferent to her.

2002
02:13:19,429 --> 02:13:25,640
The T-208 dove suddenly, after five fruitless
circles of the tiny world, and with her four-foot

2003
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:30,940
UV beam flaming, stabbed angrily at a flight
of Miran scouts berthed in the very shadow

2004
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:36,289
of a great battle cruiser, one of the interstellar
ships stationed here on Phobos.

2005
02:13:36,289 --> 02:13:40,699
Four of the little ships slumped in incandescence.

2006
02:13:40,699 --> 02:13:45,440
Angrily the terrific sword of energy slashed
at the frail little scouts.

2007
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:51,829
Angrily the Miran interstellar ship shot herself
abruptly into action against this insolent

2008
02:13:51,829 --> 02:13:52,929
cruiser.

2009
02:13:52,929 --> 02:13:56,079
The cruiser launched a flight of the mercury-torpedoes.

2010
02:13:56,079 --> 02:14:02,349
Flashing, burning, ultra-violet energy flooded
the great ship, harmlessly, for the men were,

2011
02:14:02,349 --> 02:14:04,059
as usual, protected.

2012
02:14:04,059 --> 02:14:08,790
The Miran answered with the neutron beam,
atomic and gamma bombs—and the crumbler

2013
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:10,039
ray.

2014
02:14:10,039 --> 02:14:17,039
Gently, softly a halo of shimmering-violet
luminescence built up about the T-208.

2015
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:23,389
The UV beam continued to flare, wavering slightly
in its aim—then fell way off to one side.

2016
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:29,749
The T-208 staggered suddenly, wandered from
her course—whole, but uncontrolled.

2017
02:14:29,749 --> 02:14:32,699
For the men within the ship were dead.

2018
02:14:32,699 --> 02:14:38,199
Majestically the Miran swung along beside
the dead ship, a great magnetic tow-cable

2019
02:14:38,199 --> 02:14:43,820
shot out toward it, to shy off at first, then
slowly to be adjusted, and take hold in the

2020
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:47,059
magnetic shield of the T-208.

2021
02:14:47,059 --> 02:14:50,420
The pilots of the watching scout-ships turned
away.

2022
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:53,860
They knew what would happen.

2023
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:56,110
It did.

2024
02:14:56,110 --> 02:14:59,659
Five—ten—twenty seconds passed.

2025
02:14:59,659 --> 02:15:05,159
Then the "dead-man" took over the ship—and
the stored power in the atostor tanks blasted

2026
02:15:05,159 --> 02:15:11,570
in a terrible flame that shattered the metal
hull to molecular fragments.

2027
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:16,280
The interstellar cruiser shuddered, and rolled
half over at the blasting pressure.

2028
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:19,420
Leaking seams appeared in her plates.

2029
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:24,889
The scouts raced back to Luna as the Miran
settled heavily, and a trifle clumsily to

2030
02:15:24,889 --> 02:15:26,670
Phobos.

2031
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:31,369
Miran radio-beams were forcing their way out
toward the Miran station on Europa, to be

2032
02:15:31,369 --> 02:15:36,480
relayed to the headquarters on Jupiter, just
as Solarian radio beams were thrusting through

2033
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:43,980
space toward Luna. Said the Miran messages:
"Their ships no longer crumble."

2034
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:50,619
Said the Solarian messages: "The ships no
longer crumble—but the men die."

2035
02:15:50,619 --> 02:15:56,301
His deep eyes burning tensely, Buck Kendall
heard the messages coming in, and rose slowly

2036
02:15:56,301 --> 02:15:58,690
from his seat to pace the floor.

2037
02:15:58,690 --> 02:16:01,460
"I think I know why," he said at last.

2038
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:02,980
"I should have thought.

2039
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:04,820
For that too can be prevented."

2040
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:08,429
"Why—what in the name of the Planets?"

2041
02:16:08,429 --> 02:16:09,440
asked McLaurin.

2042
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:13,449
"It didn't kill the men in the forts—why
does it kill the men in the ships, when the

2043
02:16:13,449 --> 02:16:15,230
ships are protected?"

2044
02:16:15,230 --> 02:16:17,429
"The protection kills them."

2045
02:16:17,429 --> 02:16:21,409
"But—but they had the protective oscillations
on all the way out!"

2046
02:16:21,409 --> 02:16:22,989
protested the Commander.

2047
02:16:22,989 --> 02:16:25,519
"Think how it works though.

2048
02:16:25,519 --> 02:16:27,219
Think, man.

2049
02:16:27,219 --> 02:16:30,920
The enemy's field is an electric-field oscillation.

2050
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:36,590
We combat it by setting up a similar oscillating
field in the metal of the hull ourselves.

2051
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:39,690
Because the metal conducts the strains, they
meet, and oppose.

2052
02:16:39,690 --> 02:16:45,309
It is not a shield—a shield is impossible,
as I have said, because of energy concentration

2053
02:16:45,309 --> 02:16:46,309
factors.

2054
02:16:46,309 --> 02:16:52,800
If their beam carried a hundred thousand horsepower
in a ten-foot square beam, in every ten square

2055
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:55,860
feet of our shield, we'd have to have one
hundred thousand horsepower.

2056
02:16:55,860 --> 02:17:02,020
In other words, hundreds of times as much
energy would be needed in the shield, as they

2057
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:03,810
used in their beam.

2058
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:06,440
We can't afford that.

2059
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:12,389
We had to let the beams oppose our oscillations
in the metal, where, because the metal conducts,

2060
02:17:12,389 --> 02:17:15,380
they meet on an equal basis.

2061
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:20,809
But—when two oscillations of slightly different
frequency meet, what is the result?"

2062
02:17:20,809 --> 02:17:25,960
"In this case, a heterodyne frequency of a
lower, and harmless frequency."

2063
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,550
"So I thought.

2064
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:29,649
I was partly right.

2065
02:17:29,649 --> 02:17:31,950
It does not harm the metal.

2066
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:34,429
But it kills the men.

2067
02:17:34,429 --> 02:17:36,010
It is super-sonic.

2068
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:40,889
The terrible, shrill sounds destroy the cells
of the men's bodies.

2069
02:17:40,889 --> 02:17:46,880
Then, when their dead hands release the controls,
the automatic switches blow up the ship."

2070
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,200
"God!

2071
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,859
We stop one menace—and it is like the Hydra.

2072
02:17:50,859 --> 02:17:53,750
For every head we lop off, two spring up."

2073
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:56,239
"Ah—but they are lesser heads.

2074
02:17:56,239 --> 02:18:00,200
Look, what is the fundamental difference between
sound and light?"

2075
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:08,000
"One is a vibration of matter and the—ah—eliminate
the material contact!"

2076
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,490
"Exactly!

2077
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:14,630
All we need to do is to let the ships operate
airless, the men in space suits.

2078
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:17,370
Then the air cannot carry the sounds to them.

2079
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:22,030
And by putting special damping materials in
their suits, we can stop the vibrations that

2080
02:18:22,030 --> 02:18:25,319
would reach them through their feet and hands.

2081
02:18:25,319 --> 02:18:31,490
Another six-man ship must go out—but this
ship will come back!"

2082
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:36,050
And with the order for another experimental
ship, went the orders for commercial supplies

2083
02:18:36,050 --> 02:18:37,530
of this new apparatus.

2084
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:42,670
Every IP ship must be equipped to resist it.

2085
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:46,189
Buck Kendall sailed on the six-man scout that
went out this time.

2086
02:18:46,189 --> 02:18:52,559
Again they swooped once at Phobos, again Miran
scout-ships crumbled under the attack of the

2087
02:18:52,559 --> 02:18:53,559
vicious UV beams.

2088
02:18:53,559 --> 02:18:57,800
The Mirans were not waiting contemptuously
this time.

2089
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:04,480
In an instant the great interstellar ship
rose from its berth, its weapons working angrily.

2090
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:08,190
The crumbler ray snapped out at the T-253.

2091
02:19:08,190 --> 02:19:13,130
Kendall stared into the periscope visor intently.

2092
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:17,099
Clumsily his padded hands worked at the specially
adapted controls.

2093
02:19:17,099 --> 02:19:22,160
The soft hiss of the oxygen release into his
suit disturbed him slightly.

2094
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:26,200
The radio-phones in his helmet carried all
the conversations in the ship to him with

2095
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,040
equal clarity.

2096
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,250
He watched as the great ship angled angrily
up—

2097
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:37,670
His vision was momentarily obscured by a violet
glow that built up and reached out gently

2098
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:42,030
from every point of metal in the ship.

2099
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:48,099
The instant Kendall saw that, the T-253 was
fleeing under his hands.

2100
02:19:48,099 --> 02:19:49,910
The test had been made.

2101
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:52,560
Now all he desired was safety again.

2102
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:58,600
The ion-rockets flared recklessly as, crushed
under an acceleration of four Earth-gravities,

2103
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:01,460
he sank heavily into his seat.

2104
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:07,140
Grimly the Miran ship was pursuing them, easily
keeping up with the fleeing midget.

2105
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:12,550
The crumbler became more intense, the violet
glow more vivid.

2106
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:16,540
The UV beam was reaching out directly behind
now.

2107
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,640
The—

2108
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:22,270
With a cry of agony, Kendall ripped the radio-phone
connection out of his suit.

2109
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:28,020
A soft hiss of leaking air warned him of too
great violence only minutes later.

2110
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:34,899
For his ears had been deafened by the sudden
shriek of a tremendous signal from outside!

2111
02:20:34,899 --> 02:20:37,120
Instantly Kendall knew what that meant.

2112
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:40,150
And he could not communicate with his men!

2113
02:20:40,150 --> 02:20:44,979
There was no metal in these special suits,
even the oxygen tanks were made of synthetic

2114
02:20:44,979 --> 02:20:47,439
plastics of tremendous strength.

2115
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:51,380
No scrap of vibrating metal was permissible.

2116
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:55,609
The padded gloves and boots protected him—but
there was a new and different type of crackle

2117
02:20:55,609 --> 02:20:58,530
and haze from the metal points now.

2118
02:20:58,530 --> 02:21:03,670
It was almost invisible in the practically
airless ship, but Kendall saw it.

2119
02:21:03,670 --> 02:21:09,210
Presently he felt it, as he desperately increased
his acceleration.

2120
02:21:09,210 --> 02:21:12,399
Slow creeping heat was attacking him.

2121
02:21:12,399 --> 02:21:14,860
The heat was increasing rapidly now.

2122
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:20,490
Desperately he was working at the crumbler-protection
controls—but immediately set them back as

2123
02:21:20,490 --> 02:21:21,490
they were.

2124
02:21:21,490 --> 02:21:26,260
He had to have the crumbler protection as
well—!

2125
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:30,239
Grimly the great Miran ship hung right beside
them.

2126
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:35,540
Angrily the two four-foot UV beams flashed
back—seeking some weak spot.

2127
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:37,440
There were none.

2128
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:42,180
At her absolute maximum of acceleration the
little ship plunged on.

2129
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:45,729
Gamma and atomic bombs were washing her in
flame.

2130
02:21:45,729 --> 02:21:50,561
The heavy blocks of paraffin between her walls
were long since melted, retained only by the

2131
02:21:50,561 --> 02:21:52,460
presence of the metal walls.

2132
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:59,819
Smoke was beginning to filter out now, and
Kendall recognized a new, and deadlier menace!

2133
02:21:59,819 --> 02:22:05,149
Heat—quantities of heat were being poured
into the little ship, and the neutron guns

2134
02:22:05,149 --> 02:22:08,260
were doing their best to add to it.

2135
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:13,279
The paraffin was confined in there—and like
any substance, it could be volatilized, and

2136
02:22:13,279 --> 02:22:18,710
as a vapor, develop pressure—explosive pressure!

2137
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:24,899
The Miran seemed satisfied in his tactics
so far—and changed them.

2138
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:29,390
Forty-seven million miles from Earth, the
Miran simply accelerated a bit more, and crowded

2139
02:22:29,390 --> 02:22:31,561
the Solarian ship a bit.

2140
02:22:31,561 --> 02:22:34,979
White-faced, Buck Kendall was forced to turn
a bit aside.

2141
02:22:34,979 --> 02:22:37,310
The Miran turned also.

2142
02:22:37,310 --> 02:22:40,689
Kendall turned a bit more—

2143
02:22:40,689 --> 02:22:46,649
Flashing across his range of vision at an
incredible speed, a tiny thing, no more than

2144
02:22:46,649 --> 02:22:51,729
twenty feet long and five in diameter, a scout-ship
appeared.

2145
02:22:51,729 --> 02:22:57,920
Its tiny nose ultra-violet beam was blasting
a solid cylinder of violet incandescence a

2146
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:03,810
foot across in the hull of the Miran—and,
to the Miran, angling swiftly across his range

2147
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:05,729
of vision.

2148
02:23:05,729 --> 02:23:12,140
Its magnetic field clashed for a thousandth
of a second with the T-253, instantly meeting,

2149
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:14,580
and absorbing the fringing edges.

2150
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:19,600
Then—it swept through the Miran's magnetic
shield as easily.

2151
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:24,520
The delicate instruments of the scout instantaneously
adjusted its own magnetic field as much as

2152
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:26,189
possible.

2153
02:23:26,189 --> 02:23:33,030
There was resistance, enormous resistance—the
ship crumpled in on itself, the tail vanished

2154
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:38,489
in dust as a sweeping crumbler beam caught
it at last—and the remaining portion of

2155
02:23:38,489 --> 02:23:42,910
the ship plowed into the nose of the Miran.

2156
02:23:42,910 --> 02:23:46,310
The Miran's force-control-room was wrecked.

2157
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:50,980
For perhaps a minute and a half, the ship
was without control, then the control was

2158
02:23:50,980 --> 02:23:56,210
re-established—and in vain the telescopes
and instruments searched for the T-253.

2159
02:23:56,210 --> 02:24:03,729
Lightless, her rockets out now, her fields
damped down to extinction, the T-253 was lost

2160
02:24:03,729 --> 02:24:08,540
in the pulsing, gyrating fields of half a
dozen scout-ships.

2161
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:12,500
Kendall looked grimly at the crushed spot
on the nose of the Miran.

2162
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:15,529
His ship was drifting slowly away from the
greater ship.

2163
02:24:15,529 --> 02:24:21,411
Presently, however, the Miran put on speed
in the direction of Earth, and the T-253 fell

2164
02:24:21,411 --> 02:24:23,529
far behind.

2165
02:24:23,529 --> 02:24:26,210
The Miran was not seriously injured.

2166
02:24:26,210 --> 02:24:32,020
But that scout pilot, in sacrificing life,
had thrown dust in their eyes for just those

2167
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:38,060
few moments Kendall had needed to lose a lightless
ship in lightless space—lightless—for

2168
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:40,310
the Mirans at any rate.

2169
02:24:40,310 --> 02:24:45,239
The IP ships had been covered with a black
paint, and in no time at all, Kendall had

2170
02:24:45,239 --> 02:24:50,649
gotten his ship into a position where the
energy radiations of the sun made him undetectable

2171
02:24:50,649 --> 02:24:56,270
from the Miran's position, since the radiation
of his own ship, even in the heat range, was

2172
02:24:56,270 --> 02:24:59,590
mingled with the direct radiation of the sun.

2173
02:24:59,590 --> 02:25:05,600
The sun was in the Miran's "eyes," both actual
and instrumental.

2174
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:10,060
An hour later the Miran returned, passed the
still-lightless ship at a distance of five

2175
02:25:10,060 --> 02:25:16,090
million miles, and settled to Phobos for the
slight repairs needed.

2176
02:25:16,090 --> 02:25:22,920
Twelve hours later, the T-253 settled to Luna,
for the many rearrangements she would need.

2177
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:28,939
"I rather knew it was coming," Kendall admitted
sadly, "but danged if I didn't forget all

2178
02:25:28,939 --> 02:25:30,310
about it.

2179
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:34,880
And—cost the life of one of the finest men
in the system.

2180
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:39,470
Jehnson's family get a permanent pension just
twice his salary, McLaurin.

2181
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:40,660
In the meantime—"

2182
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:42,489
"What was it?

2183
02:25:42,489 --> 02:25:44,370
Pure heat, but how?"

2184
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:46,020
"Pure radio.

2185
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:50,250
Nothing but short-wave radio directed at us.

2186
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:54,920
They probably had the apparatus, knew how
to make it, but that's not a good type of

2187
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:59,800
heat ray, because a radio tube is generally
less than eighty percent efficient, which

2188
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:05,270
is a whale of a loss when you're working in
a battle, and a whale of an inconvenience.

2189
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:09,021
We were heated only four times as much as
the Miran.

2190
02:26:09,021 --> 02:26:15,050
He had to pump that heat into a heat-reservoir—a
water tank probably—to protect himself.

2191
02:26:15,050 --> 02:26:18,140
Highly inefficient and ineffective against
a large ship.

2192
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:24,439
Also, he had to hold his beam on us nearly
ten minutes before it would have become unbearable.

2193
02:26:24,439 --> 02:26:27,729
He was again, trying to kill the men, and
not the ship.

2194
02:26:27,729 --> 02:26:31,060
The men are the weakest point, obviously."

2195
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:33,490
"Can you overcome that?"

2196
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:35,229
"Obviously, no.

2197
02:26:35,229 --> 02:26:37,100
The thing works on pure energy.

2198
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:40,660
I'd have to match his energy to neutralize
it.

2199
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:45,870
You knew it's an old proposition, that if
you could take a beam of pure, monochromatic

2200
02:26:45,870 --> 02:26:51,650
light and divide it exactly in half, and then
recombine it in perfect interference, you'd

2201
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:54,230
have annihilation of energy.

2202
02:26:54,230 --> 02:26:55,770
Cancellation to extinction.

2203
02:26:55,770 --> 02:26:59,229
The trouble is, you never do get that.

2204
02:26:59,229 --> 02:27:03,250
You can't get monochromatic light, because
light can't be monochromatic.

2205
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:09,240
That's due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty—my
pet bug-bear.

2206
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:12,029
The atom that radiates the light, must be
moving.

2207
02:27:12,029 --> 02:27:16,300
If it isn't, the emission of the light itself
gives it a kick that moves it.

2208
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:22,729
Now, no matter what the quantum might have
been, it loses energy in kicking the atom.

2209
02:27:22,729 --> 02:27:28,649
That changes the situation instantly, and
incidentally the 'color' of the light.

2210
02:27:28,649 --> 02:27:33,729
Then, since all the radiating atoms won't
be moving alike, etc., the mass of light can't

2211
02:27:33,729 --> 02:27:35,270
be monochromatic.

2212
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:39,580
Therefore perfect interference is impossible.

2213
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:45,920
"The way that relates to the problem in hand,
is that we can't possibly destroy his energy.

2214
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:49,689
We can, as we do in the crumbler stunt, change
it.

2215
02:27:49,689 --> 02:27:54,790
He can't, I suspect, put too much power behind
his crumbler, or he'd have crumbling going

2216
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:57,020
on at home.

2217
02:27:57,020 --> 02:28:00,000
We get a slight heating from it, anyway.

2218
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:05,860
Into the bargain, his radio was after us,
and his neutrons naturally carried energy.

2219
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:11,040
Now, no matter what we do, we've got that
to handle.

2220
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:15,360
When we fight his crumbler, we actually add
heat-energy to it, ourselves, and make the

2221
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:18,830
heating effect just twice as bad.

2222
02:28:18,830 --> 02:28:24,450
If we try to heterodyne his radio—presto—it
has twice the heat energy anyway, though we

2223
02:28:24,450 --> 02:28:29,660
might reduce it to a frequency that penetrated
the ship instead of all staying in it.

2224
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:35,660
But by the proposition, we have to use as
much energy, and in fact, remember the 80%

2225
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:36,660
rule.

2226
02:28:36,660 --> 02:28:39,160
We've got to take it and like it."

2227
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:43,580
"But," objected McLaurin, "we don't like it."

2228
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:47,939
"Then build ships as big as his, and he'll
quit trying to roast you.

2229
02:28:47,939 --> 02:28:51,260
Particularly if the inner walls are synthetic
plastics.

2230
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:55,840
Did you know I used them in the 'S Doradus'
and 'Cepheid'?"

2231
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:56,840
"Yes.

2232
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:58,750
Were you thinking of that?"

2233
02:28:58,750 --> 02:29:04,010
"No—just luck—and the fact that they're
light, strong as steel almost, and can be

2234
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:07,280
manufactured in forms much more quickly.

2235
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:09,950
Only the outer hull is tungsten-beryllium.

2236
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:15,340
The advantage in this will be that nearly
all the energy will be absorbed outside, and

2237
02:29:15,340 --> 02:29:20,910
we'll radiate pretty fast, particularly as
that tungsten-beryllium has a high radiation-factor

2238
02:29:20,910 --> 02:29:22,620
in the long heat range."

2239
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,819
"What does that mean?"

2240
02:29:24,819 --> 02:29:29,700
"Well, ordinary polished silver is a mighty
poor radiator.

2241
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:35,300
Homely example: Try waiting for your coffee
to cool if it's in a polished silver pot.

2242
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:38,780
Then try it in a tungsten-beryllium pot.

2243
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:44,240
No matter how you polish that tungsten-beryllium,
the stuff WILL radiate heat.

2244
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:48,220
That's why an IP ship is always so blamed
cold.

2245
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:52,359
You know the passenger ships use polished
aluminum outer walls.

2246
02:29:52,359 --> 02:29:57,040
The big help is, that the tungsten-beryllium
will throw off the energy pretty fast, and

2247
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:01,920
in a big ship, with a whale of a lot of matter
to heat, the Strangers will simply give up

2248
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,210
the idea."

2249
02:30:03,210 --> 02:30:07,439
"Yes, but only two ships in the system compare
with them in size."

2250
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:13,260
"Sorry—but I didn't build the IP fleet,
and there are lots of tungsten and beryllium

2251
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:14,260
on Earth.

2252
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:15,260
Enough anyway."

2253
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:17,729
"Will they use that beam on the fort?

2254
02:30:17,729 --> 02:30:19,630
And can't we use the thing on them?"

2255
02:30:19,630 --> 02:30:23,250
"They won't and we won't—though we could.

2256
02:30:23,250 --> 02:30:27,540
A bank of those new million watt tubes—perhaps
a hundred of them—and we'd have a pretty

2257
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:31,500
effective heater—but an awful waste of power.

2258
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:33,680
I've got something better."

2259
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:34,680
"New?"

2260
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:35,680
"Somewhat.

2261
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:40,740
I've found out how to make the mirror field
in a plate of metal, instead of a block.

2262
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:43,729
Come on to the lab, and I'll show you."

2263
02:30:43,729 --> 02:30:45,689
"What's the advantage?

2264
02:30:45,689 --> 02:30:48,189
Oh—weight saved, and silver metal saved."

2265
02:30:48,189 --> 02:30:51,580
"A lot more than that, Mac.

2266
02:30:51,580 --> 02:30:52,580
Watch."

2267
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:58,090
At the laboratory, the new apparatus looked
immensely lighter and simpler than the old.

2268
02:30:58,090 --> 02:31:05,300
The atostor, the ionizer, and the twin ion-projectors
were as before, great, rigid, metal structures

2269
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:10,319
that would maintain the meeting point of the
ions with inflexible exactitude under any

2270
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:12,560
acceleration strains.

2271
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:17,650
But now, instead of the heavy silver block
in which a mirror was figured, the mirror

2272
02:31:17,650 --> 02:31:23,140
consisted of a polished silver plate, parabolic
to be sure, but little more than a half-inch

2273
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:24,140
in thickness.

2274
02:31:24,140 --> 02:31:29,489
It was mounted in a framework of complex,
stout metal braces.

2275
02:31:29,489 --> 02:31:35,100
Kendall started the ion-flame at low intensity,
so the UV beam was little more than a spotlight.

2276
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:38,609
"You missed the point, Mac.

2277
02:31:38,609 --> 02:31:41,080
Now—watch that tungsten-beryllium plate.

2278
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:43,350
I'll hold the power steady.

2279
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:49,689
It's an eighteen-inch beam—and now the energy
is just sufficient to heat that tungsten plate

2280
02:31:49,689 --> 02:31:51,540
to bright red.

2281
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:52,960
But—"

2282
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:58,609
Kendall turned over a small rheostat control—and
abruptly the eighteen-inch diameter spot on

2283
02:31:58,609 --> 02:32:04,750
the tungsten-beryllium plate began contracting;
it contracted till it was a blazing, sparkling

2284
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:09,880
spot of molten incandescence less than an
inch across!

2285
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:13,600
"That's the advantage of focus.

2286
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:18,040
At this distance of a few hundred feet with
a small beam I can do that.

2287
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:23,510
With a twenty-foot beam, I can get a two-foot
spot at a distance of nearly ten miles!

2288
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:27,430
That means that the receiving end will have
the pleasure of handling one hundred times

2289
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:30,109
the energy concentration.

2290
02:32:30,109 --> 02:32:32,980
That would punch a hole through most anything.

2291
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:34,939
All you have to do is focus it.

2292
02:32:34,939 --> 02:32:39,170
The trouble being, if it's out of focus the
advantage is more than lost.

2293
02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:44,330
So if there's any question about getting the
focus, we'll get along without it."

2294
02:32:44,330 --> 02:32:47,290
"A real help, if you do.

2295
02:32:47,290 --> 02:32:52,000
That would punch a hole before the Stranger
ship could turn away as they do now."

2296
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Kendall nodded.

2297
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,020
"That's what I was after.

2298
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:56,850
It is mainly for the forts, though.

2299
02:32:56,850 --> 02:33:00,750
We'll have to signal the dope to the Mars
Center and Deenmor stations.

2300
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,850
They can fix it up, themselves.

2301
02:33:02,850 --> 02:33:08,650
In the meantime—all we can do is hold on
and hunt, and let's hope better than the Strangers

2302
02:33:08,650 --> 02:33:14,800
do."

2303
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:29,960
X
Sadly the convalescent Gresth Gkae listened

2304
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:32,820
to the reports of his lieutenants.

2305
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:37,970
More and more disgraced he felt as he realized
how badly he had blundered in reporting the

2306
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:41,770
people of this system unable to cope with
the attackers' weapons.

2307
02:33:41,770 --> 02:33:47,180
Gresth Gkae looked up at his old friend and
physician, Merth Skahl.

2308
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:48,950
He shook his head slowly.

2309
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:50,109
"I'm afraid, Merth Skahl.

2310
02:33:50,109 --> 02:33:54,069
I am afraid.

2311
02:33:54,069 --> 02:33:56,649
We have, perhaps, made a mistake.

2312
02:33:56,649 --> 02:33:59,310
The better and the stronger alone should rule.

2313
02:33:59,310 --> 02:34:03,200
Aye, but is the stronger always the better?

2314
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,990
I am afraid we have mistaken the Truth in
assuming this.

2315
02:34:06,990 --> 02:34:12,540
If we have—then may Jarth, Lord of Truth
and Wisdom punish us.

2316
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:17,989
Mighty Jarth, if I have mistaken in following
my judgments, it is not from disobedience,

2317
02:34:17,989 --> 02:34:20,270
it is lack of Thy knowledge.

2318
02:34:20,270 --> 02:34:24,820
The strongest—they are not always the better,
are they?"

2319
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:28,170
Merth Skahl bent sharply over his friend.

2320
02:34:28,170 --> 02:34:30,990
"Quiet thyself, Gresth Gkae.

2321
02:34:30,990 --> 02:34:36,880
You know, and I know, you have done only your
best, and surely Jarth himself can ask no

2322
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:38,970
better of any one.

2323
02:34:38,970 --> 02:34:43,440
You must rest, for only by rest can those
terrible burns be healed.

2324
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:48,280
All your stheen over half the body-area was
burned off.

2325
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:50,779
You have been delirious for many days."

2326
02:34:50,779 --> 02:34:55,810
"But Merth Skahl, think—have we disobeyed
Jarth's will?

2327
02:34:55,810 --> 02:35:01,510
It is, we know, his will that only the best
and the strongest shall rule—but are the

2328
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:03,850
best always the strongest?

2329
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:08,280
An imbecile adult could destroy the life of
a genius-grade child.

2330
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:13,101
The strongest wins, but not the best.

2331
02:35:13,101 --> 02:35:15,900
Such would not be the will of Jarth.

2332
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:21,170
If we be the stronger, and the best, then
it is right and just that these strange creatures

2333
02:35:21,170 --> 02:35:25,569
should be destroyed that we may have a stable
world of stable light and heat.

2334
02:35:25,569 --> 02:35:30,930
But look and see, with what terrible swiftness
these strange creatures have learned!

2335
02:35:30,930 --> 02:35:37,700
May it not be they are the better race—that
it is we who are the weaker and the poorer?

2336
02:35:37,700 --> 02:35:42,780
Can it be that Jarth has brought us together
that these people might learn—and destroy

2337
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:44,300
us?

2338
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:49,680
If they be the stronger, and the better—then
may Jarth's will be done.

2339
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:52,300
But we must test our strength to the utmost.

2340
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:55,700
I must rise, and go to my laboratory soon.

2341
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:57,649
They have set it up?"

2342
02:35:57,649 --> 02:35:59,700
"Aye, they have, Gresth Gkae.

2343
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:05,380
But remember, the weak and the sick make faults
the strong and the well do not.

2344
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:07,310
Better that you rest yourself.

2345
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:12,290
There is little you can do while your body
seeks to recover from these terrible burns."

2346
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:15,439
"You are wrong, my friend, wrong.

2347
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:22,810
Don't you see that my mind is clear—that
it is the mind which must fight in these battles,

2348
02:36:22,810 --> 02:36:26,750
for surely the man is weak against such things
as this infra-X-radiation?

2349
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:33,101
Why, I am better able to fight now than are
you, for I am a trained fighter of the mind,

2350
02:36:33,101 --> 02:36:36,439
while you are a trained healer of the body.

2351
02:36:36,439 --> 02:36:41,980
These strange beings with their stiff arms
and legs, their tender skins, and—and their

2352
02:36:41,980 --> 02:36:45,660
swift minds have fought us all too well.

2353
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:48,989
If we must test, let it be a test.

2354
02:36:48,989 --> 02:36:52,609
I have heard how they so quickly solved the
riddle of the crumbling field.

2355
02:36:52,609 --> 02:36:56,020
That took us longer, and we designed it.

2356
02:36:56,020 --> 02:37:01,550
The Counsel of Worlds put me in command, let
me up, Skahl, I must work."

2357
02:37:01,550 --> 02:37:04,939
Concerned, the physician looked down at him.

2358
02:37:04,939 --> 02:37:07,160
Finally he spoke again.

2359
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:11,399
"No, I will not permit you to leave the hospital-ship.

2360
02:37:11,399 --> 02:37:17,860
You must stay here, but if, as you have said,
the mind is what must fight, then surely you

2361
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:20,529
can fight well from here, for your mind is
here."

2362
02:37:20,529 --> 02:37:23,930
"No, I cannot, and you well know it.

2363
02:37:23,930 --> 02:37:27,109
I may shorten my life, but what matter.

2364
02:37:27,109 --> 02:37:32,640
'Death is the end toward which the chemical
reaction, Life, tends,'" quoted the scientist.

2365
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:37,290
"You know I have left my children—my immortality
is assured through them.

2366
02:37:37,290 --> 02:37:41,720
I can afford to die in peace, if it assures
their welfare.

2367
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:48,620
Time is precious, and while my mind might
work from here, it must have data on which

2368
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:49,620
to work.

2369
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:52,890
For that, I must go to the laboratories.

2370
02:37:52,890 --> 02:37:56,950
Help me, Merth Skahl."

2371
02:37:56,950 --> 02:38:02,890
Reluctantly the physician granted the request,
but begged of Gresth Gkae a promise of at

2372
02:38:02,890 --> 02:38:08,021
least six hours rest in every fifteen, and
a good sleep of at least twenty-seven hours

2373
02:38:08,021 --> 02:38:10,189
every "night."

2374
02:38:10,189 --> 02:38:16,660
Gresth Gkae agreed, and from a wheelchair,
conducted his work, began a new line of experimentation

2375
02:38:16,660 --> 02:38:20,010
he hoped would yield them the weapon they
needed.

2376
02:38:20,010 --> 02:38:25,960
Under him, the staff of scientists worked,
aiding and advising and suggesting.

2377
02:38:25,960 --> 02:38:30,590
The apparatus was built, tested, and found
wanting.

2378
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:36,740
Time and again as the days passed, they watched
Gresth Gkae, gaining strength very, very slowly,

2379
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:41,460
taken away despondent at the end of his forty
hours of work.

2380
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:47,260
A dozen expeditions were sent to Jupiter's
poles to watch and measure and study the tremendous

2381
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:53,890
auroral displays there, where Jupiter's vast
magnetic field sucked in countless quintillions

2382
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:59,521
of the flying electrons from the sun, and
brought them circling in, in a vast, magnificent

2383
02:38:59,521 --> 02:39:04,250
display of auroral ionization.

2384
02:39:04,250 --> 02:39:09,020
Expeditions went to the great Southern Plateau,
the Plateau of Storms, where the titanic air

2385
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:14,510
currents resulted in an everlasting display
of terrific lightnings, great burning balls

2386
02:39:14,510 --> 02:39:21,060
of electric force floating dangerous and deadly
across the frozen, ultra-cold plain.

2387
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:23,590
And the expeditions brought back data.

2388
02:39:23,590 --> 02:39:31,050
Yet still Gresth Gkae could not sleep, his
thoughts intruding constantly.

2389
02:39:31,050 --> 02:39:34,260
Hours Merth Skahl spent with him, calming
him to sleep.

2390
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:37,279
"But what is this constant search?

2391
02:39:37,279 --> 02:39:41,470
It is little enough I know of science, but
why do you send our men to these spots of

2392
02:39:41,470 --> 02:39:45,220
wonderfully beautiful, but useless natural
forces.

2393
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:50,530
Can we somehow, do you think, turn them against
the people of these worlds?"

2394
02:39:50,530 --> 02:39:52,870
Softly the old Miran smiled.

2395
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:55,600
"Yes, you might say so.

2396
02:39:55,600 --> 02:40:00,600
For look, it is the strange balls of electric
force I want to know about.

2397
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:04,689
Sthor had few, but occasionally we saw them.

2398
02:40:04,689 --> 02:40:07,100
Never were they properly investigated.

2399
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:12,930
I want to know their secret, for I am sure
they are balls of electric forces not vastly

2400
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:16,850
dissimilar from the nucleus of the atom.

2401
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:22,439
Always we have known that no system of purely
electrical forces could remain stable.

2402
02:40:22,439 --> 02:40:25,420
Yet these strange balls of energy do.

2403
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:27,110
How is it?

2404
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:30,380
I am sure it will be of vast importance.

2405
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:35,930
But the direct secret I hope to learn is in
this: What can be done with electric fields

2406
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:40,650
can nearly always be duplicated, or paralleled
in magnetic fields.

2407
02:40:40,650 --> 02:40:45,810
If I can learn how to make these electric
balls of energy, can I not hope to make similar

2408
02:40:45,810 --> 02:40:47,250
magnetic balls of energy?"

2409
02:40:47,250 --> 02:40:52,240
"Yes, I see—that would seem true.

2410
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:54,850
But what benefit would you derive from that?

2411
02:40:54,850 --> 02:40:59,270
You have magnetic beams now, and yet they
are useless because you can get nowhere near

2412
02:40:59,270 --> 02:41:00,359
the forts.

2413
02:41:00,359 --> 02:41:02,790
How then would these benefit you?"

2414
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:07,979
"We can do nothing to those forts, because
of that magnetic shield.

2415
02:41:07,979 --> 02:41:13,600
Could we once break it down, then the fort
is helpless, and one or two small atomic bombs

2416
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:14,729
destroy it.

2417
02:41:14,729 --> 02:41:21,010
But—we cannot stay near, for the terrible
infra-X-rays of theirs burn holes in our ships,

2418
02:41:21,010 --> 02:41:22,750
and—in our men.

2419
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:29,080
"But look you, I can drop many atomic bombs
from a distance where their beams are ineffective.

2420
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:34,160
Suppose I do make a magnetic ball of energy,
a magnetic bomb.

2421
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:37,760
Then—I can drop it from a distance!

2422
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:43,120
We have learned that the power supply of these
forts is very great—but not endless, as

2423
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:47,940
is ours now, thanks to the vast supplies of
power metal on this heavy planet.

2424
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:53,550
Then all we need do is stay at a distance
where they cannot reach us—and drop magnetic

2425
02:41:53,550 --> 02:41:54,550
bombs.

2426
02:41:54,550 --> 02:41:58,270
Ah, they will be stopped, and their energy
absorbed.

2427
02:41:58,270 --> 02:42:04,260
But we can keep it up, day after day, and
slowly drain out their power.

2428
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:09,120
Then—then our atomic bombs can destroy those
forts, and we can move on!"

2429
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:13,260
But suddenly the animation and strength left
his voice.

2430
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:16,850
He turned a sad, downcast face to his friend.

2431
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:21,779
"But Merth Skahl, we can't do it," he complained.

2432
02:42:21,779 --> 02:42:28,450
"Ah—now I can see why you so want to continue
this wearing and worrying work.

2433
02:42:28,450 --> 02:42:32,510
You need time, Gresth Gkae, only time for
success.

2434
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:37,600
Tomorrow it may be that you will see the first
hint that will lead you to success."

2435
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:44,260
"Ah—I only hope it, Merth Skahl, I only
hope it."

2436
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:51,399
But it was the next day that they saw the
first glimpse of the secret, and saw the path

2437
02:42:51,399 --> 02:42:54,590
that might lead to hope and success.

2438
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:57,800
In a week they were sending electric bombs
across the laboratory.

2439
02:42:57,800 --> 02:43:04,470
And in three days more, a magnetic bomb streaked
dully across the laboratory to a magnetic

2440
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:11,080
shield they had set up, and buried itself
in it, to explode in brilliant light and heat.

2441
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:15,300
From that day Gresth Gkae began to mend.

2442
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:19,580
In the three weeks that were needed to build
the apparatus into ships, he regained strength

2443
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:27,120
so that when the first flight of five interstellar
ships rose from Jupiter, he was on the flagship.

2444
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:33,160
To Phobos they went first, to the little inner
satellite of Mars, scarcely eight miles in

2445
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:40,390
diameter, a tiny bit of broken metal and rock,
utterly airless, but scarcely more than 3700

2446
02:43:40,390 --> 02:43:44,360
miles from the surface of Mars below.

2447
02:43:44,360 --> 02:43:50,520
The Mars Center and Deenmor forts were wasting
no power raying a ship at that distance.

2448
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:54,470
They could, of course, have damaged it, but
not severely enough to make up for the loss

2449
02:43:54,470 --> 02:43:56,520
of their strictly limited power.

2450
02:43:56,520 --> 02:44:02,189
The photocells had been working overtime,
every minute of available light had been used,

2451
02:44:02,189 --> 02:44:09,610
and still scarcely 2100 tons of charged mercury
remained in the tanks of Mars Center and 1950

2452
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:12,150
in the tanks at Deenmor.

2453
02:44:12,150 --> 02:44:17,050
The flight of five ships settled comfortably
upon Phobos, while the three relieved of duty

2454
02:44:17,050 --> 02:44:19,580
started back to Jupiter.

2455
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:22,250
Immediately work was begun on the attack.

2456
02:44:22,250 --> 02:44:28,200
The ships were first landed on the near side,
while the apparatus of the projectors was

2457
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:33,420
unloaded, then the great ships moved around
to the far side.

2458
02:44:33,420 --> 02:44:38,770
Phobos of course rotated with one face fixed
irrevocably toward Mars itself, the other

2459
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:42,979
always to the cold of space.

2460
02:44:42,979 --> 02:44:47,580
Great power leads trailed beneath the ships,
and to the dark side.

2461
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:51,020
Then there were huge water lines for cooling.

2462
02:44:51,020 --> 02:44:54,970
On this almost weightless world, where the
great ships weighing hundreds of thousands

2463
02:44:54,970 --> 02:45:00,250
of tons on a planet, weighed so little they
were frequently moved about by a single man,

2464
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:05,279
the laying of five miles of water conduit
was no impossibility.

2465
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:07,390
Then they were ready.

2466
02:45:07,390 --> 02:45:09,550
Mars Center came first.

2467
02:45:09,550 --> 02:45:15,640
Automatic devices kept the aim exact, as the
first of the magnetic bombs started down.

2468
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:22,120
At five-second intervals they were projected
outward, invisible globes of concentrated

2469
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:26,430
magnetic energy, undetectable in space.

2470
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:31,949
Seven seconds passed before the first became
dimly visible in the thin air of Mars.

2471
02:45:31,949 --> 02:45:37,910
It floated down, it would miss the fort it
seemed—so far to one side— Abruptly it

2472
02:45:37,910 --> 02:45:44,160
turned, and darted with tremendously accelerating
speed for the great magnetic field of the

2473
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:45,160
fort.

2474
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:48,420
With a vast blast of light, it exploded.

2475
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:51,790
Five seconds later a second exploded.

2476
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:54,850
And a third.

2477
02:45:54,850 --> 02:45:59,359
Mars Center signaled scoffingly that the bombs
were all being stopped dead in the magnetic

2478
02:45:59,359 --> 02:46:04,630
atmosphere, after the bombardment had been
witnessed from Earth and Luna.

2479
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:09,439
An hour later they gave a report that they
were concentrated magnetic fields of energy

2480
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:14,330
that would be rather dangerous—if it weren't
that they couldn't even stand into the magnetic

2481
02:46:14,330 --> 02:46:16,960
atmosphere.

2482
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:21,930
Three hours later Mars Center reported that
they contained considerably more energy than

2483
02:46:21,930 --> 02:46:23,819
had at first been thought.

2484
02:46:23,819 --> 02:46:30,060
Further, which they had not carefully considered
at first, they were taking energy with them!

2485
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:34,320
They were taking away about an equal amount
of energy as each blew up.

2486
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:39,450
It was only a half-hour after that that the
men at Mars Center realized perfectly what

2487
02:46:39,450 --> 02:46:40,930
it meant.

2488
02:46:40,930 --> 02:46:46,489
Their power was being drained just a little
bit better than twice as fast as they generated

2489
02:46:46,489 --> 02:46:52,149
during the day—and since Phobos spun so
swiftly across the sky.

2490
02:46:52,149 --> 02:46:57,570
Deenmor got the attack just about the time
Mars Center was released.

2491
02:46:57,570 --> 02:47:01,649
Deenmor immediately began seeking for the
source of it.

2492
02:47:01,649 --> 02:47:05,390
Somewhere on Phobos—but where?

2493
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:08,080
The Mirans were experts at camouflage.

2494
02:47:08,080 --> 02:47:13,350
Deenmor Station, realizing the menace, immediately
rayed the "projector."

2495
02:47:13,350 --> 02:47:17,790
They tore up a great deal of harmless rock
with their huge UV rays.

2496
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:23,210
But the bomb device continued to throw one
bomb each five seconds.

2497
02:47:23,210 --> 02:47:28,760
When Deenmor operated from Phobos' position,
Mars Center was exposed to the deadly, constant

2498
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:29,760
drain.

2499
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:35,340
A day or two later, the bombs were coming
one each second and a half, for more ships

2500
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:37,910
had joined in the work on Phobos.

2501
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:41,630
Gresth Gkae saw the work was going nicely.

2502
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:48,859
He knew that now it was only a question of
time before those magnetic shields would fail—and

2503
02:47:48,859 --> 02:47:51,670
then the whole fort would be powerless.

2504
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:57,590
Maybe—it might be a good idea, when the
forts were powerless to investigate instead

2505
02:47:57,590 --> 02:47:58,899
of blowing them up.

2506
02:47:58,899 --> 02:48:15,290
There might be many interesting and worthwhile
pieces 

2507
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:25,490
of apparatus—particularly the UV beam's
apparatus.

2508
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:29,930
XI
Buck Kendall entered the Communications room

2509
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:32,020
rather furtively.

2510
02:48:32,020 --> 02:48:34,220
He hated the place.

2511
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:36,810
Cole was there, and McLaurin.

2512
02:48:36,810 --> 02:48:41,890
Mac was looking tired and drawn, Cole not
so tired, but equally drawn.

2513
02:48:41,890 --> 02:48:46,800
The signals were coming through fairly well,
because most of the disturbance was rising

2514
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:51,670
where the signals rose, and all the disturbance,
practically, was magnetic rather than electric.

2515
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:56,850
"Deenmor is sending, Buck," McLaurin said
as he entered.

2516
02:48:56,850 --> 02:48:59,450
"They're down to the last fifty-five tons.

2517
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:03,750
They'll have more time now—a rest while
Phobos sinks.

2518
02:49:03,750 --> 02:49:08,050
Mars Center has another 250 tons, but—it's
just a question of time.

2519
02:49:08,050 --> 02:49:11,220
Have you any hope to offer?"

2520
02:49:11,220 --> 02:49:14,580
"No," said Kendall in a strained voice.

2521
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:18,950
"But, Mac, I don't think men like those are
afraid to die.

2522
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:21,790
It's dying uselessly they fear.

2523
02:49:21,790 --> 02:49:27,590
Tell 'em—tell 'em they've defended not alone
Mars, but all the system, in holding up the

2524
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:29,510
Strangers on Mars.

2525
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:32,390
We here on Luna have been safer because of
them.

2526
02:49:32,390 --> 02:49:37,689
And tell—Mac, tell them that in the meantime,
while they defended us, and gave us time to

2527
02:49:37,689 --> 02:49:41,180
work, we have begun to see the trail that
will lead to victory."

2528
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:43,720
"You have!"

2529
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:45,270
gasped McLaurin.

2530
02:49:45,270 --> 02:49:48,660
"No—but they will never know!"

2531
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:50,460
Kendall left hastily.

2532
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:56,370
He went and stood moodily looking at the calculator
machines—the calculator machines that refused

2533
02:49:56,370 --> 02:49:59,160
to give the answers he sought.

2534
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:04,850
No matter how he might modify that original
idea of his, no matter what different line

2535
02:50:04,850 --> 02:50:10,510
of attack he might try in solving the problems
of Space and Matter, while he used the system

2536
02:50:10,510 --> 02:50:16,040
he knew was right—the answer came down to
that deadly, hope-blasting expression that

2537
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:19,220
meant only "uncertain."

2538
02:50:19,220 --> 02:50:24,760
Even Buck was beginning to feel uncertain
under that constant crushing of hope.

2539
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:29,600
Uncertainty—uncertainty was eating into
him, and destroying—

2540
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:33,970
From the Communications room came the hum
and drive of the great sender flashing its

2541
02:50:33,970 --> 02:50:38,430
message across seventy-two millions of miles
of nothing.

2542
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:47,239

b-a-c-k t-h-e—"

2544
02:50:54,100 --> 02:50:56,270
Kendall switched on a noisy, humming fan viciously.

2545
02:50:56,270 --> 02:51:01,310
The too-intelligible signals were drowned
in its sound.

2546
02:51:01,310 --> 02:51:06,971
"And—tell them to—destroy the apparatus
before the last of the power is gone," McLaurin

2547
02:51:06,971 --> 02:51:09,600
ordered softly.

2548
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:14,470
The men in Deenmor station did slightly better
than that.

2549
02:51:14,470 --> 02:51:18,939
Gradually they cut down their magnetic shield,
and some of the magnetic bombs tore and twisted

2550
02:51:18,939 --> 02:51:22,479
viciously at the heavy metal walls.

2551
02:51:22,479 --> 02:51:25,689
The thin atmosphere of Mars leaked in.

2552
02:51:25,689 --> 02:51:27,940
Grimly the men waited.

2553
02:51:27,940 --> 02:51:30,390
Atomic bombs—or ships to investigate?

2554
02:51:30,390 --> 02:51:34,439
It did not matter much to them personally—

2555
02:51:34,439 --> 02:51:38,890
Gresth Gkae smiled with his old vigor as he
ordered one of the great interstellar ships

2556
02:51:38,890 --> 02:51:44,689
to land beside the powerless station, approaching
from such an angle that the still-active Mars

2557
02:51:44,689 --> 02:51:47,430
Center station could not attack.

2558
02:51:47,430 --> 02:51:52,470
One of the fleet of Phobos rose, and circled
about the planet, and settled gracefully beside

2559
02:51:52,470 --> 02:51:53,570
the station.

2560
02:51:53,570 --> 02:51:59,050
For half an hour it lay there quietly, waiting
and watching.

2561
02:51:59,050 --> 02:52:04,810
Then a crew of two dozen Mirans started across
the dry, crumbly powder of Mars' sands, toward

2562
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:07,580
the fort.

2563
02:52:07,580 --> 02:52:09,899
Simultaneously almost, three things happened.

2564
02:52:09,899 --> 02:52:14,020
A three-foot UV beam wiped out the advancing
party.

2565
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:19,310
A pair of fifteen-foot beams cut a great gaping
hole in the wall of the interstellar ship,

2566
02:52:19,310 --> 02:52:24,960
as it darted up, like a startled quail, its
weapons roaring defiance, only to fall back,

2567
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:27,360
severely wounded.

2568
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:32,420
And the radio messages pounded out to Earth
the first description of the Miran people.

2569
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:37,910
Methodically the men in Deenmor station used
all but one ton of their power to completely

2570
02:52:37,910 --> 02:52:42,810
and forever wreck and destroy the interstellar
cripple that floundered for a few moments

2571
02:52:42,810 --> 02:52:46,020
on the sands a bare mile away.

2572
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:52,319
Presently, before Deenmor was through with
it, the atomic bombs stopped coming, and the

2573
02:52:52,319 --> 02:52:54,149
atomic shells.

2574
02:52:54,149 --> 02:52:59,710
The magnetic shield that had been re-established
for the few minutes of this last, dying sting,

2575
02:52:59,710 --> 02:53:00,800
fell.

2576
02:53:00,800 --> 02:53:07,060
Deenmor station vanished in a sudden, colossal
tongue of blue-green light as the ton of atomically

2577
02:53:07,060 --> 02:53:11,819
distorted mercury was exploded by a projector
beam turned on the tank.

2578
02:53:11,819 --> 02:53:19,229
It was long gone, when the first atomic bombs
and magnetic bombs dropped from Phobos reached

2579
02:53:19,229 --> 02:53:25,100
the spot, and only hot rock and broken metal
remained.

2580
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:30,130
Mars Center failed in fact the next time Phobos
rode high over it.

2581
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:36,160
The apparatus here had been carefully destroyed
by technicians with a view of making it indecipherable,

2582
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:41,279
but the Mirans made it even more certain,
for no ship settled here to investigate, but

2583
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:47,430
a stream of atomic bombs that lasted for over
an hour, and churned the rock to dust, and

2584
02:53:47,430 --> 02:53:53,760
the dust to molten lava, in which pools of
fused tungsten-beryllium alloy bubbled slowly

2585
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:55,350
and sank.

2586
02:53:55,350 --> 02:54:02,609
"Ah, Jarth—they are a brave race, whatever
we may say of their queer shape," sighed Gresth

2587
02:54:02,609 --> 02:54:06,970
Gkae as the last of Mars Center sank in bubbling
lava.

2588
02:54:06,970 --> 02:54:10,560
"They stung as they died."

2589
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:13,710
For some minutes he was silent.

2590
02:54:13,710 --> 02:54:17,410
"We must move on," he said at length.

2591
02:54:17,410 --> 02:54:23,500
"I have been thinking, and it seems best that
a few ships land here, and establish a fort,

2592
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:28,840
while some twenty move on to the satellite
of the third planet and destroy the fort there.

2593
02:54:28,840 --> 02:54:34,939
We cannot operate against the planet while
that hangs above us."

2594
02:54:34,939 --> 02:54:39,779
Seven ships settled to Mars, while the fleet
came up from Jupiter to join with Gresth Gkae's

2595
02:54:39,779 --> 02:54:42,720
flight of ships on its way to Luna.

2596
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:47,270
An automatically controlled ship was sent
ahead, and began the bombardment.

2597
02:54:47,270 --> 02:54:53,189
It approached slowly, and was not destroyed
by the UV beams till it had come to within

2598
02:54:53,189 --> 02:54:55,890
40,000 miles of the fort.

2599
02:54:55,890 --> 02:55:04,290
At 60,000 Gresth Gkae stationed his fleet—and
returned to 150,000 immediately as the titanic

2600
02:55:04,290 --> 02:55:09,229
UV beams of the Lunar Fort stretched out to
their maximum range.

2601
02:55:09,229 --> 02:55:12,630
The focus made a difference.

2602
02:55:12,630 --> 02:55:17,380
One ship started limping back to Jupiter,
in tow of a second, while the rest began the

2603
02:55:17,380 --> 02:55:22,790
slow, methodical work of wearing down the
defenses of the Lunar Fort.

2604
02:55:22,790 --> 02:55:28,180
Kendall looked out at the magnificent display
of clashing, warring energies, the great,

2605
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:33,689
whirling spheres and discs of opalescent flame,
and turned away sadly.

2606
02:55:33,689 --> 02:55:37,740
"The men at Deenmor must have watched that
for days.

2607
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:38,979
And at Mars Center."

2608
02:55:38,979 --> 02:55:43,229
"How long can we hold out?" asked McLaurin.

2609
02:55:43,229 --> 02:55:46,960
"Three weeks or so, at the present rate.

2610
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:48,720
That's a long time, really.

2611
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:50,479
And we can escape if we want to.

2612
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:55,850
The UV beams here have a greater range than
any weapon the Strangers have, and with Earth

2613
02:55:55,850 --> 02:55:59,149
so near—oh, we could escape.

2614
02:55:59,149 --> 02:56:00,149
Little good."

2615
02:56:00,149 --> 02:56:02,890
"What are you going to do?"

2616
02:56:02,890 --> 02:56:10,190
"I," said Buck Kendall, suddenly savage, "am
going to consign all the math machines in

2617
02:56:10,190 --> 02:56:16,040
the universe to eternal damnation—and go
ahead and build a machine anyway.

2618
02:56:16,040 --> 02:56:18,650
I know that thing ought to be right.

2619
02:56:18,650 --> 02:56:20,620
The math's wrong."

2620
02:56:20,620 --> 02:56:23,580
"There is no other thing to try?"

2621
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:25,390
"A billion others.

2622
02:56:25,390 --> 02:56:27,030
I don't know how many others.

2623
02:56:27,030 --> 02:56:29,930
We ought to get atomic energy somehow.

2624
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:33,020
But that thing infuriates me.

2625
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:38,180
A hundred things that math has predicted,
that I have checked by experiment, simple

2626
02:56:38,180 --> 02:56:39,500
little things.

2627
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:44,850
But—when I carry it through to the point
where I can get something useful—it wriggles

2628
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:47,040
off into—uncertainty."

2629
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:50,380
Kendall stalked off to the laboratory.

2630
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:55,720
Devin was there working over the calculus
machines, and Kendall called him angrily.

2631
02:56:55,720 --> 02:57:00,029
Then more apologetic, he explained it was
anger at himself.

2632
02:57:00,029 --> 02:57:04,479
"Devin, I'm going to make that thing, if it
blows up and kills me.

2633
02:57:04,479 --> 02:57:09,260
I'm going to make that thing if this whole
fort blows up and kills me.

2634
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:14,859
That math has blown up in my face for four
solid months, and half killed me, so I'm going

2635
02:57:14,859 --> 02:57:15,859
to kill it.

2636
02:57:15,859 --> 02:57:18,390
Come on, we'll make that damned junk."

2637
02:57:18,390 --> 02:57:24,680
Angrily, furiously, Kendall drove his helpers
to the task.

2638
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:29,580
He had worked out the apparatus in plan a
dozen times, and now he had the plans turned

2639
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:33,030
into patterns, the patterns into metal.

2640
02:57:33,030 --> 02:57:38,800
Saucily, the "S Doradus" made the trip to
and from Earth with patterns, and with metal,

2641
02:57:38,800 --> 02:57:41,490
with supplies and with apparatus.

2642
02:57:41,490 --> 02:57:45,320
But she had to dodge and fight every inch
of the way as the Miran ships swooped down

2643
02:57:45,320 --> 02:57:47,399
angrily at her.

2644
02:57:47,399 --> 02:57:51,970
A fighting craft could get through when the
Miran fleet was withdrawn to some distance,

2645
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:56,920
but the Mirans were careful that no heavy-loaded
freighter bearing power supply should get

2646
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:58,790
through.

2647
02:57:58,790 --> 02:58:04,930
And Gresth Gkae waited off Luna in his great
ship, and watched the steady streams of magnetic

2648
02:58:04,930 --> 02:58:09,490
bombs exploding on the magnetic shield of
the Lunar Fort.

2649
02:58:09,490 --> 02:58:14,771
Presently more ships came up, and added their
power to the attack, for here, the photo-cell

2650
02:58:14,771 --> 02:58:19,819
banks could gather tremendous energy, and
Gresth Gkae knew he would need to overcome

2651
02:58:19,819 --> 02:58:22,390
this, and drain the accumulated power.

2652
02:58:22,390 --> 02:58:28,871
Gresth Gkae felt certain if he could once
crack this nut, break down Earth, he would

2653
02:58:28,871 --> 02:58:30,620
have the system.

2654
02:58:30,620 --> 02:58:31,880
This was the home planet.

2655
02:58:31,880 --> 02:58:37,720
If this fell, then the two others would follow
easily, despite the fact that the few forts

2656
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:42,560
on the innermost planet, Mercury, could gather
energy from the sun at a rate greater than

2657
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:44,529
their ships could generate.

2658
02:58:44,529 --> 02:58:49,720
It took Kendall two weeks and three days to
set up his preliminary apparatus.

2659
02:58:49,720 --> 02:58:55,150
They had power for perhaps four days more,
thanks to the fact that the long Lunar day

2660
02:58:55,150 --> 02:59:00,050
had begun shortly after Gresth Gkae's impatient
attack had started.

2661
02:59:00,050 --> 02:59:06,430
Also, the "S Doradus" had brought in several
hundred tons of charged mercury on each trip,

2662
02:59:06,430 --> 02:59:11,899
though this was no great quantity individually,
it had mounted up in the ten trips she had

2663
02:59:11,899 --> 02:59:13,239
made.

2664
02:59:13,239 --> 02:59:19,460
The "Cepheid," her sister ship, had gone along
on seven of the trips, and added to the total.

2665
02:59:19,460 --> 02:59:22,360
But at length the apparatus was set up.

2666
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:27,940
It was peculiar looking, and it employed a
great deal of power, nearly as much as a UV

2667
02:59:27,940 --> 02:59:29,370
beam in fact.

2668
02:59:29,370 --> 02:59:35,210
McLaurin looked at it sceptically toward the
last, and asked Buck: "What do you expect

2669
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:36,689
it to do?"

2670
02:59:36,689 --> 02:59:42,270
"I am," said Kendall sourly, "uncertain.

2671
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:45,170
The result will be uncertainty itself."

2672
02:59:45,170 --> 02:59:51,530
Which, considering things, was a surprisingly
accurate statement.

2673
02:59:51,530 --> 02:59:53,630
Kendall gave the exact answer.

2674
02:59:53,630 --> 02:59:56,699
He meant to give an ironic comment.

2675
02:59:56,699 --> 03:00:03,319
For the mathematics had been perfectly correct,
only Buck Kendall misinterpreted the answer.

2676
03:00:03,319 --> 03:00:08,910
"I've followed the math with mechanism all
the way through," he explained, "and I'm putting

2677
03:00:08,910 --> 03:00:10,170
power into it.

2678
03:00:10,170 --> 03:00:11,390
That's all I know.

2679
03:00:11,390 --> 03:00:17,470
Somewhere, by the laws of cause and effect,
this power must show itself again—despite

2680
03:00:17,470 --> 03:00:20,310
what the damn math says."

2681
03:00:20,310 --> 03:00:22,149
And in that, of course, Kendall was wrong.

2682
03:00:22,149 --> 03:00:27,570
Because the laws of cause and effect didn't
hold in what he was doing now.

2683
03:00:27,570 --> 03:00:30,529
"Do you want to watch?" he asked at length.

2684
03:00:30,529 --> 03:00:32,430
"I'm all set to try it."

2685
03:00:32,430 --> 03:00:34,609
"I suppose I may as well."

2686
03:00:34,609 --> 03:00:35,770
McLaurin smiled.

2687
03:00:35,770 --> 03:00:40,149
"In our close-knit little community the fate
of one is of interest to all.

2688
03:00:40,149 --> 03:00:46,489
If it's going to blow up, I might as well
be here, and if it isn't, I want to be."

2689
03:00:46,489 --> 03:00:51,380
Kendall smiled appreciatively and replied:
"Let it be on thy own head.

2690
03:00:51,380 --> 03:00:52,689
Here she goes."

2691
03:00:52,689 --> 03:00:56,470
He walked over to the power board, and took
command.

2692
03:00:56,470 --> 03:01:01,380
Devin, and a squad of other scientists were
seated about the room with every conceivable

2693
03:01:01,380 --> 03:01:03,820
type and combination of apparatus.

2694
03:01:03,820 --> 03:01:06,800
Kendall wanted to see what this was doing.

2695
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:08,420
"Tubes," he called.

2696
03:01:08,420 --> 03:01:11,040
"Circuits A and D. Tie-ins."

2697
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:14,340
He stopped, the preliminary switches in.

2698
03:01:14,340 --> 03:01:16,920
"Main circuit coming."

2699
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:20,569
With a jerk he threw over the last contact.

2700
03:01:20,569 --> 03:01:23,550
A heavy relay thudded solidly.

2701
03:01:23,550 --> 03:01:25,990
The hum of a straining atostor.

2702
03:01:25,990 --> 03:01:27,319
Then—

2703
03:01:27,319 --> 03:01:31,800
An electric motor, humming smoothly stopped
with a jerk.

2704
03:01:31,800 --> 03:01:42,479
"This," it remarked in a deep throaty voice,
"is probably the last stand of humanity."

2705
03:01:42,479 --> 03:01:46,600
The galvanometer before which Devin was seated
apparently agreed.

2706
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:52,859
In a rather high pitched voice it pointed
out that: "If the Lunar Fort falls, the Earth—"

2707
03:01:52,859 --> 03:01:58,930
It stopped abruptly, and an electroscope beside
Douglass took up the thread in a high, shrill

2708
03:01:58,930 --> 03:02:02,800
voice, rather slurred, "—will be directly
attacked."

2709
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:11,449
"This," resumed the motor in a hoarse voice,
"will certainly mean the end of humanity."

2710
03:02:11,449 --> 03:02:17,029
The motor gave up the discourse and hummed
violently into action—in reverse!

2711
03:02:17,029 --> 03:02:19,600
"My God!"

2712
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:23,640
Kendall pulled the switch open with a sagging
jaw and staring eyes.

2713
03:02:23,640 --> 03:02:29,700
The men in the room burst into sudden startled
exclamations.

2714
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:31,470
Kendall didn't give them time.

2715
03:02:31,470 --> 03:02:37,820
His jaw snapped shut, and a blazing light
of wondrous joy shone in his eyes.

2716
03:02:37,820 --> 03:02:41,410
He instantly threw the switch in again.

2717
03:02:41,410 --> 03:02:46,210
Again the humming atostor, the strain—

2718
03:02:46,210 --> 03:02:48,170
Slowly Devin lifted from his seat.

2719
03:02:48,170 --> 03:02:55,439
With thrashing arms and startled, staring
eyes, he drifted gently across the room.

2720
03:02:55,439 --> 03:02:59,410
Abruptly he fell to the floor, unhurt by the
light Lunar gravity.

2721
03:02:59,410 --> 03:03:08,550
"I advise," said the motor in its grumbling
voice, "an immediate exodus."

2722
03:03:08,550 --> 03:03:12,560
It stopped speaking, and practiced what it
preached.

2723
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:19,330
It was a fifty-horse motor-generator, on a
five-ton tungsten-beryllium base, but it rose

2724
03:03:19,330 --> 03:03:25,850
abruptly, spun rapidly about an axis at right
angles to the axis of its armature, and stopped

2725
03:03:25,850 --> 03:03:27,739
as suddenly.

2726
03:03:27,739 --> 03:03:31,660
In mid air it continued its interrupted lecture.

2727
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:36,000
"Mercury therefore is the destination I would
advise.

2728
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:42,220
There power is sufficient for—all machines."

2729
03:03:42,220 --> 03:03:47,140
Gently it inverted itself and settled to the
middle of the floor.

2730
03:03:47,140 --> 03:03:49,040
Kendall instantly cut the switch.

2731
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:51,850
The relay did not chunk open.

2732
03:03:51,850 --> 03:03:54,790
It refused to obey.

2733
03:03:54,790 --> 03:04:00,439
Settled in the middle of the floor now, torn
loose from its power leads, the motor-generator

2734
03:04:00,439 --> 03:04:01,790
began turning.

2735
03:04:01,790 --> 03:04:04,979
It turned faster and faster.

2736
03:04:04,979 --> 03:04:11,149
It was shrilling in a thin scream of terrific
speed, a speed that should have torn its windings

2737
03:04:11,149 --> 03:04:15,290
to fragments under the lash of centrifugal
force.

2738
03:04:15,290 --> 03:04:16,771
Contentedly it said throatily.

2739
03:04:16,771 --> 03:04:17,771
"Settled."

2740
03:04:17,771 --> 03:04:25,060
The galvanometer spoke again in its peculiar
harsh voice.

2741
03:04:25,060 --> 03:04:27,319
"Therefore, move."

2742
03:04:27,319 --> 03:04:32,120
Abruptly, without apparent reason, the stubborn
relay clicked open.

2743
03:04:32,120 --> 03:04:39,310
The shrilly screaming motor stopped dead instantly,
as though it had had no real momentum, or

2744
03:04:39,310 --> 03:04:41,239
had been inertialess.

2745
03:04:41,239 --> 03:04:45,220
Startled, white-faced men looked at Kendall.

2746
03:04:45,220 --> 03:04:49,490
Buck's eyes were shining with an unholy glee.

2747
03:04:49,490 --> 03:04:51,279
"Uncertainty!"

2748
03:04:51,279 --> 03:04:53,359
he shouted.

2749
03:04:53,359 --> 03:04:56,060
"Uncertainty—uncertainty—uncertainty,
you fools!

2750
03:04:56,060 --> 03:04:57,149
Don't you see it?

2751
03:04:57,149 --> 03:05:04,520
All the math—it said uncertainty—man,
man—we've got just that—uncertainty!"

2752
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:07,779
"You're crazy," gasped McLaurin.

2753
03:05:07,779 --> 03:05:12,819
"I'm crazy, everything's gone crazy."

2754
03:05:12,819 --> 03:05:16,420
Kendall roared with sudden, joyous laughter.

2755
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:17,420
"Absolutely.

2756
03:05:17,420 --> 03:05:21,939
Everything goes crazy—the laws of nature
break down!

2757
03:05:21,939 --> 03:05:27,410
Heisenberg's principle showed that the law
of cause and effect weren't absolute.

2758
03:05:27,410 --> 03:05:30,810
We've made them absolutely uncertain!"

2759
03:05:30,810 --> 03:05:36,430
"But—but motors talking, instruments giving
lectures—"

2760
03:05:36,430 --> 03:05:42,300
"Certainly—or rather uncertainly—anything,
absolutely anything.

2761
03:05:42,300 --> 03:05:48,190
The destruction of the laws of gravity, freedom
from inertia—why, merely picking up a radio

2762
03:05:48,190 --> 03:05:50,290
lecture is nothing!"

2763
03:05:50,290 --> 03:05:55,279
Suddenly, abruptly, a thousand questions poured
in on him.

2764
03:05:55,279 --> 03:06:00,790
Jubilantly he answered what he could, told
what he thought—and then brought order.

2765
03:06:00,790 --> 03:06:05,790
"The battle's still on, men—we've still
got to find out how to use this, now we've

2766
03:06:05,790 --> 03:06:06,790
got it.

2767
03:06:06,790 --> 03:06:09,729
I have an idea—that there's a lot more.

2768
03:06:09,729 --> 03:06:12,020
I know what I'll get this time.

2769
03:06:12,020 --> 03:06:16,189
Now help me remake this apparatus so we don't
broadcast the thing."

2770
03:06:16,189 --> 03:06:21,890
At once, ten times the former pace, work was
done.

2771
03:06:21,890 --> 03:06:26,270
On the radio, news was sent out that Kendall
was on the right track after all.

2772
03:06:26,270 --> 03:06:32,850
In two hours the apparatus had been vastly
altered, it was in the final stage, and an

2773
03:06:32,850 --> 03:06:34,920
entirely different sort of field set up.

2774
03:06:34,920 --> 03:06:38,989
Again they watched as Buck applied the power.

2775
03:06:38,989 --> 03:06:44,779
The atostor hummed—but no strange tricks
of matter happened this time.

2776
03:06:44,779 --> 03:06:50,180
The more concentrated, altered field was,
as Buck was to find out later, "Uncertainty

2777
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:51,680
of the Second Degree."

2778
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:55,340
It was molecular uncertainty.

2779
03:06:55,340 --> 03:07:00,721
In a field a foot and a half in diameter,
Buck saw the thing created—and suddenly

2780
03:07:00,721 --> 03:07:07,130
a brilliant green-blue flame shot up, and
a great dark cloud of terrible, red-brown

2781
03:07:07,130 --> 03:07:08,130
deadly vapor.

2782
03:07:08,130 --> 03:07:11,920
Then an instant later, Kendall had opened
the relay.

2783
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:16,021
Gasping, the men ran from the laboratory,
shutting the deadly fumes in.

2784
03:07:16,021 --> 03:07:21,229
"N2O4" gasped Morton, the chemist, as they
reached safety.

2785
03:07:21,229 --> 03:07:24,149
"It's exothermic—but it formed there!"

2786
03:07:24,149 --> 03:07:30,760
In that instant, Kendall grasped the meaning
the choking fumes carried.

2787
03:07:30,760 --> 03:07:33,950
"Molecular uncertainty!" he decided.

2788
03:07:33,950 --> 03:07:37,670
"We're going back—we're getting there—"

2789
03:07:37,670 --> 03:07:43,870
He altered the apparatus again, added another
atostor in series, reduced the size of his

2790
03:07:43,870 --> 03:07:47,930
sphere of forces—of strange chaos of uncertainty.

2791
03:07:47,930 --> 03:07:50,770
Within—little was certain.

2792
03:07:50,770 --> 03:07:54,570
Without—the laws of nature applied as ever.

2793
03:07:54,570 --> 03:07:59,189
Again the apparatus was started, cautiously
this time.

2794
03:07:59,189 --> 03:08:05,069
Only a strange jumbled ionization appeared
this time, then a slow, rising blue flame

2795
03:08:05,069 --> 03:08:09,310
began to creep up, and burn hot and blue.

2796
03:08:09,310 --> 03:08:15,090
Buck looked at it for a moment, then his face
grew tense and thoughtful.

2797
03:08:15,090 --> 03:08:16,090
"Devin—give me a half-dollar."

2798
03:08:16,090 --> 03:08:22,000
Blankly, Devin reached in his pocket, and
handed over the metal disc.

2799
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:26,199
Cautiously Buck Kendall tossed it toward the
sphere of force.

2800
03:08:26,199 --> 03:08:28,980
Instantly there was a flash of flame, soundless
and soft-colored.

2801
03:08:28,980 --> 03:08:36,510
Then the silver disc was outlined in light,
and swiftly, inevitably crumbling into dust

2802
03:08:36,510 --> 03:08:40,449
so fine only a blue haze appeared.

2803
03:08:40,449 --> 03:08:43,771
In less than two seconds, the metal was gone.

2804
03:08:43,771 --> 03:08:46,620
Only the dense blue fog remained.

2805
03:08:46,620 --> 03:08:51,740
Then this began to go, and the leaping blue
flame grew taller, and stronger.

2806
03:08:51,740 --> 03:08:55,609
"We're on the track—I'm going to stop here,
and calculate.

2807
03:08:55,609 --> 03:08:57,449
Bring the data—"

2808
03:08:57,449 --> 03:09:01,180
Kendall shut off the machine, and went to
the calculation room.

2809
03:09:01,180 --> 03:09:05,710
Swiftly he selected already prepared graphs,
graphs of the math he had worked on.

2810
03:09:05,710 --> 03:09:08,100
Devin came soon, and others.

2811
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:13,910
They assembled the data and with tables and
arithmetical machines turned it into graphs.

2812
03:09:13,910 --> 03:09:16,660
Then all these graphs were fed into the machine.

2813
03:09:16,660 --> 03:09:21,880
There were curves, and sine-curves, abrupt
breaking lines—but the answer that came

2814
03:09:21,880 --> 03:09:27,739
when all were compounded was a perfect diagram
of a flight of four steps, descending in unequal

2815
03:09:27,739 --> 03:09:31,260
treads to zero.

2816
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:33,529
Kendall looked at it for long minutes.

2817
03:09:33,529 --> 03:09:37,510
"That," he said at length, "is what I expected.

2818
03:09:37,510 --> 03:09:43,530
There are four degrees of uncertainty, we
generated 'Uncertainty of the First Degree,'

2819
03:09:43,530 --> 03:09:46,050
'Mass Uncertainty,' when we started.

2820
03:09:46,050 --> 03:09:49,260
That, as here shown, takes little energy concentration.

2821
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:54,840
Then we increased the energy concentration
and got 'Uncertainty of the Second Degree,'

2822
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:55,949
'Molecular Uncertainty.'

2823
03:09:55,949 --> 03:10:03,000
Then I added more power, and reduced the field,
and got 'Uncertainty of the Third Degree'—'Atomic

2824
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:04,790
Uncertainty.'

2825
03:10:04,790 --> 03:10:07,529
There is 'Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree.'

2826
03:10:07,529 --> 03:10:10,750
It is barely attainable with our atostors.

2827
03:10:10,750 --> 03:10:13,070
It is—utter uncertainty.

2828
03:10:13,070 --> 03:10:20,351
"In the First Degree, the laws of mass action
fail, the great broad-reaching laws.

2829
03:10:20,351 --> 03:10:25,609
In the Second Degree, the laws of the molecules,
a finer organization, break down, and anything

2830
03:10:25,609 --> 03:10:28,220
can happen in chemistry.

2831
03:10:28,220 --> 03:10:32,409
In the Third Degree, the laws of atomic physics
break down slowly.

2832
03:10:32,409 --> 03:10:33,420
The atom is tough.

2833
03:10:33,420 --> 03:10:39,970
It is very compact, and we just barely attained
the concentration needed with that apparatus.

2834
03:10:39,970 --> 03:10:46,430
But—in the Third Degree, when the Atomic
Laws break down into utter uncertainty, the

2835
03:10:46,430 --> 03:10:50,050
atoms break, and only hydrogen can exist.

2836
03:10:50,050 --> 03:10:51,659
That was the blue flame.

2837
03:10:51,659 --> 03:11:01,159
"But the Fourth Degree—there is no law whatsoever,
nothing in all the Universe can exist.

2838
03:11:01,159 --> 03:11:07,040
It means—the utter destruction and release
of the energy of matter!"

2839
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:08,850
Kendall paused for a moment.

2840
03:11:08,850 --> 03:11:11,609
"We have won, with this.

2841
03:11:11,609 --> 03:11:17,090
We need only make up this apparatus—and
maybe make it into a weapon.

2842
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:22,210
You know, in the Fourth Degree, nothing in
all the Universe could resist, deflect, or

2843
03:11:22,210 --> 03:11:25,030
control it, if launched freely, and self-maintaining.

2844
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:27,760
I think that might be done.

2845
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:33,050
You see, no law affects it, for it breaks
down the law.

2846
03:11:33,050 --> 03:11:38,000
Magnetism cannot attract or repel it because
magnetic fields cannot exist; there is no

2847
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:41,090
law of magnetic force, where this field is.

2848
03:11:41,090 --> 03:11:46,800
"And you know, Devin, how I have analyzed
and duplicated their magnetic ball-fields.

2849
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:49,650
This should be capable of formation into a
ball-field.

2850
03:11:49,650 --> 03:11:53,410
"We need only make it up now.

2851
03:11:53,410 --> 03:11:58,739
We will install it in the 'S Doradus' and
the 'Cepheid' as a weapon.

2852
03:11:58,739 --> 03:12:05,680
We need only install it as an energy source
here.

2853
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:19,260
Let us start."

2854
03:12:19,260 --> 03:12:26,410
XII
Buck Kendall with a slow smile, looked out

2855
03:12:26,410 --> 03:12:29,100
of the port in the thick metal wall.

2856
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:34,949
The magnetic shield of the Lunar Fort was
washed constantly with the fires of exploding

2857
03:12:34,949 --> 03:12:37,080
magnetic bombs.

2858
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:39,029
The smile spread broader.

2859
03:12:39,029 --> 03:12:47,319
"My friends," he said softly, "you can pull
from now till doomsday as far as I'm concerned,

2860
03:12:47,319 --> 03:12:51,050
and you won't even disturb us now."

2861
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:54,090
He looked back over his shoulder into the
power room.

2862
03:12:54,090 --> 03:12:59,670
A hunched bulk, beautifully designed and carefully
finished, the apparatus that created 'Uncertainty

2863
03:12:59,670 --> 03:13:06,330
of the Fourth Degree' was destroying matter,
and creating by its destruction terrific electric

2864
03:13:06,330 --> 03:13:07,330
fields.

2865
03:13:07,330 --> 03:13:10,840
These fields were feeding the magnetic shield
now.

2866
03:13:10,840 --> 03:13:14,170
Under the present drain, the machine was not
noticeably working.

2867
03:13:14,170 --> 03:13:17,280
In fact, Kendall was a bit annoyed.

2868
03:13:17,280 --> 03:13:22,870
He had tested out the energy generating properties
of this machine, trying to find a limit.

2869
03:13:22,870 --> 03:13:25,439
He had found there was no limit.

2870
03:13:25,439 --> 03:13:30,529
The great copper conductors, charged with
the same atostor force that was used in the

2871
03:13:30,529 --> 03:13:34,870
mercury fuel, were perfect conductors, they
had not heated.

2872
03:13:34,870 --> 03:13:39,479
But the eleven thousand tons of discharged
mercury metal had been completely charged

2873
03:13:39,479 --> 03:13:43,390
in just a bit better than eleven minutes.

2874
03:13:43,390 --> 03:13:48,520
The pumps wouldn't force it through the charging
apparatus any faster than that.

2875
03:13:48,520 --> 03:13:53,640
Two weeks more had passed, while the "S Doradus"
and the "Cepheid" were fitted out with the

2876
03:13:53,640 --> 03:13:55,960
new apparatus Buck had designed.

2877
03:13:55,960 --> 03:13:59,870
They were almost ready to start now.

2878
03:13:59,870 --> 03:14:03,310
McLaurin came down the corridor, and stopped
near Kendall.

2879
03:14:03,310 --> 03:14:05,640
He too smiled at the Miran's attempts.

2880
03:14:05,640 --> 03:14:08,760
"They've got a long way to go, Buck."

2881
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:11,310
"They're going a long way.

2882
03:14:11,310 --> 03:14:14,680
Clear back home—and we'll be right along.

2883
03:14:14,680 --> 03:14:17,270
I don't think they can outdistance us."

2884
03:14:17,270 --> 03:14:22,250
"I still don't see why you couldn't use one
of those Uncertainty conditions—the First

2885
03:14:22,250 --> 03:14:24,400
Degree perhaps, and annihilate our inertia."

2886
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:28,270
"You can't control Uncertainty.

2887
03:14:28,270 --> 03:14:31,580
By its essential character it's beyond control."

2888
03:14:31,580 --> 03:14:37,021
"What's that Fourth Degree machine of yours—the
material energy—if it isn't controlled and

2889
03:14:37,021 --> 03:14:39,010
utilized Uncertainty?"

2890
03:14:39,010 --> 03:14:42,479
"It's utter and utterly uncontrolled Uncertainty.

2891
03:14:42,479 --> 03:14:47,040
The matter within that field breaks down to
absolutely nothing.

2892
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:54,840
Within, no law whatsoever applies, but fortunately,
outside the old laws of physics apply—and

2893
03:14:54,840 --> 03:14:59,689
we can gather and use the energy which is
released outside, though nothing can be done

2894
03:14:59,689 --> 03:15:00,689
inside.

2895
03:15:00,689 --> 03:15:07,830
Why, think, man, if I could control that Uncertainty,
I could do anything at all, absolutely anything.

2896
03:15:07,830 --> 03:15:12,540
It would be a world as unreasonable as a bad
dream.

2897
03:15:12,540 --> 03:15:17,029
Think how unreasonable those manifestations
we first got were!"

2898
03:15:17,029 --> 03:15:20,870
"But can't you get any control at all?"

2899
03:15:20,870 --> 03:15:22,350
"Very little.

2900
03:15:22,350 --> 03:15:27,189
Anyway, if I could get inertialess conditions
at will, I'd be afraid of them.

2901
03:15:27,189 --> 03:15:32,540
They'd make chemical reactions impossible
in all probability—and life is chemical.

2902
03:15:32,540 --> 03:15:38,390
Two atoms must come into more or less violent
contact before a union takes place, and cannot

2903
03:15:38,390 --> 03:15:40,960
if they have neither momentum nor inertia.

2904
03:15:40,960 --> 03:15:43,020
"Anyway—why worry.

2905
03:15:43,020 --> 03:15:46,080
I can't do it, because I can't control this
thing.

2906
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:48,530
And we have the extra-space drive."

2907
03:15:48,530 --> 03:15:51,870
"How does that darned thing work?

2908
03:15:51,870 --> 03:15:55,040
Can't you drop the math and tell me about
it?"

2909
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:56,040
Kendall smiled.

2910
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:57,920
"Not too readily.

2911
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:03,100
Remember first, as to the driving system,
that it works on the fabric of space.

2912
03:16:03,100 --> 03:16:09,120
Space is, in the physical sense, a fabric
woven of the threads of lines of force from

2913
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:13,279
every body in the universe, made up of fields
and forces.

2914
03:16:13,279 --> 03:16:17,640
It is elastic, and can transmit strains.

2915
03:16:17,640 --> 03:16:22,010
But anything that can transmit strains, can
be strained against.

2916
03:16:22,010 --> 03:16:28,020
With the tremendous field intensities available
by the material engines, I can get such fields

2917
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:31,229
as will 'dig their toes' into space and push.

2918
03:16:31,229 --> 03:16:34,140
"That's the drive itself.

2919
03:16:34,140 --> 03:16:39,360
It is accelerationless, because it enfolds
us, and acts equally on every atom of us.

2920
03:16:39,360 --> 03:16:45,029
By maintaining in addition a slight artificial
gravity—thanks also to the intensity of

2921
03:16:45,029 --> 03:16:51,340
those material engine fields—we can be comfortable,
while we accelerate at tremendous rates.

2922
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:56,189
"That is, I think, at least allied to the
Stranger's system.

2923
03:16:56,189 --> 03:17:01,020
For the high-speed drive, I do in fact use
the Uncertainty.

2924
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:07,300
I can control it in a certain sense by determining
its powers, and the limits of uncertainty,

2925
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:09,910
whether First, Second, Third or Fourth Degree.

2926
03:17:09,910 --> 03:17:16,560
It advances in jumps—but on a finer plotting
of the curve, you can see that each jump represents

2927
03:17:16,560 --> 03:17:19,229
a vast series of smaller jumps.

2928
03:17:19,229 --> 03:17:24,699
That is, there is Class A, B, C, D, and so
forth Uncertainty of the First Degree.

2929
03:17:24,699 --> 03:17:30,760
Now Class A First Degree Uncertainty involves
only the deepest, broadest principles.

2930
03:17:30,760 --> 03:17:32,949
Only they break down.

2931
03:17:32,949 --> 03:17:36,040
One of these is the law of the speed of light.

2932
03:17:36,040 --> 03:17:40,659
"I'm sure that isn't the system the Strangers
use, but I'm also sure there's no limit to

2933
03:17:40,659 --> 03:17:42,380
the speed we can get."

2934
03:17:42,380 --> 03:17:45,439
"Doesn't that wreck your drive system?"

2935
03:17:45,439 --> 03:17:50,540
"No, because gravity and the fields I use
in driving are First Degree Uncertainties

2936
03:17:50,540 --> 03:17:51,680
of the higher classes.

2937
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:54,550
"But at any rate, it will work.

2938
03:17:54,550 --> 03:17:57,239
And—I suspect you came to say you were ready
to go."

2939
03:17:57,239 --> 03:17:58,760
"I did."

2940
03:17:58,760 --> 03:18:00,290
McLaurin nodded.

2941
03:18:00,290 --> 03:18:02,790
"Still stick to your original plan?"

2942
03:18:02,790 --> 03:18:04,130
McLaurin nodded.

2943
03:18:04,130 --> 03:18:06,370
"I think it's best.

2944
03:18:06,370 --> 03:18:10,880
You follow those fellows back to their system
in the 'S Doradus' and I'll stay here in the

2945
03:18:10,880 --> 03:18:12,600
'Cepheid' to protect the system.

2946
03:18:12,600 --> 03:18:15,430
They may need some time to get out of the
place here.

2947
03:18:15,430 --> 03:18:19,090
And remember, we ought to be as decent as
they were.

2948
03:18:19,090 --> 03:18:23,620
They didn't bother the transports leaving
Jupiter when they came in, only attacked the

2949
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:24,620
warships.

2950
03:18:24,620 --> 03:18:29,529
We're bound to do the same, but we'll have
to keep a watch on them, nonetheless.

2951
03:18:29,529 --> 03:18:31,540
So you go on ahead."

2952
03:18:31,540 --> 03:18:36,710
They started down the corridor, and came presently
to the huge locks where the "S Doradus" and

2953
03:18:36,710 --> 03:18:39,029
the "Cepheid" were berthed.

2954
03:18:39,029 --> 03:18:45,490
The super-ships lay cold and gray now, men
swarming in and out with last-minute supplies.

2955
03:18:45,490 --> 03:18:49,460
Air, water, spare parts, bedding and personal
equipment.

2956
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:54,430
Douglass, Cole, and most of the laboratory
staff would go with Kendall when he followed

2957
03:18:54,430 --> 03:18:56,050
the Strangers home.

2958
03:18:56,050 --> 03:19:02,979
Devin and a few of the most advanced physicists
would stay with McLaurin in case of need.

2959
03:19:02,979 --> 03:19:09,130
An hour later the "S Doradus" rose gently,
soundlessly from her berth, and floated out

2960
03:19:09,130 --> 03:19:10,130
of the open lock-door.

2961
03:19:10,130 --> 03:19:14,930
The "Cepheid" followed her in five seconds.

2962
03:19:14,930 --> 03:19:20,150
Still under the great screen of the fort,
the lashing, coruscating colors of the magnetic

2963
03:19:20,150 --> 03:19:24,220
bombs and the magnetic screen flashed and
was iridescent.

2964
03:19:24,220 --> 03:19:29,550
The "S Doradus" poked her great nose gently
through the screen, and an instant later her

2965
03:19:29,550 --> 03:19:36,330
titanically powerful, material-engine effortlessly
discharged a great magnetic bomb, sent with

2966
03:19:36,330 --> 03:19:40,410
the combined power of five atomic-powered
interstellar ships.

2967
03:19:40,410 --> 03:19:46,580
The two ships separated now, the "Cepheid"
under McLaurin flashing ahead with sudden,

2968
03:19:46,580 --> 03:19:51,930
terrific acceleration toward Mars, whispering
through space at a speed that made it undetectable,

2969
03:19:51,930 --> 03:19:54,040
faster than light.

2970
03:19:54,040 --> 03:20:00,290
The "S Doradus" journeyed out leisurely toward
the fleet of forty-seven Miran ships.

2971
03:20:00,290 --> 03:20:06,100
Gresth Gkae saw the "S Doradus" and as he
watched the steady progress, felt sudden fear

2972
03:20:06,100 --> 03:20:07,779
at his heart.

2973
03:20:07,779 --> 03:20:11,239
The ship seemed so certain—

2974
03:20:11,239 --> 03:20:15,510
At a distance of thirty thousand miles, Kendall
stopped.

2975
03:20:15,510 --> 03:20:21,449
Magnetic bombs were washing his screen continuously
now, seeking to exhaust the ship as all the

2976
03:20:21,449 --> 03:20:24,550
great ships beyond poured their energy against
it.

2977
03:20:24,550 --> 03:20:30,279
A slow smile spread over Kendall's mouth as
he heard the gentle hum of the barely working

2978
03:20:30,279 --> 03:20:32,120
material-engine.

2979
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:37,880
Carefully he aligned the nose UV beam of the
"S Doradus" on the nearest of the Miran ships.

2980
03:20:37,880 --> 03:20:41,270
Then he depressed a switch.

2981
03:20:41,270 --> 03:20:45,060
There was no ion-release before the force-mirror
now.

2982
03:20:45,060 --> 03:20:50,780
Just a jet of gas whirling into a half-inch
field of "Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree."

2983
03:20:50,780 --> 03:20:56,939
The matter vanished instantly in released
energy so stupendous that the greatest previous

2984
03:20:56,939 --> 03:21:01,960
UV beams had been harmless things by comparison.

2985
03:21:01,960 --> 03:21:05,130
Material energy maintained the mirror forces.

2986
03:21:05,130 --> 03:21:08,140
Material energy gave the power that was released.

2987
03:21:08,140 --> 03:21:12,590
And only material energy could have stood
up before it.

2988
03:21:12,590 --> 03:21:20,080
Thirty thousand miles away, a Miran ship flamed
instantaneously into inconceivable incandescence,

2989
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:24,660
vanishing almost in blue-violet light of terrific
intensity.

2990
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:28,439
The ship reeled away, a half-molten wreck.

2991
03:21:28,439 --> 03:21:33,410
The beam spotted two more ships before it
winked out.

2992
03:21:33,410 --> 03:21:36,279
Then Kendall began sending bombs.

2993
03:21:36,279 --> 03:21:40,359
He moved up to within 2000 miles that his
aim might be accurate.

2994
03:21:40,359 --> 03:21:46,399
They were bombs of "Uncertainty of the Third
Degree," the Uncertainty of atomic law in

2995
03:21:46,399 --> 03:21:48,659
bomb form.

2996
03:21:48,659 --> 03:21:53,210
One hit the nose of the nearest ship, and
a sphere five feet in diameter glowed mistily

2997
03:21:53,210 --> 03:21:55,330
blue for a moment.

2998
03:21:55,330 --> 03:22:00,460
Then very easily, the matter that formed the
wall of the cruiser began to run and change,

2999
03:22:00,460 --> 03:22:05,740
and presently there was only a hole, and an
expanding cloud of gas.

3000
03:22:05,740 --> 03:22:11,280
Three more flowed toward it—and the hole
enlarged, and another hole appeared in a bulkhead

3001
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:13,850
behind.

3002
03:22:13,850 --> 03:22:15,370
Kendall made a change.

3003
03:22:15,370 --> 03:22:20,870
For the first time there came the staccato
bark of the material engine under strain,

3004
03:22:20,870 --> 03:22:26,920
as it fashioned the terrific fields of "Uncertainty
of the Ultimate Degree."

3005
03:22:26,920 --> 03:22:32,210
Abruptly they leapt out, invisible till they
entered a magnetic screen, then run over with

3006
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:38,310
opalescent light as the energy of the field
was sucked into them and released.

3007
03:22:38,310 --> 03:22:43,560
It struck the nose of a ship—a field no
larger than an apple—

3008
03:22:43,560 --> 03:22:48,750
A titanic gout of energy burst out that was
soundless in space.

3009
03:22:48,750 --> 03:22:54,380
The ship suddenly opened back, opened like
the peel of a banana, till a little nub remained

3010
03:22:54,380 --> 03:23:00,580
at the further end, and the metal flaps dropped
back across and behind it dejectedly.

3011
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:05,390
A second ship was struck, and it was struck
on one side, so that it was shattered like

3012
03:23:05,390 --> 03:23:08,630
a spent firecracker.

3013
03:23:08,630 --> 03:23:13,490
Then the Miran fleet vanished in speed.

3014
03:23:13,490 --> 03:23:14,640
Kendall followed them.

3015
03:23:14,640 --> 03:23:20,229
"I think," he said with a grin, "they tried
to use their radio beam, but it spread too

3016
03:23:20,229 --> 03:23:22,069
much to do anything at that distance.

3017
03:23:22,069 --> 03:23:26,350
And they used their rotating magnetic field,
which we couldn't feel.

3018
03:23:26,350 --> 03:23:28,490
And their crumbler ray too, of course.

3019
03:23:28,490 --> 03:23:32,479
I wonder—are they headed only for Jupiter?

3020
03:23:32,479 --> 03:23:35,399
No—no, they've passed it!"

3021
03:23:35,399 --> 03:23:41,000
Faster than light, faster than energy could
follow through space, or Uncertainty Bombs

3022
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:44,970
pursue, the Mirans were fleeing for home.

3023
03:23:44,970 --> 03:23:49,040
They knew now that only in speed lay safety.

3024
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:53,229
Already they knew that a similar ship had
appeared off Jupiter, and, after wiping out

3025
03:23:53,229 --> 03:23:58,210
the Phobos and Mars stations with one bomb
each, had cleared the Jovian Satellites with

3026
03:23:58,210 --> 03:24:01,350
equal terrible efficiency.

3027
03:24:01,350 --> 03:24:06,290
In one of the fleeing ships was a broken,
tired old man, and his staff.

3028
03:24:06,290 --> 03:24:12,180
Gresth Gkae looked back at the blank, distorted
space behind them, at the swiftly dwindling

3029
03:24:12,180 --> 03:24:13,989
sun, and spoke.

3030
03:24:13,989 --> 03:24:16,370
"I was at fault, my friends.

3031
03:24:16,370 --> 03:24:18,200
Jarth has spoken.

3032
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:21,399
They are the stronger and the wiser race.

3033
03:24:21,399 --> 03:24:27,220
Farth Skalt has shown you—they use space
fields of intensity 100.

3034
03:24:27,220 --> 03:24:30,340
That means the energy of the ultimate destruction.

3035
03:24:30,340 --> 03:24:37,120
Jarth used us as his instrument of testing,
only to drive and stimulate that race.

3036
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:38,279
I do not—nay.

3037
03:24:38,279 --> 03:24:41,779
There is no doubt now, for look."

3038
03:24:41,779 --> 03:24:46,479
Plainly visible, rapidly overtaking them,
the "S Doradus" appeared sharp, and luminous

3039
03:24:46,479 --> 03:24:49,069
on the jet of distorted space.

3040
03:24:49,069 --> 03:24:52,109
"We cannot escape, my friends.

3041
03:24:52,109 --> 03:24:56,300
Shall we return to Sthor or remain in space,
lost?"

3042
03:24:56,300 --> 03:25:00,970
"Let us deflect our course—at least he may
not know our destination."

3043
03:25:00,970 --> 03:25:05,720
The interstellar ship turned very slightly
in her course.

3044
03:25:05,720 --> 03:25:12,950
Plainly they saw the "S Doradus" flash on,
in a straight line, headed for distant, red-glowing

3045
03:25:12,950 --> 03:25:14,029
Mira.

3046
03:25:14,029 --> 03:25:17,819
Gresth Gkae watched, and shrugged.

3047
03:25:17,819 --> 03:25:22,660
Silently he put the ship back on its course,
at its utmost speed.

3048
03:25:22,660 --> 03:25:26,340
Parallel with them, near to them, the "S Doradus"
flashed on.

3049
03:25:26,340 --> 03:25:31,260
Day after day, the two hurled through space
faster than light.

3050
03:25:31,260 --> 03:25:35,700
Gradually Mira brightened, and at last became
a disc.

3051
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:41,479
Gresth Gkae slowed his ships, and Kendall,
watching, slowed to match his speed.

3052
03:25:41,479 --> 03:25:45,870
Five billion miles from Sthor, they had reached
normal space speeds.

3053
03:25:45,870 --> 03:25:49,620
Viciously the Miran fleet attacked the lone
ship from Earth.

3054
03:25:49,620 --> 03:25:53,640
Their rays, their bombs, their every weapon
was flaming.

3055
03:25:53,640 --> 03:25:58,270
Great interstellar ships flashed suddenly
into speeds greater than that of light, seeking

3056
03:25:58,270 --> 03:26:01,800
to ram and destroy the smaller ship.

3057
03:26:01,800 --> 03:26:07,310
The "S Doradus" flashed into equal or greater
speed, and eluded them.

3058
03:26:07,310 --> 03:26:11,370
Kendall had determined now, which was the
leader's ship.

3059
03:26:11,370 --> 03:26:17,710
Gresth Gkae watched dully as his ships attempted
to destroy the single, small ship.

3060
03:26:17,710 --> 03:26:23,020
He sighed in resignation, and turned to walk
back to the chapel aboard the ship.

3061
03:26:23,020 --> 03:26:26,280
One last prayer to Jarth—

3062
03:26:26,280 --> 03:26:28,930
Gresth Gkae stopped abruptly.

3063
03:26:28,930 --> 03:26:31,410
The great ship was lurching strangely.

3064
03:26:31,410 --> 03:26:35,080
Men shouted sudden, frightened cries.

3065
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:38,510
The clanking and thud of relays sounded, the
shrill of alarms.

3066
03:26:38,510 --> 03:26:44,520
Then the alarms stopped, and suddenly the
whole great ship vibrated to an infinitely

3067
03:26:44,520 --> 03:26:48,159
deep voice speaking in perfect Sthorian.

3068
03:26:48,159 --> 03:26:54,020
The voice remarked solemnly, in great, vibrant
tones, that they would certainly receive news

3069
03:26:54,020 --> 03:26:56,660
presently from the Expeditions.

3070
03:26:56,660 --> 03:27:01,770
It went on for some seconds to discuss the
conditions as reported in the new system.

3071
03:27:01,770 --> 03:27:04,380
Then it stopped abruptly.

3072
03:27:04,380 --> 03:27:10,160
An electric motor just above Gresth Gkae's
head suddenly hummed into action without reason

3073
03:27:10,160 --> 03:27:12,540
or power connection.

3074
03:27:12,540 --> 03:27:17,979
Almost simultaneously he heard the shouts
of startled men as the great lock doors began

3075
03:27:17,979 --> 03:27:23,560
to open into space of their own accord, bulkhead
doors slipped shut as the roar of escaping

3076
03:27:23,560 --> 03:27:26,159
air echoed in the ship.

3077
03:27:26,159 --> 03:27:29,020
Then it was all over.

3078
03:27:29,020 --> 03:27:32,479
Gresth Gkae ran to the control room.

3079
03:27:32,479 --> 03:27:35,479
The Mirans there looked up at him with drawn
faces.

3080
03:27:35,479 --> 03:27:38,470
"The instruments—Gresth Gkae—the instruments.

3081
03:27:38,470 --> 03:27:47,400
The instruments read impossible things, the
motors worked without reason, the fields fluctuated—the

3082
03:27:47,400 --> 03:27:52,050
atomic engines stopped and the magnetic shield
broke down and gripped part of the ship instead!"

3083
03:27:52,050 --> 03:27:54,540
reported the bewildered pilot.

3084
03:27:54,540 --> 03:28:00,790
"I do not know—some strange weapon of—"
began the old scientist.

3085
03:28:00,790 --> 03:28:06,920
Something luminous and huge twisted suddenly
through space toward them, a bomb of "Uncertainty

3086
03:28:06,920 --> 03:28:08,229
of the First Degree."

3087
03:28:08,229 --> 03:28:13,900
It wrapped the ship silently—and again strange
things happened.

3088
03:28:13,900 --> 03:28:19,460
Abruptly the ship started whirling violently,
yet without centrifugal force.

3089
03:28:19,460 --> 03:28:24,780
The heavens wheeled crazily, and turned about
three axes simultaneously.

3090
03:28:24,780 --> 03:28:29,560
There was no gyroscopic effect to hold them!

3091
03:28:29,560 --> 03:28:31,069
Gradually the thing died out.

3092
03:28:31,069 --> 03:28:37,480
Then a great field seemed to catch the ship,
and hurl it away from its companions.

3093
03:28:37,480 --> 03:28:40,930
Abruptly the pilot applied all his power to
pull free.

3094
03:28:40,930 --> 03:28:42,199
In vain.

3095
03:28:42,199 --> 03:28:47,479
Gresth Gkae shook his head slowly, and raised
the pilot's hands from the board.

3096
03:28:47,479 --> 03:28:50,189
"Let them do as they will.

3097
03:28:50,189 --> 03:28:53,779
I think they mean us no real harm, Thart Kralt.

3098
03:28:53,779 --> 03:28:56,311
They can, we know, destroy us in an instant.

3099
03:28:56,311 --> 03:29:04,229
Perhaps he wants us to go somewhere with him"—Gresth
Gkae smiled sadly—"and anyway, we can do

3100
03:29:04,229 --> 03:29:06,189
nothing."

3101
03:29:06,189 --> 03:29:11,560
For nearly a billion miles the great ship
was hurled through space at tremendous normal-space

3102
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:12,680
velocity.

3103
03:29:12,680 --> 03:29:17,479
Then abruptly it was halted, without a sign
of strain or hurt.

3104
03:29:17,479 --> 03:29:22,520
The great twenty-foot UV beam on the nose
of the "S Doradus" broke into glowing gentle

3105
03:29:22,520 --> 03:29:23,520
red light.

3106
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:25,680
It flashed twice.

3107
03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:27,620
There was a pause.

3108
03:29:27,620 --> 03:29:29,980
Then it flashed four times.

3109
03:29:29,980 --> 03:29:31,930
A long wait.

3110
03:29:31,930 --> 03:29:36,659
Then three times, a pause and nine times.

3111
03:29:36,659 --> 03:29:38,439
A wait.

3112
03:29:38,439 --> 03:29:41,670
Four times, a pause, sixteen times.

3113
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:44,500
Then it stopped.

3114
03:29:44,500 --> 03:29:49,590
A slow smile of ineffable joy spread over
Gresth Gkae's face.

3115
03:29:49,590 --> 03:29:52,180
"Jarth Be Praised.

3116
03:29:52,180 --> 03:29:55,550
He can destroy, but does not wish to.

3117
03:29:55,550 --> 03:30:02,220
Ah, Thart Kralt, turn your spotlight toward
him, and flash it twenty-five times, for he

3118
03:30:02,220 --> 03:30:05,150
is trying to start communications with us.

3119
03:30:05,150 --> 03:30:08,470
Jarth is wise beyond all understanding.

3120
03:30:08,470 --> 03:30:12,860
They were the weaker race, and they are the
stronger.

3121
03:30:12,860 --> 03:33:13,659
But also they are the better, for they could
destroy, and they do not, but seek only 

3122
03:33:13,659 --> 03:33:24,290
to communicate."

3123
03:33:24,290 --> 03:33:32,030
- THE END -
