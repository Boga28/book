1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,969
These things happened to me nearly ten years
ago.

2
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:14,880
I lived in a city, but the city was hot in
summer.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
I wanted to see the country.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,970
I wanted to walk in the woods and see green
trees.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,759
I had a little red car and I had a map, too.

6
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:35,050
I drove all night out into the country.

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,030
I was happy in my car.

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,129
We had a very good summer that year.

9
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:47,170
The country was very pretty in the early morning.

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,180
The sun was hot, and the sky was blue.

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,420
I heard the birds in the trees.

12
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,730
And then my car stopped suddenly.

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,260
'What's wrong?'

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,480
I thought.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,800
'Oh dear, I haven't got any petrol.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,340
Now I'll have to walk.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,420
I'll have to find a town and buy some petrol.

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,659
But where am I?'

19
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,950
I looked at the map.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,590
I wasn't near a town.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,509
I was lost in the country.

22
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,430
And then I saw the girl.

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,979
She walked down the road, with flowers in
her hand.

24
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,770
She wore a long dress, and her hair was long,
too.

25
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,399
It was long and black, and it shone in the
sun.

26
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,659
She was very pretty.

27
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,140
I wanted to speak to her, so I got out of
the car.

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,080
'Hello,' I said.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,329
'I'm lost.

30
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,970
Where am I?'

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,730
She looked afraid, so I spoke quietly.

32
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:14,310
'I haven't got any petrol,' I said.

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,610
'Where can I find some?'

34
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,740
Her blue eyes looked at me, and she smiled.

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,850
'She's a very pretty girl!'

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,060
I thought.

37
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,470
'I do not know,' she said.

38
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,200
'Come with me to the village.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,190
Perhaps we can help you.'

40
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,730
I went with her happily, and we walked a long
way.

41
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,570
'There isn't a village on the map,' I thought.

42
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,270
'Perhaps it's a very small village.'

43
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:53,370
There was a village, and it was old and pretty.

44
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,690
The houses were black and white and very small.

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,580
There were a lot of animals.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,120
The girl stopped at a house and smiled at
me.

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,950
'Come in, please,' she said.

48
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,930
I went in.

49
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,160
The house was very clean, but it was strange,
too.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,560
There was a fire and some food above it.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,830
I felt hungry then.

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,230
'That's strange,' I thought.

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,090
'They cook their food over a wood fire!

54
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,040
Perhaps they have no money.'

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
I met her father and mother, and I liked them.

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,610
They were nice people, but their clothes were
strange.

57
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,580
'Sit down,' said the old man.

58
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,820
'Are you thirsty after your walk?'

59
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,300
He gave me a drink, and I said, 'Thank you.'

60
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,010
But the drink was strange, too.

61
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,430
It was dark brown and very strong.

62
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,790
I didn't understand.

63
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,320
But I was happy there.

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,510
I asked about petrol, but the old man didn't
understand.

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,950
'Petrol?' he asked.

66
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,139
'What is that?'

67
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,180
'This is strange,' I thought.

68
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,909
Then I asked, 'Do you walk everywhere?'

69
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,830
The old man smiled.

70
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,330
'Oh, no, we use horses,' he said.

71
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,560
'Horses!'

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,030
I thought.

73
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,520
'Horses are very slow.

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,300
Why don't they have cars?'

75
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,750
But I didn't say that to the old man.

76
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,129
I felt happy there.

77
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:54,150
I stayed all day, and I ate dinner with them
that evening.

78
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,270
Then the girl and I went out into the garden.

79
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,520
The girl's name was Mary.

80
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,319
'This is nice,' she said.

81
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,300
'We like having visitors.

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,419
We do not see many people here.'

83
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,520
We spoke happily.

84
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,130
She was very beautiful.

85
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,370
But after a time, she began to talk quietly,
and her face was sad.

86
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,479
'Why are you sad?'

87
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,569
I asked her.

88
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:31,129
'I cannot tell you,' she said.

89
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,520
'You are only a visitor here.

90
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,610
We have to say goodbye tonight.

91
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,560
You have to go now.'

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,849
I didn't understand.

93
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,199
I loved her.

94
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,749
I knew that.

95
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,710
And I wanted to help her.

96
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,449
Why did I have to go?

97
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:56,120
But Mary said again in a sad voice, 'You have
to go.

98
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,039
It is dangerous here.'

99
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,699
So I said, 'I'll go to the next town and find
some petrol.

100
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,389
Then I'll come back.'

101
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,139
She didn't speak.

102
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,509
'I love you, Mary,' I said.

103
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,669
'And I'll come back to you.

104
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,349
You won't stop me.'

105
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,240
She said goodbye to me at the door.

106
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,949
Her face was very sad, and I was sad, too.

107
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,840
I didn't want to go.

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,449
It was midnight.

109
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,939
The night was very dark, but I walked and
walked.

110
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,800
I was very tired when I saw the lights of
a town.

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,449
I found some petrol, and then I asked the
name of the village.

112
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,409
But the man at the garage gave me a strange
look.

113
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,249
'What village?' he asked.

114
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,650
I told him about the village.

115
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,779
I told him about the old houses and the people
with strange clothes.

116
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,250
Again he gave me a strange look.

117
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:13,340
He thought, and then he said, 'There was a
village there, but it isn't there now.

118
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,370
There are stories about it - strange stories.'

119
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,830
'What do people say about it?'

120
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,750
I asked.

121
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:30,370
He didn't want to tell me, but then he said,
'There was a big fire in the village.

122
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,389
Everybody died.

123
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,930
There aren't any people or houses there now.'

124
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,220
'How did it happen?'

125
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,220
I asked.

126
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,129
'And why?'

127
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,849
'Oliver Cromwell killed them,' he said.

128
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,080
'He was angry with the villagers because they
helped the king in the war.'

129
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,509
I couldn't speak.

130
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,479
'This isn't right,' I thought.

131
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,319
'That war happened 350 years ago!'

132
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:09,190
Then I remembered the strange clothes, the
long hair, the food over the fire, and the

133
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,680
old houses.

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,460
And I remembered, too, about the horses.

135
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,919
'But I don't understand,' I cried.

136
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,479
'I saw the people and the village.

137
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,310
I spoke to some people there!'

138
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,310
The man looked quickly at me, and then he
spoke.

139
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,840
'There's an interesting story about the village.

140
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:44,610
For one day every ten years, it lives again
- but only for one day.

141
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,570
Then it goes away again for another ten years.

142
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,320
On that one day, you can find the village.

143
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,020
But you have to leave before morning, or you
will never leave.'

144
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,470
'Can this be right?'

145
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,270
I thought.

146
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,350
Perhaps it was.

147
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,500
Mary said, 'You have to go.'

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,290
She loved me, but she said, 'We have to say
goodbye.'

149
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,880
She was afraid for me.

150
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,270
'Now I understand,' I thought.

151
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,130
I went back to the village, but it wasn't
there.

152
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,710
I looked again and again, but I couldn't find
it.

153
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,340
I saw only flowers and trees.

154
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,910
I heard only the sound of the birds and the
wind.

155
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,530
I was very sad.

156
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,450
I sat down on the ground and cried.

157
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,240
I will never forget that day.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,040
I remember Mary, and I will always love her.

159
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,200
Now, I only have to wait two months.

160
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
The village will conic back again.

161
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,140
On the right day, I will go back.

162
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,400
I will find her again, my love with the long,
black hair.

163
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,740
And this time, I will not leave before morning.

164
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
I will stay with her.

165
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:19,950
- THE END -
