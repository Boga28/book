CHAPTER ONE
I Begin My Story

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,390
My father and mother died before I was two
years old.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,940
I cannot remember them.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,910
My father died first, fighting in the war
against the French in 1815.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,490
My mother died a few months afterwards.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,900
My cousin Ambrose, who was twenty years older
than me, became my guardian.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,700
He looked after me as if I was his son.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,540
From the beginning, I loved Ambrose more than
anyone else in the world.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,590
Ambrose Ashley was a rich, unmarried man.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,969
He lived in a beautiful old house in the west
of England.

11
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,809
The house was near the sea and there was farmland
all round it.

12
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:57,719
The house, the land and the farms around it
had all belonged to the Ashley family for

13
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,789
many years.

14
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,509
The house was full of pictures, books and
many beautiful things.

15
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,899
Ambrose was a gentleman of leisure.

16
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:10,499
He was not a businessman.

17
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:15,170
But he took good care of all the people who
worked on his land.

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,240
He knew them all by name.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,310
Everyone on the estate loved Ambrose as much
as I did.

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,670
Ambrose was a shy man, with many unusual ideas.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,779
He looked after me himself and would not have
a woman in the house to help him.

22
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:37,869
But he was friendly with the people who lived
in the other big houses in the district.

23
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:42,509
Some of his neighbours did not understand
Ambrose, but they all liked him.

24
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,950
As I grew older, Ambrose and I became more
like brothers.

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,420
We were both tall, shy men, with long arms
and legs and big feet.

26
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,569
We both had thick, curly hair, although Ambrose's
hair was darker than mine.

27
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,319
We enjoyed doing the same things.

28
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,450
We often rode our horses through the beautiful
woods and fields near the house.

29
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,980
When the weather was good, we sailed our boat
on the sea, fished, or swam.

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,819
There were no female servants in the Ashley
house.

31
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,140
Ambrose said he did not want women in the
house.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,540
And as I grew older, I agreed more and more
with his ideas.

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,250
The big house was not very clean or tidy,
but it was comfortable and we both loved it.

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,159
The servants looked after us well and the
food and wine were always good.

35
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,060
Ambrose and I often sat together after dinner,
drinking wine in the light of our candles.

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,989
Then we sat in the library beside a bright
fire.

37
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,950
The walls of the library were covered with
shelves full of beautiful books.

38
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,680
On Sundays, we always went to church.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,390
After breakfast, the carriage took Ambrose
and me to the church in the village.

40
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,720
All the servants came to church too.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,799
On Sunday evenings, we had an early dinner.

42
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,760
Usually, some of our neighbours would eat
with us.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,540
When I was old enough, Ambrose taught me how
to look after his land and his people.

44
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,299
I was his heir.

45
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,569
The house and the land were going to be mine
when Ambrose died.

46
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,730
But I never thought that Ambrose would die.

47
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,230
We both expected that he would live for many
years.

48
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,269
Our days together passed in a calm happiness.

49
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,950
But sometimes changes come into people's lives
that they do not expect.

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,999
Things happen to us that we can do nothing
about.

51
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,980
My dear cousin Ambrose is dead.

52
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,329
That is why I am writing this story.

53
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,530
My cousin Rachel is dead too.

54
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,719
And who was my cousin Rachel?

55
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,300
You must read my story to find the answer
to that question.

56
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,620
I know who killed Rachel, but I do not know
how my dear Ambrose died.

57
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,410
Was he killed too?

58
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,400
I shall never be able to answer that question.

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,120
I shall never know the answer.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,720
Perhaps, you who are reading this can decide.

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,729
You must be my cousin Rachel's judge and mine
too.

62
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:38,770
I, Philip Ashley, am only twenty-five now.

63
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,560
Most of my life is in front of me.

64
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,690
But the only people I shall ever love are
dead.

65
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,270
I cannot live with my thoughts any longer.

66
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,740
I must write down everything that happened
- everything about Ambrose, my cousin Rachel

67
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:13,600
and myself.

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,120
CHAPTER TWO
Nevus From Italy

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,419
Ambrose and I lived in Cornwall.

70
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,889
It is often cold and damp in winter there.

71
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,910
Rain falls nearly every day and the sea looks
rough and grey.

72
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,099
This weather was bad for Ambrose.

73
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:39,340
By the time he was forty years old, he was
walking with a stick and his hair was turning

74
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,340
grey.

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,039
His doctors told him that he must go abroad
every winter to a drier country.

76
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,410
If he did this, he would become stronger and
he would live to be a healthy, old man.

77
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,509
I was twenty-two when Ambrose went abroad
for the third winter.

78
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:04,039
I had left University and I was old enough
to look after the estate by myself.

79
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,590
This time, Ambrose was going to Italy.

80
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,159
He wanted to see the beautiful gardens of
Rome and Florence.

81
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,960
Ambrose loved his own gardens and everything
he planted grew well there.

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,740
Now he was planning to bring back many unusual
plants and trees from Italy.

83
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,550
The evening before Ambrose left for Italy,
we sat together in the library as usual.

84
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,699
We were both smoking our pipes and our long
legs were stretched out in front of us.

85
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:39,030
We were wearing old, comfortable clothes and
the fire was burning brightly.

86
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,970
The dogs were sleeping at our feet.

87
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:49,150
We sat in silence for a while and then Ambrose
said, 'I wish you were coming with me tomorrow,

88
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,150
Philip.'

89
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,150
'Why not?'

90
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,280
I replied quickly.

91
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,190
'I could soon be ready.

92
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,970
Yes, Ambrose, let me go with you.'

93
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,509
Ambrose smiled.

94
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,439
'No,' he said.

95
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,580
'We can't both be away.

96
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,970
Someone must look after the estate.

97
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,050
Forget I asked you.'

98
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,539
'You are feeling well, aren't you?'

99
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,710
I asked.

100
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,150
'You haven't any pain?'

101
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,960
'Of course not, Philip,' Ambrose replied.

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,940
'The trouble is that I love my home too much.

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,159
I don't want to leave.'

104
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,100
Ambrose stood up and walked towards the windows.

105
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,289
He pulled back the heavy curtains and looked
out into the darkness.

106
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,370
'You must promise to look after the gardens
for me, Philip,' he said.

107
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,270
'What do you mean?'

108
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,270
I asked.

109
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,080
'You will be back here in the spring.'

110
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,270
'Yes, I will...'

111
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,879
Ambrose answered slowly.

112
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,050
'Take care of things while I'm away, Philip.

113
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,469
You are very young, but I need your help,
you know that.

114
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:00,729
And everything I have will be yours.'

115
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,720
Suddenly I felt afraid.

116
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,830
'Ambrose, please let me go to Italy with you,'
I said again.

117
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,199
'No, Philip, that's enough,' Ambrose said
with a smile.

118
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,199
'Go to bed.'

119
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,650
That was all.

120
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,349
We did not discuss the matter again.

121
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:29,030
Early the following morning, Ambrose left
for Plymouth, our nearest big port.

122
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,229
He was going by ship to the south of France.

123
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:38,730
From there, he would travel by coach to Italy.

124
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,440
The weeks passed slowly for me.

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,340
They always did when Ambrose was away.

126
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,570
But I had plenty to do.

127
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:54,010
And if I was lonely, I rode my horse into
the nearest town or visited our neighbours.

128
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,540
The first letter from Ambrose arrived in the
middle of November.

129
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,000
He was well and happy.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,210
The journey by ship had gone well.

131
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,750
At Christmas, Ambrose wrote to say that he
had reached Florence.

132
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,760
It was in this letter that he wrote about
his cousin Rachel for the first time.

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,400
He told me that our family and her family
were related.

134
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,390
Rachel's father and mother were both dead.

135
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,530
Rachel's husband, an Italian count, had died
too.

136
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:31,560
She lived alone near Florence in a big house,
called the Villa Sangalletti.

137
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,640
Rachel had planted the gardens of the villa
herself and they were famous for their beauty.

138
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,930
I was glad when I read this letter.

139
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,230
Ambrose had found a friend who loved gardens
as much as he did.

140
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,710
The winter in Europe was very bad that year
and snow covered the roads.

141
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,470
Because of this, the next letter did not arrive
until the early spring.

142
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,280
In this letter, Ambrose told me more about
his cousin Rachel.

143
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,260
She had found him somewhere to stay near her
villa.

144
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,800
My cousin Rachel is a very intelligent woman,
Ambrose wrote.

145
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,740
But, thank God, she doesn't talk too much.

146
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,090
Her gardens are beautiful.

147
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,290
The weather is getting warmer and I am spending
a lot of time in them.

148
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,160
My cousin Rachel is pleased to have an English
friend and I am giving her advice about business

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,810
matters.

150
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,570
She has very little money.

151
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,670
Because I have helped her, my cousin Rachel
has helped me find many beautiful plants.

152
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,530
I will bring them home with me.

153
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,570
I was surprised by this letter.

154
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,790
Ambrose had never shown any interest in a
woman before.

155
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,390
But I was glad that he was well and happy.

156
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:58,080
There were a few more letters, but Ambrose
did not say anything about returning to Cornwall.

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,830
Then at the end of April, I received the letter
that changed my whole life.

158
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,200
Dear boy,

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,700
I don't know how to begin to tell you - my
cousin Rachel and I were married two weeks

160
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,040
ago.

161
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,660
I do not know why she has chosen me.

162
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,160
But we are very happy together.

163
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,620
I love her, Philip, and I am sure you will
love her too.

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,110
She is kind and good.

165
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,670
Tell our friends about my marriage, Philip.

166
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,520
And remember, it will never change my feelings
for you.

167
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,690
Write soon and send some words of welcome
to your cousin Rachel.

168
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,810
I could not believe it.

169
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,510
I took the letter out in the gardens and walked
slowly down to the sea.

170
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,410
I sat there and read the letter again.

171
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,020
I felt lonely, angry and very unhappy.

172
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,650
I was already jealous of this woman, my cousin
Rachel.

173
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,420
I knew that my life would never be the same
again.

174
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,870
I told all the neighbours about Ambrose's
marriage.

175
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,690
But I did not speak to anyone about my feelings.

176
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,120
To my surprise, all our neighbours were very
happy at the news.

177
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,410
'It's the best thing that could have happened.

178
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,020
When are they coming home?'

179
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,890
people said.

180
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,810
But I did not know.

181
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:29,320
Ambrose had not written anything about when
he would come back.

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,640
Our nearest friends were Nick Kendall and
his daughter, Louise.

183
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,780
Nick Kendall was nearly sixty years old.

184
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,890
He was my godfather.

185
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,690
His wife was dead.

186
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,170
Louise was a little younger than me and people
said she was pretty.

187
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,370
We had known each other all our lives and
she was like a sister to me.

188
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,540
The Kendalls were the first people I told
about Ambrose's marriage.

189
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,830
Nick Kendall was a lawyer.

190
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,810
When he heard the news, he looked at me carefully.

191
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,220
'You will have to start looking for a house,
Philip,' he said.

192
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,010
At first I did not understand.

193
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,520
'What do you mean?'

194
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,540
I asked in surprise.

195
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,470
'Well, Ambrose and his wife will want to be
together,' Nick Kendall told me.

196
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,140
'They may have children.

197
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,000
I am sure Ambrose will buy you a house of
your own.

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,520
And you may get married yourself.

199
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,370
There are many pretty girls in the district.'

200
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,170
He went on talking, but I did not hear what
he said.

201
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,790
I had never thought I would have to leave
my home.

202
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,000
I hated my cousin Rachel.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,600
What was she like, this woman who was completely
changing my life?

204
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,160
Was she pretty or plain, old or young?

205
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,180
In the middle of May, I received another letter
from Ambrose.

206
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,640
He said that he and my cousin Rachel were
staying in Italy for the summer.

207
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,500
I was so happy.

208
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,540
Thank God, this woman was not going to come
to the house yet!

209
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,180
I began to enjoy life again.

210
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,300
The summer passed and winter came.

211
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,470
Ambrose did not return.

212
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,690
He continued to write to me but his letters
changed.

213
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,500
I began to feel that he was not happy.

214
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,310
The summer and autumn were very hot in Italy
that year.

215
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,050
Ambrose was having terrible headaches.

216
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,260
He had never had headaches before.

217
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,390
But he said nothing about coming home.

218
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,600
The second winter passed and then the spring.

219
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,990
Ambrose had been married for more than a year
now.

220
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,410
Many weeks passed and I did not receive a
letter.

221
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,630
I began to worry.

222
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,660
At last a letter came in July.

223
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,350
But it made me more worried than before.

224
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,190
I got on my horse at once and rode over to
Nick Kendall's house to show him the letter.

225
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,200
The writing was so bad that we could hardly
read it.

226
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,430
Ambrose wrote to say that he had a terrible
illness.

227
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,560
He wrote about his fear of Italian doctors
and of a man called Rainaldi.

228
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,550
He also seemed to be afraid of his wife, Rachel.

229
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,730
'These are the words of a very sick man,'
Nick Kendall said slowly.

230
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,070
'A man whose mind is very disturbed.

231
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,160
You do not know this, Philip, but Ambrose's
father died of a tumour of the brain.

232
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,130
In the last weeks of his life, he was sometimes
like a madman.

233
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,650
I hope that Ambrose...'

234
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,500
Then Nick Kendall looked at me and said, 'I
think you had better go to Italy, Philip.

235
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,250
You must find out what is happening.'

236
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,450
I knew immediately that I had to go to Italy.

237
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,530
I did not look forward to the long journey
in a strange country.

238
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:12,160
I could not speak French or Italian.

239
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,970
I went home and got ready to leave.

240
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,870
Seecombe, our head servant, was going to look
after the house while I was away.

241
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,170
I did not tell him about Ambrose's illness.

242
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,910
I was in the carriage ready to leave when
a last letter arrived from Ambrose.

243
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,370
It was very short and almost impossible to
read.

244
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,430
For God's sake, come quickly!

245
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,500
Ambrose had written.

246
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,450
Rachel, my torment, has won.

247
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,380
I am dying.

248
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,610
Come quickly, or it will be too late!

249
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,520
I began my journey with a terrible fear in
my heart.

250
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
It was the 10th of July.

251
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:13,389
I knew I could not reach Ambrose until the
middle of August.

252
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:18,649
CHAPTER THREE
The Villa Sangalletti

253
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:20,120
I had a terrible journey.

254
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,629
The roads were noisy and dirty.

255
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:26,970
The weather got hotter every day.

256
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,690
By the time I reached Florence, it was the
15th of August.

257
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,600
I found a room in a hotel and washed and changed
my clothes.

258
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,700
When I went out again, the streets were full
of people.

259
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,150
It was about four o'clock in the afternoon
and still very hot.

260
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,299
I stopped a carriage.

261
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,679
'Villa Sangalletti,' I said to the driver.

262
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,450
He nodded and pointed up the hill.

263
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,779
The horse pulled the carriage slowly up a
long, twisting road.

264
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,690
At last, the driver stopped in front of a
gate in a high wall.

265
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,300
I made signs to him to wait.

266
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,929
There was a bell beside the gate and I pulled
it hard.

267
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:12,990
I waited a few moments, but no one came.

268
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,740
I rang the bell again.

269
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,910
I heard the sounds of a dog barking and a
child crying.

270
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,220
It was very hot.

271
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,529
Then I heard footsteps and the gate slowly
opened.

272
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,350
A servant woman stood in the gateway.

273
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,360
There was a long, wide path behind her.

274
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,100
It led to the villa.

275
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,769
'Villa Sangalletti?

276
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:36,909
Signor Ashley?'

277
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,889
I asked.

278
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:42,370
The woman tried to shut the gate, but I pushed
past her.

279
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,480
A man appeared and the woman shouted to him
in Italian.

280
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,720
I heard the words: 'Ashley...

281
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,090
Inglese...'

282
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,820
The man stared at me.

283
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,779
'I speak a little English, signore,' he said.

284
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,929
'Can I help you?'

285
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,480
'I have come here to see Mr Ashley,' I said.

286
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,539
'Are Mr and Mrs Ashley at the villa?'

287
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,250
The man looked worried.

288
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,290
'Are you Signor Ashley's son, signore?' he
asked.

289
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,700
'No,' I said, 'I am his cousin.

290
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
Tell me quickly.

291
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,029
Is he at home?'

292
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,799
'You are from England, signore?'

293
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,510
the man asked slowly.

294
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,250
'You have not heard the news?

295
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,200
Signor Ashley, he died three weeks ago.

296
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,480
Very sudden.

297
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,740
After the funeral, the contessa, his wife,
shut up the villa and went away.

298
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,200
We do not know if she will come back again.'

299
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,410
I did not say anything.

300
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,029
There was nothing I could say.

301
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:55,360
'Signor,' the man said kindly, 'I will open
the villa for you.

302
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,990
You can see where Signor Ashley died.'

303
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,529
I was not interested in where I went or what
I did.

304
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:09,299
The man began to walk up the path, taking
some keys from his pocket.

305
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,299
I followed.

306
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,379
The villa was very beautiful.

307
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,500
All the windows were closed and shuttered.

308
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,130
The man opened the big door.

309
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,200
He and the woman began to open the shutters.

310
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,940
The rooms were large and the air was dry and
dusty.

311
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,750
'The Villa Sangalletti is beautiful, signore,
very old,' said the man.

312
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,880
'The Signor Ashley, this is where he sat.

313
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,039
This was his chair.'

314
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,210
I looked at the chair.

315
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,539
I could not think of Ambrose in this house,
in this room.

316
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,909
I went to the window.

317
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,690
Outside, there was a little courtyard.

318
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,430
It was open to the sky, but shaded from the
sun.

319
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,169
In the middle of the courtyard, there was
a fountain and a little pool.

320
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,960
A laburnum tree stood beside the pool.

321
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,830
Its golden flowers had died.

322
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,090
And its small, green seeds lay on the ground.

323
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,799
'Signor Ashley, he sat here every day,' the
man said.

324
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:21,059
'He liked to listen to the water falling.

325
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,730
He sat there, under the tree.

326
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,170
In summer, they always sat here, Signor Ashley
and the contessa.

327
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,820
They drank their tisana here, after dinner.

328
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,110
Day after day, always the same.'

329
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,960
It was very cool there in the courtyard and
very, very quiet.

330
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,030
I thought of how Ambrose had lived at home
- walking, riding, always cheerful and busy.

331
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:56,779
'I will show you the room where Signor Ashley
died,' the man said quietly.

332
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,799
I followed him upstairs into the plain, bare
room.

333
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,570
I looked at the small, hard bed where Ambrose
had died.

334
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,080
'He died suddenly,' the man told me.

335
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,850
'He was very weak from the fever.

336
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,450
But sometimes he shouts, like a madman.

337
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,559
Then one morning, the contessa called for
me.

338
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,220
'He was lying very still.

339
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,769
It was the sleep of death.

340
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:27,630
He had a peaceful face.

341
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,820
The pain and the madness had all gone.'

342
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,130
'Madness?

343
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,130
What do you mean?'

344
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,390
I said.

345
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,789
'The madness of the fever,' the man replied.

346
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:41,840
'He suffered much pain.

347
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,740
Sometimes, I had to hold him down in his bed.

348
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,909
Then came the fever and the madness.

349
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,919
I tell you, signore, it was terrible to see.'

350
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,639
I turned away.

351
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,659
'Why was nothing done?'

352
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,659
I said.

353
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,399
'Why did Mrs Ashley let him die?

354
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,210
What was this illness?

355
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,029
How long did it last?'

356
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:10,929
'At the end, it was very sudden, like I told
you,' said the man.

357
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,179
'But he had been very ill all winter.

358
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,210
And he was sad.

359
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,530
All winter he was sad.'

360
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,340
We walked through another room and out onto
a long terrace.

361
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,990
In front of us were the most beautiful gardens
I had ever seen.

362
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:37,909
'I think,' the man said slowly, 'that the
contessa will not come back again.

363
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,669
Too sad for her.

364
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:45,440
Signor Rainaldi told us that perhaps the villa
will be sold.'

365
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,100
'Who is Signor Rainaldi?'

366
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,919
I asked quickly.

367
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,759
'He arranges things for the contessa,' the
man replied.

368
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,019
'Money, business, everything.

369
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,899
I give you his address.

370
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,119
He speaks English very well.'

371
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,059
He closed the shutters.

372
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,529
We walked downstairs again and stood by the
big door.

373
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,039
'What happened to his clothes?'

374
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,190
I asked.

375
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,639
'Where are his books, his papers?'

376
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:20,210
'The contessa took everything with her.'

377
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,220
'And you don't know where she went?'

378
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,010
I asked.

379
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,909
The man shook his head.

380
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,730
'She has left Florence.

381
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,590
That is all I know.

382
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:38,320
Signor Ashley was buried here in Florence,
signore, then the contessa left.'

383
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,090
The woman suddenly spoke to her husband and
opened a chest near the wall.

384
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,909
She came back carrying a big straw hat - Ambrose's
hat.

385
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:51,820
The hat that he had sometimes worn at home,
in the sun.

386
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,179
The woman gave it to me and I stood there
with it in my hands.

387
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,080
'Take it with you, signore,' the man said
softly.

388
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:19,490
'It is yours now.'

389
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,679
CHAPTER FOUR
I Meet Rainaldi

390
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,059
On my journey back to Florence, I thought
of only one thing.

391
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,669
I had to speak to Signor Rainaldi.

392
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:37,870
He must know more about Ambrose's death.

393
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,000
The servant at the villa had given me Signor
Rainaldi's address.

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,110
I found the house at last, in a quiet, dark
street.

395
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,720
Signor Rainaldi was at home and a servant
took me to his room.

396
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,570
Rainaldi looked surprised when he saw me.

397
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:59,490
He was a thin man, about forty years old,
with a proud, hard face.

398
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:05,090
'My name is Ashley - Philip Ashley,' I said.

399
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,610
'Yes,' Signor Rainaldi answered.

400
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,263
'Will you sit down?

401
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:13,370
You are Ambrose Ashley's cousin - and his
heir.

402
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,929
You look very like him.

403
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,759
I did not expect to see you here.

404
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,429
When did you arrive in Florence?'

405
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,450
'This afternoon,' I replied.

406
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,619
'I have been to the Villa Sangalletti.'

407
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,269
Signor Rainaldi smiled.

408
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,379
'Then you have not seen your cousin Rachel,'
he said.

409
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:37,029
'She left Florence very suddenly.

410
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,009
Your cousin's death was a great shock to her.'

411
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:45,090
'It was a shock to me, too, Signor Rainaldi,'
I said.

412
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,379
'Why wasn't I told about Ambrose's illness?'

413
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:53,580
'Mrs Ashley always hoped he would get well,'
Rainaldi answered.

414
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,070
'She did not want to worry you.'

415
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,980
'But I had these letters,' I said.

416
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,720
'That is why I came to Florence.'

417
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,860
And I handed Rainaldi the last two letters
from Ambrose.

418
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,269
When he had read them Signor Rainaldi said
slowly, 'Yes, the doctors warned Mrs Ashley

419
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:14,269
of this.'

420
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:16,970
'What do you mean?'

421
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,499
'They told her that your cousin had a tumour
on his brain.

422
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:22,279
That is why he wrote these letters.

423
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:27,529
First the tumour destroyed his brain and then
it killed him.'

424
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,110
I shook my head.

425
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,080
I could not believe it.

426
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,539
Rainaldi held out a paper.

427
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,769
'This is a copy of the death certificate,'
he said.

428
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:42,169
'I sent another copy of it to you in Cornwall
and one to Mr Kendall.

429
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,009
As your guardian, he had to be told about
Ambrose's death.'

430
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,809
'Mr Kendall is my guardian?'

431
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,200
I asked in surprise.

432
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,809
'Ambrose never told me that.'

433
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,999
'It is in your cousin's will,' Rainaldi replied.

434
00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:01,860
'Mr Kendall will explain when you return home.'

435
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,110
'But what about these letters?'

436
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,389
I cried.

437
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:06,960
'Ambrose wrote them to warn me.

438
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,299
He was not sick, but in great danger.'

439
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:14,980
'Your Cousin Ambrose was sick in his mind,'
Rainaldi answered.

440
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,519
'His sickness gave him strange ideas.

441
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,700
Because Mrs Ashley was with him all the time,
he suspected her.

442
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,580
A sick man often thinks that his dearest friends
are his enemies.'

443
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:33,559
'If I had been here, Ambrose would be alive
now,' I said.

444
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,289
Rainaldi shook his head.

445
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,070
'No,' he said.

446
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,220
'That is not true.

447
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,990
No one could do anything for him.'

448
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,429
I turned and moved towards the door.

449
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:52,029
'When Mrs Ashley returns, tell her I know
about the letters,' I said.

450
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:56,230
'Your cousin Rachel left Florence very suddenly,'
Rainaldi said.

451
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,200
'I do not think she will come back.'

452
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,799
I walked out of the cold house and into the
dark streets.

453
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,090
I did not believe Rainaldi's story.

454
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,460
Ambrose had died in great pain and unhappiness.

455
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,399
And my cousin Rachel had been the cause of
his pain.

456
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,039
I was sure of that.

457
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:24,450
I promised myself that one day I would bring
pain and unhappiness to my cousin Rachel.

458
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,220
I would punish this woman who had killed my
dear Ambrose, far away from his home and his

459
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:47,370
friends.

460
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,169
CHAPTER FIVE
An Argument and an Arrival

461
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:58,129
I arrived home in the first week of September.

462
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,500
I had sent letters and the servants were already
dressed in black.

463
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,769
My journey to Italy seemed like a dream.

464
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:09,220
I was glad to be home.

465
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,610
I was responsible now for the house and estate.

466
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,169
I had to look after them as Ambrose had done.

467
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:19,919
I wanted to do my work well.

468
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,279
My godfather, Nick Kendall, visited me as
soon as I got back.

469
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,659
He brought his daughter, Louise, with him.

470
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,269
Nick Kendall had come to explain Ambrose's
will to me.

471
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:38,019
'The house and the estate will be yours when
you are twenty-five, Philip,' he told me.

472
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:43,570
'But for the next seven months, I am your
guardian.

473
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,830
If you want money, you must come to me.

474
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,090
Of course, I hope, one day, you will marry.

475
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,510
This place needs a woman, Philip.'

476
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,980
'I want no woman,' I said.

477
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,110
'Ambrose married, and it killed him.'

478
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:05,149
'My cousin Rachel left Florence the day after
the funeral,' I went on.

479
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:07,480
'Signor Rainaldi told me.

480
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,570
She took all Ambrose's things with her, like
a thief.'

481
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:16,279
'You must not call your cousin's wife a thief,'
Nick Kendall said.

482
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:22,669
'If Ambrose had changed his will when he married,
everything would now belong to her.

483
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:26,749
I am surprised that your cousin Rachel has
not made a claim.'

484
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,120
'A claim!'

485
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,499
I cried.

486
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:32,919
'But she was the cause of Ambrose's death!'

487
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,139
'Nonsense, Philip,' said Nick Kendall.

488
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,620
'Ambrose died of a brain tumour.

489
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,269
That is why he wrote those terrible letters.'

490
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,470
'I don't believe it,' I said.

491
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,640
'You don't want to believe it,' my godfather
replied angrily.

492
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,059
'Keep those ideas to yourself, Philip.

493
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,720
If you don't, there will be trouble.'

494
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,840
I said nothing.

495
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,730
I did not see the Kendalls again for nearly
two weeks.

496
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,390
Then Nick Kendall asked me to go and see him.

497
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,649
I found him in his study, a letter in his
hand.

498
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:19,460
'Well,' he said slowly, 'I have news for you,
Philip.

499
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,220
This is a letter from your cousin Rachel.

500
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,450
She has come to England with Ambrose's things.

501
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,700
She asks for nothing.

502
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,779
She only wants to see the house that Ambrose
lived in.

503
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:37,210
She is in a strange country, without a friend.

504
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,669
You ought to see her, Philip.'

505
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,080
I smiled.

506
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,509
'Of course I'll see my cousin Rachel,' I said
in a hard, cold voice.

507
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:50,249
'I want to see her very much.

508
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:52,090
Tell her that when you write to her.

509
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:57,740
Tell her that Philip Ashley invites his cousin
Rachel to his home.'

510
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,179
Nick Kendall understood my feelings.

511
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,239
'You have become very hard, Philip,' he said.

512
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:09,809
'I hope you will not say anything stupid when
Mrs Ashley is here.

513
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,289
She was your cousin's wife.

514
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:16,080
You must remember that.'

515
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,159
I went out into the garden and saw Louise
walking there.

516
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,460
When I told her about my cousin Rachel's visit,
she was very surprised.

517
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,649
'No woman has stayed in that house for twenty
years,' Louise said.

518
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:32,029
'Think how dusty and untidy it is!'

519
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:36,310
'It was good enough for Ambrose,' I said.

520
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,049
'She won't think about the house when I begin
to question her!

521
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:44,470
She'll cry - and I'll be pleased!'

522
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,210
But when I got home, I changed my mind.

523
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,110
I wanted to show my cousin Rachel that I was
a gentleman.

524
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:56,730
I wanted her to know that I was a man who
looked after his property.

525
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,440
I spoke to the head servant, Seecombe.

526
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,590
He agreed that the whole house must be cleaned
before Mrs Ashley arrived.

527
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,080
'We must make Mrs Ashley welcome,' Seecombe
said.

528
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,900
'Shall I prepare Mr Ambrose's room for her?'

529
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,730
'Certainly not,' I said.

530
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,450
'I am moving into Mr Ashley's room.

531
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,340
Get the blue room ready for Mrs Ashley.'

532
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,429
On the day my cousin Rachel arrived, the house
looked completely different.

533
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,050
Everything was clean and tidy.

534
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,080
Seecombe had got out all the silver and cleaned
it.

535
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,450
Tamlyn, the head gardener, had filled every
room with flowers.

536
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,290
I looked around the house and then walked
up slowly to the blue room.

537
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,620
The dogs followed me.

538
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,440
The rooms for my cousin Rachel were clean.

539
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,070
The windows were wide open.

540
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,940
There was a portrait of Ambrose on one wall.

541
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,850
It had been painted when he was a young man.

542
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,480
He had looked very much like me.

543
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,130
I smiled at the portrait and felt a little
happier.

544
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,310
My cousin Rachel was going to arrive sometime
in the afternoon.

545
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,600
I decided that I did not want to be in the
house when she arrived.

546
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,350
Although the day was cold and windy, I went
out alone after lunch.

547
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,330
I walked until I was tired.

548
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,490
I did not return until after six o'clock.

549
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,490
There was a fire in the library, but the room
was empty.

550
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,320
I pulled the bell and rang for Seecombe.

551
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,630
'Madam has come,' Seecombe said.

552
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,130
'She is tired and is having some food in her
room.

553
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,170
She will be pleased to see you after dinner.'

554
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,230
'Where is her luggage?'

555
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,550
I asked Seecombe.

556
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,110
'Madam has very little luggage of her own,'
answered Seecombe.

557
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,750
'It has been taken upstairs to her room.

558
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,290
All of Mr Ambrose's boxes have arrived with
her.

559
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,670
We have put them in your room, as she asked.'

560
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,040
So I had my dinner alone and drank a glass
of brandy.

561
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,220
Then I went upstairs and knocked at the door
of my cousin Rachel's sitting-room.

562
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:29,160
A quiet voice answered my knock.

563
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,850
CHAPTER SIX
Tea With My Cousin

564
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,020
I went into the room.

565
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,310
Everything was neat and tidy.

566
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,710
The candles had been lit, but the curtains
were still open.

567
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,100
The dogs were in front of the fire.

568
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,140
A woman was sitting with her back to the door.

569
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,340
'Good evening,' I said.

570
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,400
She turned at once, got up and walked towards
me.

571
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,010
Now at last, I was face to face with my cousin
Rachel.

572
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,070
She was a small woman, dressed completely
in black.

573
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,410
Her dark hair was very neat.

574
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:15,800
As she looked at me, her large, dark eyes
opened wide in surprise.

575
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,940
'I hope you are rested,' I said awkwardly.

576
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,550
'Thank you, Philip, yes.'

577
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:29,380
She sat down by the fire and the old dog,
Don, laid his head on her knee.

578
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,280
'Don is your dog, isn't he?'

579
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,500
she said.

580
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,720
'Is it true that he is almost fifteen?'

581
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,010
'Yes,' I said.

582
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,620
'Ambrose gave him to me on my tenth birthday.'

583
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:46,240
'I know,' she answered softly.

584
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,330
Then my cousin Rachel stood up and moved towards
the window.

585
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:55,900
'I want to thank you, Philip, for letting
me come,' she said.

586
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,390
'It can't have been easy for you.'

587
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,660
It had started to rain.

588
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,220
She closed the curtains and we both sat down
again.

589
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:11,610
'I felt so strange, driving up to the house,'
my cousin Rachel said.

590
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,760
'Ambrose told me so much about it.

591
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,010
I was longing to be h... here.'

592
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,680
She hesitated on the last word.

593
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,510
I knew she had nearly said 'home'.

594
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,410
'I hope you will be comfortable here,' I said.

595
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,000
'There are no women servants in the house
to look after you.'

596
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,830
'That doesn't matter.

597
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,440
I don't need anyone to look after me.

598
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,990
I have only two dresses, and some strong shoes
for walking.'

599
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,020
She smiled and I smiled back.

600
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,740
Then I suddenly felt angry.

601
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,810
Why was I smiling at this woman who had caused
my dear Ambrose's death?

602
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,250
At that moment, Seecombe came into the room.

603
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:04,800
'Tea is served, madam,' Seecombe said, putting
down the large silver tray.

604
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,690
On the tray was a large silver teapot that
I had never seen before.

605
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,500
'What about breakfast, madam?'

606
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
Seecombe went on.

607
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,940
'Mr Philip has his at eight o'clock.'

608
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:21,570
'I would like mine in my room,' my cousin
Rachel answered.

609
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,550
'Would that be too much trouble?'

610
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,250
'Certainly not, madam.

611
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,680
Come dogs - downstairs.

612
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,430
Goodnight madam, goodnight, sir.'

613
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,690
My cousin Rachel poured me some tea.

614
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,170
Seecombe had never served tea after dinner
before, but I said nothing.

615
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:48,790
'If you want to smoke your pipe, you can,
Philip,' my cousin Rachel said.

616
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,760
I stared at her.

617
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,010
I did not expect to smoke in a lady's room.

618
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,400
I had wanted to say a few hard words and then
leave.

619
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,880
Now here I was, drinking tea and smoking my
pipe.

620
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,750
But how could I be angry with this small,
neat woman - or hate her?

621
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:14,680
The next thing I heard was a quiet voice saying,
'You're nearly asleep, Philip.

622
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,560
Hadn't you better go to bed?

623
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,050
You walked a long way today, didn't you?'

624
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,690
I opened my eyes and moved my long legs.

625
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,980
Was my cousin Rachel laughing at me?

626
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:33,590
Did she know why I had stayed away from the
house all afternoon?

627
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,800
I got up slowly and looked down at her.

628
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,350
'Wait a minute, Philip,' my cousin Rachel
said.

629
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,640
'I have a present for you.'

630
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,140
She went into her bedroom and came out with
a stick - Ambrose's walking stick.

631
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,350
It was the one he had always used.

632
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,290
I took it awkwardly.

633
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,290
'Now go!'

634
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,550
she said.

635
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,250
'Please go quickly.

636
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,590
You remind me so much of Ambrose.'

637
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,810
I stood outside the door for a moment, holding
the stick in my hands.

638
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,130
Had this woman really killed Ambrose?

639
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,640
I had seen the look of deep unhappiness on
her face.

640
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:38,280
Already, my ideas about her were changing.

641
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:45,400
CHAPTER SEVEN
A Strange Conversation

642
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,030
The following day was Saturday.

643
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,110
I paid the men their wages, as Ambrose had
always done.

644
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,540
But Tamlyn, the head gardener, was not there.

645
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,070
I was told that he was in the gardens somewhere,
with the mistress.

646
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,100
I found them putting new plants into the ground.

647
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,740
'I've been here since half past ten,' my cousin
Rachel said with a smile.

648
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,430
'These are some of the plants Ambrose and
I found in Italy.

649
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,710
I had to put them into the ground quickly.

650
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,030
Tamlyn has been helping me.'

651
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,630
'And I've learnt a lot of things this morning,
Mr Philip,' Tamlyn said.

652
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:30,190
'Mrs Ashley knows far more about these plants
than I do.'

653
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,750
After lunch, I took my cousin Rachel around
the estate.

654
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,900
She sat on a quiet horse and I walked beside
her.

655
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,870
She wore a black dress and a black shawl round
her head.

656
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:49,040
She looked very proud and very Italian - not
like an Englishwoman at all.

657
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,340
To my surprise, my cousin Rachel knew the
name of every field and farm on the estate.

658
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:01,290
As I walked by her side, we began to talk
about the gardens of my cousin Rachel's villa.

659
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:08,120
'When I was married to my first husband,'
she said, 'I was not happy.

660
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,470
So I spent my time planning the gardens of
the Villa Sangalletti.

661
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,210
I would like you to see them, Philip.'

662
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,070
I looked up in surprise.

663
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,260
Didn't my cousin Rachel know that I had been
to Florence and seen the villa?

664
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,260
I thought my godfather had told her in his
letter.

665
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,150
I began to speak, but the horse moved on and
it was too late.

666
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,930
I was very quiet on the way home.

667
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:41,650
After dinner, we sat down together by the
library fire.

668
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,770
My cousin Rachel was sewing.

669
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,620
I smoked my pipe and watched her hands moving
quickly.

670
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,030
They were small, white hands and she wore
two rings on her fingers.

671
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:59,290
'Something is the matter, Philip,' she said
at last.

672
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,110
'What is worrying you?'

673
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,080
'Did my godfather tell you I had been away?'

674
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,400
'No.'

675
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,232
'I didn't hear of Ambrose's death from Signor
Rainaldi's letter,' I said slowly.

676
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:18,600
'I found out about it in Florence, from your
servants.'

677
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,570
My cousin Rachel gave me a long, strange look.

678
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,690
'You went to Florence?'

679
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,690
she said.

680
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:26,690
'When?

681
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,410
For how long?'

682
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:35,280
'I was in Florence for only one night - the
night of the 15th of August,' I said.

683
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,660
The sewing fell from my cousin Rachel's hands.

684
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,980
'But I left Florence only the day before.

685
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,910
Why didn't you tell me this last night?'

686
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,950
'I thought you knew,' I answered awkwardly.

687
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:56,620
'I want you to tell me why you went to Italy,
Philip,' my cousin Rachel said.

688
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,560
I put my hand in my pocket and felt the letters
there.

689
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,340
'I had not heard from Ambrose for a long time,'
I said.

690
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,380
'As the weeks went by, I grew worried.

691
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,870
Then in July, a letter came, a very strange
letter.

692
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,040
I showed it to Nick Kendall.

693
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,150
He agreed that I should go to Florence at
once.

694
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,830
As I was leaving, there was another letter.

695
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,780
I have them both in my pocket.

696
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,620
Do you want to see them?'

697
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,030
'Not yet.

698
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,480
Tell me what you did in Florence.'

699
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,940
'I went to the Villa Sangalletti.

700
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,980
When I asked for Ambrose, the servants told
me he was dead.

701
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,060
You had gone away.

702
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:44,550
They showed me the room where Ambrose had
died and gave me his hat.

703
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,460
It was the only thing you had left behind.'

704
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,060
My cousin Rachel sat very still.

705
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,130
'Go on,' she said quietly.

706
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,880
'I went back to Florence, to Signor Rainaldi.

707
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,350
He told me about Ambrose's illness.

708
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,330
He did not know where you were.

709
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:08,180
I left for England the following day.'

710
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:16,000
There was silence and then my cousin Rachel
said, 'May I see the letters now?'

711
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,090
She read them over and over again.

712
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,500
At last, she handed them back.

713
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,390
Then my cousin Rachel looked deep into my
eyes.

714
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:32,150
'How you must have hated me, Philip,' she
said.

715
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,670
At that moment, I felt that my cousin Rachel
knew everything.

716
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,900
She knew everything I had been thinking about
her, all these months.

717
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:46,500
'Yes, I have hated you,' I said slowly.

718
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,040
'Then why did you ask me here?'

719
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,460
'To accuse you of breaking his heart, perhaps
- a kind of murder.

720
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,790
I wanted to make you suffer, to watch you
suffer.'

721
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,170
'You have your wish,' she said.

722
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:08,590
Her face was very white and her dark eyes
were full of tears.

723
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:12,670
I stood up and looked away.

724
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,380
I had never seen a woman cry before.

725
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:21,220
'Cousin Rachel, go upstairs,' I said.

726
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,590
But she did not move.

727
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,720
I took the letters from her hands and threw
them in the fire.

728
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,300
'I can forget,' I said, 'if you will too.

729
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,620
Look, the letters have burnt away.'

730
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:41,750
'We can both remember what Ambrose wrote,'
my cousin Rachel replied.

731
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,800
'But it's better if I say nothing more.

732
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,490
I cannot explain.

733
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,620
Let me stay until Monday.

734
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,830
Then I will go away.

735
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,590
Then you can either forget me, or go on hating
me.

736
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,710
At least we were happy today, Philip.'

737
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,860
'But I do not hate you now,' I said.

738
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,230
'I hated someone I had never met.

739
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,770
Even before those letters came, I hated Ambrose's
wife because I was jealous.

740
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,030
Ambrose is the only person I have ever loved.

741
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,020
You took him away from me and I was jealous
of you.

742
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,470
Love can do strange things to people.'

743
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:23,140
'I know that,' my cousin Rachel answered.

744
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,350
'Love did strange things to Ambrose too.

745
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,380
He was forty-three when we met and he fell
in love.

746
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,030
He was like someone who had been asleep all
his life.

747
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,470
His love was too strong.

748
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,510
It was too strong for me and too strong for
him.

749
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,960
It changed him, Philip.'

750
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,780
'What do you mean?'

751
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,190
I asked.

752
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:52,280
'Something in me made Ambrose change,' she
replied.

753
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,720
'Sometimes I made him happy, sometimes I made
him sad.

754
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,230
Then he became ill.

755
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,060
You were right to hate me, Philip.

756
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:09,050
If Ambrose hadn't met me he would be alive
today.'

757
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,700
She looked at me and smiled sadly.

758
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,540
'Perhaps I was jealous of you too, Philip,'
she said.

759
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,570
'He was always talking about you.

760
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:25,030
Sometimes I grew very tired of hearing your
name.'

761
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,030
She stopped talking and picked up her sewing.

762
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:33,790
'If you wish, we can talk again tomorrow,'
my cousin Rachel said.

763
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,880
'Then, on Monday, I shall leave.

764
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,990
Nick Kendall has invited me to stay in his
house.'

765
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,950
'But I don't want you to go,' I said.

766
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,700
'There are so many things to do together...'

767
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,750
As I looked down at her, her eyes seemed to
see through me and understand all my thoughts.

768
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,700
'Light me a candle,' she said.

769
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,320
'I must go to bed.'

770
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,810
Then she stood above me on the stairs, looking
down at me.

771
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,870
'You don't hate me anymore?'

772
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,020
she asked.

773
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,020
'No.

774
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:14,450
And are you still jealous of me, or is that
forgotten too?'

775
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,350
My cousin Rachel laughed.

776
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,280
'I was never jealous of you,' she said.

777
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,720
'I was jealous of a spoilt boy whom I had
never met.'

778
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,600
Suddenly she bent down and kissed me.

779
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,130
'Your first kiss, Philip,' she said.

780
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,720
'I hope you like it.'

781
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:58,890
I watched her as she walked up the stairs,
away from me.

782
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:05,310
CHAPTER EIGHT
Two Letters

783
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,920
On Sundays, Ambrose and I had always gone
to church.

784
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,240
This Sunday, my cousin Rachel agreed to go
with me.

785
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,420
Our neighbours were able to see her for the
first time and the church was full.

786
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,110
I heard people saying that my cousin Rachel
was beautiful.

787
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,190
This surprised me very much.

788
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:31,250
As usual, the Kendalls and the vicar and his
family came to dinner.

789
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,310
I had never enjoyed these visits.

790
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:38,150
But, to my surprise, the afternoon was a great
success.

791
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,890
The time passed quickly.

792
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,380
How I wished Ambrose had been with us!

793
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,710
Everyone enjoyed themselves, except, I think,
Louise.

794
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,010
She said very little and did not smile once.

795
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:57,440
When our guests left at six o'clock, my cousin
Rachel and I went back into the library.

796
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,150
'Well, Philip,' my cousin Rachel asked me,
'have you enjoyed yourself?'

797
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,920
'Yes, but I don't know why,' I answered.

798
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,740
'Everyone seemed more interesting than usual.'

799
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:21,100
'When you marry Louise, it will always be
like that,' my cousin Rachel said with a smile.

800
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,090
'A man needs a wife when he is entertaining.'

801
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,700
I stared at her.

802
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,690
'Marry Louise?'

803
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,300
I repeated in surprise.

804
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,370
'I am not going to marry Louise, or anyone.'

805
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,490
'Aren't you?'

806
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,560
my cousin Rachel replied.

807
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,670
'Your godfather thinks you are.

808
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,080
And Louise does too.

809
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,000
She will make you a good wife.

810
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,180
When I am gone, you will need a woman here.'

811
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:54,370
'But you are not going, cousin Rachel,' I
told her.

812
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,070
'What is wrong with this house and with me?'

813
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,580
'Nothing...'

814
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,700
'Tomorrow, you must begin visiting,' I went
on.

815
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,370
'Then our neighbours will visit you.

816
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,760
You will have many things to do here.'

817
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,960
'I don't think I really like that idea,' said
my cousin Rachel, standing up.

818
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,120
'It would be better if I gave your neighbours
Italian lessons.

819
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,060
I am a poor widow and shall need money soon.'

820
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,170
I laughed.

821
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:29,090
'Then you must marry or sell your rings!'

822
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,440
I knew at once that I had been very rude.

823
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,930
It was true that my cousin Rachel had nothing.

824
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:39,220
She could not live without money.

825
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,390
I called the dog and went out into the garden.

826
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:48,150
I felt very stupid and I stayed away from
the house until it was dark.

827
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,570
As I was walking, I had an idea.

828
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,200
Some money must be given to my cousin Rachel.

829
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,260
But I would not tell her that it was my idea.

830
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,200
When I turned back to the house, I saw that
the windows of Rachel's bedroom were open.

831
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,490
'Why are you walking in the dark, Philip?'

832
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,220
a soft voice asked.

833
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,990
'Are you worried about anything?'

834
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,110
'Why, yes,' I answered.

835
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:20,360
'I'm afraid you must find me very rude and
stupid.'

836
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,620
'Nonsense, Philip.

837
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,840
Go to bed.'

838
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,140
Something fell at my feet.

839
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,980
It was a flower.

840
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:38,400
The window was closed quietly.

841
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,080
That week, more plants and small trees arrived
from Italy.

842
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,810
On Thursday morning, I rode over to Pelyn,
my godfather's house.

843
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:51,260
My cousin Rachel was in the garden with Tamlyn.

844
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,260
She told me that she and the gardeners would
be busy until the afternoon.

845
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,140
I wasted no time and I was in my godfather's
study by ten o'clock.

846
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,200
'My cousin Rachel must have some money,' I
said.

847
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,300
'She is talking about giving Italian lessons.

848
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,760
That is impossible!'

849
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,640
Nick Kendall looked pleased.

850
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,980
'I am glad you want to help Mrs Ashley,' he
said.

851
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,410
'The bank can pay some money to her every
quarter.

852
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,890
How much do you suggest?'

853
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,220
When I told him, my godfather looked surprised.

854
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:33,300
'That may be too much, Philip,' he said slowly.

855
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,870
'Ambrose would have wanted me to be generous,'
I said.

856
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,900
'Write me a letter for her, and write a letter
to the bank.'

857
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,870
'You are as impulsive as Ambrose,' Nick Kendall
said.

858
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,750
But he wrote the letters.

859
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,750
'I will take the letter to the bank,' I said.

860
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,640
'But I don't want cousin Rachel to know that
I have arranged this.

861
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,410
Will you send a servant to my house with the
letter for her?'

862
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,660
Nick Kendall agreed.

863
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,450
As I was leaving, I saw Louise.

864
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,630
'I can't stop,' I said at once.

865
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,900
'I have come on business.'

866
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,760
Louise looked at me coldly.

867
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,910
'And how is Mrs Ashley?'

868
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:16,910
she asked.

869
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,600
'Well and happy,' I answered.

870
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,860
'She is very busy in the garden today.'

871
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:26,520
'I am surprised that you are not helping her,'
Louise said.

872
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:33,100
'I'm sure Mrs Ashley can make you do exactly
what she wants.'

873
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:41,400
Louise made me feel very angry and I left
the house without another word.

874
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,540
I rode to the bank and gave them the letter.

875
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,910
I didn't get home until nearly four o'clock.

876
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,000
I did not see my cousin Rachel.

877
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,210
I rang the bell for Seecombe.

878
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,220
He told me that Mrs Ashley had worked in the
gardens until three o'clock.

879
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,510
Then she had asked for water for a bath.

880
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:05,030
I decided to take a bath too and I asked for
an early dinner.

881
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:08,570
Later, I went to my cousin Rachel's sitting-room.

882
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,400
I was feeling very happy.

883
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,110
She was sitting on a stool by the fire.

884
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:17,600
She had washed her hair and she was drying
it.

885
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,260
'Come and sit down,' she said.

886
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,130
'Why are you staring at me?

887
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,420
Have you never seen a woman brushing her hair
before?

888
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,960
Wait here, while I go and change my dress
for dinner.'

889
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,410
My cousin Rachel was in her bedroom when Seecombe
came in with the letter from my godfather.

890
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,400
I stood up, feeling awkward.

891
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,930
There was no sound from the bedroom as my
cousin Rachel read the letter.

892
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,910
Then suddenly, she came out of the room.

893
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:52,010
She looked very angry.

894
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,700
'You made Mr Kendall write this letter,' she
said.

895
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,400
'Did you think I was asking you for money?

896
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,840
I am angry and ashamed.'

897
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,330
'Ashamed?'

898
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,330
I repeated.

899
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:08,960
'I would be ashamed if Mrs Ambrose Ashley
had to give Italian lessons.

900
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,990
What would people think of Ambrose?

901
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,830
The money is yours, take it.'

902
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:17,160
I was angry now.

903
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,000
We stood staring at each other.

904
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,220
Then my cousin Rachel's eyes filled with tears.

905
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:31,490
She turned, went quickly into her bedroom
and shut the door loudly.

906
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:33,470
That night, I had dinner alone.

907
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,010
Is that how women behaved?

908
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,810
Did they always cry when they were angry?

909
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,710
Thank God I had no wife!

910
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,860
Poor Ambrose!

911
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,020
No wonder he had been unhappy.

912
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:51,070
I knew I would never marry now.

913
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,110
After dinner, I read, and then fell asleep
in my chair.

914
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:59,540
When I woke up, it was time to go upstairs
to my room.

915
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,370
On the table by my bed was a note from my
cousin Rachel.

916
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,880
Dear Philip,

917
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,290
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

918
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:11,930
I have written to Mr Kendall thanking him
for his letter.

919
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,800
I thank you too.

920
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,900
Rachel.

921
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,500
The door to her sitting-room was open.

922
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,960
I walked straight through and knocked on the
bedroom door.

923
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,860
The room was in darkness, but I could see
my cousin Rachel in bed.

924
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,030
'I want to thank you for your note and say
goodnight,' I said.

925
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,740
'I'm sorry I made you angry.

926
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,850
I did not want you to cry.'

927
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:42,060
'I cried because of what you said about Ambrose,'
she said.

928
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:47,970
'I will take the money, Philip, but after
this week, I must go.

929
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:51,650
'But I thought you liked it here,' I said.

930
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,380
'You seemed so happy, working in the garden...

931
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,400
You have a home here.

932
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,930
If Ambrose had made another will, this would
have been your home.'

933
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,400
'Oh God!'

934
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
she cried.

935
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,330
'Why do you think I came?'

936
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,270
I looked down at her.

937
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,430
She looked very young, very alone.

938
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:17,600
'I don't know why you came,' I said.

939
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,070
'But I know Ambrose would have wished you
to stay, perhaps to plan the gardens.'

940
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,510
'Very well.

941
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:28,940
I'll stay - for a time,' she said.

942
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,680
'Then you aren't angry with me anymore?'

943
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,030
'I was never angry with you, Philip, but you
are sometimes very stupid.

944
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,680
Come closer.'

945
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:46,520
As I bent down, she took my face between her
hands and kissed me.

946
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:54,560
'Now go to bed, like a good boy, and sleep
well,' she said.

947
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,810
I moved to the door like a man in a dream.

948
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:02,880
When I was back in my room, I wrote a short
note to Nick Kendall.

949
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,740
I told him that my cousin Rachel would take
the money.

950
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,700
Then I walked down to the hall to put my letter
in the post bag.

951
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,160
In the morning, Seecombe would arrange for
the letters to be delivered.

952
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,890
There were two letters in the bag.

953
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,420
Both had been written by my cousin Rachel.

954
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,580
One was addressed to my godfather, Nick Kendall.

955
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,880
The other was addressed to Signor Rainaldi,
in Florence.

956
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,700
I stared at it, before putting it back in
the bag.

957
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,600
Why had my cousin Rachel written to Signor
Rainaldi?

958
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:53,430
What did she have to tell him?

959
01:01:53,430 --> 01:02:01,160
CHAPTER NINE
We Open Ambrose's Boxes

960
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,270
Now it was October, but the weather was fine
and my cousin Rachel was able to work in the

961
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:07,270
garden.

962
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:11,400
We also had time to visit the tenants on the
estate.

963
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,480
They all loved my cousin Rachel.

964
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,940
When they were ill, she gave them medicines
made from herbs.

965
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:24,680
Sometimes in the afternoons, our neighbours
came to the house.

966
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,190
Sometimes my cousin Rachel went to visit them.

967
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:31,220
I enjoyed listening to her at dinner.

968
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:35,310
My cousin Rachel told me about the people
she had seen during the day.

969
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:37,920
She always made me laugh.

970
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,050
But at the end of the month, the weather changed.

971
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,490
Rain fell every day.

972
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:50,250
There was no gardening and no visiting.

973
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,430
One morning, my cousin Rachel and I were standing
at the library window.

974
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:58,260
Outside the rain was falling heavily.

975
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,970
Then Seecombe reminded us about Ambrose's
boxes.

976
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:05,920
They were still in my room and had never been
emptied.

977
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,870
We began to open the boxes.

978
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:13,520
The first box we opened was full of Ambrose's
clothes.

979
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,260
Suddenly my cousin Rachel was crying.

980
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:19,520
Then she was in my arms, her head against
my chest.

981
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,340
'Oh Philip!

982
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,720
I'm so sorry,' she said.

983
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,240
'But we both loved him so much.'

984
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,120
I moved my lips against her hair.

985
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,290
'Don't worry, Rachel,' I said.

986
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,790
'I'll do this.'

987
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:43,110
It was the first time I had called her by
her name.

988
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:48,500
She stopped crying and we continued to unpack
the boxes.

989
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,970
We decided to give Ambrose's clothes to the
tenants on the estate.

990
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,610
Then we began to look at the books.

991
01:03:55,610 --> 01:04:00,610
As I opened a book on gardening, a piece of
paper fell out.

992
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:05,390
It looked like part of a letter, written by
Ambrose.

993
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,330
She cannot stop spending money, I read.

994
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,960
It is like an illness.

995
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,380
If this goes on, my dear Philip, she will
spend everything.

996
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,260
You must tell Kendall in case...

997
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,250
'What have you there?'

998
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,180
my cousin Rachel said suddenly.

999
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,120
'That is Ambrose's writing.'

1000
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:30,650
'It's nothing,' I said and threw the piece
of paper on the fire.

1001
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:32,840
We continued our work in silence.

1002
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:38,850
That same morning, some boxes had arrived
for my cousin Rachel from London.

1003
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:41,460
New dresses, perhaps.

1004
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,770
I remembered the words in Ambrose's letter:
It is like an illness.

1005
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:50,910
She will spend everything.

1006
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:55,550
After dinner, when we went to the library
as usual, the most beautiful blue and gold

1007
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,470
cloth lay over the chairs.

1008
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,220
'Do you like it, Philip?'

1009
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,990
my cousin Rachel asked.

1010
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,000
'It's Italian.

1011
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,880
It will make beautiful curtains for your room.'

1012
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,660
'Isn't it very expensive?'

1013
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,660
I asked.

1014
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,310
'Well, yes, but that isn't important.

1015
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:18,460
If you like it, take it - as a present from
me.'

1016
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:24,080
I thought unhappily about the letter, but
I could say nothing.

1017
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:29,330
As we sat by the fire, my cousin Rachel began
talking about her life in Italy.

1018
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:32,920
She spoke of the time before she had met Ambrose.

1019
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,860
I was listening with the greatest interest,
when she suddenly said, 'What was on that

1020
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,970
paper you threw in the fire, Philip?'

1021
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:48,370
'It was from a letter,' I said, 'Ambrose was
worried about money - I can't remember exactly.'

1022
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,660
The worried look went from Rachel's eyes.

1023
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,850
'Was that all?'

1024
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:54,310
she said.

1025
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,780
'Poor Ambrose.

1026
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,650
He did not understand life in Italy.

1027
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,110
He thought I spent too much money.

1028
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:04,050
He was very generous until he became ill.

1029
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,960
Then he changed so much.'

1030
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,510
'How did he change?'

1031
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,620
I asked.

1032
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:14,780
'When I wanted money for the house, he became
very angry.

1033
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:19,090
In the end I had to ask Rainaldi for money
to pay the servants.

1034
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,640
When Ambrose found out, he refused to have
Rainaldi in the house.

1035
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,350
'It was a terrible time.

1036
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:29,640
I did not want to tell you about it, Philip.

1037
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,340
Ambrose was so ill.

1038
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,550
He trusted no one.

1039
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,500
You wouldn't have known him.'

1040
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,390
'That is all over now,' I said.

1041
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,060
'Don't make yourself unhappy.

1042
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:43,420
You cannot bring Ambrose back.

1043
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,740
This is your home now.'

1044
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,790
My cousin Rachel looked into my eyes.

1045
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:54,690
'You are so like him,' she said.

1046
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,500
'Sometimes I am afraid.

1047
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,680
You must not change too.'

1048
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,580
I took her hands in mine.

1049
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,660
'I will never change,' I said.

1050
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:09,610
'And we must remember Ambrose as he used to
be.

1051
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:13,060
'This house belongs to all three of us now.'

1052
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:20,300
'You are very good to me, Philip,' my cousin
Rachel said as she moved to the door.

1053
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:29,110
'I hope that one day you will be as happy
as I was with Ambrose - at the beginning.'

1054
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,990
She went to bed and I sat alone by the library
fire.

1055
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:36,070
My terrible jealousy had returned.

1056
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:40,050
But now I was jealous of Ambrose.

1057
01:07:40,050 --> 01:08:00,320
I was jealous because of the love that my
cousin Rachel had given him.

1058
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:06,450
CHAPTER TEN
A Christmas Present

1059
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:10,040
In the past, I had always disliked the winter.

1060
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,230
But with my cousin Rachel in the house, things
were very different.

1061
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:18,519
When I was with my cousin Rachel, I was happy.

1062
01:08:18,519 --> 01:08:21,889
When she was away from the house, I was bored.

1063
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:27,440
Life was dull and uninteresting until she
returned.

1064
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,299
Like everyone else, I now thought that my
cousin Rachel was beautiful.

1065
01:08:32,299 --> 01:08:38,429
Whenever she came into a room, she made it
a happier, more interesting place.

1066
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:42,569
In the evenings, we sat together in her small
sitting-room.

1067
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:46,710
We drank tisana as she and Ambrose had done
in Florence.

1068
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,589
The evenings were the best times.

1069
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:52,679
But when I went to my room, I could not sleep.

1070
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:57,859
Any day, perhaps, my cousin Rachel would decide
to go to London.

1071
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:03,799
If she left me, I would feel terribly alone.

1072
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:08,310
When Ambrose had been at home, he had always
given dinner to the tenants on Christmas Eve.

1073
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:13,310
This year, I decided to do the same.

1074
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,770
My cousin Rachel was very pleased.

1075
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,060
At once, she began to make preparations.

1076
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:25,969
Packages arrived from London - presents perhaps
- she began to plan the Christmas meal.

1077
01:09:25,969 --> 01:09:28,190
One thing worried me.

1078
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:31,829
What could I give my cousin Rachel for a present?

1079
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:36,480
I thought about it for a long time and at
last I had an idea.

1080
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,900
I remembered the jewels that belonged to my
family.

1081
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,449
They were kept in the bank for safety.

1082
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:47,480
In three months' time, on my birthday, they
would be mine.

1083
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,889
But I did not want to wait that long.

1084
01:09:49,889 --> 01:09:54,039
And I remembered that Nick Kendall had gone
to London.

1085
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:58,170
I went to the bank that day and asked the
manager to show me the Ashley jewels.

1086
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:02,690
They were very beautiful - blue, green and
red.

1087
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:06,719
But my cousin Rachel always wore black.

1088
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,800
She could not wear coloured jewels with mourning
clothes.

1089
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,670
Then I saw the collar of pearls.

1090
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:18,489
How beautiful the white pearls would look
on my cousin Rachel's neck!

1091
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:24,320
'Your mother was the last woman to wear this
collar,' the manager said.

1092
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,080
'All the brides of the Ashley family wear
it on their wedding-day.'

1093
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,440
I put out my hand and took the collar.

1094
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,360
'I will take this with me,' I said.

1095
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,099
The manager looked worried.

1096
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:41,469
'The pearls are not yours until the 1st of
April,' he said.

1097
01:10:41,469 --> 01:10:45,719
'I don't think Mr Kendall would like you to
take them away.'

1098
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:49,440
'I'll speak to Mr Kendall,' I said.

1099
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,980
I put the collar in its box and stood up.

1100
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:56,090
I knew the pearls were the right present for
my cousin Rachel.

1101
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,500
I felt very excited.

1102
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,070
Then at last, it was Christmas Eve.

1103
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:07,050
Seecombe had brought a tree into the house
and had decorated it as usual.

1104
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,889
Dinner was to start at five.

1105
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:12,300
After dinner, everybody would have a present.

1106
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:18,739
This year, my cousin Rachel was going to give
out the presents with me.

1107
01:11:18,739 --> 01:11:23,130
Before I dressed for dinner, I sent the collar
of pearls to her room.

1108
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:28,249
With it, was a note: My mother was the last
woman to wear this.

1109
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:30,420
Now it belongs to you.

1110
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,710
I want you to wear it tonight and always.

1111
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:36,920
Philip.

1112
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,789
When I was ready, I went downstairs and waited
for my cousin Rachel.

1113
01:11:41,789 --> 01:11:44,640
She came in slowly.

1114
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,079
Her dress was black, but it was one I had
not seen before.

1115
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:52,260
The collar of pearls was round her neck.

1116
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:58,110
I had never seen her look so happy or so beautiful.

1117
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:01,579
She put her arms around me and then she kissed
me.

1118
01:12:01,579 --> 01:12:06,150
She kissed me not as a cousin, but as a lover.

1119
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:09,760
This is what Ambrose died for, I thought.

1120
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,730
And for this I would happily die too.

1121
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:18,349
She gave me her hand and we walked in to dinner.

1122
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:24,090
At first, I thought this was going to be the
happiest evening of my life.

1123
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:28,260
I remember the food, the noise and the excitement.

1124
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:33,060
My cousin Rachel had bought everyone a small
present, carefully chosen.

1125
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:38,030
Mine was a gold chain for my keys with our
initials, RA.R.A.

1126
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:40,269
hanging from it.

1127
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:45,050
Our plates and glasses were filled, emptied
and filled again.

1128
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:49,179
Then we gave everyone a present from the tree.

1129
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:53,949
When dinner was over, I spoke to my godfather,
Nick Kendall, for the first time that evening.

1130
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:59,429
'Good evening, sir, and happy Christmas,'
I said.

1131
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:00,519
Nick

1132
01:13:00,519 --> 01:13:03,460
Kendall looked angry and he said nothing.

1133
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:08,050
He was staring at the collar of pearls around
my cousin's neck.

1134
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,320
Then at last, the tenants had all left.

1135
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,809
Louise and my cousin Rachel went upstairs.

1136
01:13:13,809 --> 01:13:16,960
And I found myself alone with my godfather.

1137
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,309
'I have some bad news from the bank,' he said.

1138
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:25,970
'The manager tells me that Mrs Ashley is already
several hundred pounds overdrawn.

1139
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:29,000
I don't understand it.

1140
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,010
She must be sending money back to Italy.'

1141
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:35,239
'She is very generous,' I said.

1142
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:38,409
'And there were debts in Florence, I think.

1143
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:41,880
You must give Mrs Ashley more money.'

1144
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,920
Nick Kendall looked unhappy.

1145
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,190
'There is something else, Philip,' he said.

1146
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,409
'You should not have taken that collar of
pearls.

1147
01:13:51,409 --> 01:13:54,030
It is not yours.'

1148
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:58,440
'It will be mine in three months' time,' I
said quickly.

1149
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,960
'My cousin Rachel will take good care of it.'

1150
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,280
'I am not so sure,' Nick Kendall said.

1151
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:09,800
'I have been hearing stories about Mrs Ashley
and her first husband.

1152
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,530
They were both well-known for their bad lives.

1153
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,650
They spent money carelessly.'

1154
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,570
'That can't be true!'

1155
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:18,570
I cried.

1156
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:22,469
'True or not,' my godfather replied.

1157
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:25,639
'I'm afraid that collar must go back to the
bank.'

1158
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:30,180
'But I gave it to my cousin Rachel as a present.

1159
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,219
She has a right to wear the collar.'

1160
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:36,719
'Only if Ambrose had lived,' Nick Kendall
said.

1161
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:42,110
'That collar of pearls is worn by the Ashley
brides, no one else.

1162
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:46,429
If you do not ask Mrs Ashley to give it back,
I will.'

1163
01:14:46,429 --> 01:14:53,179
Then suddenly, my cousin Rachel and Louise
were in the room.

1164
01:14:53,179 --> 01:14:56,889
'You are quite right, Mr Kendall,' my cousin
Rachel said.

1165
01:14:56,889 --> 01:15:03,270
'I was very proud to wear the collar and now
I shall give it back.'

1166
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:06,659
And she took off the collar and gave it to
my godfather.

1167
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:11,409
'Thank you, Mrs Ashley,' he said.

1168
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:13,380
'And now Louise and I must go.

1169
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:18,110
We wish you both a happy Christmas.'

1170
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:21,460
When they had gone, my cousin Rachel held
out her arms.

1171
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,610
I went up to her.

1172
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:26,580
'I'm so sorry,' I said.

1173
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,499
'Everything has gone wrong.

1174
01:15:28,499 --> 01:15:33,349
My mother wore those pearls on her wedding-day,
that is why I wanted you to have them.

1175
01:15:33,349 --> 01:15:35,619
Don't you understand?'

1176
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:39,159
'Of course I do, Philip dear,' she said.

1177
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:46,380
'If Ambrose and I had been married here, he
would have given them to me on my wedding-day.'

1178
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,640
I said nothing.

1179
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,940
My cousin Rachel had not understood.

1180
01:15:50,940 --> 01:16:12,360
I was thinking of another wedding-day, a wedding-day

01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:18,239
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Rainaldi Again

1182
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:23,820
The New Year began and my birthday - on 1st
April - was three months away.

1183
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,690
How I wanted to have control of my own money!

1184
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:30,300
I was tired of Nick Kendall being my guardian.

1185
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,250
However, I could spend money on the house.

1186
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:37,489
I decided to make it beautiful for Rachel.

1187
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:40,230
There were many repairs to be done.

1188
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:44,390
From January, I had nearly twenty men working
for me.

1189
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:48,610
The bills for the work were sent to my godfather.

1190
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:51,999
Rachel and I had many plans for the gardens
too.

1191
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:53,749
Work had started on a sunken water-garden.

1192
01:16:53,749 --> 01:16:59,940
We had found the design for the water-garden
in one of Rachel's books.

1193
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:04,300
Because there were so many workmen in the
house, we could not have visitors.

1194
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,920
My cousin Rachel and I stayed quietly at home
and I was very happy.

1195
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,830
I loved to watch Rachel move about the house.

1196
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:14,469
I loved to hear her voice.

1197
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:19,280
When her hands touched me, my heart beat faster.

1198
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,590
The first days of spring came and the sun
shone.

1199
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:28,710
Then something happened which took all my
happiness away again.

1200
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:32,929
I had kept one of Ambrose's old coats to wear
myself.

1201
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:37,370
One day, as I was walking in the woods, I
felt something in a pocket.

1202
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,590
It was another letter from Ambrose.

1203
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:43,239
I was pleased that I was alone.

1204
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:47,300
I walked on until I reached the highest place
on the estate.

1205
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,400
Ambrose had always loved to sit there.

1206
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,200
I sat down and held the letter in my hands.

1207
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,440
I did not want to open it.

1208
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,940
I was afraid that Ambrose had written something
bad about Rachel.

1209
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:05,800
We were so happy together now that I wanted
to forget the past.

1210
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,659
But at last, I opened the letter.

1211
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:15,190
It had been written three months before his
death, but he had never posted it.

1212
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:20,840
My cousin Rachel, Ambrose wrote, had been
expecting a child, but it had died.

1213
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,949
The doctors told her that she could never
have another child.

1214
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:28,130
At first, Rachel was quiet and unhappy.

1215
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:31,820
Then she began to spend money carelessly.

1216
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:35,130
Ambrose suspected that Rainaldi was in love
with her.

1217
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:39,389
For these reasons, Ambrose had not signed
his new will, in which he left everything

1218
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:42,449
to Rachel.

1219
01:18:42,449 --> 01:18:45,349
Ambrose also wrote about his terrible headaches.

1220
01:18:45,349 --> 01:18:49,079
He told me about the fever which at first
made him violent.

1221
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:51,760
Then it made him very weak.

1222
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:58,530
Ambrose was very unhappy and he had written:
You are the only person who can help me, Philip.

1223
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:02,239
Are Rachel and Rainaldi trying to poison me
for my money!

1224
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,570
I must know!

1225
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:11,239
I hid the terrible letter under a large stone
and walked slowly back to the house.

1226
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:14,230
I could not forget Ambrose's words.

1227
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:19,530
But I decided that Rachel must never know
about the letter.

1228
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:23,670
In three weeks' time the estate and all the
money would be mine.

1229
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:26,900
But this was not right.

1230
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:30,980
Ambrose had made a new will, but he had not
signed it because of his illness.

1231
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,329
His money belonged to Rachel.

1232
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:35,730
She must have it.

1233
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:40,650
That night, I asked Rachel about Ambrose's
will.

1234
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:44,389
She showed me a copy of it, which I read carefully.

1235
01:19:44,389 --> 01:19:46,909
Everything had been left to Rachel.

1236
01:19:46,909 --> 01:19:50,749
Then if she had died without children, everything
was to be mine.

1237
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:54,450
'Why did Ambrose not sign this will?'

1238
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:55,450
I asked.

1239
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,929
'Tell me, Rachel.'

1240
01:19:57,929 --> 01:20:02,820
'I don't know,' she answered quietly.

1241
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:07,880
'Perhaps when he knew we could not have children,
his feelings changed.

1242
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,690
Perhaps it was only a mistake.

1243
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:15,949
But when the headaches started, Ambrose suspected
me of terrible things.

1244
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:18,420
I can't speak about that time.

1245
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,030
Please leave me alone, Philip.

1246
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:24,219
I can't answer any more questions.'

1247
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,789
'I have reasons for my questions,' I said.

1248
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:32,320
'You will understand in three weeks' time.'

1249
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,670
By the following morning, I had made up my
mind.

1250
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:40,650
I rode into the town and, with the help of
a lawyer, wrote out a document.

1251
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:45,360
In three weeks' time, all my property would
be given to Mrs Rachel Ashley.

1252
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,739
The jewels would belong to her too.

1253
01:20:47,739 --> 01:20:50,820
But she would not be able to sell the house
or the land.

1254
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:55,080
'I have one question,' the lawyer said.

1255
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,969
'Mrs Ashley is quite a young woman.

1256
01:20:57,969 --> 01:21:02,190
What will happen to the property if she marries
again?'

1257
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,230
I thought for a moment.

1258
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,000
The house and the estate must always belong
to the Ashleys.

1259
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,139
'If she marries,' I said, 'or if she dies,
the property becomes mine again.

1260
01:21:14,139 --> 01:21:17,979
That must be made clear.'

1261
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:21,499
I told the lawyer that the document must be
kept secret.

1262
01:21:21,499 --> 01:21:25,479
He promised to send me a copy on the last
day of March.

1263
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:28,489
I felt very happy as I rode home.

1264
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:31,610
My dear Rachel would never leave me now.

1265
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:35,860
We would live in perfect happiness forever.

1266
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,780
When I reached the house, I heard voices in
the library.

1267
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,920
The door opened and Rachel came out, laughing
happily.

1268
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,269
'Come and see my visitor, Philip,' she cried.

1269
01:21:46,269 --> 01:21:50,679
'He has come a long way to see us both.'

1270
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:54,409
The man stood up and held out his hand.

1271
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,500
It was Rainaldi.

1272
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,449
We stood there, looking at each other.

1273
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:02,929
Then Rainaldi began talking about his journey.

1274
01:22:02,929 --> 01:22:06,059
Rachel suggested that he should stay in the
house for a few days.

1275
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:07,739
I could say nothing.

1276
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:13,539
During dinner, Rachel and Rainaldi talked
about people and places I knew nothing about.

1277
01:22:13,539 --> 01:22:19,070
Often, they spoke in Italian and I could not
understand a word.

1278
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:23,560
At last, Rachel stood up and said, 'You must
excuse us, Philip.

1279
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,850
Rainaldi and I have some business to discuss.

1280
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:30,300
He has brought papers I must sign.'

1281
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,840
They went upstairs and I walked alone in the
gardens.

1282
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,320
I felt cold and unhappy.

1283
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:41,380
I stayed outside until the light went out
in Rainaldi's room.

1284
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:45,340
I had just reached my own room when there
was a quiet knock on my door.

1285
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:50,289
'I came to wish you goodnight,' my cousin
Rachel said.

1286
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:54,480
'Why didn't you come and drink tisana with
us, Philip?

1287
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,599
You must make Rainaldi welcome.

1288
01:22:56,599 --> 01:23:01,249
He is a very old friend of mine.'

1289
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:03,080
Rainaldi stayed with us for seven days.

1290
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,780
As he laughed and talked with Rachel, I began
to hate him.

1291
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:15,469
When it was time for Rainaldi to leave, he
took my cousin Rachel's hand and kissed it.

1292
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:17,820
'Write and tell me your plans,' he said.

1293
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:21,010
'I shall be in London for some time.'

1294
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:28,820
'I am making no plans until after the first
of April,' Rachel replied with a laugh.

1295
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,099
Rainaldi smiled.

1296
01:23:30,099 --> 01:23:33,989
'I hope Philip enjoys his birthday,' he said.

1297
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:38,389
'1st April is All Fools' Day, isn't it?

1298
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:42,960
But perhaps Philip doesn't want to remember
that.'

1299
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,800
When Rainaldi had gone, Rachel smiled at me.

1300
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,739
'You have been very good, Philip,' she said.

1301
01:23:49,739 --> 01:24:09,469
'Are you glad we are alone again.'

1302
01:24:09,469 --> 01:24:12,480
CHAPTER TWELVE
All Fools' Day

1303
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:20,590
As my birthday came nearer, I became more
and more excited.

1304
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:21,590
Rachel laughed at me.

1305
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,150
'You are like a child!'

1306
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,150
she said.

1307
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:28,909
'What plans are you making for the day?'

1308
01:24:28,909 --> 01:24:31,230
But I had made no plans.

1309
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:34,760
All I wanted was that Rachel should know about
the document.

1310
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,769
And one more thing - Rachel should have all
the family jewels.

1311
01:24:39,769 --> 01:24:42,099
I went to the bank myself.

1312
01:24:42,099 --> 01:24:46,659
I brought them back to the house and hid them
in my room.

1313
01:24:46,659 --> 01:24:50,300
On the last day of March, I rode over to Nick
Kendall.

1314
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:54,479
First, I handed him a copy of Ambrose's will.

1315
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:57,080
My godfather looked at it carefully.

1316
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:02,449
'I don't understand why Ambrose didn't sign
it,' he said.

1317
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:05,739
'But we have done all we can for Mrs Ashley.'

1318
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:08,510
'I don't agree,' I said.

1319
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:11,570
'I want to make everything right.'

1320
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:14,790
And I handed him a copy of the document the
lawyer had prepared.

1321
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:17,870
'Read this,' I said.

1322
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:22,070
'And remember that my cousin Rachel knows
nothing about it.'

1323
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:28,070
'I wish Signor Rainaldi had seen this,' Nick
Kendall said slowly.

1324
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:32,969
'He told me how careless Mrs Ashley is with
money.

1325
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:37,599
This document of yours gives her great power
over the property.

1326
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:41,560
I have to ask you one question, Philip.

1327
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,900
Are you in love with Mrs Ashley?'

1328
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,630
My face went red.

1329
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:53,010
'I am only doing what Ambrose wanted,' I said.

1330
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,239
'Perhaps,' Nick Kendall answered.

1331
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,619
'But people are talking.

1332
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:02,530
Mrs Ashley should leave, get married again.

1333
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:05,820
She might marry you if you asked her.'

1334
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:09,929
'I am sure she would not,' I said.

1335
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:13,980
Nick Kendall watched me sadly as I signed
my name on the document.

1336
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:21,400
'There are some women who bring sadness to
all those who love them,' he said.

1337
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,409
'They cannot help it.

1338
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:30,869
I think Mrs Ashley is one of those women.'

1339
01:26:30,869 --> 01:26:33,510
The sun was setting as I rode home.

1340
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:38,800
I bathed, changed my clothes and went into
the dining-room.

1341
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,340
Rachel wanted to know where I had been.

1342
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:44,239
But I laughed and told her nothing.

1343
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,719
After dinner, I was too excited to sit still.

1344
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:48,980
I walked down to the sea.

1345
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:52,860
There was a moon and the night was warm.

1346
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:58,920
I took off my clothes and for a few minutes
I swam in the ice-cold water.

1347
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,920
When I got back to the house, it was five
minutes to twelve.

1348
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,969
I could not wait any longer.

1349
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:08,840
I stood under Rachel's window and called her
name.

1350
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:15,010
When she looked out, I said, 'I have something
for you, Rachel.'

1351
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:17,340
Then I ran to my room for the jewels.

1352
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:20,849
'I want you to have these now,' I said.

1353
01:27:20,849 --> 01:27:25,989
'Listen, the clock is striking twelve and
it is the first of April.

1354
01:27:25,989 --> 01:27:31,760
I am twenty-five and I can do what I like.'

1355
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:37,179
I put the document on her table and began
to open the boxes of jewels.

1356
01:27:37,179 --> 01:27:42,480
Rachel's eyes opened wide in surprise and
suddenly we were laughing together.

1357
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,739
I put the pearl collar round her neck.

1358
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:49,780
As I looked at her, I remembered the other
Ashley women who had worn it.

1359
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:55,289
'You have given me so much,' Rachel said at
last.

1360
01:27:55,289 --> 01:27:58,130
'I have only a small present for you.

1361
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:01,130
What else can I give you?

1362
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:02,170
Tell me.'

1363
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:06,840
'There is one thing,' I said.

1364
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,940
I looked into her dark eyes.

1365
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:13,059
They shone very brightly in the candle-light.

1366
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:17,610
She laughed softly and blew out the candle.

1367
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:20,409
We were alone in the darkness.

1368
01:28:20,409 --> 01:28:24,639
I did not leave her room until sunrise.

1369
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,270
Happiness had come to me at last.

1370
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:30,750
Rachel accepted me and my love.

1371
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:38,239
She was the first woman I ever loved - and
she was the last.

1372
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:42,809
I remember walking alone in the garden as
the birds began to sing.

1373
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:48,770
Rachel and I would be always together now
- day after day, night after night, for all

1374
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,929
our lives.

1375
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:54,110
I went back to my room and slept.

1376
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:57,630
After breakfast, I went into the garden again.

1377
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:02,449
I picked the most beautiful flowers I could
find.

1378
01:29:02,449 --> 01:29:04,579
Rachel was in bed, eating her breakfast.

1379
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:07,000
I threw the flowers on the bed in front of
her.

1380
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,869
'Good morning, again,' I said.

1381
01:29:09,869 --> 01:29:16,579
'I have come to say one thing- I love you.'

1382
01:29:16,579 --> 01:29:19,539
Rachel looked up at me without smiling.

1383
01:29:19,539 --> 01:29:23,010
'You should not come into my room so early,'
she said.

1384
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:28,250
'The servants will talk.'

1385
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,250
I smiled, but said nothing.

1386
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,460
I went downstairs.

1387
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:33,889
I wanted to tell the servants that Rachel
and I were going to be married.

1388
01:29:33,889 --> 01:29:39,150
Then I decided that we would tell them together,
later.

1389
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:43,070
I walked in the gardens until it was time
for Rachel to leave her room.

1390
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:46,989
The day was fine and I decided we should go
out riding.

1391
01:29:46,989 --> 01:29:52,170
But when I got back to the house, Rachel had
already left.

1392
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:55,559
I waited for a long time, but she did not
return.

1393
01:29:55,559 --> 01:29:59,789
At last, I walked along the road, hoping to
meet her.

1394
01:29:59,789 --> 01:30:03,650
When I saw the carriage, I stopped it.

1395
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:07,040
I got in and sat down beside Rachel.

1396
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,699
She was wearing a veil and I could not see
her face.

1397
01:30:09,699 --> 01:30:12,420
'Where have you been?'

1398
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,619
I asked her.

1399
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:16,849
'To see your godfather.'

1400
01:30:16,849 --> 01:30:18,989
'You cannot change anything,' I told her.

1401
01:30:18,989 --> 01:30:20,909
'I am twenty-five.

1402
01:30:20,909 --> 01:30:23,370
Everything I have is yours.'

1403
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:27,499
'Yes, I understand that now,' Rachel said.

1404
01:30:27,499 --> 01:30:29,960
'But I wanted to be sure.'

1405
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:33,499
Her voice was quiet.

1406
01:30:33,499 --> 01:30:35,920
I did not think she was smiling.

1407
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,400
'Let me look at your face,' I said.

1408
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,590
She lifted her veil.

1409
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:45,760
There was no love in her eyes now.

1410
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,770
'I think Louise was a little more friendly
today,' Rachel said.

1411
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:53,570
'She will make you a good wife.

1412
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:57,900
We made plans to meet in London together.'

1413
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,110
I looked at her in surprise.

1414
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:03,010
It was unkind of her to make jokes about Louise.

1415
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:05,570
And why was Rachel talking about London?

1416
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:07,710
We had made no plans to go there.

1417
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:12,150
'Come into the woods, Rachel,' I whispered.

1418
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:17,239
'I want to kiss you so much.'

1419
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:20,570
She did not answer, but took something out
of her bag.

1420
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:26,820
'Here is your present,' she said, and she
gave me a small, gold pin for my tie.

1421
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:31,199
'If I had known about the money, I would have
bought something larger.'

1422
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:38,519
As I dressed for dinner, I could think of
only one thing.

1423
01:31:38,519 --> 01:31:45,510
Money is the one way to please her... the
one way to please her...

1424
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:50,050
When we sat down together for my birthday
dinner, Rachel was wearing the pearl collar.

1425
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:54,840
We both drank wine and I started to feel happier.

1426
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,269
Time would soon pass.

1427
01:31:56,269 --> 01:32:02,139
When the mourning time was over, Rachel would
be my wife...

1428
01:32:02,139 --> 01:32:06,320
While we were sitting at the table, the Kendalls
came into the room.

1429
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:11,170
When they had wished me a happy birthday,
I stood up, my glass in my hand.

1430
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:17,159
'From this morning, I have been the happiest
of men,' I said.

1431
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:20,570
'I want you to be the first to know.

1432
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:23,210
Rachel has promised to be my wife.'

1433
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:25,420
I smiled at them all.

1434
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,499
But Rachel's face was hard and cold.

1435
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:31,639
'Have you gone mad, Philip?'

1436
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:33,429
she said.

1437
01:32:33,429 --> 01:32:34,830
She looked at the Kendalls.

1438
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:38,349
'You must forgive him, he has drunk too much
wine.

1439
01:32:38,349 --> 01:32:41,340
I'm sure he will apologize.'

1440
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:45,070
Rachel got up and the others followed her
out of the room.

1441
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:49,119
I stood without moving until I heard them
leave the house.

1442
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:53,030
When Rachel came back, we stared at each other
without speaking.

1443
01:32:53,030 --> 01:33:00,449
Then Rachel said, 'You had better go to bed,
Philip, before you say any more foolish things.'

1444
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:01,979
'Foolish?'

1445
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:03,179
I repeated.

1446
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:05,710
'But last night...

1447
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,739
Surely you love me, Rachel?

1448
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:09,790
Last night you proved that you loved me.

1449
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,729
It was a promise of marriage...'

1450
01:33:11,729 --> 01:33:16,170
'No, Philip, I had no thought of marriage.

1451
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:19,190
I was thanking you for the jewels, that was
all.

1452
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:22,639
There was no love.'

1453
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,290
I looked at her hard, cold face.

1454
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:30,229
I began to understand what Ambrose had suffered.

1455
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:31,579
She had everything.

1456
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:35,829
What else could I do?

1457
01:33:35,829 --> 01:33:39,329
Suddenly I wanted to frighten her, to show
her my strength.

1458
01:33:39,329 --> 01:33:42,460
I put my hands round her neck and looked into
her eyes.

1459
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:45,800
'Will you marry me now?'

1460
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,989
I whispered.

1461
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:52,770
Her dark eyes were full of fear, but she did
not speak.

1462
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,070
I loosened my fingers.

1463
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:58,869
There were red marks on her white skin.

1464
01:33:58,869 --> 01:34:01,429
Rachel turned and went upstairs.

1465
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:03,880
I followed her, but she was too quick for
me.

1466
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,239
She closed her door and locked it.

1467
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:12,239
As she stood there, I saw myself in a mirror
on the wall.

1468
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:17,900
There I stood, tall, awkward, white faced.

1469
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:22,170
But was it myself or Ambrose standing there?

1470
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:27,199
As I lay in bed, I heard the clock strike
midnight.

1471
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:47,349
All Fools' Day was over.

1472
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:57,119
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Louise... and Laburnum Trees

1473
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:01,929
When I went down to breakfast in the morning,
there was a note for me on the table.

1474
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:05,610
It was not from Rachel, but from Louise.

1475
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:07,000
Dear Philip,

1476
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,409
I was sorry for you last night.

1477
01:35:09,409 --> 01:35:12,840
If you want a friend to talk to, please let
me know.

1478
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,070
Louise.

1479
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:17,989
At first, I did not want to see Louise.

1480
01:35:17,989 --> 01:35:22,630
But I had not slept all night and I was very
unhappy.

1481
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:24,519
Louise knew me well.

1482
01:35:24,519 --> 01:35:27,999
I sent her a note asking her to meet me in
the church that morning.

1483
01:35:27,999 --> 01:35:33,179
'I have been worried about you for a long
time,' Louise told me.

1484
01:35:33,179 --> 01:35:37,099
'She has deceived you from the beginning.'

1485
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:40,270
'I made a mistake,' I said.

1486
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:43,949
'But Mrs Ashley did not,' Louise replied.

1487
01:35:43,949 --> 01:35:46,459
'She came here to get the money.

1488
01:35:46,459 --> 01:35:48,119
She stayed until she got it.

1489
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:49,389
That is all.'

1490
01:35:49,389 --> 01:35:51,409
'I don't believe you!'

1491
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:52,530
I cried.

1492
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:54,539
'She came on impulse.

1493
01:35:54,539 --> 01:35:56,979
She stayed because she was happy here.'

1494
01:35:56,979 --> 01:36:00,920
'No, she had a plan,' Louise replied.

1495
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:05,230
'She has been sending money back to Italy
all the winter.

1496
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:06,719
She waited until you were twenty-five.

1497
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,690
But then you made her a present of everything.

1498
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:12,269
You made things easy for her.'

1499
01:36:12,269 --> 01:36:15,340
'I know you don't like Rachel,' I said.

1500
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:18,320
'That is why you are saying these things.

1501
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,039
But I have asked her to marry me.

1502
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:22,860
And I shall go on asking her.'

1503
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:28,139
'But she will never marry you,' Louise said
with a sad smile.

1504
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:32,869
'When you gave Mrs Ashley the document, she
went straight to my father.

1505
01:36:32,869 --> 01:36:36,039
She asked him if everything now belonged to
her.

1506
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:38,690
My father told her that that was true.

1507
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:43,190
But he warned her that if she married again,
she would lose the money.

1508
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:46,959
She told him she had no plans to marry again.'

1509
01:36:46,959 --> 01:36:52,059
'But if she marries me, she will lose nothing,'
I said.

1510
01:36:52,059 --> 01:36:59,130
'She would not be able to go back to Italy,
or send money there,' Louise said quietly.

1511
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:03,369
She looked at me and said, i will go now,
Philip.

1512
01:37:03,369 --> 01:37:06,119
I have upset you deeply.

1513
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:08,320
I am very sorry.'

1514
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,570
As I rode home, the rain began to fall heavily.

1515
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:16,120
When I got back, I was cold and wet.

1516
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:19,059
There was a note from Rachel in my room.

1517
01:37:19,059 --> 01:37:21,739
I have asked Mary Pascoe to stay here with
me.

1518
01:37:21,739 --> 01:37:27,099
After last night, I cannot be alone with you
again.

1519
01:37:27,099 --> 01:37:30,929
Mary Pascoe, the vicar's daughter?

1520
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:33,900
Mary Pascoe was a large, plain girl.

1521
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,739
Rachel and I had often laughed about her.

1522
01:37:36,739 --> 01:37:38,550
I could not believe it.

1523
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:41,400
But it was true.

1524
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,480
This was the punishment for my one moment
of anger.

1525
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:49,540
Whenever I was with Rachel, Mary Pascoe was
there too.

1526
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:53,699
Oh, God, what had I done.

1527
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:59,270
By dinner-time, I was feeling very ill.

1528
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:01,789
I went upstairs to my room.

1529
01:38:01,789 --> 01:38:05,579
I got into bed and the sheets felt very cold.

1530
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:10,659
I hoped that Rachel would come to me, but
she did not.

1531
01:38:10,659 --> 01:38:13,969
In the morning, I tried to dress, but I was
too weak.

1532
01:38:13,969 --> 01:38:17,579
My neck was stiff and there was a terrible
pain in my head.

1533
01:38:17,579 --> 01:38:18,989
When I called for

1534
01:38:18,989 --> 01:38:23,699
Seecombe took one look at me and hurried out
of the room.

1535
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:26,749
Then my cousin Rachel was there, her face
very white.

1536
01:38:26,749 --> 01:38:31,959
'I will not hurt you, Rachel,' I said.

1537
01:38:31,959 --> 01:38:35,280
'Please send Mary Pascoe home.'

1538
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:42,389
'Don't talk now, lie still,' Rachel answered.

1539
01:38:42,389 --> 01:38:43,949
Then the room was dark.

1540
01:38:43,949 --> 01:38:45,610
The doctor came.

1541
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:47,760
I was hot, then cold.

1542
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,530
I called for Rachel and she held my hand.

1543
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:53,809
'I am with you,' she said.

1544
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:59,590
I closed my eyes.

1545
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:03,840
When I awoke, the room was full of light and
warmth.

1546
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,469
How long had I been asleep?

1547
01:39:06,469 --> 01:39:08,690
Rachel was sitting near my bed.

1548
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:11,560
I put my hand to my face.

1549
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:15,269
'I have grown a beard!'

1550
01:39:15,269 --> 01:39:16,269
I said.

1551
01:39:16,269 --> 01:39:17,269
I began to laugh.

1552
01:39:17,269 --> 01:39:20,590
At once, Rachel was holding a glass to my
lips.

1553
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:23,150
She made me drink the bitter liquid.

1554
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:26,739
'Have you sent Mary Pascoe away?'

1555
01:39:26,739 --> 01:39:28,659
I asked.

1556
01:39:28,659 --> 01:39:29,659
Rachel looked surprised.

1557
01:39:29,659 --> 01:39:34,010
'She went away five weeks ago,' she answered.

1558
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:37,769
'You have been so ill that you nearly died.

1559
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:39,769
The doctors could not help you.

1560
01:39:39,769 --> 01:39:42,800
Your strength and my medicines saved you.'

1561
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:47,520
I lay there, with her hand in mine.

1562
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,330
I could not speak.

1563
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:54,659
Five weeks had passed and I could remember
nothing!

1564
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:58,630
Only that Rachel and I had been married on
the day before my birthday.

1565
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:01,030
We had kept our marriage a secret.

1566
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:08,370
But in two months' time, Rachel would be out
of mourning and we would be able to tell everyone.

1567
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:10,389
I was very weak for a long time.

1568
01:40:10,389 --> 01:40:15,650
But the weather was good and I was soon able
to go into the garden.

1569
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:17,590
The workmen had been busy for many months.

1570
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:21,479
They had dug out the ground to make the sunken
water-garden.

1571
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:24,190
It was very deep, but it was not yet finished.

1572
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:29,190
Yellow flowers hung on the laburnum trees
that Rachel had planted.

1573
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:33,739
I remembered the laburnum tree at the Villa
Sangalletti and the green, poisonous seeds

1574
01:40:33,739 --> 01:40:35,479
lying under it.

1575
01:40:35,479 --> 01:40:43,090
That evening, as Rachel and I were drinking
our tisana, I said, 'I heard something strange

1576
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,090
today.

1577
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:46,099
Seecombe told me you were going back to Florence.

1578
01:40:46,099 --> 01:40:49,699
I thought you had sold the villa.'

1579
01:40:49,699 --> 01:40:53,199
'No, I have enough money to keep it now.

1580
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,639
I shall probably stay there for the winter.

1581
01:40:55,639 --> 01:41:00,050
Perhaps you could visit me in the spring.'

1582
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:01,050
'Visit you?'

1583
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:02,050
I repeated.

1584
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:06,459
'But a husband should be with his wife always.'

1585
01:41:06,459 --> 01:41:08,289
Rachel sat very still.

1586
01:41:08,289 --> 01:41:10,520
'Your wife?

1587
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:14,699
Oh, God, Philip,' she whispered.

1588
01:41:14,699 --> 01:41:17,709
'What do you mean?

1589
01:41:17,709 --> 01:41:21,199
We are not married.'

1590
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,659
'But we are,' I said.

1591
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:25,330
'I remember clearly...'

1592
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:28,999
But as I spoke, the pain returned to my head.

1593
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:32,280
I suddenly knew that our marriage was a dream.

1594
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:36,719
'Why didn't you let me die?'

1595
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:37,719
I cried.

1596
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:41,520
'I cannot live here alone, I cannot.'

1597
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,159
looked at her face.

1598
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:50,510
'Give me a few weeks, only a few weeks,' I
said.

1599
01:41:50,510 --> 01:42:08,249
She did not reply.

1600
01:42:08,249 --> 01:42:14,809
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
What is the Truth?

1601
01:42:14,809 --> 01:42:20,499
The summer came, but Rachel did not speak
of leaving.

1602
01:42:20,499 --> 01:42:21,760
I became stronger.

1603
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:28,719
But sometimes the terrible pain in my head
came back and I could not think clearly.

1604
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,639
But I told Rachel nothing about it.

1605
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:38,020
Then Rachel began to drive into the town - two
or three times a week.

1606
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:44,289
When I asked her about these visits, she told
me that she had a lot of business to do.

1607
01:42:44,289 --> 01:42:49,280
One day when Rachel was busy at home, I rode
into the town alone.

1608
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,179
It was Saturday and the streets were full
of people.

1609
01:42:52,179 --> 01:42:56,099
As I walked slowly through the town, a man
came out of an inn.

1610
01:42:56,099 --> 01:43:01,699
He stood in the doorway for a moment, looking
up and down the street.

1611
01:43:01,699 --> 01:43:03,499
It was Rainaldi.

1612
01:43:03,499 --> 01:43:10,249
That evening, as Rachel was going up to her
room after dinner, I stopped her.

1613
01:43:10,249 --> 01:43:13,480
'How long has Rainaldi been in the town?'

1614
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,030
I asked.

1615
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:17,961
'Why is he here?'

1616
01:43:17,961 --> 01:43:20,600
'Because he is my friend,' Rachel answered.

1617
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:24,790
'I know you hate him and do not want him here.

1618
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,889
Ambrose was jealous of him.

1619
01:43:25,889 --> 01:43:28,150
Are you too?'

1620
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:30,559
'Yes,' I said.

1621
01:43:30,559 --> 01:43:33,869
'I hate Rainaldi, because he is in love with
you.

1622
01:43:33,869 --> 01:43:35,820
Send him away.'

1623
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:38,429
'Certainly not,' she said.

1624
01:43:38,429 --> 01:43:40,349
'I need him.

1625
01:43:40,349 --> 01:43:45,460
I will have him here if I wish - the house
is mine.'

1626
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:49,150
In my anger, I took a step towards her.

1627
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:50,150
'Don't touch me!'

1628
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,150
she cried.

1629
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:52,150
'That is how Ambrose behaved.

1630
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,150
I can't suffer it again.'

1631
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:54,150
I turned away.

1632
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:55,150
'If you want to see Rainaldi, ask him here,'
I said.

1633
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:56,150
'Don't go secretly into the town to meet him.'

1634
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,150
And so Rainaldi came to stay in the house.

1635
01:43:57,150 --> 01:43:58,150
He behaved politely but I could not bear to
see them together.

1636
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:59,150
They always spoke in Italian and she looked
at him all the time.

1637
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,150
Food seemed to have no taste now.

1638
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:01,150
The tisana I drank with them in the evenings
tasted bitter.

1639
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:02,150
Then the fever returned again.

1640
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:03,150
I was sick and too weak to stand.

1641
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:04,150
I had to stay in bed for a few days.

1642
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:05,150
When I was better again, Rachel told me that
Rainaldi had gone back to Italy.

1643
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,150
'When are you going there?'

1644
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:07,150
I asked.

1645
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:08,150
Rachel did not reply.

1646
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:09,150
A day or two later, a letter arrived for Rachel
in Rainaldi's handwriting.

1647
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:10,150
As I drank tisana with Rachel that evening,
I saw the letter on her desk.

1648
01:44:10,150 --> 01:44:11,150
Was it a love-letter?

1649
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:12,150
I had to know.

1650
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:13,150
That night, when Rachel was in bed, I crept
into her sitting- room and searched the desk.

1651
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,150
The letter was not there.

1652
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,150
But in one small drawer, I found an envelope.

1653
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:16,150
Inside it were some small, green seeds.

1654
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:17,150
They were laburnum seeds, poisonous to animals
and to men.

1655
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,150
I put back the envelope and returned to my
room.

1656
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:19,150
There were two bottles of medicine on the
table.

1657
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:20,150
I poured the medicines out of the window.

1658
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:21,150
Then I went downstairs.

1659
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:22,150
The cups from which we had drunk our tisana
had not been washed.

1660
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:23,150
Did the liquid in my cup have a bitter taste?

1661
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:24,150
I could not be sure.

1662
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,150
I went to bed and lay there thinking.

1663
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:26,150
I was not angry, but I was very unhappy.

1664
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:27,150
I remembered Ambrose's words: Are they trying
to poison me?...

1665
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:28,150
Rachel has won - I am dying...

1666
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:29,150
The following day was Sunday.

1667
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,150
Rachel and I went to church as usual.

1668
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:31,150
As she sat beside me, her face was calm and
happy.

1669
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,150
I wished I could hate her, but I could not.

1670
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,150
After church, Rachel went to speak to Mary
Pascoe.

1671
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:34,150
A workman came up to me and said, 'Excuse
me, Mr Ashley, but I wanted to warn you.

1672
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:35,150
Don't walk on the new bridge over the sunken
garden.

1673
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:36,150
It is not finished yet.

1674
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:37,150
Anyone walking on it would fall and break
their neck!'

1675
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:38,150
'Thank you,' I said.

1676
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:39,150
'I will remember.'

1677
01:44:39,150 --> 01:44:40,150
At dinner, Rachel was kinder than she had
been for a long time.

1678
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:41,150
She talked about Florence.

1679
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,150
She said she would look for a stone statue
there to make a fountain for the sunken garden.

1680
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,150
She made tisana as usual, but I refused to
drink it.

1681
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:44,150
I would never again drink anything she gave
me.

1682
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,150
'But it is good for you, Philip,' she said.

1683
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:46,150
'No,' I said.

1684
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:47,150
'You drink it.'

1685
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:48,150
'I have drunk mine already,' Rachel said.

1686
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:49,150
'I will pour this away.'

1687
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,150
We talked together for half an hour or so
and then Rachel said, 'I think I shall walk

1688
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:51,150
for a little.

1689
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,150
I want to look at the sunken garden.

1690
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:53,150
Will you come with me, Philip?'

1691
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:54,150
I shook my head.

1692
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:55,150
'Take care, Rachel,' I said.

1693
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,150
'Of what?'

1694
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,150
she answered with a smile.

1695
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:58,150
'There is no danger here, Philip.'

1696
01:44:58,150 --> 01:44:59,150
I sat by the window until it was almost dark.

1697
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:00,150
Rachel had not returned.

1698
01:45:00,150 --> 01:45:01,150
At last, I ran out of the house and down to
the sunken garden.

1699
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:02,150
The bridge was broken.

1700
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:03,150
My cousin Rachel lay on the ground below.

1701
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:04,150
I climbed down and held her hands in mine.

1702
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:05,150
They were cold.

1703
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:06,150
'Rachel,' I said.

1704
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:07,150
She opened her eyes and I thought she knew
me.

1705
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:08,150
But she called me Ambrose.

1706
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:09,150
I held her hands until she died.

1707
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:10,150
You know now who killed Rachel.

1708
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:11,150
But how did Ambrose die?

1709
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:12,150
Did Rachel kill him?

1710
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:13,150
I shall go on asking myself that question
until the day I die.

1711
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:14,150
I live alone now.

1712
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:15,150
I am a young man, but I think only of the
past.

1713
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:16,150
The two people I loved are dead.

1714
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:17,150
I have an empty life in front of me.

1715
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:18,150
That is my punishment and it is worse than
death.

1716
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:18,152
- THE END -
