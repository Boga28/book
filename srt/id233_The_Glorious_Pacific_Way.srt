1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,740
The Glorious Pacific Way 

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,100
In the South Pacific the history and beliefs 
of the people are told in stories that go  

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,700
back centuries. These stories are not 
written, but live as spoken words,  

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,940
passed on from parent to child, 
family to family, year after year.

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,240
In the modern world it is easy 
for oral traditions to be lost.  

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,220
Ole Pasifikiwei on the island 
of Tiko loves these old stories,  

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,840
so he writes them down. But it is slow work - 
it would be wonderful to have a typewriter...

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,400
'I hear you're collecting oral traditions. 
Good work,' said Mr Harold Minte.  

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,220
'I'm pleased to hear that someone is writing down 
these old stories before they're lost forever.'

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,100
Mr Minte was a diplomat. His voice was friendly,  

11
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,760
but he sounded like a teacher 
speaking to a schoolboy.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,960
'Thank you, sir,' Ole Pasifikiwei said shyly. 
He was not usually shy, except with foreigners,  

13
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,360
but tonight he was at a drinks party 
for diplomats in the beautiful gardens  

14
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,340
of the International Nightlight Hotel, 
and he found conversation difficult.

15
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,720
Ole spent most of the free time from 
his job collecting oral traditions.  

16
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,680
He felt that God was telling him to do this work, 
and it had become the great interest of his life.

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,740
He had begun by writing down his 
own family's history and stories,  

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,860
then went on to other families in the 
village, and then to neighbouring villages.  

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,620
In seven years he had covered 
a fifth of his island country.  

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:29,580
He wrote with a pen in notebooks, which he kept 
in a tall pile in a corner of his house. He  

21
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,820
hoped that one day he would have a typewriter and 
some filing cabinets to keep all the papers safe.

22
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:46,680
People at MERCY (the Ministry of Environment, 
Religion, Culture, and Youth) knew about Ole's  

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:55,920
work on oral traditions, and thought it was a 
very fine thing. A senior official in MERCY,  

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:04,500
who was also a good friend of Ole's, had invited 
him to the drinks party to meet Mr Minte, because  

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:13,380
Mr Minte was in Tiko to talk about development, 
and to find out where aid and money were needed.

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,760
'Perhaps some money will make your 
work easier,' Mr Minte said now to Ole.

27
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,200
'That'll help a lot, sir,' said Ole.

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,620
'We have development money especially 
for cultural projects like this.  

29
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,480
We want to make sure that the Pacific 
Way is not lost. We want to help you.'

30
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,300
'Very kind of you, sir. 
When can I have some money?'  

31
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,160
'After you've written me a letter asking for aid.'

32
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,440
'Do I have to? Can't you just send some money?'

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,240
'You haven't done business 
with us before, have you?'

34
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,220
'No, sir.'

35
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,740
'Things are not as simple as that, you know. 
We have the money to give away, but first,  

36
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:23,460
you must ask us. Tell us what you want. We don't 
want to tell you what you should do. My job is  

37
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:31,680
to tell people that we want to work together, and 
people should ask us for help. Do you understand?'

38
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,000
'Yes, sir. But suppose no one asks?' said Ole.

39
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,820
'That's no problem. When people know they can 
get things from us for nothing, they will ask.  

40
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,000
Come and see me at ten tomorrow 
morning at the MERCY building.  

41
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,540
Think of what I've said and we'll talk about 
it then. I'm pleased we've met. Good night.'

42
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,900
Soon Ole left the party and went home, 
feeling worried and uncomfortable.  

43
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,380
He had never before asked for anything from 
a stranger. 'I'm not a beggar,' he thought.  

44
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:31,920
'If Mr Minte has money to give away, why 
doesn't he just give it? Why must I beg for it?'

45
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:43,080
He began to have feelings of hate for Mr Minte. 
He needed a typewriter and some filing cabinets,  

46
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,840
not for himself, but for the important work he 
was doing. But he was too proud to ask for them.  

47
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:03,600
Was it wrong to be proud? Probably. It wasn't 
easy to ask for things from a stranger -  

48
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,980
but he had to do it because there was no other way 
of getting a typewriter and some filing cabinets.

49
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:20,940
'Oh, well,' he thought, as he lay in bed that 
night, 'it's like breaking the law, I suppose.  

50
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,300
After you've done it once, it 
just gets easier and easier.'

51
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,140
At ten the next morning Ole 
was at the MERCY building.

52
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,900
'Good morning, Ole,' said Mr Minte. 'Have 
you decided if you want help from us?'

53
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,520
'Yes, sir. I'd like to have a 
typewriter and some filing cabinets.  

54
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,940
I'll write you a letter. Thank you.'

55
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,600
'Now, Ole, I'm afraid that's not possible. We 
don't want to tell people what to do with our  

56
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:12,420
money, but there are things that we cannot pay 
for. My Minister at home has to explain to the  

57
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:21,000
government how our development money is used. Why 
does a project about oral traditions in an island  

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,240
culture need a modern machine like a typewriter? 
No, no, the government won't like that at all!'

59
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,480
'But I need a typewriter because...'

60
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:44,280
'No, no, no,' Mr Minte said. 'You have to 
think again. What you ask for must look right,  

61
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,160
feel right for the project.' 
He stopped for a moment.  

62
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:00,660
'Look, we can give you 2,000 dollars a year 
for the next five years for a newsletter  

63
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:09,600
about your project. Publish a newsletter 
every month and send us one copy, OK?'

64
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,080
'But I still need a typewriter to 
publish a newsletter,' said Ole.

65
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,040
'Try using a MERCY typewriter. And you 
will have to have a committee, you know.'

66
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,880
'A committee? What for?'  

67
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,100
said Ole. 'I've worked alone for seven years, 
and no committee has been interested in me.'

68
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,780
'Oh, they will be, they will be, when 
they hear there is good development money.  

69
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:52,380
But we don't give to people, you see, only to 
committees. Get a group of people together,  

70
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:00,240
call them the Oral Traditions Committee or 
something, which will then write to us for help.  

71
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:10,320
Do you understand?' Mr Minte looked at his 
watch. 'I'm sorry, I have to go now to talk to  

72
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
the National Women's Organization. Your women are 
much better at starting committees than your men,  

73
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,500
you know. Their organizations get 
lots and lots of development money.

74
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,460
Think about it and come again tomorrow 
at the same time. See you then.'

75
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,680
Mr Minte went out and disappeared 
into a long shiny black car.

76
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:49,560
Ole stayed in the office, keeping very still and 
breathing deeply until he felt calmer. He always  

77
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:58,020
did this when he was angry. Finally, he got up 
and walked slowly to the office of his friend,  

78
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:08,700
Emi Bagarap, the senior MERCY official. Emi sat 
quietly and listened until Ole finished speaking.

79
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,220
'The trouble with you is that you're 
too honest,' Emi said. 'And too proud.'

80
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,280
'It's not being proud,' said 
Ole. 'It's self-respect.'

81
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,700
'Oh, self-respect is very fine, of course,' 
Emi said. 'But we can't afford it now. When  

82
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,800
our country is developed, then we can be 
proud and have lots of self-respect...'

83
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,900
'And suppose our country is 
never developed?' said Ole.

84
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,200
'We will develop!' said Emi.  

85
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,980
'Of course we will. You have to believe 
that the future is full of hope for us.  

86
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:01,920
Remember that we're playing international games. 
The other players have the money, and we don't.  

87
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:10,380
Simple as that. They make the rules, and we 
try to make the rules work better for us.  

88
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,880
Look at Mr Minte. He offers you 2,000 dollars for 
five years, and he wants you to start a committee,  

89
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:28,380
then the committee writes a letter asking 
for funds and publishes a monthly newsletter.  

90
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:38,520
That's all. But he didn't say anything about what 
kind of committee, or who should be on it, did he?  

91
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,560
You can get three or four friends to be your 
committee. Get people who aren't very interested,  

92
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,800
and who don't know very much. Then 
you'll be free to do the things you need.

93
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,860
'And the letter will come from the 
committee, not from you yourself,  

94
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,780
so your self-respect will not be hurt in any way. 
Although that doesn't really matter, of course.

95
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,900
Another thing. Mr Minte didn't say how 
long the newsletter should be, did he?  

96
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,620
You can write it in a page or two and it 
will take you about half an hour each month.  

97
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:32,280
And you don't have to write it in English. And if 
you wish, you can just publish two copies - one  

98
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:40,620
for you and one for Mr Minte. I'm not telling 
you to do this; that would be dishonest, you see.  

99
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm only explaining to you one of 
the possible ways to play this game.

100
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:55,980
And most importantly,' Emi continued, 'Mr Minte 
didn't say what you should do with the rest of  

101
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:04,920
the money. So. You pay perhaps two dollars a 
year for your newsletter, and with the rest of  

102
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,580
the money you can buy a typewriter and four 
filing cabinets every year for five years.

103
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,340
'You see, Mr Minte is very good and very kind;  

104
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,440
he's been playing international games for a 
long, long time and he understands the rules.  

105
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,920
He wants you to have your typewriter 
and the other things but won't say it.  

106
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,440
Go see him tomorrow and tell 
him you'll do what he told you.

107
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,360
'But remember that when you are 
doing business with foreigners,  

108
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,580
don't be too clever. It's better to look like 
a poor, grateful islander, who knows nothing.  

109
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:59,100
And you're too fat - try to get thinner. 
We need to look like poor, hungry people.  

110
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,140
The reason why Tiko gets very little aid money 
is because our people are too fat and happy.  

111
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,960
I wish our government would realize 
that and do something about it.'

112
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:22,020
And so, Emi Bagarap, who had put his own 
self-respect away in a dark cupboard many  

113
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,480
years ago, taught his friend, the 
learner, the ways of the world.

114
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,940
When Ole left the office, he felt much 
less worried - almost happy, in fact.  

115
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:45,840
He had begun to understand some of life's many 
problems. 'Give me time, dear God,' he thought  

116
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,500
as he walked towards the bus stop, 'and I 
will become an excellent player of this game.'

117
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,340
'A word with you, old friend,' 
Manu's voice stopped him.

118
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,260
'Oh, hello, Manu,' Ole said. 'Long 
time no see. Where have you been?'

119
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,420
'Watching you, old friend. You have that 
look on your face,' Manu said simply.

120
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,960
'What look?' asked Ole, not understanding.

121
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,360
'The look of someone who's been listening to 
people like Emi Bagarap. I'm worried about you.  

122
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,020
I must tell you before it's too late.  

123
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,640
Don't let Emi or people like him 
persuade you to do something you-'

124
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:50,760
'I never let anyone persuade me to do anything 
that I don't want to do,' said Ole, very crossly.

125
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,880
'It's already happened, old friend; 
it's written all over your face.  

126
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:06,480
Be careful of Emi. He has sold his soul, and 
will make you sell yours if you're not careful.'

127
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,660
'That's stupid. No one has 
sold his soul,' said Ole.  

128
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,000
'We're just being sensible, until 
we get what's good for the country.'

129
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,220
'No, no, old friend. You are selling your soul.  

130
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,200
And you'll never get it back 
because you will not want to.'

131
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,300
'I don't have time for this, Manu. You belong to 
the past; it's time to wake up to the future.'  

132
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
And with those sharp words 
Ole walked quickly away.

133
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,020
Next day when he met Mr Minte he was all smiles.  

134
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,800
The diplomat saw the change in Ole, and 
gave a smooth little smile in return.  

135
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:05,340
He had seen this change many times before. It 
was part of his job to make this change happen.

136
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,980
'So, Ole, when will you start the committee?'

137
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,140
'Tonight, sir.'

138
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,820
'Well done, Mr Chairman. If your 
secretary writes me a letter,  

139
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:28,320
you'll get your first 2,000 dollars in 
a month's time.' 'Thank you very much,  

140
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:36,000
Mr Minte. I'm most grateful.' 'You're welcome. 
I've enjoyed doing business with you, Ole.  

141
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:46,080
You have a great future. If you need anything, 
just tell me. You know, the Pacific needs more  

142
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,620
people like you. Then these countries would 
develop faster than the speed of light.'

143
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:02,100
They shook hands, and as Ole opened 
the door, Mr Minte called out, 'Ah yes,  

144
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,400
there will soon be a training course in 
Manila on collecting oral traditions.  

145
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:15,240
You should go; it will be good for 
you. I'll let you know in a few weeks.'

146
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,420
'Thank you again, Mr Minte.'

147
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:27,780
'Don't mention it. I'm always happy to 
help. Goodbye for now. I hope you'll  

148
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:35,640
soon get a typewriter and filing cabinets.' 
Ole sang quietly to himself on the way home,  

149
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:44,040
very happy. That evening the Committee for 
the Collection of Oral Traditions was born.  

150
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:52,620
Ole was the chairman, his youngest brother 
was the secretary, and three friends became  

151
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:00,540
committee members. The Committee began work 
immediately and wrote a letter to Mr Minte  

152
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:09,180
which was taken to the MERCY building the next 
day. A month later Ole received a cheque for  

153
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:16,800
2,000 dollars and a letter inviting him to 
go on a six-week training course in Manila.  

154
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:26,220
He went, leaving his house in the care of his old 
aunt, who did not understand what he was doing.

155
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,500
He found the training course hard to understand, 
and the night-life in Manila was much more  

156
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:44,280
exciting. In fact, Ole had a very enjoyable time 
indeed, and in the third week he had to visit a  

157
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,160
doctor, who was most kind and understanding, 
and gave Ole the necessary medicine.

158
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,200
On his way home Ole bought a 
typewriter in Sydney airport,  

159
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,980
and also ordered four filing cabinets, 
which would come to the island by ship.  

160
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,660
He was very pleased. His dream 
was coming true, and so quickly!  

161
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:22,080
As his plane landed at Tiko airport, he 
saw himself in the future - the head, no,  

162
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,020
the President of the National 
Committee for Island Culture.

163
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,660
When he finally arrived home, his old 
aunt greeted him with tears of happiness.

164
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,780
'Ole, Ole, you're safe. Thank God 
those foreigners didn't eat you.  

165
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,740
You look so thin; what did they do to you?'

166
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,700
'Don't worry, auntie,' Ole laughed.  

167
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,080
'Those foreigners don't eat people. 
They only shoot each other.'

168
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,360
'You look so sick. Did they try to shoot you too?'

169
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,400
'I'm very healthy.' Ole laughed, remembering 
his night-life adventures in Manila.

170
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,320
'What's the matter, Ole? Why are you laughing?'

171
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,960
'The house looks very tidy,' Ole said quickly.  

172
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,320
'Thank you for taking care of it. 
You are always very good to me.'

173
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,700
'Oh, Ole, I cleaned the place from 
top to bottom,' said his aunt.  

174
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:42,780
'You need a wife to clean up after you. Why 
don't you get married? You were always untidy,  

175
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,600
and you haven't changed. I threw out 
so much rubbish from your house.'

176
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,220
These words began to worry Ole a little.

177
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,560
'You did, did you? And what 
did you do with my books?'

178
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,740
'Books? What books?'

179
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,320
'Those notebooks in the pile 
in the corner of the room.'  

180
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:17,280
'You mean those dirty old school notebooks? They 
had all kinds of insects living in them, Ole.'

181
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,200
'They're the most important things in my life,' 
said Ole, and went looking for his books.  

182
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,740
'They aren't here. What have 
you done with them?' he shouted.

183
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,000
'Sit down, Ole, and let's talk calmly.'

184
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,180
'No! Where are they?'

185
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:49,920
'Ole, you've always been a good boy. Sit down 
and have something to eat. You must be hungry.'

186
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,840
'Never mind that, I want my books!'

187
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:02,940
'Sit down and don't scream at me. 
That's a good boy. We're poor,  

188
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:12,840
you, me, the neighbours. Food is 
expensive.' 'Where are my books?'

189
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,380
'We can't afford toilet paper. 
It used to be ten cents.'

190
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,180
'Yes, but what about my books?'

191
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:32,880
'You didn't leave me any money when you went 
away, Ole. I had to eat, and keep clean.  

192
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,900
Things are so expensive.'

193
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,500
'I'm sorry, but where are my books?'

194
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:54,540
'Don't keep asking me that question, Ole. I'm 
trying to explain. I'm your only living aunt.  

195
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,980
And I'm very old, and ready to go 
to Heaven. Don't hurry me, please.  

196
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,740
Don't you think I'm more 
important than some old book?'

197
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,020
'What did you do with them? Where are they?'

198
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:23,940
'Ole, I had no money for food, no money for 
toilet paper. I had to eat and keep clean.  

199
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,060
Stop looking at me like that. You frighten me.'  

200
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:41,760
She stopped, then went on very quietly. 'I used 
some and sold the rest cheaply to the neighbours.  

201
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,880
They're poor, Ole, but they 
also have to keep clean.'

202
00:24:49,620 --> 00:25:00,120
Ole stared at his aunt. He could not believe it. 
'No, no, you're just having some fun with me.  

203
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,680
You didn't really sell my 
books for toilet paper...'

204
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:17,040
'I did. Yes, yes, I did. I'm sorry, but I didn't 
know they were important. How could I know?'

205
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,820
'Oh, my God!'

206
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:29,640
Ole could not speak for a moment. 
He sat very still, breathing deeply.  

207
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:44,880
Then slowly, very slowly, he whispered, 'Seven 
years' hard work down the toilet; shit!'

208
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:55,320
Suddenly the meaning of the word 'shit' 
hit him, and he began laughing wildly,  

209
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:05,460
with tears running down his face. At the same 
moment the best idea of his life came to him.

210
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,660
He put his arms round his aunt and 
said he was sorry for being angry.  

211
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,580
The old lady was very surprised at this sudden 
change in him, and cried with happiness.

212
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,000
Ole remembered that Mr Minte's government had 
promised him 10,000 dollars over five years.  

213
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,580
That was the start. Ole Pasifikiwei,  

214
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:42,480
whose books had gone down the toilet, 
would now go fishing in the big seas.

215
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,100
'If I am a beggar,' he told himself,  

216
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:55,380
'I will be a big beggar, a grand 
beggar, the best beggar of all.'

217
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,140
He wrote Mr Minte a letter, and not long 
afterwards Dr Andrew Wheeler arrived on  

218
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:12,360
the island. Dr Wheeler was a very clever 
man and knew all about development aid.  

219
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,200
With his help, Ole began a National 
Committee for Cultural Studies,  

220
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:28,200
and on the Committee he got chiefs, 
government ministers, VIPs, wives of VIPs,  

221
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,960
and his old friend, Emi Bagarap. 
He himself was full-time secretary.  

222
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:45,780
Then Dr Wheeler wrote a plan for a four-year 
project, and letters asking for 400,000  

223
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:54,660
dollars in aid. The letters were sent to every 
organization which had aid funds to give away.

224
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,600
A little later, again with Dr Wheeler's help,  

225
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,240
Ole formed eighteen other national 
committees and organizations.  

226
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,640
They all had wonderfully necessary and important 
projects, which needed generous development aid.  

227
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:23,460
And after six years Ole had asked for 14 
million dollars for his different committees.  

228
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:31,500
His name was now well known by all the 
important aid people in Brussels, The Hague,  

229
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:45,120
Bonn, Geneva, Paris, London, New York, Washington, 
Wellington, Canberra, Tokyo, Peking, and Moscow.  

230
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,860
The University of the Southern Paradise,  

231
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:57,000
recognizing what a great man Ole had 
become, gave him many grand titles.

232
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,520
Ole Pasifikiwei became an extraordinarily 
clever player of international aid games,  

233
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:13,680
enjoying every new rule and learning how 
to turn it upside-down and inside-out.  

234
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,940
His early worries about self-respect  

235
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:28,500
have disappeared, and he works hard at his 
full-time job of first-class, expert beggar.
