CHAPTER ONE
The Madman on the Beach

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:13,820
When I saw Rafael for the first time, I was
twelve years old.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,779
My family lived in a big town, far away from
the sea.

4
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:26,269
But my Uncle Miguel and his family lived in
a little village on the coast.

5
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:34,489
He had a cafe and a small farm there, and
sometimes my family visited him.

6
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:42,460
There in that village I met poor, mad Rafael.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,949
I didn't know then who he was.

8
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:49,289
I didn't know why he was mad.

9
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,260
I knew nothing of his strange and terrible
story.

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,699
Now, fourteen years later, I know exactly
what happened.

11
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,670
But Rafael is dead.

12
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,049
Why should I tell people his terrible secret?

13
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,530
Only I know what happened to Rafael.

14
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,540
Only I know what happened to the young and
beautiful Anita.

15
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,490
And to the soldier.

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,240
Only I.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,010
The people in the village told me what they
knew.

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,060
Their stories were all true.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,140
Every word.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,840
My uncle, his wife, Rodrigo the shopkeeper
- nobody lied to me.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Nobody.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,280
Not even poor Clara, Rafael's mother.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,610
And she was already dead when I went back
to the village.

24
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,090
Their stories were all true.

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,750
But they didn't know what really happened.

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,799
The first time I saw Rafael, I was walking
along the beach with my younger brother Pablo.

27
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,909
Our parents were talking with my uncle and
his family.

28
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,320
We boys went along the beach to look around.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,970
At the end of the beach there were high black
rocks, where the mountains behind the village

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,690
came down into the sea.

31
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,250
Near them was an old wooden boat-house.

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,850
It had no doors.

33
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,610
The roof was broken at one end, and open to
the sky.

34
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,460
Inside there was an old wooden fishing boat.

35
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,440
My brother and I looked inside.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,250
The sand was deep and soft on the floor.

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,730
Suddenly, in a corner behind the boat, something
moved in the shadows.

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,010
It was a dirty young man with long hair and
a beard.

39
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,980
He stood up and looked at us.

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,780
His eyes were open, but empty.

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,950
He looked at us, but he didn't see us.

42
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,010
He was very thin.

43
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,860
He put one hand to his neck.

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,830
I saw something shining under the dark beard.

45
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,980
There was something small and bright on a
thin fishing line round his neck.

46
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,560
He pulled it out to show us.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,960
It was a small gold ring in the shape of a
fish.

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,210
Suddenly he spoke.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,390
His voice was clear, but thin and high.

50
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,940
He spoke words, but they didn't mean anything.

51
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,570
'She gave me the golden fish,' he said.

52
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,210
'She gave it back to me.'

53
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,230
Then he laughed.

54
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,140
And when he laughed, my brother and I were
very afraid.

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,510
He laughed and laughed, but his eyes were
big and sad.

56
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,350
We ran out of the boat-house.

57
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,730
The thin young man came out behind us.

58
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,360
He stood in the sunshine and laughed.

59
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,920
'She gave me the ring,' he shouted.

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,250
'I still have it.'

61
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,049
Some little boys from the village came running.

62
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:22,970
Some of them threw stones at the thin, dirty
man.

63
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,550
'Crazy Rafael!'

64
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,130
they shouted.

65
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,400
Crazy Rafael!'

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,439
He stopped laughing and screamed at them.

67
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,599
Then he went back inside the boat-house.

68
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,189
The children laughed and ran away.

69
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,880
We went back to my uncle's house.

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,729
'Who is that crazy man on the beach?'

71
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,740
we asked.

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,080
'The children called him Rafael.'

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,460
'He's only a poor, mad young man,' said my
uncle.

74
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,720
'He isn't dangerous.

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,900
He went mad about a year ago.

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,240
We don't know why.

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,470
Nobody can help him.

78
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,949
I'm afraid.

79
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,560
His mother lives in the house at the end of
the village.

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
She brings him food every day.

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,979
All the people in the village help her when
they can.'

82
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,819
Soon the adults began to talk about other
things.

83
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,169
But I never forgot poor, mad Rafael.

84
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,810
Every time I thought about the village, I
remembered the poor, mad man in the boat-house

85
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,380
on the beach.

86
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,810
Sometimes I saw him in my dreams.

87
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,169
He looked at me with his big, empty, mad eyes.

88
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,229
He called to me.

89
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,699
He had the gold ring round his neck, and he
held it out to me.

90
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:53,520
He called for me to help him.

91
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
***

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,080
My family went back to the town.

93
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,770
After I left school, I went to university
in the capital.

94
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,900
I studied to be a doctor.

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,310
I spent two years in the USA.

96
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:16,180
Finally, I came back to my home town and I
found work in a big, new hospital there.

97
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,720
In all those years, I never went back to the
village.

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:28,919
But then one of my uncle's sons got married
and all my family went there for a few days.

99
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,740
There were many changes in the village.

100
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,819
Twelve years of change.

101
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,199
There were new stone houses.

102
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:42,330
There were new, brightly-painted fishing boats
along the beach, a lot of them with engines.

103
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,760
My uncle had a big, clean, new cafe with tables
and chairs, and a television in the corner.

104
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,249
It was all very different from the village
that I saw as a boy.

105
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,809
I went down to the beach on my first afternoon
in the village.

106
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:04,699
I wanted to see again the place where I first
saw Rafael.

107
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,090
I couldn't believe it.

108
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,400
The old boat-house and the boat were still
there.

109
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,720
The boat was in pieces now, but the boat-house
was bigger and stronger.

110
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,509
There was some new wood on the walls and a
new roof on it.

111
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:27,169
I walked along the beach and felt the soft
sand under my town shoes.

112
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:32,069
There was a man sitting near the old boat-house.

113
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,710
He was looking at the sea.

114
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,439
He had long hair and long, thin legs.

115
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,249
I came closer and he suddenly looked round
at me.

116
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,219
It was Rafael.

117
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:54,879
I saw again those same wide, crazy, sad eyes,
the eyes from my dreams.

118
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,050
He was twelve years older.

119
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:04,629
His hair and beard were beginning to go grey,
but they weren't as long and dirty as before.

120
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,379
His face was very thin and he looked ill.

121
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,030
His clothes were old, but clean.

122
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,949
'How are you, Rafael?'

123
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,069
I called, smiling.

124
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,729
He put his head on one side and looked at
me.

125
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,939
His mouth opened and he smiled.

126
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:29,919
A thin brown hand moved up to his neck.

127
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,200
'She gave me the golden fish,' he said.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,729
His voice was flat and empty.

129
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,300
He coughed suddenly - a deep, dry cough.

130
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:51,070
Then he looked with sad yellow eyes at the
bright, empty sea.

131
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:59,250
I went back across the soft white sand to
my uncle's house I had an idea in my head.

132
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,180
I was a doctor now.

133
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,900
Perhaps I could find out what was the matter
with this poor man.

134
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,000
I could give him the best help that modern
medicine could give him.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
I told my uncle what I wanted to do.

136
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,980
'There are special hospitals now in the capital
for people like Rafael.

137
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,610
I can take him there.

138
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,590
If I can make him well, I will.

139
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,500
If not, he can stay in a hospital there.

140
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,580
He will have a bed, good food, nurses all
the time.

141
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,300
It's not good for him to sleep on the beach.

142
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,330
He looks ill.'

143
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,560
I asked him to tell me about Rafael.

144
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,910
He told me everything that he knew.

145
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,020
It was a long and strange story.

146
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,020
I wrote it all in a notebook.

147
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,220
I wanted to help the poor madman to get well.

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:06,310
For this, I had to know everything about him.

149
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:12,100
CHAPTER TWO
Rafael's Father and the Sharks

150
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,380
Told by my uncle

151
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,990
Rafael was born in the village (my uncle said).

152
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,880
His father was called Manuel and he was a
fisherman.

153
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,330
His mother, Clara, is also dead now.

154
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,370
She was the sister of my own wife, Rosa.

155
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,840
Rafael was their only child.

156
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,460
He was a fine boy, never ill, good-looking,
healthy and strong.

157
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,020
When he was about eight years old, his father
was killed.

158
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,490
It was a terrible thing for the young boy.

159
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,780
He was there and saw his father die.

160
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,570
They were out in their boat, fishing with
some other men from the village.

161
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,980
I don't know what happened exactly.

162
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,880
Something happened to the fishing nets; perhaps
they were caught under the boat.

163
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,540
Manuel went into the water to do something
with them.

164
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,420
Suddenly a shark attacked him.

165
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,790
It was a complete surprise.

166
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,870
The other fishermen could do nothing to help
him.

167
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,320
It was a big white shark.

168
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,240
It came up from deep water and bit off one
of Manuel's legs - a clean bite above the

169
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,110
knee.

170
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,910
The other men pulled him into the boat.

171
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,690
The blood from his leg ran deep in the bottom
of the boat.

172
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,780
The men put a shirt round the top of his leg.

173
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,860
They tried to stop the blood, but it was impossible.

174
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,190
They say that Manuel was calm at first.

175
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,130
He felt no pain.

176
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:04,690
He smoked a cigarette and he talked to little
Rafael, in the boat next to him.

177
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,020
But after a few minutes he went very white.

178
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,510
Then he began to feel very cold.

179
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,700
The men covered him with their clothes to
keep him warm.

180
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,830
But he became very weak and sleepy.

181
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,520
Suddenly he put his hand on Rafael's head.

182
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,740
'Be a good son,' he said.

183
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,230
His voice was terribly tired.

184
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,190
'Help your mother.'

185
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,690
Then he fell asleep, and in a few minutes
his heart stopped.

186
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,530
After that, Rafael and his mother, Clara,
lived alone in their house at the end of the

187
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,530
village.

188
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,260
Manuel's brother, Ricardo, helped Clara with
money.

189
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,940
All the people in the village helped her.

190
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,000
Manuel was a good man.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,970
We always help our people when they need it.

192
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,690
In a few years Rafael was older and started
to work.

193
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,860
He became a fisherman, too.

194
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,830
He and his mother were poor, but he could
earn enough money for them both.

195
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,970
Rafael was a fine boy.

196
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,800
He became a good fisherman.

197
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,650
But he always hated sharks, because of what
happened to his father.

198
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,460
Every few months, he did something very strange.

199
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:40,230
When anyone in the village killed an animal
for meat, Rafael asked them for the skin and

200
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,120
the stomach.

201
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,470
He took the insides of the animal that nobody
wanted.

202
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,590
Then he went out in his boat alone, far from
the land.

203
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:59,870
There he threw the pieces of the animal into
the sea and waited for the sharks to come.

204
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,840
A shark can smell blood in the water when
it is many kilometres away.

205
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Soon a lot of sharks arrived in the water
round his boat.

206
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
Then Rafael took his fishing spear.

207
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,900
He stood up in his boat and killed one or
two of them.

208
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,260
When he killed a shark, the other sharks tasted
the blood.

209
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,550
They began to bite and eat the shark.

210
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,400
So then there was more blood in the water
and more sharks came.

211
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Rafael killed more and more.

212
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,100
After an hour he was almost too tired to stand.

213
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,230
It was a really dangerous thing to do in a
small boat.

214
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,970
But he was smiling when he told me about it.

215
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,280
He was really happy about the dead sharks,
because a shark killed his father.

216
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,700
So Rafael grew up, tall, strong and good-looking.

217
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:07,180
And, of course, he fell in love with Anita,
the shopkeeper's daughter.

218
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:16,630
So now (said my uncle), I have to tell you
about Anita, too.

219
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:22,270
CHAPTER THREE
Anita, the Shopkeeper's Daughter

220
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,740
Told by my uncle

221
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,510
Anita was a beautiful child (my uncle continued).

222
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,060
I know, most children are beautiful.

223
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,140
But she was the most beautiful child that
I've ever seen.

224
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,090
Everyone loved her.

225
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:48,660
Little children, old people, men and women,
they all loved Anita.

226
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,370
They smiled when they saw her.

227
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,970
And year after year she grew up, and year
after year she grew more beautiful.

228
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,050
Her father, Rodrigo, the shopkeeper, loved
her most.

229
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,080
He tried to keep her close to him, always.

230
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,050
She could never go out and talk with the village
boys.

231
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,360
But this is a small village.

232
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,280
It was impossible to keep her at home all
the time.

233
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:25,720
She was a good girl, but all the young men
dreamed of her and wanted to marry her.

234
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,010
She was not only beautiful.

235
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,410
She was clever, too.

236
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,410
Her father could read and write.

237
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,530
Most of the people in the village couldn't.

238
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,060
We had no school in the village in those days.

239
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,360
So Rodrigo taught Anita to read and write.

240
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,980
He often went into the town to buy things
for his shop.

241
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,240
Then he brought back picture magazines and
small story books for her.

242
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,130
Anita was very good at reading and telling
stories.

243
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,880
She remembered everything that she read.

244
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,249
When she was only nine or ten, she often sat
near the house under a tree with a book.

245
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:14,409
There she read or told stories to her little
brothers and sisters.

246
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,959
Soon the other children of the village came
and sat round her.

247
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,399
Some of the fishermen, old and young, sat
on the beach near the shop, too.

248
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:30,460
They liked to listen to little Anita when
she told her stories.

249
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,440
Of course, Rodrigo had big plans for Anita.

250
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,720
He was so proud of her.

251
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,059
He wanted her to marry someone rich and important.

252
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,860
Perhaps a man from the city, who was able
to help Rodrigo's business.

253
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,669
Everyone knew one thing for sure.

254
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,149
He didn't want Anita to marry anyone from
the village.

255
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:59,059
Rafael loved her very much.

256
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,000
They say Anita loved him, too.

257
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,320
But there was no hope for him.

258
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,600
Rodrigo didn't want a poor fisherman to be
Anita's husband.

259
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,690
Poor Rodrigo.

260
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,240
He loved Anita and he had great hopes for
her.

261
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,510
When she ran away, it was terrible for him.

262
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,159
He still doesn't talk about it.

263
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,940
Not a word.

264
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,080
Not after all these years.

265
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
For him, he says,

266
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,200
Anita is dead.

267
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,529
He has no daughter of that name.

268
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,529
***

269
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:39,529
'But where did she go?'

270
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,549
I asked my uncle.

271
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,380
'Someone knows.

272
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,229
And why is Rafael mad?

273
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:50,740
Not because Anita ran away from home.

274
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,249
She didn't run away with him, did she?'

275
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,660
'No, she didn't,' answered my uncle.

276
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,850
'That's for sure.

277
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,470
Nobody knows where she went.

278
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,679
But Rafael stayed in the village.

279
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,679
And that was the time when he went mad.

280
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,280
I believe that Anita ran away with the soldier.

281
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I think they're married.

282
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,330
They're probably living in another town, far
away.

283
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,999
But that's only my opinion.

284
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:24,620
I don't really know.'

285
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,480
'The soldier?

286
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,340
What soldier?'

287
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,210
I asked.

288
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,950
My uncle smiled and looked at his watch.

289
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:41,110
'It's a long and strange story,' he said.

290
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,799
CHAPTER FOUR
The Soldier

291
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,730
Told by my uncle

292
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:58,260
The soldier (said my uncle) came to the village
about three months before Anita ran away.

293
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,450
She was sixteen years old then, and Rafael
was eighteen.

294
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,679
The soldier was a strange man.

295
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,529
His real name was Carlos, but everyone called
him 'the soldier'.

296
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,970
He told us about his life.

297
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,450
'I've been a soldier all my life,' he told
us.

298
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,039
'I was in Cuba for six years.

299
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,559
Then I fought in Africa and many other places.

300
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,220
I've seen the world, my friends.'

301
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,820
He had a thousand stories.

302
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,559
But nobody ever knew where he came from.

303
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,980
He was Very handsome, with bright eyes and
long, dark hair.

304
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,049
He was a soldier, a sailor, a fisherman - everything.

305
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,289
He had a small boat with an engine.

306
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,159
That was unusual in those days.

307
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,230
He worked for nobody.

308
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,049
He went where he wanted to.

309
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,940
He did what he wanted to.

310
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,840
He bought things and sold things.

311
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,279
He could get anything that you wanted, for
a price.

312
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,460
He sailed into our village late one afternoon.

313
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,200
He anchored his boat a few metres from the
shore and walked up the beach.

314
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,909
I never knew what he came for.

315
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:24,860
It was just a small thing that he wanted,
probably.

316
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,820
First he went to Rodrigo's shop.

317
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,019
Then he came to my cafe and sat for an hour
and talked.

318
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,370
And there he saw Anita, sitting by the corner
of the shop.

319
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:43,749
The children were all round her on the ground
and she was telling them a story.

320
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:49,440
He sat outside the cafe and talked for an
hour or more about this and that.

321
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,320
But his eyes never went far from the little
group of children.

322
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,820
At last he asked me: 'Is that girl your schoolteacher?'

323
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,149
I laughed and said: 'No, she's just the shopkeeper's
daughter.

324
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:07,220
She's only sixteen.

325
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,019
She's not much older than a child.'

326
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:16,649
He left the village late in the afternoon
before it got dark.

327
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:20,419
He walked through the water to his boat and
climbed in.

328
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,460
We watched him start the engine.

329
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,890
The boat moved away round the rocks at the
end of the beach.

330
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,480
Everyone in the village stopped what they
were doing.

331
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,429
Anita, too, stopped in her story.

332
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:40,870
Everyone watched the strange thing - a boat
that went without a sail.

333
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,720
Of course, he came back.

334
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,980
I told you, no man could ever forget Anita.

335
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,900
A week or two later his boat arrived again
and the good-looking stranger went to Rodrigo's

336
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,740
shop.

337
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,700
He bought a few things and talked with Rodrigo.

338
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,130
Then he came to the cafe again.

339
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,360
He had a drink and a talk with me.

340
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,279
Then he went off again along the coast.

341
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,129
Soon he came twice a week, on Thursdays and
Sundays.

342
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:18,200
He made friends with the people of the village.

343
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,799
He was exciting and amusing.

344
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,879
He was different from the people of the village.

345
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:28,179
He was a stranger, but everyone seemed to
like him.

346
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,200
We listened to the stories about his travels
and his life in other countries.

347
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,980
He always spent an hour or two at my cafe.

348
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,230
He sat and drank with us and told funny stories.

349
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,110
Many of the fishermen came to the cafe when
he was there.

350
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,320
I liked him, the other men did, too.

351
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,860
He often brought little presents for people.

352
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,739
He brought me a little cassette player one
day.

353
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:59,019
It was something new for us.

354
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:04,239
We had no electricity in the village then,
and we knew very little about the outside

355
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,720
world.

356
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,239
He showed me how it worked.

357
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,489
Then he brought me new batteries for it every
two weeks.

358
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:18,119
He gave me some cassettes for it, too, of
music from the cities, dance music from Latin

359
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,539
America, and Mexican love songs.

360
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:28,169
'A cafe must have music,' he said, 'music
for the customers to enjoy.'

361
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:32,210
After that I kept the little cassette player
on the bar.

362
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,450
Every time the soldier came to the cafe, I
played some music for him.

363
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:43,970
When the cafe was busy, I played music for
the people of the village, too.

364
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,519
He brought a paraffin lamp for Rodrigo to
put in his shop.

365
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,269
It was a very bright light.

366
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:54,730
No house in the village had a light like it.

367
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:00,130
The soldier was becoming very good friends
with Rodrigo.

368
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:07,049
Then early one Monday morning, we heard a
terrible noise from Rodrigo's house.

369
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,299
He was shouting, his wife was screaming, and
the children were all crying.

370
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,919
It seems Anita wasn't in the house.

371
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,960
Her bed was cold and empty.

372
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,440
There was no note from her, not a word.

373
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,620
Rodrigo wanted to get the police.

374
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,559
'Somebody has stolen my daughter,' he said.

375
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,529
'Somebody has taken her away in the night,
dead or alive.'

376
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:39,019
But then they found that her little box was
empty.

377
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,639
Anita's best clothes and favourite things
weren't there.

378
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,020
Even her little story books were gone.

379
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,899
So Rodrigo stopped talking about bringing
the police.

380
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:55,230
For a few days he was terribly angry.

381
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,529
He spoke wildly and fought with everyone.

382
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,520
Nobody could speak to him.

383
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,379
Then, suddenly, he seemed to cut her out of
his life.

384
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,220
He never spoke her name again.

385
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,049
He still doesn't talk about her.

386
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,360
Only a brave man speaks Anita's name in front
of him.

387
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,239
We never saw the soldier again.

388
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:23,029
He was here on the Sunday afternoon and evening.

389
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,769
He usually was.

390
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:29,100
He spent most of the evening in the cafe,
listening to the music.

391
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,820
Then he left at about ten o'clock.

392
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,879
I watched him go out to his boat.

393
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,830
It was dark.

394
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,980
There was no moon.

395
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,620
But I heard him start his engine and go off
to the west.

396
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,759
And the next morning Anita was gone.

397
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,690
And we never saw her or the soldier again.

398
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:58,840
So I - and most people in the village - believe
that she ran away with the soldier.

399
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,960
Nobody knows how they did it.

400
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,169
We never saw him talk to her for a minute
in the village.

401
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,289
I think he waited for her in his boat along
the coast.

402
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,600
And she went to him in the middle of the night.

403
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,950
Most of us believe they are living together
somewhere.

404
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,380
Maybe with their own children now.

405
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,380
***

406
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,570
'But why did Rafael go mad?'

407
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,440
I asked my uncle.

408
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,280
'Who knows?' he replied.

409
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,450
'Perhaps he went mad because he loved Anita.

410
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,129
Then she ran away with the soldier.

411
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:39,710
Who can say?

412
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,070
He did love the girl very much.

413
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,809
I knew it, and his mother did, too.

414
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:52,259
But marriage was impossible because Rafael
was a poor, fatherless fisherman.'

415
00:27:52,259 --> 00:28:00,739
'But a man doesn't go mad for thirteen years
because a girl runs away from home,' I said.

416
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:04,460
'Men often lose their wives, their children.

417
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,220
People die in accidents.

418
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,450
This doesn't make other people crazy.

419
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,179
Rodrigo lost his favourite daughter, the light
of his life, but he didn't go mad.'

420
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,049
'Who can say?' said my uncle again.

421
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,370
'Who knows why things happen?

422
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,549
Why does a man go mad?

423
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,440
We know that Rafael was in love with Anita.

424
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,659
He loved her for a long time before the soldier
came to the village.

425
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:38,690
We know that because of the gold ring.'

426
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,470
'Ah, yes,' I said.

427
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,270
'Tell me about the gold ring that Rafael wears
round his neck.

428
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:55,690
It's clearly a very important part of the
story.'

429
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,100
CHAPTER FIVE
The Gold Ring

430
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,220
Told by my uncle

431
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,900
Rafael (said my uncle) was in love with Anita.

432
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,129
He wanted to marry Anita when she was only
fifteen or sixteen.

433
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:17,429
His mother went to see Rodrigo to talk to
him about it.

434
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:21,009
I heard that Rodrigo was very polite to her.

435
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,370
'I'm sorry,' he said.

436
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,499
'Anita is going to marry a rich businessman
in the city.

437
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:32,980
He's a very rich man and a friend of our family.

438
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,850
Your son Rafael is a fine boy.

439
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,429
But he's too young to get married.

440
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:40,010
And he has nothing to give her.

441
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,770
Nothing at all.'

442
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,110
Rafael was very sad when he heard about Anita
and the businessman.

443
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:55,090
Then, after a few weeks, he suddenly left
the village and went to the port on the coast.

444
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,110
'I'm going to find work in the port,' he said
to his mother.

445
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,730
'I want to see something of the world outside
this village.

446
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,360
I'll come back in a month or two.'

447
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,480
He put his few things in his boat and sailed
along the coast to the port.

448
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,799
It was six months before we saw him again.

449
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,799
***

450
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,950
'Six months?

451
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,440
What did he do there for six months?'

452
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,799
I asked my uncle.

453
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,239
'You're lucky,' he replied.

454
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:30,690
'I can tell you.

455
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,269
Rafael came to the cafe one evening.

456
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:40,270
There were no other customers that night,
and he told me about his time in the port.

457
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,380
This is what he told me.'

458
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
***

459
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,409
Rafael stayed in the port all the time (my
uncle said).

460
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:52,830
He slept in his boat on the beach.

461
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,419
Sometimes he bought fruit and vegetables from
the market after it closed.

462
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,519
They were very cheap then.

463
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,159
He worked for anyone.

464
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,059
He did anything.

465
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,090
He carried things for people.

466
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,809
He loaded and unloaded boats and lorries.

467
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,369
Every morning, very early, he went fishing.

468
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,730
Then he sold the fish on the beach before
he started work.

469
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:23,019
Slowly, very slowly, he began to save some
money.

470
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:25,980
Rafael met an old goldsmith in the town.

471
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,179
He was a good old man.

472
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,889
Rafael helped the goldsmith when he could.

473
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:37,109
He cleaned his shop for him and brought packages
and messages for him.

474
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:40,389
He talked to him and made coffee for him.

475
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:43,629
He watched him while he was working.

476
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:47,519
Soon he became a good friend.

477
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,649
Rafael never took any money from the old man.

478
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:52,909
He never asked for any.

479
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:59,379
Then, one day, the goldsmith asked Rafael
what he wanted.

480
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:01,889
He knew he wanted something.

481
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,090
And Rafael told him.

482
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:11,129
'I want a gold ring for a girl in my village,'
he said.

483
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:18,389
'It must be in the shape of a fish, a long
fish with its tail in its mouth.

484
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:21,039
How much will this ring cost?

485
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,809
I have some money.

486
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,760
I know it's not enough.

487
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,139
But I'll work for you until I've paid for
it.'

488
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:32,799
The old goldsmith made the ring for him.

489
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,179
I'm sure Rafael paid much less than its real
cost.

490
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:42,429
But it took six months of hard work to pay
for it.

491
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:47,529
Soon after Rafael came back to the village,
he went with his mother to see Rodrigo.

492
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:51,429
This time Rafael spoke for himself.

493
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:55,679
'Senor Rodrigo,' he said quietly.

494
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,070
'My father is dead and my mother is poor.

495
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:08,129
But I'm hard-working and honest and I'll be
a good husband to Anita.

496
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:12,659
One day I'll be a rich man, like your friend
in the city.

497
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:17,570
But I'll be a better husband to Anita than
the businessman, because I love her with all

498
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,580
my heart.'

499
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,190
Then he gave the gold ring to Rodrigo as a
present for Anita.

500
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:32,549
Of course, Rodrigo didn't agree to a marriage
between Anita and Rafael.

501
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:35,190
He gave the ring back to Rafael.

502
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,489
'I'm sorry,' he said.

503
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:42,539
'But Anita will marry the businessman in a
year or two.

504
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:47,710
That is decided and I am not going to change
my plans.'

505
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,710
***

506
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,020
'So Anita never got the ring,' I said to my
uncle.

507
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,629
'After all that work and time, he couldn't
give it to her.'

508
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:06,000
'He still has it on a piece of fishing line
round his neck,' my uncle said.

509
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,609
'And when did the soldier come to the village
for the first time?'

510
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:15,589
'A few months after Rafael came back from
the port, perhaps.

511
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:16,909
I can't remember exactly.'

512
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,119
'But Rafael wasn't mad at that time?'

513
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,119
'Oh, no.

514
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,409
Not at all.

515
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,129
In fact he seemed very happy.'

516
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,429
'Tell me about the time when he went mad.

517
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:36,740
Was it the same time exactly when Anita went
away with the soldier, or later?'

518
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,869
'It's difficult to remember.

519
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,419
A lot of things happened at that time.'

520
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,159
'What do you mean?

521
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,179
What kind of things happened?'

522
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:50,690
'Oh, little things, strange things.

523
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,520
Santiago's old donkey disappeared.'

524
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,200
'What do you mean - it disappeared?'

525
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,240
'It did - it went.

526
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,480
It disappeared.

527
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,020
One day it was in the field behind his house.

528
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,860
The next day it wasn't there.

529
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,100
Perhaps Anita stole it to ride on.

530
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,910
But everyone knew Santiago's donkey.

531
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,150
It was too old and weak to walk a hundred
metres.

532
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,950
It couldn't carry a girl.'

533
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,390
'What other strange things happened?'

534
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:30,750
'I remember that on that last night, Rafael
danced.'

535
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,750
'Danced?'

536
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:39,839
'Yes, he danced for hours, alone, here in
the cafe.

537
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,780
He never danced before, not in the cafe or
anywhere.

538
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,010
Or I never saw him dance.

539
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:53,559
And, of course, he never danced again, because
he went crazy.

540
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:59,010
But I must start at the beginning.'

541
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:05,000
CHAPTER SIX
The Night When Rafael Danced

542
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,299
Told by my uncle

543
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:12,410
It was a Sunday (said my uncle).

544
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:18,829
The soldier arrived in his boat in the early
afternoon, when everything was quiet.

545
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:23,780
He lowered his anchor a few metres from the
shore, as usual, and walked up the sand to

546
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,819
the houses.

547
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:28,780
He never pulled his boat up on to the beach.

548
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,470
It was a heavy boat and he didn't want to
break the engine.

549
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:38,299
He always left it in about one metre of water.

550
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,829
That day he came first to the cafe.

551
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,059
He sat and talked with me and some of the
men.

552
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,260
We all sat outside the cafe and listened to
his stories.

553
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:57,160
Then, later in the afternoon, he went to Rodrigo's
shop and bought a few things.

554
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,700
He had a big can of paraffin in the boat for
Rodrigo's new lamp.

555
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,210
I saw him give it to him.

556
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,920
The soldier and Rodrigo sat and talked and
drank coffee outside the shop for about an

557
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,200
hour.

558
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,680
When it got dark, he went with Rodrigo into
the house behind the shop.

559
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,260
I could see the bright light from the lamp
through the window.

560
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,789
Then the soldier had a meal with Rodrigo.

561
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:32,740
After the meal, he came back to the cafe and
sat with me and some of the fishermen.

562
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,430
It was very dark and we sat inside.

563
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,190
The soldier seemed very happy.

564
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,880
He told us a lot of funny stories about his
life as a soldier.

565
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,420
Then, at about nine o'clock, Rafael came into
the cafe.

566
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:56,910
We were surprised to see him, because Rafael
didn't spend a lot of time at the cafe.

567
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,440
And he never came into the cafe when the soldier
was there.

568
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,410
That night he was wearing his best clothes.

569
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:10,079
Usually he wore his old clothes, even in the
cafe.

570
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,880
He was wearing his best shirt and trousers.

571
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:20,390
His face and hands were very clean, and his
hair was still wet and shiny from washing.

572
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:27,940
I asked myself: 'Is he trying to show the
soldier that he is not just a poor fisherman?' 

573
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,490
The soldier knew Rafael.

574
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,130
He knew that he wanted to marry Anita.

575
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,930
Everyone in the village talked about it.

576
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,260
Rafael knew that the soldier was also interested
in her.

577
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,850
Everyone in the village talked about that,
too.

578
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,270
But nobody knew the secret game that the soldier
was playing.

579
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,390
Rafael and the soldier didn't speak.

580
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,330
The cafe was quiet.

581
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,090
Nobody spoke.

582
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,420
Suddenly the soldier took a cassette from
his pocket.

583
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:09,140
'Let's have some music,' he said, giving me
the cassette.

584
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,970
I took it and put it into the player.

585
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,040
I remember it was a love song.

586
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,349
It was sung by a girl with a soft and beautiful
voice.

587
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:24,050
We all sat and listened to it.

588
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,720
Rafael smiled and listened, too. 

589
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,770
When the cassette ended, I put another cassette
in the player.

590
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,270
But the soldier stood up.

591
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,940
'It's getting late,' he said.

592
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,789
'I must go.'

593
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:43,910
He went out into the dark night.

594
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,140
It was about ten o'clock, I think.

595
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,589
His usual time.

596
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:55,039
A few minutes later, we heard the noise when
he started the engine of his boat.

597
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,410
Then the sound of the engine went slowly along
the coast.

598
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,780
Soon everything was quiet again.

599
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,210
We could hear only the sea and the music.

600
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:10,490
The girl on the cassette was singing another
love song.

601
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,750
It was a sad song, slow but strong.

602
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,900
The fishermen and I sat quietly and listened.

603
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:27,039
Suddenly Rafael stood up in the corner of
the cafe and began, very slowly, to dance.

604
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:35,829
Alone in the shadows, his eyes closed, he
moved to the music.

605
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:43,970
He danced, his head back, eyes closed, a strange
half-smile on his face.

606
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,250
We all watched him in surprise.

607
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,039
After a few minutes we laughed and went on
talking.

608
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:58,279
But Rafael went on dancing, dancing alone
for the rest of the evening.

609
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:06,230
Every time the music stopped he looked at
me with big, dark eyes and said, 'Again.'

610
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,410
And I put another cassette in the machine.

611
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:15,700
Then Rafael smiled, closed his eyes, and continued
dancing.

612
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,339
At midnight all the other men went off to
bed.

613
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:24,200
Rafael was still there, still dancing.

614
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,789
I watched the poor boy until the song ended.

615
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,339
Then I switched off the machine.

616
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:34,839
I said good night to him, and sent him home
to bed.

617
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:41,740
Then the next morning, before daylight, we
heard shouting and crying from Rodrigo's house.

618
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,940
The news went round the village like fire.

619
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,029
Anita wasn't there.

620
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:52,260
Rodrigo sent all his family and friends out
to look for her.

621
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,089
They looked along every road, big and small.

622
00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:00,450
They looked in the fields and along the beach,
in the rocks.

623
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,839
Everywhere.

624
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:06,500
Later, Rafael came out of his house with his
mother.

625
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,560
I told them about Anita, and they were very
surprised.

626
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,130
We all were.

627
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,540
Rafael went to his boat immediately.

628
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,859
He planned to sail along the coast and look
for her.

629
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:21,010
He sailed away to the west.

630
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,559
I watched him until I couldn't see him.

631
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:27,609
He sailed round the rocks at the end of the
village.

632
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:31,310
He was looking at the land as he went.

633
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,240
The next time I saw him, he was mad.

634
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,299
Everybody in the village was out looking for
Anita that morning.

635
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:42,630
But nobody found her.

636
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,300
Then Santiago couldn't find his old donkey.

637
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,990
He came to Rodrigo's shop.

638
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,380
He was shouting that Anita took it.

639
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,619
Rodrigo was very angry.

640
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,740
He wanted to hit Santiago and knock him down.

641
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,290
I thought he wanted to kill the old man.

642
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,950
Some friends of Santiago took him away quickly.

643
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,720
After that, he said nothing more about the
donkey.

644
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:17,230
Then, early in the afternoon, some of the
fishermen found Rafael.

645
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:24,050
He was about a kilometre west of the village,
in a quiet place near the high rocks.

646
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:30,279
His boat wasn't far from the shore and Rafael
was lying in the bottom of it.

647
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:32,450
He was wet and dirty.

648
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,960
He was looking up at the sky and laughing.

649
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,950
And he was completely mad.

650
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,590
They brought him and the boat back to the
village.

651
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,510
His mother and I washed him and gave him some
water.

652
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,160
We put him to bed.

653
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,020
But he lay and made noises all night.

654
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,859
He screamed and fought.

655
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,529
He was like a mad animal.

656
00:43:56,529 --> 00:44:00,079
The next day he went out of the house and
sat by his boat.

657
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,460
He looked at the sea all day and said nothing.

658
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,950
We waited, day after day.

659
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,930
We gave him food and drink.

660
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,290
We washed him when we could.

661
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:15,530
But he was like a small child.

662
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,780
We waited for him to get better.

663
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,119
But he never did.

664
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,119
***

665
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,720
'And you never found out what made him mad?'

666
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,350
I asked my uncle.

667
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:30,600
'He never speaks.

668
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,840
Only about the ring.

669
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,210
You know everything that I know now,' he said.

670
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:42,170
'When we were washing the poor boy, we found
the gold ring on a fishing line round his

671
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,859
neck.

672
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,839
When we tried to take it off, he screamed.

673
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:49,569
So we left it there.

674
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:55,520
All these years later, he still wears it round
his neck.

675
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,990
He gave six months of his life to buy that
ring.

676
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:06,780
His present for Anita which she never had.'

677
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,680
CHAPTER SEVEN
Two Visits

678
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:19,210
The next morning, I went with my uncle to
see Rodrigo, the shopkeeper.

679
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,370
He had a fine supermarket now, built of stone.

680
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,020
He still lived in a house behind the shop.

681
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,930
But now the house was two floors high and
had a garden with a wall round it.

682
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:38,079
He also had his own lorry with his name on
it, and there was a new car next to the shop.

683
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,349
It was clear that Rodrigo had plenty of money
now.

684
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:48,039
Inside the supermarket there were all kinds
of tins and packets.

685
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:52,410
There were boxes of fresh fruit and vegetables
outside the door.

686
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:57,880
It was the biggest shop in the village and
it seemed to sell everything.

687
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,950
Rodrigo was a big, heavy man.

688
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,510
He was about fifty years old and he wore a
fine white suit and a white hat.

689
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,510
When we arrived, he was unloading boxes of
tins from the lorry.

690
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,820
He was picking them up, three at a time, and
taking them into the shop.

691
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,180
He was big and fat.

692
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,490
But he was still a very strong man.

693
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,720
He was polite and friendly to my uncle and
me.

694
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,200
He knew I was a doctor.

695
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,410
He invited us into his house.

696
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:33,650
We sat and had coffee and talked about the
changes in the village since my first visit

697
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,970
as a boy.

698
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,480
At last I told him my ideas for helping Rafael.

699
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,960
Then he wasn't so friendly.

700
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,200
'A doctor!' he said.

701
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,819
'He needs more than a doctor.

702
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:52,250
I don't know why he's crazy.

703
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,250
Nobody does.

704
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,760
God knows, I've helped him and his mother
over the years.

705
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,309
I've given them food when they were hungry.

706
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:02,400
And money when they needed it.

707
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,640
His poor mother was a good and hard-working
woman.

708
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,529
Now she's dead.

709
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:10,150
It was a terrible thing to happen to her.

710
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,150
Terrible.

711
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,790
First her young husband was killed by a shark.

712
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,710
Then her only son went crazy and lived on
the beach like an animal.

713
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,029
'Some people say that love made him mad.

714
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:25,369
But you're an intelligent man, doctor.

715
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:27,170
You've studied at university.

716
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:33,340
Does a young man of eighteen years go mad
for love of a girl?

717
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,710
A strong young man in good health?

718
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,510
It's a stupid idea.

719
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,190
I believe he wasn't in good health.

720
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,230
I think he was ill.

721
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,000
I don't know the problem exactly.

722
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,340
You're the doctor.

723
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,060
Help him.

724
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,510
Make him better, if you can.

725
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,609
But look for the facts.

726
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:54,580
Don't listen to people's silly stories.'

727
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:00,900
'So you don't think that your daughter Anita
was the reason for his madness?'

728
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,220
I asked.

729
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,799
Rodrigo didn't look at us.

730
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,410
He looked at the wall for a long time.

731
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:14,319
'I don't have a daughter called Anita,' he
said at last.

732
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,079
'I had one many years ago, but she's dead.'

733
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,710
After that, he said nothing more about Rafael
or Anita.

734
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,489
Soon we thanked him and left.

735
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,489
***

736
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,670
Later that morning, a man came to my uncle's
house.

737
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:35,079
He was small and thin.

738
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,390
He stood at the back door with his hat in
his hands.

739
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,110
When my uncle saw him, he brought him inside.

740
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,619
He found a chair for him and gave him a drink.

741
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:51,069
'This is Luis Valdez,' he said to me.

742
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:53,059
'He's a farmer.

743
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:57,970
He has a farm just outside the village to
the east.'

744
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,920
We sat and talked about farms and the weather.

745
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,170
Then the man began to ask me about Rafael.

746
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:10,420
'Is it true, the story that I hear?' he asked.

747
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,119
'Are you trying to save Rafael, the poor,
crazy boy?'

748
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,519
'I'm a doctor,' I answered.

749
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:22,380
'And yes, I'm interested in Rafael.

750
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,779
I'm trying to find out why he went mad.

751
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:27,289
Perhaps I can make him better.

752
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:28,960
Perhaps not.'

753
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,750
'My wife asked me to talk to you,' he said.

754
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:42,519
'She's Marta, Rodrigo's second daughter and
Anita's younger sister.

755
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:47,000
She says she wants to talk to you about Anita
and Rafael.

756
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,190
But it must be a secret.

757
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:55,420
She knows things that even her father Rodrigo
doesn't know.

758
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,269
She wants to help Rafael.

759
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:03,200
But she doesn't want to make her father angry
or unhappy after all these years.'

760
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,550
'Her secrets will be safe with me,' I said.

761
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,740
'I don't want to make the people in the village
unhappy.

762
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,440
I only want to help Rafael.

763
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,619
If she knows anything about Rafael, I'll be
happy to talk to her.'

764
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:23,319
That evening I went alone to Luis's house.

765
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:35,130
Luis sent his children to bed, and Marta began
to tell me her story.

766
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,660
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Young Princess

767
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,250
Told by Marta

768
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,990
I'm Rodrigo's second daughter (Marta told
me).

769
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,599
I was seven years younger than Anita.

770
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,710
When I was a little girl, it was very strange.

771
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,310
Anita was beautiful; I wasn't.

772
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,730
Anita was clever; I wasn't.

773
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,539
She could read and tell stories, sing and
draw pictures.

774
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:11,430
I couldn't.

775
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,210
I was small, fat and stupid.

776
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,890
But I've been lucky I married a good husband.

777
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:23,200
I have two healthy sons and a pretty daughter.

778
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,390
Now I'm very happy with my life.

779
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:31,230
But I must tell you about my sister Anita.

780
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:34,510
It's true that she was beautiful and clever.

781
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:40,240
But, I'm sorry to say, she wasn't a very good
child.

782
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,850
Not very nice.

783
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,130
Our parents gave her everything she wanted.

784
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,400
She could do anything she liked.

785
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,310
She never worked or helped our mother in the
house.

786
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,869
I remember that her hands were always clean
and beautiful.

787
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:58,180
Her fingernails were long and pink.

788
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:03,039
They were never broken or bitten like mine.

789
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,470
Everyone thought she was beautiful and clever.

790
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,339
Everyone smiled at her.

791
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:11,369
Everyone did what she wanted.

792
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,440
She became proud and lazy.

793
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,529
I remember she told us stories, sitting near
the house.

794
00:52:18,529 --> 00:52:24,400
But her voice was very loud and clear, and
all the people near us could hear her clever

795
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,180
words.

796
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,369
She often sang to herself in the house.

797
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:33,359
But she sang only when there were people outside
to hear her.

798
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,470
I'm sorry.

799
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,700
This isn't important, really.

800
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,180
But she did other things.

801
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,880
Worse things.

802
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,359
We slept in a small room at the back of the
old house.

803
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:50,010
I was only eight or nine years old then.

804
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:55,720
Anita had most of the room for her things,
and I slept in the corner.

805
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,539
One night, I remember, it was very late.

806
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:04,210
Our parents were in their room asleep, and
something woke me up.

807
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,420
I saw Anita going quietly out of the room.

808
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,890
She was wearing a dress and shoes.

809
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,760
The moon was very bright that night, and I
couldn't sleep again.

810
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,710
I lay awake, waiting.

811
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:26,339
About half an hour later, Anita came quietly
back into the room and got into her bed.

812
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,349
'Where have you been?'

813
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:29,869
I asked her.

814
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:32,090
She was very angry, because I was awake.

815
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,670
'Go to sleep, stupid girl,' she said.

816
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,740
'I had stomach-ache.

817
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,740
I only went out for a few minutes.

818
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,250
Don't say anything to anyone.'

819
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,650
I said nothing, but after that I watched her.

820
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,369
I saw her go out on other nights.

821
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:55,930
At last, I asked her where she went.

822
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,089
She laughed quietly.

823
00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:01,480
'I go to meet my prince,' she said.

824
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,650
That was all that she said.

825
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,770
Her head was full of the stories that she
read in her books.

826
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:12,390
She loved stories about princes and princesses.

827
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:18,770
Stories about magic carpets which could fly,
and magic lamps and rings.

828
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:21,849
These were the stories that she told us most
often.

829
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:23,319
She didn't have to read them.

830
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:25,220
She knew them all.

831
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,480
She imagined that she was a beautiful princess
in a story.

832
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,299
She never believed that she was only a shopkeeper's
child.

833
00:54:33,299 --> 00:54:37,040
Perhaps a king gave her to her parents in
secret when she was a baby.

834
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,599
She had many strange and silly ideas in her
head.

835
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,599
***

836
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,160
'But who did she go to see?

837
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,890
Who was this prince?'

838
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,230
I asked Marta.

839
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,579
'It was Rafael, of course,' she replied.

840
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:50,579
'They were in love.

841
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,130
Even when they were little children.

842
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:58,710
She went out at night to the big rocks at
the end of the beach.

843
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,140
Rafael came and met her there.

844
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,039
They sat there in the rocks in the moonlight.

845
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:08,020
They talked about their love and the happy
married life that they planned.

846
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,750
'Our parents had no idea that she was doing
this, of course.

847
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,160
Anita told me to keep quiet about it.

848
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:22,410
"If you tell anyone," she said "I'll say terrible
things about you to our parents.

849
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,450
They'll believe me.

850
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,400
They won't believe you."

851
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,339
And it was true.

852
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:28,789
I knew it was true.

853
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:31,180
They always believed Anita.

854
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,190
'She could always do what she wanted.

855
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,730
I was always in trouble.

856
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,839
So I said nothing.

857
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,910
'Then Rafael went away to work in the port.

858
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,730
For six months, Anita lost her prince.

859
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,509
In the daytime, she was the same as before.

860
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:53,190
But at night she cried in her bed, because
her Rafael was far away.

861
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,319
'But when he came back, she was happy again.

862
00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:00,089
She went to meet him at the big rocks.

863
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:07,280
'After a few days she came back from one of
these meetings with a ring on her finger.

864
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,799
She showed it to me in the moonlight in our
room.

865
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:13,920
It was the gold ring in the shape of a fish.

866
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,089
She was very proud of it.

867
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:18,960
She wore it on her finger when she went to
meet Rafael.

868
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,029
At other times she kept it under the carpet
in our room.'

869
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:28,420
Marta stopped and drank from a glass of water.

870
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,029
I didn't know what to say.

871
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:34,990
This wasn't the same Anita that my uncle described
to me.

872
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,760
'Do you know what happened to Anita?'

873
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,869
I asked.

874
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:41,180
'Do you know where she went that night?

875
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,819
The night she went away?'

876
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:46,740
Marta thought for a few long seconds.

877
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,950
'I can remember what I saw.

878
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,960
And I can remember what I heard, she said.

879
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,180
'I remember all that exactly.

880
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,700
I shall never forget it.

881
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:12,039
But I'm still not sure what happened.'

882
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:16,380
CHAPTER NINE
The True Prince

883
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,230
Told by Marta

884
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:24,250
On that Sunday night (Marta continued), I
went to bed early.

885
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,980
About eight o'clock, I think, like most younger
children.

886
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,560
My father was in the living room.

887
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,960
He was talking to the soldier.

888
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,200
The soldier stayed for a meal that evening.

889
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,819
I could hear their voices through the walls.

890
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:44,170
They had the new paraffin lamp in there with
them, I remember.

891
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,509
It made a bright light in that room.

892
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,910
Anita was in our room, too.

893
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:55,059
Father sent her to bed because the soldier
was there.

894
00:57:55,059 --> 00:58:00,710
She was lying on her bed and reading by the
light of a small oil lamp.

895
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,400
She was listening to the talk in the living
room, too.

896
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:11,250
I remember that we could hear the soldier's
deep voice very clearly through the thin walls.

897
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,230
I think I fell asleep.

898
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:19,259
When I woke up, it was later, but not very
late.

899
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:24,119
The bright light from the lamp was still shining
under the door of the living room.

900
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:26,960
My parents were in there, talking quietly.

901
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,250
But the soldier wasn't there with them.

902
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,529
Anita was taking things out of her box and
putting them in a bag.

903
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:39,319
I sat up and spoke to her.

904
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:41,819
She told me to be quiet.

905
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:46,359
She continued taking her best dresses out
of the box and putting them in the bag.

906
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:50,700
I asked her what she was doing.

907
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,109
'I'm going to meet my true love, my true prince,'
she said.

908
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:57,609
'I'm going away with him.'

909
00:58:57,609 --> 00:59:06,950
She laughed and sang quietly, 'The girl with
the magic ring will always know her true love.'

910
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:10,269
She told me to say nothing.

911
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:16,650
Then she went very quietly to the back door
and went out into the dark night.

912
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:21,339
Her hand quietly pulled the door closed behind
her.

913
00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:26,710
On her middle finger she wore the gold ring
shaped like a fish.

914
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,930
I went to the window and looked out.

915
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:37,130
I was terribly afraid, I knew Anita was a
silly child, but this was very, very wrong.

916
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,309
'If Father finds out, he'll kill her,' I thought.

917
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:45,900
'He gets angry very quickly, and he's very
strong.'

918
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,400
But I was afraid of Anita, too.

919
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,839
So I stood there looking out of the window.

920
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,450
I cried quietly.

921
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,519
There was no moon and it was very dark.

922
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,460
I heard music playing in the cafe along the
beach.

923
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,890
It was a nice song, a slow song.

924
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:11,710
I listened to the music and the soft sound
of the waves on the beach.

925
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:16,290
Soon I felt a little better.

926
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,680
After a long time, I started to feel cold.

927
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,920
So I went back to my bed and fell asleep.

928
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,670
I woke up again much later.

929
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:31,279
The house was dark and quiet.

930
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:33,029
My parents were asleep.

931
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,869
Nobody was talking anywhere in the house.

932
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:39,059
Anita's bed was still empty.

933
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:42,212
I went to the window again.

934
01:00:42,212 --> 01:00:45,600
The moon was up and I could see the houses
along the beach.

935
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:51,329
There was still a light in the cafe and music
playing.

936
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:53,080
I went back to bed.

937
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,470
I cried until I fell asleep.

938
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:01,240
I hoped that it was all a bad dream.

939
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,920
When I woke again, the first grey light of
the new day was in the room.

940
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,349
Anita's bed was still empty.

941
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:15,359
I lay in bed with my eyes closed until my
mother came to wake us.

942
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,680
When she found Anita's empty bed, she started
to shout and scream.

943
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,910
Then I opened my eyes.

944
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,279
I soon started to cry, too.

945
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:28,200
I never told them where she went.

946
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,060
Or what she said.

947
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:34,529
There was terrible shouting and crying in
our house that day.

948
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:38,609
But we never saw Anita again.

949
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:39,609
***

950
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:44,089
'So you think she went to see Rafael that
night?'

951
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:45,569
I said slowly.

952
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:48,529
'Oh, no,' said Marta.

953
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:52,130
'I think she went to meet the soldier, Carlos.

954
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,250
That's why she called him her true prince.

955
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,960
He was like someone in a story, you see.

956
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,930
First the beautiful princess falls in love
with a poor fisherman.

957
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:10,089
Then either he turns into a handsome prince,
or a real prince comes along and takes her

958
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:11,780
away to his palace.

959
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,960
I'm afraid Anita was quite a silly girl, really.

960
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,359
She lived the stories in her head.

961
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:24,059
After the soldier came to the village, she
started to meet him at night.

962
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:26,619
She went to the same place in the rocks.

963
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:30,930
But she was meeting the soldier, not Rafael.

964
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,740
She went there many times.

965
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:38,310
Then, that night, she didn't come back.

966
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:41,410
She went away with him in his boat.

967
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:47,140
In those days, perhaps, a boat with an engine
was like a magic carpet.'

968
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:51,460
'But she was wearing the gold ring when she
went?

969
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,380
I said.

970
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:59,579
'Yes, she took all her best things: dresses,
her story books, and the ring.'

971
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,910
'But Rafael has that ring.

972
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,460
He has worn it round his neck for more than
thirteen years.'

973
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,940
'I know,' she said.

974
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,450
'I think she spoke to Rafael that night.

975
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,619
I think she told him her plans.

976
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:22,259
Then she gave him his ring and went off to
meet the soldier somewhere along the coast.'

977
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:24,780
'Is that what you really think?'

978
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,799
I asked.

979
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:28,450
'Yes,' said Marta.

980
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:32,680
'She said goodbye to Rafael and gave him his
ring.

981
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,930
Then she went to meet the soldier.

982
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:38,500
That's what made Rafael mad.

983
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:44,269
He went to look for her the next day, but
all the time he had the ring round his neck.

984
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:45,839
He wanted her to come back.

985
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,240
Or he wanted her father to find her and bring
her back.

986
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,880
But she never came.

987
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,200
And when she didn't come, Rafael went mad.

988
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,680
When you talk to Rafael, what does he say?'

989
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:08,680
'He holds the ring, and says, "She gave me
the ring," or "She gave me the golden fish",'

990
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,680
I answered

991
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,680
'Exactly,' said Marta.

992
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,640
'First she took his ring and said, "I love
you."

993
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,799
Then she gave it back to him and went away
with the soldier.

994
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,109
That's what made the poor man crazy.'

995
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:29,599
'What was so special about the ring?'

996
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,099
I asked.

997
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:34,099
'What did Anita say?

998
01:04:34,099 --> 01:04:36,400
Something about a magic ring?'

999
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,099
'The girl with the magic ring will always
know her true love.

1000
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:45,460
It was in her story,' said Marta.

1001
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,660
'Her own story.

1002
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,609
She wrote it herself.

1003
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:52,690
It wasn't a story that she read in a book.

1004
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,589
It was her favourite story.

1005
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:56,530
She told it to us hundreds of times.'

1006
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:00,740
'And it was about a magic ring?'

1007
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,850
'Yes.

1008
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:05,039
In fact, I have the story here.

1009
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,700
Anita wrote it in a notebook and I kept it.

1010
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,359
It's the only thing of Anita's that I have.

1011
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:16,170
I can't read it, of course, but it's that
story.'

1012
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:22,970
Marta went into another room and came back
with a small, thin notebook.

1013
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,609
She carried it carefully in both hands.

1014
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:28,520
She put it on the table in front of me.

1015
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,579
It was a cheap school writing book.

1016
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:35,369
The pages were yellow with age.

1017
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:37,740
There was only one story in it.

1018
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:43,250
It was called 'The Ring of the Golden Fish'.

1019
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,579
The story was short.

1020
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:50,440
It was written in pencil in the large, clear
writing of a young child.

1021
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,509
Luis and Marta looked at me.

1022
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:56,730
I realized they were waiting.

1023
01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:05,069
They wanted to hear me read the story to them.

1024
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:12,089
CHAPTER TEN
'The Ring of the Golden Fish'

1025
01:06:12,089 --> 01:06:15,740
This is the story that I read to Marta and
her husband.

1026
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:22,119
The story that was written by Anita all those
years ago.

1027
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:27,650
A long time ago, there was a beautiful princess.

1028
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,390
She lived in a beautiful palace with big,
beautiful gardens all round it.

1029
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:36,630
But she was sad because she had no friends.

1030
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,789
She couldn't talk to anyone or play with anyone.

1031
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:45,960
She was a prisoner in the palace because she
was so beautiful.

1032
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,180
Her father wanted her to marry a rich, handsome
prince.

1033
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:54,619
But the princes in that country weren't handsome.

1034
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:57,810
And the rich men weren't princes.

1035
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:01,900
And the handsome men weren't princes or rich.

1036
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,089
So she married nobody, and she was very sad.

1037
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:13,240
One day, a poor fisherman came to the beach
at the end of the palace gardens.

1038
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:17,950
The gardens were very big and went as far
as the sea.

1039
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:23,210
The fisherman caught a big golden fish and
he wanted to kill it.

1040
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:27,069
But it was a magic fish and it spoke to him.

1041
01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:34,890
'Don't kill me,' it said, 'and I'll give you
a magic ring.

1042
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,440
And with this ring you can marry the princess.'

1043
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:45,060
So the handsome young fisherman put the fish
back into the sea.

1044
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:49,210
Soon it came back with a gold ring in its
mouth.

1045
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:57,769
'The man with this magic ring will always
know his true love,' said the fish.

1046
01:07:57,769 --> 01:08:02,509
And it swam away to the bottom of the sea.

1047
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:05,309
The handsome young fisherman was called Roberto.

1048
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:11,430
(Here the name Rafael was written first and
then changed.)

1049
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:17,890
When Roberto put on the ring, he saw in his
head a picture of the princess.

1050
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,299
He fell in love with her.

1051
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:25,259
He walked through the gardens to the palace,
looking for the princess.

1052
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:30,250
When he found her in the garden, he put the
magic ring on her finger.

1053
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:34,420
And she knew immediately that she loved the
handsome young fisherman.

1054
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:41,289
They went to her father, the king, and he
gave the poor fisherman half his lands.

1055
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:46,739
And they were married and lived happily forever.

1056
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:49,759
It wasn't really a very good story.

1057
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,369
It borrowed a lot from other stories.

1058
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:56,370
But it told me a lot about poor Anita.

1059
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:03,380
It told me why Rafael suddenly decided to
work in the port for six months.

1060
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:09,489
It told me why he brought her a gold ring
in the shape of a fish.

1061
01:09:09,489 --> 01:09:12,489
I went back to my uncle's house.

1062
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:17,650
It was late at night, but I sat with him and
drank coffee.

1063
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:21,420
My head was full of changing ideas.

1064
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,980
I said very little, but I thought a lot.

1065
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:31,250
'Have you learned anything important or useful?'
asked my uncle.

1066
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,101
'I don't know,' I said.

1067
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:38,040
'I can't tell you what Marta told me.

1068
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,420
I promised to keep it a secret.

1069
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:45,299
But are you sure about what you told me?

1070
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:48,890
You haven't made any mistakes?'

1071
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:52,040
My uncle thought for a few seconds.

1072
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,940
'Yes, I'm sure.

1073
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:00,420
I haven't forgotten anything important,' he
said.

1074
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,870
'Did Rafael really come to the cafe when the
soldier was still there?

1075
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:06,980
Are you sure about that?'

1076
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,600
'Oh yes.

1077
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,840
I'm sure.

1078
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,380
I remember how they looked.

1079
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,400
Rafael was clean and fine in his best clothes.

1080
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,830
The soldier was sitting at the table with
his friends round him.

1081
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:24,190
But he was looking at Rafael all the time.

1082
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:27,290
They were like two dogs, looking for a fight.'

1083
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:33,870
'And Rafael stayed in the cafe and danced
until late at night.

1084
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,489
And you were with him all that time.'

1085
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:41,880
'I was with the poor boy all the time until
nearly midnight.

1086
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,510
Then I closed the cafe and sent him home.'

1087
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:49,780
'Then how did Anita give him the ring?'

1088
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,030
I asked myself.

1089
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:57,810
'She didn't leave the house until the music
was playing in the cafe.

1090
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:02,400
And at that time she had the ring on her hand.

1091
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,540
And Rafael was already in the cafe with the
soldier.

1092
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:16,820
And he stayed there until midnight, about
two hours after the soldier left in his boat.'

1093
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:22,570
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Rosa's Promise

1094
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,840
That night I slept badly.

1095
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,130
Poor Rafael with his mad eyes came into my
dreams many times.

1096
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,699
He was holding the gold ring.

1097
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:38,590
He was showing it to me and asking me to help
him.

1098
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:42,220
The next morning I sat outside my uncle's
house.

1099
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,520
I looked out at the calm blue sea.

1100
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,710
I was very tired and unhappy.

1101
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:52,650
Soon my uncle came out and sat with me.

1102
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:56,510
His wife Rosa brought out coffee and eggs
for us.

1103
01:11:56,510 --> 01:12:01,070
'What will you do now?' asked my uncle.

1104
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:03,730
'I don't know.

1105
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,710
I still don't know why Rafael went mad.

1106
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,989
I still don't know when exactly.

1107
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:15,260
I can't believe that a man can go crazy for
love of a girl.

1108
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,280
You say Anita was very beautiful.

1109
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:22,570
But a strong young man doesn't go mad for
love.

1110
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,550
Rodrigo is right.

1111
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:27,179
I can't explain it.

1112
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:31,380
But I'm sure it was something more strange,
more terrible.

1113
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,650
There is a reason, but I haven't found it.

1114
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,940
I think nobody here in the village knows it.'

1115
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:45,170
'So, what will you do?' asked my uncle again.

1116
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:49,350
'I'll take Rafael to the hospital in the capital.

1117
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:52,880
If you help me, I'll give him some medicine.

1118
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,900
Then he'll go to sleep.

1119
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,610
When he's in hospital, I can begin to help
him.

1120
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,130
I believe something terrible happened to him.

1121
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,360
I don't mean when Anita ran away with the
soldier.

1122
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:14,320
I mean something really terrible, something
strange and frightening.

1123
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,120
Rafael is afraid to remember it.

1124
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,699
That's why he's mad.

1125
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:22,210
At the hospital I can give him modern medicines.

1126
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:26,380
They'll help him to sleep and to feel happy.

1127
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,780
Then perhaps he'll remember what happened
to him.

1128
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:34,989
If he can remember, he'll get better.'

1129
01:13:34,989 --> 01:13:37,920
Rosa was standing in the door.

1130
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,820
She came to me and took my hand.

1131
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:43,110
She looked into my face.

1132
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:48,610
Her eyes were full of tears and she looked
terribly afraid.

1133
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:51,820
'Please don't take Rafael to hospital,' she
said.

1134
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,699
'Leave him here in the village with us.

1135
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:57,389
He'll be all right with us.'

1136
01:13:57,389 --> 01:13:58,389
I was surprised.

1137
01:13:58,389 --> 01:14:01,290
There were tears in her eyes.

1138
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:04,670
She really was very worried and afraid.

1139
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,050
I thought it was the hospital.

1140
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,080
Village people are often afraid of hospitals.

1141
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,969
They believe that people only go to hospitals
to die.

1142
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:18,140
'Please don't worry, Aunt Rosa,' I said calmly.

1143
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,260
'I won't hurt him.

1144
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,030
I really think I can help him to remember.

1145
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:28,320
With God's help, perhaps I can make him better.'

1146
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,090
'He mustn't remember,' she cried.

1147
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,600
'He's mad because of his crime.

1148
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,890
He went mad because of the terrible thing
that he did.

1149
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,760
He mustn't remember.

1150
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,010
If he remembers, he'll die.'

1151
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,280
My uncle and I looked at Rosa.

1152
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,360
We were very surprised.

1153
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,219
Her face was red and tears were running down
her face.

1154
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:58,449
'What do you know about Rafael's madness?'
asked my uncle quietly.

1155
01:14:58,449 --> 01:15:00,570
'I'm sure you know something.

1156
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,500
Tell us now.'

1157
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,980
Rosa put her wet face in her hands.

1158
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,440
'I promised poor Clara not to tell,' she cried.

1159
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,469
'I promised her on her death bed.

1160
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:23,070
But if you leave her poor son here with us,
I'll tell you.'

1161
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,500
Rosa dried her eyes.

1162
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,960
She sat on the steps in front of the house.

1163
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,000
She didn't look at us.

1164
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,900
She looked out at the sea all the time as
she told her story.

1165
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:44,650
'I sat with his mother, my sister, when she
was very ill five years ago.

1166
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:50,320
Before she died, I promised to be a mother
to her poor, mad son.'

1167
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,460
'We know that,' said my uncle.

1168
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:55,020
'You and I agreed to look after him.

1169
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,180
And we have.

1170
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:01,800
But what did she tell you about why Rafael
went mad?'

1171
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,889
Rosa put her face in her hands.

1172
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:08,000
'Please don't tell anyone,' she cried.

1173
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,679
'I promised to keep her secret forever.'

1174
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:16,210
'We promise,' I said.

1175
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,480
'What secret?'

1176
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,630
'The secret of Rafael's madness,' said Rosa.

1177
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:26,760
'His mother knew it.

1178
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,060
But she kept his secret from everyone.

1179
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:37,820
He was mad because he did a terrible thing.

1180
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:43,800
He did it for love, from hate, the poor, poor
boy.'

1181
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,630
'What did he do?'

1182
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:49,949
'He killed a man.

1183
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:52,070
He took another man's life.

1184
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:55,310
The worst crime of all.

1185
01:16:55,310 --> 01:17:01,570
He murdered the soldier, because of his love
for Anita.'

1186
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,989
'He did what?

1187
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:06,580
But that's impossible!'

1188
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,920
shouted my uncle.

1189
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,280
'That's what Clara told me,' said Rosa.

1190
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:18,810
'She told me everything only hours before
she died.

1191
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:22,720
She couldn't meet God with that secret in
her heart.'

1192
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,690
'But how?

1193
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:25,690
When?'

1194
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:29,640
I asked her quietly.

1195
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,969
'Did she say?'

1196
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:38,440
'I'll tell you what Clara told me,' said Rosa.

1197
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,590
'Her words are written in fire on my heart.

1198
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:48,949
I'll never forget them.'

1199
01:17:48,949 --> 01:17:54,510
CHAPTER TWELVE
A Terrible Secret

1200
01:17:54,510 --> 01:18:00,170
Told to Rosa by Clara

1201
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:05,449
It happened that Sunday evening (said Clara).

1202
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:08,440
It was the evening before Anita went away.

1203
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:14,160
I cooked some fish and rice for myself and
Rafael.

1204
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:21,639
Soon it was ready, but Rafael was out in his
boat.

1205
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:25,250
He often went out soon after it was dark.

1206
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:30,560
That day he was out for more than an hour.

1207
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,670
Then I heard his boat come on to the beach
near our house.

1208
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:39,540
As you know, the house stands alone at the
end of the village.

1209
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:49,230
But still Rafael didn't come to the house,
and the food was getting cold and dry.

1210
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:56,460
So I took the small oil lamp from my kitchen
and I went down to the sea to find him.

1211
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,489
The boat was half on the sand and half in
the water.

1212
01:19:00,489 --> 01:19:04,219
Rafael was standing next to it.

1213
01:19:04,219 --> 01:19:06,900
He was washing the inside of the boat.

1214
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,690
There was a lot of water in the bottom of
it.

1215
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:15,090
I came near with the small lamp.

1216
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:19,480
The light shone on Rafael and the boat.

1217
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:24,699
He was very wet - his head and hair, his clothes.

1218
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:27,340
The water was running down him.

1219
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:31,640
Then I saw something terrible.

1220
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,860
There was blood on Rafael's clothes.

1221
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,550
Blood in his hair.

1222
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,000
Blood running down his face.

1223
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,690
His wet shirt and trousers were covered in
it.

1224
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:47,330
There was fresh blood on his hands, red in
the light of the lamp.

1225
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,650
'God save us!'

1226
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,040
I said.

1227
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,820
'What's happened?'

1228
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,520
'I'm all right, mother,' he answered.

1229
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,200
'Don't be afraid.

1230
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:02,050
But I've killed the stranger who came here
to steal my true love.'

1231
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:10,570
Then I saw that all the water m the bottom
of the boat was dark with blood.

1232
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:13,420
I put out the lamp immediately.

1233
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:16,840
There was no moon and the night was dark.

1234
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,080
I looked round at the empty beach.

1235
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:25,230
'Take off those clothes,' I said quietly.

1236
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:29,250
'Wash yourself in the sea until you're clean.

1237
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:33,409
Then go to the house and put on clean clothes.

1238
01:20:33,409 --> 01:20:37,340
Go quickly to the cafe, so people can see
you.

1239
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,090
I'll wash your clothes and the boat.

1240
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:42,940
Nobody will know what you've done.

1241
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:47,790
If the soldier stops coming here, people won't
be very surprised.

1242
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,739
The man was a stranger.

1243
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:52,239
He had no family or close friends.'

1244
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:56,889
Rafael did what 1 told him.

1245
01:20:56,889 --> 01:21:02,060
He went to the cafe and stayed there all that
evening.

1246
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:06,239
While he was there, I washed the boat.

1247
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:12,840
Then I washed his shirt and trousers many
times, until you couldn't see the blood.

1248
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,840
***

1249
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:22,520
'Oh, Rosa, my dear wife,' said my uncle quietly.

1250
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:30,699
'Have you kept this dark secret in your heart
all these years since Clara died?'

1251
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:32,699
'I promised her.

1252
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:37,510
She asked me before she died,' cried Rosa.

1253
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:42,820
'She was as mad as her son!' said my uncle
angrily.

1254
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:48,260
'We know the soldier ate with Rodrigo in his
house that evening.

1255
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,949
Then he came straight to the cafe.

1256
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:53,820
I saw him and talked to him.

1257
01:21:53,820 --> 01:22:00,400
He left the cafe, alive and well, about an
hour later I heard him leave the village in

1258
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,650
his boat.

1259
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:06,699
More important, Rafael was with me in the
cafe when the soldier left.

1260
01:22:06,699 --> 01:22:10,989
Yes, he was wearing his best clothes and he
was very clean.

1261
01:22:10,989 --> 01:22:16,920
But when Rafael came into the cafe, the soldier
was sitting there, alive.

1262
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,920
I promise you.'

1263
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:24,969
'Perhaps he followed the soldier in his boat
when he left that night.

1264
01:22:24,969 --> 01:22:29,170
Perhaps he killed him on the sea later,' said
Rosa.

1265
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:33,050
'Clara didn't remember the time exactly.'

1266
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:35,449
'Impossible,' said my uncle.

1267
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:40,090
'Rafael stayed in the cafe with me and a lot
of other men.

1268
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,400
He was dancing to the music.

1269
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,310
He didn't leave the cafe for about two hours.

1270
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:48,969
And Rafael couldn't catch the Soldier's boat.

1271
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,380
It had an engine.

1272
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,820
It was a very fast boat.'

1273
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:56,420
'He killed someone,' said Rosa.

1274
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:59,409
And he thought it was the soldier.

1275
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:01,950
I don't know who he killed.

1276
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:04,469
But that's what his good mother told me.

1277
01:23:04,469 --> 01:23:06,710
I must believe her.

1278
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:10,170
Perhaps Rafael thought he killed the soldier.

1279
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:15,449
Then later he saw him in the cafe and went
mad.

1280
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,449
It was still a terrible crime.

1281
01:23:18,449 --> 01:23:21,540
Perhaps that's why he went crazy.

1282
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,260
But who did he kill?

1283
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:27,849
No, it's impossible.'

1284
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:31,280
Rosa ran into the house, crying.

1285
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:35,739
My uncle and I looked at the empty blue sea.

1286
01:23:35,739 --> 01:23:38,179
We didn't speak for a long time.

1287
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:43,160
There was food on the table, but we didn't
feel very hungry.

1288
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,860
'Is it possible?'

1289
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,159
I asked at last.

1290
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:50,210
'What?

1291
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:53,869
That Rafael killed somebody by mistake.

1292
01:23:53,869 --> 01:23:54,869
No.

1293
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:56,429
It's not possible.'

1294
01:23:56,429 --> 01:24:00,810
'But his mother's story...'

1295
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:03,550
'Listen!' said my uncle.

1296
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:06,910
'I'm not stupid.

1297
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:11,920
When Rafael came into the cafe, he saw the
soldier.

1298
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,790
He didn't look surprised.

1299
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,440
He didn't even look angry.

1300
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:20,730
They both listened to the music for about
an hour.

1301
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,000
Rafael was happy.

1302
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,550
He was smiling and dancing.'

1303
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:27,599
'All right,' I said.

1304
01:24:27,599 --> 01:24:29,540
'I believe you.

1305
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,300
I believe everybody.

1306
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:40,020
But this mystery is going to make me crazy
soon.'

1307
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:46,330
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
In the Hospital

1308
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:50,830
All that morning my head went round and round.

1309
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:53,790
It was all impossible.

1310
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:58,150
I took a notebook and wrote some questions
in it.

1311
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:01,219
I still have that notebook with me.

1312
01:25:01,219 --> 01:25:08,219
Sometimes, when I start feeling very proud
of myself, I read it.

1313
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:12,900
Question 1: Did Rafael kill someone?

1314
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:17,030
Is that why he went mad?

1315
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:19,290
His mother thought he did.

1316
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:22,690
She saw him covered in blood.

1317
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:25,969
But who did he kill?

1318
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:28,530
Not the soldier.

1319
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:33,699
He left the cafe when Rafael was still in
it with my uncle.

1320
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:35,880
Not Anita.

1321
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,739
She was with her sister until the music started
in the cafe.

1322
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:44,860
And Rafael was inside the cafe then.

1323
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:49,190
So who?

1324
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:51,360
Impossible!

1325
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:58,560
Question 2: Was the soldier killed, or did
he only go away?

1326
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,290
If he was killed, who killed him?

1327
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,100
Not Rafael.

1328
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:08,650
He was in the cafe until midnight.

1329
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:10,429
Not Anita.

1330
01:26:10,429 --> 01:26:13,940
She was a child, and loved him.

1331
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,340
Who could kill him?

1332
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:20,369
He was a strong young man, a soldier.

1333
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:24,640
And he was friendly with everyone in the village.

1334
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,349
Impossible!

1335
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:36,480
Question 3: Did Anita run away with the soldier,
or was she killed, too?

1336
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:40,210
If she was killed, who killed her?

1337
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:42,610
Not Rafael.

1338
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,110
He loved her.

1339
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:48,320
And he was in the cafe all evening.

1340
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,770
Perhaps the soldier, and he then ran away.

1341
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:53,980
But why?

1342
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:58,970
He loved her and wanted to marry her.

1343
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:05,840
And if the soldier killed her; why did Rafael
go mad?

1344
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,250
Impossible!

1345
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:13,630
I read all my notes and questions again and
again.

1346
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:17,570
Everything seemed impossible.

1347
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:22,199
Suddenly I looked at them again.

1348
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:27,850
There was someone in the village who was big
enough and strong enough.

1349
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:31,050
Someone who could kill the soldier.

1350
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:34,560
He had a good reason to kill him.

1351
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:40,380
There was someone who had a good reason to
kill Anita, too.

1352
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,760
Perhaps he saw her leaving the house with
her bag that night.

1353
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:53,610
Perhaps he followed her along the dark and
empty beach, quietly through the soft sand.

1354
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:57,420
Perhaps he saw her meet the soldier.

1355
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:03,510
Perhaps he killed both of them and put their
dead bodies deep in the sea.

1356
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:09,050
There was another man who loved Anita.

1357
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:13,429
And that man could kill her for running away.

1358
01:28:13,429 --> 01:28:17,530
He was big enough and strong enough to kill
the soldier.

1359
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:23,390
That man was Rodrigo, her father.

1360
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:29,539
But then the wrong man was mad.

1361
01:28:29,539 --> 01:28:30,539
***

1362
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:34,530
I am a doctor, not a policeman or a detective.

1363
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:40,710
I believed I was a clever man, more intelligent
than the people of the village.

1364
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:43,780
I was too proud of myself.

1365
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:50,179
I told my uncle and all the people of the
village about my plans to help poor Rafael.

1366
01:28:50,179 --> 01:28:56,780
I, the great doctor from the university in
the city, could make him well again.

1367
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:59,750
I was too proud.

1368
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:04,130
I spent a week in the village and I talked
to a lot of people.

1369
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:09,020
But I still knew nothing about Rafael's madness.

1370
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:15,429
I still had no idea what happened to the soldier
or Anita.

1371
01:29:15,429 --> 01:29:19,090
I couldn't be sure that Rodrigo killed them.

1372
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:21,380
It was a stupid idea.

1373
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:24,590
I didn't really believe it.

1374
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:29,610
I promised Rosa and Marta to tell nobody what
they told me.

1375
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:32,349
It was our secret.

1376
01:29:32,349 --> 01:29:36,260
I went back to my hospital to do my work.

1377
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:38,750
I wasn't so proud.

1378
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:42,930
I decided not to think about what happened
in the village.

1379
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:48,510
It wasn't a good idea to try to change things.

1380
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:49,510
***

1381
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:53,480
I heard nothing from my uncle or anyone in
the village for almost a year.

1382
01:29:53,480 --> 01:30:00,739
I often dreamt of Rafael and his gold ring
when I was very tired.

1383
01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:03,360
But I never went back to the village.

1384
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,950
I didn't want to meet those good people.

1385
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:11,469
I was sure they didn't have a good opinion
of me now.

1386
01:30:11,469 --> 01:30:17,860
Then, one day, a fisherman brought a note
to the hospital.

1387
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,800
It was written by Rodrigo, the shopkeeper.

1388
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,580
It said:

1389
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,739
Rafael is very ill.

1390
01:30:25,739 --> 01:30:28,400
We think he's dying.

1391
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,890
Please come immediately.

1392
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:33,100
Only you can help us.

1393
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,840
Please come.

1394
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:42,070
Remember my dear daughter Anita and poor,
mad Rafael and help us.

1395
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,340
Your uncle asked me to write this letter.

1396
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:48,030
But I want you to come, too.

1397
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:54,679
Perhaps at last we can find out what really
happened to my daughter all those many years

1398
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:56,960
ago.

1399
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,230
Rodrigo Garcia

1400
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:06,369
I took a small ambulance from the hospital
and went to the village.

1401
01:31:06,369 --> 01:31:09,159
I was there in a few hours.

1402
01:31:09,159 --> 01:31:12,619
I went straight to my uncle's house.

1403
01:31:12,619 --> 01:31:15,710
Rafael was there, lying on a bed.

1404
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:20,210
Rosa was putting cold wet cloths on his head.

1405
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,280
Rafael was very thin and yellow.

1406
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,080
When I came into the room, he coughed weakly.

1407
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,119
Blood ran from his mouth.

1408
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:33,130
Rosa washed away the blood with another cloth.

1409
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:36,130
It was already red with Rafael's blood.

1410
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:40,780
'It's tuberculosis,' I said immediately.

1411
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:43,570
'He's very ill.'

1412
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:47,040
'Yes, I know,' said my uncle.

1413
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,659
'That's why I asked you to come.

1414
01:31:50,659 --> 01:31:52,440
It's very bad.

1415
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:56,370
I don't think there's any hope for him.'

1416
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:58,599
'I'll take him to the hospital,' I said.

1417
01:31:58,599 --> 01:32:02,240
'I've got an ambulance with me.

1418
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:07,560
With medicines and nursing, perhaps we can
still save him.

1419
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,150
But there's not much hope for him.

1420
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:10,280
He's very weak.'

1421
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:18,440
We put Rafael in the ambulance and I took
him back to the hospital in the city.

1422
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,780
He was almost dead.

1423
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:24,260
We washed him and cut his hair and beard.

1424
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:27,300
We put him in a clean bed and gave him medicines.

1425
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:31,260
I sat by his bed for eight hours.

1426
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,060
He didn't move.

1427
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,900
He lay like a dead man.

1428
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,310
His body temperature was very high.

1429
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:45,460
Then, very slowly, it began to fall, and he
fell into a quiet sleep.

1430
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:50,949
Two days later, he opened his eyes.

1431
01:32:50,949 --> 01:32:55,050
He was still having medicines and he was very
weak.

1432
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:56,619
He lay without moving.

1433
01:32:56,619 --> 01:32:59,869
Only his eyes moved.

1434
01:32:59,869 --> 01:33:05,020
He looked round the strange white walls, at
the plastic bottle above his head.

1435
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:08,840
He looked at me in my white coat at his side.

1436
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,929
'Am I dead?' he asked, very quietly.

1437
01:33:13,929 --> 01:33:17,020
'No, Rafael,' I said.

1438
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:22,570
'You're in hospital I'm a doctor.

1439
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:27,270
Miguel, the owner of the cafe in your village,
is my uncle.

1440
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,389
Don't be afraid.

1441
01:33:29,389 --> 01:33:34,219
We're trying to make you well again.'

1442
01:33:34,219 --> 01:33:38,909
His mouth moved in a tired smile, and he fell
asleep again.

1443
01:33:38,909 --> 01:33:43,360
I brought a nurse to sit by his bed.

1444
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,699
'Tell me if he wakes up.

1445
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:49,360
Or if he gets worse,' I said. 

1446
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,429
Then I went to my room in the hospital and
fell on the bed.

1447
01:33:53,429 --> 01:33:56,440
I was asleep in a few seconds.

1448
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,000
There was little hope for poor Rafael.

1449
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,369
He was thin and weak after all the years that
he lived on the beach.

1450
01:34:03,369 --> 01:34:06,610
For years he ate very little.

1451
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:09,710
He slept on the cold, hard ground.

1452
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:12,470
The tuberculosis was very bad.

1453
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:15,980
He was very, very ill.

1454
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:19,890
But he wasn't mad.

1455
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:21,610
He could speak very little.

1456
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:25,520
Most of the time he was very tired.

1457
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:31,710
But when he spoke to me, his words were clear
and calm.

1458
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:35,070
He lived for six days in the hospital.

1459
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:37,920
He slept, he woke.

1460
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,400
And when he was awake, he talked to me.

1461
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,699
Coughing blood, he told me everything.

1462
01:34:44,699 --> 01:34:50,290
Then, on the sixth day, he fell quietly asleep.

1463
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:55,170
And after a few hours his heart stopped and
he was dead.

1464
01:34:55,170 --> 01:35:00,710
After his long years of pain and madness,
I was happy that his death was quiet and easy

1465
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,969
at the end.

1466
01:35:02,969 --> 01:35:07,070
He did a terrible thing, a terrible crime.

1467
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:12,270
But he paid for it with long years of madness.

1468
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:14,670
I have written his story down here.

1469
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:18,280
One day, perhaps, people will read it.

1470
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:22,889
But not until all the people in it are dead.

1471
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:30,300
Until that day, it must stay a secret.

1472
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:36,110
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Murder

1473
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:40,520
This is what Rafael told me:

1474
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,540
Rafael always loved Anita.

1475
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:46,599
He couldn't remember a time when he didn't.

1476
01:35:46,599 --> 01:35:52,079
It was a small village and the children always
played on the beach.

1477
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,619
Anita and the other girls watched the fishermen.

1478
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:59,739
The men cleaned their boats and mended their
nets.

1479
01:35:59,739 --> 01:36:04,110
Rafael fell in love with Anita when they were
still children.

1480
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:07,949
He loved her, and she loved him.

1481
01:36:07,949 --> 01:36:10,300
Or she always said so.

1482
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,469
But her father wanted her to marry a rich
man.

1483
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:17,739
A fat old man, perhaps, old and ugly.

1484
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:22,619
But he must be rich and important.

1485
01:36:22,619 --> 01:36:27,880
Rafael could do nothing to change Rodrigo's
plans.

1486
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:32,900
There was a place in the rocks at the end
of the beach to the west.

1487
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,920
The children often played in it.

1488
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,440
It was like a little house in the rocks.

1489
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:43,510
In the evenings, Rafael sometimes met Anita
there.

1490
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:49,469
She came out of her house very quietly and
ran to their secret place in the rocks.

1491
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:54,040
There she and Rafael talked for a few golden
minutes.

1492
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:59,320
Then she ran home again, afraid of her father.

1493
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,800
Anita was only fifteen years old at that time.

1494
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,790
But her head was full of the stories in her
books.

1495
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:12,489
She was sure she was in love with the handsome
young fisherman.

1496
01:37:12,489 --> 01:37:15,400
Rafael brought her the gold ring.

1497
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,310
It was like the magic ring in her story.

1498
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:21,880
Her father didn't accept it from Rafael.

1499
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:28,090
But Rafael gave it to Anita in secret, when
they met later in their secret place in the

1500
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:29,090
rocks.

1501
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:32,699
The ring was the promise of their love.

1502
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:34,849
She wore it when she was with him.

1503
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:42,270
At other times she kept it in her room, in
the secret place under the carpet.

1504
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:45,489
But then the soldier came to the village.

1505
01:37:45,489 --> 01:37:47,949
He was an older man.

1506
01:37:47,949 --> 01:37:54,440
With his bright eyes, his long hair, his boat
with an engine, he was much more exciting

1507
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,690
than Rafael.

1508
01:37:56,690 --> 01:38:02,239
When he talked with Rodrigo about his life
and his travels, Anita heard his stories through

1509
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:04,750
the wall of her room.

1510
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:09,639
These stories were more exciting than magic
lamps and talking fish.

1511
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:14,480
Anita soon thought Rafael was very boring.

1512
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,590
She stopped meeting him.

1513
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,400
She stopped speaking to him.

1514
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,159
Now she was sure she was falling in love with
the soldier.

1515
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:28,960
But she still kept Rafael's ring, of course.

1516
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,260
Rafael was very sad.

1517
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:35,820
He wanted the soldier to leave the village
and go away for ever.

1518
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:39,570
He wanted Anita to come back to him.

1519
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:46,250
But then, one night, Rafael was coming back
late from a fishing trip.

1520
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:50,700
He saw Anita running along the beach in the
moonlight.

1521
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:54,090
He watched quietly from the sea.

1522
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:58,659
He saw Anita meet the soldier in the little
house in the rocks.

1523
01:38:58,659 --> 01:39:02,480
How did the soldier speak to her?

1524
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,989
How did Anita give him the time and place
to meet?

1525
01:39:05,989 --> 01:39:08,250
Rafael didn't know.

1526
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:12,449
Perhaps the soldier gave her a secret note.

1527
01:39:12,449 --> 01:39:14,000
Perhaps Anita gave him one.

1528
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,510
They could both read and write.

1529
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:21,350
Rafael left his boat and swam to the shore.

1530
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:26,090
He moved very quietly through the rocks.

1531
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:31,119
The soldier's boat was in a small piece of
open water on the other side of the rocks.

1532
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:37,730
It was only about ten minutes from the village
along the coast.

1533
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:43,540
Rafael watched and waited until he saw Anita
run back to the village.

1534
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:48,040
Then he watched the soldier swim back to his
boat.

1535
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:54,800
After a few minutes, the soldier started his
engine and went away to the west.

1536
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,320
Rafael was very angry.

1537
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,099
But he was angry with the soldier, not Anita.

1538
01:40:01,099 --> 01:40:04,369
He hated this man who was a stranger in the
village.

1539
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:07,210
A man who the people all accepted as a friend.

1540
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:15,349
But a man who was now stealing Anita, his
own true love, from them.

1541
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:20,219
Next time the soldier came to the village
Rafael watched him.

1542
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:25,150
When the soldier went away in the evening,
Rafael went quietly along the beach to the

1543
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:27,989
place in the rocks.

1544
01:40:27,989 --> 01:40:34,550
Soon the soldier's boat came back into the
place in the rocks and he lowered his anchor.

1545
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:37,780
The soldier swam for a few minutes in the
moonlight.

1546
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:44,050
Then he sat in the boat again and smoked a
cigarette.

1547
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:49,090
He sat for a long time, looking sometimes
at his watch.

1548
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:54,900
At last he swam to the beach and went to the
secret place in the rocks.

1549
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:57,300
He waited there.

1550
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:01,030
Soon Anita came, hurrying over the rocks.

1551
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:02,890
She and the soldier kissed.

1552
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,620
Long, loving kisses.

1553
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:09,070
They sat in the little house in the rocks.

1554
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:11,650
The soldier held her close.

1555
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:16,199
They talked and laughed and kissed again.

1556
01:41:16,199 --> 01:41:23,020
And all the time Rafael watched and listened
to them with black hate in his heart.

1557
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:30,409
After that, Rafael followed the soldier every
time he came to the village.

1558
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:34,370
The soldier did the same every time.

1559
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:37,099
Sometimes Anita didn't come to the place in
the rocks.

1560
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:41,940
But the soldier always waited for her there.

1561
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:45,630
Then Rafael knew how to kill the soldier.

1562
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:49,219
It was a good plan.

1563
01:41:49,219 --> 01:41:55,730
The next time the soldier came to the village,
Rafael's plan was ready.

1564
01:41:55,730 --> 01:42:02,949
The soldier arrived in the village that Sunday
and went to Rodrigo's shop with the tin of

1565
01:42:02,949 --> 01:42:03,949
paraffin.

1566
01:42:03,949 --> 01:42:07,110
Rafael waited until it was dark.

1567
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:11,670
He saw the bright light of the lamp in Rodrigo's
house.

1568
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:16,130
He watched the soldier start to eat the meal
with Rodrigo.

1569
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:19,800
He had everything that he needed in his boat.

1570
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,590
He sailed out quietly to the place in the
rocks.

1571
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:27,300
The place where the soldier always waited.

1572
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:32,909
He took his boat close to the shore and tied
it to a rock.

1573
01:42:32,909 --> 01:42:37,730
Then he went on foot to old Santiago's farm.

1574
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:42,239
The old donkey was standing sleeping in its
field.

1575
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,630
Rafael walked with it down to the beach near
his boat.

1576
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,540
It wasn't very far.

1577
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:55,340
There he took the old donkey into the water,
and then killed it.

1578
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:01,619
He put the dead animal into his boat and went
out into deeper water.

1579
01:43:01,619 --> 01:43:05,500
He went to the place where the soldier usually
left his boat.

1580
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:12,590
There he began to cut up the dead donkey,
throwing the pieces into the sea.

1581
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:17,199
He and the boat were soon covered in the donkey's
blood.

1582
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:21,889
But there was much more blood in the water
all round the boat.

1583
01:43:21,889 --> 01:43:28,099
Rafael knew that the sharks, far away in the
sea, could smell it.

1584
01:43:28,099 --> 01:43:31,970
Rafael kept the back legs of the donkey in
his boat.

1585
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:37,560
He took a long, strong piece of line and tied
the legs to it.

1586
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,650
Then he sailed quietly back to the village.

1587
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:46,670
There was no moon that night, only the light
from the stars.

1588
01:43:46,670 --> 01:43:49,750
Soon he could see the beach and the houses
of the village.

1589
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:54,179
The lamp was still burning in Rodrigo's house.

1590
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:56,619
The soldier's boat was a few metres from the
shore.

1591
01:43:56,619 --> 01:43:59,639
It was always in the same place.

1592
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:04,540
The soldier didn't want to break his engine.

1593
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:09,480
Rafael moved his boat close to the soldier's
boat and stopped.

1594
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:13,440
He went into the dark water and swam across
to it.

1595
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,230
He had the end of the line in his teeth.

1596
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:19,900
He tied it to the bottom of the soldier's
boat.

1597
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:26,920
Then he swam back to his boat and put the
legs of the donkey quietly into the water.

1598
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:34,310
Now, the soldier's boat had the smell of blood
behind it.

1599
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:38,889
Rafael took his boat to the far end of the
beach in front of his house.

1600
01:44:38,889 --> 01:44:43,460
He pulled it half on to the sand, and began
to wash the donkey's blood from the bottom

1601
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:45,099
of the boat.

1602
01:44:45,099 --> 01:44:48,050
He washed some of the blood from his clothes
in the sea.

1603
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:53,489
But there was a lot of blood and water in
the boat.

1604
01:44:53,489 --> 01:44:56,409
Suddenly his mother came with an oil lamp.

1605
01:44:56,409 --> 01:44:59,750
She saw the blood on his clothes and in the
boat.

1606
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:03,200
She was afraid he was hurt.

1607
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,290
'Don't be afraid, mother,' he said.

1608
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:07,290
'I'm not hurt.

1609
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:10,330
This isn't my blood.

1610
01:45:10,330 --> 01:45:11,929
I've killed the soldier.'

1611
01:45:11,929 --> 01:45:14,860
It was true.

1612
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:21,849
The soldier wasn't yet dead, but Rafael's
plans were made.

1613
01:45:21,849 --> 01:45:24,500
Rafael wasn't afraid to tell his mother.

1614
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:27,909
She always kept his secrets.

1615
01:45:27,909 --> 01:45:30,830
She was very calm when he told her.

1616
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:34,210
She sent him to the house to change his clothes.

1617
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:38,449
She stayed and cleaned the boat.

1618
01:45:38,449 --> 01:45:42,310
When he went to the cafe, he found the soldier
there.

1619
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:43,380
He was surprised.

1620
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:48,620
He thought the soldier was spending the evening
with Rodrigo.

1621
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:51,580
Rafael looked at the soldier, his enemy.

1622
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:56,159
He was smiling and laughing with his friends.

1623
01:45:56,159 --> 01:46:00,929
Rafael thought, 'The sharks are already waiting
for you.

1624
01:46:00,929 --> 01:46:05,900
Tonight you're going to your death.'

1625
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,950
The soldier left in the middle of the evening.

1626
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:15,050
He went out to his boat, started the engine
and went off to the west.

1627
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:18,360
Rafael stayed in the cafe, listening to the
music.

1628
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:23,179
He was afraid, but he was excited, too.

1629
01:46:23,179 --> 01:46:27,690
When he heard the music, he began to dance
to the songs.

1630
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:33,969
Eyes closed, he saw in his head the soldier's
boat.

1631
01:46:33,969 --> 01:46:37,090
It went through the dark night.

1632
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:41,880
Behind it, the red line of blood, dark in
the water.

1633
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,880
The engine stopped.

1634
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,639
The boat came quietly back to the secret place
in the rocks.

1635
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:52,940
The soldier waited in the moonlight, smoking
a cigarette.

1636
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:58,659
Perhaps, then, he jumped into the dark sea
for a swim.

1637
01:46:58,659 --> 01:47:03,290
Something was waiting there, something big
and hungry.

1638
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,360
It moved fast through the water.

1639
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,320
Perhaps there was time for one short scream.

1640
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:12,390
Then all was quiet again.

1641
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:15,790
The dark waters were calm.

1642
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:20,090
And the soldier was gone for ever.

1643
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:25,960
Rafael danced and smiled and saw these pictures
again and again.

1644
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:31,060
He stayed and danced until midnight.

1645
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:35,200
Then he went back to his house and went to
bed.

1646
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,640
But he slept only for a few hours.

1647
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:44,220
Before the first light of day, he got up quietly
and went out of the house.

1648
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:49,909
He took his boat along the coast to find the
soldier's boat.

1649
01:47:49,909 --> 01:47:53,320
The boat was there in the place in the rocks.

1650
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:58,570
It lay empty and quiet in the water.

1651
01:47:58,570 --> 01:48:01,349
Rafael looked for the soldier in the sea and
on the land.

1652
01:48:01,349 --> 01:48:04,740
But there was no sign of him.

1653
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:07,829
Nothing was left of him.

1654
01:48:07,829 --> 01:48:13,250
Rafael saw the long shadows of sharks still
swimming in the water near the boat.

1655
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:15,880
The boat's engine was above the water.

1656
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:22,429
There was a long piece of fishing line tied
many times round it.

1657
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:23,810
Rafael laughed.

1658
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:28,770
'My plan was better than I thought,' he said
to himself.

1659
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:35,119
'I tied the legs of the old donkey to his
boat with some fishing line.

1660
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,780
And the line also stopped the engine.

1661
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:44,659
So the soldier had to go into the water to
untie it.'

1662
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:48,570
Rafael took the soldier's boat far from the
shore.

1663
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:53,920
There he made a hole in the bottom and pushed
it under the water.

1664
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:59,210
Soon it went down to the bottom of the sea.

1665
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:01,300
Rafael was happy.

1666
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:06,170
The soldier and his boat were at the bottom
of the sea.

1667
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:09,530
Nobody knew what happened to him.

1668
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:15,540
He went back to the village and into the house
to have an early breakfast.

1669
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:23,030
Suddenly he was very hungry.

1670
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:30,290
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Truth, at Last

1671
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:37,540
A little later (Rafael told me), he and his
mother heard the shouting and screaming from

1672
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,760
Rodrigo's house.

1673
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:45,130
They soon learned that Anita was nowhere in
the house or the village.

1674
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:47,860
Rafael smiled to himself.

1675
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:51,160
Perhaps Anita was still waiting somewhere
for her soldier.

1676
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:53,890
'She can wait forever.

1677
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:58,199
She'll never see him again,' he thought.

1678
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:03,219
'I'll sail along the coast and look for her,'
he told his mother.

1679
01:50:03,219 --> 01:50:07,480
In fact, he wanted to go to a quiet place
to wash his boat again.

1680
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:12,270
There was still some dark blood in the bottom.

1681
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:15,050
He went back to the place in the rocks. 

1682
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:18,739
It was calm and quiet there.

1683
01:50:18,739 --> 01:50:23,040
The soldier's boat was at the bottom of the
sea.

1684
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,429
Rafael took some water from the sea to wash
his boat.

1685
01:50:26,429 --> 01:50:31,460
A small shark swam slowly under it.

1686
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:36,390
Almost without thinking, Rafael picked up
his fishing spear.

1687
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:40,150
He hit the shark hard through the back of
the head.

1688
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:43,650
Its blood came out into the clear water.

1689
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:49,610
A few other sharks, bigger ones, smelt the
blood and came fast through the water.

1690
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:53,770
They began to bite at the dying fish with
their great, sharp teeth.

1691
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:58,949
They fought, biting great pieces off the dead
shark.

1692
01:50:58,949 --> 01:51:03,730
Rafael decided to catch one or two and cut
them up in his boat.

1693
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:08,099
He wanted their blood to be in the boat with
the donkey's.

1694
01:51:08,099 --> 01:51:12,880
A white shark about three metres long was
pulling at the dead one.

1695
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:17,400
If lay in the water next to the boat, not
moving.

1696
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:21,860
Rafael killed it with his spear and put a
line round its head.

1697
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:26,860
Then he pulled it into the bottom of the boat.

1698
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:32,219
Rafael took his knife and cut the shark open
from neck to tail.

1699
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:37,429
Pieces of meat, fish and hair from its Stomach
fell out into the bottom of the boat.

1700
01:51:37,429 --> 01:51:41,969
There was a large piece of donkey skin with
its grey hair.

1701
01:51:41,969 --> 01:51:45,660
Rafael moved it with his knife.

1702
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:50,150
In that second, the world stopped.

1703
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:52,690
Rafael's blood seemed to freeze inside him.

1704
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:54,300
The sky went dark.

1705
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,639
He couldn't move.

1706
01:51:57,639 --> 01:52:03,619
In the pile of meat and fish in the bottom
of the boat there was a hand.

1707
01:52:03,619 --> 01:52:09,290
A complete hand, white and clean.

1708
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:14,219
It was cut off at the wrist with one clean
bite.

1709
01:52:14,219 --> 01:52:18,390
It was a small hand, with small, pretty fingers.

1710
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:22,280
The fingernails were long and pink.

1711
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:27,520
They weren't bitten or dirty or broken by
housework.

1712
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:34,650
And on the middle finger of the hand was a
gold ring, a ring in the shape of a golden

1713
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:38,239
fish

1714
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:42,760
Rafael gave one great scream.

1715
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:46,389
He held his head in his hands.

1716
01:52:46,389 --> 01:52:50,070
He knew now where Anita was.

1717
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:57,239
The night before, when the engine of the soldier's
boat stopped working, she was there in the

1718
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,829
boat with him.

1719
01:52:59,829 --> 01:53:03,369
Then he went into the water to look at the
engine.

1720
01:53:03,369 --> 01:53:05,860
She stayed in the boat.

1721
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:10,119
She saw him, when the sharks killed him in
the dark water.

1722
01:53:10,119 --> 01:53:13,659
Perhaps she tried to pull him into the boat.

1723
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:17,679
But then she too fell into the blood-red water.

1724
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:26,309
And there she spent the last terrible seconds
of her life with her true prince, the soldier.

1725
01:53:26,309 --> 01:53:29,040
Rafael knew he couldn't continue living.

1726
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:32,980
He couldn't live with this terrible secret.

1727
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:37,219
He stood up in the boat and called Anita's
name.

1728
01:53:37,219 --> 01:53:40,820
Then he threw himself into the sea.

1729
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:43,599
He lay in the water, face down.

1730
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:50,250
He waited for the sharp teeth in the mouths
of the sharks to pull him down to his death.

1731
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:53,469
But they didn't.

1732
01:53:53,469 --> 01:53:57,610
He felt them in the water all round him.

1733
01:53:57,610 --> 01:54:00,780
Sometimes he felt them push against him.

1734
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:03,970
But they didn't hurt him.

1735
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:07,469
Then Rafael understood.

1736
01:54:07,469 --> 01:54:10,540
God didn't want him to die this way.

1737
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:11,790
An easy death.

1738
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:13,520
A quick death.

1739
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:18,110
Too quick and easy for a murderer.

1740
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:20,420
He was terribly afraid.

1741
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:22,650
He tried to kill himself.

1742
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:25,940
He held his face under the water and tried
to die.

1743
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:29,989
But he couldn't.

1744
01:54:29,989 --> 01:54:33,949
At last he climbed back into the boat.

1745
01:54:33,949 --> 01:54:41,730
He sat like a dead man and looked at the little
hand with the gold ring.

1746
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:46,579
After a long time he took the ring carefully
from her finger.

1747
01:54:46,579 --> 01:54:52,329
He took a piece of fishing line and tied the
ring round his neck.

1748
01:54:52,329 --> 01:54:55,199
He had his ring again.

1749
01:54:55,199 --> 01:55:00,079
He had it from Anita's own hand.

1750
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:03,400
'I'll keep it with me forever,' he thought.

1751
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:10,040
'Then I will never forget my terrible crime.'

1752
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:13,170
He threw the dead shark back into the sea.

1753
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:21,450
Then, last of all, he took the cold white
hand.

1754
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:25,489
He held it in his own hand for the last time.

1755
01:55:25,489 --> 01:55:30,770
Then he put it carefully into the water.

1756
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:36,429
Then he lay down in the bottom of the boat
holding the ring at his neck.

1757
01:55:36,429 --> 01:55:41,829
And he looked at the bright sky and talked
to Anita.

1758
01:55:41,829 --> 01:55:48,080
And they laughed and laughed...

1759
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,080
***

1760
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:52,360
I took Rafael's body back to his village.

1761
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:55,780
He lies in the ground near that place in the
rocks.

1762
01:55:55,780 --> 01:56:01,270
The secret place where he and Anita spent
many happy hours.

1763
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:04,770
I put the gold ring round his neck.

1764
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:08,780
The ring that he took from Anita's dead hand.

1765
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:13,119
It will stay with him forever.

1766
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:17,450
Nobody in the village knows what he did.

1767
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:20,849
Not Rodrigo, not my uncle or Rosa.

1768
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:28,920
They still believe that Anita and the soldier
are living somewhere far away.

1769
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:31,460
I can see no reason to tell them anything
different.

1770
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,119
- THE END -
