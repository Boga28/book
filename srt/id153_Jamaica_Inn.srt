CHAPTER ONE
Jamaica Inn

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,089
It was a cold grey day in late November, and
although it was now only a little after two

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:17,080
o'clock in the afternoon the dark of a winter
evening seemed to have come down over the

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
hills, hiding them in mist.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,090
The air was cold, and in spite of the tightly
closed windows, it found its way into the

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,090
coach.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,800
There must have been a small crack in the
roof, because now and again little drops of

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,410
rain fell softly through onto the leather
seats.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:43,550
The wind blew hard, and on high ground, it
blew with such force that the whole body of

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,390
the coach trembled and struggled to stay upright.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,600
The wheels of the coach sank into the holes
in the road, and sometimes they threw up mud

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,879
against the windows, where it mixed with the
rain so that any view there might have been

13
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,539
was blocked out.

14
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,020
The few passengers sat close together for
warmth.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,409
Mary Yellan was sitting where the drops of
rain came through the crack in the roof.

16
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:15,670
She brushed them away with impatient fingers.

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,540
Although she was only 40 miles by road from
what had been her home for 23 years, she was

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,710
already beginning to miss it.

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:31,399
The courage, which was so large a part of
her, and had helped her so much during the

20
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:39,530
long unhappiness of her mother's illness and
death, was now shaken by this rain and wind.

21
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,260
She remembered the letter from her aunt.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,310
The writer said that the news had shocked
her; that she had had no idea that her sister

23
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,080
was ill, because it was many years since she
had been in Helford.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,450
And she went on: 'There have been changes
with us that you will not know about.

25
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:09,429
I no longer live in Bodmin, but nearly 12
miles outside it, on the road to Launceston.

26
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:16,000
It's a wild and lonely spot, and if you were
to come to us I should be glad of your company

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,150
in wintertime.

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,129
I have asked your uncle, and he does not object,
he says, if you do not talk too much and will

29
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,379
give help when it is needed.

30
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:33,440
He cannot give you money or feed you for nothing,
as you will understand.

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,209
He will expect your help in the bar in return
for your room and meals.

32
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:44,700
You see, your uncle is the landlord of Jamaica
Inn.'

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,920
The letter was a strange message of welcome
from the smiling Aunt Patience she remembered.

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,080
A cold, empty letter, giving no word of comfort,
and little information, except that she must

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,689
not ask for money.

36
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:11,129
Aunt Patience, with her silk skirts and delicate
ways, the wife of an innkeeper!

37
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:16,220
So it was that Mary Yellan found herself travelling
north in the coach.

38
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,610
Villages were scattered now, and there were
few smiling faces at the doors of the small

39
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,350
houses.

40
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,849
There were almost no trees.

41
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,629
The wind blew and the rain came with the wind.

42
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:37,760
And so the coach rolled into Bodmin, grey
and unwelcoming like the hills around it,

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,189
and one by one the passengers collected up
their things ready to leave - all except Mary,

44
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,540
who sat still in her corner.

45
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,110
The driver, his face a stream of rain, looked
in at the window.

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,030
'Are you going on to Launceston?'

47
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,560
he said.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,480
'It'll be a wild drive tonight across the
moors.

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,819
You can stay in Bodmin, you know, and go on
by coach in the morning.

50
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,219
There'll be no one but you going on in this
coach.'

51
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,280
'My friends will be expecting me,' said Mary.

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,579
'I'm not afraid of the drive.

53
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,510
And I don't want to go as far as Launceston;
will you please leave me at Jamaica Inn?'

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,080
The man looked at her strangely.

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,340
Jamaica Inn?' he said.

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,330
'What would you do at Jamaica Inn?

57
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,760
That's no place for a girl.

58
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,660
You must have made a mistake, surely?'

59
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,750
He looked at her hard, not believing her.

60
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,500
Then he called over his shoulder to a woman
who stood in the doorway of the Royal Hotel,

61
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,650
lighting a lamp.

62
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,320
It was already getting dark.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,300
'Come here and reason with this young girl.

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:07,990
I was told she was going to Launceston, but
she has asked me to leave her at Jamaica Inn!'

65
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,860
The woman came down the steps and looked into
the coach.

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,280
'It's a wild, rough place up there,' she said,
'and if you're looking for work, you won't

67
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,971
find it on the farms.

68
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,050
They don't like strangers on the moors.

69
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,320
You'd do better down here in Bodmin.'

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,740
Mary smiled at her.

71
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,819
'I shall be all right,' she said.

72
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,789
'I'm going to relatives.

73
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:38,669
My uncle is the landlord of Jamaica Inn.'

74
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,550
There was a long silence.

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,090
In the grey light of the coach, Mary could
see that the woman and the man were looking

76
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,810
at her.

77
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,830
She felt cold, suddenly, and anxious.

78
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,330
Then the woman stepped back from the window.

79
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,960
'I'm sorry,' she said.

80
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,599
'It's none of my business, of course.

81
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,639
Good night.'

82
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,069
The driver began to whistle, rather red in
the face, as one who wishes to end an awkward

83
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,639
situation.

84
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,050
Mary leant forward and touched his arm.

85
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,819
'Would you tell me?'

86
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:17,819
she said.

87
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,490
'I shan't mind what you say.

88
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,800
Is my uncle not liked?

89
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,419
Is something the matter?'

90
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,400
The man looked very uncomfortable.

91
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,870
He avoided her eyes.

92
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:40,680
'Jamaica Inn's got a bad name,' he said; 'strange
stories are told - you know how it is.

93
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,960
But I don't want to make any trouble.

94
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,699
Perhaps they're not true.'

95
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,690
'What sort of stories?' asked Mary.

96
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,259
'Do you mean that people get drunk there?

97
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,460
Does my uncle encourage bad company?'

98
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,300
The man did not answer.

99
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,669
'I don't want to make trouble,' he repeated,
'and I don't know anything.

100
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:09,030
It's only what people say.

101
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,460
Respectable people don't go to Jamaica Inn
any more.

102
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,440
That's all I know.

103
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,349
In the old days, we used to water the horses
there, and feed them, and go in for a bite

104
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,220
of food and drink.

105
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,840
But we don't stop there anymore.'

106
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,100
'Why don't people go there?

107
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,790
What is their reason?'

108
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,509
The man paused; it was as if he were searching
for words.

109
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:48,350
'They're afraid,' he said at last, and then
he shook his head; he had no more to say.

110
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,810
He shut the door and climbed into his seat.

111
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:59,280
The coach rolled away down the street, past
the safe and solid houses, the busy lights,

112
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,990
the scattered people hurrying home for supper,
their figures bent against the weather.

113
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,130
Now the horses were climbing the steep hill
out of the town and, looking through the window

114
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,729
at the back of the coach, Mary could see the
lights of Bodmin fast disappearing, one by

115
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,570
one, until the last was gone.

116
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:26,800
She was alone now with the wind and the rain,
and 12 long miles of empty moor between her

117
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,770
and her journey's end.

118
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:35,260
She sat in her corner, shaken from side to
side by the coach.

119
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,910
On either side of the road, the countryside
stretched away into space.

120
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:49,890
No trees, no paths, no houses, but mile after
mile of moor, dark and empty, rolling like

121
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,270
a desert to the unseen horizon.

122
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:59,370
No human being could live in this country,
thought Mary, and remain like other people;

123
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,740
the children would be born twisted, like the
blackened bushes, bent by the force of a wind

124
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,890
that never stopped blowing.

125
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:16,190
Their minds would be twisted too, their thoughts
evil, living, as they must among rough bushes

126
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,130
and hard stone.

127
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,650
She lifted the window and looked out.

128
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,940
Ahead of her, at the top of hill on the left,
was some sort of building, standing back from

129
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,550
the road.

130
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,250
She could see tall chimneys in the darkness.

131
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,880
There was no other house near.

132
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,930
If this was Jamaica Inn, it stood alone, unprotected
from the winds.

133
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:49,200
The horses came to a stop, clouds of steam
rising from their hot, wet bodies.

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,950
The driver climbed down from his seat, pulling
her box down with him.

135
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,180
He seemed to be in a hurry, and kept looking
over his shoulder towards the house.

136
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,130
'Here you are,' he said, 'across the yard
over there.

137
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,290
If you hammer on the door, they'll let you
in.

138
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,980
I must be going on, or I'll not reach Launceston
tonight.'

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:22,300
In a moment, the coach was away down the road,
disappearing as if it had never existed, lost

140
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,510
and swallowed up in the darkness.

141
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,640
Mary stood alone, with her box at her feet.

142
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,960
She heard the sound of the door being unlocked
in the dark house behind her, and then it

143
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,600
was thrown open.

144
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,310
A great figure walked into the yard, swinging
a light from side to side.

145
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,470
'Who is it?'

146
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,620
came a shout.

147
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,350
'What do you want here?'

148
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,750
Mary stepped forward and looked up into the
man's face.

149
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,670
The light shone in her eyes, and she could
see nothing.

150
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,660
'Oh, it's you, is it?' he said.

151
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,880
'So you've come to us after all?

152
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,730
I'm your uncle, Joss Merlyn.

153
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,100
Welcome to Jamaica Inn.'

154
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,360
He pulled her into the shelter of the house,
laughing, then shut the door and put the light

155
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,230
on a table in the passage.

156
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,240
And they looked at each other face to face.

157
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,200
CHAPTER TWO
The Landlord

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:48,940
He was a great big man, nearly 7 feet high,
with a lined face and dark brown skin.

159
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,410
His thick black hair hung down over his eyes
and round his ears.

160
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,770
He looked as if he had the strength of a horse,
with large, powerful shoulders, long arms

161
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,610
that reached almost to his knees, and big
hands.

162
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:10,570
His nose was hooked, curving to a mouth that
might have been perfect once but was now sunken

163
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,800
and fallen, but there was still something
fine about his great dark eyes, in spite of

164
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,350
the lines around them.

165
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:25,270
The best things left to him were his teeth,
which were all good still, and very white,

166
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:32,100
so that when he smiled they showed up clearly
against the brown of his face; but it was

167
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,250
a cold, evil smile.

168
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:43,620
'So you are Mary Yellan,' he said at last,
towering above her, his head bent to examine

169
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:51,910
her more closely, 'and you've come all this
way to look after your Uncle Joss.

170
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,180
I call it very nice of you.'

171
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:04,190
He laughed again, his laugh filling the house,
and striking Mary, in her cold, tired anxiety,

172
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,890
like a whip.

173
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,230
'Where is my Aunt Patience?'

174
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,790
she asked, looking around her in the dark
passage, with its cold stone floor and narrow

175
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,980
staircase.

176
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,790
'Is she not expecting me, then?'

177
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:28,560
'Where's my Aunt Patience?' he repeated, copying
the rise and fall of her voice.

178
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,050
Then he lifted his face to the stairs.

179
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,860
'Patience!' he shouted, 'What are you doing?

180
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,000
Here's the girl arrived, crying for you.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
She's tired of the sight of me already.'

182
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,700
There was a noise at the top of the stairs.

183
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:55,240
Then down came a woman, her hand raised to
keep the light from her eyes.

184
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,690
She wore a cap on her thin grey hair, which
hung to her shoulders.

185
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,410
Her eyes were large, as though they were continually
asking questions, and she had a little habit

186
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:12,270
of moving her mouth - tightening her lips
and then relaxing them.

187
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:19,440
She wore an old striped skirt that had once
been red and was now a pale pink.

188
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,800
Mary watched her without speaking, full of
sorrow.

189
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,940
Was this poor creature the beautiful Aunt
Patience of her dreams - dressed like this,

190
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,080
and looking twenty years older than she was?

191
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,320
The little woman came down the stairs and
into the hall; she took Mary's hands in hers

192
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,330
and looked closely into her face.

193
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,310
'Have you really come?'

194
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,750
she whispered.

195
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,730
'It is Mary Yellan, isn't it?

196
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,950
My dead sister's child?'

197
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,570
Mary thanked God that her mother could not
see her now.

198
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:07,430
'Dear Aunt Patience,' she said gently, 'I'm
glad to see you again.

199
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,240
It's so many long years since you came to
us at Helford.'

200
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,250
The woman suddenly held her tightly, burying
her head against her shoulder, and she began

201
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,560
to cry, loudly and fearfully.

202
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,360
'Ah, stop that,' shouted the husband.

203
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,990
'What sort of welcome is this?

204
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,420
What have you got to cry about, you fool?

205
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,490
Can't you see the girl wants her supper?

206
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,530
Get out to the kitchen and give her some meat
and a drink.'

207
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,600
Aunt Patience controlled herself.

208
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,840
She led the way to another dark passage, and
so into the kitchen where a low fire burned.

209
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:00,120
'You mustn't mind your Uncle Joss,' she said,
her manner changing suddenly to that of a

210
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,750
dog that has been trained by continuous cruelty
to unquestioning obedience and who, in spite

211
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,690
of kicks and shouts, will fight like a tiger
for his master.

212
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:19,910
'Your uncle must be treated carefully, you
know; he has his ways, and strangers don't

213
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,350
understand him at first.

214
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:28,220
He's a very good husband to me, and has been
ever since our wedding day.'

215
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,800
She talked on and on, going backwards and
forwards across the stone-floored kitchen

216
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,420
as she laid the table for supper.

217
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:44,240
There was a footstep outside the door, and
with a sinking heart, Mary realized that Joss

218
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,420
Merlyn had come downstairs again.

219
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,610
He entered the room, and looked from one to
the other.

220
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,540
He pulled a chair from the wall, and crashed
it against the table.

221
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,220
Then he sat down heavily and, reaching for
the loaf, cut himself a great piece of bread,

222
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,680
which he pushed into his mouth, before calling
Mary to the table.

223
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:13,500
'You need food, I can see that,' he said,
and carefully buttered the loaf.

224
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:21,310
He cut a thin piece from it and then cut this
into four quarters for her, the whole business

225
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:27,500
very delicately done and quite different from
his manner in serving himself - so much, so

226
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,500
that to Mary there was something almost frightening
in the change from roughness to gentle care.

227
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,540
It was as if there was some power in his fingers,
which turned them suddenly, and unexpectedly

228
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,260
into skilful servants.

229
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:50,330
'Patience,' he said, 'here's the key Go and
get me a bottle, in the Lords name - I've

230
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,220
a terrible thirst!'

231
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:59,600
In a few minutes his wife returned with the
alcohol, which she put in front of her husband,

232
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,920
and while she finished her cooking and served
Mary and herself, he began drinking, kicking

233
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,050
the leg of the table.

234
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,600
Suddenly he struck the table with his hand,
shaking the plates and cups; one fell to the

235
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,330
ground and broke.

236
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:25,710
'I'll tell you something, Mary Yellan,' he
shouted, 'I'm master in this house, and I

237
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,180
want you to know it.

238
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:34,700
You'll do as you're told, and help in the
house and serve in the bar, and I'll not lay

239
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,720
a finger on you.

240
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,400
But, by God, if you open your mouth, I'll
punish you until you eat out of my hand the

241
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,060
same as your aunt there.'

242
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,760
Mary faced him across the table.

243
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,610
She held her hands below the table so that
he could not see them tremble.

244
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,930
'I understand you,' she said.

245
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,530
'It doesn't matter to me what you do in the
inn.

246
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll do my work in the house, and you'll have
no cause to complain.

247
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:14,480
But if you hurt my Aunt Patience in any way,
I tell you this - I'll leave Jamaica Inn immediately,

248
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,290
and I'll find a magistrate and bring him here,
and use the law against you; and then try

249
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,820
to punish me if you like!'

250
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,630
Mary had turned very pale.

251
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,180
She did not know it, but she had saved herself;
her little show of courage had an effect on

252
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,080
the man, who leant back in his chair and relaxed.

253
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,260
'That's very pretty,' he said; 'very prettily
put.

254
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,910
Now we know just what sort of visitor we have.

255
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,830
Make her angry, and she shows her teeth.

256
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:59,570
All right, my dear; you and I are more like
each other than I thought.

257
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:06,280
If we're going to play, we'll play together.

258
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:14,640
I may have work for you at Jamaica Inn one
day, work that you've never done before.

259
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,200
Man's work, Mary Yellan, where you play with
life and death.'

260
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,430
Mary heard a faint cry from Aunt Patience
beside her.

261
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,870
'Oh, Joss,' she whispered.

262
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,170
'Oh, Joss, please!'

263
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,460
There was so much fear in her voice that Mary
looked at her in surprise.

264
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Her uncle waved his hand impatiently.

265
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,530
'Get up to bed, Patience,' he said.

266
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,180
'I'm tired of your miserable face at my supper
table.

267
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,690
This girl and I understand each other.

268
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,260
The woman rose immediately and went to the
door.

269
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,190
After a last helpless look over her shoulder,
she went upstairs.

270
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,100
Joss Merlyn and Mary were alone.

271
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,290
He pushed the empty glass away from him and
folded his arms on the table.

272
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:21,620
'There's been one weakness in my life, and
I'll tell you what it is.

273
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
It's drink.

274
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,250
It's a curse, and I know it.

275
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,730
I can't stop myself.

276
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,250
One day it will be the end of me, and a good
thing too.

277
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,320
Days go by and I don't touch more than a drop.

278
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:46,530
And then I'll feel the thirst come on me and
I'll drink - drink for hours.

279
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:53,230
I talk then - talk until everything I've done
is told to the four winds.

280
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,910
I've told you because I've already had too
much and I can't hold my tongue.

281
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,520
But I've not lost control of my head.

282
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:10,080
I've not had enough to tell you why I live
in this forgotten place, and why I'm the landlord

283
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,390
of Jamaica Inn.'

284
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,070
His voice was hardly more than a whisper.

285
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,180
The fire had sunk low, and dark shadows stretched
long fingers on the wall.

286
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,630
The light on the table threw a great, ugly
shadow of Joss Merlyn on the ceiling.

287
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,370
The coaches don't stop here now.

288
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,280
I don't worry; I've visitors enough.

289
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:42,750
The farther the gentlemen keep away, the better
pleased I am.

290
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,530
Ah, there's drinking here all right, and plenty
of it too.

291
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:55,870
There are some who come to Jamaica Inn on
Saturday night, and there are some who turn

292
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:02,390
the key of their door and sleep with their
fingers in their ears.

293
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,260
There are nights when every house on the moors
is dark and silent, and the only lights for

294
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,710
miles are the windows of Jamaica Inn.

295
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:19,750
They say the shouting and the singing can
be heard as far down as the farms below Roughtor.

296
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:28,340
You'll be in the bar those nights, if you
like, and you'll see what company I keep.'

297
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,720
Mary sat very still, holding tightly to the
sides of her chair.

298
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,720
'They're all afraid of me,' he went on; 'the
whole cursed lot of them.

299
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,060
Afraid of me, who's afraid of no man.

300
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,320
It's the drink that's been against me.

301
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,890
Drink and my hot blood.

302
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,380
It's the curse of all of us, Mary.

303
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,870
There's never been a Merlyn yet that died
peaceful in his bed.

304
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:09,070
'My father was hanged at Exeter - he had a
quarrel with a man, and killed him.

305
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:18,110
I'm the oldest of three brothers, all born
under the shadow of Kilman You walk out over

306
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:24,970
there across the moor, and you'll see a great
rock like a devil's hand sticking up into

307
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,130
the sky.

308
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:35,520
That's Kilman If you'd been born under its
shadow you'd start to drink, as I did.

309
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,480
My brother Matthew was drowned in Trewartha
Marsh.

310
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:47,780
We thought he'd gone to be a sailor, and had
no news of him, and then in the summer no

311
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:54,710
rain fell for seven months, and there was
Matthew sticking up in the marsh, with his

312
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,950
hands above his head, and the birds flying
round him.

313
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,390
My brother Jem was the baby.

314
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,480
Hanging on to mother's skirts when Matthew
and I were grown men.

315
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,320
I never did agree with Jem.

316
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,220
Too clever he is - too quick with his tongue.

317
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,970
Oh, they will catch him in time and hang him,
as they did my father.'

318
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,640
He was silent, looking into his empty glass.

319
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,610
'I've said enough.

320
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll have no more tonight.

321
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,830
Go up to bed, Mary.

322
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,430
You 11 find your room above the front door.'

323
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:47,000
Mary was about to pass him when he seized
hold of her shoulder and twisted her round.

324
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,700
'There'll be nights sometimes when you hear
wheels on the road,' he said, 'and those wheels

325
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,050
will not pass on, but they'll stop outside
Jamaica Inn.

326
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,140
And you'll hear footsteps in the yard, and
voices beneath your window.

327
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:13,480
When that happens, you'll stay in bed, Mary
Yellan, and cover your head with the bedclothes.

328
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,120
Do you understand?'

329
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,890
'Yes, uncle.'

330
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,650
'Very well.

331
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:29,730
Now go, and if you ever ask me a question
'I'll break every bone in your body.'

332
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:36,370
She went out of the room, into the dark passage
and up the stairs, feeling the wall with her

333
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,890
hands.

334
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,430
Her uncle had told her that her room was over
the front door.

335
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,290
Her box lay on the floor.

336
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,320
The walls were rough and unpapered and the
floorboards dirty.

337
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,851
A box turned on its side served as a table,
with a cracked mirror on top.

338
00:26:54,851 --> 00:27:01,380
The thin bedclothes were not dry enough to
sleep under.

339
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,480
She went to the window and looked out.

340
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,330
The wind had gone down, but it was still raining
- a thin, miserable rain that ran down the

341
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,440
side of the house and mixed with the dirt
on the window.

342
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,100
Whatever she would have to face in the future,
and no matter how frightened she might be,

343
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,429
she would not leave Jamaica Inn now.

344
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:27,540
She must stay with Aunt Patience.

345
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,760
She was needed here.

346
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:36,300
And so Mary lay, fully dressed, on her hard
bed, her mind working while she prayed for

347
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,300
sleep.

348
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,530
She counted the minutes and the hours of an
endless night, and when the first bird sang

349
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:52,980
in the field behind the house she counted
no more, but slept like a dead thing.

350
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,470
CHAPTER THREE
The Locked Door

351
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,810
Mary woke to a high wind from the west, and
a thin watery sun.

352
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:09,000
After breakfast, during the usual morning
housework, Mary was able to explore the Inn

353
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,240
more thoroughly.

354
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,800
It was a dark place, with long passages and
unexpected rooms.

355
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,550
There was a separate entrance to the bar at
the side of the house, and though the room

356
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,910
was empty now, there was something heavy in
the air from the last time it was full - a

357
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:34,740
taste of old tobacco, the sour smell of drink
and the suggestion of warm, unclean people

358
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,430
crowded one against the other on the dark
wooden seats.

359
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,880
Down a passage in the opposite direction from
the kitchen was another room, the door of

360
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,820
which was locked.

361
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,809
Mary went out into the yard to look at it
through the window, but there was a board

362
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:58,860
nailed up against the window frame, and she
could not see inside.

363
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,820
The house and other buildings formed three
sides of the square that was the little yard.

364
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,870
Beyond this lay the road, a thin white track
that stretched to the horizon, surrounded

365
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:17,140
on each side by the moors, brown and wet from
the heavy rains.

366
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,870
Mary went out on the road and looked round
her, and as far as the eye could see, there

367
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,480
was nothing but the black hills and the moors.

368
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:35,240
The grey stone inn, with its tall chimneys,
was the only house in view.

369
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,780
She went back into the house to find Aunt
Patience.

370
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:46,190
'Aunt Patience,' she began, 'why is my uncle
the landlord of Jamaica Inn?'

371
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,940
The sudden direct attack took the woman by
surprise, and for a moment, she looked back

372
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,920
at Mary without reply.

373
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,890
Then she went red.

374
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:06,559
'Well,' she said, 'it's - it's a very important
place here, on the road.

375
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,040
You can see that.

376
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,940
This is the main road from the south.

377
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,170
The coaches pass here twice a week.

378
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,500
There are always travellers on the road.

379
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,800
We do good trade here.'

380
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:28,110
'How can you say that, when the rooms are
never used, and the bedrooms are fit only

381
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,730
for rats and mice?

382
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,390
I've seen them for myself.'

383
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:39,500
Her aunt was silent for a moment, working
her mouth and twisting her fingers together.

384
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,880
'Your Uncle Joss doesn't encourage people
to stay.

385
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,670
We do a good trade, I've told you that.

386
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,410
Men come in from the farms.

387
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:02,910
There are farms and houses scattered all over
the moors for miles around, and men come from

388
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,060
there for a drink.

389
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,360
There are evenings when the bar is full.'

390
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,660
'The driver of the coach yesterday said that
respectable people did not come to Jamaica

391
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,750
Inn any more.

392
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,940
He said they were afraid.'

393
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,090
Aunt Patience changed colour.

394
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:27,640
She was pale now, and her eyes moved from
side to side.

395
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,470
She swallowed, and ran her tongue over her
lips.

396
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:40,900
'Your Uncle Joss has a quick temper,' she
said; 'you have seen that for yourself.

397
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,530
He is easily angered.'

398
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:48,130
Her eyes begged to be excused further questioning.

399
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:54,520
Mary saw that she had suffered enough, but
tried one more question.

400
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:02,140
'Aunt Patience,' she said, 'I want you to
look at me and answer me this, and then I

401
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,980
won't worry you again.

402
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,270
What has the locked room at the end of the
passage to do with the wheels that stop outside

403
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,420
Jamaica Inn by night?'

404
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,080
As soon as she had spoken, she was sorry.

405
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,610
A strange expression came over the woman's
face, and her great hollow eyes looked across

406
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,210
the table in fear.

407
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,490
Her mouth trembled, and one hand wandered
to her throat.

408
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,559
Mary pushed back her chair and knelt by her
side.

409
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,880
She put her arms around Aunt Patience, and
held her close, and kissed her hair.

410
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,649
'I'm sorry,' she said.

411
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:48,200
'Don't be angry with me.

412
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,910
It's not my business, and I've no right to
question you, and I'm ashamed of myself.

413
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,720
Please, please forget what I said.'

414
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,780
Her aunt buried her face in her hands.

415
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:08,850
Then she looked over her shoulder, as if she
were afraid that Joss himself stood in the

416
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,130
shadows behind the door.

417
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:18,490
'Things happen at Jamaica Inn, Mary that I've
never dared to breathe a word about.

418
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,190
Bad things.

419
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,890
Evil things.

420
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,320
I can't ever tell you.

421
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,040
I can't even admit them to myself.

422
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,890
Some of it you'll come to know in time.

423
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,200
You can't avoid it, living here.

424
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:46,630
Your Uncle Joss mixes with strange men, who
follow a strange trade.

425
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:54,429
Sometimes they come by night, and from your
window you will hear footsteps, and voices,

426
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:57,460
and knocking at the door.

427
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:04,000
Your uncle lets them in, and he takes them
along the passage to that room with the locked

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
door.

429
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,110
Before day, they are gone, and no sign is
left that they have ever been.

430
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,580
When they come, Mary, you will say nothing
to me or to your Uncle Joss.

431
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,030
You must lie in bed and put your hands over
your ears.'

432
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:31,600
Then she rose from the table, and pushed her
chair back, and Mary heard her climb the stairs

433
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,490
with heavy feet.

434
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:40,359
Joss Merlyn was away from the house for nearly
a week, and during that time, Mary learnt

435
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,590
something about the area.

436
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:48,730
After helping her aunt in the house and kitchen,
she was free to wander where she pleased.

437
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:54,470
The moors were even wilder than she had at
first supposed.

438
00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:01,720
Like a wide desert, they rolled from east
to west, with paths here and there across

439
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,800
the surface, and great hills breaking the
skyline.

440
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,880
It was a silent, empty country, untouched
by human hand; on the high tors the stones

441
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,990
leant against one another in strange shapes,
great watchmen who had stood there since the

442
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,870
hand of God first formed them.

443
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,190
Wild sheep lived on the high tors.

444
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:34,920
Black cattle fed on the moors beneath, their
careful feet choosing the firm ground, as

445
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,700
with inborn knowledge they avoided the long,
green grass that was not grass at all, but

446
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,980
soft, dangerous marsh.

447
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:51,359
There was a silence on the tors that belonged
to another age; an age that is past and gone

448
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,950
as though it had never been, an age when man
did not exist.

449
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:03,590
One day Mary crossed the East Moor, in the
direction that Joss had described to her on

450
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,870
the first evening; and when she had gone some
way and stood alone on a hill, surrounded

451
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:16,800
on all sides by empty moors, she saw that
the land sloped down to a deep and dangerous

452
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,960
marsh, through which ran a stream.

453
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:27,250
And rising beyond the marsh, away on the other
side, pointing its fingers to the sky, was

454
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:34,960
a great rock like a broken hand coming straight
out of the moor, its surface neatly formed

455
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,540
as if cut by an artist.

456
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:47,109
So this was Kilmar Tor; and somewhere over
there, where the hills hid the sun, Joss Merlyn

457
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,170
had been born and his brother lived today.

458
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:56,369
Below her in the marsh, Matthew Merlyn had
been drowned.

459
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:04,590
Mary turned her back on Kilmar and began to
run across the moor; nor did she stop until

460
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:11,180
the marsh disappeared below the level of the
hill, and the tor itself was hidden.

461
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,140
She had come farther than she had intended,
and the way home was long.

462
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,340
It seemed an age before the last hill was
behind her, and the tall chimneys of Jamaica

463
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,920
Inn stood out in front of her.

464
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,790
As she crossed the yard, she noticed with
a sinking heart that the stable door was open,

465
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,760
and the horse was inside.

466
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,440
Joss Merlyn had returned.

467
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,680
She opened the door as silently as possible,
but it rubbed against the stone floor and

468
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,510
made a noise in protest.

469
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:51,930
In a moment, the landlord appeared and called
to her as she started up the stairs to her

470
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,930
room.

471
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:57,530
'Here,' he said, 'no hiding up there this
evening.

472
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,540
There will be work for you in the bar, with
your uncle.

473
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,360
Don't you know what day of the week it is?'

474
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,690
Mary paused to think.

475
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,060
She was losing count of time.

476
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,640
Was it Monday's coach she had taken?

477
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,640
That made today Saturday - Saturday night.

478
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,870
Immediately she realized what Joss Merlyn
meant.

479
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:31,270
Tonight there would be company at Jamaica
Inn.

480
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:35,740
CHAPTER FOUR
Wagons in the Night

481
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:42,400
They came one by one, the people of the moors,
crossing the yard quickly and silently, as

482
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
If they had no wish to be seen.

483
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,040
They were a strange collection grouped around
Joss Merlyn in the bar.

484
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,460
Half hidden by rows of bottles and glasses,
Mary could look down on the company and remain

485
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
unseen.

486
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:05,151
They lay on the seats; they leant against
the walls; they sat beside the tables; and

487
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:11,180
one or two, whose heads or stomachs were weaker
than the rest, already lay full length on

488
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,230
the floor.

489
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:17,610
Most of them were dirty, with long hair and
broken fingernails: cattle-stealers, sailors,

490
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,610
wandering salesmen, thieves.

491
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:27,590
The 
smell of drink and tobacco and unwashed bodies

492
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,040
was strong.

493
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,420
Mary felt disgust rise up in her, and she
knew that she would give way to it if she

494
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,040
stayed there long.

495
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,480
The evening seemed endless, and her one thought
was of escape.

496
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,180
The air was so thick with smoke and breath
that it was hard to see across the room, and

497
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:56,770
to her tired, half-closed eyes the faces of
the men seemed shapeless, all hair and teeth,

498
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,960
their mouths much too large for their bodies,
while those who had drunk too much lay on

499
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,970
the seats or on the floor like dead men, their
faces in their hands.

500
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:15,230
Those who could still stand had crowded round
a dirty little pedlar from Redruth, who had

501
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,470
made himself the joker of the group.

502
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:24,180
The mine where he had worked was now in ruins,
and he had taken to the road as a pedlar,

503
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,360
and had stored up a collection of songs with
which he now entertained the company.

504
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,619
The laughter that greeted his rude songs and
jokes nearly shook the roof.

505
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:41,910
To Mary there was something horrible in this
ugly, shouting laughter, which in some strange

506
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:49,230
way held no note of amusement, but rang down
the dark stone passages and into the empty

507
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,490
rooms above, filling them with hopelessness.

508
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,380
Mary could bear it no longer.

509
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,510
She touched her uncle on the shoulder, and
he turned to her, his face red with the heat

510
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,930
of the room.

511
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,810
'I can't stand this,' she said.

512
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,240
'You'll have to serve your friends yourself.

513
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,040
I'm going upstairs to my room.'

514
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,190
'Had enough of it, have you?

515
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,780
Think yourself too good for us?

516
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:26,060
Get out, then; it's nearly midnight, in any
case, and I don't want you.

517
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,440
You'll lock your door tonight, Mary.

518
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,780
Your aunt's been in bed for an hour with the
bedclothes over her head.'

519
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:42,570
He lowered his voice; bending down to her
ear and seizing her wrist, he twisted it behind

520
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,890
her back until she cried out in pain.

521
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:51,390
'Keep your mouth shut and I'll treat you gently.

522
00:41:51,390 --> 00:42:00,720
It is unwise to put your nose in where it
is not wanted at Jamaica Inn, and you'd better

523
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,780
remember that.'

524
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:11,730
Mary ran out of the room, shutting the door
hard behind her, and as she went up the stairs,

525
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,660
her hands over her ears, she could not keep
out that sound of laughter and wild singing

526
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,470
that sounded down the empty passage, following
her to her room and even coming up through

527
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,120
the cracks between the floorboards.

528
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,360
Then she did as her uncle had told her.

529
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:35,210
She undressed hurriedly and crept into bed,
pulling the bedclothes over her head and putting

530
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:42,930
her fingers in her ears, her only thought
now to shut out the noise below.

531
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,170
She slept.

532
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:50,580
Then, without warning, she was suddenly awake,
sitting up in bed.

533
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:58,310
She listened, hearing nothing at first except
the beating of her own heart, but in a few

534
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:06,160
minutes there came another sound, from beneath
her room this time - the sound of heavy objects

535
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,820
being dragged along the stone floor in the
passage downstairs.

536
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:17,550
She got out of bed and went to the window,
opening the shutters a crack.

537
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:22,940
By the light of the moon, she could see five
wagons in the yard outside.

538
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:30,700
Three were covered, each pulled by a pair
of horses, and the remaining two were not.

539
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:37,540
One of the covered wagons stood directly beneath
the window, and the horses were steaming.

540
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,460
Around the wagons were some of the men who
had been drinking in the bar earlier in the

541
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
evening.

542
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:48,300
And there were strangers in the yard whom
Mary had never seen before.

543
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,510
She watched and began to understand.

544
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,840
Packages and boxes were brought by the wagons
and unloaded at Jamaica Inn.

545
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,140
They were now being stored in the locked room.

546
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,540
Everything was done in complete silence; the
men who had shouted and sung earlier that

547
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:15,340
night were now quiet and serious, their thoughts
on nothing but the job.

548
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,859
Joss Merlyn came out of the front door, the
pedlar at his side.

549
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:28,369
'Is that everything?' he called softly, and
the driver of the last wagon waved and held

550
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,700
up his hand.

551
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:37,230
So the wagons moved away from Jamaica Inn,
moving out of the yard one after another,

552
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,990
some turning north and some south when they
came out on to the road, until they had all

553
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:48,760
gone, and there was no one left standing in
the yard but one man whom Mary had not seen

554
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,440
before, the pedlar, and the landlord of Jamaica
Inn himself.

555
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,780
Then they, too, turned and went back into
the house.

556
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:04,270
She heard them go along the passage in the
direction of the bar, and then a door closed.

557
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:09,930
There was no other sound except that of the
big clock in the hall, which rang the hour

558
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,440
- three o'clock.

559
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,080
Mary came away from the window and sat down
on the bed.

560
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,930
The cold air blew in onto her shoulders, and
she trembled.

561
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,290
This was smuggling on a grand scale.

562
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:33,859
Had Joss Merlyn the necessary brain and skills
to lead such a business?

563
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:39,030
Had he been making preparations for tonight's
work during the past week, when he was away

564
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,750
from home?

565
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:47,820
The men working for him must be carefully
picked, in spite of their wild appearance,

566
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,910
and the whole business carefully controlled,
or they could never have escaped the law for

567
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,119
so long.

568
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:01,710
A magistrate who suspected smuggling would
surely have suspected the inn unless he were

569
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,690
involved himself.

570
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:08,970
If it were not for Aunt Patience, she would
walk out of the inn now, find her way to the

571
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,480
nearest town and give information about Joss
Merlyn.

572
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,869
He would soon be in prison, and the rest of
them with him, and there would be an end to

573
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:20,040
the trade.

574
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:28,180
But had she seen only part of the business,
and was there still more for her to learn?

575
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,970
She remembered the fear in Aunt Patience's
eyes, and those words spoken when the shadows

576
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:41,600
crept across the kitchen floor: 'There are
things happen at Jamaica Inn, Mary that I've

577
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,590
never dared to breathe a word about.

578
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,380
Bad things.

579
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,170
Evil things.

580
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,170
I can't ever tell you.

581
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,700
I can't even admit them to myself.'

582
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:02,741
And she had climbed the stairs to her room,
dragging her feet as she went, like an old

583
00:47:02,741 --> 00:47:04,070
woman.

584
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:11,580
Smuggling was dangerous; it was dishonest;
it was strictly forbidden by the law of the

585
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,430
land; but was it evil?

586
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:20,420
Mary needed advice, and there was no one she
could ask.

587
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:27,060
Here she was, a girl of twenty-three, with
no weapons except her own brain to fight a

588
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,150
man twice her size and eight times her strength.

589
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:38,500
'I'll not show fear before Joss Merlyn or
any man,' she said.

590
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:44,880
'I will go down now and take a look at them
in the bar, and if they kill me it will be

591
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
my own fault.'

592
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:54,000
She dressed hurriedly, and then, opening her
bedroom door, she stood and listened for a

593
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,910
moment, hearing nothing but the sound of the
clock in the hall.

594
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:03,080
She crept out into the passage, and came to
the stairs.

595
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:09,109
By now, she knew that the third step from
the top would make a noise, and so would the

596
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:10,849
last.

597
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:17,640
She stepped gently, and so she came to the
dark hall by the front door, empty except

598
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,050
for one unsteady chair and the great clock.

599
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:29,060
As she paused, a sudden beam of light shone
into the passage, and she heard voices.

600
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,250
The door of the bar had swung open.

601
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:37,690
The men must be sitting in silence on the
seats against the outside wall, because she

602
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,750
could not see or hear them.

603
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:48,270
Then suddenly a voice rang out, high and trembling,
the voice of a stranger.

604
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,250
'No, and no again.

605
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,310
I tell you for the last time, I'll have no
part in it.

606
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,990
I'll break with you now, and forever, and
put an end to the agreement.

607
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:06,570
That's murder you want me to do, Mr Merlyn;
there's no other name for it - it's common

608
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,440
murder.'

609
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,480
Someone - the landlord himself, no doubt - answered
in a low voice.

610
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,250
Mary could not catch his words, but his speech
was broken by a burst of laughter that she

611
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,230
recognized as belonging to the pedlar.

612
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:30,180
He must have asked a question because the
stranger's voice was heard again.

613
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,119
'Hanging, is it?

614
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:36,180
I've risked hanging before, and I'm not afraid
for my neck.

615
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,750
No, I'm thinking of my soul and of God above.

616
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:47,849
When it comes to the killing of harmless people,
and perhaps women and children among them,

617
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:54,630
that's evil, joss Merlyn, and you know it
as well as I do.'

618
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:01,230
Mary heard the sound of a chair being pulled
back, and the man rising to his feet; then

619
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,610
her uncle raised his voice for the first time.

620
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:12,080
'Not so fast, my friend,' he said, 'not so
fast!

621
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,210
You're in this business as far as you can
be.

622
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:25,230
I tell you there's no going back now; it's
too late; too late for you and for all of

623
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,230
us.

624
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,859
I've been doubtful of you from the first,
with your gentleman's ways and your clean

625
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,599
shirts, and by God I've proved myself right.

626
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,740
Harry, lock the door over there and put the
bar across it.'

627
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:48,609
There was a sudden cry, and the sound of someone
falling, and at the same time, the table crashed

628
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:50,930
to the floor.

629
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:56,220
Once more, the pedlar laughed his disgusting
laugh, and he began to whistle one of his

630
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,220
songs.

631
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:04,010
'Harry, stand where you are by the door, and
put your knife in him if he tries to pass

632
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,010
you.

633
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:14,160
Now, look here, Mr Lawyer-clerk, or whatever
you are, you've made a fool of yourself tonight,

634
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,140
but you're not going to make a fool of me.

635
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:25,770
You'd like to walk out of that door, wouldn't
you, and get on your horse, and ride away

636
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,410
to Bodmin?

637
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:34,940
Yes, and by nine in the morning you'd have
every magistrate in the country at Jamaica

638
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,050
Inn, and a group of soldiers too.

639
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:42,960
That's your fine idea, isn't it?'

640
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,910
Mary could hear the stranger breathing heavily,
and he must have been hurt; for when his voice

641
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:52,620
came, it was sharp but faint.

642
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,350
'Do your devil's work if you must.

643
00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:01,270
I can't stop you, and I give you my word that
I'll not give information about you.

644
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:07,750
But join you I will not, and there's my last
word to you both.'

645
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:13,820
There was a silence, and then Joss Merlyn
spoke again.

646
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,910
'Take care,' he said softly.

647
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:26,610
'I heard another man say that once, and five
minutes later he was walking in air.

648
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:33,859
On the end of a rope, it was, my friend, and
his big toe just missed the floor.

649
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:40,720
I asked him if he liked to be so near the
ground, but he didn't answer.

650
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,680
The rope forced the tongue out of his mouth,
and he bit it in two.

651
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:57,420
They said afterwards that he had taken seven
and three-quarter minutes to die.'

652
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,970
Outside in the passage, Mary felt herself
go cold and her arms and legs were suddenly

653
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,320
as heavy as lead.

654
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:12,940
With a growing sense of fear she realized
that she was probably going to faint.

655
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,200
Her uncle's voice came from very far away.

656
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,130
'Leave me alone with him, Harry,' he said.

657
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,940
'There'll be no more work for you tonight
at Jamaica Inn.

658
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,010
Take his horse and go.

659
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,599
I'll settle this business by myself.'

660
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:39,170
Somehow, Mary found her way back down the
passage and, hardly knowing what she was doing,

661
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:44,280
she turned the handle of a door in the hall
and fell inside.

662
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:51,250
She must have fainted and been unconscious
for a minute or two, before she sat up again.

663
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:56,950
She heard the sound of a horse in the yard
outside, Harry the pedlar riding away, and

664
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,500
then a sound from above made her lift her
head.

665
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:07,260
A floorboard once, and then again: quiet footsteps
above.

666
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,750
Mary's heart began to beat faster, and her
breath came quickly.

667
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,940
Whoever was hiding up above must have been
there for hours.

668
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:22,339
He must have hidden so that he would remain
unseen by the smugglers.

669
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:27,980
Someone - a friend perhaps - was hiding in
the room next to her bedroom, and could help

670
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,490
her to save the stranger in the bar.

671
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:38,510
But as she waited, trembling, she heard the
landlord pass across the hall and climb the

672
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,030
stairs.

673
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,040
His footsteps stopped above her head.

674
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:49,280
Then he knocked, very softly, on the door.

675
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,000
Once more the floorboard made a noise as someone
crossed the floor, and the door was opened

676
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,640
from inside.

677
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,200
Mary's heart sank, and her misery returned.

678
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,750
Her uncle had known him to be there all the
time and that was why he had sent the pedlar

679
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,190
away.

680
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,460
He did not wish the pedlar to see his friend.

681
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,680
Now they were coming down the stairs; they
stopped for a moment outside the door of the

682
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:24,270
room that Mary had entered, and for a moment,
she thought that they were coming inside.

683
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:30,310
They were so close to her that she could have
touched her uncle on the shoulder through

684
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,839
the crack of the door.

685
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:37,620
Then he spoke, and his voice whispered right
against her ear.

686
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,500
'You must say.

687
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,980
It's your judgment now, not mine.

688
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,500
I'll do it, or we'll do it between us.

689
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,530
It's you who must say the word.'

690
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:57,580
Hidden as she was by the door, Mary could
neither see nor hear her uncle's new companion,

691
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,500
and whatever sign he made in reply escaped
her.

692
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:06,710
They did not stay outside the room, but went
off along the passage to the bar.

693
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:12,339
Then the door closed, and she heard them no
more.

694
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:18,849
Her first desire was to run out into the road,
and so away from them, but she soon realized

695
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:24,540
that by doing that she would gain nothing;
quite possibly there might be other men on

696
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,160
guard along the high road.

697
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:33,210
She must have stood for ten minutes or more
waiting for some sound or signal, but everything

698
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,260
was still.

699
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,869
Only the clock in the hall made its usual
noises, unaffected by events.

700
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:44,480
Then she went out into the dark passage.

701
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,300
No crack of light came out under the door
to the bar.

702
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,440
She laid her ear against it.

703
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,910
There was no sound.

704
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,920
Through the keyhole came a steady current
of cold air.

705
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,369
Mary thought for a moment; then she opened
the door and stepped into the room.

706
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:08,000
There was nobody there.

707
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,380
The door leading to the yard was open, and
the room was filled with fresh November air.

708
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:20,980
The seats were empty, and the table that had
crashed to the ground still lay on the floor,

709
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,880
its legs pointing to the ceiling.

710
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:31,230
A last little beam of moonlight made a white
circle on the floor, and into the circle moved

711
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,970
a dark shape like a finger.

712
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,670
It was a shadow.

713
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:44,060
Mary looked up to the ceiling and saw that
a rope had been thrown over a hook in a beam.

714
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:49,829
It was the rope's end that made the shadow
in the circle; and it kept moving backwards

715
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:57,200
and forwards, blown by the wind from the open
door.

716
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,840
CHAPTER FIVE
Jem Merlyn

717
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:09,530
As the days passed, Mary Yellan settled down
to life at Jamaica Inn with a sense of determination.

718
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:14,050
It was clear that she could not leave her
aunt to face the winter alone; she must make

719
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,329
the best of the six months that lay ahead.

720
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:23,820
If possible, she was determined to defeat
her uncle and deliver him and his companions

721
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,820
to the law.

722
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:31,010
The events of that first Saturday night were
never far from her mind, and the meaning of

723
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:34,220
the rope's end hanging from the beam was clear.

724
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:40,880
Mary had no doubt that the stranger had been
killed by her uncle and another man, and his

725
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,660
body buried somewhere on the moors.

726
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:50,980
There was nothing to prove it, though, and
in the light of day, the story seemed unlikely.

727
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:57,350
Two weeks went by, and there was no Saturday
night like the first one.

728
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,130
No one came to the inn.

729
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:05,940
The future seemed very black at times, especially
as Aunt Patience made little effort to be

730
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:11,589
a close companion; and though now and again
she took hold of Mary's hand, telling her

731
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:17,570
how glad she was to have her in the house,
most of the time the poor woman existed in

732
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:24,500
a dream, going about her duties without thinking
and rarely speaking.

733
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:30,080
One morning Mary decided to clean down the
long stone passage that ran the full width

734
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,970
of the back of the house.

735
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:39,460
As she was doing this, she heard the sound
of a horse in the yard, and a moment later,

736
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,020
someone thundered on the closed door of the
bar.

737
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:50,580
No one had come near Jamaica Inn before, and
this knock on the door was an unusual event.

738
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,490
Mary wiped her hands and went into the bar.

739
00:59:53,490 --> 01:00:02,180
A man was sitting there, with a glass in his
hand, which he had calmly filled for himself.

740
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,240
For a few minutes, they considered each other
in silence.

741
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:11,891
Something about him was familiar, and Mary
wondered where she had seen him before.

742
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:20,510
The heavy eyes, the curve of his mouth, and
the shape of his jaw, even the look which

743
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,810
he gave her, were known to her and disliked.

744
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:30,960
The sight of him examining her and drinking
at the same time made her angry.

745
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,220
'What do you think you're doing?' she said.

746
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,829
'You haven't any right to walk in here and
help yourself.'

747
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:44,370
The man finished his drink, and held out his
glass to be refilled.

748
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:52,490
'Since when have they kept a bar girl at Jamaica
Inn?' he asked her, and, feeling in his pocket

749
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:59,150
for a pipe, he lit it, blowing a great cloud
of smoke in her face.

750
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:05,720
His manner angered Mary even more, and she
leant forward and pulled the pipe out of his

751
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,710
hand, throwing it behind her onto the floor,
where it broke.

752
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:14,329
Is this how they train you to serve your customers?

753
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:18,130
I don't think much of their choice.

754
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,849
Fill up my glass!

755
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:23,410
That's what you're here for, isn't it?' he
said.

756
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:30,280
'As you seem to know your way about here,
you can fill your own glass.

757
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,640
I'll tell Mr Merlyn you are in the bar, and
he can serve you himself if he likes.'

758
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,589
'Oh, don't worry Joss.

759
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:41,790
What's happened to his wife?

760
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:45,550
Has he sent her away to make room for you?

761
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,820
I call that unkind to the poor woman!'

762
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,552
'Do you want to speak to the landlord or not?

763
01:01:53,552 --> 01:01:57,300
I can't stand here all day.

764
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:03,650
If you don't want to see him, and you have
finished your drink, you can put your money

765
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:06,079
on the table and leave.'

766
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,710
The man laughed.

767
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:15,410
'Do you give orders to Joss in that way?'
he said.

768
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,150
'He must be a changed man if you do.'

769
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:24,440
'Joss Merlyn is my uncle by marriage,' she
said.

770
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,320
'My name is Mary Yellan, if that means anything
to you.

771
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,630
There's the door behind you.

772
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:33,950
Good morning.'

773
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,240
She left the bar, meeting the landlord himself
in the doorway.

774
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,050
'Oh, it's you, Jem, is it?

775
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,970
What do you want at Jamaica Inn?'

776
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:51,710
He closed the door behind him, leaving Mary
in the passage outside.

777
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:54,030
She went back to her bucket of water.

778
01:02:54,030 --> 01:03:00,619
So that was Jem Merlyn, her uncle's younger
brother.

779
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:07,240
Of course - he had reminded her of her uncle
all through the conversation, though she had

780
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,319
not realized it.

781
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:15,869
He had Joss Merlyn's eyes, without the lines
round them, and he had Joss Merlyn's mouth

782
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:21,180
- firm, though, where the landlord's was weak.

783
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:28,920
He was what Joss Merlyn might have been 18
or 20 years ago, but smaller and neater.

784
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,680
This Jem had the same cruelty in him as his
brother - she could see it in the shape of

785
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,990
his mouth.

786
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:41,800
Aunt Patience had said he was the worst of
the family.

787
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,660
She was so busy that she did not hear the
stones thrown at the window of the room, and

788
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:53,599
it was not until one cracked the glass that,
looking out of the window, she saw Jem Merlyn

789
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,790
standing in the yard beside his horse.

790
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:01,119
Mary unlocked the heavy entrance door and
went out.

791
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,060
'What do you want now?'

792
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,770
she asked him.

793
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:10,100
'Forgive me if I was rude to you just now,'
he said.

794
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:17,010
'Somehow I didn't expect to see a woman at
Jamaica Inn - well, not a young girl like

795
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,010
you.

796
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:24,500
I know I deserve black looks for behaving
as I did, but if you knew my brother as well

797
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,140
as I do you'd understand how I made the mistake.

798
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,780
It looks strange, having a girl at Jamaica
Inn.

799
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,600
Why did you come here in the first place?'

800
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,920
He looked serious now, and his likeness to
Joss had gone for the moment.

801
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,720
She wished he were not a Merlyn.

802
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,070
'I came here to be with my Aunt Patience,'
she said.

803
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:55,690
'My mother died some weeks ago, and I have
no other relative.

804
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:02,609
I'll tell you one thing, Mr Merlyn - I am
thankful my mother isn't alive to see her

805
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:04,150
sister now.'

806
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,619
'You haven't a good opinion of the landlord,
then?'

807
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:11,810
'No, I have not,' she replied.

808
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:17,450
'He's turned my aunt from a laughing, happy
woman into a miserable slave, and I'll never

809
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,609
forgive him for that as long as I live.'

810
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:23,960
'We Merlyns have never been good to our women.

811
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,930
I can remember my father beating my mother
until she couldn't stand.

812
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:31,000
She never left him, though.

813
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,380
When he was hanged at Exeter, she never spoke
a word for three months.

814
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:39,600
Her hair went white with the shock.

815
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:46,480
What she found to love in him, I can't say
- he never asked for her after he'd been taken,

816
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:52,390
and he left all his money to another woman
on the other side of the river.'

817
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,660
Mary was silent.

818
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:58,369
The lack of feeling in his voice shocked her.

819
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:04,160
He spoke without shame or sorrow, and she
supposed that he had been born, like the rest

820
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,130
of his family, without any warmth or gentleness.

821
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:14,270
'How long do you mean to stay at Jamaica Inn?'
he asked suddenly.

822
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,400
'There's not much company for you here.'

823
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,760
'I'm not going away unless I take my aunt
with me.

824
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,430
I'd never leave her alone, after what I have
seen.'

825
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:28,970
'What have you learnt, in your short time?

826
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:30,640
It's quiet enough here.'

827
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,160
Mary thought that he might be trying to make
her talk.

828
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:41,190
It was possible that her uncle had suggested
that his brother should speak to her, hoping

829
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:43,490
in this way to obtain information.

830
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:50,570
'I helped my uncle in the bar one Saturday
night, and I didn't care for the company he

831
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:51,570
kept.'

832
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:55,170
'I don't suppose you did.

833
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:59,140
The men who come to Jamaica Inn have never
been taught manners.

834
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,619
They spend too much time in prison.'

835
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:09,490
'What do you do for a living?' asked Mary
with sudden interest, for he spoke better

836
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,680
than his brother.

837
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:18,490
'I'm a horse thief,' he said cheerfully, 'but
there's not much money in it, really.

838
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,819
My pockets are always empty.'

839
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:27,790
'Aren't you afraid of being caught?' said
Mary.

840
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,589
'Stealing is an awkward thing to prove.

841
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:36,350
Suppose a horse wanders away and his owner
goes to look for him.

842
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:40,589
These moors are full of wild horses and cattle.

843
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:44,140
It's not going to be easy to find his horse.

844
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:53,349
Say the horse had long hair, and one white
foot, and a diamond mark in his ear.

845
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:58,470
Off goes the owner to Launceston market with
his eyes wide open.

846
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:01,980
But he doesn't find his horse.

847
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:11,130
It's there, of course, but its hair is cut
short, its four feet are all the same colour,

848
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:15,610
and the mark in its ear is a square not a
diamond.

849
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:18,209
The owner doesn't look at it twice.

850
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:22,159
That's simple enough, isn't it?'

851
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,929
Mary laughed, in spite of herself.

852
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:31,869
He was so open in his dishonesty that she
could not be angry with him.

853
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:38,159
Jem Merlyn looked at her seriously, and then
he bent towards her, first looking quickly

854
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,829
over her head into the door beyond.

855
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:48,509
'Took here,' he said, 'I'm serious now; you
can forget all the nonsense I've told you.

856
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:54,969
Jamaica Inn is no place for a girl - nor for
any woman, if it comes to that.

857
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:57,900
Why don't you run away?

858
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,519
I could put you on the road to Bodmin.'

859
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:04,679
Mary could almost have trusted him.

860
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:11,130
But she could not forget that he was Joss
Merlyn's brother, and, being that, might deceive

861
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,949
her.

862
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:15,699
Time would show whose side he was on.

863
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:19,509
'I don't need any help,' she said.

864
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:23,269
'I can look after myself.'

865
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:26,339
Jem threw his leg over his horse's back.

866
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:28,909
'All right,' he said.

867
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:30,819
'I won't worry you.

868
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:34,849
My house is the other side of Trewartha Marsh.

869
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:37,849
I shall be there until the spring, at least.

870
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:40,130
Good day to you.'

871
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:47,549
And he was off, and away down the road before
she had time to say a word in reply.

872
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:52,999
Mary went slowly back into the house, and
the cold, dead air of Jamaica Inn closed round

873
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:57,079
her again.

874
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:00,119
CHAPTER SIX
Mr Bassat's Visit

875
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:06,349
That night the wagons came again.

876
01:10:06,349 --> 01:10:11,939
This time they arrived empty, and were loaded
with the last of the goods, which had been

877
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:15,500
left at the inn the time before.

878
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,620
Mary guessed that this was their way of working.

879
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:25,679
The inn was used as a store for a few weeks
at a time and then, when the opportunity came,

880
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:31,489
the wagons set out once more, and the goods
were carried to the riverbank and transported

881
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:34,099
to different places from there.

882
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:41,179
The organization must be a big one, and there
would be agents scattered far and wide who

883
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:43,670
kept the necessary watch on events.

884
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:50,479
It was with a sudden sting of disappointment
that Mary wondered whether the visit of Jem

885
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:55,199
Merlyn to Jamaica Inn that morning had been
important.

886
01:10:55,199 --> 01:11:01,179
How strange that the wagons came so soon after
him!

887
01:11:01,179 --> 01:11:08,530
He had come from Launceston, he said, and
Launceston stood on the riverbank.

888
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,110
Mary was angry with him and with herself.

889
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:21,150
In spite of everything, her last thought before
sleeping had been the possibility of his friendship.

890
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:25,229
She would be a fool if she had hopes of it
now.

891
01:11:25,229 --> 01:11:30,610
Jem might disagree with his brother, but it
was clear that they were both in the same

892
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,610
trade.

893
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:38,840
It was a miserable, bad business in every
way, and here she was in the middle of it

894
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,309
all, with Aunt Patience like a child to be
looked after.

895
01:11:42,309 --> 01:11:46,380
The next few days passed uneventfully.

896
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:54,489
Then there came a fine cold morning when,
for a change, the sun shone in a cloudless

897
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:55,960
sky.

898
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:02,150
Mary, whose spirits always rose at the sight
of the sun, had turned her morning into a

899
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:08,619
washing day; she felt well, and sang as she
worked.

900
01:12:08,619 --> 01:12:14,239
Her uncle had ridden away on the moors somewhere,
and a sense of freedom possessed her whenever

901
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,590
he was away.

902
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:22,640
An urgent knocking at the window made her
look up and she saw Aunt Patience making signs

903
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,420
to her, very white in the face and clearly
frightened.

904
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:32,039
Mary wiped her hands and ran to the back door
of the house.

905
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:38,570
'It's Mr Bassat from North Hill,' Aunt Patience
whispered.

906
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:41,310
'I saw him from the window.

907
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:46,590
He's come on horseback, and another gentleman
with him.

908
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:53,459
Oh, my dear, my dear, what are we going to
do?'

909
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,749
Mary thought quickly.

910
01:12:55,749 --> 01:12:59,110
She was in a very difficult position.

911
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:04,739
If this Mr Bassat represented the law, it
was her one chance of telling someone about

912
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:06,730
her uncle.

913
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:13,719
She could tell him about the wagons and about
everything that she had seen since her arrival.

914
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:17,329
She looked down at the trembling woman at
her side.

915
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:22,159
By now, there was a continuous hammering on
the door.

916
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:29,499
'Mary, if Mr Bassat asks you what you know,
you won't answer him, will you?

917
01:13:29,499 --> 01:13:31,650
I can trust you, can't I?

918
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,190
You'll not tell him of the wagons?

919
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:40,599
If any danger came to Joss, I'd kill myself,
Mary.

920
01:13:40,599 --> 01:13:44,530
There was no argument after that.

921
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,050
Mary opened the heavy entrance door.

922
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:50,559
There were two men outside.

923
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:56,229
One had climbed down from his horse; it was
he who had rained the blows on the door.

924
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:58,639
The other was still on horseback.

925
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:05,050
His face was brown and heavily lined; Mary
judged him to be about fifty years of age.

926
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:09,640
'You don't hurry here, do you?' he called.

927
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,650
'There doesn't seem to be much of a welcome
for travellers.

928
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,130
Is the landlord at home?'

929
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:20,842
'If you please, Mr Bassat, my husband went
out as soon as he had eaten his breakfast,

930
01:14:20,842 --> 01:14:25,039
and whether he will be back before night I
cannot say.'

931
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:26,530
'That's a pity.

932
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:32,099
I wanted a word or two with Mr Joss Merlyn.'

933
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:34,889
Mr Bassat climbed heavily to the ground.

934
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:41,519
'While I'm here I may as well look round,
and I'll tell you here and now it's useless

935
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,249
to refuse me.

936
01:14:43,249 --> 01:14:48,499
I am a magistrate, and I have the necessary
documents.'

937
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:51,650
He pushed his way past the two women.

938
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:56,590
Aunt Patience made a movement as though to
prevent him, but Mary said quietly.

939
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,090
Let him go.

940
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:04,510
If we try to stop him now we shall only anger
him the more.'

941
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:07,909
The rooms were thoroughly explored.

942
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:15,090
The magistrate looked into the dusty corners,
lifted old bags and boxes, examined the stores

943
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:20,130
of food, all the time crying out in anger
and disgust.

944
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:22,469
'Gall this an inn, do you?

945
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:26,280
You haven't even got a bed fit for a cat to
sleep on.

946
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,920
The place is horrible.

947
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,439
What does it mean, eh?

948
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:33,130
Have you lost your tongue, Mrs Merlyn?'

949
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:41,440
The poor woman could not reply; she kept shaking
her head and working her mouth, and Mary knew

950
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,540
that she was wondering what would happen when
they came to the locked room in the passage.

951
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,360
'What about you, young woman?

952
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,840
Have you anything to say?'

953
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,449
'I'm here to look after my aunt.

954
01:15:55,449 --> 01:15:58,400
She's not very strong; you can see that for
yourself.

955
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,909
She's easily frightened.'

956
01:15:59,909 --> 01:16:04,760
'I don't blame her, living in a place like
this.

957
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,449
Well, kindly show me the room that has barred
windows.

958
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:13,780
I noticed it from the yard, and I'd like to
see inside.'

959
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:20,559
'I'm very sorry, sir,' Mary replied, 'but
if you mean the old store room at the end

960
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:24,320
of the passage, I'm afraid the door is locked.

961
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:29,130
My uncle always keeps the key, and where he
puts it I don't know.'

962
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,949
Well, that's easily settled.

963
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:35,189
We'll have the door down in no time.'

964
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:37,920
He went out into the yard to call his servant.

965
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:44,150
In a few minutes, he returned with his man,
Richards, who was carrying an iron bar, which

966
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:47,260
he had found in the stable.

967
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,020
For a few minutes, the door bore every blow.

968
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:56,969
Then there was a splitting of wood and a crash,
and the door gave way.

969
01:16:56,969 --> 01:17:01,670
It was dark of course; the blocked windows
kept the light out.

970
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:08,330
The servant produced a light, and the magistrate
stepped into the room.

971
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:16,000
For a moment there was silence as the magistrate
turned, letting the light shine in every corner,

972
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:23,710
and then, making sounds of annoyance and disappointment,
he faced the little group behind him.

973
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:28,249
'Nothing,' he said; 'nothing at all.

974
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:30,610
The landlord has made a fool of me again.'

975
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:37,059
Except for a pile of empty bags in one corner,
there was nothing in the room.

976
01:17:37,059 --> 01:17:40,499
It was thick with dust.

977
01:17:40,499 --> 01:17:47,239
There was no furniture of any sort, the fireplace
had been blocked up with stones and the floor

978
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:51,050
itself was of stone like the passage outside.

979
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:56,980
On top of the bags lay a length of twisted
rope.

980
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,790
Then the magistrate turned once more into
the passage.

981
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:04,920
'Well, Mr Joss Merlyn has won this time.

982
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,920
I'll admit myself beaten.

983
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,989
Now listen to me,' he said, pointing his whip
at Mary.

984
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:18,820
'This aunt of yours may have lost her tongue,
but you can understand plain English, I hope.

985
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:24,170
Do you mean to tell me you know nothing of
your uncle's business?

986
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:30,749
Does nobody ever call here, by day or night?'

987
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:33,209
Mary looked him straight in the eye.

988
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:37,500
'I've never seen anyone,' she said.

989
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,619
'Have you ever looked into that locked room
before today?'

990
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:43,630
'No.'

991
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:49,160
'Have you any idea why he should keep it locked
up?'

992
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,130
'No, none at all.'

993
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:57,070
'Have you ever heard wheels in the yard by
night?'

994
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,199
'I'm a very heavy sleeper.

995
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,469
Nothing ever wakes me?'

996
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:04,809
'Where does your uncle go when he's away from
home?'

997
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:06,900
'I don't know'

998
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:13,829
'Don't you think it's very strange, to keep
an inn on the main road and then to close

999
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:16,400
your door to every traveller?'

1000
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,260
'My uncle is a very strange man.'

1001
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,550
'That is true.

1002
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:28,400
In fact, he's so strange that half the people
in the countryside won't sleep quietly in

1003
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:34,929
their beds until he's been hanged, like his
father before him.

1004
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:38,159
You can tell him that from me.'

1005
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,260
He climbed onto his horse.

1006
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,389
'One other thing,' he called.

1007
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:51,219
'Have you seen anything of your uncle's younger
brother, Jem Merlyn, of Trewartha?'

1008
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,939
'No,' said Mary steadily.

1009
01:19:53,939 --> 01:19:56,300
'He never comes here.'

1010
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,510
'Oh, doesn't he?

1011
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,949
Well, that's all I want from you this morning.

1012
01:20:01,949 --> 01:20:04,920
'Good day to you both?'

1013
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:14,310
And away the two men went from the yard, and
so on to the road.

1014
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,289
Joss Merlyn returned just before midday.

1015
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:22,079
Mary told him calmly what had happened during
the morning.

1016
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:29,219
He swore and shouted, but he was frightened,
she could see that, and his confidence was

1017
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:30,219
shaken.

1018
01:20:30,219 --> 01:20:34,079
'Get me something to eat,' he said.

1019
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,610
'I must go out again, and there's no time
to waste.

1020
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:45,419
You've done well today, Mary, and I'll not
forget it.'

1021
01:20:45,419 --> 01:20:46,590
She looked him in the eyes.

1022
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:50,659
'You don't think I did it for you, do you?'

1023
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:55,969
'I don't care why you did it; the result's
the same?

1024
01:20:55,969 --> 01:21:04,489
As soon as he had finished his meal, the landlord
rose to his feet and left the kitchen.

1025
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:07,099
Mary watched him cross the moor.

1026
01:21:07,099 --> 01:21:12,880
She thought for a moment, doubting the wisdom
of the sudden plan in her head, and then she

1027
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,959
ran down the field after her uncle.

1028
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:22,170
When she reached the bottom, she bent down
beside the stonewall until his figure crossed

1029
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:29,329
the skyline and disappeared, and then she
jumped up again and followed him, picking

1030
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:31,920
her way across the rough grass and stones.

1031
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:40,400
It was crazy, no doubt, but her idea was to
keep Joss Merlyn in view, and in this way

1032
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,280
to learn something of his secret plan.

1033
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:49,459
After a few miles, she realized how difficult
it was.

1034
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:55,289
She had to keep a good distance between them
in order to remain unseen, and the landlord

1035
01:21:55,289 --> 01:22:00,570
walked at such a speed that before long she
saw that she would be left behind.

1036
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:06,900
The ground was now soft beneath her feet;
the whole of the low- lying plain ahead of

1037
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,449
her was wet with winter rains.

1038
01:22:09,449 --> 01:22:15,070
Her uncle had crossed the worst of the low
ground with the quickness given by many years

1039
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,090
of practice.

1040
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:21,639
Then he was hidden by a big rock and she saw
him no more.

1041
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:28,389
It was impossible to discover the path, which
he had taken across the marsh, but Mary followed

1042
01:22:28,389 --> 01:22:30,810
as best she could.

1043
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:39,310
She was a fool to attempt it, she knew, but
a sort of determined stupidity made her continue.

1044
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:44,469
When she reached the top of the hill, the
evening clouds were thick and the world was

1045
01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:46,260
grey.

1046
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,679
The horizon was hidden.

1047
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:52,300
Mary would never find her uncle now.

1048
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:58,199
She knew herself to be a fool for having gone
so far on a December afternoon; experience

1049
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:05,449
had proved to her that when darkness came
on Bodmin moor it was sudden and without warning.

1050
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:08,829
The low cloud over the marshes was dangerous
too.

1051
01:23:08,829 --> 01:23:14,099
But there was less danger from the marshes
if she kept to the high ground, so, pulling

1052
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:20,519
up her skirt, she walked steadily forward,
feeling the ground with some care when in

1053
01:23:20,519 --> 01:23:25,860
doubt, and avoiding those places where the
grass felt soft and gave way under her feet.

1054
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:32,239
Her legs were heavy, and her feet felt as
if they hardly belonged to her, and her eyes

1055
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,920
felt sunken away back in her head.

1056
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:42,639
She walked on, her head low and her hands
at her side, thinking that the tall grey chimneys

1057
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:48,860
of Jamaica Inn would be, for the first time,
a welcome sight.

1058
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:54,749
The path was wider now, and was crossed by
another running from left to right, and Mary

1059
01:23:54,749 --> 01:24:00,150
stood uncertainly for a few moments, wondering
which to take.

1060
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:07,409
It was then that she heard the sound of a
horse coming out of the darkness to the left.

1061
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:12,539
Mary waited in the middle of the track, and
after some time the horse appeared out of

1062
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:15,510
the low cloud in front of her.

1063
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:20,739
The horseman turned sharply to the side as
he saw Mary, and stopped.

1064
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:24,510
'Hello,' he cried, 'who's there?

1065
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,460
Is anyone in trouble?'

1066
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:31,949
Then, looking down closely, he said in surprise,
'A woman!

1067
01:24:31,949 --> 01:24:37,489
What in the world are you doing out here?'

1068
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:39,519
'Can you help me to find the road?

1069
01:24:39,519 --> 01:24:43,119
I'm miles from home and hopelessly lost.'

1070
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,090
'Steady there!' he said to his horse.

1071
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,611
'Stand still, will you?

1072
01:24:48,611 --> 01:24:52,829
Where have you come from?

1073
01:24:52,829 --> 01:24:56,300
Of course I will help you if I can.'

1074
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,989
His voice was low and gentle.

1075
01:24:58,989 --> 01:25:05,789
'I live at Jamaica Inn,' she said, and as
soon as the words were out of her mouth, she

1076
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:08,010
wished she had not said them.

1077
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:15,199
For a moment, the man was silent, but when
he spoke again his voice had not changed,

1078
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,960
but was quiet and gentle as before.

1079
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,179
'Jamaica Inn?' he said.

1080
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:24,750
'You've come a long way in the wrong direction,
I'm afraid.

1081
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,860
You're tired out.

1082
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:33,030
You're not fit to walk another step; and what's
more, I'm not going to let you.

1083
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:36,919
We're not far from the village, and you shall
ride there.

1084
01:25:36,919 --> 01:25:42,999
You shall come home with me, and dry your
clothes and rest a little and have some supper

1085
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:47,760
before I take you back myself to Jamaica Inn.'

1086
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:54,579
He spoke with such kindness, but with such
firmness, that Mary trusted him.

1087
01:25:54,579 --> 01:25:58,479
Then she saw his eyes for the first time beneath
the edge of his hat.

1088
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:06,619
They were strange eyes, like glass, and so
pale in colour that they seemed near to white.

1089
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:13,420
His hair was white, too, under his black hat,
and Mary looked at him in some surprise, because

1090
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:18,300
his face was unlined and his voice was not
that of an old man.

1091
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:25,820
Then, with sudden embarrassment, she understood,
and she turned away her eyes.

1092
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:28,400
He was an albino.

1093
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,619
He took off his hat.

1094
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:35,030
'Perhaps I had better introduce myself,' he
said with a smile.

1095
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:40,630
'Even if the meeting is unusual, it is the
right thing to do I believe.

1096
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:50,000
My name is Francis Davey, and I am the Vicar
of Altarnun.'

1097
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,650
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Vicar of Altarnun

1098
01:26:55,650 --> 01:27:00,050
There was something strangely peaceful about
his house.

1099
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,969
Mary stretched out her hands towards the fire.

1100
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:08,699
The silence pleased her; it took away her
fear.

1101
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:13,730
She watched Francis Davey as he laid the table
for supper.

1102
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,469
'Hannah lives in the village,' he said.

1103
01:27:16,469 --> 01:27:19,320
'She leaves every afternoon at four.

1104
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,689
I prefer to be by myself.

1105
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:28,630
I like getting my own supper, and then I can
choose my own time.'

1106
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:34,360
She had not yet become used to his white hair
and his eyes; his black clothes made them

1107
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,039
even more noticeable.

1108
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:41,110
She was tired, but she swallowed her supper.

1109
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:44,679
He poured her out a steaming cup of tea.

1110
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:50,550
Now and again, she took a quick look at him,
but he seemed to sense it immediately, for

1111
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:55,889
he would turn, his eyes on her with their
cold white look - like that of a blind man

1112
01:27:55,889 --> 01:27:57,909
- and she would look away again.

1113
01:27:57,909 --> 01:28:05,409
The warmth of the room and the hot tea made
her sleepy, and his gentle voice came from

1114
01:28:05,409 --> 01:28:06,570
far away.

1115
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:10,920
'Why were you wandering on the moor tonight?'

1116
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:17,719
Hardly knowing how it happened, she heard
her voice reply to his.

1117
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:20,830
'I'm in terrible trouble,' she said.

1118
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:25,880
'Sometimes I think I shall become like my
aunt, and go out of my mind.

1119
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:32,159
I've not been at Jamaica Inn much more than
a month, but it seems like twenty years.

1120
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:37,390
It's my aunt that worries me; if only I could
take her away!

1121
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:42,929
But she won't leave Uncle Joss, in spite of
his treatment of her.

1122
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:48,869
Every night when I go to bed I wonder if I
shall wake up and hear the wagons.

1123
01:28:48,869 --> 01:28:55,110
The first time they came, there were six or
seven of them, and they brought great packages

1124
01:28:55,110 --> 01:29:00,999
and boxes that the men stored in the locked
room at the end of the passage.

1125
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:08,400
A man was killed that night; I saw the rope
hanging from a beam downstairs.'

1126
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,360
She stopped, the warm colour flooding her
face.

1127
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,130
'I've never told anyone before.

1128
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:17,400
It had to come out.

1129
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,469
I couldn't keep it to myself any longer.

1130
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:24,050
I've done something terrible.'

1131
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:30,669
For a moment or two, he did not answer; then
he spoke gently and slowly.

1132
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:33,130
'Don't be afraid.

1133
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:39,320
Your secret is safe; no one shall know of
this but me.

1134
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:45,989
When you have rested, I'll take you back,
and I'll make your excuses to the landlord

1135
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:47,100
if you wish.'

1136
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:52,010
'Oh, you mustn't do that,' said Mary quickly.

1137
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:59,235
'If he suspects half of what I've done tonight
he would kill me and you too.

1138
01:29:59,235 --> 01:30:01,269
You don't understand.

1139
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:05,469
He's a violent man, and nothing would stop
him.'

1140
01:30:05,469 --> 01:30:12,199
'Isn't your imagination running away with
you a little?' said the vicar.

1141
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:18,849
'This is the nineteenth century, you know,
and men don't murder one another without reason.

1142
01:30:18,849 --> 01:30:27,360
Having gone so far, don't you think you had
better let me hear the rest of your story?

1143
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:34,159
'What is your name, and why are you living
at Jamaica Inn?'

1144
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:40,959
Mary looked up at the pale eyes in the colourless
face, at his white hair, and she thought again

1145
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:48,559
how strange he was, this man who might be
twenty-one, who might be sixty, and who with

1146
01:30:48,559 --> 01:30:55,159
his soft voice could persuade her to admit
every secret she possessed if he wanted.

1147
01:30:55,159 --> 01:31:01,520
She could trust him; that, at least, was certain.

1148
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:07,320
The first part of her story was told in short
and broken sentences, beginning with that

1149
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:13,110
first Saturday night at the bar, and then
working backwards to her arrival at the inn.

1150
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:21,539
Her report did not sound true, even to her
who knew the truth of it, and she was so tired

1151
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:26,939
that she often could not find the words, but
paused for thought and then went back in her

1152
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,019
story and repeated herself.

1153
01:31:29,019 --> 01:31:36,239
He heard her to the end with patience, but
all the time she felt his eyes watching her,

1154
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:42,300
and he had a habit of swallowing from time
to time, which she came to recognize, and

1155
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,830
wait for.

1156
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:50,689
When she had finished, the vicar got up from
his chair and began to walk around the room.

1157
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:59,880
'I believe you, of course,' he said, after
a moment or so, 'but your story wouldn't be

1158
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,719
believed in a court of law.

1159
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:10,679
And another thing - it's wrong, we all know
that, but smuggling goes on all over the country,

1160
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:14,309
and half the magistrates make a profit out
of it.

1161
01:32:14,309 --> 01:32:16,409
That shocks you, doesn't it?

1162
01:32:16,409 --> 01:32:20,469
But you can be sure that it's the truth.

1163
01:32:20,469 --> 01:32:27,139
I have met Mr Bassat once or twice, and I
believe him to be an honest sort of man, but

1164
01:32:27,139 --> 01:32:30,829
between ourselves, a bit of a fool.

1165
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:37,539
I can tell you one thing, though; his visit
will have frightened your uncle.

1166
01:32:37,539 --> 01:32:44,969
There won't be any more wagons to Jamaica
Inn for some time; I think you can be certain

1167
01:32:44,969 --> 01:32:46,449
of that.

1168
01:32:46,449 --> 01:32:49,199
If I were you, I should just wait.

1169
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:57,110
Keep a close watch on your uncle, and when
the wagons do come again you can tell me immediately.

1170
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:00,949
We can then decide together what should be
done.'

1171
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:05,429
'What about the stranger who disappeared?

1172
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:07,320
He was murdered, I'm certain of that.

1173
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:12,229
Do you mean to say that nothing can ever be
done about it?'

1174
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:21,619
'I'm afraid not, unless his body is found,
which is extremely unlikely,' said the vicar.

1175
01:33:21,619 --> 01:33:26,949
'In fact it's quite possible that he was never
killed at all.

1176
01:33:26,949 --> 01:33:33,090
Forgive me, but I think you allowed your imagination
to run away with you over that.

1177
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:37,400
All you saw was a piece of rope remember.

1178
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:44,409
If you had actually seen the man dead, or
even wounded, well, that would be a different

1179
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:45,409
matter.'

1180
01:33:45,409 --> 01:33:48,739
'I heard my uncle threaten him.

1181
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:50,929
Isn't that enough?'

1182
01:33:50,929 --> 01:33:58,289
'My dear child, people threaten one another
every day of the year, but they don't hang

1183
01:33:58,289 --> 01:33:59,289
for it.

1184
01:33:59,289 --> 01:34:00,289
Now listen to me.

1185
01:34:00,289 --> 01:34:05,689
I am your friend, and you can trust me.

1186
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:12,039
If you ever become worried or frightened,
I want you to come and tell me about it.

1187
01:34:12,039 --> 01:34:15,570
Altarnun is only a few miles by the road.

1188
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:19,170
That's agreed between us, isn't it?'

1189
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:21,559
'Thank you very much.'

1190
01:34:21,559 --> 01:34:25,999
'And now I'm going to drive you back to Jamaica
Inn.'

1191
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:33,230
The thought of returning was hateful to Mary,
but it had to be faced.

1192
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:38,590
The night was fine; the dark clouds of the
early evening had passed away, and the sky

1193
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,169
was bright with stars.

1194
01:34:40,169 --> 01:34:43,929
It was a strange, exciting drive.

1195
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:47,059
The wind blew in Mary's face.

1196
01:34:47,059 --> 01:34:54,579
The horse thundered along the hard white road,
and the vicar made no attempt to control it.

1197
01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:56,679
Mary saw that he was smiling.

1198
01:34:56,679 --> 01:35:05,770
'Go on,' he urged the animal, 'go on; you
can go faster than this,' and his voice was

1199
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:10,199
low and excited, as if he were talking to
himself.

1200
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:13,820
The effect was unnatural.

1201
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:17,810
Mary felt as if he were in another world and
had forgotten her existence.

1202
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:25,760
He looked like a bird, bending forward in
his seat; with his clothes blown by the wind,

1203
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,420
his arms were like wings.

1204
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:31,229
He might be any age.

1205
01:35:31,229 --> 01:35:34,560
Then he smiled down at her, and was human
again.

1206
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,320
'I love these moors,' he said.

1207
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:44,550
'If you knew them as well as I do, and had
seen them in every type of weather, winter

1208
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:48,189
and summer, you would love them too.

1209
01:35:48,189 --> 01:35:52,340
They go back a long way in time.

1210
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:55,550
Sometimes I think that they have lived on
from another age.

1211
01:35:55,550 --> 01:36:03,130
The moors were the first things to be made;
afterwards came the forests and the valleys

1212
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:06,869
and the sea.'

1213
01:36:06,869 --> 01:36:11,780
Already Mary could see the tall chimneys of
Jamaica Inn against the sky.

1214
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:15,469
The drive was ended, and the excitement left
her.

1215
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:18,610
The old fear and hatred of her uncle returned.

1216
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:24,719
The vicar stopped his horse just before the
yard, beside a grassy bank.

1217
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:29,829
'There's no sign of anyone,' he said quietly.

1218
01:36:29,829 --> 01:36:33,869
'It's like a house of the dead.

1219
01:36:33,869 --> 01:36:37,550
I'm going to look in at the window.'

1220
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:43,300
She watched him go to the side of the house
and he stood there for a few minutes looking.

1221
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,679
Then he made a sign to her to follow.

1222
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:52,639
'There'll be no argument tonight with the
landlord of Jamaica Inn.'

1223
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:57,889
Mary followed the direction of his eyes and
came forward to the window.

1224
01:36:57,889 --> 01:37:03,840
Joss Merlyn sat at the table unconscious,
his great legs stretched out on either side

1225
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,199
of him, his hat on the back of his head.

1226
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:14,280
He looked straight in front of him at the
light, his eyes fixed like those of a dead

1227
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,280
man.

1228
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:21,820
A bottle lay with its neck broken on the table,
and beside it an empty glass.

1229
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,320
The fire had burnt away to nothing.

1230
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,889
Francis Davey pointed to the door.

1231
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:33,039
'You can walk inside and go upstairs to bed.

1232
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:35,429
Your uncle will not even see you.

1233
01:37:35,429 --> 01:37:38,670
Good night to you, Mary Yellan.

1234
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:47,729
If you're ever in trouble and need me, I shall
be waiting for you at Altarnun.'

1235
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:52,829
Then he turned the corner of the house and
was gone.

1236
01:37:52,829 --> 01:37:57,650
CHAPTER EIGHT
Joss's Dreams

1237
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:02,769
Joss Merlyn was drunk for five days.

1238
01:38:02,769 --> 01:38:08,149
He was unconscious most of the time, and lay
stretched out on a bed in the kitchen that

1239
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:11,420
Mary and her aunt had made up.

1240
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:16,119
He slept with his mouth wide open, and the
sound of his breathing could be heard from

1241
01:38:16,119 --> 01:38:18,000
the bedrooms above.

1242
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,590
At about five in the evening, he would wake
for about half an hour, shouting for drink

1243
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,139
and crying like a child.

1244
01:38:27,139 --> 01:38:34,039
His wife went to him immediately, talking
to him gently, holding a glass to his lips;

1245
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:41,369
and he looked wildly around, talking to himself
and trembling like a frightened dog.

1246
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:46,709
Aunt Patience became another woman, showing
a calm, which Mary would not have believed

1247
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:48,769
her to possess.

1248
01:38:48,769 --> 01:38:54,340
It seemed that every two months or so Joss
Merlyn would have these periods of uncontrolled

1249
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:55,340
drinking.

1250
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:02,039
They were becoming more frequent, and Aunt
Patience was never quite certain when they

1251
01:39:02,039 --> 01:39:04,010
would happen.

1252
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:09,229
On the fifth morning, the wind dropped and
the sun shone, and in spite of the adventure

1253
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:14,320
of a few days before, Mary decided to try
the moors again.

1254
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:19,920
This time she made for the East Moor, walking
towards Kilmar.

1255
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:27,300
With many hours of daylight to come, there
was no danger of being lost.

1256
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:32,709
Mary had walked for an hour or more before
she stopped, her progress barred by a stream

1257
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:35,090
that divided and ran in different directions.

1258
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:40,729
It lay in a valley in the hills, and was surrounded
by marshes.

1259
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:48,349
The country was not unknown to her; looking
out beyond the green face of the tor ahead,

1260
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:53,679
she saw the great hand of Kilmar pointing
its fingers to the sky.

1261
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:59,130
She was looking at Trewartha Moor once again,
where she had wandered that first Saturday,

1262
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:07,590
but this time her face was turned to the southeast,
and the hills looked different in the sunshine.

1263
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:11,409
The stream ran cheerfully over the stones.

1264
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:17,729
As Mary crossed it by a rough bridge, a group
of horses came down the hill beyond and pushed

1265
01:40:17,729 --> 01:40:20,869
into the stream to drink.

1266
01:40:20,869 --> 01:40:26,571
Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a man
following them down the path, carrying a bucket

1267
01:40:26,571 --> 01:40:29,139
in each hand.

1268
01:40:29,139 --> 01:40:35,059
She was about to continue her walk when he
waved a bucket in the air and shouted to her.

1269
01:40:35,059 --> 01:40:38,459
It was Jem Merlyn.

1270
01:40:38,459 --> 01:40:44,599
There was no time to escape, so she stood
where she was until he came to her, looking

1271
01:40:44,599 --> 01:40:50,199
just as his brother must have looked twenty
years ago.

1272
01:40:50,199 --> 01:40:55,050
'So you've found your way to me, have you?'
he said.

1273
01:40:55,050 --> 01:41:00,429
'I didn't expect you so soon, or I'd have
made some bread in your honour.

1274
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:03,199
I haven't washed for three days and I've been
living on potatoes.

1275
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:08,570
Here, take hold of this bucket.'

1276
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:14,170
He pushed one of the buckets into her hand
and ran down to the water after the horses.

1277
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:18,199
'Come out of it!' he shouted.

1278
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:20,909
'Dirtying my drinking water!

1279
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:25,059
Go on, you big black devil.'

1280
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:30,119
He hit the largest of the horses with the
end of the bucket, and they all ran back up

1281
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:32,750
the hill, kicking their feet in the air.

1282
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:40,519
What would you have done if you hadn't found
me at home?' he said, wiping his face on his

1283
01:41:40,519 --> 01:41:42,179
arm.

1284
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,110
Mary could not help smiling.

1285
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:50,690
'I didn't even know you lived here, and I
certainly never walked this way with the intention

1286
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:52,070
of finding you.

1287
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:55,090
I'd have turned left if I'd known.'

1288
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:56,520
'I don't believe you.

1289
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:05,309
You started out with the hope of seeing me,
and it's no use pretending anything different.'

1290
01:42:05,309 --> 01:42:11,469
He led the way up the path and, turning the
corner, they came to a small grey house built

1291
01:42:11,469 --> 01:42:13,110
on the side of the hill.

1292
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:19,619
There were some rough farm buildings at the
back, and a piece of land for potatoes.

1293
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:23,619
She followed him in, bending her head under
the low doorway.

1294
01:42:23,619 --> 01:42:26,919
The room was small and square.

1295
01:42:26,919 --> 01:42:31,349
Mary looked around her in disgust.

1296
01:42:31,349 --> 01:42:34,899
'Don't you ever do any cleaning?'

1297
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:35,979
she asked him.

1298
01:42:35,979 --> 01:42:38,989
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1299
01:42:38,989 --> 01:42:45,090
Leave me that bucket of water and find me
a brush.'

1300
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:47,139
She set to work immediately.

1301
01:42:47,139 --> 01:42:51,199
'How long has your mother been dead?'

1302
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:55,139
'Seven years this Christmas,' he answered.

1303
01:42:55,139 --> 01:43:01,409
'Because of my father being hanged and Matt
drowned and Joss gone off to America and me

1304
01:43:01,409 --> 01:43:08,119
growing up wild, she turned religious, and
used to pray here by the hour, calling on

1305
01:43:08,119 --> 01:43:09,599
the Lord.

1306
01:43:09,599 --> 01:43:13,719
I couldn't bear that, so I ran away to sea.

1307
01:43:13,719 --> 01:43:18,369
But the sea didn't suit my stomach, and I
came back home.

1308
01:43:18,369 --> 01:43:21,149
I found Mother very thin.

1309
01:43:21,149 --> 01:43:25,179
"You ought to eat more, I said.

1310
01:43:25,179 --> 01:43:31,289
But she wouldn't listen to me, so I went off
again and stayed in Plymouth for a time, earning

1311
01:43:31,289 --> 01:43:33,439
a little in my own way.

1312
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:38,199
I came back and found the place empty and
the door locked.

1313
01:43:38,199 --> 01:43:40,630
They told me my mother had died.

1314
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:43,320
She'd been buried three weeks...

1315
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,449
What's the matter?'

1316
01:43:44,449 --> 01:43:49,560
'It'll be a good thing when there's not a
Merlyn left in Cornwall!

1317
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,479
It's better to have disease in a country than
a family like yours.

1318
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,159
You and your brothers were born twisted and
evil.

1319
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:02,769
Do you never think of what your mother must
have suffered?'

1320
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:05,030
Jem looked at her in surprise.

1321
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,949
'Mother was all right.

1322
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:09,630
She never complained.

1323
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:11,219
She was used to us.

1324
01:44:11,219 --> 01:44:15,840
How's the landlord of Jamaica Inn, then?'

1325
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,090
'He's had too much to drink, like his father
before him.'

1326
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:24,719
'That'll be the ruin of Joss,' said his brother
seriously.

1327
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,670
'One day he'll kill himself with drink.

1328
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:29,670
The fool!

1329
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:33,570
Has anything been - happening at Jamaica Inn?'

1330
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:37,800
'We had Mr Bassat from North Hill last week.'

1331
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,679
'You did?

1332
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,349
What did the magistrate have to say to you?'

1333
01:44:42,349 --> 01:44:45,960
'Uncle Joss was away from home.

1334
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:51,280
Mr Bassat was determined to come into the
inn and search the rooms.

1335
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:56,389
He broke down the door at the end of the passage,
but the room was empty.

1336
01:44:56,389 --> 01:45:03,280
He seemed disappointed, and very surprised,
and he rode away in a bad temper.

1337
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:10,380
He asked about you, as it happened, and I
told him I had never seen you.'

1338
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:15,789
Jem's face was without expression as she told
her story, but when she came to the end of

1339
01:45:15,789 --> 01:45:19,789
her sentence, and the mention of himself,
he laughed.

1340
01:45:19,789 --> 01:45:24,679
'Why did you lie to him? he asked.

1341
01:45:24,679 --> 01:45:27,119
'It seemed less trouble at the time.

1342
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:31,889
If I'd thought longer, no doubt I'd have told
him the truth.

1343
01:45:31,889 --> 01:45:35,610
You've got nothing to hide, have you?'

1344
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:43,840
'Nothing much, except that the black horse
you saw by the stream belongs to him.

1345
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:49,659
He was grey last week, and worth a small fortune
to Mr Bassat.

1346
01:45:49,659 --> 01:45:53,649
I'll get a few pounds for him at Launceston
if I'm lucky.

1347
01:45:53,649 --> 01:45:56,769
Come down and have a look at him.'

1348
01:45:56,769 --> 01:45:59,750
They went out into the sun.

1349
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,530
Then Jem spoke again.

1350
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:07,969
'What did Mr Bassat expect to see at Jamaica
Inn?'

1351
01:46:07,969 --> 01:46:11,639
Mary looked him straight in the eyes.

1352
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:16,599
'You ought to know that better than I do,'
she answered.

1353
01:46:16,599 --> 01:46:21,659
It was lucky for Joss that everything had
been moved,' he said quietly.

1354
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:25,260
'It's only a matter of time before they catch
him.

1355
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:31,499
All he does in self-defense is to get drunk,
the fool,'

1356
01:46:31,499 --> 01:46:33,269
Mary said nothing.

1357
01:46:33,269 --> 01:46:38,829
If Jem was trying to trap her by his openness,
he would be disappointed.

1358
01:46:38,829 --> 01:46:44,659
'You must have a good view from that little
room over the front door,' he said.

1359
01:46:44,659 --> 01:46:47,229
'Do they wake you from your sleep?'

1360
01:46:47,229 --> 01:46:51,510
'How do you know that's my room?'

1361
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:54,019
Mary asked quickly.

1362
01:46:54,019 --> 01:46:56,590
She saw the surprise in his eyes.

1363
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:58,070
Then he laughed.

1364
01:46:58,070 --> 01:47:03,599
'The window was wide open when I rode into
the yard the other morning; I've never seen

1365
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:05,380
a window open at Jamaica Inn before.'

1366
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:13,959
The excuse was hardly good enough for Mary,
and a horrible suspicion came into her mind.

1367
01:47:13,959 --> 01:47:20,929
Could it have been Jem who had hidden in the
empty guest room that Saturday night?

1368
01:47:20,929 --> 01:47:23,320
Something went cold inside her.

1369
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:26,860
'What does it matter to you how much I know?

1370
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:31,769
All I think about is getting my aunt away
from the place as soon as possible.

1371
01:47:31,769 --> 01:47:37,559
As for your brother, he can drink himself
to death for all I care.

1372
01:47:37,559 --> 01:47:40,559
His life is his own, and so is his business.

1373
01:47:40,559 --> 01:47:45,059
It's nothing to do with me.'

1374
01:47:45,059 --> 01:47:46,559
Jem whistled.

1375
01:47:46,559 --> 01:47:50,399
'So smuggling doesn't worry you after all?

1376
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:57,399
But supposing he were concerned with other
things - supposing it were a question of life

1377
01:47:57,399 --> 01:48:02,130
and death, and perhaps murder - what then?'

1378
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:07,769
'I don't know what you mean,' said Mary.

1379
01:48:07,769 --> 01:48:11,510
He looked at her for a long time without speaking.

1380
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:17,919
'Perhaps not,' he said at last, 'but you'll
come to know, if you stay long enough.

1381
01:48:17,919 --> 01:48:21,800
Why does your aunt look so pale?

1382
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:26,309
Ask her, next time the wind blows from, the
north-west...

1383
01:48:26,309 --> 01:48:27,939
Why are you going?

1384
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:31,749
It's early yet; it won't be dark until after
four.

1385
01:48:31,749 --> 01:48:34,820
What's the matter with you?'

1386
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:38,469
He took her face in his hands and looked into
her eyes.

1387
01:48:38,469 --> 01:48:41,760
'I believe you're frightened of me.

1388
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:48,159
You think I've got boxes of wine and spirits
and tobacco in the little bedrooms above,

1389
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:53,199
and that I'm going to show them to you, and
then cut your throat.

1390
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,969
That's it, isn't it?

1391
01:48:54,969 --> 01:49:00,320
We're a wild lot, we Merlyns, and Jem is the
worst of us all.

1392
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,520
Is that what you're thinking?'

1393
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,840
She smiled back at him in spite of herself.

1394
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,010
'Something of the sort.

1395
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:14,489
But I'm not afraid of you; you needn't think
that.

1396
01:49:14,489 --> 01:49:18,789
I would even like you, if you didn't remind
me so much of your brother.'

1397
01:49:18,789 --> 01:49:27,649
'I can't help my face,' he said, 'and I'm
a much better-looking man than Joss; you must

1398
01:49:27,649 --> 01:49:29,409
admit that.'

1399
01:49:29,409 --> 01:49:35,769
'Oh, you've confidence enough to make up for
all the other qualities you lack, and I'll

1400
01:49:35,769 --> 01:49:37,329
not argue about your face.

1401
01:49:37,329 --> 01:49:38,729
Now let me go.'

1402
01:49:38,729 --> 01:49:44,179
'Are you coming to Launceston with me on Christmas
Eve?

1403
01:49:44,179 --> 01:49:50,290
'What will you be doing over at Launceston,
Jem Merlyn?'

1404
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:54,300
'Only selling Mr Bassat's horse for him, my
dear.

1405
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,809
Say you'll come.'

1406
01:49:55,809 --> 01:50:00,669
'Supposing you are caught in Launceston with
Mr Bassat's horse?'

1407
01:50:00,669 --> 01:50:04,110
'No one's going to catch me.

1408
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:08,159
Take a risk, Mary; don't you like excitement?

1409
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:12,920
You must be soft, down near Helford.

1410
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:15,729
'All right, Jem Merlyn.

1411
01:50:15,729 --> 01:50:18,610
You needn't think that I'm afraid.

1412
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:23,280
I'd be just as happy imprison as at Jamaica
Inn, anyway.

1413
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,849
How do we get to Launceston?'

1414
01:50:25,849 --> 01:50:32,679
'I'll take you there in my carriage, with
Mr Bassat's horse tied up behind us.'

1415
01:50:32,679 --> 01:50:36,229
Mary was not afraid of him.

1416
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:42,229
To prove it, she would ride beside him to
Launceston on Christmas Eve.

1417
01:50:42,229 --> 01:50:49,539
She walked away up the hill without a backward
look.

1418
01:50:49,539 --> 01:50:54,989
Darkness was falling as she crossed the road
and entered the yard at Jamaica Inn.

1419
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:59,929
The door was opened by her aunt, who seemed
pale and anxious.

1420
01:50:59,929 --> 01:51:03,929
'Your uncle has been asking for you all day.

1421
01:51:03,929 --> 01:51:06,309
Where have you been?'

1422
01:51:06,309 --> 01:51:12,149
'I was walking on the moors - why should Uncle
Joss ask for me?

1423
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:15,670
He never has anything to say to me.'

1424
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:18,829
'You must speak nicely to him.

1425
01:51:18,829 --> 01:51:23,030
This is the bad time, when he's getting over
it.

1426
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:26,610
He'll be bad-tempered - violent perhaps.

1427
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:30,130
You mustn't pay any attention to him at times
like these.

1428
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:32,709
He's not really himself.'

1429
01:51:32,709 --> 01:51:40,829
The long evening passed, and still there was
no call from the landlord.

1430
01:51:40,829 --> 01:51:43,159
Mary's eyes closed in spite of herself.

1431
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:49,399
In a dream, she heard her aunt whisper: 'I'm
going to bed.

1432
01:51:49,399 --> 01:51:54,579
Your uncle must have settled down for the
night.'

1433
01:51:54,579 --> 01:51:57,320
Mary felt sleep come over her.

1434
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:00,639
She dreamed that she was crossing the stream
again.

1435
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:04,559
Her feet were wet.

1436
01:52:04,559 --> 01:52:09,999
It was cold... much too cold... she must climb
up the bank...

1437
01:52:09,999 --> 01:52:15,909
Mary opened her eyes and found that she was
lying on the kitchen floor beside the ashes

1438
01:52:15,909 --> 01:52:17,780
of the fire.

1439
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:19,989
The kitchen was cold.

1440
01:52:19,989 --> 01:52:22,249
The light was low.

1441
01:52:22,249 --> 01:52:26,749
She trembled, and stretched her stiff arms.

1442
01:52:26,749 --> 01:52:34,149
Then she saw the door of the kitchen open
very slowly, little by little.

1443
01:52:34,149 --> 01:52:38,889
Suddenly it was thrown wide open, and Joss
Merlyn stood there.

1444
01:52:38,889 --> 01:52:45,349
At first, she thought that he had not seen
her; his eyes were fixed on the wall in front

1445
01:52:45,349 --> 01:52:46,360
of him.

1446
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:52,820
She bent low, her head beneath the level of
the table, hearing nothing except the steady

1447
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:55,629
beating of her heart.

1448
01:52:55,629 --> 01:52:58,519
Slowly he turned in her direction.

1449
01:52:58,519 --> 01:53:04,789
When his voice came, it was hardly above a
whisper: 'Who's there?

1450
01:53:04,789 --> 01:53:07,709
What are you doing?

1451
01:53:07,709 --> 01:53:11,010
Why don't you speak?'

1452
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:13,380
His face was grey.

1453
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:17,599
His eyes looked towards her without recognition.

1454
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:20,110
Mary did not move.

1455
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:23,320
She waited, holding her breath.

1456
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:29,739
He moved forward into the room, his head bent,
his hands feeling the air, and he crept slowly

1457
01:53:29,739 --> 01:53:35,590
along the floor towards her until Mary could
feel his breath on her face.

1458
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:42,099
'Uncle Joss,' she said softly, 'Uncle Joss...'

1459
01:53:42,099 --> 01:53:49,050
He stayed where he was, looking down at her,
and then he leant forward and touched her.

1460
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:50,369
'Mary?

1461
01:53:50,369 --> 01:53:52,900
Is it you, Mary?

1462
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:55,170
Why don't you speak to me?

1463
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:57,340
Where have they gone?

1464
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:58,989
Have you seen them?'

1465
01:53:58,989 --> 01:54:03,979
'You've made a mistake, Uncle Joss,' she said.

1466
01:54:03,979 --> 01:54:08,040
'There's no one here - only myself.

1467
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,869
Aunt Patience is upstairs.

1468
01:54:09,869 --> 01:54:11,289
Are you ill?

1469
01:54:11,289 --> 01:54:14,550
Can I help you?'

1470
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:19,129
He looked around him in the half-light, searching
the corners of the room.

1471
01:54:19,129 --> 01:54:23,309
'They can't frighten me,' he whispered.

1472
01:54:23,309 --> 01:54:27,730
'Dead men can't harm the living.

1473
01:54:27,730 --> 01:54:30,670
It's dreams; all dreams!

1474
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:37,849
Their faces stand out like living things in
the darkness, and I wake trembling.

1475
01:54:37,849 --> 01:54:50,149
I'm thirsty, Mary; here's the key; go into
the bar and find me something to drink.'

1476
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:54,860
When she got back, he was sitting at the table
with his head in his hands.

1477
01:54:54,860 --> 01:55:01,070
At first, she thought that he was asleep again,
but at the sound of her footsteps, he lifted

1478
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,059
his head.

1479
01:55:03,059 --> 01:55:06,929
She put the bottle and the glass on the table
in front of him.

1480
01:55:06,929 --> 01:55:08,249
He filled the glass.

1481
01:55:08,249 --> 01:55:10,929
'You're a good girl.

1482
01:55:10,929 --> 01:55:14,249
I'm fond of you, Mary.

1483
01:55:14,249 --> 01:55:16,769
You've got sense, and you've got courage.

1484
01:55:16,769 --> 01:55:21,749
They ought to have made you a boy.'

1485
01:55:21,749 --> 01:55:26,130
He swallowed the drink, smiling foolishly.

1486
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:28,269
Then he pointed at the bottle.

1487
01:55:28,269 --> 01:55:31,300
'They pay gold for this.

1488
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:35,239
It's the best that money can buy.

1489
01:55:35,239 --> 01:55:38,190
King George himself hasn't anything better.

1490
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:48,499
They can't catch me, Mary: I'm too clever;
I've been at the game too long.

1491
01:55:48,499 --> 01:55:56,050
There are over a hundred of us now, working
towards the border from the coast.

1492
01:55:56,050 --> 01:56:04,190
I've seen blood in my time, Mary, and I've
seen men killed many times, but this game

1493
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:10,909
beats it all - it's running side by side with
death.'

1494
01:56:10,909 --> 01:56:13,349
He seized hold of Mary's arm.

1495
01:56:13,349 --> 01:56:17,610
'It's that cursed drink that makes a fool
of me.

1496
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:24,010
I'm as weak as a rat when it has hold of me,
you can see that.

1497
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:29,530
And I have dreams; I see things that frighten
me.

1498
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:38,309
I've killed men with my own hands, pushed
them under water with my feet, beaten them

1499
01:56:38,309 --> 01:56:45,629
with rocks and stones, and I've never thought
more about it - I've slept in my bed like

1500
01:56:45,629 --> 01:56:46,959
a child.

1501
01:56:46,959 --> 01:56:55,070
But when I've had too much to drink I see
them in my dreams.

1502
01:56:55,070 --> 01:57:04,930
I see their white-green faces in front of
me, with their eyes eaten by fish; and some

1503
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:11,139
of them are torn, with the flesh hanging off
their bones...'

1504
01:57:11,139 --> 01:57:17,559
His face was close to Mary's, his reddened
eyes looking into hers, and his breath on

1505
01:57:17,559 --> 01:57:19,079
her cheek.

1506
01:57:19,079 --> 01:57:25,999
'Did you never hear of wreckers before?' he
whispered.

1507
01:57:25,999 --> 01:57:34,090
'I've seen men hanging on the ropes of their
ships for safety, shouting in terror at the

1508
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:36,439
sight of the breaking waves.

1509
01:57:36,439 --> 01:57:45,260
Just like flies they are, spread out on the
ropes - little black dots of men.

1510
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:53,570
I've seen the ship break up beneath them,
and the ropes break like thread, and all of

1511
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:59,019
them thrown into the sea, to swim for their
lives.

1512
01:57:59,019 --> 01:58:06,020
But when they reach the shore they're dead
men, Mary.'

1513
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:12,459
He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand;
his eyes never left her face.

1514
01:58:12,459 --> 01:58:17,829
'Dead men tell no stories, Mary.'

1515
01:58:17,829 --> 01:58:24,689
She felt sick, and her hands and her feet
were icy-cold.

1516
01:58:24,689 --> 01:58:31,369
She could see the pale faces of the drowned
men, their arms above their heads; she could

1517
01:58:31,369 --> 01:58:34,409
hear the cries of fear.

1518
01:58:34,409 --> 01:58:35,809
She trembled again.

1519
01:58:35,809 --> 01:58:42,860
She looked at her uncle, and saw that he had
slipped forward in his chair, and his head

1520
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:45,780
had fallen on his chest.

1521
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:51,869
His mouth was wide open, and he breathed noisily
as he slept.

1522
01:58:51,869 --> 01:59:01,769
His arms rested on the table in front of him,
and his hands were folded as if in prayer.

1523
01:59:01,769 --> 01:59:06,649
CHAPTER NINE
Christmas Eve

1524
01:59:06,649 --> 01:59:12,280
On Christmas Eve, the sky was cloudy and threatened
rain.

1525
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:17,169
Mary leant out of the window, and the soft
wet wind blew on her face.

1526
01:59:17,169 --> 01:59:25,099
In an hour's time, Jem Merlyn would be waiting
for her on the moor, to take her to Launceston

1527
01:59:25,099 --> 01:59:26,099
market.

1528
01:59:26,099 --> 01:59:33,550
Whether she met him or not depended on herself,
and she could not make up her mind.

1529
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:38,439
She had grown older in four days, and the
face that looked back at her from her cracked

1530
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:41,090
mirror was pale and tired.

1531
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:45,409
There were dark rings under her eyes.

1532
01:59:45,409 --> 01:59:50,340
Sleep came to her late at night, and she had
no desire for food.

1533
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:56,300
For the first time in her life, she saw a
likeness between herself and Aunt Patience.

1534
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:02,079
If she tightened her mouth and bit her lips,
it could be Aunt Patience who stood there,

1535
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:06,719
with the straight brown hair framing her face.

1536
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:11,579
The habit of working her mouth was an easy
one to catch, as was the continuous twisting

1537
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:14,429
of her hands.

1538
02:00:14,429 --> 02:00:18,769
Mary turned away from the mirror and began
to walk up and down her small room.

1539
02:00:18,769 --> 02:00:25,619
They shared a secret now, a secret that must
never be spoken between them.

1540
02:00:25,619 --> 02:00:31,289
Mary wondered how many years Aunt Patience
had kept that knowledge to herself in silence.

1541
02:00:31,289 --> 02:00:36,369
In her own way, Aunt Patience was a murderer
too.

1542
02:00:36,369 --> 02:00:39,010
She had killed by her silence.

1543
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:42,519
There remained Jem Merlyn.

1544
02:00:42,519 --> 02:00:46,980
He broke into her thoughts against her will,
and she did not want him there.

1545
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:51,039
She had enough on her mind without Jem.

1546
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:53,039
He was too like his brother.

1547
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:58,550
His eyes, and his mouth, and his smile.

1548
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:03,099
She knew why Aunt Patience had made a fool
of herself ten years ago.

1549
02:01:03,099 --> 02:01:06,979
It would be easy enough to fall in love with
Jem Merlyn.

1550
02:01:06,979 --> 02:01:13,459
He was rough; he was rude; he was a thief
and a liar.

1551
02:01:13,459 --> 02:01:21,170
He stood for everything she feared and hated,
but she knew she could love him.

1552
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:27,179
Jem Merlyn was a man, and she was a woman,
and something inside her wanted him.

1553
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:31,460
She knew she would have to see him again.

1554
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:38,519
Today she would go to Launceston, and this
time it was he who would answer her questions;

1555
02:01:38,519 --> 02:01:43,869
he would realize that she was no longer afraid
of the Merlyns, but could destroy them when

1556
02:01:43,869 --> 02:01:45,770
she chose.

1557
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:50,579
And tomorrow - well, tomorrow could take care
of itself.

1558
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:57,159
There was always Francis Davey and his promise;
there would be peace and shelter for her in

1559
02:01:57,159 --> 02:02:00,610
the house at Altarnun.

1560
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:09,059
This was a strange Christmas, she thought,
as she walked across the East Moor.

1561
02:02:09,059 --> 02:02:15,709
In the distance, she saw a little group coming
towards her - the horse, the cart, and two

1562
02:02:15,709 --> 02:02:17,139
horses led behind.

1563
02:02:17,139 --> 02:02:21,909
The driver raised his whip in a signal of
welcome.

1564
02:02:21,909 --> 02:02:24,090
Mary felt the colour in her face.

1565
02:02:24,090 --> 02:02:29,039
He whistled as he came near, and threw a package
at her feet.

1566
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:32,780
'A happy Christmas to you,' he said.

1567
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:37,340
'I had a silver piece in my pocket, so I had
to spend it.

1568
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:40,959
There's a new hat for you.'

1569
02:02:40,959 --> 02:02:45,229
She had meant to be silent on meeting him,
but this made it difficult.

1570
02:02:45,229 --> 02:02:52,059
'That's very kind of you,' she said, 'but
I'm afraid you've wasted your money.'

1571
02:02:52,059 --> 02:02:54,070
'That doesn't worry me.

1572
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:59,369
I'm used to it,' and he looked at her in that
cool way of his.

1573
02:02:59,369 --> 02:03:01,639
'You were here early.

1574
02:03:01,639 --> 02:03:05,280
Were you afraid I'd go without you?'

1575
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,590
She climbed up beside him.

1576
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:12,019
'Mother and I used to drive into Helford once
a week on market days.

1577
02:03:12,019 --> 02:03:14,510
It all seems very long ago.

1578
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:20,419
It hurts me when I think of it, and how we
used to laugh together, even when times were

1579
02:03:20,419 --> 02:03:21,619
bad.

1580
02:03:21,619 --> 02:03:24,409
You wouldn't understand that, of course.

1581
02:03:24,409 --> 02:03:26,300
You've never cared for anything but yourself.'

1582
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:30,510
They rode along in silence.

1583
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:33,079
Jem was playing with his whip.

1584
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:38,090
Mary looked out of the corner of her eye at
his hands, and saw that they were long and

1585
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:44,050
thin; they had the same strength, the same
sensitivity, as his brother's.

1586
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:50,070
These hands attracted her; the others frightened
her.

1587
02:03:50,070 --> 02:03:55,329
She realized for the first time that love
and hate ran side by side; that the borderline

1588
02:03:55,329 --> 02:03:57,809
was thin between them.

1589
02:03:57,809 --> 02:04:00,439
The thought was an unpleasant one.

1590
02:04:00,439 --> 02:04:07,239
Supposing this had been Joss beside her, ten,
twenty years ago.

1591
02:04:07,239 --> 02:04:11,219
She pushed the comparison to the back of her
mind, fearing it.

1592
02:04:11,219 --> 02:04:15,369
She knew now why she hated her uncle.

1593
02:04:15,369 --> 02:04:17,150
His voice interrupted her thoughts.

1594
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:20,909
'What are you looking at?'

1595
02:04:20,909 --> 02:04:22,300
She lifted her eyes.

1596
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:29,369
'I happened to notice your hands,' she said
shortly; 'they are like your brother's...

1597
02:04:29,369 --> 02:04:32,780
How far do we go across the moor?

1598
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:35,480
Isn't that the road over there?'

1599
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:40,530
'We join it lower down and miss two or three
miles of it.

1600
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:44,269
So you notice a man's hands, do you?

1601
02:04:44,269 --> 02:04:46,929
I should never have believed it of you.

1602
02:04:46,929 --> 02:04:51,381
You're a woman after all, then, and not a
half-grown farm boy!

1603
02:04:51,381 --> 02:04:57,999
Are you going to tell me why you have sat
in your room for days, or do you want me to

1604
02:04:57,999 --> 02:04:59,579
guess?

1605
02:04:59,579 --> 02:05:01,789
Women love to be mysterious.'

1606
02:05:01,789 --> 02:05:04,650
'There's no mystery in it.

1607
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:09,979
You asked me last time we met why my aunt
looked as she does.

1608
02:05:09,979 --> 02:05:13,689
Well, I know now, that's all.'

1609
02:05:13,689 --> 02:05:17,419
'What are you going to do about it?'

1610
02:05:17,419 --> 02:05:20,329
Mary said: 'I haven't made up my mind.

1611
02:05:20,329 --> 02:05:23,519
I have to consider Aunt Patience.

1612
02:05:23,519 --> 02:05:27,689
You don't expect me to tell you, do you?'

1613
02:05:27,689 --> 02:05:29,709
'Why not?

1614
02:05:29,709 --> 02:05:31,320
I'm not concerned with Joss.'

1615
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:35,989
'You're his brother, and that's enough for
me.'

1616
02:05:35,989 --> 02:05:40,859
'Do you think I'd waste my time working for
my brother?

1617
02:05:40,859 --> 02:05:43,689
He can put a rope round his own neck.

1618
02:05:43,689 --> 02:05:49,499
I may have helped myself to some tobacco now
and then, and I've smuggled goods, but I'll

1619
02:05:49,499 --> 02:05:56,269
tell you one thing, Mary Yellan, and you can
believe it or not as you like; I've never

1620
02:05:56,269 --> 02:05:59,829
killed a man - yet.'

1621
02:05:59,829 --> 02:06:03,059
He cracked the whip hard over the horse's
head.

1622
02:06:03,059 --> 02:06:09,909
'So you think I wreck ships, do you, and stand
on the shore and watch men drown?

1623
02:06:09,909 --> 02:06:14,250
And then put my hands into their pockets afterwards,
when they're swollen with water?

1624
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:18,010
It makes a pretty picture.'

1625
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:23,659
Whether his anger was pretended or sincere
she could not say, but his mouth was set firmly

1626
02:06:23,659 --> 02:06:28,099
and there was a flaming spot of colour high
on his cheek.

1627
02:06:28,099 --> 02:06:31,939
'You haven't said yet that you don't.'

1628
02:06:31,939 --> 02:06:36,949
'If you believe it of me, why do you drive
with me to Launceston?'

1629
02:06:36,949 --> 02:06:40,939
'Because of your bright eyes, Jem Merlyn!

1630
02:06:40,939 --> 02:06:47,760
I ride with you for no other reason,' and
she met his eyes with a directness that surprised

1631
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:48,760
him.

1632
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:56,469
He laughed at that, and shook his head, and
began whistling again; and suddenly there

1633
02:06:56,469 --> 02:06:59,229
was a relaxed familiarity between them.

1634
02:06:59,229 --> 02:07:03,800
The very directness of her words had deceived
him.

1635
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:09,729
He suspected nothing of the weakness that
lay behind them, and for the moment, they

1636
02:07:09,729 --> 02:07:14,539
were companions in spite of being man and
woman.

1637
02:07:14,539 --> 02:07:21,649
They came now to the road, and as the horse
increased speed, the cart rolled along, with

1638
02:07:21,649 --> 02:07:26,159
the two stolen horses running behind.

1639
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:31,829
It was a happy and rather heated party that
reached Launceston that afternoon.

1640
02:07:31,829 --> 02:07:37,059
Mary had thrown worry and responsibility to
the winds and in spite of her determination

1641
02:07:37,059 --> 02:07:40,699
in the morning; she had given herself to enjoyment.

1642
02:07:40,699 --> 02:07:48,420
Away from the shadow of Jamaica Inn, her natural
youth and high spirits returned.

1643
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:56,559
She laughed because he made her laugh; there
was excitement in the air - a sense of Christmas;

1644
02:07:56,559 --> 02:08:02,129
the streets were filled with people; the little
shops were bright and cheerful.

1645
02:08:02,129 --> 02:08:06,239
This was a world that Mary loved.

1646
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:11,729
She wore the hat that Jem had given her and
even allowed him to tie the ends under her

1647
02:08:11,729 --> 02:08:12,729
chin.

1648
02:08:12,729 --> 02:08:19,059
They had left the horse and carriage at the
top of the town, and now Jem pushed his way

1649
02:08:19,059 --> 02:08:27,189
through the crowd, leading his two stolen
horses, Mary following close behind him.

1650
02:08:27,189 --> 02:08:31,570
He led the way with confidence, making straight
for the main square.

1651
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:37,809
Before long, a man pushed through the crowd
and came up to the horses.

1652
02:08:37,809 --> 02:08:40,869
His voice was loud and important.

1653
02:08:40,869 --> 02:08:46,559
He kept hitting his boot with his whip, and
then pointing to the horses.

1654
02:08:46,559 --> 02:08:48,780
Mary imagined him to be a dealer.

1655
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:55,340
Soon he was joined by a little sharp-eyed
man in a black coat, who now and again touched

1656
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,699
his arm and whispered in his ear.

1657
02:08:57,699 --> 02:09:05,340
Mary saw him look hard at the black horse
that had belonged to Mr Bassat; he went up

1658
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:08,609
to him, and bent down and felt his legs.

1659
02:09:08,609 --> 02:09:13,920
Then he whispered something in the ear of
the loud-voiced man.

1660
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,499
Mary watched him, nervously.

1661
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:22,469
'Where did you get this horse?' said the dealer,
touching Jem on the shoulder.

1662
02:09:22,469 --> 02:09:26,800
'Never on the moors, not with that head and
shoulders.'

1663
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:31,389
'I bought him from old Tim Bray; you remember
Tim?

1664
02:09:31,389 --> 02:09:34,869
He sold his farm last year and went to Dorset.

1665
02:09:34,869 --> 02:09:38,460
Tim always told me I'd get my money back on
this horse.

1666
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:41,109
Have a look at him, won't you?

1667
02:09:41,109 --> 02:09:44,429
But he's not going cheap, I'll tell you that.

1668
02:09:44,429 --> 02:09:49,239
Look at those shoulders; there's quality for
you!

1669
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:54,139
I tell you what, I'll take eighteen pounds
for him.'

1670
02:09:54,139 --> 02:10:01,059
The sharp-eyed man shook his head but the
dealer was interested.

1671
02:10:01,059 --> 02:10:05,960
'Make it fifteen and we might do business,'
he suggested.

1672
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:11,030
'No, eighteen is my price, and no less.'

1673
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:16,340
The dealer talked to his companion, and they
appeared to disagree.

1674
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:23,179
'All right,' the dealer said finally, 'I've
no doubt you're right.

1675
02:10:23,179 --> 02:10:27,519
Perhaps we would be wise to have nothing to
do with it.

1676
02:10:27,519 --> 02:10:30,849
You can keep your horse,' he added to Jem.

1677
02:10:30,849 --> 02:10:33,539
'My friend doesn't like him.

1678
02:10:33,539 --> 02:10:38,159
Take my advice and bring down your price.

1679
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:42,110
If you have him for long you'll be sorry.'

1680
02:10:42,110 --> 02:10:48,469
And he pushed his way through the crowd, with
the sharp-eyed man beside him, and they disappeared

1681
02:10:48,469 --> 02:10:51,149
in the direction of the local hotel.

1682
02:10:51,149 --> 02:10:55,599
Mary was glad to see them go.

1683
02:10:55,599 --> 02:11:02,329
Jem sold the other horse to a cheerful, honest-looking
farmer.

1684
02:11:02,329 --> 02:11:07,899
It began to get dark in the market square,
and the lamps were lit.

1685
02:11:07,899 --> 02:11:12,959
Mary was thinking of going back to the cart
when she heard a woman's voice behind her.

1686
02:11:12,959 --> 02:11:14,699
'Oh, look James!

1687
02:11:14,699 --> 02:11:20,300
Did you ever see such a beautiful horse in
your life?

1688
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:23,689
He holds his head just like poor Beauty did.

1689
02:11:23,689 --> 02:11:33,760
The likeness would be quite striking, only
this animal of course is black.

1690
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,059
What a pity Roger isn't here.

1691
02:11:37,059 --> 02:11:38,090
He's in his meeting.

1692
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:39,889
What do you think of him, James?'

1693
02:11:39,889 --> 02:11:43,449
Her companion said, 'Come on, Maria, I don't
know anything about horses.

1694
02:11:43,449 --> 02:11:46,409
The horse you lost was grey, wasn't it?

1695
02:11:46,409 --> 02:11:49,309
This thing is black, coal black, my dear.

1696
02:11:49,309 --> 02:11:51,659
Do you want to buy him?'

1697
02:11:51,659 --> 02:11:55,679
'It would be such a good Christmas present
for the children.

1698
02:11:55,679 --> 02:12:01,429
They've been begging poor Roger for another
horse ever since Beauty disappeared.

1699
02:12:01,429 --> 02:12:05,219
Ask the price, James, will you?'

1700
02:12:05,219 --> 02:12:06,889
The man came forward.

1701
02:12:06,889 --> 02:12:14,459
'Here, my good man,' he called to Jem, 'do
you want to sell that black horse of yours?

1702
02:12:14,459 --> 02:12:16,749
What is your price?'

1703
02:12:16,749 --> 02:12:19,050
'Twenty-five pounds,' said Jem.

1704
02:12:19,050 --> 02:12:22,340
'I'm not anxious to sell him.

1705
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:25,099
The lady swept towards him.

1706
02:12:25,099 --> 02:12:28,050
'I'll give you thirty for him.

1707
02:12:28,050 --> 02:12:34,909
I'm Mrs Bassat, from North Hill, and I want
the horse as a Christmas present for my children.

1708
02:12:34,909 --> 02:12:41,699
Mr Bassat is in Launceston now, but I want
the horse to be a surprise to him as well.

1709
02:12:41,699 --> 02:12:48,649
My man shall take the horse immediately, and
ride him to North Hill before Mr Bassat leaves

1710
02:12:48,649 --> 02:12:49,980
the town.

1711
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:52,979
Here's the money.'

1712
02:12:52,979 --> 02:12:55,059
Jem took off his hat to her.

1713
02:12:55,059 --> 02:12:58,379
'Thank you, madam,' he said.

1714
02:12:58,379 --> 02:13:02,760
'I hope Mr Bassat will be pleased.

1715
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:05,869
You'll find the horse very safe with children.'

1716
02:13:05,869 --> 02:13:10,189
'Oh, I'm certain he'll be very happy.

1717
02:13:10,189 --> 02:13:15,639
Of course, the horse is not at all like the
one we had stolen.

1718
02:13:15,639 --> 02:13:20,340
Beauty was a fine horse, and worth a great
deal of money.

1719
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:26,239
But this little animal is pretty enough, and
will please the children.

1720
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:29,769
Come along, James; it's getting quite dark.'

1721
02:13:29,769 --> 02:13:34,969
Jem looked quickly over his shoulder, and
touched on the arm a boy who stood behind

1722
02:13:34,969 --> 02:13:36,110
him.

1723
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:39,949
'Here,' he said, 'would you like to earn some
money?'

1724
02:13:39,949 --> 02:13:45,239
The boy showed that he would, his mouth open
in surprise.

1725
02:13:45,239 --> 02:13:51,169
'Hold on to this horse, then, until the servant
comes for him, will you?

1726
02:13:51,169 --> 02:13:53,139
Here, take him.

1727
02:13:53,139 --> 02:13:56,709
A happy Christmas to you!'

1728
02:13:56,709 --> 02:14:05,579
And he was away in a moment, walking quickly
across the square, his hands in his pockets.

1729
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:08,889
Mary followed, ten yards behind.

1730
02:14:08,889 --> 02:14:14,090
She struggled to hide her laughter, and was
near to bursting when they got out of sight

1731
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:15,090
of the people.

1732
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:23,579
'Jem Merlyn, you deserve to be hanged,' she
said, when she could speak again.

1733
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:31,019
'To stand there in the market square and sell
that stolen horse back to Mrs Bassat herself!

1734
02:14:31,019 --> 02:14:36,929
The hair on my head has gone grey with watching
you.'

1735
02:14:36,929 --> 02:14:42,879
He threw back his head and laughed, and she
could not help herself.

1736
02:14:42,879 --> 02:14:46,189
Their laughter filled the street.

1737
02:14:46,189 --> 02:14:48,619
Jem caught her hand.

1738
02:14:48,619 --> 02:14:52,619
'You're glad you came now, aren't you?'

1739
02:14:52,619 --> 02:15:00,369
They threw themselves into the crowded market,
where Jem bought Mary gold rings for her ears.

1740
02:15:00,369 --> 02:15:07,559
They sucked oranges beneath a striped tent,
and had their fortunes told by an old woman.

1741
02:15:07,559 --> 02:15:17,479
'Do not trust a dark stranger,' she said to
Mary, and they looked at each other and laughed

1742
02:15:17,479 --> 02:15:18,479
again.

1743
02:15:18,479 --> 02:15:24,739
'There's blood on your hand, young man,' she
told him.

1744
02:15:24,739 --> 02:15:29,280
'You'll kill a man one day.'

1745
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:35,019
'What did I tell you on the cart this morning?'
said Jem.

1746
02:15:35,019 --> 02:15:39,070
'There's no blood on my hands yet.

1747
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:41,159
Do you believe me now?'

1748
02:15:41,159 --> 02:15:45,480
But she shook her head at him and would not
say.

1749
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:51,289
Drops of rain fell on their faces, but they
did not care.

1750
02:15:51,289 --> 02:15:54,940
The wind rose.

1751
02:15:54,940 --> 02:16:01,329
Jem dragged Mary into the shelter of a doorway,
his arms around her shoulders, and he turned

1752
02:16:01,329 --> 02:16:05,789
her face towards him, and kissed her.

1753
02:16:05,789 --> 02:16:13,699
'Do not trust a dark stranger,' he said, and
he laughed, and kissed her again.

1754
02:16:13,699 --> 02:16:19,550
The night clouds had come up with the rain,
and it was dark in a moment.

1755
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:24,199
'You don't want to ride on an open cart in
this wind, do you?

1756
02:16:24,199 --> 02:16:29,459
It's coming from the coast, and we'll be blown
over on the high ground.

1757
02:16:29,459 --> 02:16:32,550
We'll have to spend the night together in
Launceston.'

1758
02:16:32,550 --> 02:16:33,550
'Very likely!

1759
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:39,840
Go and get the horse and cart, Jem, while
this rain stops for the moment.

1760
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:42,179
I'll wait for you here.'

1761
02:16:42,179 --> 02:16:46,050
'You'll be wet to the skin on the Bodmin road!

1762
02:16:46,050 --> 02:16:50,590
Pretend you're in love with me, can't you?

1763
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:52,340
You'd stay with me then.'

1764
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:58,120
'Are you talking to me like this because I'm
the bar girl at Jamaica Inn?'

1765
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:02,690
'I like the look of you, and that's enough
for any man.

1766
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:06,389
It ought to be enough for a woman, too.'

1767
02:17:06,389 --> 02:17:09,150
'Perhaps it is, for some.

1768
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:12,070
I'm just not made that way.'

1769
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:20,429
'All right, I'll get the horse and cart, and
take you home to your aunt, but I'll kiss

1770
02:17:20,429 --> 02:17:24,880
you first, whether you like it or not.'

1771
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:27,150
He took her face in his hands.

1772
02:17:27,150 --> 02:17:30,969
'One for sorrow, two for joy!

1773
02:17:30,969 --> 02:17:36,139
I'll give you the rest when you are more ready
to accept them.'

1774
02:17:36,139 --> 02:17:42,810
Then he bent his head against the rain and
she saw him disappear round the corner.

1775
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:47,200
Mary waited, moving her feet and blowing on
her hands.

1776
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:52,550
The long minutes passed, and still he did
not come.

1777
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:57,050
Mary was cold and tired.

1778
02:17:57,050 --> 02:18:03,710
At last, she could bear it no longer, and
she set off up the hill in search of him.

1779
02:18:03,710 --> 02:18:09,860
The long street was empty, except for one
or two people who sheltered in doorways as

1780
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:11,840
she had done.

1781
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,940
The rain was continuous, and the wind blew
hard.

1782
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:21,530
There was nothing left now of the Christmas
spirit.

1783
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:27,380
The hotel looked welcoming enough, with its
lighted windows, but there was no sign of

1784
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:28,910
the horse and cart.

1785
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:32,120
Mary's heart sank.

1786
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:35,910
Surely, Jem had not started back without her?

1787
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:43,030
She paused for a moment, and then she went
to the door and entered the hotel.

1788
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:47,440
The hall seemed to be full of gentlemen, talking
and laughing.

1789
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:54,050
Her country clothes and wet hair caused surprise,
and a servant came up to her immediately and

1790
02:18:54,050 --> 02:18:56,610
told her to leave.

1791
02:18:56,610 --> 02:19:00,599
'I've come in search of Mr Jem Merlyn,' said
Mary firmly.

1792
02:19:00,599 --> 02:19:03,620
'He came here with a horse and cart.

1793
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:07,420
I'm sorry to trouble you, but I'm anxious
to find him.

1794
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:11,671
Will you please ask if he's here?'

1795
02:19:11,671 --> 02:19:16,219
She turned her back on the little group of
men who stood by the fire and watched her.

1796
02:19:16,219 --> 02:19:21,660
Among them, she recognized the dealer and
the sharp-eyed man.

1797
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:27,820
'If it's the dark one who tried to sell my
friend a horse this afternoon, I can tell

1798
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:33,730
you about him,' said the little man, showing
a row of broken teeth.

1799
02:19:33,730 --> 02:19:37,960
Laughter came from the group by the fire.

1800
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,820
She looked from one to the other.

1801
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:43,050
'What do you have to say?'

1802
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:49,561
'He was in the company of a gentleman only
ten minutes ago,' answered the sharp-eyed

1803
02:19:49,561 --> 02:19:53,100
man, still smiling, and looking at her rudely.

1804
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:59,550
'With the help of some of us he was persuaded
to enter a carriage that was waiting at the

1805
02:19:59,550 --> 02:20:00,550
door.

1806
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:06,590
He was not keen at first, but a look from
the gentleman appeared to decide him.

1807
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:11,350
No doubt you know what happened to the black
horse?

1808
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:15,710
The price he was asking was undoubtedly high.'

1809
02:20:15,710 --> 02:20:20,301
His remark brought fresh laughter from the
group by the fire.

1810
02:20:20,301 --> 02:20:24,410
Mary looked steadily at the little sharp-eyed
man.

1811
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:26,930
'Do you know where he went?'

1812
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:27,930
'No.

1813
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:33,530
And I'm afraid that your companion left you
no parting message.

1814
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:37,171
But, it is Christmas.

1815
02:20:37,171 --> 02:20:40,061
It's not pleasant weather outside.

1816
02:20:40,061 --> 02:20:46,120
If you'd like to wait here until your friend
returns, myself and these gentlemen will be

1817
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:48,460
happy to entertain you.

1818
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:52,570
Come in and rest, and forget him.'

1819
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:56,771
Mary turned her back on him and went out through
the door once more.

1820
02:20:56,771 --> 02:21:05,170
As it closed behind her, she could hear their
laughter.

1821
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:10,580
She stood in the empty market square with
the wind and the rain for company.

1822
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:15,830
So the worst had happened, and the stolen
horse had been recognized.

1823
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:19,630
There was no other explanation.

1824
02:21:19,630 --> 02:21:20,630
Jem had gone.

1825
02:21:20,630 --> 02:21:26,300
Did they hang men for stealing as well as
for murder?

1826
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:30,280
She felt ill, and her brain was in confusion.

1827
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:32,840
She could make no plans.

1828
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:38,440
She supposed that Jem was lost to her now,
anyway, and she would never see him again.

1829
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:41,260
The adventure was over.

1830
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:49,880
There was no happiness left in Launceston
anymore; it was a cold, grey, hateful place.

1831
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:55,120
She walked along with the rain beating in
her face, caring little where she went, or

1832
02:21:55,120 --> 02:22:00,341
that 11 miles lay between her and her bedroom
at Jamaica Inn.

1833
02:22:00,341 --> 02:22:01,630
She walked on.

1834
02:22:01,630 --> 02:22:08,511
Then out of the darkness, she saw a carriage
coming up the hill.

1835
02:22:08,511 --> 02:22:13,950
Its progress was slow, with the full force
of the wind against it.

1836
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:16,460
She watched it with dull eyes.

1837
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:21,640
It was passing her, when suddenly she ran
after it and called to the driver wrapped

1838
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,400
up in a coat on the seat.

1839
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:26,530
'Are you taking the Bodmin road?

1840
02:22:26,530 --> 02:22:29,140
Have you a passenger inside?'

1841
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:36,380
The driver shook his head and whipped his
horse, but before Mary could step to one side,

1842
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:41,510
an arm came out of the carriage window and
a hand was laid on her shoulder.

1843
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:50,670
'What does Mary Yellan do alone in Launceston
on Christmas Eve?' said a voice from inside.

1844
02:22:50,670 --> 02:22:52,181
The voice was gentle.

1845
02:22:52,181 --> 02:23:00,750
A pale face looked out at her from inside
the carriage; white hair and white eyes beneath

1846
02:23:00,750 --> 02:23:02,710
the broad black hat.

1847
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:08,690
It was the Vicar of Altarnun.

1848
02:23:08,690 --> 02:23:14,830
She watched his face in the darkness; his
thin nose curved down like the beak of a bird,

1849
02:23:14,830 --> 02:23:20,181
his lips narrow and colourless, pressed firmly
together.

1850
02:23:20,181 --> 02:23:25,931
He leant forward with his chin resting on
a walking stick that he held between his knees.

1851
02:23:25,931 --> 02:23:32,000
For the moment, she could see nothing of his
eyes: they were hidden by his short white

1852
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,390
eyelashes.

1853
02:23:34,390 --> 02:23:39,750
Then he turned in his seat and looked at her,
and the eyes that looked at her were white

1854
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:43,240
too, expressionless as glass.

1855
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:52,610
'So we ride together for the second time,'
he said, and his voice was soft and low, like

1856
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:53,940
the voice of a woman.

1857
02:23:53,940 --> 02:24:00,400
'Once more I have the good fortune to help
you on your way.

1858
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:02,141
Well?'

1859
02:24:02,141 --> 02:24:08,910
He looked steadily at her, and she found herself
trying to give an explanation of her day.

1860
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:15,250
As before at Altarnun, there was something
about him that made her sound like a fool,

1861
02:24:15,250 --> 02:24:21,521
for she came out of the story badly - just
another woman who had made herself cheap at

1862
02:24:21,521 --> 02:24:26,980
Launceston market and had been left by the
man of her choice to find her way home alone.

1863
02:24:26,980 --> 02:24:36,570
'What was the name of your companion?' he
asked quietly; and she paused, awkward and

1864
02:24:36,570 --> 02:24:40,601
uncomfortable, her sense of guilt stronger
than ever.

1865
02:24:40,601 --> 02:24:44,820
'He was my uncle s brother.'

1866
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:52,330
'You mean the brother knows nothing of the
landlord's trade by night?'

1867
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:54,400
continued the gentle voice beside her.

1868
02:24:54,400 --> 02:25:00,600
'He is not of the company who bring the wagons
to Jamaica Inn?'

1869
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:03,800
'I don't know,' she said.

1870
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:06,040
'I have no proof.

1871
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:07,760
He admits nothing.

1872
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:13,340
But he told me one thing: that he had never
killed a man.

1873
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:14,630
And I believe him.

1874
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:20,420
He also said that my uncle was running straight
into the hands of the law, and that they would

1875
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:23,080
catch him before long.

1876
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:27,790
He surely would not say that if he were one
of the company.

1877
02:25:27,790 --> 02:25:30,630
You told me before that you knew Mr Bassat.

1878
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:33,350
Perhaps you have some influence with him.

1879
02:25:33,350 --> 02:25:38,561
Could you persuade him to deal kindly with
Jem Merlyn, when the time comes?

1880
02:25:38,561 --> 02:25:42,960
After all, he is young; he could start life
again.

1881
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:45,870
It would be easy for a man in your position.'

1882
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:53,720
'I know Mr Bassat only very slightly,' he
told her gently.

1883
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:59,440
'Once or twice we have spoken of matters which
concern our two villages.

1884
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:07,710
It is hardly likely that he would pardon a
thief because of me, especially if the thief

1885
02:26:07,710 --> 02:26:12,470
is guilty and happens to be the brother of
the landlord of Jamaica Inn.

1886
02:26:12,470 --> 02:26:15,490
How old are you?'

1887
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:16,490
'Twenty-three.'

1888
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:24,850
'You are very young, Mary Yellan,' he said
softly; 'you are nothing but a chicken with

1889
02:26:24,850 --> 02:26:27,590
the broken shell still around you.

1890
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:35,961
Women like you have no need to cry over a
man met once or twice; and a first kiss is

1891
02:26:35,961 --> 02:26:39,050
not a thing to be remembered.

1892
02:26:39,050 --> 02:26:44,570
You will forget your friend with his stolen
horse very soon.

1893
02:26:44,570 --> 02:26:51,990
Come now, dry your eyes; you are not the first
to cry over a lost lover.'

1894
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:55,011
He treated her problem lightly.

1895
02:26:55,011 --> 02:26:59,891
She wondered why he had not used the words
of comfort expected from a priest.

1896
02:26:59,891 --> 02:27:06,150
She remembered that last ride with him, when
he had whipped his horse into a fever of speed,

1897
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:10,970
and how he had bent forward in his seat and
had whispered under his breath words she had

1898
02:27:10,970 --> 02:27:12,470
not understood.

1899
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:18,490
Again, she felt something of the same discomfort,
which she connected with his strange hair

1900
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:24,360
and eyes, as though his unusual appearance
cut him off from the rest of the world.

1901
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:34,120
'So I was right in my guess, and all has been
quiet at Jamaica Inn?' he said after a while.

1902
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:39,760
Immediately she remembered the full story
of the past week, and the new knowledge that

1903
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,590
had come to her.

1904
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:47,760
'Mr Davey she whispered, 'have you ever heard
of wreckers?

1905
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:53,870
It was too dark to see his face, but she heard
him swallow.

1906
02:27:53,870 --> 02:27:57,971
'My uncle is one of them.

1907
02:27:57,971 --> 02:28:01,250
He told me so himself.'

1908
02:28:01,250 --> 02:28:05,870
Still her companion made no reply, and she
went on in a whisper.

1909
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:13,280
'They are in it, every one of them, from the
coast to the river bank, all those men I saw

1910
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:19,490
that first Saturday in the bar at the inn
- the sailors, the thieves, the pedlar with

1911
02:28:19,490 --> 02:28:21,010
the broken teeth.

1912
02:28:21,010 --> 02:28:27,721
They've murdered women and children with their
own hands; they've held them under water;

1913
02:28:27,721 --> 02:28:30,740
they've killed them with rocks and stones.

1914
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:37,350
Those are death wagons that travel the road
by night, and the goods they carry are from

1915
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:41,011
wrecked ships, bought at the price of blood.

1916
02:28:41,011 --> 02:28:47,471
And that's why my uncle is feared and hated
by the people in the houses and farms, and

1917
02:28:47,471 --> 02:28:53,461
why all doors are barred against him, and
why the coaches drive past the inn in a cloud

1918
02:28:53,461 --> 02:28:54,840
of dust.

1919
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:58,391
They suspect what they cannot prove.

1920
02:28:58,391 --> 02:29:05,170
There, Mr Davey; now you know the truth about
Jamaica Inn.'

1921
02:29:05,170 --> 02:29:13,010
'So the landlord talks when he has had too
much drink?' he said, and it seemed to Mary

1922
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:19,420
that his voice lacked something of its usual
gentle quality; but when she looked up at

1923
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:24,860
him his eyes looking back at her were as cold
and expressionless as always.

1924
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:27,710
'He talks, yes.

1925
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:29,470
That's how I know.

1926
02:29:29,470 --> 02:29:35,830
And perhaps that's why I've stopped trusting
people, God and even myself; and why I acted

1927
02:29:35,830 --> 02:29:37,420
like a fool today in Launceston.'

1928
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:43,460
The wind had increased in force.

1929
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:45,890
The carriage shook.

1930
02:29:45,890 --> 02:29:52,210
There was no shelter now; the moor on either
side was empty, and the clouds flew fast over

1931
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:53,340
the land.

1932
02:29:53,340 --> 02:30:00,660
There was a salty wet smell to the wind that
had come from the sea 15 miles away.

1933
02:30:00,660 --> 02:30:03,200
Francis Davey leant forward in his seat.

1934
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:07,090
'We are coming to the turning that leads to
Altarnun.

1935
02:30:07,090 --> 02:30:13,460
The driver is going on to Bodmin and will
take you to Jamaica Inn.

1936
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:17,440
I shall leave you at the turning and walk
down to the village.

1937
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:25,360
Am I the only man to know your secret, or
do I share it with the landlords brother?'

1938
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:28,590
'Jem Merlyn knows,' she said.

1939
02:30:28,590 --> 02:30:31,521
'We spoke of it this morning.

1940
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:36,120
He said little, though, and I know that he
is not friendly with my uncle.

1941
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:39,561
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.

1942
02:30:39,561 --> 02:30:41,570
Jem is going to prison for another crime.'

1943
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:50,740
'And suppose he could save himself by telling
about his brother, what then, Mary Yellan?

1944
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:54,761
There's a thought for you.'

1945
02:30:54,761 --> 02:30:57,040
Mary was surprised by this new idea.

1946
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,261
But the Vicar of Altarnun must have read her
thoughts.

1947
02:31:00,261 --> 02:31:06,380
'That would be a relief to you and to him,
no doubt, if he had never helped with the

1948
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:07,380
wrecking.

1949
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:11,660
But there is always the doubt, isn't there?

1950
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:15,300
And neither you nor I knows the answer.

1951
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:22,590
A guilty man does not usually tie the rope
round his own neck.'

1952
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:27,490
Mary made a helpless movement with her hands,
and he laid his hand on her knee.

1953
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:31,291
'I will tell you one thing to comfort you.

1954
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:35,021
A week from now will bring the New Year.

1955
02:31:35,021 --> 02:31:42,100
The false lights have burnt for the last time,
and there will be no more wrecks.'

1956
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:43,510
'I don t understand you.

1957
02:31:43,510 --> 02:31:49,601
How do you know this, and what has the New
Year to do with it?'

1958
02:31:49,601 --> 02:31:52,980
He called the driver to stop the horse.

1959
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:56,040
'I am returning tonight from a meeting in
Launceston.

1960
02:31:56,040 --> 02:32:02,851
Those of us present were informed that at
last the Government is prepared to guard the

1961
02:32:02,851 --> 02:32:03,851
coast.

1962
02:32:03,851 --> 02:32:09,710
There will be watchers on the cliffs, and
the paths now known only to men like your

1963
02:32:09,710 --> 02:32:13,860
uncle and his companions will be followed
by officers of the law.

1964
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:21,530
There will be a chain across England, Mary,
that will be very hard to break.

1965
02:32:21,530 --> 02:32:24,760
Now do you understand?'

1966
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:29,130
He opened the door of the carriage and stepped
out into the road.

1967
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:31,320
'Your troubles are over.

1968
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:37,630
Tomorrow is Christmas Day, and the bells at
Altarnun will be ringing for peace.

1969
02:32:37,630 --> 02:32:41,311
I shall think of you.'

1970
02:32:41,311 --> 02:32:49,750
He waved his hand to the driver, and the carriage
went on without him.

1971
02:32:49,750 --> 02:32:55,820
There were still 3 miles to go, and those
miles were the wildest of all.

1972
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:58,550
She sat in the corner of the carriage.

1973
02:32:58,550 --> 02:33:04,370
Through the open window, travelling down on
the wind, she heard a shot, and a distant

1974
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:06,010
shout and a cry.

1975
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:10,490
The voices of men came out of the darkness.

1976
02:33:10,490 --> 02:33:13,010
She leant out of the window.

1977
02:33:13,010 --> 02:33:18,580
The road rose steeply from the valley, and
there in the distance were the tall chimneys

1978
02:33:18,580 --> 02:33:21,510
of Jamaica Inn.

1979
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:28,220
Down the road came a company of men, led by
one who carried a light before him as he ran.

1980
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:35,180
Another shot sounded, and the driver of the
carriage slipped over in his seat and fell.

1981
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:40,120
The horse went towards the edge of the road
like a blind thing.

1982
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:44,300
The carriage swung wildly, then was still.

1983
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:49,501
Somebody laughed; there was a whistle and
a cry.

1984
02:33:49,501 --> 02:33:55,521
A face appeared at the carriage window, wild
hair above the reddened eyes.

1985
02:33:55,521 --> 02:34:00,200
The lips were parted to show white teeth.

1986
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:09,250
One hand held a light, the other a smoking
gun; they were long, thin hands, things of

1987
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:15,420
beauty and sensitivity, though the rounded
nails were dirty.

1988
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:21,210
Joss Merlyn laughed; then he pulled her out
beside him on the road, holding the light

1989
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:25,670
above his head so that all could see her.

1990
02:34:25,670 --> 02:34:30,880
There were ten or twelve of them standing
in the road, with torn and dirty clothes,

1991
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:38,771
half of them as much the worse for drink as
their leader, wild eyes rolling in their bearded

1992
02:34:38,771 --> 02:34:44,681
faces; one or two hand guns in their hands,
or were armed with broken bottles, knives

1993
02:34:44,681 --> 02:34:47,180
and stones.

1994
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:53,000
Harry the pedlar stood holding the horses
head, while face-down on the road lay the

1995
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:59,480
driver of the carriage, his arm bent under
him, his body still.

1996
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:05,790
When they saw who she was, a shout of laughter
broke from the men, and the pedlar put two

1997
02:35:05,790 --> 02:35:08,870
fingers to his mouth and whistled.

1998
02:35:08,870 --> 02:35:15,170
The landlord seized her loose hair in his
hand and twisted it like a rope.

1999
02:35:15,170 --> 02:35:18,760
'So its you, is it?

2000
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:24,440
You've chosen to come back again?'

2001
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:26,040
Mary said nothing.

2002
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:31,681
She looked from one to the other of the men
in the crowd and they pushed in on her, laughing,

2003
02:35:31,681 --> 02:35:35,261
pointing to her wet clothes and shouting insults.

2004
02:35:35,261 --> 02:35:39,900
'So you can't talk?'

2005
02:35:39,900 --> 02:35:46,271
cried her uncle, and hit her across the face
with the back of his hand.

2006
02:35:46,271 --> 02:35:52,740
She put up an arm to protect herself, but
he knocked it away and, holding her wrist,

2007
02:35:52,740 --> 02:35:55,490
twisted it behind her back.

2008
02:35:55,490 --> 02:35:59,551
She cried with the pain, and he laughed again.

2009
02:35:59,551 --> 02:36:03,950
'I'll get the better of you, if I kill you
first.

2010
02:36:03,950 --> 02:36:10,670
Do you think you can stand against me, with
your monkey face and your rudeness... and

2011
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:16,550
what do you think you are doing at midnight,
riding in a hired carriage, with your hair

2012
02:36:16,550 --> 02:36:19,430
down your back?'

2013
02:36:19,430 --> 02:36:22,780
He twisted her wrist again, and she fell.

2014
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:25,190
'You're nothing but a common...'

2015
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:27,910
'Leave me alone!'

2016
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:28,910
she cried.

2017
02:36:28,910 --> 02:36:32,771
'You have no right to touch me or speak to
me.

2018
02:36:32,771 --> 02:36:36,552
You're a murderer and a thief, and the law
knows it too.

2019
02:36:36,552 --> 02:36:40,150
The whole of Cornwall knows it.

2020
02:36:40,150 --> 02:36:42,870
Your game is over, Uncle Joss.

2021
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:47,211
I've been to Launceston today to inform against
you.'

2022
02:36:47,211 --> 02:36:54,080
A loud cry came from the group of men; they
pressed forward, shouting at her and questioning,

2023
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:59,420
but the landlord swore at them, waving them
back.

2024
02:36:59,420 --> 02:37:01,410
'Get back, you fools!

2025
02:37:01,410 --> 02:37:07,780
Can't you see she's trying to save herself
by lies?' he thundered.

2026
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:14,620
'How can she give information about me when
she knows nothing?

2027
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:18,021
She's never walked the 11 miles to Launceston.

2028
02:37:18,021 --> 02:37:21,561
Look at her feet.

2029
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:27,870
She's been with a man somewhere down the road,
and he sent her back on wheels.

2030
02:37:27,870 --> 02:37:30,271
Get up!'

2031
02:37:30,271 --> 02:37:32,990
He pulled her to her feet.

2032
02:37:32,990 --> 02:37:38,050
Then he pointed to the sky, where the low
clouds were blown by the wind and a single

2033
02:37:38,050 --> 02:37:39,320
star shone.

2034
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:41,061
'Look there!

2035
02:37:41,061 --> 02:37:45,080
There's a break in the sky, and the wind's
going east.

2036
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:52,090
There'll be more wind still, and a wild grey
morning on the coast in six hours' time.

2037
02:37:52,090 --> 02:37:55,301
We'll waste no more time here.

2038
02:37:55,301 --> 02:38:02,670
Come on, you lazy devils, don't you want to
feel gold and silver run through your hands?

2039
02:38:02,670 --> 02:38:05,211
Who'll come with me?'

2040
02:38:05,211 --> 02:38:10,900
A shout rose, and hands were raised in the
air.

2041
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:15,900
One of the men burst into song, waving a bottle
over his head.

2042
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:19,641
The pedlar pulled at the horse.

2043
02:38:19,641 --> 02:38:26,710
Joss Merlyn stood for a moment, looking at
Mary with a foolish smile, then he pulled

2044
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:31,960
her towards the carriage, threw her on the
seat in the corner, and then, leaning out

2045
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:37,510
of the window, he shouted to the pedlar to
whip the horse up the hill.

2046
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:43,311
His cry was repeated by the men who ran beside
him, and some of them jumped onto the step

2047
02:38:43,311 --> 02:38:47,780
and held onto the empty driver's seat and
hit the horse with sticks.

2048
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:54,900
The animal sped up the hill in its fear, dragging
the carriage behind it.

2049
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:56,090
Jamaica Inn was all lit up.

2050
02:38:56,090 --> 02:39:01,550
The doors and the windows were wide open.

2051
02:39:01,550 --> 02:39:06,750
The landlord placed his hand over Mary's mouth
and forced her back against the side of the

2052
02:39:06,750 --> 02:39:07,750
carriage.

2053
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:10,811
'You'd inform against me, would you?

2054
02:39:10,811 --> 02:39:15,710
You'd run to the law, and have me swinging
on a rope's end?

2055
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:18,521
All right then!

2056
02:39:18,521 --> 02:39:25,360
You shall stand on the shore, Mary, and you
shall watch for the daylight and the coming

2057
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:26,711
in of the tide.

2058
02:39:26,711 --> 02:39:31,211
You know what that means, don't you?

2059
02:39:31,211 --> 02:39:34,271
You know where I'm going to take you?

2060
02:39:34,271 --> 02:39:38,300
You think you're not afraid of me, don't you?

2061
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:44,870
You hate me, with your pretty white face and
your monkey eyes.

2062
02:39:44,870 --> 02:39:47,851
Yes - I'm drunk!

2063
02:39:47,851 --> 02:39:54,330
Tonight we shall all ride together proudly,
perhaps for the last time.

2064
02:39:54,330 --> 02:40:01,010
And you shall come with us, Mary - to the
coast.'

2065
02:40:01,010 --> 02:40:08,891
He turned away from her, shouting to his companions,
and the horse, frightened by his cry, moved

2066
02:40:08,891 --> 02:40:10,140
even faster.

2067
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:17,660
The lights of Jamaica Inn disappeared into
the darkness.

2068
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:19,800
CHAPTER TEN
The Wreck

2069
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:27,840
It was a terrible journey of two hours or
more to the coast, and Mary, hurt and shaken

2070
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:32,760
by her rough treatment, lay in the corner
of the carriage, caring little about what

2071
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:34,230
happened to her.

2072
02:40:34,230 --> 02:40:40,500
A sudden stillness, and the cold air blowing
on her face through the open carriage window,

2073
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:43,420
brought her back to the world.

2074
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:44,900
She was alone.

2075
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:48,551
The men had gone, taking their light with
them.

2076
02:40:48,551 --> 02:40:54,130
The carriage had been stopped in a narrow
valley with high banks on either side, and

2077
02:40:54,130 --> 02:40:57,300
the horse had been taken away.

2078
02:40:57,300 --> 02:41:03,311
The valley appeared to slope down sharply,
the track becoming rough and broken, but Mary

2079
02:41:03,311 --> 02:41:06,640
could see only for a few yards.

2080
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:11,000
She tried the handle of the carriage door,
but it was locked.

2081
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,880
Then she listened.

2082
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:17,950
Carried up towards her on the wind came the
sound of the sea.

2083
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:21,440
The valley clearly led down to the shore.

2084
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:24,000
Mary trembled.

2085
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:31,261
Somewhere in the darkness below, her uncle
and his companions were waiting for the tide.

2086
02:41:31,261 --> 02:41:34,170
Mary considered the size of the window.

2087
02:41:34,170 --> 02:41:40,360
The door was locked, she knew, but she might
force her body through the narrow window frame.

2088
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:46,280
She struggled and pushed, and then finally
she lost her balance and fell to the ground

2089
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:47,280
below.

2090
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:53,251
The drop was nothing, but the fall shook her
and she felt blood run down her side where

2091
02:41:53,251 --> 02:41:56,120
the window had caught her.

2092
02:41:56,120 --> 02:42:00,890
She gave herself a moment to rest, and then
she dragged herself to her feet and began

2093
02:42:00,890 --> 02:42:06,550
to move uncertainly along the track, in the
dark shelter of the bank.

2094
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:11,021
She had not yet formed a plan, but, with her
back turned away from the sea, she would be

2095
02:42:11,021 --> 02:42:14,230
putting distance between herself and the men.

2096
02:42:14,230 --> 02:42:19,801
This track, leading upwards and to the left,
would take her to the high ground above the

2097
02:42:19,801 --> 02:42:21,760
beach.

2098
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:27,530
She felt her way along the path, sometimes
almost falling on loose stones, her hair blowing

2099
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:28,640
into her eyes.

2100
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:34,860
Turning a sharp corner, she put up her hands
to push back the loose curls from her eyes,

2101
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:40,670
and because of this, she did not see a man
kneeling against the bank with his back towards

2102
02:42:40,670 --> 02:42:44,680
her, his eyes watching the track ahead.

2103
02:42:44,680 --> 02:42:50,010
She came against him, knocking the breath
from his body, and he, taken by surprise,

2104
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:53,490
fell with her, crying out in fear and anger.

2105
02:42:53,490 --> 02:43:01,050
They fought on the ground, her hands tearing
at his face, but he was too strong for her.

2106
02:43:01,050 --> 02:43:08,920
He leant on her, breathing heavily, and then
he looked closely at her, showing broken yellow

2107
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:09,920
teeth.

2108
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,510
It was Harry the pedlar.

2109
02:43:12,510 --> 02:43:18,051
He expected her to cry or struggle but when
she did neither, he moved his weight on to

2110
02:43:18,051 --> 02:43:22,370
his arm and smiled at her in an ugly way.

2111
02:43:22,370 --> 02:43:25,830
'Didn't expect to see me, did you?

2112
02:43:25,830 --> 02:43:30,240
Thought I was down on the shore with the landlord
and the rest!

2113
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:36,080
But now you re here, I'll make you very welcome.'

2114
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:38,670
He was smiling still.

2115
02:43:38,670 --> 02:43:44,170
She moved quickly, striking out at him, and
hit him hard on the chin.

2116
02:43:44,170 --> 02:43:50,260
In a second, she had struggled from under
him and pulled herself to her feet.

2117
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:55,670
She searched for a stone to throw at him,
but finding nothing but loose earth and sand,

2118
02:43:55,670 --> 02:44:01,040
she scattered this in his face and eyes, so
that he was blinded for a moment.

2119
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:07,250
Then she turned again, and began to run like
a hunted thing up the twisting track, her

2120
02:44:07,250 --> 02:44:13,010
mouth open, her hands outstretched, falling
over the stones in the path, all sense of

2121
02:44:13,010 --> 02:44:17,510
direction gone, her one idea to escape from
Harry the pedlar.

2122
02:44:17,510 --> 02:44:24,420
A wall of mist closed in on her, blocking
out the distant line of bushes at which she,

2123
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:30,230
had been aiming, and she stopped immediately,
knowing the danger of low cloud, and how it

2124
02:44:30,230 --> 02:44:33,190
might deceive her.

2125
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:38,170
Progress now was slow, but she knew that she
was increasing the distance between herself

2126
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:43,050
and the pedlar, which was the only thing that
mattered.

2127
02:44:43,050 --> 02:44:49,300
She had no idea of the time; it was three,
perhaps four, in the morning, and the darkness

2128
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:53,490
would give no sign of breaking for many hours.

2129
02:44:53,490 --> 02:44:58,141
Once more, the rain came down through the
curtain of mist, and it seemed as if she could

2130
02:44:58,141 --> 02:45:03,510
hear the sea on every side of her and there
was no escape from it.

2131
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:09,290
The breaking waves, though she could not see
them, were somewhere out in the darkness,

2132
02:45:09,290 --> 02:45:14,540
and to her surprise it seemed that they were
on a level with her, not beneath her.

2133
02:45:14,540 --> 02:45:21,340
This meant that the track must have been only
a few yards from the sea itself.

2134
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:25,180
The high banks had cut off the sound of the
waves.

2135
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:31,010
Just as she decided this, there was a break
in the mist ahead of her.

2136
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:39,660
Directly in front of her were the high waves
breaking on the shore.

2137
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:45,050
After a time, when her eyes had become used
to the shadows, she saw, grouped against a

2138
02:45:45,050 --> 02:45:52,780
large rock on the beach, a small number of
men, silently looking ahead into the darkness.

2139
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:56,851
Their stillness made them more threatening.

2140
02:45:56,851 --> 02:45:57,851
She waited.

2141
02:45:57,851 --> 02:46:00,771
They did not move.

2142
02:46:00,771 --> 02:46:06,940
The mist began to lift very slowly, showing
the shape of the coastline.

2143
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:12,810
To the right, in the distance, where the highest
part of the rocks sloped to the sea, Mary

2144
02:46:12,810 --> 02:46:14,950
could just see a light.

2145
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:17,820
At first, she thought it was a star.

2146
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:23,240
But then she realized with a shock that it
was a false light placed there by her uncle

2147
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:24,420
and his companions.

2148
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:30,830
They waited, all of them, standing on the
stones with the waves breaking beyond their

2149
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:32,420
feet.

2150
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:34,480
Mary watched with them.

2151
02:46:34,480 --> 02:46:38,960
Then out of the cloud and darkness came another
light in answer to the first.

2152
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:46,760
And now Mary could see the dark shape of a
ship and the white sea boiling around it.

2153
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:52,070
The ship's fight drew closer to the light
on the rocks, like an insect flying into a

2154
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:54,320
flame.

2155
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:56,380
Mary could bear no more.

2156
02:46:56,380 --> 02:47:02,860
She got to her feet and ran out across the
beach, shouting and crying, waving her hands

2157
02:47:02,860 --> 02:47:08,280
above her head, lifting her voice in her battle
against the sea and the wind, which threw

2158
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:10,710
it back to her.

2159
02:47:10,710 --> 02:47:15,090
Someone caught hold of her and forced her
down on to the beach.

2160
02:47:15,090 --> 02:47:17,540
She was stepped on and kicked.

2161
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:24,490
Her cries died away as a rough cloth covered
her mouth; her arms were pulled behind her

2162
02:47:24,490 --> 02:47:28,150
and tied together, the rope cutting into her
flesh.

2163
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:35,630
They left her then, with the waves sweeping
towards her not 20 yards away, and as she

2164
02:47:35,630 --> 02:47:41,450
lay there helpless, she heard the cry that
had been hers become the cry of others, and

2165
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:43,540
fill the air with sound.

2166
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:50,550
This cry rose above the noise of the sea,
and was seized and carried by the wind; and

2167
02:47:50,550 --> 02:47:57,000
with the cry came the terrible sound of splitting
and breaking wood.

2168
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:03,870
Mary saw the great black shape that had been
the ship roll slowly on its side in two parts.

2169
02:48:03,870 --> 02:48:09,890
From it, little black dots fell one by one
into the white sea.

2170
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:16,710
A terrible sickness came over Mary and she
closed her eyes, her face pressed into the

2171
02:48:16,710 --> 02:48:18,200
stones.

2172
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:23,101
The men who had waited during the cold hours
waited no more.

2173
02:48:23,101 --> 02:48:28,330
They ran crazily backwards and forwards on
the sand, shouting.

2174
02:48:28,330 --> 02:48:34,090
They walked waist-deep in the waves, careless
of danger, seizing the goods carried in on

2175
02:48:34,090 --> 02:48:35,090
the tide.

2176
02:48:35,090 --> 02:48:40,870
They were animals, fighting and pulling things
away from one another.

2177
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:46,010
One of them lit a fire in the corner by the
rocks, the flames burning strongly in spite

2178
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:47,880
of the rain.

2179
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:53,600
The goods from the sea were dragged across
the beach and piled beside it.

2180
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:58,990
The fire spread a yellow light over the scene
and threw long shadows over the sand where

2181
02:48:58,990 --> 02:49:03,910
the men ran backwards and forwards.

2182
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:09,811
When the first body was washed on to the shore,
they ran to it, searching among the remains

2183
02:49:09,811 --> 02:49:14,410
with their hands, picking it as clean as a
bone.

2184
02:49:14,410 --> 02:49:17,160
There was no system in their work tonight.

2185
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:23,811
They robbed here and there, crazy with the
success they had not planned - dogs at the

2186
02:49:23,811 --> 02:49:29,600
heels of their master whose idea had proved
so successful, whose power this was, whose

2187
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,600
greatness.

2188
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:38,170
They followed him where he ran among the breaking
waves, the water streaming from him; he was

2189
02:49:38,170 --> 02:49:41,330
larger and stronger than them all.

2190
02:49:41,330 --> 02:49:48,100
The tide turned, and there was a new coldness
in the air.

2191
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:50,930
The sky and the sea turned grey.

2192
02:49:50,930 --> 02:49:55,460
At first, the men did not notice the change.

2193
02:49:55,460 --> 02:50:02,660
And then Joss Merlyn himself lifted his great
head; he shouted suddenly, calling the men

2194
02:50:02,660 --> 02:50:07,100
to silence, pointing to the sky that was pale
now.

2195
02:50:07,100 --> 02:50:14,000
They paused, looking once more at the things,
which rose and fell in the sea; and then they

2196
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:20,380
all turned and began to run towards the entrance
to the little valley, silent once more, their

2197
02:50:20,380 --> 02:50:23,820
faces grey and frightened in the growing light.

2198
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:27,500
Success had made them careless.

2199
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:36,660
The day had broken; the world was waking up;
night, that had been their friend, covered

2200
02:50:36,660 --> 02:50:40,771
them no more.

2201
02:50:40,771 --> 02:50:47,920
It was Joss Merlyn who tore the cloth away
from her mouth and pulled Mary to her feet.

2202
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:53,570
He threw her over his shoulder and ran across
the beach to the entrance to the valley; and

2203
02:50:53,570 --> 02:50:58,710
his companions, caught up already in fear,
threw some of the goods they had seized from

2204
02:50:58,710 --> 02:51:01,490
the sea on the backs of the horses tied up
there.

2205
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:05,181
Their movements were feverish and fearful.

2206
02:51:05,181 --> 02:51:11,460
The carriage, stuck in the bank halfway up
the valley, could not be pulled out in spite

2207
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:14,021
of all their efforts.

2208
02:51:14,021 --> 02:51:17,780
Some of them ran off, in different directions.

2209
02:51:17,780 --> 02:51:24,420
Here on the coast, where every face was known,
strangers would be noticed; but a wanderer

2210
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:29,990
could make his way alone, finding his own
cover and his own path.

2211
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:35,140
These running men were cursed by those who
remained struggling with the carriage, and

2212
02:51:35,140 --> 02:51:40,370
now, through stupidity and fear, it was pulled
from the bank in so rough a manner that it

2213
02:51:40,370 --> 02:51:46,230
overturned, rolling over on one side and breaking
a wheel.

2214
02:51:46,230 --> 02:51:51,330
There was a wild rush to the remaining farm
wagon that had been left farther up the road,

2215
02:51:51,330 --> 02:51:54,210
and to the already overloaded horses.

2216
02:51:54,210 --> 02:52:00,210
Someone, still obedient to the leader, set
fire to the broken carriage, whose presence

2217
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:03,570
beside the track meant danger to them all.

2218
02:52:03,570 --> 02:52:08,920
A terrible fight broke out between man and
man for possession of the farm wagon that

2219
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:12,760
might yet carry them away to safety.

2220
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:18,580
Those who carried guns now had the advantage,
and the landlord, with his remaining supporter

2221
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:25,840
Harry the pedlar by his side, stood with his
back to the wagon and shot into the crowd.

2222
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:29,260
This won the wagon for the landlord.

2223
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:34,500
The remaining men, frightened at the sight
of the blood and the dying men, turned all

2224
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:40,630
at the same moment and scattered up the twisting
track, anxious now to put a safe distance

2225
02:52:40,630 --> 02:52:44,670
between themselves and their former leader.

2226
02:52:44,670 --> 02:52:50,820
The landlord, leant against the wagon holding
the smoking, murderous gun, blood running

2227
02:52:50,820 --> 02:52:53,510
freely from a cut beside his eye.

2228
02:52:53,510 --> 02:52:58,360
Now that they were alone, he and the pedlar
wasted little time.

2229
02:52:58,360 --> 02:53:03,530
The goods that had been brought up the valley
they threw on the wagon with Mary next to

2230
02:53:03,530 --> 02:53:04,820
them.

2231
02:53:04,820 --> 02:53:08,760
The main store was still down on the sand
and washed by the tide.

2232
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:13,570
They dared not risk collecting it; there was
simply no time.

2233
02:53:13,570 --> 02:53:18,920
The two men who had been shot lay in the road
beside the wagon.

2234
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:24,160
Their bodies bore witness, and must be destroyed.

2235
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:28,841
It was Harry the pedlar who dragged them to
the fire.

2236
02:53:28,841 --> 02:53:33,420
It was burning well; much of the carriage
had disappeared already, though one red wheel

2237
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:38,510
stuck up above the blackened and broken wood.

2238
02:53:38,510 --> 02:53:43,870
Joss Merlyn led the remaining horses to the
wagon, and without a word, the two men climbed

2239
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:47,780
in and whipped them into action.

2240
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:52,360
Lying on her back, Mary watched the low clouds
pass across the sky.

2241
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:58,460
Darkness had gone; the morning was wet and
grey.

2242
02:53:58,460 --> 02:54:03,640
From far away across the fields came the sound
of church bells.

2243
02:54:03,640 --> 02:54:10,261
She remembered suddenly that it was Christmas
Day.

2244
02:54:10,261 --> 02:54:13,710
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Joss Plans to Escape

2245
02:54:13,710 --> 02:54:19,440
The square of glass was familiar to her.

2246
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:24,470
It was larger than the carriage window, and
there was a crack across it that she remembered

2247
02:54:24,470 --> 02:54:25,970
well.

2248
02:54:25,970 --> 02:54:31,660
She kept her eyes on it, struggling with memory,
and she wondered why she no longer felt the

2249
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:36,570
rain on her face and the steady current of
wind.

2250
02:54:36,570 --> 02:54:42,440
Mary cried, and turned her head restlessly
from side to side; out of the corner of her

2251
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:48,890
eye, she saw the brown, discoloured wall beside
her and the old nail- head where a picture

2252
02:54:48,890 --> 02:54:51,360
had once hung.

2253
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:55,730
She was lying in her bedroom at Jamaica Inn.

2254
02:54:55,730 --> 02:55:02,310
Now there was a face bending down to her,
and she drew back, her hands in front of her,

2255
02:55:02,310 --> 02:55:06,230
because the ugly mouth and broken teeth of
the pedlar were still in her mind.

2256
02:55:06,230 --> 02:55:12,741
Her hands were held gently, though, and the
eyes that looked down at her, reddened like

2257
02:55:12,741 --> 02:55:17,761
her own from crying, were watery and blue.

2258
02:55:17,761 --> 02:55:18,990
It was Aunt Patience.

2259
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:24,131
'How long have I been lying here?'

2260
02:55:24,131 --> 02:55:28,980
Mary asked, and she was told that this was
the second day.

2261
02:55:28,980 --> 02:55:33,580
For a moment, she was silent, considering
this information.

2262
02:55:33,580 --> 02:55:39,780
Then she sat up in bed and swung her legs
to the floor, her head aching with the effort.

2263
02:55:39,780 --> 02:55:44,100
'What are you going to do?'

2264
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:50,410
Aunt Patience pulled at her nervously, but
the young woman shook her off and began, slowly

2265
02:55:50,410 --> 02:55:53,340
and painfully, to put on her clothes.

2266
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:59,610
'Aunt Patience, I have gone through enough
out of loyalty to you.

2267
02:55:59,610 --> 02:56:03,811
You can't expect me to stand any more.

2268
02:56:03,811 --> 02:56:09,851
Whatever Uncle Joss may have been to you once,
he isn't human now.

2269
02:56:09,851 --> 02:56:13,771
He's an animal, half-crazy with drink and
blood.

2270
02:56:13,771 --> 02:56:19,940
Men were murdered by him on the coast; don't
you understand?

2271
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:22,771
Men were drowned in the sea.

2272
02:56:22,771 --> 02:56:24,980
I can see nothing else.

2273
02:56:24,980 --> 02:56:29,700
I shall think of nothing else until my dying
day.'

2274
02:56:29,700 --> 02:56:39,100
The door opened; the landlord of Jamaica Inn
stood in the doorway.

2275
02:56:39,100 --> 02:56:45,170
He looked tired and grey; the cut above his
eye was still bright red.

2276
02:56:45,170 --> 02:56:49,790
He was dirty and unwashed, and there were
black shadows under his eyes.

2277
02:56:49,790 --> 02:56:56,060
'I thought I heard voices in the yard, but
I saw no one.

2278
02:56:56,060 --> 02:56:58,120
Did you hear anything?'

2279
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:00,790
Nobody answered.

2280
02:57:00,790 --> 02:57:06,180
He sat down on the bed, his hands picking
at the bedclothes, his eyes wandering from

2281
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:07,990
the window to the door.

2282
02:57:07,990 --> 02:57:09,850
'He'll come.

2283
02:57:09,850 --> 02:57:12,650
He's sure to come.

2284
02:57:12,650 --> 02:57:17,021
I've cut my own throat; I've disobeyed him.

2285
02:57:17,021 --> 02:57:22,681
He warned me once, and I laughed at him; I
didn't listen.

2286
02:57:22,681 --> 02:57:26,040
I wanted to play the game on my own.

2287
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:30,320
It means death for us, for all three of us
sitting here.

2288
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:33,380
We're finished, I tell you.

2289
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:36,090
Why did you let me drink?

2290
02:57:36,090 --> 02:57:41,840
Why didn't you break every bottle in the house,
and turn the key on me?

2291
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:44,021
I'd not have hurt you.

2292
02:57:44,021 --> 02:57:49,710
Now it's too late; the end has come.'

2293
02:57:49,710 --> 02:57:55,630
He looked from one to the other of them, his
reddened eyes hollow; the women looked back

2294
02:57:55,630 --> 02:57:58,971
without understanding.

2295
02:57:58,971 --> 02:58:02,100
'What do you mean?' said Mary at last.

2296
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:04,830
'Who are you afraid of?

2297
02:58:04,830 --> 02:58:07,100
Who warned you?'

2298
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:13,310
He shook his head, and his hands wandered
to his mouth, the fingers restless.

2299
02:58:13,310 --> 02:58:19,030
'No,' he said slowly, 'my secrets are still
my own.

2300
02:58:19,030 --> 02:58:27,561
But I tell you one thing - and you're in it
now as much as Patience there - we have enemies

2301
02:58:27,561 --> 02:58:30,530
on either side of us now.

2302
02:58:30,530 --> 02:58:36,460
We have the law on one hand, and on the other...'

2303
02:58:36,460 --> 02:58:41,830
He stopped himself, the old look beginning
to return to his eyes once more.

2304
02:58:41,830 --> 02:58:46,030
'You'd like to know, wouldn't you?

2305
02:58:46,030 --> 02:58:50,591
You'd like to run out of the house with the
name on your lips.

2306
02:58:50,591 --> 02:58:53,320
You'd like to see me hanged.

2307
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:58,010
All right, I don't blame you for it.

2308
02:58:58,010 --> 02:59:02,320
But I saved you too, didn't I?

2309
02:59:02,320 --> 02:59:08,800
Nobody touched you last night except myself,
and I've not spoilt your pretty face.

2310
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:11,330
Let's get out of here.

2311
02:59:11,330 --> 02:59:17,590
This room smells of decay.

2312
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:19,721
They followed him without a word.

2313
02:59:19,721 --> 02:59:24,910
He led the way to the kitchen, where the door
was locked and the window barred.

2314
02:59:24,910 --> 02:59:28,810
The landlord pulled the wooden shutters closed
too.

2315
02:59:28,810 --> 02:59:31,771
Then he turned and faced the women.

2316
02:59:31,771 --> 02:59:34,811
'We've got to think out a plan.

2317
02:59:34,811 --> 02:59:42,400
We've been sitting here for nearly two days
now, like rats in a trap.

2318
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:44,190
And I've had enough, I tell you.

2319
02:59:44,190 --> 02:59:48,771
I never could play that sort of game.'

2320
02:59:48,771 --> 02:59:56,200
His wife crept over to him and touched him
on the arm, passing her tongue over her lips.

2321
02:59:56,200 --> 03:00:00,280
'Well, what is it?' he said wildly.

2322
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:06,610
'Why can't we creep away now, before it's
too late?

2323
03:00:06,610 --> 03:00:12,240
We'd be in Launceston and then out of the
area in a few hours.

2324
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:14,660
We could travel by night.

2325
03:00:14,660 --> 03:00:20,580
We could head east where we'd be safe.'

2326
03:00:20,580 --> 03:00:23,200
'You fool!' he shouted.

2327
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:30,070
'Don't you realize that there are people on
the road between here and Launceston who think

2328
03:00:30,070 --> 03:00:37,250
I'm the devil himself - who are only waiting
for their chance to charge me with every crime

2329
03:00:37,250 --> 03:00:38,750
in Cornwall?

2330
03:00:38,750 --> 03:00:45,561
Everybody round here knows by now what happened
on the coast on Christmas Eve, and if they

2331
03:00:45,561 --> 03:00:49,950
see us running away they'll have the proof.

2332
03:00:49,950 --> 03:00:55,050
Don't you think I've wanted to get away and
save myself?

2333
03:00:55,050 --> 03:01:01,790
No, we've got one chance - one single chance
in a million.

2334
03:01:01,790 --> 03:01:04,660
We've got to lie quiet.

2335
03:01:04,660 --> 03:01:09,920
If we stay here at Jamaica Inn it may confuse
them.

2336
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:12,830
They've got to look for proof.

2337
03:01:12,830 --> 03:01:18,360
They've got to get sworn proof before they
lay hands on us.

2338
03:01:18,360 --> 03:01:26,920
Oh, yes, the ship's there with her back broken
on the rocks, and piles of things lying on

2339
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:29,510
the sand ready to take away.

2340
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:34,550
They'll find two burnt bodies, and a pile
of ashes.

2341
03:01:34,550 --> 03:01:40,280
Many of us will be suspected, but where's
the proof?

2342
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:42,681
Answer me that.

2343
03:01:42,681 --> 03:01:47,040
I was here that night with my family!'

2344
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:51,530
'You've forgotten one thing, haven't you?'
said Mary.

2345
03:01:51,530 --> 03:01:54,790
'No, my dear, I have not.

2346
03:01:54,790 --> 03:02:03,740
The driver of that carriage was shot not a
quarter of a mile down the road outside.

2347
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:09,001
You were hoping we'd left the body there,
weren't you?

2348
03:02:09,001 --> 03:02:15,710
The body travelled with us to the coast and
it lies now, if I remember rightly, beneath

2349
03:02:15,710 --> 03:02:20,591
a 10- foot bank of sand.

2350
03:02:20,591 --> 03:02:24,670
Of course, someone is going to miss him.

2351
03:02:24,670 --> 03:02:32,061
I'm prepared for that; but as they'll never
find his carriage it does not matter much.

2352
03:02:32,061 --> 03:02:37,110
Perhaps he was tired of his wife and has driven
to Penzance.

2353
03:02:37,110 --> 03:02:40,931
They can look for him there.'

2354
03:02:40,931 --> 03:02:47,130
He threw back his head and laughed; but his
laugh was cut short in the middle, his mouth

2355
03:02:47,130 --> 03:02:52,310
shut like a trap, his face as white as a sheet.

2356
03:02:52,310 --> 03:02:56,690
'Listen,' he whispered, 'listen...'

2357
03:02:56,690 --> 03:03:02,430
They followed the direction of his eyes, which
were fixed on the crack of light that came

2358
03:03:02,430 --> 03:03:04,930
through the shutters.

2359
03:03:04,930 --> 03:03:11,830
Something was knocking gently at the kitchen
window... knocking lightly, softly at the

2360
03:03:11,830 --> 03:03:12,930
glass.

2361
03:03:12,930 --> 03:03:17,940
There was no other sound in the kitchen except
for the frightened breathing of Aunt Patience,

2362
03:03:17,940 --> 03:03:23,280
whose hand crept along the table towards Mary.

2363
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:26,530
The landlord stood completely still for a
moment.

2364
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:32,150
Then he bent forward until his fingers reached
the gun that stood against the chair, never

2365
03:03:32,150 --> 03:03:34,761
once taking his eyes from the shutters.

2366
03:03:34,761 --> 03:03:39,391
He jumped forward, tearing the shutters open.

2367
03:03:39,391 --> 03:03:46,640
A man stood outside the window, his face pressed
against the glass, his broken teeth showing

2368
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:49,440
in a twisted smile.

2369
03:03:49,440 --> 03:03:52,200
It was Harry the pedlar.

2370
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:55,350
Joss Merlyn swore, and threw open the window.

2371
03:03:55,350 --> 03:03:57,230
'Come inside, can't you?

2372
03:03:57,230 --> 03:04:01,850
Do you want to be shot, you fool?

2373
03:04:01,850 --> 03:04:04,890
Unlock the door, Mary.'

2374
03:04:04,890 --> 03:04:07,550
She did so without a word.

2375
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:14,570
'Well, have you brought news?' asked the landlord.

2376
03:04:14,570 --> 03:04:17,431
The pedlar pointed over his shoulder.

2377
03:04:17,431 --> 03:04:23,960
'The country's wild with anger; they're crazy
for blood and justice.

2378
03:04:23,960 --> 03:04:29,980
There'll only be one end to this storm, Joss,
and you know the name for it, don't you?'

2379
03:04:29,980 --> 03:04:32,780
He made a sign with his hands across his throat.

2380
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:36,150
'We've got to run,' he said.

2381
03:04:36,150 --> 03:04:38,400
'It's our only chance.

2382
03:04:38,400 --> 03:04:43,840
The roads are poison, and Bodmin and Launceston
worst of all.

2383
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:49,250
I'll keep to the moors; it'll take me longer,
I know that, but what does that matter if

2384
03:04:49,250 --> 03:04:51,010
you save yourself from hanging?'

2385
03:04:51,010 --> 03:04:55,551
'So you'll give up, Harry, will you?

2386
03:04:55,551 --> 03:04:58,780
Run like a beaten dog?

2387
03:04:58,780 --> 03:05:02,350
Have they proved it was us?

2388
03:05:02,350 --> 03:05:03,430
Tell me that.

2389
03:05:03,430 --> 03:05:07,521
Or are you worried about your soul?'

2390
03:05:07,521 --> 03:05:11,700
'Curse my soul, Joss; it's common sense I'm
thinking of.

2391
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:17,521
This part of the country is dangerous, and
I'll leave while I can.

2392
03:05:17,521 --> 03:05:20,521
I've stayed by you, haven't I?

2393
03:05:20,521 --> 03:05:25,910
I've come out here today, risking death, to
give you warning.

2394
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:32,360
I'm not saying anything against you, Joss,
but it was your stupidity that brought us

2395
03:05:32,360 --> 03:05:33,860
to this, wasn't it?

2396
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:39,521
You made us crazy like yourself, and led us
to the coast on an adventure that none of

2397
03:05:39,521 --> 03:05:41,440
us had planned.

2398
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:45,050
We took a chance in a million - and succeeded.

2399
03:05:45,050 --> 03:05:47,230
Too well.

2400
03:05:47,230 --> 03:05:53,760
We became stupid with excitement, left a hundred
tracks scattered on the sand.

2401
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:55,530
And whose fault was it?

2402
03:05:55,530 --> 03:05:57,080
Why, yours, I say!'

2403
03:05:57,080 --> 03:06:04,891
He banged the table, his yellow face pushed
close to the landlord's.

2404
03:06:04,891 --> 03:06:10,690
Joss Merlyn considered him for a moment, and
when he spoke, his voice was dangerous and

2405
03:06:10,690 --> 03:06:12,440
low.

2406
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:17,710
'So you blame me, do you, Harry?

2407
03:06:17,710 --> 03:06:22,710
You're like the rest of your kind when the
luck of the game turns against you.

2408
03:06:22,710 --> 03:06:29,870
Run, then, if you like; run to the riverbank
like a beaten dog.

2409
03:06:29,870 --> 03:06:33,910
I'll fight the world alone!'

2410
03:06:33,910 --> 03:06:36,440
The pedlar forced a laugh.

2411
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:41,500
'We can talk, can't we, without cutting each
other's throats?

2412
03:06:41,500 --> 03:06:47,110
I've not gone against you; I'm on your side
still.

2413
03:06:47,110 --> 03:06:49,510
We were all crazy that night, I know that.

2414
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:55,140
Let's leave it alone, then; what's done is
done.

2415
03:06:55,140 --> 03:06:59,860
Our men are scattered, and we needn't worry
about them.

2416
03:06:59,860 --> 03:07:03,171
They'll be too frightened to show their heads.

2417
03:07:03,171 --> 03:07:06,410
That leaves you and me, Joss.

2418
03:07:06,410 --> 03:07:13,310
We've been in this business, the pair of us,
deeper than most, and the more we help each

2419
03:07:13,310 --> 03:07:17,221
other, the better it'll be for us both.

2420
03:07:17,221 --> 03:07:25,180
Now then, that's why I'm here, to talk and
see what we ought to do.'

2421
03:07:25,180 --> 03:07:27,110
The landlord watched him calmly.

2422
03:07:27,110 --> 03:07:34,490
'Just what are you aiming at, Harry?' he said,
filling his pipe.

2423
03:07:34,490 --> 03:07:37,900
'I'm not aiming at anything.

2424
03:07:37,900 --> 03:07:42,601
I want to make things easier for all of us.

2425
03:07:42,601 --> 03:07:46,280
We've got to go, unless we want to hang.

2426
03:07:46,280 --> 03:07:53,850
But it's like this, Joss; I don't see the
fun of going empty-handed.

2427
03:07:53,850 --> 03:07:58,000
There are a lot of things we put in the store
room two days ago.

2428
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,771
That's right, isn't it?

2429
03:07:59,771 --> 03:08:04,271
It belongs to all of us who worked for it
on that night.

2430
03:08:04,271 --> 03:08:11,650
But there's none of them left to claim it
except you and me.

2431
03:08:11,650 --> 03:08:17,160
I'm not saying that there's much of value
there, but I don't see why some of it shouldn't

2432
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:22,970
help us out of the area, do you?'

2433
03:08:22,970 --> 03:08:27,790
The landlord blew a cloud of smoke into his
face.

2434
03:08:27,790 --> 03:08:34,670
'So you didn't come back to Jamaica Inn because
of my sweet smile alone, then?

2435
03:08:34,670 --> 03:08:41,670
I was thinking you were fond of me, and wanted
to hold my hand.'

2436
03:08:41,670 --> 03:08:45,490
The pedlar smiled, and changed his position
on his chair.

2437
03:08:45,490 --> 03:08:49,181
'All right - we're friends, aren't we?

2438
03:08:49,181 --> 03:08:52,051
There's no harm in plain speaking.

2439
03:08:52,051 --> 03:08:56,812
The things are here, and it'll take two men
to move it.

2440
03:08:56,812 --> 03:08:59,930
The women can't do it.

2441
03:08:59,930 --> 03:09:04,490
What's against you and me making a deal?'

2442
03:09:04,490 --> 03:09:09,011
The landlord thoughtfully smoked his pipe.

2443
03:09:09,011 --> 03:09:14,290
'And supposing there's nothing here, after
all?

2444
03:09:14,290 --> 03:09:18,280
Supposing I've got rid of it already?

2445
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:25,271
I've been sitting here for two days, you know,
and the coaches pass my door.

2446
03:09:25,271 --> 03:09:29,440
What then, Harry boy?'

2447
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:32,631
The smile went from the face of the pedlar.

2448
03:09:32,631 --> 03:09:33,970
'What's the joke?

2449
03:09:33,970 --> 03:09:39,100
Do you play a double game up here at Jamaica
Inn?

2450
03:09:39,100 --> 03:09:42,140
You'll find it hasn't paid you, if you have.

2451
03:09:42,140 --> 03:09:49,570
You've been clever at this trade, month in,
month out; too clever, some of us thought,

2452
03:09:49,570 --> 03:09:55,480
for the small profit we made out of it - we,
who took most of the risks.

2453
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:59,570
And we didn't ask you how you did it.

2454
03:09:59,570 --> 03:10:07,020
Listen here, Joss Merlyn; do you take your
orders from someone above you?'

2455
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:10,120
The landlord was on him like a flash.

2456
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:15,270
He hit him on the chin, and the man went over
backwards onto his head.

2457
03:10:15,270 --> 03:10:21,300
He rolled over onto his knees, but the landlord
towered above him, his gun pointing at his

2458
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:22,300
throat.

2459
03:10:22,300 --> 03:10:33,471
'Move, and you're a dead man,' he said softly,
as Harry looked up at his attacker, his little

2460
03:10:33,471 --> 03:10:35,190
eyes half closed.

2461
03:10:35,190 --> 03:10:44,970
'Now we can talk, you and I.' He leant once
more against the table, while the pedlar continued

2462
03:10:44,970 --> 03:10:47,050
to kneel on the floor.

2463
03:10:47,050 --> 03:10:55,520
'You didn't come here tonight to warn me;
you came to see what you could get out of

2464
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:56,950
the wreck.

2465
03:10:56,950 --> 03:11:01,390
You didn't expect to find me here, did you?

2466
03:11:01,390 --> 03:11:09,940
You thought it would be Patience here, or
Mary; and you would frighten them easily,

2467
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:17,540
wouldn't you, and reach for my gun where it
hangs on the wall, as you've often seen?

2468
03:11:17,540 --> 03:11:24,600
You little rat, Harry, do you think I didn't
see it in your eyes when I threw back the

2469
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:28,090
shutters and saw your face at the window?

2470
03:11:28,090 --> 03:11:31,730
Do you think I didn't see your surprise?

2471
03:11:31,730 --> 03:11:34,010
Very well, then.

2472
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:38,510
We'll make a deal, as you suggest.

2473
03:11:38,510 --> 03:11:46,520
I've changed my mind, my loving friend, and
with your help we'll take the road.

2474
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:52,340
There are things in this place worth taking,
and I can't load them alone.

2475
03:11:52,340 --> 03:11:58,490
Tomorrow is Sunday, and a day of rest.

2476
03:11:58,490 --> 03:12:06,180
Not even the wrecking of 50 ships will drag
the people around here from their knees.

2477
03:12:06,180 --> 03:12:12,540
There'll be prayers offered for poor sailors
who suffer because of the devil's work, but

2478
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:18,630
they'll not go looking for the devil on a
Sunday.

2479
03:12:18,630 --> 03:12:25,970
'Twenty-four hours we have, Harry my boy,
and tomorrow night when you've broken your

2480
03:12:25,970 --> 03:12:36,110
back loading my property into the farm wagon
and kissed me goodbye - why, then you can

2481
03:12:36,110 --> 03:12:43,590
go down on your knees and thank Joss Merlyn
for letting you go free with your life.'

2482
03:12:43,590 --> 03:12:50,350
He raised his gun again, bringing it close
to the man's throat.

2483
03:12:50,350 --> 03:12:54,020
The pedlar cried out, showing the whites of
his eyes.

2484
03:12:54,020 --> 03:12:56,660
The landlord laughed.

2485
03:12:56,660 --> 03:13:05,600
'Come on,' he said, 'do you think I'm going
to play with you all night?

2486
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:11,021
Open the kitchen door, and turn to the right,
and walk down the passage until I tell you

2487
03:13:11,021 --> 03:13:12,970
to stop.

2488
03:13:12,970 --> 03:13:18,850
Your hands have been waiting to explore the
goods brought from the shore, haven't they,

2489
03:13:18,850 --> 03:13:19,850
Harry?

2490
03:13:19,850 --> 03:13:24,190
You shall spend the night in the store room
among them all.'

2491
03:13:24,190 --> 03:13:31,681
Pressing his gun into the pedlar's back, he
pushed him out of the kitchen and down the

2492
03:13:31,681 --> 03:13:33,870
dark passage to the store.

2493
03:13:33,870 --> 03:13:39,600
The door had been mended with new wood and
was stronger than before.

2494
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:46,681
After he had turned the key on his friend,
the landlord returned to the kitchen.

2495
03:13:46,681 --> 03:13:54,190
'I thought Harry would turn soon,' he said.

2496
03:13:54,190 --> 03:13:58,810
'I've seen it coming in his eyes for weeks.

2497
03:13:58,810 --> 03:14:04,380
He'll fight on the winning side, but he'll
turn against you when your luck changes.

2498
03:14:04,380 --> 03:14:07,030
He's jealous of me.

2499
03:14:07,030 --> 03:14:10,340
They're all jealous of me.

2500
03:14:10,340 --> 03:14:15,890
They knew I had brains, and they hated me
for it.

2501
03:14:15,890 --> 03:14:18,590
You'd better get your supper and go to bed.

2502
03:14:18,590 --> 03:14:28,450
You've a long journey to make tomorrow night,
and I warn you here and now it won't be an

2503
03:14:28,450 --> 03:14:31,370
easy one.'

2504
03:14:31,370 --> 03:14:33,100
Mary looked at him across the table.

2505
03:14:33,100 --> 03:14:39,760
Tired as she was, because all that she had
seen and done weighed heavily on her, her

2506
03:14:39,760 --> 03:14:42,400
mind was full of plans.

2507
03:14:42,400 --> 03:14:48,660
Some time, somehow, before tomorrow night,
she must go to Altarnun.

2508
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:51,750
Once there, her responsibility was over.

2509
03:14:51,750 --> 03:14:55,051
Action would be taken by others.

2510
03:14:55,051 --> 03:15:01,270
It would be hard for Aunt Patience, hard for
herself at first, perhaps, but at least justice

2511
03:15:01,270 --> 03:15:02,740
would win.

2512
03:15:02,740 --> 03:15:07,210
It would be easy enough to clear her own name,
and her aunt's.

2513
03:15:07,210 --> 03:15:13,330
The thought of her uncle standing as he would
with his hands tied behind him, powerless

2514
03:15:13,330 --> 03:15:19,561
for the first time and forever, was something
that gave her great pleasure.

2515
03:15:19,561 --> 03:15:21,930
She dragged her eyes away from him.

2516
03:15:21,930 --> 03:15:26,250
'I'll have no supper tonight,' she said.

2517
03:15:26,250 --> 03:15:32,270
He crossed into the hall as she climbed the
stairs, and he followed her to the room over

2518
03:15:32,270 --> 03:15:33,480
the front door.

2519
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:41,570
'Give me your key,' he said, and she handed
it to him without a word.

2520
03:15:41,570 --> 03:15:46,970
He stayed for a moment, looking down at her,
and then he bent low and laid his fingers

2521
03:15:46,970 --> 03:15:48,280
on her mouth.

2522
03:15:48,280 --> 03:15:52,140
'I like you, Mary.

2523
03:15:52,140 --> 03:15:59,150
You've got spirit still, and courage, in spite
of all the rough treatment I've given you.

2524
03:15:59,150 --> 03:16:02,590
I've seen it in your eyes tonight.

2525
03:16:02,590 --> 03:16:11,830
If I'd been a younger man I'd have fallen
in love with you - and won you too, and ridden

2526
03:16:11,830 --> 03:16:12,830
away with you.

2527
03:16:12,830 --> 03:16:16,550
You know that, don't you?'

2528
03:16:16,550 --> 03:16:20,150
He lowered his voice to a whisper.

2529
03:16:20,150 --> 03:16:24,200
'There's danger for me ahead.

2530
03:16:24,200 --> 03:16:26,240
Never mind the law.

2531
03:16:26,240 --> 03:16:31,140
The whole of Cornwall can come running at
my heels and I shall not care.

2532
03:16:31,140 --> 03:16:40,760
It's other things I have to watch for - footsteps,
Mary, that come in the night and go again,

2533
03:16:40,760 --> 03:16:44,180
and a hand that is waiting to strike me down.

2534
03:16:44,180 --> 03:16:53,090
We'll put the river between us and Jamaica
Inn,' he said; and then he smiled, the curve

2535
03:16:53,090 --> 03:16:59,170
of his mouth painfully familiar to her like
something from her past.

2536
03:16:59,170 --> 03:17:03,431
He shut the door on her, and turned the key.

2537
03:17:03,431 --> 03:17:07,210
She went then to her bed, and sat on it.

2538
03:17:07,210 --> 03:17:15,350
And she began to cry, softly and secretly,
the tears tasting bitter as they fell on her

2539
03:17:15,350 --> 03:17:18,250
hand.

2540
03:17:18,250 --> 03:17:23,160
CHAPTER TWELVE
To Altarnun

2541
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:29,000
She had fallen asleep where she lay, without
undressing, and her first conscious thought

2542
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:32,200
was that the storm had returned.

2543
03:17:32,200 --> 03:17:38,100
She was awake immediately, and she waited
for the sound that had woken her to come again.

2544
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:43,780
It came in a moment, a handful of earth thrown
against the window from the yard outside.

2545
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:48,750
It was Jem Merlyn standing below in the yard.

2546
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:55,771
He whispered up to her, 'Come down to the
door here, and open it for me.'

2547
03:17:55,771 --> 03:17:56,870
She shook her head.

2548
03:17:56,870 --> 03:18:00,450
'I can't - I'm locked in my room.'

2549
03:18:00,450 --> 03:18:07,650
He looked back at her, confused, and examined
the house as if it might offer some solution

2550
03:18:07,650 --> 03:18:09,521
of its own.

2551
03:18:09,521 --> 03:18:14,390
He ran his hand along the wall, feeling for
old nails that might once have been used for

2552
03:18:14,390 --> 03:18:19,120
training climbing plants, and would now give
him a foothold of a sort.

2553
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:24,820
Swinging himself up to the low roof over the
front door, he was able to pull himself up

2554
03:18:24,820 --> 03:18:26,990
to the level of her window.

2555
03:18:26,990 --> 03:18:31,970
'I shall have to talk to you here,' he said.

2556
03:18:31,970 --> 03:18:35,140
'Come closer where I can see you.'

2557
03:18:35,140 --> 03:18:40,190
She knelt on the floor of her room, her face
at the window, and they looked at each other

2558
03:18:40,190 --> 03:18:42,660
without speaking.

2559
03:18:42,660 --> 03:18:47,710
He looked tired, and his eyes were hollow
like those of one who has not slept.

2560
03:18:47,710 --> 03:18:54,190
There were lines around his mouth that she
had not noticed before, and he did not smile.

2561
03:18:54,190 --> 03:18:57,590
'I'm sorry,' he said at last.

2562
03:18:57,590 --> 03:19:02,250
'I left you alone without excuse at Launceston
on Christmas Eve.

2563
03:19:02,250 --> 03:19:04,720
You can forgive me or not.

2564
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:10,210
But the reason for it - that I can't give
you.

2565
03:19:10,210 --> 03:19:11,760
I'm sorry.'

2566
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:14,240
She was hurt by his manner.

2567
03:19:14,240 --> 03:19:18,860
His coldness upset her, and she hoped that
he could not see the disappointment in her

2568
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:20,620
face.

2569
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:23,540
He did not even ask how she had returned that
night.

2570
03:19:23,540 --> 03:19:28,200
'Why are you locked in your room?'

2571
03:19:28,200 --> 03:19:30,830
Her voice was flat and dull when she replied.

2572
03:19:30,830 --> 03:19:36,780
'My uncle fears that I may wander in the passage
and discover his secrets.'

2573
03:19:36,780 --> 03:19:40,360
'Where is he?'

2574
03:19:40,360 --> 03:19:42,760
'He's going to spend the night in the kitchen.

2575
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:50,070
He's afraid of something, or someone; the
windows and doors are barred, and he has his

2576
03:19:50,070 --> 03:19:51,950
gun.'

2577
03:19:51,950 --> 03:19:53,310
Jem laughed bitterly.

2578
03:19:53,310 --> 03:19:56,650
'I don't doubt he's afraid.

2579
03:19:56,650 --> 03:20:00,900
He'll be even more frightened before many
hours have passed, I can tell you that.

2580
03:20:00,900 --> 03:20:07,640
I came here to see him, but if he is sitting
there with a gun across his knee I shall come

2581
03:20:07,640 --> 03:20:12,380
again tomorrow, when the shadows have gone.'

2582
03:20:12,380 --> 03:20:13,761
'Tomorrow may be too late.'

2583
03:20:13,761 --> 03:20:16,061
'What do you mean?'

2584
03:20:16,061 --> 03:20:19,290
'He intends to leave Jamaica Inn tonight.'

2585
03:20:19,290 --> 03:20:22,771
'Are you telling me the truth?'

2586
03:20:22,771 --> 03:20:28,250
'Why should I lie to you now?'

2587
03:20:28,250 --> 03:20:29,350
Jem was silent.

2588
03:20:29,350 --> 03:20:33,760
The news had clearly come as a surprise to
him.

2589
03:20:33,760 --> 03:20:38,110
She was thrown back now on her old suspicion
of him.

2590
03:20:38,110 --> 03:20:44,600
He was the visitor expected by her uncle,
and therefore hated by him and feared.

2591
03:20:44,600 --> 03:20:51,051
The face of the pedlar returned to her, and
his words, that had stung Joss Merlyn to anger:

2592
03:20:51,051 --> 03:20:58,410
'Listen here, Joss Merlyn, do you take your
orders from someone above you?'

2593
03:20:58,410 --> 03:21:06,040
The man whose brains made use of the landlord's
strength, the man who had hidden in the empty

2594
03:21:06,040 --> 03:21:07,040
room...

2595
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:14,040
Leaning forward suddenly, he looked into her
face and touched the long cut that ran from

2596
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:16,610
her forehead to her chin.

2597
03:21:16,610 --> 03:21:22,390
'Who did these?' he said, turning now to the
mark on her cheek.

2598
03:21:22,390 --> 03:21:26,590
She paused a moment, and then answered him.

2599
03:21:26,590 --> 03:21:28,960
'I got them on Christmas Eve.'

2600
03:21:28,960 --> 03:21:35,461
The look in his eye told her that he understood,
and had knowledge of the evening, and because

2601
03:21:35,461 --> 03:21:38,330
of it was here now at Jamaica Inn.

2602
03:21:38,330 --> 03:21:42,540
'You were with them, on the shore?' he whispered.

2603
03:21:42,540 --> 03:21:45,830
'Why did you go with them?'

2604
03:21:45,830 --> 03:21:48,850
'They were crazy with drink.

2605
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:50,610
I don't think they knew what they were doing.

2606
03:21:50,610 --> 03:21:53,860
I could no more have stood against them than
a child.

2607
03:21:53,860 --> 03:21:59,010
There were ten of them or more, and my uncle...
he led them.

2608
03:21:59,010 --> 03:22:02,110
He and the pedlar.

2609
03:22:02,110 --> 03:22:05,800
If you know about it, why do you ask me?

2610
03:22:05,800 --> 03:22:08,020
Don't make me remember.

2611
03:22:08,020 --> 03:22:10,700
I don't want to remember.'

2612
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:13,800
'How much did they hurt you?'

2613
03:22:13,800 --> 03:22:16,490
'You can see for yourself.

2614
03:22:16,490 --> 03:22:20,520
I tried to escape and I hurt my side.

2615
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:23,060
They caught me again, of course.

2616
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:28,970
They tied my hands and feet, and tied a cloth
over my mouth so that I could not cry out.

2617
03:22:28,970 --> 03:22:35,440
I saw the ship come through the darkness,
and I could do nothing - alone there in the

2618
03:22:35,440 --> 03:22:36,650
wind and the rain.

2619
03:22:36,650 --> 03:22:40,470
I had to watch them die.'

2620
03:22:40,470 --> 03:22:46,210
She stopped, her voice trembling, her face
in her hands.

2621
03:22:46,210 --> 03:22:52,880
He made no move towards her; and she felt
him far from her, wrapped in secrecy.

2622
03:22:52,880 --> 03:22:55,420
She felt lonelier than ever.

2623
03:22:55,420 --> 03:23:04,960
'Was it my brother who hurt you most?' he
said after a while.

2624
03:23:04,960 --> 03:23:08,350
It was too late; it did not matter now.

2625
03:23:08,350 --> 03:23:11,610
'I've told you he was very drunk.

2626
03:23:11,610 --> 03:23:15,271
You know, better than I perhaps, what he can
do 'then.'

2627
03:23:15,271 --> 03:23:19,140
'Yes, I know.'

2628
03:23:19,140 --> 03:23:23,230
He paused for a moment, and then he took her
hand.

2629
03:23:23,230 --> 03:23:25,351
'He shall die for this.'

2630
03:23:25,351 --> 03:23:29,550
'His death will not bring back the men he
has killed.'

2631
03:23:29,550 --> 03:23:32,260
'I'm not thinking of them now.'

2632
03:23:32,260 --> 03:23:37,030
'If you're thinking of me, don't waste your
sympathy.

2633
03:23:37,030 --> 03:23:39,811
I can deal with it in my own way.

2634
03:23:39,811 --> 03:23:44,440
I've learnt one thing - to depend on myself.'

2635
03:23:44,440 --> 03:23:47,680
'What do you intend to do?'

2636
03:23:47,680 --> 03:23:52,630
'He expects me to go with him, and Aunt Patience
as well.

2637
03:23:52,630 --> 03:23:57,721
If I asked you to do something, how would
you answer me?'

2638
03:23:57,721 --> 03:24:04,220
He smiled then, for the first time, as he
had done in Launceston, and her heart warmed,

2639
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:06,650
encouraged at the change.

2640
03:24:06,650 --> 03:24:10,180
'How can I tell?' he said.

2641
03:24:10,180 --> 03:24:13,521
'I want you to go away from here.'

2642
03:24:13,521 --> 03:24:15,890
'I'm going now.'

2643
03:24:15,890 --> 03:24:21,700
'No, I mean away from the moors - away from
Jamaica Inn.

2644
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:25,220
I want you to tell me you won't return here.

2645
03:24:25,220 --> 03:24:30,230
I can stand up against your brother; I'm in
no danger from him now.

2646
03:24:30,230 --> 03:24:32,700
I don't want you to come here tomorrow.

2647
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:34,890
Please promise me you'll go away.'

2648
03:24:34,890 --> 03:24:38,551
'What have you got in mind?'

2649
03:24:38,551 --> 03:24:42,750
'Something which does not concern you, but
might bring you into danger.

2650
03:24:42,750 --> 03:24:45,030
I can't say any more.

2651
03:24:45,030 --> 03:24:47,260
I would rather you trusted me.'

2652
03:24:47,260 --> 03:24:49,120
'Trust you?

2653
03:24:49,120 --> 03:24:51,060
Of course, I trust you.

2654
03:24:51,060 --> 03:24:54,971
It's you who won't trust me, you little fool.'

2655
03:24:54,971 --> 03:25:01,610
He laughed silently, and bent down to her,
putting his arms round her, and kissed her

2656
03:25:01,610 --> 03:25:06,330
then as he had kissed her in Launceston, but
with anger.

2657
03:25:06,330 --> 03:25:10,650
'Play your own game by yourself, then, and
leave me to play mine.

2658
03:25:10,650 --> 03:25:17,790
If you must be a boy, I can't stop you, but
keep that face, which I have kissed and shall

2659
03:25:17,790 --> 03:25:20,561
kiss again, away from danger.

2660
03:25:20,561 --> 03:25:23,530
You don't want to kill yourself, do you?

2661
03:25:23,530 --> 03:25:29,320
I have to leave you now; it will be light
in less than an hour.

2662
03:25:29,320 --> 03:25:31,380
And if both our plans go wrong, what then?

2663
03:25:31,380 --> 03:25:34,590
Would you mind if you never saw me again?

2664
03:25:34,590 --> 03:25:38,720
No, of course you wouldn't care.

2665
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:46,660
You'll marry a farmer one day, or a small
tradesman, and live quietly among your neighbours.

2666
03:25:46,660 --> 03:25:51,400
Don't tell them you once lived at Jamaica
Inn, or had a horse thief make love to you.

2667
03:25:51,400 --> 03:25:54,180
They'd shut their doors against you.

2668
03:25:54,180 --> 03:25:58,510
Goodbye - and good luck to you.'

2669
03:25:58,510 --> 03:26:01,210
He lowered himself to the ground.

2670
03:26:01,210 --> 03:26:06,530
She watched him from the window, waving to
him, but he had turned and gone without looking

2671
03:26:06,530 --> 03:26:11,360
back at her, crossing the yard like a shadow.

2672
03:26:11,360 --> 03:26:16,360
Morning would soon be here; she would not
sleep again.

2673
03:26:16,360 --> 03:26:21,800
She sat on her bed, waiting for her door to
be unlocked; and she made her plans for the

2674
03:26:21,800 --> 03:26:24,060
evening to come.

2675
03:26:24,060 --> 03:26:28,190
She must act as if she were prepared to make
the planned journey with the landlord and

2676
03:26:28,190 --> 03:26:29,190
Aunt Patience.

2677
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:36,011
Later, she would make some excuse - a desire
to rest in her room before the journey, perhaps

2678
03:26:36,011 --> 03:26:41,230
- and then would come the most dangerous moment
of her day.

2679
03:26:41,230 --> 03:26:47,070
She would have to leave Jamaica Inn secretly
and run to Altarnun.

2680
03:26:47,070 --> 03:26:52,930
Francis Davey would understand; time would
be against them, and he would have to act

2681
03:26:52,930 --> 03:26:54,850
quickly.

2682
03:26:54,850 --> 03:27:00,610
She would then return to the inn, and hope
that her absence had remained unnoticed.

2683
03:27:00,610 --> 03:27:02,480
That was the risk.

2684
03:27:02,480 --> 03:27:09,770
If the landlord went to her room and found
her gone, her life would be worth nothing.

2685
03:27:09,770 --> 03:27:11,841
She must be prepared for that.

2686
03:27:11,841 --> 03:27:14,670
No excuse would save her then.

2687
03:27:14,670 --> 03:27:20,780
But if he believed her to be sleeping, the
game would continue.

2688
03:27:20,780 --> 03:27:26,051
They would make preparations for the journey;
they might even climb into the wagon and come

2689
03:27:26,051 --> 03:27:28,030
out on the road.

2690
03:27:28,030 --> 03:27:31,190
After that, her responsibility would end.

2691
03:27:31,190 --> 03:27:37,021
Whatever happened next would be in the hands
of the Vicar of Altarnun.

2692
03:27:37,021 --> 03:27:49,680
Beyond this she could not think, nor had she
any great desire to look ahead.

2693
03:27:49,680 --> 03:27:53,771
When she had helped them clear the midday
meal away and had persuaded her aunt to pack

2694
03:27:53,771 --> 03:27:59,440
a basket of food for the journey, she turned
to her uncle and spoke to him.

2695
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:05,380
'If we are to travel tonight, would it not
be better if Aunt Patience and I rested now

2696
03:28:05,380 --> 03:28:09,690
during the afternoon, so we could start out
fresh on the journey?

2697
03:28:09,690 --> 03:28:14,410
There will be no sleep for any of us tonight.'

2698
03:28:14,410 --> 03:28:16,230
'You may rest if you like.

2699
03:28:16,230 --> 03:28:19,000
There'll be work for both of you later.

2700
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:23,930
You're right when you say there will be no
sleep for you tonight.

2701
03:28:23,930 --> 03:28:30,350
Go, then; I shall be glad to get rid of you
for a time.'

2702
03:28:30,350 --> 03:28:35,220
Mary entered her own little room and closed
the door, turning the key.

2703
03:28:35,220 --> 03:28:38,750
Her heart beat fast at the thought of adventure.

2704
03:28:38,750 --> 03:28:45,980
It was nearly 4 miles to Altarnun by road,
but she could walk the distance in an hour.

2705
03:28:45,980 --> 03:28:51,530
If she left Jamaica Inn at four o'clock, when
the light was failing, she would be back again

2706
03:28:51,530 --> 03:28:58,470
soon after six; and the landlord would be
unlikely to come to wake her up before seven.

2707
03:28:58,470 --> 03:29:03,540
She had three hours, then, in which to play
her part.

2708
03:29:03,540 --> 03:29:08,420
She would climb out of the window and drop
to the ground, as Jem had done.

2709
03:29:08,420 --> 03:29:14,021
She sat by the window, looking out on the
empty yard and the high road where no one

2710
03:29:14,021 --> 03:29:20,810
ever passed, waiting for the clock in the
hall to strike four.

2711
03:29:20,810 --> 03:29:24,640
When it struck at last, the sound rang out
in the silence.

2712
03:29:24,640 --> 03:29:31,150
Every second was important to her now, and
she must waste no time in going.

2713
03:29:31,150 --> 03:29:33,030
She climbed through the window.

2714
03:29:33,030 --> 03:29:36,460
The jump was nothing, as she had thought.

2715
03:29:36,460 --> 03:29:38,160
She looked up at Jamaica Inn.

2716
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:45,690
It looked evil in the half-darkness, the windows
barred; she thought of the terrible things

2717
03:29:45,690 --> 03:29:52,440
the house had witnessed, the secrets now shut
up behind its walls; and she turned away from

2718
03:29:52,440 --> 03:29:58,471
it as from a house of the dead, and went out
on the road.

2719
03:29:58,471 --> 03:30:00,811
Darkness fell as she walked.

2720
03:30:00,811 --> 03:30:06,311
She came at last to where the roads divided,
and she turned to her left, down the steep

2721
03:30:06,311 --> 03:30:08,480
hill to Altarnun.

2722
03:30:08,480 --> 03:30:11,190
The vicar's house was silent.

2723
03:30:11,190 --> 03:30:14,490
There were no lights there.

2724
03:30:14,490 --> 03:30:17,380
She turned back towards the church.

2725
03:30:17,380 --> 03:30:20,370
Francis Davey would be there, of course!

2726
03:30:20,370 --> 03:30:22,851
It was Sunday.

2727
03:30:22,851 --> 03:30:26,070
She stopped for a moment, uncertain what to
do.

2728
03:30:26,070 --> 03:30:32,710
Then the gate opened and a woman came out
into the road, carrying flowers.

2729
03:30:32,710 --> 03:30:38,061
She looked hard at Mary, knowing her to be
a stranger, and would have passed her by with

2730
03:30:38,061 --> 03:30:41,101
a 'good night', but Mary turned.

2731
03:30:41,101 --> 03:30:43,750
'Forgive me,' she said.

2732
03:30:43,750 --> 03:30:47,230
'I see you have come from the church.

2733
03:30:47,230 --> 03:30:50,360
Can you tell me if Mr Davey is there?'

2734
03:30:50,360 --> 03:30:59,730
'No, he is not,' said the woman; and then,
after a moment, 'Did you want to see him?'

2735
03:30:59,730 --> 03:31:04,771
'Very urgently,' said Mary 'Can you help me?'

2736
03:31:04,771 --> 03:31:10,760
The woman looked at her strangely, and then
she shook her head firmly

2737
03:31:10,760 --> 03:31:13,580
'I'm sorry,' she said.

2738
03:31:13,580 --> 03:31:20,150
'The vicar's away He went to hold a service
in another village, many miles from here.

2739
03:31:20,150 --> 03:31:26,021
He is not expected back in Altarnun tonight.'

2740
03:31:26,021 --> 03:31:32,230
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Murder at Jamaica Inn

2741
03:31:32,230 --> 03:31:35,140
At first, Mary looked at the woman in disbelief.

2742
03:31:35,140 --> 03:31:36,851
'But that's impossible.

2743
03:31:36,851 --> 03:31:38,561
Surely you're mistaken?'

2744
03:31:38,561 --> 03:31:40,840
'The vicar has left.

2745
03:31:40,840 --> 03:31:43,690
He rode away after dinner.

2746
03:31:43,690 --> 03:31:49,390
I ought to know: I am his housekeeper.'

2747
03:31:49,390 --> 03:31:53,400
Mary wondered hopelessly what she could do
now.

2748
03:31:53,400 --> 03:31:59,771
To come to Altarnun and then return without
help to Jamaica Inn was impossible.

2749
03:31:59,771 --> 03:32:05,931
She could not place confidence in the village
people, nor would they believe her story.

2750
03:32:05,931 --> 03:32:11,950
She must find someone with power - someone
who knew something of Joss Merlyn and Jamaica

2751
03:32:11,950 --> 03:32:12,950
Inn.

2752
03:32:12,950 --> 03:32:16,880
'Who is the nearest magistrate?'

2753
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:18,570
she said at last.

2754
03:32:18,570 --> 03:32:21,330
The woman considered the question.

2755
03:32:21,330 --> 03:32:28,900
'Well, the nearest would be Mr Bassat over
at North Hill, and that must be over 4 miles

2756
03:32:28,900 --> 03:32:32,370
from here - perhaps more, perhaps less.

2757
03:32:32,370 --> 03:32:36,271
I can't say for certain, for I've never been
there.

2758
03:32:36,271 --> 03:32:40,400
You surely don't intend to walk out there
tonight?'

2759
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:42,360
'I must.

2760
03:32:42,360 --> 03:32:44,000
There is nothing else for me to do.

2761
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:46,650
I must waste no time, either.

2762
03:32:46,650 --> 03:32:52,970
I'm in great trouble now, and only your vicar
or a magistrate can help me.'

2763
03:32:52,970 --> 03:32:57,890
'You'd better stay here and wait for the vicar,
if you can.'

2764
03:32:57,890 --> 03:33:04,931
'That's impossible,' said Mary, 'but when
he does return, could you tell him perhaps

2765
03:33:04,931 --> 03:33:05,931
that...

2766
03:33:05,931 --> 03:33:11,240
But wait; if you have pen and paper, I'll
write him a note of explanation.

2767
03:33:11,240 --> 03:33:13,170
That would be better still.'

2768
03:33:13,170 --> 03:33:17,680
'Come into my house here, and you may write
what you like.

2769
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:22,020
I can take the note to his house.'

2770
03:33:22,020 --> 03:33:24,890
Mary followed the woman to her house.

2771
03:33:24,890 --> 03:33:27,700
Time was slipping away fast.

2772
03:33:27,700 --> 03:33:32,760
Her uncle would take warning from the fact
that she had run away, and leave the inn before

2773
03:33:32,760 --> 03:33:34,820
the intended time.

2774
03:33:34,820 --> 03:33:39,280
And then her effort would have been for nothing.

2775
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:42,370
Mary wrote with the speed of hopelessness.

2776
03:33:42,370 --> 03:33:47,310
Then she folded the note and gave it to the
woman by her side.

2777
03:33:47,310 --> 03:33:51,980
So she set out on a walk of 4 miles or more
to North Hill.

2778
03:33:51,980 --> 03:33:59,650
She had placed such trust in Francis Davey
that it was hard to realize that he had failed

2779
03:33:59,650 --> 03:34:00,650
her.

2780
03:34:00,650 --> 03:34:04,170
He had not known, of course, that she needed
him.

2781
03:34:04,170 --> 03:34:08,680
She was anxious about Aunt Patience, and the
thought of her setting out on the journey

2782
03:34:08,680 --> 03:34:15,750
like a trembling dog tied to its master made
Mary run along the empty road.

2783
03:34:15,750 --> 03:34:20,540
She came at last to big gates and the entrance
to a driveway.

2784
03:34:20,540 --> 03:34:27,090
This must be North Hill, and this house must
belong to the magistrate.

2785
03:34:27,090 --> 03:34:31,190
In the distance, a church clock struck seven.

2786
03:34:31,190 --> 03:34:35,860
She had been away from Jamaica Inn for about
three hours already.

2787
03:34:35,860 --> 03:34:39,771
Her fear returned as she came to the house.

2788
03:34:39,771 --> 03:34:43,670
She swung the great bell and waited.

2789
03:34:43,670 --> 03:34:49,490
After some time she heard footsteps inside,
and the door was opened by a servant.

2790
03:34:49,490 --> 03:34:56,280
'I have come to see Mr Bassat on very urgent
business,' she told him.

2791
03:34:56,280 --> 03:35:01,791
'The matter is of the greatest importance,
or I would not come at such an hour, and on

2792
03:35:01,791 --> 03:35:03,830
a Sunday night.'

2793
03:35:03,830 --> 03:35:09,420
'Mr Bassat left for Launceston this morning,'
answered the man.

2794
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:13,700
'He was called away at short notice, and he
has not yet returned.'

2795
03:35:13,700 --> 03:35:20,610
This time Mary could not control herself,
and a cry of hopelessness escaped her.

2796
03:35:20,610 --> 03:35:28,221
'I have come a long way,' she said, with great
feeling, as if by the strength of her need

2797
03:35:28,221 --> 03:35:31,551
for him she could bring the magistrate to
her side.

2798
03:35:31,551 --> 03:35:38,240
'If I do not see him, something terrible will
happen, and a great criminal will escape the

2799
03:35:38,240 --> 03:35:40,330
hands of the law.

2800
03:35:40,330 --> 03:35:44,880
You are looking at me strangely, but I am
speaking the truth.

2801
03:35:44,880 --> 03:35:47,980
If only there were someone I could turn to...'

2802
03:35:47,980 --> 03:35:53,630
'Mrs Bassat is at home,' said the man with
interest.

2803
03:35:53,630 --> 03:35:58,800
'Perhaps she will see you, if your business
is as urgent as you say.

2804
03:35:58,800 --> 03:36:03,000
Follow me, will you, to the library?'

2805
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:08,570
Mary crossed the hall in a dream, knowing
only that her plan had failed again, through

2806
03:36:08,570 --> 03:36:13,460
chance alone, and that she was now powerless
to help herself.

2807
03:36:13,460 --> 03:36:19,300
The library, with its bright fire, seemed
unreal to her, and her eyes were not used

2808
03:36:19,300 --> 03:36:20,970
to the light that met them.

2809
03:36:20,970 --> 03:36:28,120
A woman, whom she recognized immediately as
the lady who had bought the horse in Launceston

2810
03:36:28,120 --> 03:36:33,170
market square, was sitting in a chair in front
of the fire.

2811
03:36:33,170 --> 03:36:37,340
She looked up in surprise when Mary was shown
into the room.

2812
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:40,510
Mrs Bassat rose to her feet.

2813
03:36:40,510 --> 03:36:43,750
'What can I do for you?'

2814
03:36:43,750 --> 03:36:45,020
she said kindly.

2815
03:36:45,020 --> 03:36:48,600
'You look pale and tired.

2816
03:36:48,600 --> 03:36:51,450
Won't you sit down?'

2817
03:36:51,450 --> 03:36:52,910
Mary shook her head impatiently.

2818
03:36:52,910 --> 03:36:58,730
'Thank you, but I must know when Mr Bassat
is returning home.'

2819
03:36:58,730 --> 03:37:02,710
'I have no idea,' replied his wife.

2820
03:37:02,710 --> 03:37:10,021
'He had to leave this morning at a moment's
notice, and, to tell you the truth, I am really

2821
03:37:10,021 --> 03:37:11,650
anxious about him.

2822
03:37:11,650 --> 03:37:18,760
If this innkeeper decides to fight, as he
is certain to do, Mr Bassat may be wounded,

2823
03:37:18,760 --> 03:37:20,891
in spite of the soldiers.'

2824
03:37:20,891 --> 03:37:24,700
'What do you mean?' said Mary quickly.

2825
03:37:24,700 --> 03:37:29,320
'He has set out on a highly dangerous piece
of work.

2826
03:37:29,320 --> 03:37:36,760
Your face is new to me, and I suppose you
are not from North Hill, or you would have

2827
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:42,240
heard of the man Merlyn who keeps an inn on
the Bodmin road.

2828
03:37:42,240 --> 03:37:48,021
Mr Bassat has suspected him for some time
of terrible crimes, but it was not until this

2829
03:37:48,021 --> 03:37:51,870
morning that the full proof came into his
hands.

2830
03:37:51,870 --> 03:37:58,710
He left immediately for Launceston to get
help, and he intends to surround the inn tonight,

2831
03:37:58,710 --> 03:38:01,690
and seize the people inside.

2832
03:38:01,690 --> 03:38:07,381
He will go well armed, of course, and with
a large body of men, but I shall not rest

2833
03:38:07,381 --> 03:38:09,550
until he returns.'

2834
03:38:09,550 --> 03:38:17,580
'I came here to warn Mr Bassat that the landlord
intends to leave the inn tonight, and so escape

2835
03:38:17,580 --> 03:38:18,580
justice.

2836
03:38:18,580 --> 03:38:23,830
I have proof of his guilt, which I did not
believe Mr Bassat to possess.

2837
03:38:23,830 --> 03:38:29,011
You tell me that he has already gone, and
perhaps even now is at Jamaica Inn.

2838
03:38:29,011 --> 03:38:33,500
Therefore I have wasted my time in coming
here.'

2839
03:38:33,500 --> 03:38:40,801
Mary sat down then, her hands folded, and
looked unseeing into the fire.

2840
03:38:40,801 --> 03:38:45,710
She had come to the end of her strength and
for the moment, she could not look into the

2841
03:38:45,710 --> 03:38:46,710
future.

2842
03:38:46,710 --> 03:38:52,790
All that her tired mind could tell her was
that her journey this evening had been for

2843
03:38:52,790 --> 03:38:53,790
nothing.

2844
03:38:53,790 --> 03:38:59,040
'I have done a very stupid thing in coming
here,' she said miserably.

2845
03:38:59,040 --> 03:39:06,420
T thought it clever, but I have only succeeded
in making a fool of myself and of everyone

2846
03:39:06,420 --> 03:39:07,910
else.

2847
03:39:07,910 --> 03:39:13,480
My uncle will discover that my room is empty,
and guess that I have informed against him.

2848
03:39:13,480 --> 03:39:18,650
He will leave Jamaica Inn before Mr Bassat
arrives.'

2849
03:39:18,650 --> 03:39:21,500
Mrs Bassat came towards her.

2850
03:39:21,500 --> 03:39:29,840
'You have been placed in a terrible position,'
she said kindly, 'and I think you are very

2851
03:39:29,840 --> 03:39:35,061
brave to come here tonight, all those lonely
miles, to warn my husband.

2852
03:39:35,061 --> 03:39:39,630
The question is: what do you want me to do
now?

2853
03:39:39,630 --> 03:39:43,520
I will help you in any way you think best.'

2854
03:39:43,520 --> 03:39:50,460
'I can think of nothing but my poor aunt,
who at this moment may be suffering terribly.

2855
03:39:50,460 --> 03:39:57,450
I must know what is happening at Jamaica Inn,
if I have to walk back there myself tonight.'

2856
03:39:57,450 --> 03:40:03,050
'But you cannot possibly walk back there now,
alone.

2857
03:40:03,050 --> 03:40:07,030
I will order the carriage, and Richards will
go with you.

2858
03:40:07,030 --> 03:40:12,080
He can be trusted completely, and will carry
guns for your protection.

2859
03:40:12,080 --> 03:40:19,950
If there is fighting in progress, you need
not go near the inn until it is over.'

2860
03:40:19,950 --> 03:40:29,521
In a quarter of an hour, the carriage drove
up to the door, with Richards in charge.

2861
03:40:29,521 --> 03:40:36,240
Mary recognized him as the servant who had
ridden with Mr Bassat to Jamaica Inn before.

2862
03:40:36,240 --> 03:40:42,130
He wanted to know everything, of course, but
she gave short answers to his questions, and

2863
03:40:42,130 --> 03:40:44,479
did not encourage him.

2864
03:40:44,479 --> 03:40:49,770
The horse and carriage quickly covered the
miles that Mary had walked alone.

2865
03:40:49,770 --> 03:40:55,150
'We shall find them there before us, as likely
as not,' Richards told Mary.

2866
03:40:55,150 --> 03:41:00,220
'It will be a good thing for the neighbourhood
when he's in prison.

2867
03:41:00,220 --> 03:41:07,120
It's a pity we were not here sooner; there'll
have been some excitement in taking him, I

2868
03:41:07,120 --> 03:41:08,120
expect.'

2869
03:41:08,120 --> 03:41:14,130
'Little excitement if Mr Bassat finds his
man has escaped,' said Mary quietly.

2870
03:41:14,130 --> 03:41:19,431
'Joss Merlyn knows these moors like the back
of his hand.'

2871
03:41:19,431 --> 03:41:25,530
'My master was born here, just as the landlord
was,' said Richards.

2872
03:41:25,530 --> 03:41:32,860
'If it comes to a run across country, I'd
expect my master to win every time.

2873
03:41:32,860 --> 03:41:38,229
He has hunted here, as man and boy, for nearly
50 years.

2874
03:41:38,229 --> 03:41:42,690
But they'll catch Merlyn before he starts
to run, if I'm not mistaken.'

2875
03:41:42,690 --> 03:41:50,210
The steep hill to Jamaica Inn rose in front
of them, white beneath the moon, and as the

2876
03:41:50,210 --> 03:41:57,510
dark chimneys rose into view, Richards became
silent, examining his guns.

2877
03:41:57,510 --> 03:42:03,030
As they came near to the top of the hill,
Richards turned, and whispered in her ear,

2878
03:42:03,030 --> 03:42:09,910
'Would it be best for you to wait here, in
the carriage, by the side of the road, while

2879
03:42:09,910 --> 03:42:13,530
I go forward to see if they are there?'

2880
03:42:13,530 --> 03:42:18,870
'I've waited long enough tonight, and gone
half-crazy with it,' said Mary.

2881
03:42:18,870 --> 03:42:26,061
'I'd rather meet my uncle face to face than
stay behind here, seeing and hearing, nothing.

2882
03:42:26,061 --> 03:42:28,650
It's my aunt I'm thinking of.

2883
03:42:28,650 --> 03:42:32,740
She's as harmless as a child, and I want to
take care of her if I can.

2884
03:42:32,740 --> 03:42:36,560
Give me a gun and let me go.

2885
03:42:36,560 --> 03:42:41,450
I won't take any risks, I promise you.'

2886
03:42:41,450 --> 03:42:47,880
She went forward, then held her gun in front
of her and looked round the corner of the

2887
03:42:47,880 --> 03:42:49,570
stonewall into the yard.

2888
03:42:49,570 --> 03:42:51,761
It was empty.

2889
03:42:51,761 --> 03:42:54,230
The stable door was shut.

2890
03:42:54,230 --> 03:43:02,440
The inn was as dark and silent as when she
had left it nearly seven hours before; the

2891
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:04,670
windows and the door were barred.

2892
03:43:04,670 --> 03:43:11,490
There were no wheel marks in the yard, and
no preparations for escape.

2893
03:43:11,490 --> 03:43:17,229
She crept across to the stable and laid her
ear against the door.

2894
03:43:17,229 --> 03:43:23,180
She waited a moment, and then she heard the
horse move restlessly, she heard his feet

2895
03:43:23,180 --> 03:43:25,720
on the stone floor.

2896
03:43:25,720 --> 03:43:30,580
Then they had not gone, and her uncle was
still at Jamaica Inn!

2897
03:43:30,580 --> 03:43:37,840
Her heart sank, and she wondered if she should
return to Richards and wait until the magistrate

2898
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:39,700
and his men arrived.

2899
03:43:39,700 --> 03:43:46,940
Surely, if her uncle intended to leave, he
would have gone before now?

2900
03:43:46,940 --> 03:43:53,150
He might have changed his plans and decided
to go on foot, but then Aunt Patience could

2901
03:43:53,150 --> 03:43:54,880
never go with him.

2902
03:43:54,880 --> 03:43:59,470
Mary went round the corner of the house.

2903
03:43:59,470 --> 03:44:04,750
She came to where a crack of light would show
through the kitchen window shutter.

2904
03:44:04,750 --> 03:44:07,380
There was no light.

2905
03:44:07,380 --> 03:44:10,100
She laid her hand on the handle of the door.

2906
03:44:10,100 --> 03:44:14,971
It turned, to her surprise, and the door opened.

2907
03:44:14,971 --> 03:44:21,110
This easy entrance, completely unexpected,
surprised her for the moment and she was afraid

2908
03:44:21,110 --> 03:44:23,810
to enter.

2909
03:44:23,810 --> 03:44:30,180
Supposing her uncle sat on his chair, waiting
for her, his gun across his knee?

2910
03:44:30,180 --> 03:44:35,120
She had her own gun, but it gave her no confidence.

2911
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:40,200
Very slowly, she put her face around the door.

2912
03:44:40,200 --> 03:44:41,979
No sound came to her.

2913
03:44:41,979 --> 03:44:48,061
Out of the corner of her eye, she could see
the ashes of the fire, but they were hardly

2914
03:44:48,061 --> 03:44:49,810
red.

2915
03:44:49,810 --> 03:44:54,870
She knew then that the kitchen had been empty
for hours.

2916
03:44:54,870 --> 03:44:58,120
She pushed the door open, and went inside.

2917
03:44:58,120 --> 03:45:03,850
She lit the lamp and looked about her.

2918
03:45:03,850 --> 03:45:10,230
The door to the passage was wide open, and
the silence became more frightening than before,

2919
03:45:10,230 --> 03:45:12,870
strangely and terribly still.

2920
03:45:12,870 --> 03:45:20,510
Something was not as it had been; some sound
was missing that must account for the silence.

2921
03:45:20,510 --> 03:45:25,011
Then Mary realized that she could not hear
the clock.

2922
03:45:25,011 --> 03:45:28,229
It had stopped.

2923
03:45:28,229 --> 03:45:32,940
She stepped into the passage and listened
again.

2924
03:45:32,940 --> 03:45:39,750
She was right; the house was silent because
the clock had stopped.

2925
03:45:39,750 --> 03:45:44,750
She turned the corner, and she saw that the
clock, which always stood against the wall

2926
03:45:44,750 --> 03:45:48,990
beside the door, had fallen forward on to
its face.

2927
03:45:48,990 --> 03:45:54,431
The glass was in pieces on the stone floor,
and the wood had split.

2928
03:45:54,431 --> 03:45:59,710
The clock had fallen across the narrow hall,
and it was not until she came to the foot

2929
03:45:59,710 --> 03:46:05,190
of the stairs that Mary saw what was beyond
it.

2930
03:46:05,190 --> 03:46:12,400
The landlord of Jamaica Inn lay on his face
among the broken glass.

2931
03:46:12,400 --> 03:46:18,680
The fallen clock had hidden him at first;
he lay in the shadow, one arm thrown above

2932
03:46:18,680 --> 03:46:22,680
his head and the other holding the door.

2933
03:46:22,680 --> 03:46:27,970
There was blood on the stone floor; and blood
between his shoulders, dark now and nearly

2934
03:46:27,970 --> 03:46:32,450
dry, where the knife had entered him.

2935
03:46:32,450 --> 03:46:37,030
When he was attacked from behind, he must
have stretched out his hands, and fallen,

2936
03:46:37,030 --> 03:46:42,950
dragging at the clock; and when he fell on
his face, the clock had crashed with him to

2937
03:46:42,950 --> 03:46:50,720
the ground, and he had died there, trying
to reach the door.

2938
03:46:50,720 --> 03:46:53,991
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Pedlar Is Found

2939
03:46:53,991 --> 03:47:00,870
It was a long time before Mary moved away
from the stairs.

2940
03:47:00,870 --> 03:47:06,560
Something of her own strength had gone, leaving
her powerless like the figure on the floor.

2941
03:47:06,560 --> 03:47:11,150
It was the silence that frightened her most.

2942
03:47:11,150 --> 03:47:15,979
Now that the clock was no longer going, her
ears missed the sound of it.

2943
03:47:15,979 --> 03:47:22,120
Her light shone on the walls, but it did not
reach to the top of the stairs, where the

2944
03:47:22,120 --> 03:47:24,690
darkness waited for her.

2945
03:47:24,690 --> 03:47:31,561
She knew that she could never climb those
stairs again, nor walk along that upper passage.

2946
03:47:31,561 --> 03:47:34,860
Whatever lay above her must stay there.

2947
03:47:34,860 --> 03:47:40,101
She backed away down the hall along the passage,
and when she came to the kitchen and saw the

2948
03:47:40,101 --> 03:47:46,590
door still open, her self-control left her,
and she ran blindly through the door to the

2949
03:47:46,590 --> 03:47:51,979
cold air outside, where the familiar figure
of Richards met her.

2950
03:47:51,979 --> 03:47:58,010
He put out his hands to save her, and she
seized him, feeling for comfort, cold now

2951
03:47:58,010 --> 03:47:59,860
from the shock.

2952
03:47:59,860 --> 03:48:05,570
'He's dead,' she said; 'he's dead there on
the floor.

2953
03:48:05,570 --> 03:48:12,780
I saw him'; and, although she tried hard,
she could not stop shaking.

2954
03:48:12,780 --> 03:48:16,130
He led her to the side of the road, back to
the carriage.

2955
03:48:16,130 --> 03:48:21,710
'Has your aunt gone?' he whispered.

2956
03:48:21,710 --> 03:48:23,101
Mary shook her head.

2957
03:48:23,101 --> 03:48:25,351
'I don't know.

2958
03:48:25,351 --> 03:48:26,430
I didn't see.

2959
03:48:26,430 --> 03:48:29,940
I had to come away.'

2960
03:48:29,940 --> 03:48:32,610
He saw by her face that her strength had gone.

2961
03:48:32,610 --> 03:48:36,610
'All right, then,' he said, 'all right.

2962
03:48:36,610 --> 03:48:38,620
Sit quiet, then.

2963
03:48:38,620 --> 03:48:40,670
No one shall hurt you.

2964
03:48:40,670 --> 03:48:42,300
There now.'

2965
03:48:42,300 --> 03:48:46,650
His rough voice helped her, and she sat close
beside him.

2966
03:48:46,650 --> 03:48:51,310
'That was no sight for a girl to see; you
should have let me go.

2967
03:48:51,310 --> 03:48:55,480
I wish now you'd stayed back here in the carriage.

2968
03:48:55,480 --> 03:49:01,350
That's terrible for you, to see him lying
there, murdered.'

2969
03:49:01,350 --> 03:49:02,570
Talking helped her.

2970
03:49:02,570 --> 03:49:05,680
'The horse was still in the stable.

2971
03:49:05,680 --> 03:49:09,690
I listened at the door and heard it moving
about.

2972
03:49:09,690 --> 03:49:13,720
They had never even finished their preparations
for going.

2973
03:49:13,720 --> 03:49:19,160
The kitchen door was not locked, and there
were packages on the floor there, ready to

2974
03:49:19,160 --> 03:49:20,681
load into the wagon.

2975
03:49:20,681 --> 03:49:23,280
It must have happened several hours ago.'

2976
03:49:23,280 --> 03:49:29,130
'I don't know what the magistrate is doing,'
said Richards.

2977
03:49:29,130 --> 03:49:32,140
'He should have been here before this.

2978
03:49:32,140 --> 03:49:35,620
You should tell your story to him.

2979
03:49:35,620 --> 03:49:38,351
There's been bad work here tonight.'

2980
03:49:38,351 --> 03:49:43,200
They fell silent, and both of them watched
the road.

2981
03:49:43,200 --> 03:49:48,280
'Who could have killed the landlord?' said
Richards confused.

2982
03:49:48,280 --> 03:49:54,590
'He can deal with most men, and should have
been able to defend himself.

2983
03:49:54,590 --> 03:50:01,290
There were plenty who might have done it,
though if ever a man was hated, he was.'

2984
03:50:01,290 --> 03:50:05,841
'There was the pedlar,' said Mary slowly.

2985
03:50:05,841 --> 03:50:08,460
'I'd forgotten about him.

2986
03:50:08,460 --> 03:50:15,670
It must have been him, breaking out from the
locked room.'

2987
03:50:15,670 --> 03:50:23,271
She seized on this idea, to escape from another;
and she retold the story, eagerly now, of

2988
03:50:23,271 --> 03:50:26,350
how the pedlar had come to the inn the night
before.

2989
03:50:26,350 --> 03:50:34,120
It seemed then that the crime was proved,
and there could be no other explanation.

2990
03:50:34,120 --> 03:50:38,940
'He'll not run far before the magistrate catches
him,' said Richards.

2991
03:50:38,940 --> 03:50:45,610
'No one can hide on these moors, unless he's
a local man, and I've never heard of Harry

2992
03:50:45,610 --> 03:50:47,190
the pedlar before.

2993
03:50:47,190 --> 03:50:55,090
But then, they came from every hole and corner
in Cornwall, Joss Merlyn's men.

2994
03:50:55,090 --> 03:50:58,480
They were the lowest of the low from the whole
area.'

2995
03:50:58,480 --> 03:51:07,320
He paused, and then: 'I'll go to the inn,
if you would like me to, and see for myself

2996
03:51:07,320 --> 03:51:10,900
whether he has left any tracks behind him.

2997
03:51:10,900 --> 03:51:14,200
There might be something

2998
03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:16,720
Mary seized hold of his arm.

2999
03:51:16,720 --> 03:51:21,391
'I don't want to be alone again,' she said
quickly.

3000
03:51:21,391 --> 03:51:25,221
'Think me a fool if you will, but I couldn't
bear it.

3001
03:51:25,221 --> 03:51:31,631
If you had been inside Jamaica Inn tonight,
you would understand...

3002
03:51:31,631 --> 03:51:33,479
Something has happened to my aunt as well.

3003
03:51:33,479 --> 03:51:34,900
I know that.

3004
03:51:34,900 --> 03:51:37,280
I know she is dead.

3005
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:41,801
That's why I was afraid to go upstairs.

3006
03:51:41,801 --> 03:51:45,650
She's lying there in the darkness, in the
passage above.

3007
03:51:45,650 --> 03:51:50,290
Whoever killed my uncle will have killed her
too.'

3008
03:51:50,290 --> 03:51:53,230
The servant coughed.

3009
03:51:53,230 --> 03:51:56,420
'She may have run out on to the moor.

3010
03:51:56,420 --> 03:51:59,780
She may have run for help along the road.'

3011
03:51:59,780 --> 03:52:06,120
'No,' whispered Mary, 'she would never have
done that.

3012
03:52:06,120 --> 03:52:09,580
She would be with him now, by his side.

3013
03:52:09,580 --> 03:52:11,200
She's dead.

3014
03:52:11,200 --> 03:52:14,440
I know she's dead.

3015
03:52:14,440 --> 03:52:18,190
If I hadn't left her, this would never have
happened.'

3016
03:52:18,190 --> 03:52:21,430
The man was silent.

3017
03:52:21,430 --> 03:52:23,170
He could not help her.

3018
03:52:23,170 --> 03:52:30,620
After all, she was a stranger to him, and
what had happened was no concern of his.

3019
03:52:30,620 --> 03:52:34,880
Mary held up a warning hand.

3020
03:52:34,880 --> 03:52:37,100
'Listen,' she said.

3021
03:52:37,100 --> 03:52:39,620
'Can you hear something?'

3022
03:52:39,620 --> 03:52:41,900
They looked to the north.

3023
03:52:41,900 --> 03:52:45,510
The distant sound of horses was unmistakable.

3024
03:52:45,510 --> 03:52:49,570
'It's them!' said Richards excitedly.

3025
03:52:49,570 --> 03:52:54,200
'It's the magistrate; he's coming at last.'

3026
03:52:54,200 --> 03:52:55,470
They waited.

3027
03:52:55,470 --> 03:53:03,110
The noise drew near, and Richards in his relief
ran out on to the road to greet them, shouting

3028
03:53:03,110 --> 03:53:04,610
and waving his arms.

3029
03:53:04,610 --> 03:53:10,540
The leader pulled up his horse, calling out
in surprise at the sight of him.

3030
03:53:10,540 --> 03:53:12,631
'What are you doing here?' he shouted.

3031
03:53:12,631 --> 03:53:18,229
It was Mr Bassat himself.

3032
03:53:18,229 --> 03:53:21,660
He held up his hand to warn his followers
behind.

3033
03:53:21,660 --> 03:53:25,680
'The landlord is dead, murdered!'

3034
03:53:25,680 --> 03:53:27,170
cried his servant.

3035
03:53:27,170 --> 03:53:30,740
'I have a young relative of his here with
me in the carriage.

3036
03:53:30,740 --> 03:53:36,160
It was Mrs Bassat who sent me out here, sir.'

3037
03:53:36,160 --> 03:53:42,050
He held the horse for his master, answering
as well as he could the rapid questions put

3038
03:53:42,050 --> 03:53:43,050
to him.

3039
03:53:43,050 --> 03:53:49,500
'If the man has been murdered, he deserved
it, but I'd still rather have put him in chains

3040
03:53:49,500 --> 03:53:50,500
myself.

3041
03:53:50,500 --> 03:53:53,690
You cannot punish a dead man.'

3042
03:53:53,690 --> 03:53:59,900
The magistrate, whose mind worked slowly,
began to realize what Mary was doing in the

3043
03:53:59,900 --> 03:54:01,620
carriage.

3044
03:54:01,620 --> 03:54:05,690
He had thought at first that she was his servant's
prisoner.

3045
03:54:05,690 --> 03:54:11,070
'This is too difficult for me to understand,'
he said.

3046
03:54:11,070 --> 03:54:15,931
'I believed you to be working with your uncle
against the law.

3047
03:54:15,931 --> 03:54:19,729
Why did you lie to me, when I came earlier
in the month?

3048
03:54:19,729 --> 03:54:21,730
You told me you knew nothing.'

3049
03:54:21,730 --> 03:54:26,040
'I lied because of my aunt,' said Mary.

3050
03:54:26,040 --> 03:54:33,220
'Whatever I said to you then was only for
her, nor did I know as much then as I do now.'

3051
03:54:33,220 --> 03:54:40,710
'You did a brave thing in walking all that
way to Altarnun to warn me; but-all this trouble

3052
03:54:40,710 --> 03:54:46,170
could have been avoided, and the terrible
crime of that night could have been prevented

3053
03:54:46,170 --> 03:54:48,840
if you had been open with me before.

3054
03:54:48,840 --> 03:54:52,370
But we can talk about that later.

3055
03:54:52,370 --> 03:54:56,890
I must ask you to wait in the yard.'

3056
03:54:56,890 --> 03:55:03,070
He led his men round the back, and before
long, the dark and silent house seemed to

3057
03:55:03,070 --> 03:55:04,070
come to life.

3058
03:55:04,070 --> 03:55:12,070
The windows were thrown open, and some of
the men went upstairs and explored the rooms

3059
03:55:12,070 --> 03:55:13,070
above.

3060
03:55:13,070 --> 03:55:16,740
Someone called sharply from the house.

3061
03:55:16,740 --> 03:55:23,030
After a time the magistrate himself came out
into the yard and walked over to the carriage.

3062
03:55:23,030 --> 03:55:26,610
'I'm sorry,' he said.

3063
03:55:26,610 --> 03:55:28,571
'I have bad news for you.

3064
03:55:28,571 --> 03:55:33,300
Perhaps you expected it.'

3065
03:55:33,300 --> 03:55:36,630
'Yes,' said Mary.

3066
03:55:36,630 --> 03:55:40,140
'I don't think she suffered at all.

3067
03:55:40,140 --> 03:55:44,630
She was lying just inside the bedroom at the
end of the passage.

3068
03:55:44,630 --> 03:55:48,070
Killed with a knife, like your uncle.

3069
03:55:48,070 --> 03:55:49,760
She could have known nothing.

3070
03:55:49,760 --> 03:55:53,500
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

3071
03:55:53,500 --> 03:55:56,700
I wish I could have kept this from you.'

3072
03:55:56,700 --> 03:56:02,970
He stood by her awkwardly; and then, seeing
that Mary was better left alone, he walked

3073
03:56:02,970 --> 03:56:06,560
back across the yard to the inn.

3074
03:56:06,560 --> 03:56:12,110
Mary sat without moving and prayed in her
own way that Aunt Patience would understand

3075
03:56:12,110 --> 03:56:18,060
what she had tried to do, and would forgive
her and find peace now, wherever she might

3076
03:56:18,060 --> 03:56:20,590
be.

3077
03:56:20,590 --> 03:56:26,940
Once again, there was excitement in the house
- shouting and the sound of running feet.

3078
03:56:26,940 --> 03:56:31,410
There was a crash of splitting wood and the
shutters were torn away from the windows of

3079
03:56:31,410 --> 03:56:37,280
the locked room, which no one, it seemed,
had entered until now Then round the corner

3080
03:56:37,280 --> 03:56:43,561
of the yard they came, six or seven of them
led by the magistrate, holding among them

3081
03:56:43,561 --> 03:56:45,900
something that fought to escape.

3082
03:56:45,900 --> 03:56:47,450
'They've got him!

3083
03:56:47,450 --> 03:56:50,850
It's the murderer!'

3084
03:56:50,850 --> 03:56:52,180
shouted Richards.

3085
03:56:52,180 --> 03:57:00,900
The prisoner looked up at her, his face and
clothes dirty; it was Harry the pedlar.

3086
03:57:00,900 --> 03:57:05,360
'What do you know of this man?'

3087
03:57:05,360 --> 03:57:07,440
the magistrate said to Mary.

3088
03:57:07,440 --> 03:57:11,690
'We found him in the locked room there, lying
on the floor.

3089
03:57:11,690 --> 03:57:15,690
He says he knows nothing of the crime.'

3090
03:57:15,690 --> 03:57:22,681
'He was one of the company,' said Mary slowly,
'and he came to the inn last night and quarrelled

3091
03:57:22,681 --> 03:57:24,710
with my uncle.

3092
03:57:24,710 --> 03:57:30,650
My uncle aimed a gun at him, and locked him
up in the locked room, threatening him with

3093
03:57:30,650 --> 03:57:31,650
death.

3094
03:57:31,650 --> 03:57:37,229
He had every reason to kill my uncle, and
no one could have done it except him.

3095
03:57:37,229 --> 03:57:38,229
He is lying to you.'

3096
03:57:38,229 --> 03:57:45,900
'But the door was locked; it took three of
us to break it down from the outside.

3097
03:57:45,900 --> 03:57:49,630
This man had never been out of the room at
all.

3098
03:57:49,630 --> 03:57:55,320
Look at his clothes; look at his eyes, blinded
still by our light!

3099
03:57:55,320 --> 03:57:59,490
He's not your murderer.'

3100
03:57:59,490 --> 03:58:03,980
Mary knew then that what Mr Bassat had said
was the truth.

3101
03:58:03,980 --> 03:58:07,729
Harry the pedlar could not have done the murders.

3102
03:58:07,729 --> 03:58:14,320
'We'll have him in prison, in spite of that,
and hang him too, if he deserves it, which

3103
03:58:14,320 --> 03:58:16,350
I'll swear he does.

3104
03:58:16,350 --> 03:58:21,690
But first he shall give us the names of his
companions.

3105
03:58:21,690 --> 03:58:27,020
One of them has killed the landlord, you may
be sure of that, and we'll track him down

3106
03:58:27,020 --> 03:58:31,960
if we have to set every dog in Cornwall on
his heels.'

3107
03:58:31,960 --> 03:58:39,121
They dragged the pedlar away, swearing and
begging them to let him go, turning his rat's

3108
03:58:39,121 --> 03:58:45,660
eyes now and again on Mary, who sat above
him in the carriage a few yards away.

3109
03:58:45,660 --> 03:58:51,430
She neither heard his curses nor saw his ugly
narrow eyes.

3110
03:58:51,430 --> 03:58:56,440
She remembered other eyes that had looked
at her that morning, and another voice that

3111
03:58:56,440 --> 03:59:03,020
had spoken calmly and coldly, saying of his
brother: 'He shall die for this.'

3112
03:59:03,020 --> 03:59:11,100
There was the sentence, thrown out carelessly
on the way to Launceston fair: 'I have never

3113
03:59:11,100 --> 03:59:19,479
killed a man - yet'; and there was the old
woman in the market square: 'There's blood

3114
03:59:19,479 --> 03:59:25,740
on your hands; you'll kill a man one day.'

3115
03:59:25,740 --> 03:59:33,190
All the little things she wanted to forget
rose up and shouted against Jem: his hatred

3116
03:59:33,190 --> 03:59:37,460
of his brother, his cruelty, his bad Merlyn
blood.

3117
03:59:37,460 --> 03:59:47,910
He had gone to Jamaica Inn as he had promised,
and his brother had died, as he had sworn.

3118
03:59:47,910 --> 03:59:52,140
The whole truth was there in front of her
in its ugliness.

3119
03:59:52,140 --> 03:59:59,050
He was a thief, and like a thief in the night,
he had come and gone again.

3120
03:59:59,050 --> 04:00:06,900
When morning came, he would jump on a horse,
and ride away out of Cornwall forever, a murderer

3121
04:00:06,900 --> 04:00:09,210
like his father before him.

3122
04:00:09,210 --> 04:00:16,570
In her imagination, she heard the sound of
his horse on the road, far away in the quiet

3123
04:00:16,570 --> 04:00:17,570
night.

3124
04:00:17,570 --> 04:00:23,021
But the sound she heard was not the dream
thing of her imagination, but the real sound

3125
04:00:23,021 --> 04:00:25,729
of a horse coming towards her.

3126
04:00:25,729 --> 04:00:28,250
She turned her head and listened.

3127
04:00:28,250 --> 04:00:31,680
The sound of a horse drew nearer still.

3128
04:00:31,680 --> 04:00:33,740
She was not alone now as she listened.

3129
04:00:33,740 --> 04:00:41,229
The men looked towards the road, and Richards
went quickly to the inn to call the magistrate.

3130
04:00:41,229 --> 04:00:46,311
The sound of the horseman was loud now as
he came over the top of the hill, and when

3131
04:00:46,311 --> 04:00:50,970
he came into view Mr Bassat came out of the
inn.

3132
04:00:50,970 --> 04:00:53,520
'Stop!' he called.

3133
04:00:53,520 --> 04:00:55,860
'In the name of the King.

3134
04:00:55,860 --> 04:01:00,730
I must ask your business on the road tonight.'

3135
04:01:00,730 --> 04:01:03,650
The horseman turned into the yard.

3136
04:01:03,650 --> 04:01:09,610
When he took off his hat, his thick hair shone
white under the moon, and the voice that spoke

3137
04:01:09,610 --> 04:01:12,680
in answer was gentle and sweet.

3138
04:01:12,680 --> 04:01:21,820
'Mr Bassat of North Hill, I believe,' he said,
and he leant forward, with a note in his hand.

3139
04:01:21,820 --> 04:01:28,890
'I have a message here from Mary Yellan of
Jamaica Inn, who asks for my help in trouble;

3140
04:01:28,890 --> 04:01:34,320
but I see by the company here that I came
too late.

3141
04:01:34,320 --> 04:01:43,600
You remember me, of course; we have met before
- I am the Vicar of Altarnun.'

3142
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:46,540
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Truth Is Told

3143
04:01:46,540 --> 04:01:54,150
Mary sat alone in the living room in the vicar's
house and looked into the fire.

3144
04:01:54,150 --> 04:02:00,690
She had slept for a long time, and now felt
rested, but the peace, which she desired,

3145
04:02:00,690 --> 04:02:02,320
had not yet come to her.

3146
04:02:02,320 --> 04:02:07,170
They had all been kind to her, and patient.

3147
04:02:07,170 --> 04:02:12,311
The vicar had driven her himself in the carriage
to Altarnun, and they arrived there as his

3148
04:02:12,311 --> 04:02:15,420
church clock struck one.

3149
04:02:15,420 --> 04:02:20,790
He called his housekeeper from her home nearby,
the same woman that Mary had spoken with in

3150
04:02:20,790 --> 04:02:22,820
the afternoon.

3151
04:02:22,820 --> 04:02:27,640
She lit a fire and warmed a rough woollen
nightdress in front of it, while Mary took

3152
04:02:27,640 --> 04:02:33,910
off her clothes, and when the bed was ready
for her and the bedclothes turned back, Mary

3153
04:02:33,910 --> 04:02:38,650
allowed herself to be led to it like a child.

3154
04:02:38,650 --> 04:02:43,820
She would have closed her eyes immediately
but an arm came suddenly round her shoulders

3155
04:02:43,820 --> 04:02:48,620
and a voice said in her ear: 'Drink this.'

3156
04:02:48,620 --> 04:02:55,050
Francis Davey himself stood beside the bed,
with a glass in his hand, his strange eyes

3157
04:02:55,050 --> 04:02:58,610
looking into hers, pale and expressionless.

3158
04:02:58,610 --> 04:03:06,410
'You will sleep now,' he said, and she knew
from the bitter taste that he had put some

3159
04:03:06,410 --> 04:03:09,240
powder in the hot drink, which he had made
for her.

3160
04:03:09,240 --> 04:03:16,811
The last thing she remembered was those still
white eyes that told her to forget; and then

3161
04:03:16,811 --> 04:03:17,841
she slept.

3162
04:03:17,841 --> 04:03:22,400
It was nearly four in the afternoon before
she woke.

3163
04:03:22,400 --> 04:03:28,190
When she was dressed, and had gone below to
the living room, to find the fire burning

3164
04:03:28,190 --> 04:03:34,180
and the curtains closed and the vicar out
on some business, it seemed to her that responsibility

3165
04:03:34,180 --> 04:03:37,601
for the murders was hers alone.

3166
04:03:37,601 --> 04:03:44,460
Jem's face was always with her as she had
seen it last, tired and lined in the grey

3167
04:03:44,460 --> 04:03:49,280
light, and there had been a determination
in his eyes then that she had tried not to

3168
04:03:49,280 --> 04:03:50,950
see.

3169
04:03:50,950 --> 04:03:57,630
He had played an unknown part from beginning
to end, and she had shut her eyes to the truth.

3170
04:03:57,630 --> 04:04:04,801
She was a woman, and for no good reason - in
fact, against all reason - she loved him.

3171
04:04:04,801 --> 04:04:10,480
He had kissed her, and she was tied to him
forever.

3172
04:04:10,480 --> 04:04:16,311
She felt herself weakened in mind and body,
she who had been strong before.

3173
04:04:16,311 --> 04:04:23,330
One word to the vicar when he returned, and
a message to the magistrate, and Jem would

3174
04:04:23,330 --> 04:04:29,229
die with a rope round his neck as his father
had done, and she would return to Helford

3175
04:04:29,229 --> 04:04:30,960
and her old life.

3176
04:04:30,960 --> 04:04:34,560
But she knew that the word would never be
given.

3177
04:04:34,560 --> 04:04:41,050
Jem was safe from her, and he could ride away
with a song on his lips, forgetful of her,

3178
04:04:41,050 --> 04:04:47,860
and of his brother, and of God; while she
dragged through the years, bitter and miserable,

3179
04:04:47,860 --> 04:04:53,270
coming in the end to be known as a woman who
had been kissed once in her life and could

3180
04:04:53,270 --> 04:04:58,421
not forget it.

3181
04:04:58,421 --> 04:05:03,150
She heard the vicar's footsteps on the path
outside, and rose hurriedly.

3182
04:05:03,150 --> 04:05:06,240
'Forgive me,' he said.

3183
04:05:06,240 --> 04:05:10,000
'You did not expect me so soon.'

3184
04:05:10,000 --> 04:05:11,271
He took out his watch.

3185
04:05:11,271 --> 04:05:17,060
'You have had supper with me before, Mary
Yellan, and you shall have supper with me

3186
04:05:17,060 --> 04:05:23,820
again; but this time, if you do not mind,
you shall prepare the table and bring the

3187
04:05:23,820 --> 04:05:26,290
food from the kitchen.

3188
04:05:26,290 --> 04:05:32,950
I have some writing to do; that is, if you
have no objection.'

3189
04:05:32,950 --> 04:05:38,610
When the church clock said quarter to seven,
they sat down together at the table and he

3190
04:05:38,610 --> 04:05:40,690
helped her to some cold meat.

3191
04:05:40,690 --> 04:05:48,440
'I understand from Richards, servant to Mr
Bassat, that you suspected the pedlar of the

3192
04:05:48,440 --> 04:05:51,660
murder, and said so to Mr Bassat himself.

3193
04:05:51,660 --> 04:05:59,120
It is a pity for all of us that the locked
room proves that he did not do it.

3194
04:05:59,120 --> 04:06:06,500
He would have done very well as a man to hang,
and saved a lot of trouble.'

3195
04:06:06,500 --> 04:06:12,641
The vicar ate an excellent supper, but Mary
was only playing with her food.

3196
04:06:12,641 --> 04:06:13,810
He watched her.

3197
04:06:13,810 --> 04:06:18,750
'What has the pedlar done, that you hate him?'

3198
04:06:18,750 --> 04:06:21,130
'He attacked me once.'

3199
04:06:21,130 --> 04:06:23,720
'I thought so.

3200
04:06:23,720 --> 04:06:26,200
You managed to fight him off?'

3201
04:06:26,200 --> 04:06:28,610
'I believe I hurt him.

3202
04:06:28,610 --> 04:06:29,780
He didn't touch me again.'

3203
04:06:29,780 --> 04:06:30,780
'No.

3204
04:06:30,780 --> 04:06:33,581
I don't suppose he did.

3205
04:06:33,581 --> 04:06:36,340
When did this happen?'

3206
04:06:36,340 --> 04:06:39,101
'On Christmas Eve.'

3207
04:06:39,101 --> 04:06:42,150
'After I left you in the carriage?'

3208
04:06:42,150 --> 04:06:43,150
'Yes.'

3209
04:06:43,150 --> 04:06:46,710
'I'm beginning to understand.

3210
04:06:46,710 --> 04:06:50,410
You didn't return, then, to the inn that night.

3211
04:06:50,410 --> 04:06:54,280
You met the landlord and his friends on the
road?'

3212
04:06:54,280 --> 04:06:55,280
'Yes.'

3213
04:06:55,280 --> 04:07:01,400
'And they took you with them to the shore
to add to their sport?'

3214
04:07:01,400 --> 04:07:05,540
'Please, Mr Davey, do not ask me anymore.

3215
04:07:05,540 --> 04:07:09,660
I would rather not speak of that night ever
again.

3216
04:07:09,660 --> 04:07:12,931
There are some things that are best buried
deep.'

3217
04:07:12,931 --> 04:07:17,840
'You shall not speak of it, Mary Yellan.

3218
04:07:17,840 --> 04:07:24,760
I blame myself for having allowed you to continue
your journey alone...

3219
04:07:24,760 --> 04:07:31,431
Turning back to the pedlar, though, I feel
it was very careless of the murderer not to

3220
04:07:31,431 --> 04:07:34,210
have looked into the locked room.

3221
04:07:34,210 --> 04:07:36,280
He would most certainly have made the whole
affair more thorough.'

3222
04:07:36,280 --> 04:07:43,040
'You mean, he might have killed the pedlar
too?'

3223
04:07:43,040 --> 04:07:44,040
'Exactly.

3224
04:07:44,040 --> 04:07:50,920
If the murderer had known that he had attacked
you, he would have had a strong enough reason

3225
04:07:50,920 --> 04:07:54,590
to kill the pedlar twice over.'

3226
04:07:54,590 --> 04:08:00,900
Mary cut herself a piece of cake, which she
did not want, and forced it between her lips.

3227
04:08:00,900 --> 04:08:05,860
But the hand that held the knife was shaking.

3228
04:08:05,860 --> 04:08:12,051
'I don't see,' she said, 'how I am involved
in the matter.'

3229
04:08:12,051 --> 04:08:18,730
'You have too low an opinion of yourself.'

3230
04:08:18,730 --> 04:08:28,200
They continued to eat in silence, Mary with
lowered head and eyes fixed on her plate.

3231
04:08:28,200 --> 04:08:32,150
She knew that he was watching her to see the
effect of his words.

3232
04:08:32,150 --> 04:08:40,270
But at last she could wait no longer, and
a question burst from her: 'So Mr Bassat and

3233
04:08:40,270 --> 04:08:46,150
the rest of you have made little progress
after all, and the murderer is still free?'

3234
04:08:46,150 --> 04:08:51,430
'The organization appears to have been far
larger than was formerly supposed.

3235
04:08:51,430 --> 04:08:59,090
In fact, the pedlar even suggested that the
landlord of Jamaica Inn was their leader in

3236
04:08:59,090 --> 04:09:05,760
name only, and that your uncle had orders
from someone above him.

3237
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:09,790
That of course makes things look very different.

3238
04:09:09,790 --> 04:09:14,660
What have you to say about the pedlar's idea?'

3239
04:09:14,660 --> 04:09:17,730
'It is possible, of course.'

3240
04:09:17,730 --> 04:09:23,011
'I believe that you once made the same suggestion
to me?'

3241
04:09:23,011 --> 04:09:25,771
'I may have done.

3242
04:09:25,771 --> 04:09:26,771
I forget.'

3243
04:09:26,771 --> 04:09:36,640
'If this is so, it would seem that the unknown
leader and the murderer must be the same person.

3244
04:09:36,640 --> 04:09:39,040
Don't you agree?'

3245
04:09:39,040 --> 04:09:43,030
'Well, yes, I suppose so.'

3246
04:09:43,030 --> 04:09:46,250
'That should make the search easier.

3247
04:09:46,250 --> 04:09:52,740
We may forget most of the company, and look
for someone with a brain and some character.

3248
04:09:52,740 --> 04:09:57,980
Did you ever see such a person at Jamaica
Inn?'

3249
04:09:57,980 --> 04:09:59,700
'No, never.'

3250
04:09:59,700 --> 04:10:08,960
'He must have moved about secretly, possibly
in the silence of the night when you and your

3251
04:10:08,960 --> 04:10:10,910
aunt were asleep.

3252
04:10:10,910 --> 04:10:16,580
He would not have come by the road, because
you would have heard the noise of his horse.

3253
04:10:16,580 --> 04:10:19,600
So the man must know the moors.

3254
04:10:19,600 --> 04:10:25,181
That is why Mr Bassat intends to question
every local man within 10 miles.

3255
04:10:25,181 --> 04:10:34,960
So you see the net will close round the murderer,
and if he stays long he will be caught.

3256
04:10:34,960 --> 04:10:37,060
We are all sure of that.

3257
04:10:37,060 --> 04:10:39,560
Have you finished already?

3258
04:10:39,560 --> 04:10:42,689
You have eaten very little.'

3259
04:10:42,689 --> 04:10:43,689
'I'm not hungry.'

3260
04:10:43,689 --> 04:10:44,979
'I'm sorry about that.

3261
04:10:44,979 --> 04:10:48,810
Did I tell you that I saw a friend of yours
today?'

3262
04:10:48,810 --> 04:10:49,810
'No, you didn't.

3263
04:10:49,810 --> 04:10:52,930
I have no friends but yourself.'

3264
04:10:52,930 --> 04:10:55,070
'Thank you, Mary Yellan.

3265
04:10:55,070 --> 04:11:00,090
That's a kind thing to say to me.

3266
04:11:00,090 --> 04:11:04,900
But you're not being strictly truthful, you
know.

3267
04:11:04,900 --> 04:11:08,780
You have a friend; you told me so yourself.'

3268
04:11:08,780 --> 04:11:14,110
'I don't know who you mean, Mr Davey.'

3269
04:11:14,110 --> 04:11:15,440
'Come, now.

3270
04:11:15,440 --> 04:11:22,021
Didn't the landlord's brother take you to
Launceston fair?'

3271
04:11:22,021 --> 04:11:25,811
Under the table, Mary dug her fingernails
into her flesh.

3272
04:11:25,811 --> 04:11:28,511
'The landlord's brother?'

3273
04:11:28,511 --> 04:11:32,360
she repeated in order to delay her answer.

3274
04:11:32,360 --> 04:11:35,431
'I haven't seen him since then.

3275
04:11:35,431 --> 04:11:41,610
I believed him to be away.'

3276
04:11:41,610 --> 04:11:42,717
'No, he has been in the area since Christmas.

3277
04:11:42,717 --> 04:11:43,890
He told me so himself.

3278
04:11:43,890 --> 04:11:51,560
As a matter of fact, it had come to his ears
that I had given you shelter, and he came

3279
04:11:51,560 --> 04:11:54,189
up to me with a message for you.

3280
04:11:54,189 --> 04:11:58,730
"Tell her how sorry I am."

3281
04:11:58,730 --> 04:12:00,800
That is what he said.

3282
04:12:00,800 --> 04:12:05,770
I imagine that he meant that he was sorry
about your aunt.

3283
04:12:05,770 --> 04:12:10,800
It was just before I came away from North
Hill this evening when the discussion had

3284
04:12:10,800 --> 04:12:12,640
ended for the day.'

3285
04:12:12,640 --> 04:12:16,630
'Why was Jem Merlyn present at this discussion?'

3286
04:12:16,630 --> 04:12:21,979
'He had a right, I suppose, as brother of
the dead man.

3287
04:12:21,979 --> 04:12:28,700
He did not appear much moved by his death,
but perhaps they were not close.'

3288
04:12:28,700 --> 04:12:33,590
'Did - did Mr Bassat and the gentleman question
him?'

3289
04:12:33,590 --> 04:12:37,391
'There was a great deal of talk among them
the whole day.

3290
04:12:37,391 --> 04:12:40,771
Young Merlyn appears to have brains.

3291
04:12:40,771 --> 04:12:43,320
His answers were very clever.

3292
04:12:43,320 --> 04:12:47,890
He must have far better brains than his brother
ever had.

3293
04:12:47,890 --> 04:12:50,601
You told me he lived rather riskily, I remember.

3294
04:12:50,601 --> 04:12:56,351
He steals horses, I believe.'

3295
04:12:56,351 --> 04:12:57,431
Mary agreed.

3296
04:12:57,431 --> 04:13:02,170
Her fingers followed a pattern on the tablecloth.

3297
04:13:02,170 --> 04:13:07,320
'He seems to have done that when there was
nothing better to do, but when a chance came

3298
04:13:07,320 --> 04:13:13,979
for him to use his brains, he took it, and
one cannot blame him, I suppose.

3299
04:13:13,979 --> 04:13:19,470
No doubt he was well paid.'

3300
04:13:19,470 --> 04:13:25,160
The gentle voice wore away at her, and she
knew that he had defeated her.

3301
04:13:25,160 --> 04:13:27,900
She could no longer pretend that she did not
care.

3302
04:13:27,900 --> 04:13:30,000
'What will they do to him, Mr Davey?

3303
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:32,689
What will they do to him?'

3304
04:13:32,689 --> 04:13:41,780
The pale, expressionless eyes looked back
at her, and for the first time she saw a shadow

3305
04:13:41,780 --> 04:13:46,210
pass across them and a momentary surprise.

3306
04:13:46,210 --> 04:13:48,330
'Do?' he said.

3307
04:13:48,330 --> 04:13:49,510
'Why should they do anything?

3308
04:13:49,510 --> 04:13:56,830
I suppose he has made his peace with Mr Bassat
and has nothing more to fear.

3309
04:13:56,830 --> 04:14:04,940
They will hardly try to punish him for old
crimes after the service he has done them.'

3310
04:14:04,940 --> 04:14:07,210
'I don't understand you.

3311
04:14:07,210 --> 04:14:09,729
What service has he done?'

3312
04:14:09,729 --> 04:14:13,580
'Your mind works slowly tonight, Mary Yellan.

3313
04:14:13,580 --> 04:14:22,300
Did you not know that it was Jem Merlyn who
informed against his brother?'

3314
04:14:22,300 --> 04:14:27,500
She looked at him stupidly, her brain refusing
to work.

3315
04:14:27,500 --> 04:14:33,030
She repeated the words after him like a child
who learns a lesson.

3316
04:14:33,030 --> 04:14:37,410
'Jem Merlyn informed against his brother?'

3317
04:14:37,410 --> 04:14:42,610
The vicar pushed away his plate, and began
to clear the table.

3318
04:14:42,610 --> 04:14:44,220
'Yes, certainly.

3319
04:14:44,220 --> 04:14:50,490
It appears that it was Mr Bassat himself who
took away your friend from Launceston that

3320
04:14:50,490 --> 04:14:53,850
night, and carried him off to North Hill.

3321
04:14:53,850 --> 04:15:00,510
"You've stolen my horse," he said, "and you're
as big a criminal as your brother.

3322
04:15:00,510 --> 04:15:07,721
I've the power to throw you into prison tomorrow,
and you wouldn't set eyes on a horse for ten

3323
04:15:07,721 --> 04:15:09,140
years or more.

3324
04:15:09,140 --> 04:15:17,010
But you can go free if you bring me proof
that your brother at Jamaica Inn is the man

3325
04:15:17,010 --> 04:15:18,920
I believe him to be."

3326
04:15:18,920 --> 04:15:22,710
'Your young friend said "No!

3327
04:15:22,710 --> 04:15:26,750
You must catch him yourself if you want him."

3328
04:15:26,750 --> 04:15:34,100
But the magistrate told him about the latest,
bloodiest wreck and suggested he changed his

3329
04:15:34,100 --> 04:15:35,100
mind.

3330
04:15:35,100 --> 04:15:40,870
I understand that your friend escaped from
his chains, though, and ran away in the night;

3331
04:15:40,870 --> 04:15:47,760
but he came back yesterday morning, when they
did not expect to see him again, and went

3332
04:15:47,760 --> 04:15:52,960
straight up to the magistrate and said, as
calmly as you please.

3333
04:15:52,960 --> 04:15:58,630
"Very well, Mr Bassat, you shall have your
proof."

3334
04:15:58,630 --> 04:16:06,040
And that is why I remarked to you just now
that Jem Merlyn has a better brain than his

3335
04:16:06,040 --> 04:16:09,450
brother had.'

3336
04:16:09,450 --> 04:16:16,771
Mary looked blindly before her into space,
her whole mind split, as it were, by his information,

3337
04:16:16,771 --> 04:16:23,130
the evidence she had so fearfully and so painfully
built against the man she loved falling like

3338
04:16:23,130 --> 04:16:25,390
a house of cards.

3339
04:16:25,390 --> 04:16:34,810
'Mr Davey,' she said slowly, 'I believe I
am the biggest fool that ever came out of

3340
04:16:34,810 --> 04:16:35,810
Cornwall.'

3341
04:16:35,810 --> 04:16:42,221
'I believe you are, Mary Yellan,' said the
vicar.

3342
04:16:42,221 --> 04:16:48,620
After the gentle voice that she was used to,
the sharpness of these words was a punishment

3343
04:16:48,620 --> 04:16:50,811
in itself.

3344
04:16:50,811 --> 04:16:55,090
The anxiety and fear had gone from her at
last.

3345
04:16:55,090 --> 04:16:59,720
'What else did Jem Merlyn say and do?'

3346
04:16:59,720 --> 04:17:01,550
she asked.

3347
04:17:01,550 --> 04:17:03,720
The vicar looked at his watch.

3348
04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:10,650
'I wish I had time to tell you,' he said,
'but it is nearly eight already.

3349
04:17:10,650 --> 04:17:14,181
The hours go by too fast for both of us.

3350
04:17:14,181 --> 04:17:22,240
I think we have talked enough about Jem Merlyn
for the present.'

3351
04:17:22,240 --> 04:17:24,530
'Tell me something - was he at North Hill
when you left?'

3352
04:17:24,530 --> 04:17:26,310
'He was.

3353
04:17:26,310 --> 04:17:30,570
In fact, it was his last remark that hurried
me home.'

3354
04:17:30,570 --> 04:17:33,960
'What did he say to you?'

3355
04:17:33,960 --> 04:17:37,610
'He was not speaking to me.

3356
04:17:37,610 --> 04:17:43,730
He told Mr Bassat he intended to ride over
tonight to visit the blacksmith at Warleggan.

3357
04:17:43,730 --> 04:17:51,710
It's a long way from North Hill, but I expect
he can find his way in the dark.'

3358
04:17:51,710 --> 04:17:54,660
'What has it to do with you if he visits the
blacksmith?'

3359
04:17:54,660 --> 04:18:01,870
'He will show him the nail he picked up in
the grass down in the field below Jamaica

3360
04:18:01,870 --> 04:18:02,870
Inn.

3361
04:18:02,870 --> 04:18:08,650
The nail comes from a horse's shoe; the work
was carelessly done, of course.

3362
04:18:08,650 --> 04:18:17,700
The nail was a new one, and Jem Merlyn, being
a stealer of horses, knows the work of every

3363
04:18:17,700 --> 04:18:19,290
blacksmith on the moors.

3364
04:18:19,290 --> 04:18:23,301
"Look here," he said to the magistrate.

3365
04:18:23,301 --> 04:18:28,110
"I found it this morning in the field behind
the inn.

3366
04:18:28,110 --> 04:18:34,800
I'll ride to Warleggan with your permission,
and throw this in Tom Jory's face as an example

3367
04:18:34,800 --> 04:18:36,450
of bad work."'

3368
04:18:36,450 --> 04:18:39,021
'Well, and what then?'

3369
04:18:39,021 --> 04:18:44,310
'Yesterday was Sunday, was it not?

3370
04:18:44,310 --> 04:18:51,900
And on Sunday no blacksmith works unless he
has a special respect for his customer.

3371
04:18:51,900 --> 04:18:59,830
Only one traveller passed Tom Jory's workshop
yesterday, and begged for a new nail for his

3372
04:18:59,830 --> 04:19:05,680
horse's shoe, and the time was, I suppose,
somewhere near seven o'clock in the evening.

3373
04:19:05,680 --> 04:19:16,530
After which, the traveller continued his journey
- a journey which included a visit to Jamaica

3374
04:19:16,530 --> 04:19:17,761
Inn.'

3375
04:19:17,761 --> 04:19:22,230
'How do you know this?' said Mary.

3376
04:19:22,230 --> 04:19:33,380
'Because the traveller was the Vicar of Altarnun,'
he said.

3377
04:19:33,380 --> 04:19:38,970
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
The Night on the Moors

3378
04:19:38,970 --> 04:19:41,630
A silence had fallen on the room.

3379
04:19:41,630 --> 04:19:48,420
Although the fire burnt as steadily as ever,
the air was cold as it had not been before.

3380
04:19:48,420 --> 04:19:54,800
Each waited for the other to speak, and Mary
heard Francis Davey swallow once.

3381
04:19:54,800 --> 04:20:03,470
At last, she looked into his face, and saw
what she expected: the pale, steady eyes looking

3382
04:20:03,470 --> 04:20:12,010
at her across the table, cold no longer, but
burning in his white face like living things.

3383
04:20:12,010 --> 04:20:18,870
She knew now what he wanted her to know, but
still she said nothing, trying to gain time

3384
04:20:18,870 --> 04:20:19,870
to think.

3385
04:20:19,870 --> 04:20:25,729
'There is no longer any need for us to pretend,'
he said.

3386
04:20:25,729 --> 04:20:32,870
'You say to yourself, "What sort of man is
this Vicar of Altarnun?"

3387
04:20:32,870 --> 04:20:39,890
You say, "He is a strange product of nature,
and his world is not my world."

3388
04:20:39,890 --> 04:20:42,250
You are right, Mary Yellan.

3389
04:20:42,250 --> 04:20:52,140
I live in the past - long ago in the beginning
of time, when the rivers and the sea were

3390
04:20:52,140 --> 04:20:57,261
one, and the old gods walked the hills.'

3391
04:20:57,261 --> 04:21:03,700
He rose from his chair and stood before the
fire, a thin black figure with white hair

3392
04:21:03,700 --> 04:21:09,610
and pale eyes, and his voice was gentle now,
as she had known it first.

3393
04:21:09,610 --> 04:21:17,979
'If you studied history you would understand,'
he said, 'but you are a woman, living in the

3394
04:21:17,979 --> 04:21:23,480
nineteenth century, and because of this my
language is strange to you.

3395
04:21:23,480 --> 04:21:28,160
Yes, I am a strange product of nature and
of time.

3396
04:21:28,160 --> 04:21:33,900
I do not belong here, and I was born with
a desire for revenge against our times and

3397
04:21:33,900 --> 04:21:37,189
against the human race.

3398
04:21:37,189 --> 04:21:42,700
Peace is very hard to find in the nineteenth
century.

3399
04:21:42,700 --> 04:21:47,500
The silence has gone, even on the hills.

3400
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:51,980
I hoped to find it in the church, but its
teaching is false.

3401
04:21:51,980 --> 04:21:57,721
We can talk of these things later, though,
when we are no longer being hunted.

3402
04:21:57,721 --> 04:22:04,060
One thing at least - we have nothing to carry
and can travel light, as they travelled in

3403
04:22:04,060 --> 04:22:07,561
the old days.'

3404
04:22:07,561 --> 04:22:13,940
Mary looked up at him, holding tightly to
the sides of her chair.

3405
04:22:13,940 --> 04:22:18,150
'I don't understand you, Mr Davey.'

3406
04:22:18,150 --> 04:22:21,860
'You do; you understand me very well.

3407
04:22:21,860 --> 04:22:31,340
You know by now that I killed the landlord
of Jamaica Inn, and his wife too; nor would

3408
04:22:31,340 --> 04:22:35,551
the pedlar have lived if I had known of his
existence.

3409
04:22:35,551 --> 04:22:42,090
You have put the story together in your own
mind, while I talked to you just now.

3410
04:22:42,090 --> 04:22:48,940
You know that it was I who directed every
move made by your uncle, and that he was a

3411
04:22:48,940 --> 04:22:51,470
leader in name alone.

3412
04:22:51,470 --> 04:22:58,590
He was powerless without my orders, but the
greater his fame among his companions the

3413
04:22:58,590 --> 04:23:00,160
better he was pleased.

3414
04:23:00,160 --> 04:23:09,439
We were successful, and he served me well;
no other man knew our secret - that we were

3415
04:23:09,439 --> 04:23:10,439
partners.

3416
04:23:10,439 --> 04:23:15,380
'You were the difficulty, Mary Yellan.

3417
04:23:15,380 --> 04:23:19,860
When you came among us, I knew that the end
was near.

3418
04:23:19,860 --> 04:23:26,820
In any case, we had played the game to its
limit and the time had come to make an end.

3419
04:23:26,820 --> 04:23:33,830
How you troubled me with your courage and
your sense of justice, and how I admired you

3420
04:23:33,830 --> 04:23:35,070
for them!

3421
04:23:35,070 --> 04:23:41,190
Of course, you had to hear me in the empty
bedroom at the inn, and had to creep down

3422
04:23:41,190 --> 04:23:48,490
to the kitchen and see the rope on the beam;
that was the first piece of trouble that you

3423
04:23:48,490 --> 04:23:49,490
caused.

3424
04:23:49,490 --> 04:23:55,661
'And then you had to go out on the moor after
your uncle, who had an appointment with me

3425
04:23:55,661 --> 04:24:05,600
on Roughtor, and, losing him in the darkness,
meet myself and tell me your secrets.

3426
04:24:05,600 --> 04:24:14,860
Well, I became your friend, did I not, and
gave you good advice?

3427
04:24:14,860 --> 04:24:19,860
Which, believe me, could not have been improved
on by the magistrate himself.

3428
04:24:19,860 --> 04:24:22,350
Your uncle knew nothing of our strange friendship.

3429
04:24:22,350 --> 04:24:26,570
He caused his own death, by disobeying me.

3430
04:24:26,570 --> 04:24:33,590
I knew something of your determination, and
that time alone would quieten your suspicions.

3431
04:24:33,590 --> 04:24:39,220
But your uncle had to drink himself crazy
on the night before Christmas and, behaving

3432
04:24:39,220 --> 04:24:42,810
like a fool, put the whole country in a fever.

3433
04:24:42,810 --> 04:24:51,771
I knew then that when the rope was round his
neck he would play his last card and name

3434
04:24:51,771 --> 04:24:55,170
me as the leader.

3435
04:24:55,170 --> 04:25:03,950
Therefore he had to die, Mary Yellan, and
your aunt, who was his shadow; and, if you

3436
04:25:03,950 --> 04:25:12,520
had been at Jamaica Inn last night when I
passed by, you too - no, you would not have

3437
04:25:12,520 --> 04:25:16,360
died.'

3438
04:25:16,360 --> 04:25:22,360
He leant down to her and, taking her two hands,
he pulled her to her feet, so that she stood

3439
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:25,830
level with him, looking into his eyes.

3440
04:25:25,830 --> 04:25:30,931
'No,' he repeated, 'you would not have died.

3441
04:25:30,931 --> 04:25:34,479
You would have come with me as you will come
tonight.'

3442
04:25:34,479 --> 04:25:38,830
She looked back at him, watching his eyes.

3443
04:25:38,830 --> 04:25:45,410
They told her nothing - they were clear and
cold as they had been before - but his hold

3444
04:25:45,410 --> 04:25:47,479
on her arms was firm.

3445
04:25:47,479 --> 04:25:50,910
'You are wrong,' she said.

3446
04:25:50,910 --> 04:25:54,400
'You would have killed me then as you will
kill me now.

3447
04:25:54,400 --> 04:25:58,430
I am not coming with you, Mr Davey.'

3448
04:25:58,430 --> 04:26:05,210
'You have proved yourself a dangerous enemy,
and I prefer to have you by my side.

3449
04:26:05,210 --> 04:26:10,740
In time, we will be able to return to our
first friendship.'

3450
04:26:10,740 --> 04:26:16,680
'Any friendship we have shared was disgusting
and dishonourable.

3451
04:26:16,680 --> 04:26:20,960
You wear the clothes of a priest of God to
hide you from suspicion.

3452
04:26:20,960 --> 04:26:23,550
You talk to me of friendship -'

3453
04:26:23,550 --> 04:26:30,960
'Your refusal and anger please me more than
anything, Mary Yellan,' he replied.

3454
04:26:30,960 --> 04:26:38,250
'There is a fire about you that the women
of the old days possessed.

3455
04:26:38,250 --> 04:26:42,530
Your company is not a thing to be thrown to
one side.

3456
04:26:42,530 --> 04:26:44,780
Are you ready?

3457
04:26:44,780 --> 04:26:50,630
You understand me, the house is empty, and
your cries would be heard by no one.

3458
04:26:50,630 --> 04:26:53,630
I am stronger than you might suppose.

3459
04:26:53,630 --> 04:26:56,030
Your uncle knew my strength!

3460
04:26:56,030 --> 04:27:02,720
I don't want to hurt you, Mary Yellan, but
I shall have to if you try to fight me.

3461
04:27:02,720 --> 04:27:10,300
Come, where is that spirit of adventure that
you have made your own?

3462
04:27:10,300 --> 04:27:12,630
Where is your courage?'

3463
04:27:12,630 --> 04:27:16,771
She saw by the clock that he must already
have used up his allowance of time.

3464
04:27:16,771 --> 04:27:23,870
It was half past eight, and by now, Jem would
have spoken with the blacksmith at Warleggan.

3465
04:27:23,870 --> 04:27:28,290
Twelve miles lay between them perhaps, but
no more.

3466
04:27:28,290 --> 04:27:33,910
She thought rapidly, weighing the chances
of failure and success.

3467
04:27:33,910 --> 04:27:37,610
If she went now with Francis Davey she could
slow him down.

3468
04:27:37,610 --> 04:27:42,950
The law would follow close behind him, and
her presence would show them where he was

3469
04:27:42,950 --> 04:27:44,140
in the end.

3470
04:27:44,140 --> 04:27:50,700
If she refused to go, then there would be
a knife in her heart, at best.

3471
04:27:50,700 --> 04:27:58,060
She smiled then, and looked into his eyes,
having made her decision.

3472
04:27:58,060 --> 04:28:03,840
'I'll come with you, Mr Davey,' she said,
'but you will be sorry in the end.'

3473
04:28:03,840 --> 04:28:06,870
'I'll like you the better for it.

3474
04:28:06,870 --> 04:28:15,450
I'll teach you to live, Mary Yellan, as men
and women have not lived for 4,000 years or

3475
04:28:15,450 --> 04:28:16,450
more.'

3476
04:28:16,450 --> 04:28:20,150
'You'll find me no companion on the road,
Mr Davey.'

3477
04:28:20,150 --> 04:28:21,631
'Road?

3478
04:28:21,631 --> 04:28:24,530
Who spoke of roads?

3479
04:28:24,530 --> 04:28:32,430
We go by the moors and hills, and put our
feet on stone and grass as the ancient men

3480
04:28:32,430 --> 04:28:35,200
did before us.'

3481
04:28:35,200 --> 04:28:37,439
She went into the passage.

3482
04:28:37,439 --> 04:28:44,010
She was filled with the wild spirit of adventure,
and she had no fear of him, and no fear of

3483
04:28:44,010 --> 04:28:46,180
the night.

3484
04:28:46,180 --> 04:28:51,610
Nothing mattered now, because the man she
loved was free and had no mark of blood on

3485
04:28:51,610 --> 04:28:53,070
him.

3486
04:28:53,070 --> 04:28:59,250
She could love him without shame; she knew
that he would come to her again.

3487
04:28:59,250 --> 04:29:04,320
She imagined she heard him ride along the
road after them, and she heard his victorious

3488
04:29:04,320 --> 04:29:06,460
cry.

3489
04:29:06,460 --> 04:29:08,780
She followed Francis Davey.

3490
04:29:08,780 --> 04:29:12,610
The sight of horses was one for which she
was not prepared.

3491
04:29:12,610 --> 04:29:16,210
'Do you not plan to take the carriage?'

3492
04:29:16,210 --> 04:29:17,210
she said.

3493
04:29:17,210 --> 04:29:21,410
'No, Mary, we must travel light and free.

3494
04:29:21,410 --> 04:29:32,450
You can ride - every woman born on a farm
can ride - and I shall lead you.'

3495
04:29:32,450 --> 04:29:35,390
The night was dark, with a cold wind.

3496
04:29:35,390 --> 04:29:39,410
The sky was filled with low cloud, and the
moon was hidden.

3497
04:29:39,410 --> 04:29:45,630
There would be no light on the way, and the
horses would travel unseen.

3498
04:29:45,630 --> 04:29:50,900
She climbed onto hers, wondering whether a
shout and a wild cry for help would wake the

3499
04:29:50,900 --> 04:29:56,390
sleeping village, but even as the thought
passed through her mind she saw the flash

3500
04:29:56,390 --> 04:29:59,391
of steel in his hand, and he smiled.

3501
04:29:59,391 --> 04:30:05,250
'That would be a fool's trick, Mary,' he said.

3502
04:30:05,250 --> 04:30:11,072
'They go to bed early in Altar nun, and by
the time they were awake and rubbing their

3503
04:30:11,072 --> 04:30:19,170
eyes I would be away over the moor and you
- you would be lying on your face in the long

3504
04:30:19,170 --> 04:30:24,720
wet grass with your youth and beauty spoilt.

3505
04:30:24,720 --> 04:30:27,061
Come now!'

3506
04:30:27,061 --> 04:30:28,979
She said nothing.

3507
04:30:28,979 --> 04:30:34,510
She had gone too far in her game of chance,
and must play it to the finish.

3508
04:30:34,510 --> 04:30:41,370
He climbed on the other horse, tied hers to
it, and they set out on their strange journey.

3509
04:30:41,370 --> 04:30:47,840
They came to the edge of the moor and the
rough track leading to the stream, and then

3510
04:30:47,840 --> 04:30:53,310
headed across the stream and beyond to the
great black heart of the moor, where there

3511
04:30:53,310 --> 04:30:56,100
were no tracks and no paths.

3512
04:30:56,100 --> 04:31:03,261
The tors rose up around them and hid the world
behind, and the two horses were lost between

3513
04:31:03,261 --> 04:31:05,880
the steep hills.

3514
04:31:05,880 --> 04:31:10,450
Mary's hopes began to fail, as she looked
over her shoulder at the black hills that

3515
04:31:10,450 --> 04:31:12,280
rose behind her.

3516
04:31:12,280 --> 04:31:16,370
There was an ancient mystery about these moors.

3517
04:31:16,370 --> 04:31:22,320
Francis Davey knew their secrets, and he cut
through the darkness like a blind man in his

3518
04:31:22,320 --> 04:31:23,320
home.

3519
04:31:23,320 --> 04:31:25,620
'Where are we going?'

3520
04:31:25,620 --> 04:31:33,160
she said, at last, and he turned to her, smiling
beneath his wide black hat, and pointed to

3521
04:31:33,160 --> 04:31:34,210
the north.

3522
04:31:34,210 --> 04:31:36,790
'The Atlantic has been my friend before.

3523
04:31:36,790 --> 04:31:40,630
A ship shall carry us from Cornwall.

3524
04:31:40,630 --> 04:31:48,080
You shall see Spain, Mary, and Africa, and
learn something of the sun; you shall feel

3525
04:31:48,080 --> 04:31:52,120
the sand under your feet, if you wish.

3526
04:31:52,120 --> 04:31:56,450
I care little where we go; you shall make
the choice.

3527
04:31:56,450 --> 04:32:00,580
Why do you smile and shake your head?'

3528
04:32:00,580 --> 04:32:05,100
'I smile because everything you say is wild
and impossible.

3529
04:32:05,100 --> 04:32:12,510
You know as well as I do that I shall run
from you at the first chance - at the first

3530
04:32:12,510 --> 04:32:13,850
village perhaps.

3531
04:32:13,850 --> 04:32:20,300
I came with you tonight because you would
have killed me otherwise, but in daylight,

3532
04:32:20,300 --> 04:32:26,320
within sight and sound of men and women, you
will be as powerless as I am now.'

3533
04:32:26,320 --> 04:32:30,681
'I am prepared for the risk.

3534
04:32:30,681 --> 04:32:35,870
You forget that the north coast of Cornwall
is very unlike the south.

3535
04:32:35,870 --> 04:32:41,750
This north coast is as lonely as the moors
themselves, and you will see no man's face

3536
04:32:41,750 --> 04:32:47,340
but mine until we come to the place that I
plan to reach.'

3537
04:32:47,340 --> 04:32:53,530
'Supposing then that the sea is reached, and
we are on your ship, with the coast behind

3538
04:32:53,530 --> 04:32:54,530
us.

3539
04:32:54,530 --> 04:32:58,500
Name any place you please - Africa, or Spain.

3540
04:32:58,500 --> 04:33:05,830
Do you think that I would follow you there
and not tell about you, a murderer of men?'

3541
04:33:05,830 --> 04:33:10,309
'You will have forgotten it by then, Mary
Yellan.'

3542
04:33:10,309 --> 04:33:16,568
'Forgotten that you killed my mother's sister?'

3543
04:33:16,568 --> 04:33:20,229
'Yes, and more besides.

3544
04:33:20,229 --> 04:33:26,719
Forgotten the moors, and Jamaica Inn and your
own foolish feet that crossed my path.

3545
04:33:26,719 --> 04:33:34,359
Forgotten your tears on the road from Launceston,
and the young man who caused them...

3546
04:33:34,359 --> 04:33:38,648
Oh, don't bite your lip and look angry - I
can guess your thoughts.

3547
04:33:38,648 --> 04:33:45,379
I know the dreams and fears of women better
than you do yourself.'

3548
04:33:45,379 --> 04:33:53,309
They rode on in silence, and after a time
it seemed to Mary that the darkness of the

3549
04:33:53,309 --> 04:33:59,299
night became thicker and the air closer, nor
could she see the hills around her as she

3550
04:33:59,299 --> 04:34:00,299
had before.

3551
04:34:00,299 --> 04:34:06,139
The horses picked their way delicately and
now and again stopped as though uncertain

3552
04:34:06,139 --> 04:34:08,119
of their way.

3553
04:34:08,119 --> 04:34:12,920
The ground was soft and dangerous, and though
Mary could no longer see the land on either

3554
04:34:12,920 --> 04:34:19,410
side, she knew by the feel of the soft ground
that they were surrounded by marshes.

3555
04:34:19,410 --> 04:34:25,740
This explained the horses' fear, and she looked
at her companion to discover his feelings.

3556
04:34:25,740 --> 04:34:32,109
He leant forward, looking into the darkness
that every moment became thicker, and she

3557
04:34:32,109 --> 04:34:37,109
saw by his thin, tightly closed mouth that
he was using all his powers to find their

3558
04:34:37,109 --> 04:34:42,549
way, threatened suddenly with this new danger.

3559
04:34:42,549 --> 04:34:47,898
Mary thought of these same marshes as she
had seen them in the light of day - the long

3560
04:34:47,898 --> 04:34:55,309
brown grass blowing in the wind, while beneath
them the black water waited in silence.

3561
04:34:55,309 --> 04:35:00,340
She knew how the people of the moors themselves
could go wrong, so that he who walked with

3562
04:35:00,340 --> 04:35:05,869
confidence one moment could sink the next,
without warning.

3563
04:35:05,869 --> 04:35:11,309
Francis Davey knew the moors, but even he
might lose his way.

3564
04:35:11,309 --> 04:35:16,078
She heard her companion swallow, and the little
trick sharpened her fear.

3565
04:35:16,078 --> 04:35:19,199
He looked to the right and left.

3566
04:35:19,199 --> 04:35:23,559
And then, in front of them, barring their
further progress, there rolled out of the

3567
04:35:23,559 --> 04:35:31,100
night a great bank of low cloud, a white wall
that blocked out everything.

3568
04:35:31,100 --> 04:35:37,418
Francis Davey stopped the horses; they stood
trembling, the steam from their sides rising

3569
04:35:37,418 --> 04:35:39,309
and mixing with the cloud.

3570
04:35:39,309 --> 04:35:44,748
Then he turned to Mary, his white face as
expressionless as ever.

3571
04:35:44,748 --> 04:35:50,139
'The gods have gone against me after all,'
he said.

3572
04:35:50,139 --> 04:35:56,850
'To continue now among the marshes would be
worse than to return.

3573
04:35:56,850 --> 04:36:00,590
We must wait for the daylight.'

3574
04:36:00,590 --> 04:36:07,100
She said nothing, her first hopes returning
to her, but then she remembered that the weather

3575
04:36:07,100 --> 04:36:10,879
would be an enemy to the hunters as well as
to the hunted.

3576
04:36:10,879 --> 04:36:17,148
He urged the horses to the left, away from
the marsh, until they reached firmer ground

3577
04:36:17,148 --> 04:36:22,969
and loose stones, while the white cloud moved
up with them step by step.

3578
04:36:22,969 --> 04:36:30,539
'There will be rest for you, after all, Mary
Yellan,' he said, 'and a hole in the rocks

3579
04:36:30,539 --> 04:36:33,229
for your shelter and stone for your bed.

3580
04:36:33,229 --> 04:36:42,010
Tomorrow may bring the world to you again,
but tonight you shall sleep on Roughtor.'

3581
04:36:42,010 --> 04:36:47,859
The horses climbed slowly out of the cloud
to the black hills beyond.

3582
04:36:47,859 --> 04:36:52,898
Later, Mary sat with her back against a large
stone.

3583
04:36:52,898 --> 04:37:00,020
The great tor's broken top towered above them
while below them the clouds hung unchanged.

3584
04:37:00,020 --> 04:37:02,590
Up here, the air was pure and clean.

3585
04:37:02,590 --> 04:37:08,998
There was a wind that whispered in the stones;
its breath, sharp as a knife and cold, blew

3586
04:37:08,998 --> 04:37:10,629
on the rocks.

3587
04:37:10,629 --> 04:37:17,119
The horses were restless; they stood against
a rock for shelter, and turned now and again

3588
04:37:17,119 --> 04:37:19,510
towards their master.

3589
04:37:19,510 --> 04:37:28,299
He sat apart, a few yards away from his companion,
and sometimes she felt his eyes on her.

3590
04:37:28,299 --> 04:37:34,359
He was king here, alone in the silence, with
the great rocks to guard him and the cloud

3591
04:37:34,359 --> 04:37:36,729
below to hide him.

3592
04:37:36,729 --> 04:37:39,910
She thought how far they were from normal
life.

3593
04:37:39,910 --> 04:37:47,498
Here on the tor the wind whispered of fear,
bringing old memories of violence and hopelessness,

3594
04:37:47,498 --> 04:37:52,741
and there was a wild, lost note that sounded
in the stone high above Mary's head, on the

3595
04:37:52,741 --> 04:37:59,369
very top of Roughtor, as if the gods themselves
stood there with their great heads lifted

3596
04:37:59,369 --> 04:38:00,748
to the sky.

3597
04:38:00,748 --> 04:38:07,320
She imagined she could hear the whisper of
a thousand voices and the marching of a thousand

3598
04:38:07,320 --> 04:38:12,219
feet, and she could see the stones turning
into men beside her.

3599
04:38:12,219 --> 04:38:20,318
Their faces were inhuman, older than time,
as rough as the stone; and they spoke in a

3600
04:38:20,318 --> 04:38:25,148
language that she could not understand, and
their hands and feet were curved like the

3601
04:38:25,148 --> 04:38:26,168
feet of birds.

3602
04:38:26,168 --> 04:38:34,439
They turned their stone eyes on her, and looked
through her and beyond, paying no attention,

3603
04:38:34,439 --> 04:38:40,648
and she knew that she was like a leaf in the
wind, while they lived on, undying creatures

3604
04:38:40,648 --> 04:38:43,639
of ancient times.

3605
04:38:43,639 --> 04:38:49,529
They came towards her, shoulder to shoulder,
neither seeing nor hearing her, but moving

3606
04:38:49,529 --> 04:38:58,029
like blind things to destroy her...

3607
04:38:58,029 --> 04:39:03,229
She woke from this dream to reality, feeling
the vicar's hand on her mouth.

3608
04:39:03,229 --> 04:39:08,119
She would have struggled with him, but he
held her fast, speaking coldly in her ear

3609
04:39:08,119 --> 04:39:11,221
and telling her to be still.

3610
04:39:11,221 --> 04:39:16,699
He forced her hands behind her back and tied
them, using his own belt.

3611
04:39:16,699 --> 04:39:21,930
Then he took a cloth from the pocket of his
coat and folded it, and put it in her mouth,

3612
04:39:21,930 --> 04:39:27,379
tying it behind her head so that any sound
was now impossible.

3613
04:39:27,379 --> 04:39:31,498
When he had done this he helped her to her
feet, and he led her a little way beyond the

3614
04:39:31,498 --> 04:39:33,619
rocks to the slope of the hill.

3615
04:39:33,619 --> 04:39:38,920
'I have to do this, Mary, for both of us,'
he said.

3616
04:39:38,920 --> 04:39:43,290
'When we set out last night I did not expect
this cloud.

3617
04:39:43,290 --> 04:39:52,030
Listen to this, and you will understand why
I have tied you up, and why your silence may

3618
04:39:52,030 --> 04:39:53,558
still save us.'

3619
04:39:53,558 --> 04:39:56,888
He pointed downwards to the white cloud below.

3620
04:39:56,888 --> 04:40:01,978
'Listen,' he said again.

3621
04:40:01,978 --> 04:40:06,148
The darkness had broken above their heads
and morning had come.

3622
04:40:06,148 --> 04:40:10,570
To the east, a faint light came before the
pale sun.

3623
04:40:10,570 --> 04:40:15,770
The cloud was with them still, and hid the
moors below like a white sheet.

3624
04:40:15,770 --> 04:40:22,040
Then she listened, as he had told her, and
far away, from beneath the cloud, there came

3625
04:40:22,040 --> 04:40:24,840
a sound between a cry and a call.

3626
04:40:24,840 --> 04:40:32,030
It was too faint at first to tell what it
was; unlike a human voice, unlike the shouting

3627
04:40:32,030 --> 04:40:34,770
of men.

3628
04:40:34,770 --> 04:40:37,478
It came nearer, and Francis Davey turned to
Mary.

3629
04:40:37,478 --> 04:40:41,568
'Do you know what it is?' he said.

3630
04:40:41,568 --> 04:40:45,238
She looked back at him, and shook her head.

3631
04:40:45,238 --> 04:40:47,298
She had never heard the sound before.

3632
04:40:47,298 --> 04:40:53,200
'I'd forgotten that Mr Bassat keeps hunting
dogs in his stables.

3633
04:40:53,200 --> 04:40:58,558
It's a pity for both of us that I didn't remember.'

3634
04:40:58,558 --> 04:41:05,208
She understood; and with sudden fear of that
distant eager crying, she looked up at her

3635
04:41:05,208 --> 04:41:12,790
companion and from him to the two horses standing
as patiently as ever by the side of the rock.

3636
04:41:12,790 --> 04:41:20,110
'Yes,' he said, following her eyes, 'we must
let them loose and drive them down to the

3637
04:41:20,110 --> 04:41:21,110
moors below.

3638
04:41:21,110 --> 04:41:25,450
They would only lead the dogs to us.'

3639
04:41:25,450 --> 04:41:31,370
She watched him, sick at heart, as he untied
the horses and led them to the steep slope

3640
04:41:31,370 --> 04:41:32,918
of the hill.

3641
04:41:32,918 --> 04:41:38,048
Then he bent down to the ground, picked up
stones in his hands, and rained blow after

3642
04:41:38,048 --> 04:41:44,250
blow on their sides; they ran off in fear,
kicking stones and earth as they went, and

3643
04:41:44,250 --> 04:41:46,419
so disappeared into the white clouds below.

3644
04:41:46,419 --> 04:41:55,100
The crying of the dogs came nearer now, deep
and continuous, and Francis Davey ran to Mary,

3645
04:41:55,100 --> 04:42:00,090
pulling off his long black coat and throwing
his hat away on to the grass.

3646
04:42:00,090 --> 04:42:02,100
'Come,' he said.

3647
04:42:02,100 --> 04:42:10,208
'Friend or enemy, we are both in danger now.'

3648
04:42:10,208 --> 04:42:15,458
They climbed up the hill among the stones
and rocks, he with his arm round her, because

3649
04:42:15,458 --> 04:42:21,290
her tied hands made progress difficult; and
they ran in and out of pools, struggled knee-deep

3650
04:42:21,290 --> 04:42:27,208
in wet grass, climbing higher and higher to
the top of Roughtor.

3651
04:42:27,208 --> 04:42:35,708
Here, on the very top, the stone was strangely
shaped, twisted into the form of a roof.

3652
04:42:35,708 --> 04:42:40,520
Mary lay beneath this great stone, breathless
and bleeding.

3653
04:42:40,520 --> 04:42:45,548
He reached down to her, and though she shook
her head and made signs that she could climb

3654
04:42:45,548 --> 04:42:51,360
no further, he bent and dragged her to her
feet again, cutting at the belt that tied

3655
04:42:51,360 --> 04:42:54,228
her and tearing the cloth from her mouth.

3656
04:42:54,228 --> 04:43:03,658
'Save yourself then, if you can!' he shouted,
his eyes burning in his pale face, his white

3657
04:43:03,658 --> 04:43:05,798
hair blowing in the wind.

3658
04:43:05,798 --> 04:43:11,510
She held on to a table of stone some 10 feet
from the ground, while he climbed above her

3659
04:43:11,510 --> 04:43:17,540
and beyond, his thin black figure hanging
on the smooth surface of the rock.

3660
04:43:17,540 --> 04:43:23,340
The crying of the dogs was unearthly, coming
as it did from the sheet of cloud below, and

3661
04:43:23,340 --> 04:43:28,998
the sound was increased by the cries and shouting
of men, a confusion that filled the air with

3662
04:43:28,998 --> 04:43:32,978
sound and was the more terrible because it
was unseen.

3663
04:43:32,978 --> 04:43:39,298
The high clouds moved across the sky, and
the yellow sun swam into view between them.

3664
04:43:39,298 --> 04:43:45,190
The cloud below her melted away, and the land
that it had covered for so long looked up

3665
04:43:45,190 --> 04:43:49,458
at the sky, pale and new-born.

3666
04:43:49,458 --> 04:43:54,250
Mary looked down the sloping hillside; there
were little dots of men standing knee-deep

3667
04:43:54,250 --> 04:44:00,790
in the long grass, while the dogs ran in front
of them like rats among the fallen rocks.

3668
04:44:00,790 --> 04:44:07,878
They followed the track fast, SO men or more,
shouting and pointing up to the great tables

3669
04:44:07,878 --> 04:44:15,290
of rock, and as they came near, the sound
of the dogs filled the cracks and the hollows.

3670
04:44:15,290 --> 04:44:21,510
Somebody shouted again, and a man who knelt
on the ground about 50 yards from Mary lifted

3671
04:44:21,510 --> 04:44:23,908
his gun to his shoulder and fired.

3672
04:44:23,908 --> 04:44:31,388
The shot hit the rock without touching her,
and when he rose to his feet, she saw that

3673
04:44:31,388 --> 04:44:35,298
the man was Jem, and that he had not seen
her.

3674
04:44:35,298 --> 04:44:41,208
The dogs were running in and out among the
stones, and one of them jumped up at the rock

3675
04:44:41,208 --> 04:44:42,610
beneath her.

3676
04:44:42,610 --> 04:44:50,498
Then Jem fired once more; and, looking beyond
her, Mary saw the tall black figure of Francis

3677
04:44:50,498 --> 04:44:57,280
Davey standing out against the sky, on a wide,
flat rock high above her head.

3678
04:44:57,280 --> 04:45:04,910
He stood for a moment, his hair blowing in
the wind; and then he threw his arms wide,

3679
04:45:04,910 --> 04:45:12,690
as a bird throws his wings to fly, and fell
- down from his high rock to the wet grass

3680
04:45:12,690 --> 04:45:18,280
and the little scattered stones below.

3681
04:45:18,280 --> 04:45:21,350
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
A New Life

3682
04:45:21,350 --> 04:45:26,720
It was a hard, bright day in early January.

3683
04:45:26,720 --> 04:45:32,190
The holes in the road, which were generally
thick with mud or water, were covered with

3684
04:45:32,190 --> 04:45:35,578
thin ice, and the wheel tracks were white.

3685
04:45:35,578 --> 04:45:39,020
The air was cold.

3686
04:45:39,020 --> 04:45:44,820
Mary walked alone on the moor, and wondered
why it was that Kilmar, to the left of her,

3687
04:45:44,820 --> 04:45:47,120
no longer seemed threatening.

3688
04:45:47,120 --> 04:45:53,530
The moors were still empty, and the hills
were friendless, but the old sense of evil

3689
04:45:53,530 --> 04:45:58,238
had left them and she could walk on them without
fear.

3690
04:45:58,238 --> 04:46:03,718
She was free now to go where she chose, and
her thoughts turned to Helford and the green

3691
04:46:03,718 --> 04:46:05,690
valleys of the south.

3692
04:46:05,690 --> 04:46:13,620
She had a strange desire in her heart for
home and the sight of warm, friendly faces.

3693
04:46:13,620 --> 04:46:19,780
She remembered with pain every smell and sound
that had belonged to her for so long.

3694
04:46:19,780 --> 04:46:25,450
She was from the soil and would return to
it again, rooted to the earth as her fathers

3695
04:46:25,450 --> 04:46:28,208
before her had been.

3696
04:46:28,208 --> 04:46:34,020
Helford had given birth to her, and when she
died, she would be part of it once more.

3697
04:46:34,020 --> 04:46:40,750
Only among the woods and streams of her own
Helford valley would she know peace again.

3698
04:46:40,750 --> 04:46:47,030
There was a cart coming towards her from Kilmar,
across the white moor.

3699
04:46:47,030 --> 04:46:50,798
It was the one moving thing on the silent
plain.

3700
04:46:50,798 --> 04:46:56,270
She watched it with suspicion, for there were
no houses on this moor except Trewartha, and

3701
04:46:56,270 --> 04:46:59,260
Trewartha, she knew, stood empty.

3702
04:46:59,260 --> 04:47:03,558
She had not seen its owner since he had fired
past her at Roughtor.

3703
04:47:03,558 --> 04:47:10,840
'He's an ungrateful devil, like the rest of
his family,' the magistrate had said.

3704
04:47:10,840 --> 04:47:17,048
'If I hadn't helped him, he'd be in prison
now, with a long stay in front of him to break

3705
04:47:17,048 --> 04:47:18,270
his spirit.

3706
04:47:18,270 --> 04:47:20,510
I admit he did well.

3707
04:47:20,510 --> 04:47:27,308
He was the means of finding you, Mary, and
that black-coated murderer, but he's never

3708
04:47:27,308 --> 04:47:33,298
even thanked me for clearing his name in the
business, and has taken himself to the world's

3709
04:47:33,298 --> 04:47:34,360
end, for all I know.

3710
04:47:34,360 --> 04:47:40,918
There's never been a Merlyn yet that came
to any good, and he'll go the same way as

3711
04:47:40,918 --> 04:47:41,918
the rest of them.'

3712
04:47:41,918 --> 04:47:46,680
The cart came nearer to the slope of the hill.

3713
04:47:46,680 --> 04:47:52,148
The horse bent to pull its load, and she saw
that it was struggling with a strange pile

3714
04:47:52,148 --> 04:47:55,500
of pots and pans and furniture.

3715
04:47:55,500 --> 04:47:59,100
Someone was setting out on a journey with
his house on his back.

3716
04:47:59,100 --> 04:48:05,478
Even then, she did not realize the truth,
and it was not until the cart was below her

3717
04:48:05,478 --> 04:48:11,648
and the driver, walking by its side, looked
up to her and waved that she recognized Jem.

3718
04:48:11,648 --> 04:48:17,520
'Are you better?' he called, from beside the
cart.

3719
04:48:17,520 --> 04:48:22,498
'I heard that you were ill, and had been staying
in bed.'

3720
04:48:22,498 --> 04:48:27,308
'You must have heard wrong,' said Mary.

3721
04:48:27,308 --> 04:48:29,388
'I've been around the house at North Hill.

3722
04:48:29,388 --> 04:48:33,878
There's never been much the matter with me
except a hatred for this area.'

3723
04:48:33,878 --> 04:48:40,138
'There was some talk that you were to settle
there, and be a companion to Mrs Bassat.

3724
04:48:40,138 --> 04:48:45,318
Well, you'll lead an easy enough life with
them, I dare say.'

3725
04:48:45,318 --> 04:48:46,340
'No.

3726
04:48:46,340 --> 04:48:49,340
I'm going back home to Helford.'

3727
04:48:49,340 --> 04:48:51,718
'What will you do there?'

3728
04:48:51,718 --> 04:48:58,048
'I shall try to start the farm again, or at
least work my way to it, because I haven't

3729
04:48:58,048 --> 04:48:59,770
the money yet.

3730
04:48:59,770 --> 04:49:01,900
I've friends there who will help me.'

3731
04:49:01,900 --> 04:49:04,648
'Where will you live?'

3732
04:49:04,648 --> 04:49:08,120
'I would be welcome in any house in the village.

3733
04:49:08,120 --> 04:49:11,760
We're good neighbours in the south, you know.'

3734
04:49:11,760 --> 04:49:17,208
'I've never had neighbours, so I cannot say,
but I've always had the feeling that it would

3735
04:49:17,208 --> 04:49:20,760
be like living in a box, to live in a village.

3736
04:49:20,760 --> 04:49:26,998
You put your nose over your gate into another
man's garden, and if his flowers are better

3737
04:49:26,998 --> 04:49:32,260
than yours there's an argument; and you know
that if you cook a rabbit for your supper

3738
04:49:32,260 --> 04:49:35,228
he'll have the smell of it in his kitchen.

3739
04:49:35,228 --> 04:49:39,128
That's no life for anyone!

3740
04:49:39,128 --> 04:49:47,360
Here's my home, Mary, all the home I've ever
had, here on the cart, and I'll take it with

3741
04:49:47,360 --> 04:49:50,370
me and set it up wherever I want to.

3742
04:49:50,370 --> 04:49:58,068
I've been a wanderer since I was a boy; never
any ties, nor roots, nor wishes, for any length

3743
04:49:58,068 --> 04:50:02,408
of time; and I dare say I'll die a wanderer
too.

3744
04:50:02,408 --> 04:50:06,128
It's the only life in the world for me.'

3745
04:50:06,128 --> 04:50:12,780
'There's no peace, Jem, in wandering, and
no quiet.

3746
04:50:12,780 --> 04:50:18,540
There'll come a time when you'll want your
own piece of ground, and your four walls,

3747
04:50:18,540 --> 04:50:23,860
and your roof, and somewhere to rest your
poor, tired bones.'

3748
04:50:23,860 --> 04:50:31,998
'The whole country belongs to me, Mary, with
the sky for a roof and the earth for a bed.

3749
04:50:31,998 --> 04:50:33,378
You don't understand.

3750
04:50:33,378 --> 04:50:37,990
You're a woman, and your home is everything
to you.

3751
04:50:37,990 --> 04:50:41,840
I've never lived like that, and never shall.

3752
04:50:41,840 --> 04:50:46,680
I'll sleep on the hills one night, and in
a city the next.

3753
04:50:46,680 --> 04:50:53,638
I like to find my fortune here and there and
everywhere, with strangers for company and

3754
04:50:53,638 --> 04:50:55,718
passers-by for friends.

3755
04:50:55,718 --> 04:51:03,480
Today I meet a man on the road, and travel
with him for an hour or for a year, and tomorrow

3756
04:51:03,480 --> 04:51:05,228
he is gone again.

3757
04:51:05,228 --> 04:51:08,920
We speak a different language, you and I.'

3758
04:51:08,920 --> 04:51:12,458
'Which way will you go?'

3759
04:51:12,458 --> 04:51:16,010
'Somewhere east of the river.

3760
04:51:16,010 --> 04:51:17,120
It doesn't matter to me.

3761
04:51:17,120 --> 04:51:23,568
I'll never come west again - not until I'm
old and grey, and have forgotten many things.

3762
04:51:23,568 --> 04:51:26,228
I thought of going to the north.

3763
04:51:26,228 --> 04:51:33,241
They're rich up there, and open to new ideas;
there'll be a fortune there for a man who

3764
04:51:33,241 --> 04:51:34,668
goes to find it.

3765
04:51:34,668 --> 04:51:41,080
Perhaps I'll have money one day, and buy horses
instead of stealing them.'

3766
04:51:41,080 --> 04:51:45,170
'It's an ugly black country in the north.'

3767
04:51:45,170 --> 04:51:48,490
'I don't worry about the colour of the soil.

3768
04:51:48,490 --> 04:51:52,398
Moorland soil is black, isn't it?

3769
04:51:52,398 --> 04:51:56,760
And so is the rain when it falls among your
pigs down at Helford.

3770
04:51:56,760 --> 04:51:58,158
What's the difference?'

3771
04:51:58,158 --> 04:52:06,238
'You talk just to argue with me, Jem - there's
no sense in what you say.'

3772
04:52:06,238 --> 04:52:13,040
'How can I be sensible when you lean against
my horse with your hair blowing in the wind?

3773
04:52:13,040 --> 04:52:19,158
I know that in five or ten minutes' time I
shall be over that hill without you.

3774
04:52:19,158 --> 04:52:25,600
My face will be turned towards the river and
you will be walking back to North Hill to

3775
04:52:25,600 --> 04:52:27,818
drink tea with Mr Bassat.'

3776
04:52:27,818 --> 04:52:33,690
'Delay your journey, then, and come to North
Hill too.'

3777
04:52:33,690 --> 04:52:36,430
'Don't be a fool, Mary.

3778
04:52:36,430 --> 04:52:43,780
Can you see me drinking tea with the magistrate,
and dancing his children on my knee?

3779
04:52:43,780 --> 04:52:48,138
I don't belong to his class, and neither do
you.'

3780
04:52:48,138 --> 04:52:49,728
'I know that.

3781
04:52:49,728 --> 04:52:53,668
And I'm going back to Helford because of it.

3782
04:52:53,668 --> 04:52:58,668
I want to smell the river again, and walk
in my own country.'

3783
04:52:58,668 --> 04:53:05,728
'Go on, then; turn your back on me and start
walking now.

3784
04:53:05,728 --> 04:53:09,128
You'll come to a road that will take you to
Helford.'

3785
04:53:09,128 --> 04:53:14,270
'You're very hard today, and cruel.'

3786
04:53:14,270 --> 04:53:19,078
'I'm hard with my horses when they won't do
as I say but that doesn't mean that I love

3787
04:53:19,078 --> 04:53:20,700
them any the less.'

3788
04:53:20,700 --> 04:53:28,930
'You've never loved anything in your life,'
said Mary 'I haven't had much use for the

3789
04:53:28,930 --> 04:53:31,818
word, that's why,' he told her.

3790
04:53:31,818 --> 04:53:36,398
'It's past midday already, and I ought to
be on the road.

3791
04:53:36,398 --> 04:53:43,860
If you were a man I'd ask you to come with
me, and you'd jump on to the seat and put

3792
04:53:43,860 --> 04:53:49,350
your hands in your pockets and ride beside
me for as long as it pleased you.'

3793
04:53:49,350 --> 04:53:52,620
'I'd do that now if you'd take me south.'

3794
04:53:52,620 --> 04:54:01,530
'Yes, but I'm going north - and you're not
a man, you're only a woman, as you'd learn

3795
04:54:01,530 --> 04:54:03,990
if you came with me.

3796
04:54:03,990 --> 04:54:08,200
I'm going now.

3797
04:54:08,200 --> 04:54:09,600
Goodbye.'

3798
04:54:09,600 --> 04:54:15,520
He took her face in his hands and kissed it,
and she saw that he was laughing.

3799
04:54:15,520 --> 04:54:23,078
'When you're an old woman down in Helford,
you'll remember that, and it will have to

3800
04:54:23,078 --> 04:54:26,968
last you to the end of your days.

3801
04:54:26,968 --> 04:54:34,760
"He stole horses," you'll say to yourself,
"and he didn't care for women; but if I had

3802
04:54:34,760 --> 04:54:40,390
not been so proud I'd have been with him now."'

3803
04:54:40,390 --> 04:54:45,398
He climbed onto the cart and looked down at
her, waving his whip.

3804
04:54:45,398 --> 04:54:54,068
'I'll do 50 miles before tonight,' he said,
'and sleep like a child at the end of it,

3805
04:54:54,068 --> 04:54:56,540
in a tent by the side of the road.

3806
04:54:56,540 --> 04:55:02,048
I'll light a fire, and cook some eggs for
my supper.

3807
04:55:02,048 --> 04:55:06,360
Will you think of me or not?'

3808
04:55:06,360 --> 04:55:14,318
But she did not listen; she stood with her
face towards the south, twisting her hands

3809
04:55:14,318 --> 04:55:15,828
and saying nothing.

3810
04:55:15,828 --> 04:55:23,200
Beyond those hills, the empty moors turned
to green grass, and the green grass to valleys

3811
04:55:23,200 --> 04:55:24,860
and to streams.

3812
04:55:24,860 --> 04:55:30,998
The peace and quiet of Helford waited for
her beside the running water.

3813
04:55:30,998 --> 04:55:38,638
'It's not pride,' she told him; 'you know
it's not pride; there's a sickness in my heart

3814
04:55:38,638 --> 04:55:43,600
for home and all the things I've lost.'

3815
04:55:43,600 --> 04:55:47,430
He said nothing, but whistled to the horse.

3816
04:55:47,430 --> 04:55:54,878
'Wait,' said Mary, 'wait, and hold him still,
and give me your hand.'

3817
04:55:54,878 --> 04:56:01,780
He laid the whip to one side, and reached
down to her, and swung her up beside him on

3818
04:56:01,780 --> 04:56:03,748
the driver's seat.

3819
04:56:03,748 --> 04:56:07,638
'What now?' he said.

3820
04:56:07,638 --> 04:56:09,959
'And where do you want me to take you?

3821
04:56:09,959 --> 04:56:15,770
You have your back to Helford, do you know
that?'

3822
04:56:15,770 --> 04:56:21,128
'Yes, I know,' she said.

3823
04:56:21,128 --> 04:56:29,600
'If you come with me it will be a hard life,
and a wild one at times, Mary, with no staying

3824
04:56:29,600 --> 04:56:33,760
anywhere, and little rest or comfort.

3825
04:56:33,760 --> 04:56:40,620
You'll get a poor exchange for your farm and
little hope of the peace you look for.'

3826
04:56:40,620 --> 04:56:44,068
'I'll take the risk, Jem.'

3827
04:56:44,068 --> 04:56:47,150
'Do you love me, Mary?'

3828
04:56:47,150 --> 04:56:49,958
'I believe so, Jem.'

3829
04:56:49,958 --> 04:56:52,068
'Better than Helford?'

3830
04:56:52,068 --> 04:56:55,578
'I can't ever answer that.'

3831
04:56:55,578 --> 04:56:59,388
'Why are you sitting here beside me, then?'

3832
04:56:59,388 --> 04:57:11,860
'Because I want to, because I must; because
now and forever this is where I want to be,'

3833
04:57:11,860 --> 04:57:14,190
said Mary.

3834
04:57:14,190 --> 04:57:21,048
He laughed then, and took her hand, and whipped
the horse; and she did not look back over

3835
04:57:21,048 --> 04:57:25,640
her shoulder again, but set her face north
towards the river.

3836
04:57:25,640 --> 04:57:25,740
- THE END -
