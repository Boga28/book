00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:20,480
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:34,600
A strange meeting
I was walking home from my office one January

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,890
evening.

4
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,239
It was a Monday.

5
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:46,040
The weather was very cold, and there were
some low clouds around the tops of the buildings.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,399
Once I'd left the main road, there weren't
many people in the dark, narrow streets of

7
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,170
Budapest's Thirteenth District.

8
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,860
Everything was very quiet.

9
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,830
It felt as if the city was waiting for something.

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,540
As I walked I thought about what had happened
at work.

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,400
I had argued with one of the Hungarians I
worked with.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
It was the first serious problem since I'd
arrived.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,230
I was trying to think what to do about it,
and I was also hoping that my wife, Andrea,

14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,340
had made one of her nice hot soups for dinner.

15
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,880
After about five minutes it started to snow
heavily, so that the streets were soon completely

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,330
white.

17
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,189
As I was walking along a very dark part of
one street there was the noise of a door shutting

18
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,700
loudly inside a building.

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,090
Then I heard the sound of someone running.

20
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,220
Suddenly, the street door opened and a man
came out of it and ran straight into me.

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:05,800
I fell over into the snow, shouting something
like, 'Hey, watch where you're going!'

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,319
- my words were loud in the empty street.

23
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,720
The man turned to look at me for a moment.

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:21,569
'Sorry,' he said very quietly, in Hungarian,
before walking quickly away.

25
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:31,650
What I saw at that moment, in that dark winter
street was very strange, and I felt very afraid.

26
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,659
Because what I saw was me.

27
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,890
My face looking down at me.

28
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,489
My mouth saying sorry.

29
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,489
CHAPTER TWO
Getting to know me

30
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:57,560
Perhaps I'd better tell you something about
me before I go on with the rest of this story.

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,480
My name is John Taylor, and I'm 34 years old.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,079
I'm nearly two metres tall, with light brown
hair and eyes and I have a moustache.

33
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm a computer programmer.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,699
Four years ago, my company in Bristol became
part of a very large multinational computer

35
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:26,459
company - you would know the name if I told
you.

36
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,519
I was offered the chance to go and work in
their Budapest office.

37
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,949
They needed someone to lead a young Hungarian
team in an important new piece of work.

38
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,909
I was very pleased.

39
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:44,599
It was a better job in the company, and I
thought it would be really interesting to

40
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,870
work in another country, one I'd never visited.

41
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,409
Like many British people, I thought I knew
three things about Hungary: the Danube cuts

42
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:04,069
the capital into two halves, Buda and Pest;
the Hungarian football team had once beaten

43
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,749
England 6 - 3 in London, and people eat hot
goulash all the time.

44
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,290
There was a lot to learn!

45
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,949
And I learnt quickly.

46
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:23,280
The company sent me to Hungarian language
classes at a special school.

47
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,740
Hungarian is very different from English.

48
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,360
I had one-to-one lessons with a pretty teacher
called Andrea.

49
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:40,210
She was a lovely young woman, with dark brown
hair, blue eyes and a beautiful smile, and

50
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,530
she seemed to understand me very well.

51
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:53,470
Our lessons soon became lessons outside class
hours, and slowly we fell in love.

52
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,690
Eighteen months later we got married.

53
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:05,449
Each day of the week I walk to work and back
from our flat in the Thirteenth District.

54
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:13,810
I work in a new office on Vaci urca, and it
takes me about thirty minutes to get there.

55
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,210
My usual working day is half past eight in
the morning to six in the evening.

56
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,460
I generally enjoy my work.

57
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,550
The offices are light and modern, and I like
the people I work with.

58
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,650
Andrea works at different times during the
day, teaching Hungarian to foreigners in a

59
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,849
number of schools and companies.

60
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,319
She also teaches some students at home.

61
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,080
We live on the Pest side of the city, not
far from the Danube.

62
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,370
The old part of the Thirteenth District where
we live is an area of narrow streets full

63
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,130
of small shops, bars and restaurants.

64
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,200
It still feels like an old city.

65
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:11,800
And it was in one of these streets that I
met myself.

66
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,789
CHAPTER THREE
A search

67
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,499
Now I'll continue my story.

68
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:28,610
I lay there in the snow for a few moments,
trying to understand what had just happened.

69
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,330
My first thought was, 'Where has the man gone?'

70
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,139
I looked along the street, and was just in
time to see him turning right at the next

71
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,560
corner.

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,159
I got up immediately, brushed the snow off
my clothes and ran after him.

73
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:53,210
He crossed the road and went into another
street.

74
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,879
When I got to the corner I saw him going into
a doorway.

75
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,979
I walked quickly along the empty street, and
found it was the entrance to a wine cellar.

76
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:12,069
It was under a block of flats, and you had
to go down some steps to get in.

77
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:21,960
It was one of those Budapest places where
working men meet to drink, talk and smoke.

78
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,949
I looked down the steps.

79
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,629
There was the low noise of conversation and
a smell of wine and cigarettes coming up to

80
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,279
meet me.

81
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:39,229
I stood in the snow for a moment, deciding
what to do and looking around me.

82
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:46,180
I had a strange feeling about going down into
the wine cellar.

83
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,939
I wasn't sure who I'd find there.

84
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:59,009
I looked at my footprints - the dark marks
my feet had made in the new snow.

85
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,669
My footprints...

86
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:05,669
But only my footprints!

87
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,850
Where were his?

88
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,909
I looked back along the street.

89
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:18,990
There were only my footprints.

90
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:28,189
My mind was running round and round in circles
trying to understand what was happening.

91
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,130
I stepped down into the wine cellar.

92
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:37,469
It was the first time I had been into that
kind of bar.

93
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:44,370
Inside, it was suddenly warm after the winter
streets.

94
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:51,720
It was dark, and my eyes took a few moments
to get used to the darkness.

95
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,440
I looked around me - there were a few men
dressed in working clothes, standing in small

96
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,050
groups, drinking their wine and talking.

97
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:10,930
I looked over to the bar where I expected
to see my man buying a drink.

98
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,320
But there was just a young man with fair hair
talking to the barman.

99
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:26,899
The place was not very big, and I walked around
and looked at everyone carefully.

100
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,320
My man was nowhere to be seen.

101
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,699
I walked over to the bar.

102
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,780
'Where did the man go?'

103
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,810
I asked the barman.

104
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,250
'What man?' he asked back.

105
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:52,480
'Just before I came in,' I said, 'there was
another man who came in.

106
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,630
Where is he?'

107
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:01,529
The barman looked at the blond man with a
look on his face that seemed to say, 'Who's

108
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,070
this mad man?'

109
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,140
I realised that I sounded strange.

110
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,990
'I'm sorry,' I started again.

111
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,760
'I'm looking for a friend - I thought he had
just come here.

112
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
That's why I came in.

113
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,880
Are you sure nobody came in just before me?'

114
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:31,630
'See for yourself,' said the barman, showing
me the men in the room.

115
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,380
'But is there no other room here?'

116
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,010
I asked.

117
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:43,260
'Only the toilet,' said the barman, looking
at the corner.

118
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,959
I went over and opened the door.

119
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,110
It was cold and dirty.

120
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,000
And empty.

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,380
I didn't know what to do.

122
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,390
I decided to stay and see what happened.

123
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:09,210
'A glass of dry red wine, please,' I said
to the barman when I got back to the bar.

124
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,300
He gave it to me.

125
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,450
I paid, and then I moved over to an empty
place.

126
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,060
There were no chairs, so I stood up against
a high narrow table.

127
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,279
A television was on in the corner of the room.

128
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:33,320
I watched the news and waited.

129
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,230
Andrea didn't know where I was.

130
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,370
Nobody came in or went out.

131
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,740
I drank another glass of wine.

132
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,009
After an hour, I left.

133
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:54,899
I didn't understand anything, and it was not
just because I had drunk too much wine on

134
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,550
an empty stomach.

135
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:06,500
'You smell of wine and smoke!' said Andrea,
as I was standing by the front door, taking

136
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,480
off my coat and boots.

137
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
'What have you been doing?'

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,740
'Oh, I just went for a drink with Peter,'
I said.

139
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,339
'We argued at work today, and I wanted to
talk about it because there is an important

140
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,160
meeting tomorrow.'

141
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,420
Don't think badly of me - I usually tell my
wife the truth!

142
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:40,639
It was just that as I walked home, I had decided
it would be better not to say anything about

143
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,339
what had happened.

144
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,009
When I thought about it, it all sounded so
stupid.

145
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,290
Someone ran out of a building and knocked
me down into the snow.

146
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,930
When he turned back to say sorry, I saw that
he looked just like me.

147
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,980
And then when I followed him he left no footprints.

148
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,890
And he wasn't in the wine cellar I saw him
go into.

149
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,130
It really was all too stupid.

150
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:25,490
So I told her the story about Peter and kept
the truth - if it was the truth - to myself.

151
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,709
By now, I wasn't sure if I really had seen
someone who looked the same as me!

152
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:38,320
But when I went into the bathroom to wash
before dinner, and I looked at my face in

153
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,300
the mirror, I knew that I was right.

154
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:54,170
It wasn't just someone who looked a bit like
me, it was me that I'd seen.

155
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,519
That night, in bed, I couldn't sleep.

156
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,889
I kept thinking about what had happened over
and over again.

157
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,180
Andrea knew something was not right.

158
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,779
She moved across the bed and put her arm around
me.

159
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,529
'What is it, love?'

160
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,460
she asked quietly.

161
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,329
'Oh, nothing,' I replied.

162
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:26,350
'Just those problems at work again.

163
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,290
Don't worry.'

164
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,040
And I kissed her.

165
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,690
Until I met myself, I had always thought myself
to be a normal, intelligent person.

166
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:47,779
I thought I understood more or less how the
world around me worked, even my new world

167
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,730
in Budapest.

168
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:58,050
But what happened that night in the street
had changed something inside me, and I couldn't

169
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,290
get it out of my mind.

170
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:11,430
I kept seeing myself on the ground in that
dark, snowy street, looking up at myself.

171
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:18,800
I felt terribly afraid.

172
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,060
CHAPTER FOUR
7 Felka utca

173
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:33,139
As I walked to work the next day - Tuesday
- I planned my evening.

174
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,790
I had decided that last night the man had
come out of the building at about five to

175
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,130
seven.

176
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,290
I had just been in time to see the start of
the seven o'clock news on television in the

177
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:55,110
wine bar, and only a few minutes had passed
between him knocking me over and the news.

178
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,360
I wanted to go back there that evening at
the same time.

179
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
The day seemed to take a long time to pass.

180
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:12,650
At work, I had the meeting with Peter to talk
about the difficulty of the day before.

181
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:18,560
We talked about our problems and came to a
friendly agreement.

182
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,930
I had lunch in the office restaurant as usual,
but didn't say more than a few words to anyone.

183
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:33,290
In fact, during the day, two or three people
asked me if I was feeling ill.

184
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:40,930
I said that I was fine, just thinking about
a difficult work problem.

185
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:46,040
That evening I left the office at six o'clock.

186
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,819
I walked quickly to the street where I had
first seen the man.

187
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:57,399
Soon I found the door; it was number 7 Felka
utca.

188
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:03,850
While I waited, I looked at the street carefully.

189
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:11,340
It was short and dark, and there was still
a lot of snow around from yesterday.

190
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:17,120
On either side of the street were blocks of
flats which had been built in the late nineteenth

191
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,700
and early twentieth centuries.

192
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,250
Most of them were dirty and in bad condition.

193
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:31,150
On many of them you could still see the holes
the gunshots had made during the fighting

194
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,570
in World War II or the 1956 revolution.

195
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,580
The blocks were all five floors high with
big front doors.

196
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:49,870
At this time on a winter evening only one
or two kitchen windows were lit as people

197
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,790
made their evening meals.

198
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,950
I waited, walking slowly up and down.

199
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,440
It was cold.

200
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,910
I felt a bit like a private detective in an
American film.

201
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:12,480
A few people walked along the street, but
mainly it was as quiet as it had been the

202
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,020
night before.

203
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:22,290
As the time got near, I stood opposite the
entrance to number 7 with the wall behind

204
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,340
my back.

205
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,170
Nothing happened.

206
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,880
At seven o'clock, a woman with a small dog
came along the street and went in through

207
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,240
the door, but then there was nothing to see.

208
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,080
And there was certainly nobody like myself
there.

209
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,930
I went over to the door of number 7, and looked
at the names beside the bells for each flat.

210
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,540
I don't know what I expected to find.

211
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,450
But there were just the usual Hungarian family
names, and a couple of small companies that

212
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:09,090
had offices on the ground floor of the building.

213
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,420
Then I walked to the bar where I'd gone the
night before.

214
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:20,840
I walked along Felka utca, crossed the road
and went into Gergely utca.

215
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,030
I found the bar, and went down the steps and
into the smoky room.

216
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,350
I ordered a red wine.

217
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,590
The barman looked at me.

218
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,880
'Did you find your friend, then?' he asked
I was surprised.

219
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,010
'I'm sorry?'

220
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,470
I replied, coughing into my wine.

221
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,150
'The man you were looking for last night,'
he said.

222
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,120
'Did you find him?'

223
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,250
'No, I'm afraid I didn't,' I answered.

224
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,350
'That's why I'm here, really.

225
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,250
I was hoping I might see him tonight.'

226
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:10,350
'What's he like then, this friend of yours?'
asked the barman.

227
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,380
'Well, he's... er... he's...'

228
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,550
I stopped.

229
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,900
The barman looked at me, waiting.

230
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,430
'He looks very much like me, actually.'

231
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:32,290
'I can't say that I've seen anyone like you
here,' he said.

232
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:39,770
'But then I only bought the place six weeks
ago, so I don't really know everyone who comes

233
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,920
in here yet.

234
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,520
Just the usual people who are in here now.'

235
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:54,090
A man came up to the bar, and I moved away,
watching the end of the news on the television

236
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,520
and drinking my wine.

237
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,820
I looked at the people in the room - they
all looked just like those I'd seen the night

238
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,240
before.

239
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,060
But there was no - one like me.

240
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,520
I decided to leave.

241
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,740
When I got home I was pleased to find a note
from Andrea on the kitchen table.

242
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,340
It said that she was out teaching a new student
- so I didn't have to make up any more stories

243
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,410
about where I'd been.

244
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:36,130
That night I had a strange dream.

245
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,960
In my dream, I heard the noise of a door shutting
loudly.

246
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,860
I was running out of a building and I ran
into someone.

247
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,780
A man.

248
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,750
He fell down.

249
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,700
I turned to say sorry.

250
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,090
I saw that it was me lying on the ground.

251
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:09,130
I woke up feeling afraid and cold in the dark,
although the bedroom was nice and warm.

252
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,770
The strange thing was that it was as if the
dream had changed everything round: because

253
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:22,750
in the dream it was me who ran out of the
building, not the man, and when I looked at

254
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:28,810
the man on the ground it was myself.

255
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,860
Suddenly, Andrea woke up.

256
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,240
'What's the matter, love?'

257
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,950
she asked sleepily, turning on the light.

258
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,870
I couldn't speak at first.

259
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,900
She sat up and looked at me.

260
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,370
'You look bad,' she said.

261
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,310
She sounded worried.

262
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:56,390
'Do you feel ill?'

263
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,720
'No,' I started.

264
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,770
'No.

265
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:05,260
It was... just... just a dream.'

266
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:13,230
'Poor darling,' she said, holding my head
and kissing me on the cheek.

267
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,300
'Come on, let's try and get some sleep.'

268
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,400
I lay down again.

269
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,130
She turned off the light and soon went back
to sleep.

270
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:34,450
But I lay there in bed, looking at the four
walls in the dark, watching the dream over

271
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,490
and over again in the cinema inside my head.

272
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:52,390
I felt afraid, but I didn't really understand
what it was that I was afraid of.

273
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:59,720
CHAPTER FIVE
I tell Andrea

274
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,800
And so my new life began.

275
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:11,480
Every day that week I went to work, every
night I waited outside the house at number

276
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:18,080
7 Felka utca, and then I spent time in the
bar.

277
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:26,800
And every night I had the same dream and woke
up feeling afraid in the dark.

278
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,230
And if I went back to sleep, I had the dream
again.

279
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:40,210
And if I didn't go back to sleep, I lay in
bed in the dark trying to understand what

280
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,670
was happening to me.

281
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:53,020
And every morning I was more and more tired,
and I wasn't nice to Andrea.

282
00:24:53,020 --> 00:25:00,170
I felt terrible because of the dreams and
because I was so tired.

283
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:08,070
And I felt worse because Andrea didn't know
why I was arriving late every evening, and

284
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,450
I didn't tell her the truth.

285
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,780
Things at work became difficult.

286
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,500
I couldn't think about the important things
I had to do.

287
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:28,270
And even worse, the next day I argued with
Andrea.

288
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:35,610
She couldn't understand why I had to go to
the Gergely utca bar every night, and of course

289
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,850
I felt I couldn't tell her.

290
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:45,310
And then because I didn't feel good, I started
drinking more than the two glasses of wine

291
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:50,090
I had had the first two nights.

292
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:57,770
I started staying in the bar much longer because
I was afraid to go home and try to sleep.

293
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,580
I was afraid to dream the same dream.

294
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:10,970
On Thursday, when I came home very late after
drinking too much, Andrea had already gone

295
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,340
to bed.

296
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:24,920
On Friday, I was late home again, but when
I got in Andrea was waiting up for me.

297
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,490
She looked very unhappy.

298
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,350
Her face was white and her pretty blue eyes
were red.

299
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,780
She had been crying.

300
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:49,310
'John,' she said, as I got some bread and
cheese to eat, 'what is the matter?'

301
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,470
I said nothing as I ate.

302
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,710
'John,' she tried again, 'you must tell me
what happened.

303
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,140
You've changed completely.

304
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,030
Please... talk to me.'

305
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:17,280
I looked up at her, this wonderful woman I
loved so much, and saw how much I was hurting

306
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,110
her.

307
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:26,740
I felt so terrible that I started crying.

308
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:35,440
She put her arms around me and talked to me
quietly, as if I were a little child.

309
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,930
Then she took my face between her hands.

310
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:44,470
'Tell me, darling,' she said quietly.

311
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:51,110
'I want to help you.'

312
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,420
And so I told her everything.

313
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:03,860
The words came out quickly, and when I'd finished
she suddenly laughed and laughed.

314
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,790
'It's not funny,' I said angrily.

315
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,540
'No, darling,' she answered.

316
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:20,390
'It's not funny at all, but I feel so happy.'

317
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:25,240
She stopped laughing, and continued in a serious
voice.

318
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,760
'You see, I thought you'd found somebody else.

319
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,690
Another woman.'

320
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:41,800
After that we held each other and kissed for
a very long time.

321
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,520
Then she made me tell her the story again,
very slowly.

322
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,610
She kept asking questions, trying to get all
the information about every part of it.

323
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,410
'Right,' she said.

324
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:02,900
'Tomorrow is Saturday, and neither of us is
working.

325
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:09,450
We'll go round to number 7 Felka utca and
start asking some questions.

326
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,380
I'm sure there's a very easy answer to this
story.'

327
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,040
I felt so happy.

328
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:30,030
She was so sweet and good and I was sure that
everything was going to be all right.

329
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:36,900
CHAPTER SIX
Talking to the housekeepers

330
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,860
The next day was very sunny, though still
very cold.

331
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:49,150
The strong sunshine made me feel more hopeful
about the future, now that I had told Andrea

332
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,150
about what had happened.

333
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:58,840
I finally felt good after an excellent night's
sleep - it was the first time I hadn't dreamt

334
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,900
about meeting myself for nearly a week.

335
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,650
At ten o'clock we walked round to Felka utca.

336
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:16,331
I was really pleased that Andrea was with
me; although my Hungarian was good, she would

337
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:22,070
be able to talk to people much more easily
than me.

338
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,960
The first person we spoke to was the housekeeper
- the lady who had the small ground-floor

339
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,360
flat near the door in return for doing jobs
in the building, such as cleaning the stairs

340
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,530
and checking the lift and the lights.

341
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,160
We asked her a lot of questions.

342
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,450
When we asked if there was anybody who looked
like me living in the flats she looked at

343
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:53,210
me for a long time, and then said there wasn't.

344
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:00,230
Andrea next asked her how long she'd worked
there; the answer was twenty-one years.

345
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,470
And did she know everybody?

346
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,320
She did.

347
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,060
And were there any new families?

348
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,360
There weren't.

349
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,910
And were there any men looking like me who'd
lived here and then moved away lately?

350
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,510
There weren't.

351
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,670
We thanked her, and left.

352
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,770
Out in the street, we looked at each other.

353
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,390
I was starting to think I must be imagining
everything.

354
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:40,310
'Perhaps it was a visitor,' said Andrea, realising
how bad I felt.

355
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:48,360
'Or perhaps,' I said, 'perhaps he lives in
the other building, where the bar is, and

356
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,070
I didn't see where he went.'

357
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,360
'Maybe,' said Andrea.

358
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,260
'Let's go and try.'

359
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,900
We walked round to Gergely utca and stopped
outside the bar.

360
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:12,270
'So,' she said, looking down the steps to
the cellar, 'this is where you've been spending

361
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,830
your evenings!'

362
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,130
My face went red.

363
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,080
'Sorry,' I said.

364
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,980
'I'm joking, love!'

365
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,490
she said laughing.

366
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:32,250
'Look - the main entrance to the block of
flats is next door.

367
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:38,850
It would have been easy for you to mistake
which one he went into in the dark and snow.'

368
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:44,230
'Yes, you're right,' I answered.

369
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:52,540
But I kept thinking about the fact that there
had been no footprints in the snow.

370
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,960
Inside the building we met another housekeeper.

371
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,630
This time it was a man in his fifties who'd
worked there for twelve years.

372
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:09,850
We asked the same questions as we had asked
before, and got the same answers.

373
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,960
He'd never seen anyone there who looked like
me.

374
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,190
I felt very bad after these second answers.

375
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:26,620
I thought that Andrea would think there was
something wrong with me.

376
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,520
Andrea took my hand.

377
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,290
'Come on,' she said, laughing.

378
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:37,830
'Let's go and have a drink in your famous
bar!'

379
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,740
I was so surprised that I didn't have time
to say anything as I followed her down the

380
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,890
steps.

381
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:51,780
The barman welcomed me with a friendly smile
and a joke about good friends bringing more

382
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,330
friends.

383
00:33:53,330 --> 00:34:00,490
I introduced him to Andrea, then we took our
wine and stood in a corner and talked about

384
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,080
what had happened.

385
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,649
'There is one important thing about all of
this, Andrea,' I said when we seemed to have

386
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,790
talked about it all.

387
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:22,159
'And I know it sounds very strange, but I
don't think this person just looked like me.

388
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,849
I think it was me.'

389
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:32,710
I'd said this to her before when I'd told
her the first time, and she'd laughed and

390
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,609
said it was impossible.

391
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:40,139
But I had a feeling deep inside me that I
was right.

392
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:46,149
'But, John,' she asked, 'how could that be?'

393
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:50,829
'I don't know, love,' I replied.

394
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:54,289
'I just feel it.

395
00:34:54,289 --> 00:35:02,230
So perhaps we shouldn't be looking for someone
who, lives in these buildings now.

396
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:12,099
Perhaps we should be looking for someone who,
well... er... someone who's dead.

397
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,940
And who I am, now.

398
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,400
Andrea looked at me very hard.

399
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:28,569
'John,' she said, 'I've never heard you say
anything like this before.

400
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:30,640
What do you mean?'

401
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,750
'I wish I knew what I meant,' I said with
difficulty.

402
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:44,619
'All I know is that I have a strange idea
inside my head that tells me these things

403
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:49,009
are possible.'

404
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:54,259
We finished our drink without speaking and
left.

405
00:35:54,259 --> 00:36:02,320
'Andrea,' I said as we walked home, 'you must
believe me.

406
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,420
I need your help to try and understand what's
happened to me.'

407
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,970
'I'm trying to believe you, love,' she answered,
turning to look at me.

408
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:22,450
'It's just that it's very difficult to understand.'

409
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:30,500
'It's difficult for me, too,' I said.

410
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,740
CHAPTER SEVEN
Doppelganger

411
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:43,150
After that Saturday my life returned to what
it had been, in one way.

412
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:50,970
I went back to work on Monday and I was my
old self, and things went well.

413
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,930
I didn't have the dreams at night any more.

414
00:36:54,930 --> 00:37:01,089
And I didn't visit Felka utca and the bar
every night either, although I still went

415
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:05,269
in once or twice a week.

416
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:09,460
But there were also big changes.

417
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:16,640
The next Wednesday Andrea came home from a
visit to the doctor's with big news: she was

418
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,339
expecting a baby!

419
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,420
We were extremely happy.

420
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,970
We had often talked about starting a family,
but hadn't thought it would happen quite so

421
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,230
soon.

422
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:38,940
And then the day after that she lost her biggest
teaching job - fifteen hours a week with an

423
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,819
international bank.

424
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:47,769
They didn't want to pay for Hungarian lessons
for the people who worked there anymore.

425
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,960
The ups and downs of life!

426
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:59,440
A week or so later I told Zsolt - the wine
cellar barman - that Andrea had lost her most

427
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,250
important job.

428
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,819
He said he was looking for someone to help
him in the bar.

429
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:13,730
He said it wasn't a job for an 'intelligent
lady' like my wife, but he also said he could

430
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:22,210
offer her good money, and he felt the place
needed a woman's touch to make it better.

431
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:29,049
I talked about the offer with Andrea, and
in the end she took the job.

432
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:35,609
The pay wasn't as good as for teaching, but
the bar was very close to home.

433
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:43,250
Also, she didn't have to spend hours working
on her lessons like she did for teaching.

434
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,900
And she soon made quite a difference to the
bar.

435
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:54,599
When I went in the week after she'd started
it looked much better - there were flowers

436
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,049
on the bar, and pictures on the walls.

437
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:04,549
'I've asked Zsolt if we can make one side
of the bar into a sitting area with tables

438
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:12,049
and chairs,' Andrea told me over dinner one
evening, 'and he's agreed.'

439
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,299
'Why do you want to do that?'

440
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:16,160
I asked.

441
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,430
'Well, I thought more people might want to
come in,' she said.

442
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,319
'And women might like it, too.'

443
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:28,839
And she was right.

444
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:33,630
Soon after that women started going to the
bar as well as men.

445
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,230
Zsolt was very pleased.

446
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:45,420
However, between all these new things in our
life, I didn't forget my strange meeting with

447
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,220
'myself'.

448
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,200
I started doing lots of reading about life
after death.

449
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,500
It was a completely new thing for me, and
I found it very interesting.

450
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,460
I learnt many things I didn't know.

451
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:09,849
Perhaps the most interesting thing I found
out was that what had happened to me has a

452
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,309
name:

453
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:17,670
DOPPELGANGER: A German word which is used
in English.

454
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:25,190
It means something like 'double-walker' or
'doublegoer' - a ghostly double of a living

455
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:31,160
person, who comes to give messages about danger
or to offer advice.

456
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:40,119
It can only be seen by its owner (This was
why there were no footprints, and why Zsolt

457
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,089
had seen nothing in the bar, I thought.)

458
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:51,940
However, it can sometimes be seen by somebody
close if it has an important message.

459
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:58,130
It is usually thought to bring bad luck, and
is often believed to show that there will

460
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:05,809
soon be a serious problem or a death.

461
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:09,380
I showed Andrea the page from the book I was
reading.

462
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:15,029
'And so is this what you think you saw?'

463
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,259
she asked looking surprised.

464
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:22,430
'Well, it sounds like it, doesn't it?'

465
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,020
I answered.

466
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:32,140
So now I knew - I had met my doppelganger.

467
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:40,410
The next question was why?

468
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:46,309
CHAPTER EIGHT
A holiday

469
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:50,999
In August Andrea gave up working for Zsolt.

470
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:57,339
We spent my summer holiday happily painting
a small room in our flat so that it was ready

471
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:05,839
for the baby, and on 16 September our daughter
was born.

472
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,240
We gave her the name Kati.

473
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,010
After that, things changed even more as we
got used to all the differences a new baby

474
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,400
makes to her parents' lives.

475
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,319
It was hard work, but we were very happy.

476
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:33,900
And I was so busy that for a while I forgot
about what had happened in Felka utca.

477
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,730
We decided to go to England at Christmas.

478
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:44,960
We wanted my parents and family to meet Kati,
and this was a good chance.

479
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,260
We soon learnt how difficult it is to go on
holiday with a small baby.

480
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,670
You need to take so many things!

481
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:59,470
It took us a very long time to get ready.

482
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:06,589
We flew from Budapest to London Heathrow on
22 December.

483
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:12,950
My parents met us and drove us to their house
in a village near Swindon, about an hour from

484
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,749
the airport.

485
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:19,119
Everyone was very happy.

486
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,499
It was only the third time that Andrea had
visited my parents' place, and only her second

487
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:28,400
English Christmas.

488
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,109
And this time we had a new baby in the Family
with us.

489
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:40,470
Of course, Kati was the centre of everyone's
attention.

490
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:46,890
The next day, my mother said she would look
after Kati so that Andrea and I could go into

491
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:51,109
Swindon to do some Christmas shopping.

492
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:56,559
The town was very colourful, with lights and
Christmas trees everywhere.

493
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:05,369
And it was very busy, with all the shops full
of people buying Christmas presents.

494
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:11,200
We enjoyed ourselves, and got some more presents
to add to the special Hungarian Christmas

495
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,309
things we had brought with us.

496
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:22,680
That evening, my father was out at his office
Christmas dinner and Andrea was tired after

497
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:30,430
our day in town, so I decided to go down to
the village pub and see if any of my old friends

498
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,930
were there.

499
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:39,460
I saw one or two neighbours and talked to
them for, a while, but none of my good friends

500
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,930
were there.

501
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:47,289
I was just going to leave when in walked Paul
Harris.

502
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:53,630
Paul had been one of my closest friends at
school, but he hadn't been in the village

503
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,859
the last few times I'd visited my parents.

504
00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:03,960
He was a journalist and had lived in many
different places since we'd left school.

505
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,680
'Paul!'

506
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,509
I called, as he walked into the bar.

507
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:12,049
'John!' he said.

508
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:14,800
'How good to see you!'

509
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,990
'Good to see you, too,' I replied.

510
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,009
'I was just leaving.

511
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:24,319
None of our old friends are here.'

512
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,740
'No,' he said sadly.

513
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:34,779
'Most of them have left - gone to other places
for work or wives!'

514
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:37,359
'What would you like to drink?'

515
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,859
I asked.

516
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:45,789
'I'll have a pint of bitter, please, John,'
he replied.

517
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:53,540
We took our beer to a quiet corner of the
pub and started to tell each other our news.

518
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,849
'Just back to have Christmas with the family,'
he explained.

519
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:00,109
'On your own?'

520
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:05,499
I said, asking myself what had happened to
his wife, Liz.

521
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:11,619
'I'm afraid so,' he said, looking down at
his beer.

522
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,730
'Liz left me last summer.'

523
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,940
'I'm sorry, Paul,' I replied.

524
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,550
'I had no idea...'

525
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,619
'Don't worry,' he said.

526
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,650
'The worst part is over.

527
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,420
So tell me about you.

528
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:35,700
My mother told me there's a baby now.'

529
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,990
And so I told him all about Kati, and Andrea,
and life in Budapest.

530
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:48,590
And after a couple more beers I told him about
meeting myself.

531
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:57,079
Paul was one of my oldest and best friends,
and I knew he would take the story seriously.

532
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:03,599
'That's very interesting, John,' he said when
I'd finished.

533
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,660
He didn't laugh or tell me I was stupid.

534
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,510
He seemed to be thinking about something.

535
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:18,610
'There was a story about the same thing - doppelgangers,
and people meeting themselves - in one of

536
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:22,400
the magazines I write for.'

537
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,569
'Did you read it?'

538
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:27,859
I asked, hoping he might have some more information.

539
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:32,160
'Only the first part,' he said.

540
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,690
'But I remember it said that this happens
to quite a lot of people everywhere.'

541
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,480
'Well, that's good news,' I replied.

542
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,759
'I thought I was going crazy or something!'

543
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:51,680
'No, John, you're not,' he said, smiling.

544
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,910
'But you should be careful.

545
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:01,239
I remember that it also said that bad things
had happened to many people after seeing a

546
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,450
doppelganger.'

547
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,109
'Yes, I read that, too,' I said.

548
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:08,789
'In a book in Budapest.

549
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:12,680
But anyway, it's good to know I'm not alone.'

550
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:21,499
'Yes, that may help you to feel happier,'
he said seriously.

551
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:27,029
But I remember one story from the magazine
where the Doppelganger was trying to tell

552
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:32,030
a woman not to drive her son to school one
day.

553
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:39,289
She didn't understand and that same day they
had a car accident and her son was killed.'

554
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:42,589
'Oh, really!'

555
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,799
I said, surprised.

556
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:50,650
'So perhaps you should be careful,' said Paul.

557
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,890
'I will, don't worry,' I answered.

558
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:03,069
In one way I felt much happier knowing that
what had happened to me was not so unusual,

559
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:10,300
but I started trying to understand what kind
of message my doppelganger was trying to bring

560
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,779
me.

561
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:20,609
Thinking about it made me feel uncomfortable,
so I tried to forget it and enjoy Christmas.

562
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:25,079
But it wasn't very easy.

563
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,410
The rest of the Christmas holiday in England
passed quickly.

564
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:36,700
We ate lots of nice food, played family games,
visited friends and family' in other places,

565
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,569
and really enjoyed ourselves.

566
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:44,390
Soon it was time to go back to Hungary.

567
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:52,210
We flew back on 29 December, returning to
spend New Year with Andrea's family in the

568
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,549
snowy Hungarian countryside.

569
00:49:56,549 --> 00:50:00,930
Perhaps it was because we couldn't go out
much and there wasn't much to do except sit

570
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:09,359
around the house, but I started thinking about
my doppelganger story more and more.

571
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:15,849
I was trying to decide what the meeting with
myself had meant.

572
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:20,710
Andrea said that I wasn't joining in with
family things much.

573
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:26,400
But when I told her why, she got angry with
me, and we argued.

574
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:33,140
'I thought you'd forgotten about that stupid
story,' she said.

575
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:39,670
'I've tried to, Andrea,' I answered, 'but
it keeps coming back to me.'

576
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,670
'Well, it had better go away from you very
quickly!'

577
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:45,869
she answered.

578
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:53,190
'I want a man who looks after his family,
talks to his wife and plays with his daughter.

579
00:50:53,190 --> 00:51:00,099
I don't want someone who sits around the house
all day looking into space.'

580
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:04,779
And she walked out of the room.

581
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:11,270
I understood that Andrea was tired and wanted
me to pay more attention to my family, and

582
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:18,259
I tried to be better, but then two days later
we went home.

583
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:28,010
I went back to work as usual on Monday 5 January.

584
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:35,049
CHAPTER NINE
The date gets closer again

585
00:51:35,049 --> 00:51:42,080
At three 0'clock in the morning on 11 January
I suddenly sat up in bed.

586
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,450
I listened.

587
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:52,089
Kati wasn't crying (in fact, she usually slept
all through the night by then).

588
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:56,510
But I was cold and afraid in the dark.

589
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,799
Suddenly, I realised what had happened.

590
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:04,880
I had the dream again.

591
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,569
The street.

592
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:07,660
The door.

593
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,529
Me running out.

594
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:12,369
The man on the ground.

595
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:14,349
Me.

596
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:17,680
Meeting myself.

597
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,329
I felt terrible.

598
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:26,739
Since little Kati had entered my life, I hadn't
had the bad dreams.

599
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:34,369
I thought they were a thing of the past, but
here they were again, as big and black as

600
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:38,749
before.

601
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:45,150
I couldn't sleep, so I went into the kitchen
and made myself some tea.

602
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:51,400
Then I went to the bookshelf in the living
room and took down last year's diary.

603
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:59,619
You see, I always keep a diary where I write
down what happens each day.

604
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:06,079
Monday 18 January was when I'd had the strange
meeting last year.

605
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,119
It was seven days until that date now.

606
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:21,030
Then suddenly, a new idea came into my head:
it was the date that was important!

607
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,220
It all seemed so clear!

608
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:29,589
It was not surprising that I'd never met myself
again on all those evenings I'd waited in

609
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:32,210
Felka utca!

610
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,289
I needed to be there on 18 January.

611
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:39,989
Next Sunday evening.

612
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:45,650
And I'd had the dream again to make me remember!

613
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:52,990
I walked up and down again and again, with
thoughts running quickly through my head.

614
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,670
It was the date that was important.

615
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:02,950
My reading about ghosts and life after death
had helped me to find out about doppelgangers,

616
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:07,619
but I still didn't understand.

617
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:14,990
What I needed to do was to find out what had
happened in Felka utca or Gergely Utca one

618
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:21,890
18 January in the past.

619
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:27,559
The six days which followed that night were
very difficult.

620
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:32,789
The next morning, I told Andrea that I'd had
the dream again.

621
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:41,789
'I think it's the date - 18 January - which
must be important,' I said.

622
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:45,200
Andrea carried on giving Kati her milk.

623
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,049
'I want to do some reading about it,' I went
on.

624
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:57,930
'I'd like to start looking at some old newspapers
to find out what happened there on 18 January.

625
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:03,660
Where can I go to find old newspapers in Budapest?'

626
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,460
Andrea was angry with me.

627
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,680
'Leave it alone, John!'

628
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,830
she shouted.

629
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:13,940
'There are more important things in your life
now!'

630
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,710
'But Andrea...'

631
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,009
I started.

632
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:20,819
'You've got a baby to look after,' she continued.

633
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,500
'And me.

634
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:29,549
You can't use your free time looking for something
you won't be able to find!'

635
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:32,269
Kati started to cry.

636
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:38,579
It seemed that she understood that her mother
and father were unhappy.

637
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:44,630
I decided to tell Andrea everything I was
thinking and doing this time, it had been

638
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,819
no good keeping the truth from her last year.

639
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:57,289
So on Friday 16 January, after having the
dream every night that week, I talked to her

640
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:00,479
about the coming Sunday.

641
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:09,170
'Andrea, I have to go to Felka Utca on Sunday,'
I started.

642
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,980
She said nothing.

643
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,230
'And I'd like you to come with me...'

644
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,279
'You must be joking!'

645
00:56:17,279 --> 00:56:18,279
she said.

646
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:26,130
'But listen, love,' I went on, taking her
hand, 'I need you to come with me.'

647
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:29,220
'How would that help you?'

648
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,950
she asked, taking her hand away.

649
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,930
'There are two reasons,' I continued.

650
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:42,869
'First, because I'm afraid to go by myself,
and second, because I want to know if you

651
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,940
see anything.'

652
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,910
'But how do you know that this man will be
there?'

653
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,269
she asked.

654
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:54,080
'I don't,' I replied.

655
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:02,210
'But it's the only idea I have about what
happened - that it's the date which is important.'

656
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,519
Andrea said nothing.

657
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:06,319
I watched her.

658
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,880
'Please, love,' I said.

659
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,039
'It would help me a lot.'

660
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:15,680
'But what about Kati?'

661
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,170
she asked.

662
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,010
'I'm not taking her with me.'

663
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:23,509
'Of course not,' I said, happier.

664
00:57:23,509 --> 00:57:28,660
'We'll get your friend Petra to look after
her.'

665
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,400
She said nothing again.

666
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,150
'Yes?'

667
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,190
I asked, carefully.

668
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,480
She sat thinking for a long time.

669
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,150
I waited.

670
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,739
'All right,' she said.

671
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:50,170
'But this really is the last time.'

672
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,430
'OK,' I said.

673
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,920
'OK.

674
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,400
But...

675
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,380
thank you.'

676
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:05,049
I was very pleased, and went to telephone
Petra at once.

677
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:11,310
Petra was an old friend of Andrea's who sometimes
looked after Kati when we went out.

678
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:16,320
I told her we'd unexpectedly been invited
to tea at my boss's flat.

679
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,400
Luckily, she said yes.

680
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,739
I hoped that I would sleep better knowing
Andrea was coming with me on Sunday.

681
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:27,470
I didn't.

682
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:34,140
I had the dream again and again that night
and on Saturday.

683
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:40,519
The dream was almost the same, except that
I now seemed to hear a loud noise in the street

684
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:44,530
just before the man came out of the door.

685
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,539
I tried to understand what the loud noise
was.

686
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:53,619
I listened in my dream, but it wasn't very
clear.

687
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:59,339
I knew it was something important, something
that would help me, but I couldn't be sure

688
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,019
what it was.

689
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:07,160
I often woke up after the dream and felt afraid.

690
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:13,109
I stayed awake in the dark trying to decide
what the dream was trying to tell me.

691
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:23,019
I also worried about what was going to happen
if I met my doppelganger again on Sunday.

692
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:29,859
CHAPTER TEN
18 January

693
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:32,940
Sunday started very quietly.

694
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,349
We didn't talk much to each other.

695
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:42,750
Both Andrea and I were unsure of what we were
going to do and what might happen.

696
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:48,819
At three o'clock on Sunday afternoon, Petra
arrived to look after Kati.

697
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:52,890
'What's the matter with you two?'

698
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:56,839
she asked, as we put our coats on.

699
00:59:56,839 --> 01:00:03,519
'You look as if you're visiting someone in
hospital rather than going to a tea party!'

700
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:11,119
We tried to smile as we left the house, but
we were both afraid.

701
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:17,140
We had decided to go to for a walk to use
the time before our meeting.

702
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:24,710
We went to Margaret Island - the lovely island
park in the middle of the River Danube.

703
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:32,190
It was a place we always liked going to, with
its huge trees full of singing birds.

704
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:36,559
We often took Kati there to get some fresh
air.

705
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,739
But today, although it was quite a nice winter
afternoon, we were thinking about the meeting

706
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,509
too much to enjoy it.

707
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,529
We didn't speak much.

708
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:55,589
At quarter to six we started to walk back
over the wide grey river and into the streets

709
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:58,069
of the Thirteenth District.

710
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:06,059
By half past six we were standing opposite
number 7 Felka utca.

711
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:10,770
It was evening by now, and the street was
as dark as usual.

712
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:17,930
'Where do you think we should wait?' asked
Andrea.

713
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,950
'You stay on this side of the road,' I answered.

714
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:26,089
'When it's time, I'll go and stand outside
the door.

715
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:29,640
You watch and listen carefully.'

716
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:35,930
At ten to seven I walked across the road.

717
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:42,180
There was nobody around, just Andrea and I.

718
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:49,190
Then suddenly I heard a noise, then an inside
door shut.

719
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:52,259
I looked across at Andrea.

720
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:55,460
I heard the sound of someone running.

721
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,499
The door opened and out ran a man, straight
into me.

722
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:04,380
I fell to the ground, shouting, 'Hey!'

723
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,039
The man looked round.

724
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,530
He had my face.

725
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:17,559
'Sorry,' he said in Hungarian, and went off
quickly to the end of the street.

726
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,900
I stood up.

727
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,240
Andrea was standing there looking at me.

728
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,450
I could see she didn't understand what had
just happened.

729
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,859
'Quick!'

730
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:30,500
I shouted.

731
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,180
'Follow him!'

732
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:39,430
I ran up to the end of the street, and crossed
over into Gergely utca.

733
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:44,250
The man was just going down into the wine
bar.

734
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:47,920
Andrea arrived by my side a moment later.

735
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,500
'There!'

736
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
I shouted.

737
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,619
'Did you see?

738
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:55,130
He went down into the wine cellar.

739
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,930
Come on!'

740
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:03,359
I ran along to Zsolt's bar, pulling Andrea
after me.

741
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,680
I went down the stairs and pushed the door.

742
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,000
It was shut.

743
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:17,329
Of course, it was Sunday afternoon, Zsolt's
afternoon off.

744
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:23,589
I sat down on the steps and looked at the
locked door.

745
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:30,500
Andrea sat beside me and put her arm round
my shoulder.

746
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:37,319
When I looked at her she had a strange look
in her eyes.

747
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:40,990
As we walked home we talked about what had
happened.

748
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:46,559
'It was just the same as last year,' I said.

749
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,000
'Just the same.'

750
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,069
'But I saw nothing and heard nothing.

751
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:59,079
All I saw was you falling over and shouting,'
she said.

752
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:07,920
'And it was very strange - you just fell over.'

753
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,779
We walked the rest of the way home without
speaking.

754
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:17,609
When Petra had left, we didn't talk very much
all evening.

755
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:23,910
For me, everything had been the same as last
year.

756
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:29,569
Except that this time there had been no snow
to show that the man had left no footprints,

757
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:35,799
and the bar he went into had been closed.

758
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:40,650
That night I had the dream again.

759
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,660
I was standing outside the building.

760
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:47,759
I heard the new noise - much louder now.

761
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,960
The door opened.

762
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,989
The man ran out of the door and knocked me
over.

763
01:04:53,989 --> 01:05:01,109
He turned to say sorry, and when I looked
at him it was me I saw.

764
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:09,369
The strange thing was that every time I had
the dream the noise got louder and louder.

765
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:18,890
And I always woke up feeling terribly afraid.

766
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:25,920
CHAPTER ELEVEN
A little bit of history

767
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:32,210
The next Monday there was no important new
work to do for a few days, so I asked my boss

768
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:35,229
for some time off work.

769
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:40,250
I told him Andrea wasn't feeling well and
needed some help at home with the baby in

770
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,999
the afternoons.

771
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:48,569
He kindly said I could go to the office only
in the mornings, for a week or two until the

772
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:53,240
next big piece of work arrived from Britain.

773
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:58,099
I decided not to tell Andrea what I was going
to do.

774
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:02,819
She had been kind enough to come with me to
the meeting that Sunday when she really didn't

775
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:10,819
want to, and I didn't want to make her angry
or worried again.

776
01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:17,799
At two o'clock in the afternoon on Monday
19 January, I was sitting in the reading room

777
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:23,880
of the Budapest City Library with a lot of
big books in front of me.

778
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:30,329
They were not really books, but newspapers
that had been made into books.

779
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:36,079
I wanted to find out everything that had happened
in Budapest's Thirteenth District on every

780
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,630
18 January.

781
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:45,210
I decided to read one of Hungary's best-known
newspapers, because it always had lots of

782
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:49,759
news about what was happening in Budapest.

783
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:54,809
I had asked the librarian for this newspaper
for every month of January, starting from

784
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:59,029
ten years before.

785
01:06:59,029 --> 01:07:04,510
I went through the Budapest pages for each
year very carefully.

786
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:12,319
I studied the days between 12 and 25 January,
as this was the week before and the week after

787
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,920
the date of meeting my doppelganger.

788
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:23,890
Of course, I was always very careful when
I got to each 18 January.

789
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:29,170
It took me longer than I'd expected, and I
was only just able to finish the first ten

790
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:34,280
Januarys before the library closed at five
o'clock.

791
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:42,249
My Hungarian was good, but it still took me
a long time to read the old newspapers.

792
01:07:42,249 --> 01:07:46,000
I went to the reading room each afternoon.

793
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,339
I discovered all sorts of things I never knew
about Budapest.

794
01:07:51,339 --> 01:07:58,250
Much of what I read about from before 1990
was, of course, about the Communist Party.

795
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:03,930
There was-more and more information about
groups of politicians and workers who visited

796
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:10,809
from other Eastern European countries, the
deeper into the past I went.

797
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:16,961
I sometimes found information about the Thirteenth
District, but nothing interesting, and I had

798
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:21,210
found nothing about 'Felka utca.

799
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:26,120
I was beginning to think I would never find
anything, or that my reading would have to

800
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:31,060
go back into the nineteenth century.

801
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:38,310
On Saturday I told Andrea that I had a meeting
at work, but instead I went to the library

802
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:44,490
at half past eight in the morning, with a
complete day ahead of me.

803
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:49,290
By early afternoon I had got back to the 1940's,

804
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:56,230
It was almost closing time when I reached
19 January 1945.

805
01:08:56,230 --> 01:09:04,060
By now I was tired, but then I saw something
at the bottom of the Budapest page of the

806
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,060
newspaper.

807
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,330
It jumped out at me.

808
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:10,890
It said in Hungarian:

809
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:18,970
YOUNG MOTHER AND CHILD KILLED AS FIGHTING
ENDS IN PEST The story said that the day before

810
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:27,830
(18 January) was the end of the fighting between
the German soldiers inside Pest and the Russians

811
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,140
who were all around them.

812
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:38,590
It then said that the happy day for Pest was
also sad for people in the Thirteenth District:

813
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:48,040
a Russian bomb had hit a Gergely utca building;
it didn't explode, but it destroyed the cellar,

814
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:52,040
killing a young mother and her daughter.

815
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:57,940
The dead woman was later named as Mrs Szabo.

816
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,910
I made a copy of this story and went home.

817
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:06,980
I decided to tell Andrea about what I had
found out.

818
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,290
'And where have you been?'

819
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,580
Andrea asked as I walked into the flat.

820
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,080
'What do you mean?'

821
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,440
I asked back.

822
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:24,210
'I rang you at the office to tell you I was
taking Kati out this afternoon,' she replied.

823
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:32,910
'The receptionist said you weren't there,
and she also said that there was no meeting.'

824
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,900
Andrea was very angry.

825
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,200
I looked at the floor.

826
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,080
'Well, John?'

827
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,450
she went on.

828
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,860
'Where was it this time?

829
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,570
Felka utca?

830
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,290
Gergely utca?

831
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:51,870
Some other stupid street?'

832
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:58,120
'Andrea,' I started, 'I've been reading the
newspapers.'

833
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,370
I took out the copy of the newspaper story.

834
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:04,600
Look,' I said.

835
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,750
She read it quickly.

836
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,150
'And what do you think this shows?'

837
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,880
she asked.

838
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,820
She looked angry.

839
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:19,300
'Well, the date,' I said, 'and the street.

840
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,220
They're the same.

841
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,120
18 January and Gergely utca.'

842
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,860
'So, what are you going to do now?'

843
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,520
she replied.

844
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:37,980
'Well, we must try to find somebody from this
Mrs Szabo's family, I think,' I replied.

845
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:42,830
'Perhaps they still live in the building.'

846
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,670
'Don't say "we",' she said.

847
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:50,790
'I told you that last Sunday was my last time.

848
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:55,460
And anyway, which building: Gergely utca or
Felka utca?'

849
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,500
'I don't know,' I answered.

850
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,170
'But just think about it.

851
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:10,190
My doppelganger comes out of the building
in Felka Utca and runs round to Gergely utca

852
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:13,620
on 18 January.

853
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,540
Perhaps the people were hiding from the fighting
in his house.

854
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,580
He was visiting a friend.

855
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,310
He heard about it, and ran home to see what
had happened.

856
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:28,880
So he lived in Gergely utca.'

857
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:36,820
'You're very good at telling stories, John,'
said Andrea, and walked into the bedroom.

858
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:44,870
'But, Andrea,' I said, following her, 'I've
got to find out, don't you understand?

859
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:51,030
If I don't, I'll never be free of this dream!

860
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:56,920
I have to know the truth it could be important
for me in some way.

861
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:01,770
There has to be a reason for this meeting.'

862
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:05,320
'Look, John,' she said.

863
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:11,230
'You do what you want, but just don't expect
any help from me.

864
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:14,230
Do you understand?'

865
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:21,570
And with that she picked up Kati, who was
already dressed to go out, put on her coat

866
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:28,600
and walked out of the flat.

867
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:35,540
CHAPTER TWELVE
Looking for the truth

868
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:41,670
I stood looking at the closed door and listened
as Andrea took the lift down to the ground

869
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,920
floor.

870
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,190
I tried to decide what to do.

871
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:54,910
I knew Andrea was tired of the doppelganger
story, and so was I. And I knew she wanted

872
01:13:54,910 --> 01:14:01,010
me to spend more time with her and Kati, and
so did I.

873
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:06,960
But I needed to know why this was happening
to me.

874
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:13,440
After a few minutes, I put my coat back on
and walked round to Gergely utca, and met

875
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,390
the housekeeper again.

876
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:20,210
This time I had to do the talking.

877
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:23,460
I asked lots of questions.

878
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:27,280
Was there a family called Szabo in any of
the flats?

879
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,280
No.

880
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:34,800
Had there ever been a family called Szabo
in the time she'd been housekeeper?

881
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,000
No.

882
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,140
Were there any old people living in the building?

883
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:47,900
Only Mrs Kovacs on the second floor, who was
probably in her seventies.

884
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:52,060
I decided to try her.

885
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:58,890
She was a very nice old lady, but she had
only moved into the Flat in 1979 when her

886
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:07,880
husband had died, so she could be closer to
her daughter and family who lived nearby.

887
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:14,670
After that, I walked round to 7 Felka utca
and found the housekeeper.

888
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:20,500
I asked her the same questions, and I was
very happy when she told me that there was

889
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,400
a Szabo family on the third floor!

890
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:32,560
I took the lift up, and found the flat The
door was answered by a big man wearing a dirty

891
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,830
vest.

892
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,350
'Mr Szabo?'

893
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:40,660
I asked, feeling rather unsure of myself.

894
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:46,890
'Who wants to know?' he answered, looking
angry.

895
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:55,420
'I'm... er... trying to find part of my wife's
family called Szabo,' I said, thinking quickly.

896
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:00,540
'I... er... want to know if you can help me.'

897
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:08,270
'What do you want to know?' he asked, in an
ugly voice.

898
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:12,050
'Did your family live in this, flat at the
end of the war?'

899
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,570
I asked.

900
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:19,710
'It's none of your business,' he replied,
starting to shut the door.

901
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:29,240
'Oh please, Mr Szabo,' I've come a long way,
and it's very important for me to find out'

902
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:37,920
'Look,' said Mr Szabo, 'how do I know you're
not the police, or a detective or something?'

903
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,760
'Mr Szabo, look at me,' I replied.

904
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,770
'I'm English.

905
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,290
I work with computers.

906
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:53,380
I only need to know if your family lived here
during the war.'

907
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,680
He seemed to become a little softer.

908
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,640
'No.

909
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:04,310
My parents moved here after the revolution
in 1956,' he said.

910
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:06,380
'They're dead now.

911
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:10,560
I was born here in 1958.

912
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,550
OK?'

913
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:16,850
'Oh, I see,' I answered.

914
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:21,430
'Thank you so much for your time.'

915
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:26,630
What a horrible man, I thought as I walked
back to the lift.

916
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:31,690
And what's more, not the right man!

917
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:34,350
I went back down to the housekeeper.

918
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:40,220
'Not the right Szabos, I'm afraid,' I said
when she came to the door.

919
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:43,420
'Oh dear,' said the lady.

920
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:48,740
'I'm sorry, but we haven't got anymore!'

921
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,190
'But are there any old people?'

922
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,190
I asked.

923
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:57,510
'Or are there any families who have lived
here for a very long time?

924
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:00,140
'Yes,' she answered.

925
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:06,250
'There is one person: old Mrs Fischer on the
fourth floor.

926
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,430
She's been here for ages.'

927
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:13,840
'Oh, wonderful,' I replied with a smile.

928
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,150
'Thank you.'

929
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:24,210
I got back into the lift and went up to the
fourth floor and found the right flat I had

930
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:29,670
to ring the bell again and again before the
old lady opened the door.

931
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,940
She couldn't hear very well.

932
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:38,670
But she let me into her small-kitchen, and
offered me a cup of coffee.

933
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:46,290
'Mrs Fischer, how long have you lived here
in Felka utca?'

934
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:52,020
I had to repeat each question about three
times before she understood what I said, because

935
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:56,020
of my Hungarian and her hearing problems.

936
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:02,160
'Since 1937, my dear,' she replied.

937
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:08,790
'I moved into this flat as a young wife with
my new husband Pal.

938
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:11,140
He died five years ago.'

939
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:16,290
'I'm sorry,' I said.

940
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,670
'Did you live here during the war?'

941
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:22,860
'Yes, we did,' she answered.

942
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,920
'Well, I did.

943
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,640
My husband was away fighting most of the time.'

944
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:37,460
'Were you here in 1945, when the Russians
got the Germans out of Pest?'

945
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,830
I asked.

946
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:44,660
'Yes, I most certainly was,' Mrs Fischer replied.

947
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:52,580
'We didn't know who were worse - the Germans
or the Russians!'

948
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:57,580
'And can you remember any of the other people
who lived in this building then?'

949
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,790
I continued.

950
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:03,780
'Well, some of them, she said.

951
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:08,820
'Lots of people were killed.'

952
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:15,590
Here she seemed to los herself thinking about
those bad days again.

953
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:18,420
'Perhaps you remember a family called Szabo?'

954
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,310
I asked.

955
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:25,200
She looked at me with a very strange face.

956
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:33,210
I thought she was going to say that she remembered
nothing, when suddenly she said very quietly,

957
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:37,370
'Poor, poor Janos.

958
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:42,450
'I looked at the old lady and waited.

959
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:49,790
'Would you like some more coffee, or a glass
of juice, perhaps?'

960
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,960
she said, standing up.

961
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,130
'No, that's fine, thank you, Mrs Fischer,'
I said.

962
01:20:57,130 --> 01:21:05,750
'I'm sorry, but what were you saying about
Janos Szabo a moment ago?'

963
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,340
Again I waited.

964
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:12,890
'Oh, it was terrible,' she said.

965
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:16,370
'We were all so sorry for him.

966
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:20,250
It was such a bad thing to happen.

967
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:27,830
And right on the day when the fighting ended
here in Pest.'

968
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,000
She stopped again.

969
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,540
I waited, thoughts running through my head.

970
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:39,660
'He had looked after his family all through
the war.'

971
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
She said.

972
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:46,800
'His health was not very good, and so he didn't
go away to fight.

973
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,850
Then in 1943 his wife had a baby.

974
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:55,630
A sweet little girl.

975
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:59,960
They were so happy.'

976
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,540
I smiled, thinking of my Kati.

977
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:10,730
'His wife used to go and help in a shop in
a cellar,' she continued.

978
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:13,060
'Then on that day...'

979
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:16,800
'But where was the cellar shop?'

980
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,350
I asked quickly.

981
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:23,000
'Oh, not far,' she replied.

982
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,170
'Just round the corner in Gergely utca.'

983
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,040
I looked at her very hard.

984
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,030
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

985
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:43,910
'And on that day - the day when the fighting
stopped - in January 1945,' went on the old

986
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,170
lady.

987
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:53,570
'Janos was down in the courtyard, the small
outdoor area where children played.

988
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:58,230
He was talking to a few of us neighbours.

989
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:01,940
We knew the fighting was nearly over.

990
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:09,740
You could just hear a few guns from outside
and sometimes a bomb coming in from the Russians.

991
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:18,960
Suddenly, a man ran into our building shouting
for Janos, telling him to go to the Gergely

992
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,420
utca cellar shop quickly: something had happened.

993
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,860
He ran out immediately.

994
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:34,880
And when he came back he had changed completely.'

995
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,770
Here she stopped again for a long time.

996
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:43,020
'Can you tell me what had happened, Mrs Fischer?'

997
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,630
I asked, quietly.

998
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:54,570
'Oh, it was too bad,' she said, her eyes wet
with crying.

999
01:23:54,570 --> 01:24:02,600
'It was such bad luck, so unfair, after all
that war.

1000
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:09,390
A Russian bomb hit the building above the
cellar shop in Gergely utca.

1001
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:16,370
It didn't explode, but it was heavy enough
to destroy the cellar.

1002
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:24,670
And so that poor young woman and the baby
were killed.

1003
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:29,100
So unfair.'

1004
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:34,350
I looked at the old lady feeling both happy
and sad.

1005
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:39,500
I had finally found out the truth from someone
who had been there.

1006
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:43,480
'What happened to Janos after that?'

1007
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,370
I asked.

1008
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:52,370
'Oh, the poor, poor man!' said the old lady.

1009
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:56,920
'He was never the same again.

1010
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,490
He stopped wanting to live.

1011
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:07,410
In the end he died fighting in the streets
in 1956.

1012
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:10,250
We all thought he wanted to die.

1013
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:19,770
He had nothing left to live for.'

1014
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:26,250
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Problems at home

1015
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:30,190
I'm not sure how I walked back to our flat.

1016
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:33,660
I was terribly worried.

1017
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:40,030
Andrea came home with Kati at eight 0'clock,
and put her to bed, I wanted to tell Andrea

1018
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,780
what had happened.

1019
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:49,390
But I didn't know what to say because she
had been so angry about it that afternoon.

1020
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:54,960
I also wanted to talk about what I had been
told.

1021
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,370
I was both very interested and afraid at the
same time.

1022
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:09,700
'Andrea,' I started, 'I've found out what
happened.'

1023
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:15,900
She didn't answer; she was looking at a newspaper.

1024
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:24,980
'Andrea,' I tried again, would you like me
to tell you what I've found out?'

1025
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,130
She looked at me coldly.

1026
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:35,420
'Look, John,' she said, 'you know that I've
really had enough of this story of yours,

1027
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,300
but I expect I'll have to hear the next part.

1028
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:42,520
Go on.'

1029
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:47,250
She looked very tired and worried.

1030
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:52,770
I told her what Mrs Fischer had said quickly
and quietly.

1031
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:55,920
She looked at me as I talked.

1032
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,300
When I had finished she said, 'And so what?'

1033
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:10,200
'Well, don't you understand - it's him I see
every 18 January,' I replied.

1034
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,110
'Who?' asked Andrea.

1035
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:17,790
'Janos Szabo, of course I said.

1036
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:20,460
'Oh, John!'

1037
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,460
she said.

1038
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:24,630
'How can you see a dead man?

1039
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:27,010
I really think you must be ill'

1040
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:30,590
'What do you mean?'

1041
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,590
I asked.

1042
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:39,300
'I mean that you're probably very tired from
work, and because of the baby,' she went on,

1043
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,030
'and that you need some help from a doctor.'

1044
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:51,980
'But, Andrea,' I shouted, 'you came with me
on 18 January and saw what happened...'

1045
01:27:51,980 --> 01:28:01,060
'John, remember that all I saw was you falling
over and shouting,' she said.

1046
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:05,800
I sat looking at her without saying anything.

1047
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,050
My wife didn't believe me.

1048
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,460
She thought that I was ill.

1049
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:16,170
And yet I knew it was all true.

1050
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:23,560
This man - Janos Szabo - my doppelganger - was
there for a reason.

1051
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:31,470
He was there to tell me something, to help
me in some way.

1052
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:37,770
Over the next few weeks, I often tried to
talk about it with Andrea, but she never wanted

1053
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,780
to listen to me.

1054
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:46,571
Sadly, my doppelganger seemed to be building
a wall between us - talking to each other

1055
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:51,580
became much more difficult than it had been
before.

1056
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:57,620
We often spent evenings without talking much,
or my wife went to bed early, saying she was

1057
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:05,050
tired after a day looking after Kati, and
I stayed up watching old films on the TV until

1058
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:08,940
the early hours of the morning.

1059
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:14,200
I thought about it carefully, again and again.

1060
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,710
Some things were true facts.

1061
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:23,810
A man called Janos Szabo had lived at number
7 Felka utca.

1062
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:31,710
On 18 January 1945 his wife and daughter had
been killed in the cellar that was now Zsolt's

1063
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:35,520
bar in Gergely utca.

1064
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,880
Other things were difficult to understand:
I had been outside the Felka utca building

1065
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:48,570
twice on the anniversary of that date - 18
January - and I had met the man.

1066
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:53,050
And he looked the same as me.

1067
01:29:53,050 --> 01:30:00,280
What did it all mean?

1068
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:07,540
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Another year goes by

1069
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,500
The year passed very quickly.

1070
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:16,110
Andrea and I still lived in the same flat;
we slept in the same bed and ate the same

1071
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,210
food.

1072
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:24,350
We both took care of our beautifull little
girl, but really we weren't very close any

1073
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:25,440
more.

1074
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:31,800
It was as if Janos Szabo stood between us.

1075
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:37,600
I spent longer at work each day and quite
often worked an Saturdays, too.

1076
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:44,100
I usually had a, glass of wine at Zsolt's
bar on two or three evenings a week.

1077
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:50,190
On two evenings a week Andrea went out to
yoga classes.

1078
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:53,960
Then things slowly started to change.

1079
01:30:53,960 --> 01:31:00,360
We had a very good time when we took Kati
for her second visit to England in August.

1080
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:06,830
England was so far away from Budapest, and
there were so many things to see and do, and

1081
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:12,550
so many friends and family to visit that I
was able to forget about my meetings with

1082
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,610
myself.

1083
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:23,450
Of course, everyone loved Kati - she was such
a pretty, happy little girl - and this seemed

1084
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:29,630
to help Andrea and I to build our love for
each other again.

1085
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:34,090
Perhaps the best moment of the summer was
when we took Kati to the sea for the first

1086
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,820
time.

1087
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:44,120
She loved playing in the water and on the
beach, and we enjoyed playing with her.

1088
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:51,240
After we came back from our holiday in September
things seemed better at home, too.

1089
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:56,220
I began some very important work which took
much more of my time.

1090
01:31:56,220 --> 01:32:03,110
Andrea decided she wanted to start working
again, so we put Kati into a very nice school

1091
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:05,840
for small children.

1092
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:12,730
It was just mornings at first, but the little
girl liked it so much that in November we

1093
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:16,490
let her stay all day.

1094
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:21,810
Andrea taught a few Hungarian lessons here
and there and also helped Zsolt in his bar

1095
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:24,900
again for a couple of mornings a week.

1096
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:30,990
It seemed as if our problems had gone away.

1097
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:37,880
We spent the Christmas holidays at home on
our own, as a happy little family.

1098
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:44,240
Then for New Year we went to the country to
stay with Andrea's family, as usual.

1099
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:48,660
We had a very good time there, as well.

1100
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:54,380
It was only when I went back to work on 6
January, and I started looking at dates for

1101
01:32:54,380 --> 01:33:01,350
finishing the work I was doing, that I suddenly
realised that it would soon be 18 January

1102
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:02,600
again.

1103
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:09,050
I very much wanted to talk to Andrea about
it, but I was afraid of destroying the happiness

1104
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,160
we had found again.

1105
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:18,840
As if to make me remember what had happened
on 18 January the last two years, I had a

1106
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,690
terrible dream.

1107
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:28,550
It was really the same dream - the door in
Felka utca; the loud noise from somewhere

1108
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:35,280
near, the man running out, me falling onto
the ground and the man running off down the

1109
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,880
street.

1110
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:43,050
I followed him, and this time I watched him
as he started looking for something in the

1111
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:47,250
destroyed cellar in Gergely utca.

1112
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:53,440
Suddenly, I woke up and shouted out, 'Help
me!'

1113
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,610
I was crying and hot.

1114
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:58,320
I felt terrible.

1115
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,140
Andrea woke up.

1116
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,590
'What is it, John?'

1117
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:06,350
she asked.

1118
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:09,820
She looked really afraid.

1119
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:14,810
I looked at her, and pulled her very close
to me.

1120
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:21,320
I had a horrible feeling that this dream and
the meetings with myself had something to

1121
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:27,130
do with her.

1122
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:35,010
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
I discover some more facts

1123
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:39,380
The next day, I was walking home from work.

1124
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:45,840
Of course, I was asking myself if I should
go to meet my doppelganger, Janos Szabo, for

1125
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:50,920
the third time on 18 January.

1126
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:58,240
As I went along a street I saw some men putting
up a new sign on an old shop.

1127
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:05,110
There was the owner's name in red, and below
it the word Szabo in green.

1128
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:10,460
In the window there were suits, jackets and
trousers.

1129
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,820
Szabo.

1130
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:15,190
Tailor.

1131
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:18,370
The tailor was getting a new sign.

1132
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:22,420
'Szabo,' I thought.

1133
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:28,270
Then I said 'Janos Szabo' out loud.

1134
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:31,110
Then I thought, 'Janos the tailor.

1135
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:33,800
John the tailor.

1136
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,710
John Taylor.'

1137
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:39,160
I stopped in the street.

1138
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:43,110
Janos Szabo was John Taylor!

1139
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:47,960
My doppelganger and I shared a name.

1140
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:54,010
John Taylor was the English for the Hungarian
Janos Szabo.

1141
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,620
My hair stood up.

1142
01:35:55,620 --> 01:36:03,920
Here was something new and important: we shared
the same name!

1143
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:11,670
I needed a drink, so I went into Zsolt's bar
and thought about what I had discovered.

1144
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:15,530
I tried to decide what to do.

1145
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:19,020
Should I tell Andrea about this?

1146
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,300
Perhaps it would help her to believe me?

1147
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,020
I didn't know.

1148
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:30,780
I remembered the man in my new dream last
night, in the destroyed cellar, looking for

1149
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,850
something.

1150
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:37,600
I decided to go and see Mrs Fischer again.

1151
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:44,650
I walked quickly round to Felka urca and went
inside and up to her flat.

1152
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:51,400
'Do you remember I came to ask you about Janos
Szabo, Mrs Fischer?'

1153
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,920
I asked when she let me in.

1154
01:36:53,920 --> 01:37:01,390
'Oh, the poor young man: she said, looking
at me sadly.

1155
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:10,630
'And do you know something - you look so like
him, too.'

1156
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:12,910
This was quite a surprise.

1157
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,090
'Really?'

1158
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,320
I asked.

1159
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:21,080
'Come here under the light,' she said.

1160
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,520
I moved under the strong light in the hall.

1161
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,840
'Yes: she said, looking at me carefully.

1162
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,630
'You look very much the same.

1163
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:36,010
The eyes, the nose, the mouth.

1164
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:39,220
Very much the same.

1165
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:44,070
I didn't look at you carefully when you came
last time.

1166
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:49,590
Oh, the poor young man.'

1167
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:52,450
I felt myself getting very hot.

1168
01:37:52,450 --> 01:38:00,050
'Mrs Fischer, I came to ask you something
different,' I said.

1169
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:05,940
Then I went on very slowly, because I was
s afraid of her possible answer.

1170
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:16,380
'Can you remember the names of the wife and
daughter who were killed in th cellar?'

1171
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:26,680
'Well, I know the wife was called Andrea,'
she started, and I felt my face go white,

1172
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:32,610
'but as for the little girl... let's think...'

1173
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,070
I waited for a moment.

1174
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:38,020
She didn't seem able to remember.

1175
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:41,040
'It wasn't...'

1176
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:49,240
I waited, and then said, 'It wasn't Kati,
was it?'

1177
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,210
Mrs Fischer looked at me and smiled.

1178
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:57,640
'Yes, that was it,' she said.

1179
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,220
'Quite right.

1180
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:03,070
Andrea and Kati.

1181
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:07,330
The poor young things.'

1182
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:11,460
I thanked her and left as quickly as I could.

1183
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:15,210
My head was turning round and round.

1184
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,830
I felt sick.

1185
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:23,220
Outside in the cold street, I stood against
the wall of the building.

1186
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:31,560
There were too many new things inside my head
to understand at once: my doppelganger had

1187
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:40,610
the same name as me - Szabo, or Taylor - I
looked like him, and his wife and daughter

1188
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:45,880
had the same names as mine!

1189
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:52,800
I started to ask myself how many other things
about our live: were the same.

1190
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:57,590
The next week I went to the Public Records
Office in my lunch break.

1191
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:04,280
This is the office where they keep information
about everyone who lives in Hungary today,

1192
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:09,550
and also about people who lived there in the
past.

1193
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:17,900
I asked for information about Janos Szabo
who had lived in Felka utca in 1945 and died

1194
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,140
in 1956.

1195
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:23,150
It was surprisirigly easy with their new computers.

1196
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:30,670
By now, I almost expected the information
that the assistant gave me: that Janos had

1197
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:34,750
been born on 23 October.

1198
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:38,520
That was my birthday, too.

1199
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:44,590
I was now sure that all these facts about
his life and mine were not just the same by

1200
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:46,100
chance.

1201
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:53,360
I believed my doppelganger was trying to tell
me something important, but I didn't know

1202
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,650
what.

1203
01:40:55,650 --> 01:41:02,170
I wanted to talk about it wit Andrea, but
that still seemed impossible.

1204
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:08,670
First of all, she wouldn't listen to me, and
then even if she did listen I didn't think

1205
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,050
she would understand.

1206
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:17,800
Or she wouldn't want to understand because
she was too worried by the story.

1207
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:29,520
I decided to wait and see if I could meet
my Doppelganger again on 18 January.

1208
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:36,070
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
It all happens again

1209
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:43,220
Every night from then on I had the dream in
all its possible forms the opening door, the

1210
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:49,760
running man, the loud noise, the man who was
looking for something.

1211
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:55,120
Sometimes it was me who ran out of the door,
and sometimes it was me who was knocked onto

1212
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:02,880
the ground; sometimes I was looking for something,
sometimes I was watching the man looking for

1213
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,070
something.

1214
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:17,760
And behind everything I could hear a man's
voice shouting, 'Help me!' and 'Andrea, Kati!'

1215
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:28,360
Again and again I woke up hot, cold, crying,
shouting and always terribly afraid.

1216
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:33,420
I didn't tell Andrea, but I knew she knew.

1217
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:40,270
I could tell she had woken up when I did,
although she never said anything.

1218
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:45,390
I felt that she, too, was afraid of what was
happening to me.

1219
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:53,000
Saturday 18 January was a grey, cold winter's
day.

1220
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:59,240
It wasn't snowing, but it looked as if it
would soon.

1221
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:03,130
I got up early and went to work.

1222
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:08,570
My boss had asked me to go into the office
and go through a new work plan with him, before

1223
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:11,690
talking about it with the other people on
Monday.

1224
01:43:11,690 --> 01:43:19,480
It took much longer than expected and I didn't
get home until half past six.

1225
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,460
'Hello!'

1226
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:25,740
I shouted as I walked through the door of
our flat.

1227
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:27,530
'Hello.

1228
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:30,340
Where are you?'

1229
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,230
There was no reply.

1230
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:38,120
I walked into the living room and there on
the table was a note.

1231
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,630
Dear John,

1232
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:43,140
Zsolt phoned.

1233
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:49,760
His mothers ill and I offered to look after
the bar while he takes her to the doctors.

1234
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,480
I couldn't get Petra to look after Kati, so
I've taken her with me.

1235
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,430
Won't be long I hope!

1236
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:59,590
See you later.

1237
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:00,590
Love,

1238
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:04,530
Andrea and Kati

1239
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:07,010
My blood went cold.

1240
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:09,450
I looked at my watch.

1241
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:12,190
It was quarter to seven.

1242
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:19,760
I ran into the hall, forgetting my coat, and
ran downstairs and out into the street.

1243
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:23,170
Then I started running towards the bar.

1244
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:26,100
It was nearly five to seven.

1245
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:34,190
I turned right into Felka utca - not left
into Gergely utca and ran up to number 7.

1246
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:37,480
The big front door was open.

1247
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:43,380
I went inside, I was breathing quickly because
I'd been running.

1248
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:49,350
I could hear the noise of a television or
radio from one of the flats.

1249
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:56,420
Suddenly, there was a very loud noise like
a bomb from outside somewhere.

1250
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,890
All the windows shook.

1251
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:03,850
One or two windows opened, and voices called
out to each other in the dark.

1252
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:07,610
'What was that?' asked one.

1253
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:11,590
'I don't know,' someone replied.

1254
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:16,070
'It sounded like a bomb,' said a third.

1255
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:20,840
Just then, I heard someone shouting outside
in the street.

1256
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,140
'Help!

1257
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:23,440
Help!

1258
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,130
There's been an explosion in Gergely utca.

1259
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:30,380
Help everybody!'

1260
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:36,240
I ran out of the building, the door shutting
loudly behind me.

1261
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:39,670
In the street, I ran straight into someone.

1262
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:43,440
'Look out!' said a man.

1263
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,540
He fell to the ground.

1264
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:50,360
I looked down, asking myself what I was going
to see.

1265
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:55,060
There was the man who looked like me lying
on the ground.

1266
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:56,980
'Sorry...'

1267
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:00,170
I said in Hungarian.

1268
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:05,510
And then I ran along Felka utca and crossed
over the road.

1269
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,760
My mind was racing.

1270
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:16,800
I was thinking all the time about what I was
going to find.

1271
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:25,050
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
We must get them out!

1272
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:30,050
When I turned into Gergely utca I stopped
running.

1273
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:33,380
It was difficult to see where I was going.

1274
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:39,320
The street was full of smoke, like a thick
grey cloud everywhere.

1275
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:44,900
I couldn't see anything, and the smell of
gas was terrible.

1276
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:52,500
Perhaps a gas pipe in one of the old buildings
had broken, and that had started the explosion.

1277
01:46:52,500 --> 01:47:00,220
I took my handkerchief out and put it across
my mouth and nose, and walked along the street.

1278
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:06,690
There was also the loud noise of car alarms
ringing - started by the explosion.

1279
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:12,090
I found I was walking on glass from all the
broken windows.

1280
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:16,570
People were already trying to knock out the
other pieces of glass from their windows,

1281
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:23,170
and some had started to put paper and plastic
over them to keep their flats warm.

1282
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:28,420
I knew, had got to Zsolt's bar because there
was a small crowd of people standing around

1283
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:30,250
it.

1284
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:34,860
I looked down; there was nothing left.

1285
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:41,740
I couldn't see the steps going down, the windows
or even the walls - there was just a lot of

1286
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:44,000
broken stones.

1287
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,170
I looked and looked, my mind completely empty.

1288
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:53,570
Suddenly, I understood what had happened.

1289
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:56,150
'My wife!'

1290
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:58,410
I shouted in Hungarian.

1291
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:01,530
'My wife and daughter are in there.

1292
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,780
We must get them out!

1293
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,400
Help me!'

1294
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,590
people looked at me.

1295
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:12,970
'Come on,' I said, looking at the people standing
around.

1296
01:48:12,970 --> 01:48:16,990
'We must get them out!'

1297
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:19,670
I started to give orders.

1298
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:25,110
I made everybody stand in a line, and told
them to pass along the stones from the destroyed

1299
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:28,340
building and put them in the street.

1300
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:34,110
Then I got to work, picking up the broken
pieces of wood and stone.

1301
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:39,680
The people soon got the idea, and we worked
as a good team.

1302
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:44,720
I was very pleased to see other neighbours
coming and joining in on the other side of

1303
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:48,760
what had been the front of the bar.

1304
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,660
Surprisingly soon, I was down to where the
doorway had been.

1305
01:48:52,660 --> 01:49:02,150
At that moment, I heard the noise of police
cars, fire engines and ambulances coming closer,

1306
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:05,430
and the people I was working with stopped
helping me.

1307
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:07,920
'What's the matter?'

1308
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:08,920
I shouted.

1309
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:11,580
'We must get my wife and...'

1310
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:16,660
'Come on out, sir, please,' said a voice.

1311
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,530
I looked up.

1312
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:23,670
In the grey light the person who had spoken
looked very big and black above me.

1313
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:28,670
'But my wife and my daughter are in here,'
I shouted.

1314
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:32,550
'We must get them out!'

1315
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:37,870
And I threw the pieces of wood and stone that
I had in my hands up into the street, and

1316
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:42,400
turned to get some more from the destroyed
doorway.

1317
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:48,190
But then strong hands got hold of me and pulled
me up into the street.

1318
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:52,010
'Just come out of the way, sir,' said the
voice.

1319
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:54,150
'But my wife...!'

1320
01:49:54,150 --> 01:50:02,010
'I understand, sir,' said the voice, which
I now realised came from a fireman, 'but it's

1321
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:04,380
too dangerous for you to go in there.

1322
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,900
Leave it to us.

1323
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:11,550
The, place is full of gas - can't you smell
it?'

1324
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:14,260
I could smell it now I had stopped.

1325
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:18,500
And I could feel it inside my body.

1326
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:27,290
The fireman let me go, and I fell down onto
the street and started crying.

1327
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:33,030
I was lifted up by more hands, and soon I
was lying in the back of an ambulance parked

1328
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:36,190
a few metres down the street.

1329
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:42,720
I was coughing a lot, so a nurse put something
over my face to help me breathe.

1330
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:46,070
I started to feel better and tried to sit
up.

1331
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:50,790
'Just lie down, please,' said the nurse.

1332
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:55,010
'You need to rest for a while.'

1333
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:59,380
'But my wife and daughter were in that cellar,'
I said.

1334
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:02,300
'I have to find them.'

1335
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:09,990
'There's nothing you can do now, sir,' said
the voice in a very gentle way.

1336
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:13,290
'Just rest.'

1337
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:16,570
I must have slept for a few minutes.

1338
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:19,630
When I woke, I sat up.

1339
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:23,530
Then I stood up and stepped out into the street.

1340
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:26,130
The ambulance men were standing outside.

1341
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:32,010
'Are you feeling any better, sir?' one of
them asked.

1342
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:35,450
'Yes, much better, thanks,' I replied.

1343
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:37,980
'Is there any news?'

1344
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:47,470
'Not yet, sir,' said another ambulance I pushed
my way through the crowd, which was much bigger

1345
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:48,990
now.

1346
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:55,090
The air was clearer too, but the street was
full of blue lights.

1347
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:59,630
The firemen had put some lights in front of
Zsolt's bar so that they could see what they

1348
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:05,360
were doing, and the police were keeping people
away.

1349
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:09,970
I called to one of the policemen and explained
that I was the husband of someone who had

1350
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:16,100
been in the cellar, and he took me over to
a police van on the other side of the street.

1351
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:22,670
'Good evening, sir,' said a young policeman
sitting inside the van.

1352
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:24,900
'Take a seat.'

1353
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,310
I sat down opposite him.

1354
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:30,880
'Is there any news yet?'

1355
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,070
I asked him.

1356
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:37,720
'Not yet, I'm afraid, sir,' he said, looking
serious.

1357
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:44,170
'Could I ask you for some information, please?'

1358
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:51,990
And for the next five minutes I gave him facts
and dates about myself, Andrea and Kati, which

1359
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:55,410
he wrote down on many different pieces of
paper.

1360
01:52:55,410 --> 01:53:02,300
He also asked me what I knew about the bar
and the people who worked there, and who might

1361
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:05,460
have been inside when the explosion happened.

1362
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:09,350
"'What shall I do now?'

1363
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:12,890
I asked, feeling very unsure of myself.

1364
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:22,200
'Well, sir,' he replied, 'you live nearby,
so why don't you go home and wait there?

1365
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:26,720
I've got your telephone number and I'll call
you as soon as we have any news.'

1366
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:32,990
'OK,' I said.

1367
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:35,660
'Thanks.'

1368
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:41,470
I got out of the van, and pushed back through
the crowd, leaving the lights and the noise

1369
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:44,270
behind me.

1370
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:47,650
I felt terrible.

1371
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:51,530
Deep inside I didn't believe that anybody
in that cellar could have lived through the

1372
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:54,010
explosion.

1373
01:53:54,010 --> 01:53:58,450
The bar was completely destroyed.

1374
01:53:58,450 --> 01:54:03,920
It was impossible for Andrea and Kati to be
alive.

1375
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,690
I then started thinking about how stupid I'd
been.

1376
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:13,860
"Why hadn't I told Andrea what I'd seen in
my dreams and what I'd found out from Mrs

1377
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:15,990
Fischer?

1378
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:21,380
I couldn't believe I had killed my own wife
and child.

1379
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:27,220
And all because I was too interested in the
doppelganger story to think carefully about

1380
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:31,330
the two people I loved most in the world.

1381
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:38,000
Too interested in the doppelganger story to
think about what my doppelganger wanted to

1382
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,300
tell me...

1383
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:43,730
How stupid I'd been!

1384
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:48,520
The bar had been destroyed.

1385
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:52,960
My wife and child had been destroyed.

1386
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:58,190
And my life was now destroyed.

1387
01:54:58,190 --> 01:55:05,760
I would never be happy again.

1388
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:13,580
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Unexpected help

1389
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:21,730
I was walking along Gergely utca very slowly,
feeling as if I wanted to die.

1390
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:25,070
I wasn't looking where I was going.

1391
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:30,580
I was looking down at the ground, lost in
my thoughts.

1392
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:33,130
Suddenly, when I got to the.

1393
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:37,720
comer of the street, I walked into somebody.

1394
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:43,380
'Sorry,' I said, looking up.

1395
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:48,420
I saw it was someone like me I was looking
at.

1396
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:52,300
It was my doppelganger again.

1397
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:55,570
We looked into each other's eyes.

1398
01:55:55,570 --> 01:56:00,690
And then he lifted his arm and pointed his
finger.

1399
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:06,900
I looked where he was pointing, and I could
see two small people at the end of the dark

1400
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:09,130
street.

1401
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:13,510
One was a woman and one was a child.

1402
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:16,950
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1403
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:19,000
'Andrea!'

1404
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,960
I shouted.

1405
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,920
'Kati!'

1406
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:29,260
As I started to run towards them, I looked
back at the man.

1407
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:32,050
There was no one there.

1408
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:37,880
We all three ran to each other, and held each
other for a long time.

1409
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:41,320
'Thank goodness!'

1410
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:43,320
I said at last.

1411
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,920
'I thought...

1412
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:46,990
I thought you were...'

1413
01:56:46,990 --> 01:56:51,900
'Sssh,' said Andrea, putting her hand over
my mouth.

1414
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:56,680
'And we would be, but for your "friend".'

1415
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:59,220
'What friend?'

1416
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,090
I asked.

1417
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:02,490
'Zsolt?'

1418
01:57:02,490 --> 01:57:08,450
'No, John,' she said, laughing.

1419
01:57:08,450 --> 01:57:11,550
'Your doppelganger.'

1420
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,110
'My...?'

1421
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:15,300
I stood with my mouth open.

1422
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:20,590
'What on earth do you mean?'

1423
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:24,410
And so Andrea explained to me what had happened.

1424
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:32,230
'I walked round to the bar with Kati, ready
to help while Zsolt was away at the doctor's.

1425
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:37,550
Zsolt was already standing in the street when
I got there.

1426
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:42,660
He told me there was no one in the bar, and
so we stood talking in the street for a few

1427
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:45,130
minutes.

1428
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:51,290
Then he got into his car and went off to take
his mother to the doctor's.

1429
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:58,720
When I turned round to go down to the bar,
I saw you standing in front of the entrance.

1430
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:02,790
I called your name, and asked you what you
wanted.

1431
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:09,870
But you said nothing, and I tried to go down
into the bar.

1432
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:12,210
You didn't move.

1433
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:17,570
I asked you to get out of the way, but you
didn't.

1434
01:58:17,570 --> 01:58:20,540
And then Kati started crying.

1435
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:22,950
I asked her what the matter was.

1436
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:28,380
"See what you've done now, John - you've made
her cry."

1437
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:30,910
I said to you.

1438
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:34,350
Kati was crying and shaking her head.

1439
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:38,170
"Not Daddy," she said.

1440
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:41,270
"Not Daddy."

1441
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:46,620
I looked at the man in front of me again,
as carefully as I could in the dark winter

1442
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:51,910
light... and then I realised it must be your
doppelganger.

1443
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:56,570
The coat was different - it looked old-fashioned.

1444
01:58:56,570 --> 01:59:04,670
Suddenly, I remembered what it had said about
doppelgangers in that book you'd brought home:

1445
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:11,820
"it can sometimes be seen by somebody close
if it has an important message".

1446
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:17,550
As I looked, the man pointed down the street.

1447
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:20,660
I looked where he was pointing.

1448
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:23,240
There was nothing.

1449
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:26,840
I looked at the man and asked him what he
meant.

1450
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:33,040
Again the man pointed down the street, and
finally I understood that he wanted me to

1451
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,230
go away.

1452
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:37,500
So I did.

1453
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:40,490
I walked home.

1454
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:44,940
When we got home, Kati fell asleep on the
sofa.

1455
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:48,430
While she was sleeping I made some tea.

1456
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:54,570
Suddenly, I heard a loud noise like a bomb
from somewhere outside.

1457
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:57,920
It sounded quite far away.

1458
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:03,110
It took me some time to wake Kati and get
her dressed again and we came to see what

1459
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:04,440
had happened.

1460
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:12,990
Of course, I was really afraid that you had
been in the bar, John.'

1461
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:17,470
We looked at each other as we reached the
outside door of the block of flats where we

1462
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:19,170
lived.

1463
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:24,340
'This is a very strange story,' I said.

1464
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:29,630
'It certainly is,' said Andrea.

1465
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:31,730
'You must write it down.'

1466
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:36,450
'I will,' I said.

1467
02:00:36,450 --> 02:01:36,160
And we went inside and shut out 

1468
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,280
the night.

1469
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:37,570
- THE END -
