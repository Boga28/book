00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,760
CHAPTER ONE
Arlo's War

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,799
The snake's world was a silent one.

3
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:13,210
Its world was a box with a glass front.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,230
It was staring at its next meal.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,000
Its meal, a rat, was staring back.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,220
The rat sat frozen with fear in the corner
of the large box.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:34,590
It heard a soft shaking sound and answered
with a few high sounds of terror.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,020
The snake was hungry and moved quickly.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,440
It was a big North American diamond-backed
rattlesnake, almost two meters long with enough

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
poison in its bite to kill several men.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,430
The rat was soon dead and the snake stretched
its jaws to begin the business of swallowing

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,550
its meal.

13
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,050
Arlo Penton sat and watched through the glass
as Susie ate her rat.

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,870
The sight made him feel a little uncomfortable
- it always did - but that, he thought, was

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,210
the way of Nature.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,980
And he did admire snakes.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,770
He admired their smooth beauty and their beautiful
patterned skins.

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,159
But most of all he admired their deafness.

19
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,760
Arlo had discovered some years before that
snakes were completely deaf.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,400
They depended mostly on their highly developed
sense of smell, and their tongues could actually

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,690
taste smells from the air.

22
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,560
As well as this, their expressionless eyes
could see the heat given off by the bodies

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,350
of other animals.

24
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,280
Arlo watched with feelings of deep respect
as the rat slowly disappeared down Susie's

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,780
throat.

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:08,140
The snake lived in a world without annoying
continuous noise.

27
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,129
A silent world.

28
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:15,459
To Arlo, snakes stood for beauty and perfection.

29
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,169
He loved to watch them and admire them.

30
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,650
If only his own world could be as silent as
theirs!

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,010
That was why he had caught Susie.

32
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,529
More correctly, he had Chico - a local gardener
- catch her for him.

33
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:38,279
Susie had been caught in the rocky dry land
that bordered Tucson, Arizona, where Arlo

34
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,969
lived.

35
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:45,689
Chico was most casual in the way he touched
dangerous snakes.

36
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,500
Sometimes he would even eat them.

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
'They're good to eat and they're free,' he
would say.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,579
This disgusted Arlo, not because he didn't
like the idea of snakes being used as food,

39
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,040
but because he thought it failed to give the
snake enough respect.

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,650
Nevertheless, he was glad Chico had found
Susie.

41
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,219
She was a beauty.

42
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,599
Arlo liked living at the edge of town.

43
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,030
He had to drive to work and it took him over
an hour each way.

44
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,999
It was noisy and hot, but at least he had
quiet when he got home.

45
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,930
Quiet was very important to Arlo.

46
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,019
As a young man he had been a soldier and had
fought in a war.

47
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,809
His mind had been damaged by the noise of
loud and terrible explosions and he had to

48
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:45,540
be sent to a hospital at home to recover.

49
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,430
He had met his wife, Maria, there.

50
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,230
She was one of the nurses who had looked after
him.

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,599
He still hated noise.

52
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,299
'Everybody talks about pollution,' Arlo would
say to anybody who would listen.

53
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,159
'The way we poison our environment with this
and that, yet the one thing which really poisons

54
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,709
the quality of our lives is noise.

55
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,930
Everywhere you go you hear people making noise,
noise, noise.

56
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,620
Where can you hear the birds sing these days?

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,870
Not in the city, my friend.

58
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,010
All you hear is traffic, loud radios and people
with noisy machinery.

59
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,320
Twenty-four hours a day it's noise, noise,
noise.

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,690
It's enough to drive you crazy.'

61
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,940
Too much noise took Arlo back, in his mind,
to the war with its loud explosions that had

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,870
brought death and suffering.

63
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,820
Maria had saved him from madness.

64
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,230
Maria and his work and his pills.

65
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:57,850
To look at, Arlo was like many other fifty-nine-year-old
men: he was of average height and his once-dark

66
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,250
hair was now grey.

67
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,940
He was neither fat nor thin and dressed casually
- usually in black trousers, a blue shirt

68
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,990
and his favourite cowboy hat.

69
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,750
His thin face had taken on a more troubled
look since Maria had died of cancer one year

70
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,750
before.

71
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,980
She had helped him through the bad times and
made sure he took the pills he needed to keep

72
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,290
him calm.

73
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,850
But now Maria was gone.

74
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,920
They had no children.

75
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,830
Most of Arlo's time was now given to his work.

76
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,420
Even when he was at home he would be thinking
about work, putting new ideas down onto his

77
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,950
computer.

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,020
His work was his life.

79
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:52,590
Arlo had a job in a company called Teckno-Toys,
which made electronic toys for children.

80
00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:00,280
He was the company's chief designer of radio-controlled
toys, such as cars and aeroplanes.

81
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,050
These toys were so clever and amazing that
many fathers bought them at Christmas for

82
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,060
their children, only to play with them themselves.

83
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,470
The cries of Aw, Dad, can I have a go now?'
were often heard in many homes where Dad had

84
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,370
bought one of Arlo's marvelous toys.

85
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,750
His toys were indeed wonderful.

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,720
The cars were tough but fast, while the aeroplanes
were like magical birds that would fly up

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
or down and turn in the air whenever you told
them to.

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,920
They could be guided from great distances
with the powerful electronic controls that

89
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,930
Arlo designed.

90
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,390
What Arlo liked best about his work was the
electrical side.

91
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,980
He would leave the design of the toy's body
to others, but design the electronic controls

92
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,810
himself.

93
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,840
By the time the toy was finished it would
be the best that money could buy.

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,750
Arlo had a garage full of small model planes,
boats and cars he had made.

95
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,500
He often used them to help test out new designs
at home - that was why he had been allowed

96
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,670
to keep them.

97
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,590
The Teckno-Toys factory was quite separate
from the place where Arlo worked.

98
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,930
He needed quiet so that he could concentrate
and did not want loud upsetting noises to

99
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,860
remind him of the war.

100
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,800
He could never do this next to a noisy factory.

101
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,560
He did his work in an old large house in the
centre of the city called The Havens, which

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,530
was owned by the company.

103
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,510
The house was unusual in having its own spacious
grounds that protected it from the loud noises

104
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,240
of the city.

105
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,050
Arlo worked there with a few other favoured
employees.

106
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,930
They would send their designs to the factory,
which would build the models then return them

107
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,210
to Arlo and his colleagues to be checked.

108
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,450
This arrangement suited Arlo: he had a quiet
place to work in, while Teckno-Toys got top-quality

109
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,750
new toys that were sure to sell well.

110
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,100
Keeping Arlo happy at The Havens had been
worth it to them.

111
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,560
So far.

112
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,540
Arlo had made enough money from his work to
buy a spacious house outside the city and

113
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,260
away from the noisy traffic.

114
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,719
He built a large wooden tower in the garden
so that he could control his models from great

115
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,490
distances.

116
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,459
He loved that.

117
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:43,419
But he missed Maria and his sleep was sometimes
troubled, especially when he forgot to take

118
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,569
his pills.

119
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:49,759
But, at least he had his work to take his
mind off the war.

120
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,990
Work was all he had left.

121
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,089
Bernie Dimaggio, Vice President of Teckno-Toys,
held a towel as he watched his boss on her

122
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,630
exercise cycle.

123
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,760
She often spoke to him while doing her early
morning exercises in the private gym she had

124
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,699
next to her office.

125
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:15,449
She got off the machine and he handed her
the towel.

126
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:17,949
'He's not going to like it, Miss De Cruz.

127
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:21,000
You know how he feels about the place!'

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,899
Bernie's suntan could not hide the way his
face turned red as he spoke

129
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:32,309
'You seem to forget who you are talking to,
Mr Dimaggio, I am now the head of Teckno-Toys.

130
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,629
My father was old-fashioned in his ways.

131
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:40,760
He made this company but if we are to become
the market leader we must change with the

132
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,180
times.'

133
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,430
'But Miss De Cruz...' began Bernie.

134
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,430
'Enough, Mr Dimaggio.

135
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:53,249
You may be Vice President and your concern
for one of our... er... senior employees is

136
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,249
understandable.

137
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,860
But we have a business to run.

138
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,980
We have to progress; we have money to consider.

139
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,529
We can't afford not to sell a valuable property
like The Havens just because an old man close

140
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:13,160
to retirement likes a bit of quiet, not when
we need the money for building up the factory.

141
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,009
It's just not good business sense, Mr Dimaggio,
and we both know it.'

142
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:22,910
'But Arlo has been working at The Havens for
twenty years!

143
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,709
He couldn't work anywhere else now.

144
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,459
You knew him when you were just a kid, Miss
De Cruz...'

145
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:33,779
'I'm not a 'kid' any more, Mr Dimaggio, in
case you haven't noticed.

146
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,800
And I have a business to run.

147
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,440
The property will be sold.

148
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,189
If Mr Penton wants to continue to work for
Teckno-Toys, he will have to work at the factory,

149
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:45,949
like the rest of us.

150
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,980
Or he can go.

151
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,769
I trust you will let him know of this development
at the appropriate time.'

152
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:57,649
'You mean after he's completed the designs
for the new season's models?'

153
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:58,869
'Exactly.

154
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,050
No sense in upsetting him just now.

155
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,899
Not while he's doing useful work.

156
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:11,350
It's not good business, Mr Dimaggio, you ought
to know that,' said Eva De Cruz firmly.

157
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,089
Bernie Dimaggio had been with the company
since Eva De Cruz had been a child.

158
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,689
He had seen the business grow as Eva grew.

159
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:25,119
It was a successful business, though not yet
the biggest of its kind.

160
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:30,880
He looked at his new boss, the twenty-five-year-old
daughter of Diego De Cruz, his former boss

161
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,540
and friend.

162
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,249
Eva had studied at the best business school
and she wanted to show the world that she

163
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,819
was going to be better than her father had
ever been.

164
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:44,300
Better and richer.

165
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,869
After Diego's wife, Eva's mother, had died
fifteen years before, Diego De Cruz had put

166
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,670
all of his energies into the business.

167
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:59,641
The education of his daughter and only child
was left to private boarding schools, where

168
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:02,179
she had lived for most of the time.

169
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:08,519
She had been educated from a distance, like
one of Diego's toys.

170
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,670
And Eva was the result.

171
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,379
Everything about her was businesslike, from
her usual dark blue suit to her electronic

172
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,459
organizer.

173
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,809
Bernie sometimes wondered if her brain had
become electronic, too.

174
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:30,189
And what would happen to Arlo once he was
told about the sale of The Havens?

175
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:36,410
Both he and Diego had been in the army with
Arlo during the war and had become friends.

176
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,019
After the war they had given Arlo work he
could do in peace.

177
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,889
They wanted to help him put his broken mind
back together.

178
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:52,689
Diego had promised Arlo that there would always
be a peaceful place for him to work at Teckno-Toys.

179
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,209
What would this news do to him?

180
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,839
'Couldn't you find somewhere else quiet for
him, Miss De Cruz,' Bernie asked, 'where he

181
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,879
can carry on his work?

182
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,879
Diego...

183
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,310
I mean, your father...

184
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,920
promised Arlo somewhere quiet a long time
ago!'

185
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,939
'That was then, this is now.

186
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:18,170
We can't afford to treat him any differently
from the rest of us, Mr Dimaggio,' she said

187
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,589
after drying her face with the towel and throwing
it back to him.

188
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,959
'Now excuse me, but I have another appointment
in twenty minutes.'

189
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,230
Eva left him with the damp towel.

190
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,329
Bernie was close to retirement age himself.

191
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,910
He felt sorry for Arlo.

192
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,810
Diego would have done something to help, but
not Eva.

193
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,769
He might lose his own job if he didn't do
as she told him.

194
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:53,639
Bernie felt older and weaker as he walked
out of the gym.

195
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,089
While Eva and Bernie were talking, Arlo was
getting into his car to go to work.

196
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,179
He had forgotten to take his pill again.

197
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,129
His face was already sweating.

198
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,540
It was a bright sunny morning and the roads
would be hot.

199
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,639
He was glad he had completed the new designs
and was looking forward to handing them in

200
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,179
personally, as usual, to Bernie Dimaggio.

201
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,459
They lay on the seat next to him as he drove
to the city center.

202
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,509
The road was already busy with the morning
rush of traffic.

203
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,519
Arlo had to stop at a set of traffic lights.

204
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,829
The car next to him was a sports car with
an open top.

205
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:40,069
The man at the wheel was young and wore dark
glasses.

206
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:46,750
He was listening to loud rock music and was
nodding his head to the rhythm as he listened.

207
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,980
Arlo could not understand how anybody could
listen to such a loud noise without damaging

208
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,850
their ears.

209
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,980
He could feel the noise hitting his own head
in solid waves.

210
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,100
It was painful.

211
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,920
He shouted to the man to turn the sound down.

212
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,269
The man saw him and laughed, then turned the
sound up even more.

213
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:17,579
Fortunately, the lights changed at that moment
and they both drove away.

214
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:23,220
Arlo let the sports car speed ahead, taking
its noise with it.

215
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,589
Everything seemed to be noisy on that journey.

216
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,939
Other cars had noisy radios.

217
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:35,959
Arlo swore at the Tucson rock music radio
station as he passed it by.

218
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:40,420
Then he heard some loud machines at some new
building works.

219
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,110
Car horns sounded at every pause in the stream
of traffic, and everywhere people seemed to

220
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,170
be shouting, shouting, shouting.

221
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,290
At last, the turning for The Havens came into
view.

222
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,300
He could hardly wait to enter the peaceful
building!

223
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:05,320
As he drove through the private grounds all
the awful noises disappeared into the distance.

224
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,959
When Arlo stopped the car his body was shaking
and covered in sweat.

225
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,430
Echoes of loud noises were still in his head,
some of them terrible memories of the war.

226
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,720
He took a few deep breaths to calm himself,
then picked up his designs and walked into

227
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
the big house.

228
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,100
It was nine o'clock at The Havens.

229
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,240
Bernie Dimaggio was early.

230
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,069
He was waiting in the office as Arlo walked
in.

231
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:40,309
He noticed that Arlo was holding the envelope
containing the new designs.

232
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:43,749
He also noticed how upset Arlo looked.

233
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,269
'Hi Arlo!

234
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:48,319
Hey, are you OK?

235
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:51,600
You don't look so good, if you don't mind
me saying so.

236
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,860
Are you still sleeping OK?

237
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,889
Hey, if you need anything just say the word.'

238
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,800
Arlo smiled.

239
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,120
Bernie was always concerned about him when
it was time to hand in his designs.

240
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,200
Did he think he would finally go crazy before
completing them?

241
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,630
Probably.

242
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,579
Bernie had always been a worrier.

243
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,390
Arlo looked into the familiar suntanned face
and answered, 'I'm fine, Bernie.

244
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,880
At least, I would be if I walked around with
my ears closed.

245
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,110
I swear this town is getting noisier every
day.'

246
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,380
'Oh no,' thought Bernie.

247
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,500
'I hope he's not going to give me another
long talk about noise pollution!'

248
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,760
Bernie decided to change the subject quickly.

249
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,740
'You have the designs I see, Arlo.

250
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,450
All ready for production?'

251
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,770
Arlo handed over the envelope, giving it a
firm tap with his hand on the way.

252
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,800
'You bet, Bernie.

253
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,730
This one is going to be a winner, I'm telling
you.

254
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,980
The kids are going to love it!

255
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,890
It's easy to control, yet it's as quiet as
a baby asleep in its mother's arms!'

256
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,300
'Everything's checked?' asked Bernie.

257
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,110
'Checked and double-checked,' Arlo answered.

258
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,810
'You ought to know me by now.'

259
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,550
Bernie did know.

260
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,510
If Arlo said something was ready, it was ready.

261
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:22,890
He put the designs in his briefcase and began
to walk towards the door as he thanked Arlo.

262
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,450
Then he stopped and turned to him, pulling
another smaller envelope from his jacket pocket.

263
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:35,960
'Oh, I almost forgot... said Bernie, though
he had done no such thing.

264
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,110
'Here's some mail from the factory for you.'

265
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,560
'What is it?'

266
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,290
Arlo asked as he took the envelope.

267
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,200
Bernie looked at his watch.

268
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,220
He wasn't brave enough to face Arlo's reaction
to the sale of The Havens.

269
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,850
'Hey, I've got to go to a meeting right now.

270
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,570
See you later, OK?'

271
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,100
'OK,' said Arlo as Bernie smiled nervously
and left.

272
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,840
'He sure was in a rush,' he thought.

273
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,480
'Maybe the noise has been getting to that
guy, too.

274
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,800
I wouldn't be surprised.

275
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,900
Nothing surprises me anymore.'

276
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:19,360
Arlo sat down with a sigh and opened the envelope.

277
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,650
Eva De Cruz tested her coffee.

278
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,890
It was black with no sugar, just as she liked
it.

279
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,480
As she sat at her office desk she thought
that things, on the whole, could be a lot

280
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,730
worse.

281
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,520
It had been a month since the old man had
left them.

282
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,640
She had expected him to make a lot more fuss
about the whole business.

283
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,310
She knew he would never work in the factory
grounds, not with his unreasonable attitude

284
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,290
towards perfectly normal noise levels.

285
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,580
All the other designers had agreed to the
new arrangements.

286
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,460
She couldn't change the world just because
one employee had had some unfortunate experiences

287
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,860
in the war.

288
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,690
That wasn't her problem.

289
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,660
Besides, The Havens had been knocked down
by the new owners.

290
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,870
They had already started to build a new radio
station on the grounds.

291
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,870
It was going to be the biggest rock music
radio station in Arizona.

292
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,030
Teckno-Toys had made a lot of money out of
the sale.

293
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:29,110
And if the old man didn't like it... well,
that was just too bad.

294
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,150
Eva De Cruz had known Arlo for most of her
life.

295
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,960
She had even played with some of the toys
he had designed while they were in the testing

296
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,440
stage.

297
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,430
She had loved the toys but the man who designed
them was, to her, just a strange old man who

298
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,440
hated noises.

299
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,820
She had never been close to him, though she
had liked his wife.

300
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,070
Maria was nice.

301
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,580
It was true that the old man had been a first
class designer but nobody is so good that

302
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:07,000
he can't be replaced - especially if they're
half crazy and more trouble than they're worth.

303
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,190
Besides, the company had already made a lot
of money from his designs.

304
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,870
There were plenty of excellent young designers
already applying for his job - they weren't

305
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,100
troubled by noise at all.

306
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,490
They were cheaper, too.

307
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:29,100
'No, there will be no problem replacing Arlo
Penton,' Eva thought to herself as she poured

308
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,110
out a second cup of coffee.

309
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:37,710
'No problem at all.'

310
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,300
Arlo had given up his job as soon as he .had
read the letter.

311
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,830
There was no way he was going to work in that
noisy factory!

312
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,160
He had enough money saved.

313
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,990
He could take care of himself all right.

314
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,840
He didn't need false friends who broke their
promises.

315
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,520
He could manage alone.

316
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,760
That's what he kept telling himself.

317
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,350
But it was a month since he had left his job
and die noises in Arlo's head were getting

318
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,890
worse.

319
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,830
He often forgot to take his pills now.

320
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,640
Sometimes he would wake up in the early hours
of the morning covered in sweat and screaming

321
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,750
at the ceiling.

322
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,600
Only now there was no Maria to help him get
over the nightmare.

323
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,560
His memories of the war had returned and he
was alone in the middle of them.

324
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,280
To Arlo, it seemed that the guns were firing
again.

325
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,870
The guns in his head and the sounds outside
were joining together.

326
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,420
The difference between memories and reality
was breaking down in his mind.

327
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,790
When he went out in the car for his groceries
he would hear the guns.

328
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:58,630
Every loud radio, every noisy machine seemed
like an exploding bomb to his ears.

329
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:04,100
He wondered why something wasn't done about
it but nothing ever was.

330
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,040
And all the time the noise was there.

331
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,120
Why didn't people notice what was going on?

332
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,470
Were they all deaf?

333
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,880
He could hear the enemy.

334
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,470
His enemy was noise.

335
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,460
He had to do something or he would go crazy.

336
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,080
Nobody else seemed to be doing a thing about
it.

337
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,330
It was all up to him.

338
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,810
He would have to stop the noise.

339
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,810
But how?

340
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:39,220
'That ought to be enough,' said Arlo.

341
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,010
It was one week later and he had decided what
he would do.

342
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,520
He had been making the tower he had next to
his house higher and stronger so that he could

343
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,990
increase the range of the radio signals to
his models.

344
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,320
He placed his electronic equipment on top
of the tower and the higher he built it the

345
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,830
better his electronic equipment worked.

346
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,600
He now had more control over his wonderful
models than ever before with a range that

347
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,970
allowed him to fly them high over the city.

348
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,260
Arlo had a wide variety of models to choose
from.

349
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,450
He had, over the years, collected over a hundred
models in his garage.

350
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,910
They were all in perfect working order.

351
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,850
Teckno- Toys had let him keep them.

352
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,090
He had tiny television cameras fitted to his
models.

353
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:38,280
This allowed him to see on his computer screen
indoors where his models were while they were

354
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,980
in use, even when it was cloudy or too hot
for him to go outside.

355
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,710
Arlo had learned a lot about how to make explosives
during the war.

356
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:56,020
He could attach a small but powerful explosive
onto a model and then, from the comfort of

357
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,900
his own home, direct it to a target.

358
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,640
The video cameras would show him exactly where
his target was; all he had to do was aim the

359
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,780
model (usually an aeroplane) towards the target
and BOOM!

360
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,260
- the target was destroyed.

361
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,020
Nobody suspected anything.

362
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,850
Arlo, after all, was just working on his models
like he always did.

363
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,790
No-one knew that he was making bombs as well.

364
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,430
Chico called by with more rats for Susie.

365
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:38,410
He saw Arlo working in his garage where Susie
lay sleeping in her glass-fronted box.

366
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,120
Chico liked Arlo, even if he didn't eat snakes.

367
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,910
He stopped to watch in admiration while Arlo
flew one of his wonderful models high into

368
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,910
the sky.

369
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:59,170
He had no idea that Arlo's campaign against
the enemy had begun.

370
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:06,450
Arlo's first bombing campaign was against
the old Tucson rock music radio station.

371
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,600
It was successful.

372
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,620
Just one small model aeroplane had delivered
enough home-made explosives to bring down

373
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,310
the radio station's tower.

374
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,110
It was easy.

375
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,750
They wouldn't be playing loud music from that
station for some while.

376
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,760
Tucson's local papers all published stories
about a strange explosion that had blown up

377
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,620
essential equipment at the local rock radio
station.

378
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,450
Nobody had been hurt in the explosion, they
said, but the station would be out of action

379
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,480
for a long time.

380
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,930
The police could see no motive for the crime
but did not reject the idea of some individual

381
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,470
playing around with explosives for fun.

382
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,890
This was worrying.

383
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,180
They were right to be worried.

384
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,470
Over the next week there were several more
explosions: large noisy machines on building

385
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,410
areas were destroyed and a fireworks factory
was seriously damaged.

386
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,950
But nobody had been hurt.

387
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,740
Not yet.

388
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,680
It was a few days after the explosion in the
fireworks factory and Sheriff Calhoun was

389
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,640
in the office of the Vice President of Teckno-Toys.

390
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,960
He badly wanted a cigarette.

391
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,760
He was trying to give up again and had not
brought any cigarettes with him.

392
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,460
Worse still, none of the other officers smoked
so he couldn't even get a cigarette from one

393
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,240
of them.

394
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,780
This was making him bad-tempered, but he had
a job to do.

395
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,660
He stuck another piece of chewing gum into
his mouth.

396
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,720
'Tell me again, Mr Dimaggio...'

397
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,260
The Sheriff paused as he softened the fresh
gum in his mouth.

398
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:01,880
'You told me when you rang me on the telephone
earlier that this guy - what was his name...?'

399
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,160
'Arlo Penton, Sheriff.'

400
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,390
'Yeah, Arlo Penton.

401
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,700
You said he had been one of the top designers
at Teckno-Toys?'

402
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,860
'The best we had.

403
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,200
That's him in that picture on the wall just
there.

404
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,890
He's the one holding the model Mustang fighter
plane.

405
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,000
That's our biggest selling model and he designed
it.'

406
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,490
Sheriff Calhoun looked at the picture in Bernie
Dimaggio's office.

407
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,300
Bernie liked to keep photographs of all of
Teckno-Toys' best toys with their designers.

408
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,240
Arlo featured in a lot of them.

409
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,650
In this one, Arlo was smiling and looked happy
and relaxed.

410
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,700
'And you got rid of the guy?' asked the Sheriff.

411
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,620
'No, Sheriff.

412
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,780
It was his choice.

413
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,980
He... er... left the company a few months
ago.'

414
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:55,160
The Sheriff recognised a note of guilt in
Bernie's voice.

415
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,350
Years of listening to countless interviews
had trained his ears to know when somebody

416
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,290
was trying to hide something.

417
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,520
That was what he was hearing now.

418
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,640
'With less than a year to go before he was
due to retire?

419
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,940
He sure must have had a reason.

420
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,060
Can you think of a reason, Mr Dimaggio?

421
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,000
After all, you say you've known him a long
time.

422
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,010
Not that I'm accusing anybody of anything,
you understand, but I have to ask these things.'

423
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,980
Bernie had felt bad about the way the promise
he and Diego had made to Arlo had been broken.

424
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,660
He felt bad about his own weakness before
Diego's daughter - his boss - who had not

425
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,200
respected that promise.

426
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,230
He knew that Arlo must have been disturbed
by the loss of The Havens but he hadn't been

427
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,540
brave enough to talk to Arlo about it after
he had given him the letter.

428
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:56,180
Could Arlo have used his expert skills to
make these explosions?

429
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:03,090
Bernie told the Sheriff everything about Arlo,
about Teckno-Toys and The Havens and how he

430
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,530
thought Arlo might be responsible for the
explosions.

431
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,950
Bernie felt glad to have finally told somebody
how he really felt about things.

432
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,520
'So, what will happen to Arlo now?'

433
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,700
Bernie asked.

434
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,180
'Now hold on, Mr Dimaggio.

435
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,020
You may have given us a motive for Mr Penton,
but we don't know that he did any of these

436
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
things.

437
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,830
There have been a number of explosions: at
the Tucson radio station, some heavy machines

438
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,180
blown up and the one a few nights ago at a
fireworks factory.

439
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,000
That caused serious damage.

440
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,170
But we can't be sure that any one person is
responsible for all of these crimes.

441
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,280
For all we know, there may be any number of
people out there making their own bombs.'

442
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,200
'But you don't really think so, do you Sheriff?'

443
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,220
Bernie asked.

444
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,760
Sheriff Calhoun took a few more thoughtful
chews of his gum and wished he had a cigarette.

445
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,940
He looked again at the photograph of Arlo.

446
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,420
Suddenly, he noticed a model aeroplane, like
a child's toy, fly past and before he could

447
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,770
reply, there was a loud BANG! from outside.

448
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,300
Bernie rushed to his window to look.

449
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,610
'Sheriff, it's the factory.

450
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,060
It's on fire!'

451
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,490
Arlo had been working hard.

452
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,150
He could not see the results of his work immediately
because the television cameras were destroyed

453
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,200
once his models hit their targets.

454
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,670
He had to listen to the radio for news of
his work - not the loud music stations, of

455
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,200
course.

456
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,520
His last action had been against the electrical
generator at the Teckno-Toys factory.

457
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,430
Without the generator they would not have
the power to work their loud machines, and

458
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:00,090
the hated factory noise would be silenced
at last.

459
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:07,460
Unfortunately, though the action had been
a success, three people had been badly burned.

460
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,950
He heard about them on the radio.

461
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,060
It upset him.

462
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,020
'But it's not my fault,' he told himself.

463
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,180
'This is war.

464
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,470
Every war hurts some innocent people.

465
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,900
It's the enemy's fault, not mine.

466
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,380
Once the enemy is defeated there will be peace.

467
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,110
I have to fight on for peace.

468
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,000
There's nobody else.

469
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,600
I have to.'

470
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,500
But Arlo had no peace.

471
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,210
His heart was saddened by the news of the
three injured people.

472
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,020
And the noises that disturbed him had not
been silenced.

473
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,140
The enemy was strong and there was much work
left to do.

474
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,340
He made his way to the garage again.

475
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,890
Arlo began working immediately.

476
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,490
He had to do the next one right.

477
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:07,080
He had no idea that the Sheriff and a large
number of police officers were, while he was

478
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,240
working, speeding towards his house in their
cars.

479
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,750
All he was concerned about was putting the
finishing touches to his model Mustang fighter

480
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,230
plane.

481
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:23,120
He had saved the Mustang for the new radio
tower they were building at the place where

482
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,720
The Havens used to be.

483
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,640
They would never finish it.

484
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,900
No way.

485
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,770
Not if he could help it.

486
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:36,470
It would not need much explosive, just enough
to bring the tower down.

487
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,010
That would be enough.

488
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,041
He got his little computer ready as he switched
on the video camera attached to the model

489
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,800
aeroplane.

490
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,600
It was time to fly.

491
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,340
Arlo placed the Mustang on the ground by his
garage then sat down by his controls.

492
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,450
He did not see the Sheriff's men, but they
saw him.

493
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,600
They had positioned themselves some distance
away from him.

494
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,840
They all had powerful guns.

495
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,690
They saw the Mustang as it started to take
off.

496
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,280
A shot was fired before the model had gone
far enough to leave the ground.

497
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,419
There was an explosion.

498
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:21,590
Arlo felt a force hit his ears and he was
knocked to the floor.

499
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,669
There was a pain in his arm.

500
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:26,470
He had closed his eyes.

501
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,570
Was he dead?

502
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,150
Had the enemy beaten him?

503
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,590
He opened his eyes and saw that his arm had
blood on it.

504
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:42,110
As he started to get himself up, Arlo did
not see the pieces of broken glass on the

505
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,270
floor behind him.

506
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:51,150
He did not notice the angry shaking sound
of the snake whose sleep had been disturbed.

507
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:56,369
He hardly felt Susie's bite before he sank
to the floor again.

508
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:04,000
His eyes felt heavy as the daylight turned
to darkness and death ran with the poison

509
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,500
in his blood.

510
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,190
But he was happy.

511
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,920
Arlo's world was, at last, a silent one.

512
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,210
- THE END -
