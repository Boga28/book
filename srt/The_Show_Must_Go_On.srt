CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,950
Hamlet comes to school

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:17,609
On the way to school one day, Fraser said
to Tom, 'Do you want to come and see Hamlet

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,880
at the City Theatre on Saturday afternoon?

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,300
My father is going to take me.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,220
He said you can come too.'

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,279
Tom Clark and Fraser McDonald were best friends.

8
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,050
They loved going to the theatre to see plays.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,620
They both wanted to be actors.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,850
They went to acting lessons in the city every
Monday afternoon.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,230
Fraser liked to dance too.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,850
He went to tap dancing classes every Saturday
afternoon.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,440
He loved the sound his tap dancing shoes made.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,120
Tom didn't learn tap dancing.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,090
He played football for the school every Saturday.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,220
'Hamlet is a play by William Shakespeare,'
said Fraser.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,549
'I know that,' said Tom.

18
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:13,340
'I want to play Hamlet one day.'

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:22,200
He jumped in front of Fraser and said in a
loud voice, 'To be or not to be, that is the

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
question!'

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,579
'Very good, Tom.

22
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,259
Do you want to come?'

23
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,990
'Yes, I'd love to see it.

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,229
Thanks!

25
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,229
Who's playing Hamlet?'

26
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,970
'Heath Mason!' said Fraser.

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,579
'Wow!' said Tom.

28
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:48,369
Heath Mason was an actor in a television show
called Here and Now.

29
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,940
He played a young doctor, Doctor Carson.

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,280
The boys watched the show every Monday night.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,329
'I really want to see Hamlet,' said Fraser.

32
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,189
'So I won't go to tap dancing class this Saturday.

33
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,890
My dancing teacher will understand.

34
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,020
She loves Heath Mason too!'

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,849
Tom stopped walking.

36
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,730
'Oh, no!'

37
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,560
'What?' asked Fraser.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,629
'I can't come to the play.

39
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,610
I have to play football on Saturday,' said
Tom.

40
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,050
'We have an afternoon game - against Riverdale
High.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,120
Mr Rankin won't understand.'

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,590
'Ask him, Tom.

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,390
You have to come!' said Fraser.

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,870
'I'll ask him at training after school today,'
said Tom.

45
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,300
'But he won't be happy.'

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,630
After football training that afternoon, Tom
said to his coach, 'Can I speak to you, please,

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,000
Mr Rankin?'

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,690
'What is it, Tom?'

49
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,129
Mr Rankin, the football coach, was a short
man with a red face.

50
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,650
He always yelled at the players.

51
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,340
'It's about the game on Saturday,' said Tom.

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,390
'What about it?' said Mr Rankin.

53
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,410
'I don't want to play in it, sir,' said Tom.

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,580
'What?

55
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,950
Why not?' yelled Mr Rankin.

56
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,810
'You are the best player I have.'

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,409
'Um - I want to go to the theatre.

58
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:37,440
Heath Mason is in Hamlet.'

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,180
'The theatre?

60
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,560
We're playing Riverdale on Saturday!'

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,230
Mr Rankin was angry.

62
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,950
'No, Tom.

63
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,700
We need you.

64
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,099
Forget about going to the theatre.'

65
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,540
Mr Rankin walked away.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:02,840
Gary Howard walked over to Tom and said, 'Listen,
Clark, you're not the best player.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,720
I am.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
But you be at that game on Saturday.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,170
Or I'll come and get you.'

70
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,010
Gary Howard was the biggest boy in the football
team.

71
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,630
He was strong.

72
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,750
He had very large hands.

73
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,169
He put a hand in front of Tom's face.

74
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,600
'Hello, Tom.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,169
Hello, Gary,' a voice said.

76
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,009
It was Fraser.

77
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,560
He stood next to Tom.

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,570
Gary put his hand down and said, 'Be there
on Saturday, Clark.

79
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,060
Or I'll find you.'

80
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,470
He walked away.

81
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,199
'What was that about?' asked Fraser.

82
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,370
'Mr Rankin said I was the best player.

83
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,169
Gary heard him.'

84
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,430
'Oh,' said Fraser.

85
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,389
'Gary did look angry!

86
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,479
Can you come and see Hamlet?'

87
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,860
'No,' said Tom.

88
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,360
'I'm in the team.

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,740
I have to play football on Saturday, Fraser.'

90
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,890
At lunchtime the next day, Fraser came running
to Tom.

91
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,890
'Tom!

92
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,430
He's here at our school!

93
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,560
Hamlet's here!'

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,310
'Who's here?'

95
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,060
asked Tom.

96
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,810
'Heath Mason.

97
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,889
I saw him talking to the teachers.'

98
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,160
'Heath Mason - here?

99
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,520
Where is he?'

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,009
The boys hurried through the school.

101
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,620
'There he is!'

102
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,640
yelled Fraser.

103
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,770
'At the school hall.

104
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,889
He's going into the school hall!'

105
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,740
Tom and Fraser ran into the hall.

106
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,020
The boys looked for the actor, but they couldn't
see him.

107
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,250
'It's empty,' said Tom.

108
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,889
'Did you really see him?'

109
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,970
'I did,' said Fraser.

110
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,990
'It was him.'

111
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,139
They went up onto the stage.

112
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:13,210
'Hey, Fraser, you be Hamlet and I'll be the
king,' said Tom.

113
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:21,310
'Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from
me!'

114
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,289
Just then, Heath Mason walked onto the stage.

115
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,410
'Hello,' he said.

116
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,889
'That's very good.'

117
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,819
The boys looked at him.

118
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,900
'I'm Heath,' he said.

119
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,330
'I know!' said Tom.

120
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,759
'You're Heath Mason!'

121
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,430
Heath Mason smiled and walked across to the
boys.

122
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,060
'Who are you?' he asked.

123
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,030
'Er, I'm Tom and this is Fraser.

124
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,690
But what are you doing here?'

125
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,000
'I'm an old boy of this school,' said Heath.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,110
'You are?' said Tom.

127
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,150
'Yes.

128
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,080
I was a student here.

129
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,430
I left twelve years ago.

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,720
I acted in my first play here on this stage.'

131
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,879
'Fraser and I love acting,' said Tom.

132
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,530
'But the school doesn't put on plays now.'

133
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,390
'That's sad,' said Heath.

134
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,430
'My English teacher, Miss Piper, put on the
school plays then.

135
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,940
Does she teach here now?' he asked.

136
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,220
'No.

137
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,270
Fraser and I go to an acting school in the
city,' said Tom.

138
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,270
'We put on plays there.'

139
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,930
'I'm coming to see you in Hamlet on Saturday,'
said Fraser.

140
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,389
'Good!

141
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,550
Are you coming too, Tom?' asked Heath.

142
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,490
'I want to, but I can't.

143
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,940
I have to play football.'

144
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,229
'Mr Rankin was my football coach,' said Heath.

145
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,110
'Does he teach here now?'

146
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,590
'Yes,' said Tom.

147
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,210
'He's my coach too.'

148
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,550
'He loves football, doesn't he?' smiled Heath.

149
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,320
Just then, some teachers came into the hall.

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,770
The school principal, Mr Barton, was with
them.

151
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,720
He walked up to the stage and said, 'Ah, there
you are, Heath.

152
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,590
We didn't know where you were.'

153
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,599
'I just wanted to come and look at the hall.

154
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,029
I love this place.

155
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,089
I did some plays here,' Heath told Mr Barton.

156
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,060
'Ah yes,' said Mr Barton.

157
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,890
'That was before my time here.'

158
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,120
Tom saw Mr Rankin at the back of the hall.

159
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,930
Heath saw him too.

160
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,710
'Hello, Mr Rankin,' he called.

161
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,670
'Hello, Heath,' said Mr Rankin.

162
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,160
He walked up to the stage.

163
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,970
'Tom can't see my play on Saturday because
he has to play football,' said Heath.

164
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,690
'Can't he come to my play?'

165
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,470
'No, he can't,' said Mr Rankin.

166
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,040
'We need him.

167
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,980
We're playing Riverdale.

168
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,220
It's the biggest game of the year.

169
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,550
You played in the team when you were a student
here, Heath.

170
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,370
You know Tom has to play on Saturday.'

171
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,380
Heath looked at Tom.

172
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,050
'Mr Rankin's right.

173
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,540
You should play football on Saturday, Tom.

174
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,240
Come and see my next play.'

175
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,960
Mr Barton said, 'Boys, go to class.

176
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,890
Mr Mason will be talking to the school soon.'

177
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,209
'Goodbye, Heath,' said Fraser.

178
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,310
'Thanks for asking about Saturday,' said Tom.

179
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,600
'Nice to meet you.'

180
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,650
'Goodbye, Tom.

181
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,550
Goodbye, Fraser,' said Heath.

182
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,540
Outside, Fraser said, 'Wow!

183
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,149
We met Heath Mason!'

184
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,589
'But why is he here?'

185
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:16,970
asked Tom.

186
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,750
'I don't know,' said Fraser.

187
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,140
In the afternoon, all the classes had to go
to the hall.

188
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,180
Tom and Fraser went with their English class.

189
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,760
This time, the hall was full of students and
teachers.

190
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,639
Mr Barton walked onto the stage.

191
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,780
'Today we have a visitor.

192
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,100
He is an old boy of the school.

193
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,839
He was a student here before any of you came
here.

194
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,899
But you all know him.

195
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:55,310
Here he is - Mr Heath Mason.'

196
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,500
All the students started talking.

197
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,019
Then Heath walked onto the stage and there
was a lot of cheering and clapping.

198
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,339
Some students stood up.

199
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,040
Teachers yelled at the students to sit down
and be quiet.

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,300
Then Heath smiled and raised his hands and
all the students sat quietly.

201
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,100
'Thank you, Mr Barton,' said Heath.

202
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,829
'Good afternoon, boys.

203
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:25,280
It's nice to be back at my old school.

204
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm here to talk about being an actor.

205
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,959
It's not an easy job, but I love it.

206
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,500
I started acting here on this stage when I
was fifteen.

207
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,680
And now I want you to act on this stage too.'

208
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,590
Tom looked at Fraser.

209
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,580
What was Heath going to say next?

210
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,620
'I've spoken to Mr Barton about this.

211
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,839
I want some of you to try acting.

212
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,000
So there is going to be a play competition.

213
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,720
There will be prizes for the best play and
the best actor.

214
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,329
I will come back here five weeks from now.

215
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,760
I'll watch the plays that you put on.

216
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,140
The group that puts on the best play in the
competition will come to the first night of

217
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,210
my next play at the City Theatre in November.

218
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,850
I'll be doing Shakespeare's As You Like It.

219
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,240
You can come and meet the other actors in
the play.

220
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,511
And the best actor in the competition will
be on my television show, Here and Now, for

221
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:32,240
a day.

222
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,970
One boy from this school will play my little
brother!'

223
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,490
There was a lot of noise from the students.

224
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,800
'That will be me,' said Tom quietly.

225
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,190
'That will be me,' said Fraser quietly.

226
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,880
Both boys wanted that prize.

227
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:05,390
But only one boy could win the competition.

228
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,680
CHAPTER TWO

229
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,889
We can't do that!

230
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,570
Tom and Fraser were very excited about the
competition.

231
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:20,600
'We need to find a good play to put on,' said
Tom on the way home from school.

232
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,870
'Yes.

233
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,639
The library was full of boys after school,'
said Fraser.

234
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,640
'They were all looking for books of plays.'

235
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,940
'The library doesn't have many plays,' said
Tom.

236
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,300
'Tom!

237
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,660
Fraser!

238
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,060
Wait for us!'

239
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,829
called a boy with long black hair.

240
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,310
It was their friend, Luke Reed.

241
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,790
Luke was with Anton Mitchell.

242
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,660
All four boys were good friends.

243
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,920
Tom and Fraser waited for Luke and Anton.

244
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Then the four boys walked along the street.

245
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,820
'So, what play are we going to do?' asked
Luke.

246
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,480
'We?' said Tom.

247
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,380
'But you don't like plays, Luke.'

248
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,649
'Yes, I do,' said Luke.

249
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,330
'Don't look so surprised.

250
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,910
It'll be fun.'

251
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,670
'Luke wants to win the competition.

252
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,370
He wants to go on television,' said Anton.

253
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,050
'I don't.

254
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,620
But I do want to be in a play.'

255
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,470
'But Anton, you and Luke have never done any
acting,' said Fraser.

256
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,430
'It's not easy.'

257
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,130
'You can teach us,' said Anton.

258
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,040
'What kind of play shall we do?'

259
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,310
'We can do any kind of play.

260
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,760
It can be funny or sad,' said Tom.

261
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,080
'It must be no longer than fifteen minutes.'

262
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,750
'Let's do a funny play,' said Luke.

263
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,550
'I like to make people laugh.'

264
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,460
'Me too,' said Fraser.

265
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,160
'But maybe Heath Mason likes sad plays.

266
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,449
He is doing Hamlet.'

267
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,120
'We should do the play that is right for us,'
said Anton.

268
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,839
'You're right, Anton,' said Tom.

269
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,540
'We have to find the right play.

270
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,470
Let's all look for one and meet at my house
after school on Friday.

271
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,620
Everyone bring one play.'

272
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,230
'I'll go to the bookshop,' said Fraser.

273
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,139
'Good,' said Tom.

274
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,949
'And I'll visit my grandfather.

275
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,290
He has a lot of books.

276
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,180
Maybe he has some books of plays.'

277
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,620
The group met on Friday.

278
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,550
'You go first, Luke,' said Tom.

279
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,190
'Did you find a play?'

280
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,190
'Yes.

281
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,019
I brought this book,' said Luke.

282
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,480
He showed it to the group.

283
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,779
'It has some very funny plays in it.

284
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,440
I like this one the best - Monkey Man.

285
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,380
It's about a man who can turn people into
monkeys.'

286
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,310
'I don't want to be a monkey in front of the
school,' said Anton.

287
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,959
'Oo-oo-ooh!'

288
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,160
Luke made loud monkey noises and started jumping
about.

289
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,860
Fraser laughed and jumped about too.

290
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,199
They made louder and louder monkey noises.

291
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,699
'Quiet, you two!'

292
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,060
yelled Tom.

293
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,860
He was looking at Luke's book.

294
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,269
'Luke, Monkey Man has ten people in it.

295
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:34,310
There are only four of us.'

296
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,870
'And I don't want to be a monkey on stage!'
said Anton.

297
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,569
'So what did you find, Anton?'

298
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,060
asked Luke.

299
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,620
Anton showed them a book of plays by William
Shakespeare.

300
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,090
'I really like these.'

301
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,269
'And Heath Mason likes Shakespeare too,' said
Fraser.

302
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:59,980
'But his plays are much too long.

303
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,150
And they have a lot more people than Monkey
Man.'

304
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,049
'Monkey man!

305
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:06,049
Oo-oo-ooh!'

306
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,140
yelled Luke.

307
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,100
He jumped up again.

308
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,260
'Quiet, Luke!'

309
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,959
yelled Anton.

310
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,870
He opened the book.

311
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,300
'Look.

312
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,150
This is Romeo and Juliet.

313
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,970
We don't have to do all the play.

314
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,060
We can just do these pages here.

315
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,539
It's when Romeo is in a fight.'

316
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,120
'I'll be Romeo!'

317
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,280
yelled Luke.

318
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,670
'I'll fight you!'

319
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,450
yelled Fraser.

320
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,059
The two boys ran around the living room.

321
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,490
'Stop it!'

322
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,980
yelled Tom.

323
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,730
Then he said, 'I like Romeo and Juliet too,
Anton.

324
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,530
But maybe it's too hard for us.

325
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,850
And I want to do something new.

326
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,320
What did you find, Fraser?'

327
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,720
'I've got one called Taylor, Taylor,' said
Fraser.

328
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,159
'It's new.

329
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,890
It's about a boy and a girl who have the same
name.'

330
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,950
'I don't want to be a girl in front of the
school,' said Anton.

331
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,740
'It's better than being a monkey,' said Fraser.

332
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,820
'Monkey man!'

333
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,809
yelled Luke, and he jumped up again.

334
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,040
'Quiet!' said Tom.

335
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,190
'I went to see my grandfather.

336
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,669
We looked at a lot of plays.

337
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:30,650
But they were all too long or they had too
many people in them.'

338
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,900
'So you don't have a play to show us?' said
Anton.

339
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,549
'No,' said Tom.

340
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,700
'Okay, we'll do Monkey Man, then,' said Luke.

341
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
'Oo-oo-ooh!'

342
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
'No.

343
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,299
I'm not doing that play,' said Anton.

344
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,440
'Let's do Romeo and...'

345
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,300
'No,' said Fraser.

346
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,390
'No Shakespeare.'

347
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:02,070
'And I don't want to be a girl in Fraser's
play,' said Luke.

348
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,580
Everyone in the group started yelling.

349
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,110
'My play!'...'No, my play!'...'Monkey Man!'..."We
can't do that!'

350
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,520
'QUIET!'

351
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,000
yelled Tom.

352
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,740
'You don't even have a play,' said Luke angrily.

353
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,780
'No, but listen,' said Tom.

354
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,910
'We want to do a new play, right?

355
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,170
So let's write a play.'

356
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,460
The group looked at Tom.

357
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,100
'Fraser and I have written short plays at
our acting school,' he said.

358
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,650
Fraser smiled.

359
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,929
'My play was bad.

360
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:46,299
I can dance and act but I can't write.

361
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,620
But you write well, Tom.

362
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,940
Your play was very good.'

363
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,570
'Let's do that one,' said Anton.

364
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,100
'We can't.

365
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,140
It has twelve people in it.

366
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,809
I wrote it for our acting class,' said Tom.

367
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,230
'But I can write a new one.

368
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,539
I'll write a play for four people, just for
us.'

369
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,610
'We don't have much time,' said Anton.

370
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,270
'The competition is only a month away.'

371
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,549
'You can do it, Tom,' said Fraser.

372
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,840
'You'll write a really good play.'

373
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,299
'What will it be about?' asked Anton.

374
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,770
'I don't know yet,' said Tom.

375
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,100
'I want a play with tap dancing in it,' said
Fraser.

376
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,490
'And drums!' said Luke.

377
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,100
'I want to play drums!'

378
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,320
'Let's meet here again on Sunday,' said Tom.

379
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:53,710
'I'll tell you what the play will be about
then.'

380
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,320
CHAPTER THREE

381
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
Finding the story

382
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,070
The next day was Saturday, the day of the
big game against Riverdale.

383
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,720
Luke and Anton came to watch the game.

384
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,299
Fraser went to see Heath Mason in Hamlet.

385
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:14,490
'How is the writing going, Tom?

386
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,350
What's your idea for the play?' asked Luke
before the game.

387
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,809
'Have you written it yet?' asked Anton.

388
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:26,590
'I haven't had time to do any writing,' said
Tom.

389
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,279
Tom didn't know what to write about yet.

390
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,330
He had no idea.

391
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,730
He wanted to write a really good play and
win the competition.

392
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,289
But he didn't know what to do.

393
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:39,970
It was hard.

394
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,010
He hadn't slept much.

395
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,740
He was very tired.

396
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,919
Mr Rankin came across the football field.

397
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,630
'Tom!' he yelled.

398
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,700
'The Riverdale team is here already.

399
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,190
Get out on the field and play hard.

400
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,600
We must win this game!'

401
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,380
Anton and Luke watched the game.

402
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,860
'Come on, Tom,' they yelled.

403
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,360
'You can do it!'

404
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,700
But Tom played very badly.

405
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,390
He was too tired.

406
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,140
Gary Howard ran up to him on the field.

407
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,380
'You're the worst player, Clark!' he said.

408
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,090
'A girl can kick better than you.'

409
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,800
Tom said nothing.

410
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,270
Gary was right.

411
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,420
He was playing very badly.

412
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,720
'Here comes the ball!' said Gary.

413
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,049
He ran after the ball and kicked it hard.

414
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,570
'Yes!' he yelled and jumped in the air.

415
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,960
Gary was playing well.

416
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,909
Mr Rankin yelled from the side of the field.

417
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,679
'Tom Clark, come off the field now!'

418
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,780
Mr Rankin told another boy to play.

419
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,600
Tom walked slowly off the field.

420
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,580
Mr Rankin yelled at him, 'What's wrong with
you?

421
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,740
Are you ill?'

422
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,600
'No, sir,' said Tom.

423
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,010
Tom's team won the game.

424
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,570
But Mr Rankin wasn't happy.

425
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,770
'We have three more games this year.

426
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,299
We must win them all,' he said to them.

427
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,809
'Tom, you played very badly today.

428
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,970
The team needs you to play well.

429
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,029
Gary, you were the best player today.

430
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:35,289
But every boy in this team must play better.

431
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,900
I want to win!'

432
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,980
When Tom was unhappy, he often visited his
grandfather.

433
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,410
'Hello, Granddad,' said Tom.

434
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,190
'Hello, Tom.

435
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,090
What's wrong?'

436
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,529
Tom told his grandfather about the football
game.

437
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,780
And about what Mr Rankin said.

438
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,720
'We all have good days and bad days, Tom,'
said his grandfather.

439
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,049
'You'll play better next time.

440
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,090
Forget it.

441
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,260
Let's talk about your play.

442
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,400
How's it going?'

443
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,559
'Not very well.

444
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,130
I can't think of a story,' said Tom.

445
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:23,059
'When I want to find a good story, I read
this,' said his grandfather.

446
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,440
'It's full of good ideas.'

447
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,240
Tom's grandfather gave Tom a big old book.

448
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,760
'Stories from Old Greece,' Tom read.

449
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,220
'You'll find a good story in there,' said
Tom's grandfather.

450
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,730
'Thanks, Granddad,' said Tom.

451
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,040
Tom took the book home and read it that night.

452
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:55,140
In the morning, he had an idea for the new
play.

453
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,279
On Sunday, the group met at Tom's house.

454
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,180
'Heath Mason was a really good Hamlet,' said
Fraser.

455
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,270
'And I loved the fight at the end of the play!'

456
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,600
Fraser jumped up.

457
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,050
He showed his friends some of the fight.

458
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,029
'Okay, Fraser,' said Tom.

459
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:16,010
'We have to get on with our play now.

460
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,390
We only have a month.'

461
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,140
'What play are we doing, Tom?' asked Luke.

462
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:29,809
Tom smiled and said, 'I'm writing a play called
Fire Light.

463
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,350
It's about a man called Prometheus.'

464
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,610
'Proth...

465
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,950
Who?' said Luke.

466
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,450
'I know the story of Prometheus,' said Anton.

467
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,549
'He gave fire to men, didn't he?'

468
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,650
'Yes,' said Tom.

469
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,990
'I read the story in a book last night.

470
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,760
Prometheus made men out of clay.'

471
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,799
'Clay?' said Luke.

472
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,100
'My mum makes flower pots out of clay.

473
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,540
She makes coffee cups out of clay too.

474
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,590
But making men out of clay?'

475
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,700
'It's an old story, Luke,' said Tom.

476
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,990
'A Greek myth.'

477
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,360
'Okay.

478
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,720
So in this myth, Prometheus made men out of
clay.

479
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,360
Is that what the play is about?'

480
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,409
'Wait and listen, Luke,' said Tom.

481
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:30,620
'Prometheus made men out of clay and he taught
them a lot of things.

482
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,289
He taught them to grow food and he taught
them to fight.'

483
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:36,140
'To fight?

484
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,860
Can we have fighting in the play?' asked Luke.

485
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,960
'Maybe,' said Tom.

486
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,950
'But that's not the end of the story.

487
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,240
The men didn't have fire.

488
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,409
Zeus, the king of the gods, didn't like men.

489
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,250
Zeus didn't want them to have fire.

490
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,370
But Prometheus wanted to give fire to his
men.

491
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,140
So he went to the place where the gods did
their cooking.

492
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,100
He took some fire.

493
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,260
He stole fire from the gods.

494
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,770
But Zeus wanted a world without fire.

495
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,820
So Zeus was very angry with Prometheus.'

496
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,010
'Do they fight?' asked Luke.

497
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,950
'Be quiet, Luke,' said Anton.

498
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,760
'I really like this myth, Tom.

499
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,460
It will make a good play.'

500
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,169
'We have a lot of work to do,' said Tom.

501
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:33,480
'Are you guys all happy to do this story?'

502
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,760
'Yes!' they all said.

503
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,540
'Then let's get to work.

504
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,769
And can you all come here after school on
Tuesday?

505
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,770
We'll need to work hard on this play,' Tom
said.

506
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,790
'We'll need to rehearse a lot.'

507
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:53,740
'We'll need to do what?' asked Luke.

508
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,900
'Rehearse.

509
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,440
We'll need to do the play again and again
to get it right.'

510
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,120
'We mustn't tell any other boys about this,'
said Anton.

511
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,269
'We don't want another group to steal our
idea.'

512
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:12,090
'Anton is right,' said Fraser.

513
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,470
'We mustn't talk about this to the other groups.'

514
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,049
'On with the show!' said Luke.

515
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,990
'I want to be Prometheus.'

516
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,020
'No, I want to be Prometheus!' said Fraser.

517
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,980
'It's my idea,' said Tom.

518
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,700
'So I'm going to be Prometheus.'

519
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,230
'Quiet!'

520
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,050
yelled Anton.

521
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,409
'Don't fight or we won't have a show!'

522
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:41,870
'I'm going home,' said Fraser.

523
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,029
'Me too,' said Luke.

524
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,210
They left.

525
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,500
'Oh well, I'll go too,' said Anton.

526
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,279
'I like your idea, Tom.

527
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,530
And I don't want to be Prometheus.

528
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,870
I just want to be in the play.'

529
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,220
'Thanks, Anton,' said Tom.

530
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,100
Tom needed Fraser and Luke to do his play.

531
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,390
Without them, there was no group and no play.

532
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,840
That night, he phoned Fraser.

533
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,169
'Hi, Fraser,' Tom said.

534
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,289
'Listen, you can be Prometheus.

535
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,789
You're the best actor in our group.

536
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,159
And you can dance.

537
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,039
I'm the writer and I want Prometheus to dance
in our show.

538
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,640
Luke can be Zeus.

539
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,980
He'll be the king of the gods.

540
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,410
And Zeus can play drums.

541
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,950
Luke will like that idea.

542
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,950
Anton and I can be the other people in the
play.'

543
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,100
'Really?

544
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,539
Thanks, Tom,' said Fraser.

545
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:53,360
'But then you won't win the best actor prize.

546
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,090
You won't do much acting.'

547
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,730
'But I'll write the play.

548
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,309
Maybe it will win the prize for the best play.'

549
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:02,779
'It will.

550
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,850
I know it will,' said Fraser.

551
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,769
Tom phoned Luke next.

552
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,870
Luke liked the idea of being Zeus.

553
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,590
He loved the idea of playing the drums.

554
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,740
Then Tom phoned Anton.

555
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,019
'Hi, Anton,' he said.

556
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,299
'It's going to be okay.

557
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,400
Luke and Fraser are happy now.

558
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,740
I am too.

559
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:37,019
The show can go on.'

560
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:38,019
CHAPTER FOUR

561
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,549
Losing a man

562
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,960
The group worked hard for the next two weeks.

563
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,440
Tom wrote the play very quickly.

564
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,610
The boys all learnt their words.

565
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,110
They had a lot of fun.

566
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,210
Tom tried hard at football too.

567
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,100
One day Mr Rankin said, 'Well done, Tom.

568
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,909
You're playing very well.'

569
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:09,019
Gary came close to Tom and said, 'I'm better
than you.

570
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,240
You're hopeless.'

571
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,409
Then he hit Tom on the arm.

572
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:17,519
'I saw that, Gary Howard!'

573
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,529
yelled Mr Rankin.

574
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,779
'Don't hit other players.

575
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,639
Do you understand?'

576
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:27,870
'Yes, sir,' said Gary.

577
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:33,950
Then he said quietly to Tom, 'Why do you play
football, Clark?

578
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,090
You're always doing your acting.

579
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,450
Footballers should just play football.'

580
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,899
'I can do both.'

581
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,639
'Oh yeah?

582
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,039
Your group's play is hopeless,' said Gary.

583
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,450
'It's not hopeless,' said Tom.

584
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,870
'We're going to win.'

585
00:31:52,870 --> 00:32:00,190
'All plays are hopeless,' said Gary and he
walked away.

586
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,960
Tom watched him go.

587
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,799
The group rehearsed often - some days in a
classroom after school, some days at Tom's

588
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,570
house.

589
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,950
Fraser worked hard on the tap dance for Prometheus.

590
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,480
Luke loved playing the drums when he walked
onto the stage.

591
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,720
Tom and Anton were the men of clay.

592
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
Anton and his mother made the costumes for
the play.

593
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,740
Luke liked his costume - Zeus wore a big purple
coat.

594
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,059
Anton made masks for the group.

595
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:37,970
The masks went over the top half of their
faces.

596
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,730
The boys could wear their masks and say their
words.

597
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,400
The mask for Zeus was golden.

598
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,370
The mask for Prometheus was white.

599
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,890
The masks for the men of clay were brown.

600
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,549
'I like my golden mask,' said Luke.

601
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:58,040
'The sun is golden.

602
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,899
So is Zeus.

603
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:03,720
I'm the king of the gods!'

604
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,279
Then one Wednesday, Anton didn't come to school.

605
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,019
That afternoon, the phone rang at Tom's house.

606
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,940
Tom answered it.

607
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,250
'It's Mrs Mitchell here, Tom - Anton's mother.'

608
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,940
'Hello, Mrs Mitchell.

609
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,539
How are you?'

610
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:26,480
'I'm fine, but Anton is sick.

611
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,139
He's got glandular fever.'

612
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:32,720
'Oh, no!' said Tom.

613
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,150
'Yes.

614
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:40,039
He was very tired last night and this morning
he was really sick.

615
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:44,799
We went to the doctor and he said it was glandular
fever.'

616
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,549
'Will he be okay?'

617
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:52,480
'Yes, but he has to stay home from school
for a few weeks.

618
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,880
He wanted me to phone you, because he won't
be able to be in your play.

619
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,380
It's sad - he really wanted to be in it.'

620
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,210
'That's really bad news.

621
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,700
I hope he gets better soon,' said Tom.

622
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:15,090
'Oh, Mrs Mitchell, the costumes and masks
- Anton has them.'

623
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,240
'Oh yes, that's right.

624
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,329
I'll get them to you over the weekend.

625
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:23,250
Is that all right?'

626
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,250
'Yes.

627
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,369
That will be fine,' said Tom.

628
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:29,190
'Thanks, Mrs Mitchell.

629
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,570
And I'm sorry about Anton.'

630
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:38,629
Tom told Luke and Fraser the bad news the
next day.

631
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,960
'Maybe we can find another boy to be in our
play,' said Luke.

632
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,899
'But who?' said Fraser.

633
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:49,109
'Everyone's in a play already.'

634
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:53,169
'Maybe we'll have to make a boy out of clay!'
said Luke.

635
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:54,730
'Ha, ha.

636
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,950
Not funny,' said Fraser.

637
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,430
'There's no time to write the play again,'
said Tom.

638
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,190
'I know,' said Fraser.

639
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,680
'The competition is at the end of next week.'

640
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,620
'And my last football game is only two days
away,' said Tom.

641
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,610
'I need to get some sleep tonight.'

642
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:22,450
At football training that afternoon, Tom tried
to forget about the play.

643
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,150
He tried to forget about Anton.

644
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,320
He tried to kick the ball well.

645
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,550
Gary Howard kept running in front of Tom.

646
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,750
Tom fell over.

647
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,860
'Get up, Tom,' yelled Mr Rankin.

648
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,599
'It's not time for bed yet.'

649
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:41,820
The team laughed.

650
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,440
Gary laughed the loudest.

651
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,270
'Maybe he's tired, sir,' said Gary.

652
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,690
'Maybe he's too tired to be in the game on
Saturday.

653
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,520
He's been doing his play all the time.'

654
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,660
'I don't want to hear any more about those
plays.

655
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,450
We're here to play football,' said Mr Rankin.

656
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:10,490
'Now boys, one of you will have to watch the
game on Saturday.

657
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,230
We have too many players.

658
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,990
So one of you won't play.

659
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,920
Think about that.

660
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,630
Okay, back to work.

661
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,770
I want to see fifteen more minutes of hard
football before we finish today.'

662
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,740
The boys played again.

663
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,030
Gary stood near Tom and the ball came towards
them.

664
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,460
Tom kicked it, but then Gary hit Tom.

665
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,240
'Right, that's it!'

666
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
yelled Mr Rankin.

667
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,240
'I've told you before, Gary Howard no hitting.

668
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,710
You're out of the team for Saturday.'

669
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,410
'What?' said Gary.

670
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,390
'But I'm the best player, sir.'

671
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,060
'Not another word, boy,' said Mr Rankin.

672
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,730
'You're not going to play.'

673
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,780
'Oh, sir...' said some of the other boys.

674
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,430
Tom said, 'Can I play half the game, sir?

675
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,800
Then Gary can play the other half.'

676
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,030
'No, Tom.

677
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:16,599
Gary can sit and watch,' said Mr Rankin and
he walked away.

678
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,160
Gary was very angry.

679
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:26,130
'I don't need your help, Clark,' he said to
Tom in a nasty voice.

680
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,329
Anton phoned Tom on Friday evening.

681
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,810
'How are you?' asked Tom.

682
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,930
'Not good,' said Anton.

683
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,110
'Glandular fever is no fun.

684
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm really tired all the time.

685
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,940
Listen, I'm sorry about the play.'

686
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,430
'That's okay, Anton.'

687
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,220
'And good luck in the football game tomorrow.

688
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,210
My mum will bring the costumes and masks to
you then.

689
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,440
Okay?'

690
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,230
'Okay,' said Tom.

691
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,130
'You just get better.'

692
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,230
'I'll try.

693
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,760
Maybe I'll be a little better by the end of
next week.

694
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,710
Then I'll be able to come and see the play.

695
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,720
I'd like to see my costumes and masks on the
stage.

696
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,880
And I'd like to see you guys win the competition.'

697
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,859
The day of the last football game was cold
and wet.

698
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:25,050
Luke and Fraser came to watch the game.

699
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,560
Most of the school came to watch.

700
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,520
Gary Howard was there.

701
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,400
He was not happy.

702
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,550
He didn't want to sit on the side.

703
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,210
The first half of the game was hard.

704
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,770
The other team was very good.

705
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,360
Tom had to play his very best football.

706
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,830
He was tired and cold and wet.

707
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,900
It was hard to play in the rain.

708
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:56,130
'Please can I play now, Mr Rankin?' asked
Gary after the first half.

709
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,330
'No,' said Mr Rankin.

710
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,740
'The team's playing well without you.'

711
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,220
Gary looked very sad.

712
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,640
'Okay, boys, I want a good, hard, fast second
half.

713
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,590
Go out there and win!' said Mr Rankin.

714
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,099
They did win.

715
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:18,170
There was a lot of cheering.

716
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,050
But not from Gary.

717
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,280
He went up to Tom.

718
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,050
'I should have played today, Clark, not you.'

719
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,550
Luke and Fraser ran up to Tom and yelled,
'You won!

720
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,780
You won!

721
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,050
You were great!'

722
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,480
'Thanks, guys,' said Tom.

723
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,670
'Well done, Tom!' said Mrs Mitchell.

724
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,410
She was carrying a big bag.

725
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,119
'Here are the costumes and masks,' she said.

726
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,819
'Good luck with the play, boys.'

727
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,530
'Thanks, Mrs Mitchell,' said Tom.

728
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,490
'Say hello to Anton for us.'

729
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,480
Luke and Fraser left, and Tom carried the
bag to the changing room at the side of the

730
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,490
field.

731
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,150
The boys in Tom's team were all in the changing
room.

732
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,110
Tom put the bag down and got changed.

733
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:14,619
He took off his wet football clothes and he
put on some warm, dry clothes.

734
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,160
'We won!

735
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,560
We won!'

736
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,580
yelled the boys in the team.

737
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,040
There was a lot of noise - yelling and singing
and laughter.

738
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,930
Mr Rankin had a big smile on his face.

739
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:32,780
Half an hour later, most of the boys were
leaving the changing room.

740
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,589
It was time for Tom to go home too.

741
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:37,770
He looked for the big bag.

742
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,530
He looked under all the seats in the changing
room.

743
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,150
The bag was gone!

744
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,390
Where could it be?

745
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,849
Suddenly, Tom knew.

746
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:53,190
He went to an old house at the far end of
town.

747
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,339
There were some old broken chairs outside
the front door.

748
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:00,270
A fat man with no hair was sitting there.

749
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,640
His clothes were dirty.

750
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,440
'Hello... um...

751
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,460
Mr Howard?'

752
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,070
'What do you want?'

753
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,310
the man said in a nasty voice.

754
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,800
'Is Gary home?' asked Tom.

755
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,940
'Who are you?'

756
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,700
'I'm Tom Clark.

757
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
I'm...

758
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,560
I go to school with Gary.'

759
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,040
'His room's at the back,' said Mr Howard.

760
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,570
'Go in.'

761
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,790
Tom went inside.

762
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,350
The house was dark.

763
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,540
He walked to the back of the house and looked
in a bedroom.

764
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,740
Gary was there and the bag of costumes was
at his feet.

765
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:49,720
He was wearing the golden mask and the purple
coat and looking at himself in a mirror.

766
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,930
He didn't see Tom.

767
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,440
Tom didn't say a word.

768
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,640
Then Gary saw him.

769
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,609
He quickly took off the mask and coat and
threw them across the room.

770
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:04,839
'What are you doing here?' he shouted.

771
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,660
'Get out!'

772
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,890
His face was red.

773
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,990
'You took our costumes and masks,' said Tom.

774
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,380
'Why?'

775
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,980
Gary didn't reply.

776
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,260
'Why did you take them, Gary?'

777
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,250
Then Gary spoke in a quiet voice.

778
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,181
'You want to do everything, don't you?

779
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:35,380
You play football and... and you do your plays
and you...

780
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,640
Just take your stupid things and get out!'

781
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,099
He turned away from Tom.

782
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:47,440
Tom was angry but then he heard Gary make
a noise.

783
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,750
Was he crying?

784
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,089
'Gary,' said Tom.

785
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:54,349
He had an idea.

786
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:56,250
'Gary, wait.

787
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,920
Would you like to be in our play?'

788
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,190
'What?' said Gary.

789
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,599
He turned and looked at Tom.

790
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,210
His eyes were wet.

791
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,180
'Would you like to be in our play?'

792
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,160
Tom said again.

793
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,859
'Me?

794
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,740
In your play?

795
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,000
Don't be stupid!'

796
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,530
'But we need you.

797
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,030
Anton can't do it.

798
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,030
He's sick.

799
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,099
We need another actor.

800
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:29,099
Please, Gary.'

801
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,970
'No,' said Gary.

802
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,240
'I don't want to.'

803
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,410
'Please, Gary,' Tom said again.

804
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,330
'It'll be fun.

805
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,470
There's fire in it.

806
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,650
And drums.'

807
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,290
Gary didn't speak for a long time.

808
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:58,130
Then he said, 'Okay.'

809
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,050
CHAPTER FIVE

00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,050
Fire Light

811
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,500
'What?' yelled Fraser.

812
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,180
'You asked Gary Howard?' said Luke.

813
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,200
'Why?'

814
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,240
asked Fraser.

815
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,270
Tom looked at Luke and Fraser.

816
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,330
'Gary isn't in another play.

817
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,440
And he really wants to be in our play.

818
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,190
We have one week to go and we need him.

819
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,410
Come on, guys.

820
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,589
Let's try doing the play with Gary.'

821
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:32,130
Luke looked at Fraser.

822
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,040
Fraser looked at Luke.

823
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,309
'Okay,' said Fraser.

824
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,680
'Here he comes now,' said Tom.

825
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,970
The new group rehearsed very hard.

826
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:50,069
Gary really liked being a man made of clay
but he often forgot his words.

827
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:54,520
Three days before the competition, Gary forgot
his words again.

828
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,270
'I'm hopeless, aren't I?' said Gary to Tom.

829
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,010
'No, you're not,' said Tom.

830
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,030
'You've worked very hard.

831
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,849
I'm really happy you're in our play, Gary.

832
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:08,780
We couldn't do it without you.'

833
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,920
The day before the competition, the boys went
to the school hall.

834
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,850
All the groups had to rehearse their plays
in front of the teachers and the principal.

835
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,790
Tom and his group were third.

836
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,930
The first group did some pages from Macbeth.

837
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:31,069
'It's good that we're not doing a play by
Shakespeare,' said Fraser quietly.

838
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:33,740
The second group did a funny play.

839
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,400
'Oh, that was very good,' said Luke.

840
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,230
'Maybe they'll win.'

841
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,720
Then Tom's group went on stage.

842
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,180
Fire Light went well.

843
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,900
At the end, Fraser came on stage.

844
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,099
He was tap dancing and carrying a stick.

845
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,260
The stick was on fire.

846
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,180
He danced over to Tom and Gary.

847
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,400
They held a big golden bowl.

848
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,270
Fraser put the stick into the golden bowl.

849
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,820
Then the bowl was full of fire.

850
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:11,270
'I, Prometheus, give you fire!' said Fraser.

851
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,540
'Stop!'

852
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,140
Mr Barton called out.

853
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,099
'Stop the play!'

854
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:17,500
Fraser stopped dancing.

855
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,760
'What's wrong, sir?' asked Tom.

856
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,730
'Put that fire out now!' said Mr Barton.

857
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,160
Tom and Gary put out the fire.

858
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,109
'You cannot have fire on stage,' said Mr Barton.

859
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:36,760
'But we must have fire for our play, sir!'
said Tom.

860
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,559
'It's all about fire.'

861
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,340
'Not in this hall.

862
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,520
Get off the stage now,' said Mr Barton.

863
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,390
'Next group, please.'

864
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,240
What could they do?

865
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,900
Was this the end of their play?

866
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,770
'I have an idea,' said Tom to the group.

867
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,420
He went over to Mr Barton.

868
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,500
They had a long talk.

869
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,569
Luke, Fraser and Gary stood and watched them.

870
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:07,170
Then Tom came back to the group.

871
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,489
'It's okay.

872
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:12,089
The show must go on!

873
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:14,950
And it will.

874
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,359
Listen...'

875
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:18,810
It was the night of the competition.

876
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,079
Heath Mason was in the hall.

877
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,720
A lot of boys and their families were there.

878
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,370
Anton was there with his mother and father.

879
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,470
It was a big night.

880
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,150
There were ten plays.

881
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,420
Tom's group was the last group of the night.

882
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,920
The other groups did their plays.

883
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,520
Some of the plays were very good.

884
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,690
Then it was time for Tom's group.

885
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,740
Tom went up on stage.

886
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,790
He spoke to the people in the hall.

887
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:54,990
'For the last play, please follow us outside
to the football field.'

888
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,740
There was a lot of noise.

889
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,990
Go outside?

890
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,110
Why?

891
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,809
People slowly went out of the hall and onto
the football field.

892
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:08,950
It was a very cold night but there were no
clouds.

893
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,830
The stars and the moon shone in the night
sky.

894
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:19,040
'Now, please stand in a big circle around
here,' said Tom.

895
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,630
He pointed to a large pile of sticks on the
ground.

896
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,140
The people all moved and stood in a circle
around the sticks.

897
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,809
Then Luke played his drums and the actors
walked into the circle.

898
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,820
On with the show!

899
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:41,119
At the end of the play, Fraser lit the golden
bowl of fire.

900
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,890
Then Gary and Tom carried the golden bowl
to the pile of sticks.

901
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:52,849
They put the golden bowl onto the pile, and
the fire from the bowl lit the sticks.

902
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:56,270
The fire danced high into the night sky.

903
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,700
Prometheus gave fire to men.

904
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,950
Nobody spoke.

905
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,670
Tom and his group stood quietly.

906
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,849
They took off their masks.

907
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:10,940
Then the crowd started cheering and clapping.

908
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,890
The boys smiled.

909
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,280
'They liked it,' said Fraser.

910
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,650
Heath Mason stepped close to the big fire
and held up his hands.

911
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,119
'Thank you to all the groups.

912
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,750
I really liked the plays tonight.

913
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,130
A lot of work has gone into all of them.

914
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,740
Now it's time to say who has won.

915
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:40,339
The prize for the best play goes to Fire Light!'

916
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:42,869
There was a lot of clapping and cheering.

917
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:46,020
Tom said to Anton, 'Come with us.

918
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,720
You made the masks and costumes.

919
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,460
You were one of the group.'

920
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,369
The five boys went and shook hands with Heath.

921
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:56,839
Heath held up his hands again.

922
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:06,170
'And the prize for the best actor goes to
Prometheus in Fire Light - Fraser McDonald.'

923
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,310
Fraser looked at Tom.

924
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,880
'Thanks, Tom,' he said quietly.

925
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,329
Then Fraser walked over to Heath and shook
hands with him again.

926
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:20,320
'You are a very good actor, Fraser,' said
Heath.

927
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,559
'You'll play my little brother very well.'

928
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,910
Heath looked around the circle of people and
said, 'One more thing.

929
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:35,550
I want to ask the boy who wrote Fire Light
to meet the writers of Here and Now.

930
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:39,070
We need good new writers for television.'

931
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:44,270
A short time later, the group stood by the
fire.

932
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,140
A lot of people had left.

933
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,750
It was late.

934
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,060
'Wow!

935
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,030
That was the best fun!' said Luke.

936
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:55,170
'Thanks to Tom,' said Fraser.

937
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,930
'You wrote the best play!'

938
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,220
Tom smiled and smiled.

939
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,119
He said to Gary, 'You weren't hopeless!'

940
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,119
Gary laughed.

941
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,400
'No, I wasn't.

942
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,940
I love being an actor.'

943
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,750
Heath Mason walked over to them.

944
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,280
'I love being an actor too!'

945
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
he said.

946
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,849
'I remember doing plays here at school, but
we never did a play out here.

947
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:24,060
That was a very good idea.

948
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,530
I have to go now, but I'll see you all in
November.

949
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:33,819
Fraser and Tom, the people from Here and Now
will speak to you two next week.'

950
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:36,680
'Thanks, Heath,' said Tom.

951
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,560
'Thanks for bringing plays back to our school.'

952
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,059
'Ha!

953
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:47,160
Just like Prometheus bringing fire to man!'
said Anton.

954
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,819
They all laughed.
