CHAPTER ONE
The Silver Swans

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,009
'I' don't think that I've ever been in love.'

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:16,900
She stopped for a minute and then she continued:
'How will I know?'

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,760
My name is Doctor Horatio Fundoby.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,930
But I am not the kind of doctor who sees sick
people.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,689
I am called a doctor because I have spent
many, many years studying.

7
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:39,990
I studied history, and I now have an important
job at the British Museum in London.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:47,670
Every Sunday afternoon I walk along a path
in Chelsea, on the bank of the River Thames.

9
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,190
A lot of painters live in Chelsea.

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,300
People often think that I am a painter.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,120
I look like one and I dress like one.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:06,550
I have a white beard, I carry a black wooden
stick, and I wear a large, old hat.

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:14,260
The hat is more than forty years old, and
I always wear it for my walks.

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,610
I enjoy my walks very much.

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,900
There is a lot to see and hear.

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,080
Boats pass on the river.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,600
Birds cry noisily above it.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,860
Along this bank of the river there are some
old houseboats.

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,140
People buy these houseboats because they like
living on the water.

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,610
They enjoy watching the passing boats and
listening to the sounds of a busy river.

21
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,310
They paint the boats in bright colours.

22
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:58,070
One Sunday afternoon I was standing by the
houseboats, looking across the river.

23
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:05,590
In the deepest water in the middle of the
Thames, I could see a beautiful, white sailing

24
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,280
ship.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,110
It was called the Poseidon.

26
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,780
The back of the ship was a little unusual.

27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,900
I knew that the owner of the ship was Lord
Struve.

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,560
He was a great scientist who studied ocean
life.

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:34,210
Near the Poseidon were a large ship from South
America and a dirty Spanish boat.

30
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,200
Then I noticed one of the houseboats near
the bank.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,710
It was called the Nerine and it was very colourful.

32
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:51,090
The boat was grey, but parts of it were painted
in bright colours.

33
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:58,550
The door was blue and the large wooden cover
in the floor of the front deck was bright

34
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,550
red.

35
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,810
There were some steps going from the boat
to the bank of the river.

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,240
These were painted blue, like the door.

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,230
I saw a young girl trying to push back the
cover.

38
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:22,280
She wanted to get out, and she was halfway
out of the hole, but she had a problem.

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,200
She saw me.

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:33,620
She didn't shout at me but her mouth formed
the words: 'I can't open it!'

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,510
I hurried towards the Nerine.

42
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,720
It was sitting on the bottom of the river
and I had to walk down the blue wooden steps,

43
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,780
over the water of the Thames.

44
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,180
I went carefully along the deck of the boat
until I reached the girl.

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:01,250
'The new red paint has dried and I can't open
the cover,' she said.

46
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,760
'Wait a minute,' I said.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
I used my stick to open it.

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,959
A few minutes later the girl climbed out on
to the deck.

49
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
She was about twenty years old.

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,570
She was wearing old, blue, paint-covered trousers
and a grey shirt.

51
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,120
I thought that she looked quite beautiful.

52
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,790
She looked at me with big, green eyes.

53
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,360
They were the loveliest part of her face.

54
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,630
'Thank you,' she said.

55
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,091
'That's all right,' I replied.

56
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,820
'I was glad to help.'

57
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,760
'You're a dear man,' she said.

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,840
'Do you know who you're like?

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,620
You're like one of those...

60
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,120
older men who work in museums.

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,130
Oh, I'm sorry!

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,130
That wasn't very polite.'

63
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,919
She smiled gently.

64
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,010
'But I am an old man,' I said.

65
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,710
'Please don't worry.

66
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,220
In fact I do work at the British Museum.

67
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,150
I'm Doctor Horatio Fundoby.'

68
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,570
'Oh!'

69
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,570
she said.

70
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,520
'The British Museum!'

71
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,450
She was silent for a second, and then she
asked, 'Would you like to see my octopus?'

72
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,510
'Yes, I would,' I said, smiling.

73
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:42,020
She took me down through the blue door into
a green room.

74
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,020
I could see a small bed, bookshelves and paintings.

75
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,860
Then I noticed two glass cases: one large
and one small.

76
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,980
In the small case were two fish and in the
large one was the octopus.

77
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,930
'Isn't it beautiful?'

78
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,300
she said.

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,630
'Sometimes I sit and look at it for hours.'

80
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,590
'Does it have a name?'

81
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,040
I asked.

82
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,820
'Oh, I just call it Octopus,' she replied.

83
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,250
'And you?

84
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,540
What's your name?'

85
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,030
I asked.

86
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,250
After a minute she said, 'My name's Thetis.'

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,310
'Ah,' I said.

88
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,440
'That's the name of one of the water people
in the Greek stories of long ago.

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,889
Thetis was the daughter of Nereus and Doris.

90
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,270
They lived at the bottom of the sea.'

91
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,860
She pulled her ear, thoughtfully.

92
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,070
'My real name's Alice,' she said.

93
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:06,300
'I call myself Thetis because I'd like to
live at the bottom of the ocean.'

94
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,620
When she said this, I could understand the
reason for her green room.

95
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,400
It was quite dark in the room.

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,690
The only lights were the ones that lit the
glass cases.

97
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:26,290
The paintings on the wall were in blues and
greens and showed fish and other underwater

98
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,290
animals.

99
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,770
I was sure that she was the painter.

100
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:40,020
She was almost a water-child herself, with
her small nose, large eyes and pretty, short,

101
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,290
brown hair.

102
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,389
'Would you like me to sing for you?'

103
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:46,480
she asked.

104
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,070
'Oh, please do,' I replied.

105
00:07:51,070 --> 00:08:05,740
'My song's called "The Silver Swans",' she
said.

106
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,970
How shall I know my true love?

107
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,729
When will my true heart speak to me?

108
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:18,230
Oh, when the silver swans come sailing,

109
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,750
Then I will know my true love.

110
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,830
Then I will be with my true love,

111
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:33,010
For ever with my true love.

112
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,300
It was a beautiful song.

113
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,649
But I felt that there was a sadness behind
the words.

114
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,639
The words were wise and understanding.

115
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,199
But I knew that the young girl in front of
me was never in love.

116
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,050
'That was lovely,' I said.

117
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,499
Thetis opened her eyes.

118
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:02,160
'Thank you,' she said.

119
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,970
'Who wrote it?'

120
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,850
I asked.

121
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,980
'I did,' she said.

122
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,209
'It's mine.'

123
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,879
'Do you often write songs?'

124
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,929
I asked, surprised.

125
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:22,459
'Only when they come into my head,' she replied.

126
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,820
Suddenly she moved towards me.

127
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,860
'How will I know my true love?'

128
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,569
she asked, seriously.

129
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,750
'How will I know when I'm really in love?'

130
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,040
'How old are you, Thetis?'

131
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
I asked.

132
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,499
'I'm twenty-one,' she answered.

133
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,790
'Have you been in love?'

134
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,589
I said.

135
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,130
'No,' she replied.

136
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,910
'I don't think that I've ever been in love.'

137
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,129
She stopped for a minute and then she continued:
'How will I know?

138
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:04,730
Who will tell me when I am?

139
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,089
You're so old and wise.

140
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,369
Can't you help me?'

141
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,389
She looked pale and unhappy.

142
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:19,459
I thought carefully before I answered her
questions.

143
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:27,119
At last I replied, 'When he's ill and ugly
and you can still love him.

144
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,199
Then you can be sure.'

145
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:37,920
'When he is ill and ugly...' she said to herself,
quietly.

146
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
She sat there thinking.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,850
Then suddenly she remembered that I was there.

148
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,630
'Oh, I'm sorry, I'm being rude,' she said.

149
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,869
'Would you like some tea, Doctor Fundoby?'

150
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:54,689
'I'd love some.

151
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:58,439
Thank you,' I replied.

152
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,820
She disappeared for two or three minutes.

153
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,639
I looked round the room again.

154
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,089
At last she returned, carrying the tea things.

155
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,769
She poured out the tea.

156
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:19,139
As she lifted her cup to her mouth, she said
again, 'When he is ill and ugly.

157
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,230
Oh, thank you, Doctor Fundoby!'

158
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,709
She smiled at me.

159
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,429
We talked for about half an hour.

160
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,959
She told me about her mother and father.

161
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,619
They also lived in London.

162
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:38,509
But she wanted to live alone on this houseboat.

163
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,589
She loved it because it was on the water.

164
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,760
She had an evening job.

165
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,670
But she did not tell me what it was.

166
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,439
Suddenly I began to feel quite ill.

167
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,390
I wasn't sure why.

168
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,700
But before I could decide, Thetis asked, 'Would
you like to go out on deck?'

169
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,820
There was not much room at the back of the
boat, but it was enough for the two of us.

170
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,779
Then I saw with surprise that there was water
all-round the boat now.

171
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,259
Four dirty white swans went past us.

172
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:24,989
Their feathers were dirty with oil from the
river, and their eyes looked very unfriendly.

173
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:28,269
Thetis looked at them.

174
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:34,309
I said, smiling, 'Perhaps they're the silver
swans in your song.

175
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,860
Perhaps you're going to meet your true love.'

176
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,249
She only said, 'These swans are a dirty grey
silver.'

177
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,110
Then a small wooden boat came up to us.

178
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:54,889
There was a tall, strong man in the boat - he
looked about thirty-five years old.

179
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:01,179
He was wearing a blue sailing shirt and dark
blue trousers.

180
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:08,239
He had black hair, a beard, and bright, blue
eyes.

181
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:14,910
'Hello!' he shouted, and his white teeth shone
against his dark beard.

182
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,799
'Have you some cotton to mend my trousers?

183
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,829
I caught them on a piece of wood.'

184
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:27,629
'Yes, of course,' Thetis called back.

185
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:33,730
'If you climb up here, I'll mend them for
you.'

186
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,670
The sailor laughed.

187
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,199
'I'll do it.

188
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,769
I can't tell you where they're caught!' he
said.

189
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,499
'Oh, I understand!'

190
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:49,239
Thetis said, smiling.

191
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,540
Then she went to find the cotton.

192
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,730
When she returned, she put it carefully in
a piece of cloth.

193
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,220
Then she threw the cloth into the boat.

194
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,519
The sailor caught it.

195
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,540
'Clever child,' he said.

196
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,230
'Thanks very much.

197
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,779
I'll be quick.'

198
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:18,019
He moved the boat away and then tied it up
next to another boat.

199
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,410
We watched as he mended his trousers with
his back towards us.

200
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,910
While we stood there, a large boat went past.

201
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,739
The Nerine started to go up and down in the
water.

202
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,920
I suddenly felt very sick.

203
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,829
Thetis saw my face.

204
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:41,910
'Oh, you poor man!'

205
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,980
she cried.

206
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,759
'I forget that moving boats sometimes make
people ill.

207
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,420
Come with me - I've got a bottle of medicine.

208
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,420
It will soon make you better.'

209
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,059
She helped me down into the green room, and
sat me in a chair.

210
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,370
I was feeling very ill now.

211
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,470
She went to a small cupboard and got a small
brown bottle from it.

212
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,249
She poured something from it into a spoon,
and gave it to me.

213
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:21,839
'They discovered this medicine during the
Second World War,' she said.

214
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:29,160
'Some of the sailors suffered badly in storms
or when the sea was rough.

215
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,360
You'll feel fine in a few minutes.

216
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,949
Just sit there quietly.'

217
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:39,160
She went out on deck.

218
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,540
I heard her shout to the man in the boat:
'Hello again!

219
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,260
What's your name?'

220
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,549
'Hadley.

221
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,949
Richard Hadley,' he called back.

222
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:54,709
'What's yours?'

223
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:00,419
'I've heard that name before,' I thought.

224
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,449
'But I can't remember where.'

225
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,779
'Thetis,' she replied.

226
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:16,670
There was silence for a minute, then he said,
'Oh, that's the name of the daughter of Nereus

227
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,959
and Doris in the old Greek stories.

228
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,730
They lived at the bottom of the sea.'

229
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,499
He was silent again.

230
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:32,319
Then I heard him call: 'Where's your father?'

231
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:35,189
'He isn't my father,' Thetis said.

232
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:39,529
'He's an old man who's visiting me.

233
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,109
He's feeling sick so I've given him some medicine.'

234
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:51,009
I heard the laugh in the sailor's voice as
he shouted, 'What!

235
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,470
Sick!

236
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,709
On that old houseboat?

237
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,160
It's like dry land on there.'

238
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,980
Another boat passed and the Nerine suddenly
moved up and down again.

239
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,060
But the medicine was beginning to work.

240
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:16,230
'It isn't an old boat,' Thetis said, seriously.

241
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,330
'It's my home.

242
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,270
And it does move up and down a lot sometimes.

243
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,550
You need a strong stomach.'

244
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:30,410
'Oh yes, I'm sure that you do,' he said.

245
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,040
But I knew from his voice that he didn't really
believe her.

246
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,870
'Really, it's true,' she continued.

247
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,560
'Perhaps even you'll get sick, one day.'

248
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,640
The sailor laughed loudly.

249
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,570
'Who, me?

250
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,510
Listen, child.

251
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:01,860
I've sailed every ocean and sea in the world,
and in all sorts of weather - and I haven't

252
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,640
been sick yet.'

253
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,950
I heard Thetis say, 'There's always a first
time.

254
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,370
Would you like to try?'

255
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:18,580
'Tell me when it gets really rough,' he said.

256
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,360
I heard his boat touch against the Nerine,
as he continued, 'You're not as young as I

257
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,170
thought.

258
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,170
I'm sorry that I called you a child.

259
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,820
Perhaps I'll try your boat sometime.

260
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,270
Well, thanks again for the cotton.'

261
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,130
At last I began to feel better.

262
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,780
When I went up on deck, Thetis was looking
out across the river.

263
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,620
She was watching the sailor as he went out
towards the lovely, white ship.

264
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,070
'Oh,' she said.

265
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,010
'You're better.'

266
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,920
'Yes,' I said.

267
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,830
'Good,' she said.

268
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,970
'That medicine always works.'

269
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,780
Then she added, 'He said some very unkind
things, didn't he?'

270
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,390
I started to say, 'He...'

271
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,900
'But wasn't he beautiful?'

272
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
she continued, dreamily.

273
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:29,520
CHAPTER TWO
The 

274
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,700
Silver Swans
'He's very ill, isn't he, Doctor Fundoby?

275
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,400
And I love him even more then when he's well.'

276
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,040
I did not see my friend for some weeks.

277
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:54,580
Then, on a rainy Sunday, as I walked past
the houseboats, somebody called my name.

278
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,890
'Doctor Fundoby!

279
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,190
Doctor Fundoby!'

280
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,120
I turned round.

281
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,730
Thetis was running up the steps from the Nerine.

282
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,550
She ran to me and said, 'Doctor Fundoby!

283
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,090
What shall I do?

284
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,220
My octopus has eaten one of his arms.'

285
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,520
I replied, 'They often do that when people
keep them.

286
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,350
Even when they feed them very well.'

287
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,530
'Oh,' she said.

288
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,900
'Thanks for telling me that.

289
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,720
I feel much better now.'

290
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,990
She turned and went back to her boat.

291
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:43,690
As she reached the deck, I called out to her,
'Did your sailor ever come back?'

292
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,940
'Yes,' she answered, and disappeared into
the boat.

293
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,620
A few days later a friend asked me to go and
see a play with him.

294
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:02,130
It was called The Unwanted, and it was at
Wyndham's Theatre in London.

295
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:09,220
'There's a young woman in it - Alice Adams,'
my friend said.

296
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,570
'She's very good, they say.

297
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,080
One day she'll be a great actress.'

298
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,000
When the play started, I couldn't believe
my eyes.

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,430
The young actress was Thetis!

300
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,790
I remembered, then, that her real name was
Alice.

301
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,940
So this was her evening job!

302
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,980
It was a sad play.

303
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,110
Thetis played a young girl who falls in love
with an older man.

304
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,160
In the end he leaves her and she kills herself.

305
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,280
Thetis played the part with deep feeling and
understanding.

306
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,310
It seemed to me almost that she was the poor
girl.

307
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,880
I cried for her at the end of the play.

308
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,539
The next Sunday I visited her on her boat.

309
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,610
There was now another glass case in her room.

310
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,620
There were two large fish in it.

311
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,460
She was sitting in front of the case, watching
them.

312
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,490
She got up to get the brown bottle.

313
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:29,290
The boat was not moving much, but she gave
me some of the medicine and I drank it.

314
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,240
'My dear,' I said.

315
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,160
'Why didn't you tell me who you were?

316
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,910
I was at Wyndham's last week.'

317
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,920
'I did tell you,' she said.

318
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,270
'This is the person that I am here.

319
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,200
This is the person that I really want to be.'

320
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,070
'You played the part very well,' I said.

321
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,250
'I cried at the end.

322
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:05,120
How can you put so much feeling into the part
night after night?

323
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,610
How can you show all that pain and unhappiness
if you have never been in love?'

324
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:18,790
She thought for a minute, then replied, 'That's
the other side of me.

325
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,090
I just do it.'

326
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,280
She saw me looking at the glass case.

327
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,510
'He gave them to me,' she said.

328
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,140
'The sailor?'

329
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,780
I said.

330
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,440
'Yes,' she said.

331
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,000
'Where did he get them?'

332
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
I asked.

333
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,280
'From the bottom of the river,' she answered.

334
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,740
'Did he?

335
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,970
How?'

336
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,860
I asked.

337
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,500
'He went down and looked for them,' she replied.

338
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,210
'Now I remember who Richard Hadley is!'

339
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,680
I thought to myself.

340
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,930
'Does she know?

341
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,980
And will her heart break, like the heart of
the girl in the play?'

342
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,270
'Is he in love with you?'

343
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,630
I asked.

344
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:16,780
'He laughs at me and says unkind things,'
she said.

345
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,630
'Does that mean that he's in love?'

346
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,530
'And you?'

347
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,430
I asked.

348
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,550
'Are you in love with him?'

349
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,690
'I don't know,' she cried.

350
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,690
'I don't know!

351
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,720
I don't know!

352
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Oh, Doctor Fundoby,

353
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,660
I hate being young!'

354
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,410
She put her head on my shoulder and started
to cry.

355
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,980
I tried to find the words to make her better.

356
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:51,550
The next Sunday I went for my usual walk.

357
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,460
It was very windy and the river was rough.

358
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,640
When I saw the Nerine, she was moving from
side to side.

359
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,200
Thinking of Thetis, I hurried towards the
boat.

360
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,290
Her room was small and the glass cases were
not safe in bad weather.

361
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:17,930
I noticed that the blue door was open, so
I quickly went down the steps.

362
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:25,210
When I reached the last step, I heard a deep
cry from Thetis's room.

363
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,320
I was afraid for her, and I hurried in.

364
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,850
Richard Hadley was lying on the bed.

365
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,650
He was very sick.

366
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,620
Thetis was sitting on the side of the bed,
holding his head in one of her arms.

367
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,020
His skin was a grey colour and his face was
pale.

368
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,620
At first I thought that he was dying.

369
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,080
Then the boat moved suddenly.

370
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,350
I understood then why he was like this.

371
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,790
'Thetis!'

372
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,910
I cried.

373
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,850
'The medicine!

374
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,850
Quickly!

375
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,720
Where is it?'

376
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
'Oh-h-h!'

377
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,570
cried the unhappy man.

378
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,360
'Go away, both of you, and leave me to die
alone!'

379
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,210
'I love him!'

380
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:23,230
Thetis said, happily holding his poor head
in her arms.

381
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,120
'Oh, now I know that I love him.

382
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,690
He's very ill, isn't he, Doctor Fundoby?

383
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,210
And I love him even more than when he's well.'

384
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,520
I went to the cupboard where Thetis kept the
brown bottle of medicine.

385
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,390
It was locked.

386
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,930
I looked at Thetis.

387
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,500
She looked sad.

388
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,270
'He refuses to say that he'll marry me,' she
said.

389
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:59,460
Then she added, looking down at him: 'I don't
mind being a poor sailor's wife.

390
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,060
When you sail away, I'll come with you.

391
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,940
We can sail round the world together.'

392
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,640
I almost laughed at her words.

393
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,300
Thetis had no idea about a sailor's life.

394
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,950
And she had no idea who Richard Hadley was.

395
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:24,990
The unhappy, weak man cried out: 'All right,
all right, I'll marry you!

396
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,610
I'll do anything, if you'll just go away.

397
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,170
Please leave me to die.'

398
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:38,360
I was beginning to feel very ill myself, so
I cried, 'Thetis!

399
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,300
You cold-hearted girl!

400
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,180
Give me the key now.

401
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,900
How can you leave him to suffer?

402
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,970
How can you do this to the man that you love?'

403
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,990
She untied a piece of blue cloth from around
her neck.

404
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,180
The key was on it.

405
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,370
She looked at the floor as she gave it to
me.

406
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,710
I knew that she was sorry now.

407
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:10,490
As I opened the cupboard, I heard her say,
quietly, 'He's sailed on every ocean and sea

408
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,980
in all sorts of weather.'

409
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:22,990
I took some of the medicine, then I gave some
to the great ocean scientist - Richard Hadley,

410
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,710
Lord Struve.

411
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,120
Thetis looked at me.

412
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,500
'Will you come to our wedding, Doctor Fundoby?'

413
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,180
she asked.

414
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,430
I was still feeling sick, and I was not happy
with her.

415
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:45,640
So I replied, 'If he marries you after this
suffering, he's crazy.'

416
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,070
Lord Struve probably suddenly felt better,
because he sat up.

417
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,470
He said, 'I'm glad that you said that, Doctor
Fundoby.

418
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,170
Promises don't mean anything when they are
made in ill-health.'

419
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:07,890
'But you wanted to come on to the Nerine in
this weather,' she said, sadly.

420
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,300
The colour was returning to his face.

421
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,400
I came for a good reason.

422
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,830
I love you, and I wanted to tell you that,'
he said.

423
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,050
'So why didn't you tell me?'

424
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,309
Thetis asked, simply.

425
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,330
For a minute he did not know what to say.

426
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,770
Then he said, suddenly, 'Because I felt ill.

427
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,029
Now listen, Thetis.

428
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:42,830
If you're going to marry me, you must know
two things.

429
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,559
You must know who I am.

430
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,210
You must know what I do.'

431
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,910
'They don't matter,' Thetis replied.

432
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,760
'I love you.'

433
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,670
I was feeling better, so I said, 'And your
acting?'

434
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,559
Lord Struve looked at me in surprise.

435
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,870
'Whose acting?' he asked.

436
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,980
'This is Alice Adams,' I cried.

437
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:17,470
'She's been in the play The Unwanted at Wyndham's
for the last two years.'

438
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,390
He looked at her.

439
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,309
'This child?' he said.

440
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:27,760
'She is a child, isn't she?'

441
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,910
Thetis moved her head in a silent yes.'

442
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:40,330
But I said: 'She's England's best young actress
and she's twenty-one.'

443
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,760
He stood up.

444
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,670
'Yes!' he cried.

445
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,700
'I remember reading something a long time
ago.

446
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,200
I've just come back from the Galapagos,' he
continued.

447
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,490
'I haven't heard anything about England for
nearly two years.'

448
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,620
Thetis jumped up and ran to him.

449
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,930
'Oh, please take me there!'

450
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,080
she said, in an excited voice.

451
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,260
'All my life I've wanted to go to the Galapagos.

452
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,810
Can sailors take their wives with them when
they go?'

453
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,970
Lord Struve cried, 'I'm not a sailor, Thetis!

454
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,030
I'm a-' He stopped.

455
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:30,830
He found it difficult to say: 'I'm a lord.'

456
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,320
He started again.

457
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,420
'I'm a kind of ocean scientist.

458
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,300
I do a lot of my work under water.

459
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,770
But your acting-'

460
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:47,490
Before he could finish, Thetis said: 'It doesn't
matter.

461
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,620
I never wanted to be an actress.

462
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,980
I only do it for the money.

463
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,270
I can buy octopuses, and live on the Nerine.

464
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,790
Do you know what a good octopus costs?'

465
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,740
Lord Struve held both her arms.

466
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,710
'Thetis, can you be serious for a minute?

467
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,520
Do you really mean that you'll give all that
away for me?'

468
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,130
'Of course,' she replied.

469
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:23,020
'More than anything in the world, I would
like to walk with you on the bottom of the

470
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,320
ocean near the Galapagos, because...'

471
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,670
She stopped for a minute, thinking.

472
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,679
'Because I'm sure that I love you.

473
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,320
Doctor Fundoby showed me that.'

474
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,059
For another minute Lord Struve held her two
arms, while he looked up with a very happy

475
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,270
look on his face.

476
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,490
He seemed unable to believe what he was hearing.

477
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,910
And so the song of 'The Silver Swans' came
true.

478
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:04,370
Thetis, the water-child, married her lord
of the sea - Richard Hadley.

479
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:12,670
I still walk along by the River Thames, but
I don't enjoy the walk as much as before.

480
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:19,920
Lord Struve, his wife and her octopus have
gone away to a beautiful island in the Pacific

481
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,320
Ocean.

482
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,840
There they work together with the wonderful
undersea plants and animals around them.

483
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,080
A family have bought the Nerine and they have
painted her a dark brown colour.

484
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,890
They have changed the name to the Nelson,
after one of the greatest British sailors

485
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,970
- Sir Horatio Nelson.

486
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:52,610
I pass her every Sunday and a washing line
goes from the back of the boat to the front.

487
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,710
It is filled with washing - the clothes of
small children.

488
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,920
And I think, as I go past, 'Do they have strong
stomachs like Thetis?

489
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,859
Or did she give them the name of that wonderful
medicine in the brown bottle?'

490
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:10,389
- THE END -
