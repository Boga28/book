CHAPTER ONE
The big caves

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:18,570
My name is Taras.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,130
I am old...

4
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,699
3,000 years old.

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,930
I sit here, under the Palace of Knossos.

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,890
My sister, Aketa, sits next to me.

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,270
She, too, is old. 3,000 years.

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,700
1
We do not eat, we do not drink, and our eyes

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,540
never close.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,160
Are we dead, or alive?

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,940
It is not important.

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,321
We sit, and we wait.

13
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,750
And we watch.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,070
For 3,000 years.

15
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,180
We are the Watchers.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,009
The god is here, too.

17
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:15,630
The god Poseidon, god of the sea, stands here
in this hall.

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,770
We watch his statue.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,390
It is gold, all gold.

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,189
He stands here, five meters tall.

21
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:26,530
His arms are gold, his hair is gold, his face
is gold.

22
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:35,390
And his gold eyes shine in this dark hall.

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,789
We are his Watchers.

24
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,700
Jim and Stella, his sister, are on holiday
in Greece.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,360
They are staying at a hotel in Iraklion, on
Crete.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,959
They are talking to their friend, Nikos.

27
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,179
Nikos is a Cretan and lives near the Palace
of Knossos.

28
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,560
'What are we going to do tomorrow?

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
Can we go to Knossos?'

30
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,399
'Yes.

31
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,399
Why not?

32
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,110
It's a very famous place.

33
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,950
And very, very old.

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,450
About 3,000 or 4,000 years old.'

35
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,440
'Yes, I'd like to...'

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
'Stella!

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Look at this.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,920
If's about Knossos.

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
It's very interesting.'

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
CRETE NEWS

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
10 August

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,580
Caves Under Knossos Iraklion, Crete

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,170
UNDER the famous Palace of Knossos there are
many caves.

44
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,370
Some of these caves are very big, and some
are many, many meters under the ground.

45
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,350
What is in these caves?

46
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,970
Nobody knows The caves are very dangerous.

47
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,100
Next week Yannis Papadakis is going to...

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,180
'We're going to find these caves, Stella!

49
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,650
Are you coming with us, Nikos?'

50
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,680
'But Jim...'

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,390
'Yes, yes, I'm coming with you.

52
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,980
You can stay with me at my mother's house
near Knossos.'

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
'Good.

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,820
We're going to need a lot of things.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Lights.

56
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,210
And food and water.

57
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,560
And we need...'

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
'Yes, but it's OK.

59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,740
I can get everything.

60
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,830
'Jim, the caves are dangerous.'

61
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,410
'Yes, but Nikos knows a lot about caves.'

62
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,430
'Yes, I do.

63
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,450
And I know the Palace of Knossos very well.

64
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,450
Don't forget...

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,450
I work there!'

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,880
'But do you know these caves under Knossos?'

67
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,930
'No, I don't.

68
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,070
But we're going to be careful.'

69
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,790
'Oh, all right.

70
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,240
When are we going?'

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
'Tomorrow!'

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,970
Sometimes there are lights in these halls.

73
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,760
And music.

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,690
The people from the Palace come down here.

75
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,840
They are small, quick people, with dark eyes
and dark hair.

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,543
They bring lights, and food, and water...

77
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:55,680
and they dance the dance of the god.

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,000
They are the god's people.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,050
No, no, I forget...

80
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,210
They do not come now.

81
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,100
These halls are quiet... dark and quiet.

82
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,780
It is always night now.

83
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,340
There is no music, no dancing.

84
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,310
There are no people in the Palace now... not
after the fire and the water from the sea.

85
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,980
They are dead... all dead.

86
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,060
And we, Aketa and I, sit in the hall of the
god.

87
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,240
We wait and we watch.

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,380
We are the god's Watchers.

89
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:47,880
CHAPTER TWO
The first day

90
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,460
At the palace of Knossos.

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,540
It is seven o'clock in the morning.

92
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,780
Nikos is looking for the door to the caves.

93
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,920
Jim and Stella are waiting for him.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,020
The sun is hot.

95
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,570
'I'm thirsty.

96
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,300
I'm going to drink some water.'

97
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,720
'Don't drink a lot.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,980
We need it in the caves.'

99
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,090
'Have we got everything?'

100
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,090
'I think so.

101
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,080
The bags are very heavy.'

102
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
'Jim!

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Stella!

104
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,200
The door's here!

105
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,070
Come on, we can go down now.'

106
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,980
'Be careful!'

107
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,750
'It's very dark.

108
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,120
I can't see anything.'

109
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
'Here, hold this light.

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,120
We need all the lights now.'

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,340
'Walk slowly.

112
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,660
And be very careful.'

113
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,590
'Yes, I know!'

114
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,330
'How many caves are there?

115
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,940
This is the tenth cave now.'

116
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,160
'I can see another one in front of us.

117
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,550
A long one.'

118
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,940
'I'm tired.

119
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,670
I don't want to look at any more caves today.'

120
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,170
'How about some food?

121
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm hungry.'

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,990
'Yes, let's eat something.

123
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,810
And we can stay here for the night.'

124
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,810
'Good!

125
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,400
Where's the bag?

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
The food is in there.'

127
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,010
'How old are these caves, Nikos?'

128
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,770
'I don't know.

129
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,470
3,000 years?

130
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,170
4,000 years?'

131
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,430
'Do many people come to these caves?'

132
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,960
'Not many people, no.

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,860
Only the old Greek gods.

134
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,010
The god Poseidon lives in caves, some people
say.'

135
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,080
'The god Poseidon!

136
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,460
There are no old gods in these caves.'

137
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,160
'How do you know, Jim?'

138
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,240
'The old Greek gods are only stories.

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,590
You read about them in books.

140
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,380
They're not important today.'

141
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,300
'Oh yes, they are.

142
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,220
Don't laugh at them.

143
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,449
And Poseidon is a dangerous god.

144
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,280
All the books say that.

145
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,210
He's the god of the sea, and the god of earthquakes,
too.

146
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,639
We have a lot of earthquakes in Greece.

147
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,639
Don't forget that.'

148
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,639
'Oh Nikos!

149
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,639
That's silly!

150
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
The god of earthquakes?

151
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,520
Everybody knows that earthquakes...'

152
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,520
'No, Jim.

153
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,020
Nikos is right.

154
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,770
We don't understand everything.

155
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:15,710
And don't laugh at Poseidon... not here in
these caves.'

156
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,290
The years come, and the years go.

157
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,580
3,000 years.

158
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,990
My sister Aketa and I sit... and wait.

159
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,460
It is dark and cold in the hall of the god.

160
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,750
The sun never shines here.

161
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,530
Sometimes people come to these halls.

162
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,860
They are not the god's people.

163
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,979
They look for gold, only gold.

164
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,820
And Poseidon is angry.

165
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,889
It is the gold of his people... and now it
is the god's gold, because his people are

166
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,120
dead.

167
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Nobody can take the god's gold, or look at
the gold face of the god... and live.

168
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,360
But there are no lights, no people now.

169
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,100
Only the god Poseidon stands here in this
dark hall - god of the blue sea, god of the

170
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,729
green sea, god of this dark hall.

171
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:26,820
We are his Watchers.

172
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:36,930
CHAPTER THREE
The second day

173
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:43,000
'Wake up, Stella.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,060
Good morning, Nikos!

175
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,089
'Morning?

176
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:53,710
It's always night in these caves!

177
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,710
What's the time?'

178
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,210
'Seven o'clock.

179
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,110
Are we going on... or back?'

180
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,370
'What do you think, Nikos?

181
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,370
'Mmm.

182
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,650
I don't know.

183
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,730
How many caves are there?

184
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,730
Fifteen?

185
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,730
Twenty?

186
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,730
I don't know.

187
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,760
But we can look at the next... or two.'

188
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
'Or three, or four, or five.

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
I know you, Jim.

190
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,890
You want to see everything.'

191
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,700
'This is the fourteenth cave.

192
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,630
And this cave is big, very big.'

193
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,630
'Look!

194
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,230
This is a road.

195
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,210
We're walking on a road!'

196
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,170
'Yes, you're right.

197
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,080
It's a very old road, too.

198
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,750
Look at these stones on the floor.

199
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,000
They're thousands of years old.'

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,520
'But whose road is it?

201
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,470
And where does it go to?'

202
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,190
'I don't know, but we can follow it.'

203
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,290
'But it's six o'clock now.

204
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,480
I think...'

205
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
'Listen!

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,350
I can hear water.

207
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,450
Can you hear it?

208
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,690
There's a river in front of us.'

209
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,600
'We can't get across a river!'

210
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,030
'Oh yes, we can!'

211
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,080
'I don't want to go across.

212
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,420
It's dangerous.'

213
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,440
'No, it isn't.

214
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,450
Come on, Stella!'

215
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,800
'Stella's right.

216
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,190
Rivers under the ground are dangerous, but...'

217
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,190
'Listen!

218
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,190
I can hear something...'

219
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,000
'It's only the river, Stella.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,459
It's all right.

221
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,850
We can go across the river, and then we can
stop and stay there for the night.'

222
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,850
'Yes.

223
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,860
We can make a fire, and have some food.'

224
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,820
Listen, sister.

225
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,760
Do you hear anything?

226
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,520
There are people at the river.

227
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,860
They are talking and laughing.

228
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,500
Listen, sister.

229
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,390
They are coming here... to the hall of the
god.

230
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,390
Why?

231
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,890
Who are they?

232
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,150
What do they want?

233
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,150
Gold...

234
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,790
They want gold.

235
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,790
All people want gold.

236
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,500
They cannot eat it, they cannot drink it.

237
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,290
But the love of gold is in all men... and
women, too.

238
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,490
But they cannot take the god's gold.

239
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,170
We are his Watchers.

240
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,550
We call the god, and we say his name.

241
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:24,399
Then the god wakes... and he speaks.

242
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:36,839
CHAPTER FOUR
The third day

243
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,890
'When are we going to go back?

244
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,950
This is the third day now.

245
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,720
I don't like these caves.'

246
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,820
'Why not, Stella?'

247
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,920
'I don't know.

248
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,820
I can hear something... or someone.

249
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,790
It's not the river.

250
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,940
I want to go back, Nikos.'

251
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
'Yes.

252
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,180
Sometimes I can hear something, too.

253
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,670
But there's nobody in these caves, Stella.

254
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,670
Only us.'

255
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,160
'Let's look at one more cave.

256
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,640
Then we can go back.

257
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
OK?'

258
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,399
'What's Jim doing?'

259
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,470
'I don't know.

260
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,450
He's looking at something.

261
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,900
Jim, what are you...?'

262
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
'Hey!

263
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Look at this!

264
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,880
It's a bowl... a gold bowl.'

265
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,940
'It's beautiful.

266
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,220
Can I hold it for a minute?

267
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,990
It's very heavy, too.

268
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,209
Look at all this gold!'

269
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,990
'Is it old, Nikos?'

270
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,410
'Yes, thousands of years old, I think.'

271
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,920
'We can sell it - we can get a lot of money
for this bowl.'

272
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,500
'We can't do that!

273
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
It's not ours.'

274
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,380
'Whose is it, then?'

275
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,800
'It's, well, it's...

276
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I don't know.

277
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,790
But it's not ours!'

278
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,870
'Don't take it, Jim.

279
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,130
Leave it here.'

280
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,860
'No, I'm going to take it.

281
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,210
It's ours now.'

282
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,470
'Can you hear them, sister?

283
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,660
They are near the hall now.

284
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Listen...

285
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,839
They are looking for gold... gold.

286
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,230
All people want gold.'

287
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,700
'Look at that next cave.

288
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Can you see it?

289
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
It's huge.'

290
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,019
'It's not a cave... it's a hall... a huge
hall.'

291
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,730
'Jim, Nikos, don't go in there!'

292
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,070
'Why not, Stella?'

293
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,740
'I think someone is watching us.

294
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,520
I don't like it.'

295
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,740
'Why don't we go back?

296
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Please!'

297
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,110
'Who is watching us?

298
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,940
We're the only people here.

299
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,140
Stella I don't know.

300
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,060
But someone, or something, is watching us.

301
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,430
And it doesn't like us.'

302
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,350
'Don't be silly, Stella.

303
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,240
Nothing is watching us.

304
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Come on.'

305
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,620
'I can see them now, sister.

306
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,430
Two men and a woman.

307
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,430
They are young.

308
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,600
Two of them have blue eyes...

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,990
They are not people from the Palace.'

310
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,690
'They are not the god's people.

311
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,870
And they cannot come in here.

312
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,950
They cannot take the god's gold.'

313
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,660
'They cannot look at the face of the god.'

314
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,000
'Look at those statues there.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,399
They're very, very old.

316
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,399
They're...'

317
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,610
'I don't like them.

318
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,950
Look at their eyes!

319
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,710
Come away, Stella.'

320
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,960
'I can see something at the end of the hall.'

321
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,100
'Look!

322
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
What is it?

323
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,960
It's tall... very tall.

324
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,440
It's a statue, a huge statue... and it's shining.

325
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,230
It's gold - all gold!'

326
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,590
'Don't look at it.

327
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,940
Don't go in there.

328
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,710
Please, Jim, please!

329
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,880
It's dangerous.

330
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,650
Stop him, Nikos.

331
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,830
Stop him.'

332
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,370
'They are looking into the hall now.

333
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,220
Call the god!'

334
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,530
'Now, sister, now!

335
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,200
Say the name of the god!

336
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,440
They cannot come in...

337
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,709
They cannot come in...'

338
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:15,649
'Shh, be quiet for a minute.

339
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,630
Wait, Jim.

340
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,630
Listen.'

341
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,630
'Why?

342
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,630
What's...'

343
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,630
'Shh!

344
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,630
I think Stella's right.

345
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,630
There's something...'

346
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,630
'Listen!

347
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,630
Nikos, what's that?

348
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,630
Can you hear it?'

349
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,630
'Oh no!

350
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,630
No!

351
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,630
The ground is moving...

352
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,630
It's an earthquake!

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,010
There's going to be an earthquake!

354
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,710
The stones are falling!

355
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,230
Run...

356
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,760
Run!

357
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,890
Back to the river...

358
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,890
Run!'

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,890
'Quick, Stella!

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,890
Run...

361
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,890
Run!'

362
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,890
'We can't!

Everything is falling!

Anna Stavros, mother of Nikos Stavros, says:
'Nikos and his two English friends, Jim and

372
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,730
Stella, are in the caves under the Palace
of Knossos.

373
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,250
But where is the door to the caves?

374
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,110
Nobody can find it now after the earthquake.

375
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,279
My son and his friends cannot get out.

376
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,110
They are dead.'

377
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,660
The god Poseidon, god of the sea, is angry.

378
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,800
He speaks, and the ground moves, and the stones
fall.

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,592
But the god can sleep again now, sister.

380
00:16:55,592 --> 00:17:00,000
The men and the woman are quiet.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,889
They cannot move.

382
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,070
They lie under the stones.

383
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:11,799
They hold the god's gold bowl in their hands,
but they cannot go back across the river.

384
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:28,970
And they cannot look at the face of the god.

385
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:41,760
The god's gold eyes shine in this dark hall.

386
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,950
We are his Watchers...

387
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,540
- THE END -
