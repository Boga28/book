CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,709 --> 00:00:03,709
Staff Plans

3
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:09,210
July 1956

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,400
It seems increasingly likely that I will undertake
the expedition that has been on my mind for

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,590
some days.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,489
It is an expedition which I will undertake
alone, in the comfort of Mr Farraday's Ford.

7
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,529
It will take me through much of the finest
countryside in England to the West Country,

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,680
and may keep me away from Darlington Hall
for five or six days.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,040
Mr Farraday himself suggested the idea to
me one afternoon almost a fortnight ago, when

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,539
I was dusting the paintings in the library.

11
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:48,839
I was, in fact, on the stepladder when my
employer entered the room.

12
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:54,359
He was carrying a few books which he presumably
wished to return to the shelves.

13
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,440
He took the opportunity to inform me that
he had arranged to return to the United States

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,550
for a period of five weeks between August
and September.

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,510
After making this announcement, he put his
books down on a table, sat down and stretched

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,330
his legs.

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,900
Then he said:

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,160
'Stevens, I don't expect you to be locked
up here in this house all the time while I'm

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,770
away.

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:26,530
Why don't you take the car and drive off somewhere
for a few days?'

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,430
This was so unexpected that, at first, I did
not quite know how to reply.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,810
I certainly thanked him for his consideration,
but I probably said nothing very definite,

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,610
for my employer went on:

24
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,740
'I'm serious, Stevens.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,290
I really think you should take a break.

26
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,290
I'll pay for the petrol.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,540
You fellows, you're always locked up in these
big houses.

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,830
How do you ever manage to see anything of
this beautiful country of yours?'

29
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,680
'It has been my privilege to see the best
of England over the years, sir, within these

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,580
walls,' I replied.

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,680
Mr Farraday did not seem to understand this
statement, for he continued:

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,140
'I mean it, Stevens.

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,660
It's wrong that a man can't explore his own
country.

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,960
Take my advice and get out of the house for
a few days.'

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,650
As you might expect, I did not accept Mr Farraday's
invitation immediately.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,140
I regarded it as just another example of an
American gentleman's unfamiliarity with English

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,060
custom.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,620
The change in my attitude to this same suggestion
over the following days is mainly due to - and

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,400
why should I hide it?

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,900
- the arrival of Miss Kenton's letter, her
first in almost seven years.

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,490
But let me make it immediately clear what
I mean by this.

42
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:04,190
Miss Kenton's letter gave me an idea concerning
professional matters here at Darlington Hall.

43
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,959
Over the past few months, I have been responsible
for a series of small errors in the performance

44
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:10,959
of my duties.

45
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,030
None of these errors has been at all serious.

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,350
Nevertheless, I am not accustomed to making
errors, and I have found this development

47
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,840
rather upsetting.

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,959
The arrival of Miss Kenton's letter, however,
opened my eyes to a simple truth: that these

49
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,230
small errors of recent months have been the
result of a faulty staff plan.

50
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,740
It is, of course, the responsibility of every
butler to take great care when creating a

51
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,599
staff plan.

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,820
I agree with the view that the ability to
organize staff duties is central to the skills

53
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,300
of a good butler.

54
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,320
If, therefore, the present staff plan is at
fault, I can only blame myself.

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:04,840
However, in my defence, I must say that my
task has been unusually difficult.

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,130
After purchasing Darlington Hall, Mr Farraday
had to remain in the United States for four

57
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,560
months.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,579
He was, however, keen to keep the staff that
had served Lord Darlington so well.

59
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,970
This 'staff' was, in fact, only a small team
of six people who continued to look after

60
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,189
the house for Lord Darlington's relatives
until it was sold.

61
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:33,469
I regret that, when the purchase was completed,
I could not prevent four of the five other

62
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:37,849
members of staff leaving for new employment.

63
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,349
Only Mrs Clements and I remained.

64
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:46,789
I informed my new employer of the situation,
and was told to employ more staff.

65
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:53,249
But, as you know, it is not easy to find satisfactory
staff nowadays.

66
00:04:53,249 --> 00:05:00,419
By the time Mr Farraday arrived at Darlington
Hall, I had only employed two new people.

67
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,750
When I told him of my difficulties, Mr Farraday
requested a staff plan which would allow the

68
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,550
present staff of four to run the house.

69
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,550
Parts of the house, he said, might have to
be shut down.

70
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,580
He was sure, though, that, with my skill and
experience, I could keep most of the rooms

71
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,330
in use.

72
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,300
There was a time when a staff of twenty-eight
had been employed here at Darlington Hall,

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,300
so I felt, at that moment, a little anxious.

74
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,939
Mr Farraday must have noticed the worried
look on my face, although I tried to hide

75
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,310
it from him, because he added:

76
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,330
'Of course, if it is necessary, you may hire
an additional member of staff.

77
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,789
But I would be most grateful if you could
try working with four.'

78
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,100
I spent many hours on the staff plan.

79
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,039
I wanted Mrs Clements to suffer as little
change to her routine as possible.

80
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,289
The two new young girls, Rosemary and Agnes,
were inexperienced, so I could not expect

81
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,430
them to do too much.

82
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,680
This meant, of course, that I undertook for
myself a number of duties which are not usually

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,189
part of a butler's life.

84
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,969
I think my staff plan was as good as possible
under the circumstances.

85
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:23,729
However, I now realize that I gave myself
too much to do.

86
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,960
You may be amazed that I failed to notice
such an obvious weakness in the staff plan.

87
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:37,259
But an accidental, external circumstance often
brings to one's attention a simple truth.

88
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,990
In this case, the circumstance was the arrival
of Miss Kenton's letter.

89
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,009
The letter, with its happy memories of Darlington
Hall, made me realize that I was making errors

90
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,330
because I was overworked.

91
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,349
And I was overworked because we were understaffed.

92
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:01,970
I recalled Miss Kenton's great affection for
this house, and her high professional standards.

93
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,719
She was, I knew, just the person I needed
to enable me to complete a fully satisfactory

94
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,360
staff plan for Darlington Hall.

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,749
As a result of this analysis of the situation,
I was soon reconsidering Mr Farraday's kind

96
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,659
suggestion.

97
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:25,629
If I took his advice and had a few days' break,
I would be able to drive to the West Country

98
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,719
and visit Miss Kenton.

99
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,770
I could then explore in more detail her wish
to return to employment here at Darlington

100
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,080
Hall.

101
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,569
I did not, however, discuss the matter with
Mr Farraday for several days.

102
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:46,229
I needed more time to consider the practicalities
of the expedition: the cost, the time, the

103
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:51,509
possibility that I might have misunderstood
the purpose of Miss Kenton's letter.

104
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,839
Mr Farraday himself might not have been serious
in his offer.

105
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,669
Eventually, I decided to speak to Mr Farraday
about this as I served afternoon tea in the

106
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,250
drawing room.

107
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,369
Mr Farraday has usually just returned from
a short walk in the grounds at this time,

108
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,179
and he is rarely busy.

109
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:17,249
In fact, when I bring him afternoon tea, he
often closes the book or journal that he is

110
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:21,369
reading, stands up and stretches his arms
in front of the windows.

111
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:25,360
He appears to expect conversation with me.

112
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,490
I had forgotten, however, that, in the afternoon,
Mr Farraday prefers humorous chat to serious

113
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,490
conversation.

114
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,719
He likes to banter.

115
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,620
I should not, therefore, have mentioned the
fact that a former housekeeper of Darlington

116
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,560
Hall was living in the area that I was planning
to visit.

117
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,930
It gave Mr Farraday the opportunity to banter.

118
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,810
He grinned at me and said:

119
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,000
'You surprise me, Stevens.

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,709
A lady-friend.

121
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,300
And at your age.'

122
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,710
Lord Darlington would never have placed an
employee in such an embarrassing situation.

123
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,660
But I do not mean to imply that Mr Farraday
is unkind.

124
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,950
He was, I am sure, simply enjoying the sort
of bantering which, in the United States,

125
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,730
may be a sign of a good, friendly understanding
between employer and employee.

126
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,081
Bantering has been a regular feature of our
relationship over the last few months, although

127
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:25,050
I am still rather unsure of how to respond.

128
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:31,029
When Mr Farraday first moved into Darlington
Hall, I was once or twice astonished by some

129
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,730
of the things he said to me.

130
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,050
For example, I once asked him if a certain
gentleman was likely to be accompanied by

131
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,680
his wife on his visit to the house.

132
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,470
'God help us if she does come,' Mr Farraday
replied.

133
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,829
'Maybe you could take her out, Stevens.

134
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,550
You could take her to one of those stables
around Mr Morgans farm.

135
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,509
She may be just your type.'

136
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:59,260
For a moment or two I had no idea what my
employer was saying.

137
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,660
Then I realized that he was making a joke
and I attempted to smile appropriately.

138
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,970
Over the following days I learnt not to be
shocked by my employer's joking remarks.

139
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,940
I smiled in the correct manner whenever I
noticed a bantering tone in his voice.

140
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,180
Nevertheless, I could never be sure what he
expected of me on these occasions.

141
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,769
Should I laugh, or should I respond with a
similar type of remark?

142
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,980
This last possibility has made me quite anxious.

143
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,740
It is possible that my employer considers
my inability to respond to his bantering as

144
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,560
a serious failure of mine.

145
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,829
I did once attempt to banter, but my employer
simply looked up at me and said:

146
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:49,740
'I beg your pardon, Stevens?'

147
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,279
This was so discouraging that, I must admit,
I have not made any more recent attempts.

148
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,660
But, at the same time, I cannot help feeling
that Mr Farraday is not satisfied with my

149
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,019
various responses to his banter.

150
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:10,459
You will understand, therefore, how uncomfortable
the situation was for me yesterday afternoon.

151
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:15,540
If I had replied to my employer's banter at
that moment, the situation would only have

152
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,089
become more embarrassing.

153
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:20,160
I therefore said nothing.

154
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,310
'I didn't think you were a lady's man, Stevens,'
Mr Farraday went on.

155
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,220
'Keeps the spirit young, I guess.

156
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,660
But then I really don't know if I should help
you with such improper activities.'

157
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,269
I smiled slightly, and continued to stand
there awkwardly, waiting for my employer to

158
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,310
give me permission to undertake the motoring
trip.

159
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,480
After a short delay, Mr Farraday kindly gave
his permission and remembered his generous

160
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,449
offer to pay for the petrol.

161
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:57,339
So now there seems little reason why I should
not undertake my motoring trip to the West

162
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:58,339
Country.

163
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:04,480
I would, of course, have to write to Miss
Kenton to tell her I might be in her area.

164
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,949
I would also need to consider the matter of
suitable clothes for the journey.

165
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:13,759
There would be other questions concerning
arrangements here in the house during my absence.

166
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:22,959
But, on the whole, I can see no real reason
why I should not go.

167
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,470
CHAPTER TWO

168
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,750
Unfamiliar Territory

169
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,519
September 1956

170
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,980
Tonight, I have taken a room at a guest house
in the city of Salisbury.

171
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,959
The first day of my trip is completed and
I feel quite satisfied with it.

172
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,709
It is hard to explain my feelings when I finally
left Darlington Hall this morning.

173
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,430
For the first twenty minutes of motoring,
I cannot say that I was filled with excitement

174
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,779
or anticipation.

175
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:02,290
As I motored in the sunshine, I continued
to be surprised by the familiarity of the

176
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,350
countryside around me.

177
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,509
But eventually the surroundings became unrecognizable
and I knew that I had gone beyond all previous

178
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:12,509
boundaries.

179
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:17,900
I confess, I experienced a mild sensation
of alarm.

180
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,010
This increased when I found myself on a road
curving around the edge of a hill.

181
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,480
I could sense the steep drop to my left, although
I could not see it through the trees and thick

182
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,870
bushes that lined the roadside.

183
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,689
I felt now that I had truly left Darlington
Hall behind, and I was suddenly afraid that

184
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,440
I was not on the correct road.

185
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,980
It was only the feeling of a moment, but it
caused me to slow down.

186
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,370
Even when I had assured myself that I was
on the right road, I felt I had to stop the

187
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,720
car for a moment to consider my situation.

188
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,310
I decided to get out and stretch my legs a
little.

189
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,540
When I had stepped out of the car, the feeling
of being halfway up a steep hill increased.

190
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:11,129
On one side of the road, the bushes and trees
rose steeply on the other, as I looked down

191
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:15,500
through the trees, I could see the distant
countryside.

192
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,810
I suddenly decided that I wanted a clearer
view, and I walked along the road until I

193
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,160
found a narrow footpath which led up the hill.

194
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,699
I hesitated for a moment, for the path looked
steep and rather rough.

195
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,660
Then I began to climb.

196
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,930
It was a long, hard walk, but it did not cause
me any great difficulty.

197
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:44,800
Finally, I came out of the trees and saw a
bench in the middle of a small, open area.

198
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,910
I walked to the bench and, turning round,
I was pleased to see that the climb had not

199
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,970
been a waste of time.

200
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,020
I had a most marvellous view of the surrounding
countryside.

201
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,470
There were hundreds of fields bordered by
hedges and trees, and the land rose and fell

202
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,589
gently towards the distant horizon.

203
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:12,269
As I listened to the sounds of summer and
felt the light wind on my face, my feelings

204
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:17,290
of alarm and anxiety about leaving my familiar
territory disappeared.

205
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,820
I told myself that it was foolish to worry
about meeting Miss Kenton again.

206
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:28,319
Indeed, as I looked at that wonderful view,
I even began to feel, for the first time,

207
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,680
a sense of excitement at the journey ahead.

208
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,079
Now, this evening, I find myself in this small
but comfortable guest house not far from the

209
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,449
centre of Salisbury.

210
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:48,259
The landlady, a woman of about forty, noticed
my car and my high-quality suit, and seems

211
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,579
to think that I am a rather grand visitor.

212
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:58,360
When I wrote my address in her register as
'Darlington Hall', she looked at me with alarm.

213
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,180
She probably assumed that I was a gentleman
who was accustomed to expensive hotels, and

214
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,519
that I would angrily leave her guest house
as soon as I saw my room.

215
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,740
But my room is very clean, with good-sized
windows overlooking the street.

216
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,320
It is perfectly adequate for my needs.

217
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,750
And here, in the quiet of this room, my thoughts
return to that marvellous view this morning

218
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,770
of the English countryside.

219
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,850
I am willing to believe that other countries
offer more dramatic scenery, although I have

220
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,290
never had the privilege of observing those
sights myself.

221
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:41,120
But I am confident that the finest English
countryside possesses a quality that the landscapes

222
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,019
of other nations do not possess, the quality
of 'greatness'.

223
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,730
But what exactly is this 'greatness'?

224
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,639
Wiser heads than mine are needed to answer
such a question, but I believe that the beauty

225
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,710
of our land lies in its calmness, in its lack
of obvious drama.

226
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:07,290
The land, it seems, knows its own beauty,
its own greatness, and feels no need to shout

227
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,820
about it.

228
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:15,210
This reminds me of a question that has caused
much debate in my profession over the years:

229
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,260
what is a 'great' butler?

230
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,920
There have been very few attempts to answer
this question officially, but great butlers

231
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:32,350
do seem to me to share one essential quality,
and that is best described by the word dignity.

232
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,170
Of course, one can enjoy most interesting
debates on the subject of what this 'dignity'

233
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,000
actually is.

234
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
To me, though, it is the butler's ability
not to abandon his professional self under

235
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,260
any circumstances.

236
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:54,010
A great butler wears his professionalism as
a decent gentleman wears his suit; he will

237
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,840
take it off when, and only when, he chooses
to.

238
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,650
And this will always be when he is entirely
alone.

239
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,400
It is sometimes said that butlers only truly
exist in England; other countries have manservants.

240
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,690
I believe this may be true.

241
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,930
Continentals are unable to be butlers because
they are incapable of the emotional self-control

242
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,260
- the dignity - which only the English possess.

243
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,620
For this reason, when you think of a great
butler he must, almost by definition, be an

244
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Englishman.

245
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,190
Some of my colleagues have argued that attempts
to analyse greatness are pointless; one can

246
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,540
recognize immediately whether a person does
or does not have it.

247
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,830
But it is surely our professional responsibility
to think deeply about these things.

248
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,680
In this way we may make every effort to achieve
'dignity' for ourselves.

249
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
***

250
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,830
I have rarely been happy in strange beds.

251
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,890
It took me a long time to fall asleep last
night, and I woke up over an hour ago while

252
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,790
it was still dark.

253
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,040
I tried to return to sleep but this was impossible.

254
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,500
I decided therefore to get up.

255
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:14,580
Now, in these quiet moments as I wait for
the world to awake, I am thinking about Miss

256
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,720
Kenton's letter.

257
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,890
I should perhaps explain that her name is
not 'Miss Kenton' now.

258
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,200
She has been 'Mrs Benn' for the last twenty
years.

259
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,760
However, I am unable to think of her as 'Mrs
Benn', as I have not seen her since she married

260
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,940
and moved to the West Country.

261
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,260
I must continue to call her 'Miss Kenton',
for this is how I have always thought of her.

262
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:47,160
Unfortunately, her letter has given me another
reason for continuing to think of her as 'Miss

263
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Kenton'.

264
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,930
It seems that her marriage has sadly come
to an end.

265
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,740
The letter does not contain details of the
matter, and I would not expect it to.

266
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:02,170
But Miss Kenton clearly says that she has
now moved out of Mr Benn's house in Helston

267
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,110
and is staying in the neighbouring village
of Little Compton.

268
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,470
It is, of course, tragic that her marriage
has ended in failure.

269
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:16,640
Miss Kenton is now a lonely, unhappy, middle-aged
woman and probably greatly regrets her decision

270
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,620
to leave Darlington Hall.

271
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,750
It is easy to see why she would want to return
there now.

272
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,460
It is true that she does not say this directly
in her letter, but she speaks about the old

273
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,020
days at Darlington Hall with such affection
and nostalgia that I am sure that this is

274
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,720
her real message.

275
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,620
Of course, Miss Kenton must realize that times
have changed at Darlington Hall since she

276
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,050
left twenty years ago.

277
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,040
It will be my first duty to emphasize this
when we meet.

278
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,070
I will have to explain that the days of working
with a large staff will almost certainly never

279
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,970
return within our lifetime.

280
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,480
But Miss Kenton is an intelligent woman.

281
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,020
She probably already understands these things.

282
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,780
Miss Kenton's letter reveals at times a sense
of hopelessness at her present situation,

283
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,380
which worries me.

284
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,650
She begins one sentence: Although I have no
idea how I shall usefully fill what remains

285
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,290
of my life...

286
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:26,290
And again, elsewhere, she writes: The rest
of my life stretches out emptily before me.

287
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,390
The tone of most of the letter, however, is
nostalgic.

288
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:36,190
For example, she writes: This whole incident
reminds me of Alice White.

289
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,390
Do you remember her?

290
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,330
Who could forget her awful vowel sounds and
ungrammatical sentences!

291
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,590
Have you any idea what happened to her?

292
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:54,230
I have no idea what happened to Alice White,
although it amused me to remember her.

293
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:00,280
After a very bad start, she became one of
Darlington Hall's most devoted housemaids.

294
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,670
In another part of her letter, Miss Kenton
writes: I was so fond of that view from the

295
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,650
second-floor bedrooms.

296
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,600
I remember the lawn and the hills visible
in the distance.

297
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,040
Is it still like that?

298
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,360
On summer evenings there was a magical quality
to that view.

299
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,690
I will confess to you now that I used to spend
a lot of time in those bedrooms looking out

300
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,960
of the windows.

301
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,520
Then she adds: If this is a painful memory,
forgive me.

302
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,310
But I will never forget standing with you
at one of those bedroom windows.

303
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,120
We were both watching your father.

304
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,150
He was walking backwards and forwards in front
of the summerhouse, looking at the ground.

305
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:52,200
He seemed to be looking for a precious jewel
that he had dropped there - do you remember?

306
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,550
It surprises me that Miss Kenton can still
remember this incident.

307
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,240
It must have occurred on a summer evening
over thirty years ago.

308
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,820
I can clearly remember climbing to the second-floor
landing.

309
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,100
Evening sunlight shone through the half-open
bedroom doors into the dark corridor.

310
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,340
As I made my way along the corridor, I saw
Miss Kenton standing by a window in one of

311
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,990
the bedrooms.

312
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,910
She turned as I was passing and called softly:

313
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,740
'Mr Stevens, do you have a moment?'

314
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,770
As I entered, Miss Kenton turned back to the
window.

315
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,970
Down below, the shadows of the trees were
falling across the lawn.

316
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,850
To the right, the lawn sloped up towards the
summerhouse.

317
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:48,850
And there was my father, walking slowly backwards
and forwards, looking anxiously at the ground.

318
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,570
CHAPTER THREE

319
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,610
Small Errors

320
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:57,280
1922

321
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,160
Miss Kenton and my father arrived at Darlington
Hall at the same time.

322
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,740
This was because the previous housekeeper
and under-butler had decided to marry one

323
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,740
another and leave the profession.

324
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:16,120
My father had, until this time, been butler
to Mr John Silvers at Loughborough House.

325
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,120
When his employer died, my father lost his
job and his accommodation.

326
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,630
Although he was still, of course, a professional
of the highest class, he was now in his seventies

327
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,100
and was showing signs of his age.

328
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,900
He would have found it difficult to find a
new job in competition with younger butlers.

329
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,160
It therefore seemed reasonable to ask my father
to bring his great experience to Darlington

330
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,800
Hall.

331
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,030
One morning, a short time after my father
and Miss Kenton had joined the staff, I was

332
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,420
working at the table in my office.

333
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,450
Suddenly I heard a knock at my door.

334
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,130
I was a little surprised when Miss Kenton
opened the door and entered before I had given

335
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,880
her permission.

336
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,950
She came in holding a large vase of flowers
and said with a smile:

337
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,900
'Mr Stevens, I thought these would brighten
your room a little.'

338
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,700
'I beg your pardon, Miss Kenton?'

339
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,960
'Your room is so dark and cold, Mr Stevens,
and there's such bright sunshine outside.

340
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,770
I thought these would add a touch of colour.'

341
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,830
'That's very kind of you, Miss Kenton.'

342
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,400
She put her vase down on the table in front
of me, then glanced around my office again.

343
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,670
'If you wish, Mr Stevens, I could bring in
some more flowers for you,' she said.

344
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:42,280
'Miss Kenton, I appreciate your kindness,'
I replied.

345
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,810
'But this is not a room of entertainment.

346
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,500
More flowers will not be necessary.'

347
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,490
'But surely, Mr Stevens, there's no need to
keep your room so dark and colourless.'

348
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,770
'I prefer my office to be like this, Miss
Kenton, though I appreciate your thoughts.

349
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,880
In fact, since you are here, there was something
I wished to discuss with you.'

350
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,310
'Oh, really, Mr Stevens?'

351
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,180
'Yes, Miss Kenton, just a small matter.

352
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:19,120
I was walking past the kitchen yesterday when
I heard you calling to someone named William.'

353
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,940
'Did you, Mr Stevens?'

354
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,610
'Indeed, Miss Kenton.

355
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,130
I heard you call several times for "William".

356
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,150
May I ask whom you were talking to?'

357
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,540
'I was talking to your father, Mr Stevens.

358
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,410
There are no other Williams in the house.'

359
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:39,160
'It is an easy error to make,' I said with
a small smile.

360
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,090
'May I ask you, Miss Kenton, to refer to my
father as "Mr Stevens" in future?

361
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,960
I would be very grateful.'

362
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,710
I returned to my work but, to my surprise,
Miss Kenton did not leave.

363
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,610
'Excuse me, Mr Stevens,' she said after a
moment.

364
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,160
'Yes, Miss Kenton.'

365
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,310
'I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

366
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,670
I'm accustomed to using the servants' first
names.

367
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,800
It is usual, I believe.'

368
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,250
'A most understandable error, Miss Kenton.

369
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,600
However, you must understand that you are
speaking to my father, not just another servant.'

370
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,830
'I still don't understand, Mr Stevens.

371
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:30,280
I believe I am the housekeeper of this house,
while your father is the under-butler.'

372
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,580
'He is of course the under-butler, as you
say.

373
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,560
But I am surprised that you have not noticed
that he is, in fact, much more than that.'

374
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,010
'I have obviously been very unobservant, Mr
Stevens.

375
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,890
I have only noticed that your father is an
excellent under-butler.'

376
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,370
'Then you have not observed him carefully
enough, Miss Kenton.

377
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,160
If you had, you would have realized that it
is not appropriate for someone of your youth

378
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,830
and inexperience to call my father by his
first name.'

379
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:09,210
'Mr Stevens, I may not have much experience,
but I am considered by many to be good at

380
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,210
my job.'

381
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,210
'I am sure you are an excellent housekeeper,
Miss Kenton.

382
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,240
But you should have realized that my father
is a man of great experience.

383
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,770
You would learn many things from him if you
observed him more carefully.'

384
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,020
'I am grateful to you for your advice, Mr
Stevens.

385
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:34,490
So do please tell me, what marvellous things
might I learn from observing your father?'

386
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,820
'That is obvious to anyone with eyes, Miss
Kenton.'

387
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,040
'But I thought we had already agreed, Mr Stevens,
that my powers of observation are not as good

388
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,450
as they should be.'

389
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,110
'Miss Kenton, if you believe that you are
already a perfect housekeeper, you will never

390
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,760
reach the top of your profession.

391
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,050
I have noticed, for example, that you are
still often unsure of where to put certain

392
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,750
items.'

393
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,890
Miss Kenton said nothing for a moment.

394
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,910
Indeed, she looked a little upset.

395
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,200
Then she said:

396
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,990
'I had a little difficulty when I first arrived,
but that is surely only normal.'

397
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,180
'Exactly, Miss Kenton.

398
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,721
If you had observed my father, who arrived
in this house a week after you did, you would

399
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:25,100
have seen that he made no mistakes at all.

400
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,600
His house knowledge was perfect from the beginning.'

401
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,120
Miss Kenton seemed to think about this before
saying:

402
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:39,330
'I am sure Mr Stevens senior is very good
at his job, but I assure you, Mr Stevens,

403
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,490
I am very good at mine.

404
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,940
I will remember not to use your father's first
name in future.

405
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,600
Now, please excuse me.'

406
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,680
After this meeting, Miss Kenton made no more
immediate attempts to bring flowers into my

407
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,510
office.

408
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,600
I also noticed that she stopped using my father's
first name.

409
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,230
However, one afternoon two weeks later, she
came into the library where I was working

410
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,230
and said:

411
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,180
'Excuse me, Mr Stevens.

412
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,800
But if you are searching for your dustpan,
it is out in the hall.'

413
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,480
'I beg your pardon, Miss Kenton?'

414
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,770
'Your dustpan, Mr Stevens.

415
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,770
You have left it out here.

416
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,720
Shall I bring it in for you?'

417
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,530
'Miss Kenton, I have not been using a dustpan.'

418
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,320
'Ah, well, then forgive me, Mr Stevens.

419
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,070
I naturally assumed you were using your dustpan
and had left it out in the hall.

420
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,810
I am sorry to have disturbed you.'

421
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,320
She started to leave, but then turned at the
doorway and said:

422
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,140
'Oh, Mr Stevens.

423
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,960
I would return it myself but I am busy at
the moment.

424
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,670
I wonder if you will remember it?'

425
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:56,460
I waited until Miss Kenton had gone upstairs,
then I crossed the library and looked out

426
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,080
into the hall.

427
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,080
There, in the middle of the polished floor,
was a dustpan.

428
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,750
This was an unimportant, but annoying error.

429
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:14,010
The dustpan could have been seen not only
from the five ground-floor doorways, but also

430
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,370
from the stairs and the first-floor landings.

431
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:23,530
Then, as I moved across the hall to pick it
up, I suddenly realized the importance of

432
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,820
this mistake.

433
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,730
My father had been brushing the entrance hall
half an hour earlier.

434
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:35,730
At first, I found it hard to believe that
my father could have made such an error.

435
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:42,610
But I soon reminded myself that everybody
makes mistakes from time to time.

436
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,320
I began, instead, to feel annoyed with Miss
Kenton for exaggerating the importance of

437
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,830
such a small mistake.

438
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:55,180
A week later, as I was coming down the back
corridor from the kitchen, Miss Kenton came

439
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,030
out of her room.

440
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,790
She wanted to tell me that there were remains
of polish on the dining-room silver.

441
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:06,830
'The end of one of the forks is almost black,'
she informed me.

442
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,490
I thanked her for this information, and she
returned to her room.

443
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:17,350
She did not need to say, of course, that my
father was responsible for polishing the silver.

444
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,440
There were probably other similar incidents,
which I have now forgotten, but things soon

445
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,880
reached a climax.

446
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,450
One grey, wet afternoon, while I was polishing
Lord Darlington's sporting cups in the games

447
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,170
room, Miss Kenton entered and said from the
door:

448
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,760
'Mr Stevens, I have just noticed something
outside which puzzles me.'

449
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,710
'What is that, Miss Kenton?'

450
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:47,570
'The Chinaman which normally stands on the
landing is now outside this door.'

451
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,180
'I'm afraid, Miss Kenton, that you are a little
confused.'

452
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,280
'I don't believe I am confused at all, Mr
Stevens.

453
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,080
If you don't believe me, perhaps you will
come and see for yourself?'

454
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,750
'I am busy at present, Miss Kenton.'

455
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,420
'But Mr Stevens, you must come and see for
yourself if you don't believe me.'

456
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,930
'I will look at it later, Miss Kenton.

457
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,260
There is no hurry.'

458
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,380
'Does that mean that you believe me, Mr Stevens?'

459
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,210
'I don't know, Miss Kenton.

460
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,180
I must see for myself.'

461
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,590
'Then come and see.'

462
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,990
'I have already told you, Miss Kenton, I am
busy.'

463
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:29,650
I returned to my business, but Miss Kenton
remained in the doorway, observing me.

464
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,610
Eventually, she said:

465
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,550
'I can see you don't have much more to do,
Mr Stevens.

466
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,640
I'll wait outside for you.'

467
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,900
With those words, she left the room.

468
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,060
I spent as long as I could polishing Lord
Darlington's cups in the games room, thinking

469
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,280
that Miss Kenton would soon become bored with
waiting for me.

470
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,270
Eventually, however, there were no more tasks
for me to do and I had to leave.

471
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:01,700
To my surprise, when I walked out into the
corridor, I saw that Miss Kenton was still

472
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,490
waiting for me.

473
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,940
I turned and walked away from her as quickly
as I could, but she ran and stood in front

474
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,960
of me.

475
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,700
I was forced to stop.

476
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,230
'Mr Stevens,' she said.

477
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,990
'That is the incorrect Chinaman, do you not
agree?'

478
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,490
'Miss Kenton, I am very busy.

479
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:26,290
I am surprised you have nothing better to
do than stand in corridors all day.'

480
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,610
'Mr Stevens, is that the correct Chinaman
or is it not?'

481
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,520
'Miss Kenton, I must ask you to keep your
voice down.'

482
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,990
'And I must ask you, Mr Stevens, to turn around
and look at that Chinaman.'

483
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,960
'Miss Kenton, please!

484
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,960
What would the other employees think if they
heard us shouting at the top of our voices

485
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,139
about Chinamen?'

486
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:55,889
'The fact is, Mr Stevens, all the Chinamen
in this house have been dirty for some time!

487
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,230
And now they are in incorrect positions!'

488
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,120
'Miss Kenton, you are being ridiculous.

489
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,050
Kindly let me pass.'

490
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,980
'Mr Stevens, will you kindly look at the Chinaman
behind you?'

491
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,350
'If it is so important to you, Miss Kenton,
I admit that it is possible that the Chinaman

492
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,410
has been placed incorrectly.

493
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:24,480
But I really cannot understand why you are
so worried about such unimportant errors.'

494
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:32,140
'These errors may be unimportant, Mr Stevens,
but you must realize their larger significance.'

495
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,490
'Miss Kenton, I do not understand you.

496
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,090
Would you kindly let me pass?'

497
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:46,120
'The fact is, Mr Stevens,' she said, 'your
father has too much responsibility for a man

498
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,740
of his age.

499
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,490
He is too old to cope with it.

500
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,680
He is making more and more mistakes.

501
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,860
If you don't take notice of them now, something
much more serious is going to happen.'

502
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:04,000
'Miss Kenton, you are making yourself look
foolish.'

503
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,470
'I'm sorry, Mr Stevens, but I must go on.

504
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:14,660
I believe there are many jobs your father
should not be expected to do at his age.

505
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,820
He should not have to carry heavy trays.

506
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,880
Have you seen the way his hands tremble?

507
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,210
One day soon, a heavy tray will fall from
his hands on to a lady's or gentleman's lap.

508
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:33,270
And furthermore, Mr Stevens - and I am very
sorry to say this - I have noticed your father's

509
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,270
nose.'

510
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,670
'Have you indeed, Miss Kenton?'

511
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,790
'Yes, I have, Mr Stevens.

512
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:46,480
The evening before last I watched your father
walking very slowly towards the dining room

513
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,530
with his tray.

514
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:55,520
I regret to say that I clearly saw a large
drop on the end of his nose hanging over the

515
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
soup bowls.

516
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:08,150
If a lady or gentleman had seen that, Mr Stevens,
I am sure they would have lost their appetite.'

517
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,920
CHAPTER FOUR

518
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,030
An Embarrassing Fall

519
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:19,150
The more I think about it, the less certain
I am that Miss Kenton spoke to me on that

520
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,330
day as boldly as I have just reported.

521
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:28,920
It was still early in our relationship, and
I am sure that she did not say things like:

522
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,830
'These errors may be unimportant, but you
must realize their larger significance.'

523
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:40,220
In fact, I think it was Lord Darlington who
used those words.

524
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,750
March 1923

525
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:50,810
Two months after my conversation with Miss
Kenton about the Chinaman, Lord Darlington

526
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,340
called me into his study.

527
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:00,020
The situation concerning my father had become
very serious because it was after he had had

528
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,620
his accident.

529
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,130
Whenever Lord Darlington wished to speak to
me about something, he often pretended to

530
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,800
be reading a book.

531
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,540
He would wait for me to pass, then he would
look up from his book and say:

532
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,180
'Oh, Stevens.

533
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,250
There was something I meant to say to you.'

534
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:24,870
I am describing this small detail in order
to show that Lord Darlington was a shy and

535
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,940
modest man.

536
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,420
A lot of nonsense has been spoken and written
recently about his lordship.

537
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:37,480
Many reports have criticized the part he played
in this country before and during the war.

538
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,180
They claim that he was a selfish and foolish
man.

539
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,990
Let me say here that all these reports about
him are completely false.

540
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,360
Lord Darlington was a good man with a good
heart.

541
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:56,930
I am proud to have given my best years of
service to such a true gentleman.

542
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:02,940
On this particular afternoon, Lord Darlington
hardly looked up from his book as he asked:

543
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,480
'Your father feeling better now, Stevens?'

544
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,440
'Much better now, thank you, sir.'

545
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,390
'Very pleased to hear that.

546
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,980
Very pleased.'

547
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:18,770
There was a short, uncomfortable pause, then
Lord Darlington said:

548
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:25,480
'I wonder, Stevens, have there been any - well
- signs at all?

549
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,080
Any indications that your father might prefer
an easier life these days?

550
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,660
Work a little less hard, I mean?'

551
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:39,000
'I believe, sir, that you can still completely
depend on him to do his job.

552
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,760
It is true that he has made one or two errors
recently, but none of them has been serious.'

553
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,380
'That's true, Stevens.

554
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,660
But nevertheless, we don't want to see an
accident like that again, do we?

555
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,140
It could happen during dinner, while he was
serving at table.'

556
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,380
'It is possible, sir.'

557
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,800
'Listen, Stevens.

558
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,500
The first guests will be arriving here for
the conference in less than a fortnight.

559
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,610
What happens within this house may be very
important for our country.

560
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,270
I am not exaggerating, Stevens.

561
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,590
We cannot possibly afford to have any accidents
then.'

562
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,420
'Indeed not, sir.'

563
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,190
'I am not suggesting that your father should
leave us, Stevens.

564
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,960
I am simply asking you to reconsider his duties.'

565
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,780
His lordship then looked down again into his
book and said: 'These errors may be unimportant,

566
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,930
Stevens, but you must realize their larger
significance.

567
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:43,610
Another accident might threaten the success
of our conference in two weeks' time.'

568
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,980
'Indeed, sir.

569
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,300
I fully understand.'

570
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,369
Lord Darlington had witnessed my father's
accident himself a week or so earlier.

571
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:58,740
He had been with two guests, a young lady
and gentleman, in the summerhouse and had

572
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,420
seen my father crossing the lawn with a tray
of refreshments.

573
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:09,220
As my father began to climb the stone steps
to the summerhouse, however, he fell.

574
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:15,400
By the time I reached the scene of the accident,
his lordship and his guests had turned my

575
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,600
father on to his side and had tried to make
him comfortable.

576
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:25,950
My father was unconscious, and his face was
strangely grey in colour.

577
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:32,140
With the help of a wheelchair, my father was
transported with difficulty into the house.

578
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:39,610
By the time Doctor Meredith arrived, my father
had woken up and was beginning to feel better.

579
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:45,260
The whole incident was clearly a great embarrassment
to my father, but he soon forgot about it

580
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,840
and returned to work.

581
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,460
It was not easy, therefore, for me to tell
him that it had been decided to reduce his

582
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,370
work load.

583
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,060
He was a proud man.

584
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,690
Another difficulty for me was the fact that
my father and I hardly ever talked to each

585
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,690
other.

586
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:08,540
For several years, even the smallest professional
conversation had seemed to embarrass us.

587
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,430
I had never really understood why.

588
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:17,270
In the end I decided to talk to my father
privately in his room.

589
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:23,050
Early one morning, I climbed up to the top
floor of the house and knocked gently on his

590
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,610
door.

591
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,530
My father was sitting on the edge of his bed
in full uniform.

592
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,050
He had obviously been sitting there for some
time.

593
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,680
'Ah,' I said, and gave a short laugh.

594
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,390
'I thought Father would be up and ready for
the day.'

595
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:45,470
'I've been up and ready for the last three
hours,' he said, looking me up and down rather

596
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,490
coldly.

597
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,020
'I have come here to tell you something, Father.'

598
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,400
'Then be quick.

599
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,450
I haven't all morning to listen to you.'

600
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:01,310
'The fact is, Father has been making a number
of errors recently.

601
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:06,840
His lordship believes - and I agree with him
- that he is working too hard for a man of

602
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,750
his age.

603
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,350
His lordship is very worried about the smooth
running of this house.

604
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:20,360
He does not want any more unfortunate accidents,
especially during next week's important international

605
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,850
conference.'

606
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,610
My father's face, in the half-light, showed
no emotion.

607
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:31,580
'It has been decided, therefore, that Father
should no longer have to serve at table.'

608
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:41,230
'I have served at table every day for the
last fifty-four years,' my father said slowly

609
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,610
and calmly.

610
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:49,360
'Furthermore,' I continued, 'it has been decided
that Father should not carry trays.

611
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,430
I have here a list of his new duties.'

612
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:59,360
I did not wish, for some reason, to hand him
the piece of paper directly, so I placed it

613
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,820
on the end of his bed.

614
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,810
My father glanced at it, then looked at me
again.

615
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,920
Eventually he said:

616
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,260
'I only fell that time because of the steps.

617
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,630
They're not straight.'

618
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,220
'Indeed.

619
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,600
Now, I hope that Father will study this sheet
of new duties.

620
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,990
Good morning.'

621
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:31,580
That summer evening which Miss Kenton mentioned
in her letter came very soon after that conversation.

622
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,520
Indeed, it may have been the evening of that
same day.

623
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,470
As I have said before, I can remember the
evening sunlight shining through the open

624
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,640
bedroom doors into the dark corridor.

625
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,980
And as I was walking past the bedrooms, Miss
Kenton called to me.

626
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,110
I stood next to her by the window and looked
down.

627
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:58,450
We could see my father standing by the stone
steps in front of the summerhouse.

628
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:04,210
A soft wind blew through his hair and there
was a deep frown on his face.

629
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:10,369
Then, as we watched, he walked very slowly
up the steps.

630
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:14,950
At the top he turned and came back down, a
little faster.

631
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,300
He repeated this several times, his eyes never
once leaving the ground.

632
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,940
It was exacdy as Miss Kenton describes it
in her letter: He seemed to be looking for

633
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:33,560
a precious jewel that he had dropped there.

634
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
***

635
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,760
Some people might consider me to have been
rather insensitive when I spoke to my father

636
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,000
about his declining abilities.

637
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,330
But the fact is, I had to deal with the problem
in an impersonal and businesslike manner - as

638
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:54,300
I am sure you will agree when I have explained
the situation in more detail.

639
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,670
Lord Darlington had been preparing for the
conference of March 1923 for many years.

640
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:06,500
He had made his first trip to Berlin in 1920,
and was unhappy when he returned to Darlington

641
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Hall.

642
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,910
When I asked him how he had enjoyed his trip,
he said:

643
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,610
'Upsetting, Stevens.

644
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,310
Deeply upsetting.

645
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:19,320
It is not right for us to treat a defeated
enemy like this.

646
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,100
The war ended two years ago.

647
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,050
We are making the people of Germany suffer
too much.

648
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,350
It is not like the British to be so unforgiving.'

649
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:36,100
After that, Lord Darlington spent more and
more time trying to help the German people.

650
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,790
Powerful and famous gentlemen became regular
visitors to the house.

651
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:48,650
Many of them came in secret, so I am unable
to reveal their names to you.

652
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:55,030
Some of the guests were so secret that I was
not permitted to tell the staff who they were.

653
00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:03,580
However - and I say this with pride - his
lordship never hid things from me.

654
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:10,350
Over the following two years, his lordship
and a close friend of his, Sir David Cardinal,

655
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:15,610
became the leaders of a powerful and important
group of people who all agreed that the people

656
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,670
of Germany had suffered enough.

657
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:24,310
They believed that if the economic crisis
in Germany became any worse, all of Europe

658
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,320
would be in danger.

659
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,080
By the beginning of 1922, his lordship had
a clear plan.

660
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,700
He wanted an 'unofficial' international conference
at Darlington Hall.

661
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:44,380
He would invite people from European governments
who agreed with his ideas about helping Germany.

662
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,109
After this conference, these people would
return to their countries and attempt to change

663
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:53,480
their governments' attitudes towards Germany.

664
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,410
As the date for the conference approached,
the pressures on me began to increase.

665
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:03,910
It was my responsibility to make sure that
nothing went wrong.

666
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,660
If any of the guests were, for some reason,
dissatisfied with their stay at Darlington

667
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,680
Hall, it could threaten the success of the
conference.

668
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,040
Great damage might be done to the future peace
of Europe.

669
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,570
However, it was not possible for me to plan
things as carefully as I wanted.

670
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:29,280
I was aware that there would be twenty guests
- eighteen gentlemen and two ladies.

671
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,430
Each guest, however, was going to arrive with
a team of secretaries and servants, and nobody

672
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,910
knew exactly how many.

673
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:41,510
It was impossible for me, therefore, to know
how many rooms would be needed.

674
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:47,600
Furthermore, a number of guests would be arriving
some time before the conference, but nobody

675
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,750
knew the exact dates of these arrivals.

676
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,109
I prepared for the conference like a general
preparing for a battle.

677
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:02,410
I produced a staff plan, and held a special
meeting with everybody who worked in the house.

678
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:07,570
'I know you all have a lot of extra work to
do,' I told them.

679
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:13,869
'We are all under great pressure, but you
can take great pride in performing your duties

680
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:15,840
in the days ahead.

681
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:21,190
It is possible that history will be made under
this roof!'

682
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,760
The staff knew that I was not the kind of
person to make exaggerated statements.

683
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,790
They understood that something extraordinary
was going to take place.

684
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,940
This was the general atmosphere of Darlington
Hall at the time of my father's accident.

685
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,730
It was only two weeks before the conference,
and I had many other urgent problems to think

686
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,730
about.

687
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:49,080
You will understand, therefore, why I might
have seemed a little insensitive with my father

688
00:49:49,080 --> 00:50:04,760
when I informed him of the reduction in his
duties.

689
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
CHAPTER FIVE

690
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,800
The Birds and Bees

691
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:17,190
In the busy days just before the conference,
there was a great change in my father's behaviour.

692
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:22,460
He had a trolley loaded with cleaning equipment,
teapots, cups and saucers.

693
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:27,710
He seemed filled with a strange, youthful
energy, and he pushed his trolley all around

694
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,270
the house.

695
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:34,490
He moved so quickly that a stranger might
have thought that there were several men pushing

696
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:39,440
trolleys around Darlington Hall, not just
one.

697
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:45,290
The increasing pressure of the days just before
the conference affected Miss Kenton, too,

698
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,720
although in a completely different way.

699
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,810
I remember, for example, meeting her in the
back corridor.

700
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:59,120
I reminded her that the sheets for the bedrooms
on the upper floor needed to be ready.

701
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:05,290
'The matter is perfectly under control, Mr
Stevens,' she replied.

702
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:11,070
I began to move away, but Miss Kenton took
one more step towards me with an angry expression

703
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,320
on her face.

704
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,900
'Unfortunately, Mr Stevens, I am extremely
busy now,' she said.

705
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,540
'I wish I had as much spare time as you do.

706
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:28,109
Then perhaps I too could happily wander about
this house and remind you of tasks that you

707
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:30,510
have perfectly under control.'

708
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,820
'Now, Miss Kenton, there is no need to be
so bad-tempered.

709
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,540
I simply wanted to remind you...'

710
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,270
'This is the fourth or fifth time this week,
Mr Stevens, that you have reminded me to do

711
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:47,220
something that I have already done,' she interrupted
me.

712
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:53,080
'It is very strange to see you with so much
spare time that you have nothing better to

713
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
do.'

714
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:01,400
'Miss Kenton, you must be very inexperienced
if you think that I have any spare time.

715
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:08,320
I hope that, in future years, you will understand
more clearly how difficult it is to organize

716
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,860
a great house like this.'

717
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:17,369
'You are always talking about my "great inexperience",
Mr Stevens, but have you noticed anything

718
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,460
wrong with my work?

719
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,150
If you had, I'm sure you would have told me
about it before now.

720
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,540
Now, I have a lot of work to do.

721
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,420
I would be grateful if you would stop interrupting
me like this.

722
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:37,180
If you have so much spare time, I suggest
that you go for a walk outside and get some

723
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,180
fresh air.'

724
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,390
With those words, she marched past me along
the corridor.

725
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:49,230
I was so surprised that I did not know what
to do at first.

726
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:55,920
Then, deciding that it was best not to say
anything, I continued on my way.

727
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,150
I had, however, almost reached the kitchen
doorway when I heard the sound of angry footsteps

728
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,380
coming back towards me again.

729
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:12,600
'In fact, Mr Stevens,' she called, 'I would
be grateful if, in future, you did not speak

730
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,450
to me directly at all.

731
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:19,460
If it is necessary to communicate with me,
please use a messenger.

732
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:23,359
Or you may like to write a note and have it
sent to me.

733
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,640
Now, I must return to my work.

734
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:32,710
And you can continue to wander around the
house criticizing people for no reason!'

735
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:37,880
Although I was annoyed by Miss Kenton's behaviour,
I had no time to think about it because the

736
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,120
first guests had arrived.

737
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:45,750
Two Foreign Office officials and Lord Darlington's
friend, Sir David Cardinal, had arrived before

738
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,720
the other guests to discuss the conference.

739
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,150
As I went in and out of the various rooms
in which these four gentlemen sat, I could

740
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:58,960
not avoid hearing parts of their conversation.

741
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,940
They seemed to be talking most of the time
about one man - an extremely important Frenchman

742
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,180
whom I shall call Monsieur Dupont.

743
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:14,690
On one occasion, I came into the smoking room
and heard one of the gentlemen saying:

744
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:20,310
'The future of Europe depends on persuading
Dupont that we are right.'

745
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:28,060
In the middle of these discussions, his lordship
asked me to perform a rather unusual task.

746
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:35,380
He called me into his study, sat down at his
desk and, as usual, pretended to start reading

747
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,710
a book.

748
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,960
'Oh, Stevens,' he began.

749
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,540
Then he did not seem to know how to continue,
for he turned a page of his book and fell

750
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,290
silent.

751
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:51,700
A few moments later he tried again.

752
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,000
'Stevens, I realize that this is a strange
request.'

753
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,770
'Sir?'

754
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:02,349
'It's just that I have so much to think about
at present.'

755
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:05,640
'I would be very glad to assist, sir.'

756
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,770
'I'm sorry to have to ask you to do a thing
like this, Stevens.

757
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,470
I know you must be extremely busy yourself.

758
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,820
But I can't think of any other solution.'

759
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,820
He studied the book in front of him for several
long seconds before continuing, without looking

760
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,870
up:

761
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:27,300
'You are familiar, I assume, with the facts
of life.'

762
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,390
'Sir?'

763
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:31,099
'The facts of life, Stevens.

764
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:34,890
Birds, bees, that sort of thing.'

765
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,700
'I'm afraid I don't quite understand, sir.'

766
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,800
'Let me be frank, Stevens.

767
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,410
Sir David is a very old friend of mine.

768
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:49,500
He's brought his son, Reginald, to our conference
as his secretary.

769
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,920
Young Reginald is engaged to be married.'

770
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,080
'Yes, sir.'

771
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,840
'Sir David has been trying to tell his son
the facts of life for the last five years.

772
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,840
The young man is now twenty-three.'

773
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,520
'Indeed, sir.'

774
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,340
'Well, Stevens, this is the problem.

775
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:13,630
Sir David has asked me, as his oldest friend,
to tell young Reginald about the facts of

776
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,090
life.

777
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,510
Sir David himself is nervous about doing it.

778
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:24,000
He thinks it would be much better if I performed
the task.

779
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,020
The trouble is, I'm so busy with this conference.'

780
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,000
His lordship paused and went on studying the
page.

781
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,090
'Do I understand, sir, that you wish me to
give young Mr Cardinal the necessary information?'

782
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,580
'If you don't mind, Stevens.

783
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,410
It would be a great help.

784
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:47,869
Sir David continues to ask me every couple
of hours if I've done it yet.'

785
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:49,880
'I see, sir.

786
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,710
It must be very difficult for you.'

787
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:57,960
'Of course, I realize what an awkward task
this is, Stevens.'

788
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,000
'I will do my best, sir,' I assured his lordship.

789
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,720
'It might, however, be difficult for me to
find the right moment to deliver the information.'

790
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,060
'I'd be grateful if you even tried, Stevens.

791
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,190
It's very decent of you.

792
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:18,770
But listen, there's no need to go into great
detail.

793
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,080
Just give him the basic facts, that's all.'

794
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:30,619
An hour after my conversation with Lord Darlington,
I noticed young Mr Cardinal alone in the library.

795
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:36,050
He was sitting at one of the writing tables,
working on some documents.

796
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:41,160
Deciding to perform my awkward task as quickly
as possible, I entered the library and gave

797
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,500
a little cough.

798
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:48,100
'Excuse me, sir, but I have a message for
you,' I said.

799
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:52,570
'Oh, really?' said Mr Cardinal, looking up
from his papers.

800
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,060
'From Father?'

801
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,560
'Yes, sir.

802
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,790
In an indirect sort of way.'

803
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:03,030
The young gentleman reached down into the
black bag at his feet, brought out a notebook

804
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,630
and pencil and said:

805
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,849
'I'm ready, Stevens.'

806
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,870
I coughed again and said:

807
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:15,210
'Sir David wishes you to know, sir, that ladies
and gentlemen are different in a number of

808
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:17,119
ways.'

809
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:22,990
I must have paused a little to consider the
wording of my next sentence, because Mr Cardinal

810
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:23,990
said:

811
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,480
'I am aware of that, Stevens.'

812
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,000
'You are aware, sir?'

813
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,020
'My father constantly underestimates me, Stevens.

814
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,490
I've done quite a lot of reading on the subject.'

815
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,940
'Really, sir.

816
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,420
Then, in that case, perhaps my message is
unnecessary.'

817
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:47,740
'You can assure Father that I have discovered
everything I need to know.

818
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,340
This bag is full of notes I have made on the
subject.'

819
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,840
'Indeed, sir?'

820
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,900
'Unless, of course, Father has new information
he wants me to think about.

821
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,610
Is there anything more, for example, on this
Dupont fellow?'

822
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:09,940
'I believe not, sir,' I said, attempting to
hide my disappointment.

823
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:15,119
I thought I had successfully completed the
task, but found instead that I hadn't even

824
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,810
started it.

825
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:22,810
However, before I could make another attempt
on the subject, Mr Cardinal rose to his feet

826
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,890
and said:

827
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:28,380
'Well, I think I'll go outside for some fresh
air, Stevens.

828
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,680
Thanks for your help.'

829
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:36,900
I had intended to speak again to Mr Cardinal
immediately, but that afternoon - two days

830
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:42,960
earlier than expected - Mr Lewis, the American
senator, arrived.

831
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,520
More guests arrived the next morning: two
ladies from Germany who had brought with them

832
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,270
a large team of servants as well as a great
many trunks.

833
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:56,020
Then, in the afternoon, an Italian gentleman
arrived.

834
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:02,670
He was accompanied by a servant, a secretary,
an adviser and two security men.

835
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:07,260
Several more guests arrived the following
day, and Darlington Hall was already filled

836
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,150
with people of all nationalities two days
before the conference began.

837
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:17,369
Although the guests were always polite to
each other, there was a strange atmosphere

838
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:19,220
in the house.

839
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:24,640
The visiting servants seemed to look at one
another very coldly, and my own staff were

840
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,600
glad to be too busy to spend much time with
them.

841
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:35,950
One afternoon, while I was becoming increasingly
busy with the many demands made of me, I glanced

842
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,820
out of a window and saw young Mr Cardinal.

843
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,890
He was taking some fresh air around the grounds.

844
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,930
Although I had much more important things
on my mind, I immediately thought of the task

845
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:54,359
which Lord Darlington had asked me to perform,
and which I had not yet completed.

846
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:59,390
I decided that this was a suitable time and
place for me to deliver the message.

847
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:05,090
I crossed the grass quickly and waited behind
a bush until I heard Mr Cardinal's footsteps

848
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,780
along the path that bordered the lawn.

849
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:14,350
Unfortunately, I misjudged the timing of my
appearance from behind the bush.

850
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:20,410
I had intended to come out on to the path
while Mr Cardinal was still some distance

851
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,720
away.

852
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,420
I could have pretended to notice him for the
first time, and started a conversation with

853
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,710
him in a natural manner.

854
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:35,340
However, I moved out from behind the bush
a little too late, and, I regret to say, I

855
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,840
frightened the young gentleman.

856
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,970
He stepped backwards in alarm, holding his
black bag tightly.

857
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,320
'I'm very sorry, sir.'

858
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,320
'Stevens!

859
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,560
You gave me a shock.'

860
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:51,070
'I'm very sorry, sir,' I repeated.

861
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,480
'But I have a message to deliver to you.

862
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,780
If I may speak directly, sir, You will notice
the geese not far from us.'

863
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,100
'Geese?'

864
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,310
He looked around, a little confused.

865
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,740
'And also the flowers and bushes.

866
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:14,859
This is not, in fact, the best time of year
to see them, but you will appreciate, sir,

867
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:22,230
that in spring we will see a change - a very
special sort of change - in these surroundings.'

868
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:26,560
'Yes, I'm sure this is not the best time of
year to see the grounds.

869
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:32,680
But frankly, Stevens, I wasn't paying much
attention to the beauty of nature.

870
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,690
It's all rather worrying.

871
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:38,470
That Monsieur Dupont has arrived in a very
bad mood.'

872
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:42,260
'Monsieur Dupont has arrived here at this
house, sir?'

873
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,090
'About half an hour ago.

874
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,190
He's in a terrible temper.'

875
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,480
'Excuse me, sir.

876
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,720
I must attend to the matter immediately.'

877
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,480
'Of course, Stevens.

878
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,690
It was kind of you to come out here and talk
to me.'

879
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:00,800
'Please excuse me, sir, but I have not quite
finished my message on the topic of - as you

880
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,790
say - the beauty of nature.

881
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:07,839
If you would allow me to continue on another
occasion, I would be most grateful.'

882
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,500
'I shall look forward to it, Stevens.

883
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,210
Although I'm more interested in fish than
flowers and geese.

884
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,370
I know all about fish.'

885
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:22,670
'All living creatures will be relevant to
our future discussion, sir.

886
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,730
However, you must now please excuse me.

887
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:30,240
I had no idea that Monsieur Dupont had arrived.'

888
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,580
With those words I hurried back to the house.

889
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:39,640
Monsieur Dupont was a tall, elegant gentleman
with a grey beard.

890
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:45,210
He had arrived in the sort of clothes that
European gentlemen often wear on their holidays.

891
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:51,430
As Mr Cardinal had said, Monsieur Dupont had
not arrived in a good temper.

892
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,660
A lot of things had upset him since his arrival
in England.

893
01:03:54,660 --> 01:04:01,109
Among other things, he had painful sores on
his feet after sightseeing in London.

894
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:06,859
I told his manservant to speak to Miss Kenton,
but this did not prevent Monsieur Dupont from

895
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:09,080
shouting at me every few hours:

896
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,080
'Butler!

897
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,150
I need some more bandages!'

898
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:17,349
His mood seemed to improve, however, when
he saw Mr Lewis.

899
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:21,790
He and the American senator greeted each other
as old colleagues.

900
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:27,230
They went everywhere together, chatting quietly
or laughing about old memories.

901
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,250
The other guests, meanwhile, did not go near
Monsieur Dupont.

902
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:37,030
They seemed suspicious of him, which somehow
seemed to emphasize his importance to the

903
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:41,040
conference.

904
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,640
CHAPTER SIX

905
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,880
The Conference

906
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,520
The conference began on a rainy morning during
the last week of March.

907
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:57,010
On the first morning, I had to go constantly
in and out of the drawing room, where all

908
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:00,900
the serious, dark-jacketed gentlemen had gathered.

909
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:05,010
I noticed that Monsieur Dupont did not speak
very much.

910
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:11,250
Once, while I was leaving the room in the
middle of a speech by a German gentleman,

911
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,330
Monsieur Dupont rose to his feet and followed
me out.

912
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:19,290
'Butler,' he said, as soon as we were in the
hall.

913
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:23,750
'I wonder if I could have the bandages on
my feet changed.

914
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:29,599
They are so uncomfortable that I can hardly
listen to these gentlemen.'

915
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,810
I sent a messenger to ask Miss Kenton for
assistance, then left Monsieur Dupont sitting

916
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,760
in the games room.

917
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,450
However, just as I was going to continue my
duties, the first footman came down the stairs

918
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,110
towards me.

919
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:49,230
He informed me that my father had suddenly
become very ill upstairs.

920
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:54,270
I hurried up to the first floor and, when
I reached the landing, I saw something very

921
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,190
strange.

922
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:58,890
My father was at the far end of the corridor.

923
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:03,980
He was kneeling on the floor with both hands
on the trolley.

924
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:09,000
He had bowed his head and seemed to be staring
at something on the carpet.

925
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,190
He did not move at all.

926
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:15,950
Two housemaids were standing beside him, not
knowing what to do.

927
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:21,010
I went to my father, released his hands from
their grip on the trolley and gently lowered

928
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,200
him on to the floor.

929
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,860
His eyes were closed, and his face was covered
in sweat.

930
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:33,730
I called for more help, and my father was
eventually put in a wheelchair and taken up

931
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,980
to his room.

932
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:40,640
When my father was in bed, I did not know
what to do.

933
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:46,109
I did not want to leave him but, on the other
hand, I was too busy to stay.

934
01:06:46,109 --> 01:06:51,360
As I hesitated in the doorway, Miss Kenton
appeared at my side and said:

935
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,710
'Mr Stevens, I'm not as busy as you are.

936
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,460
If you like, I can look after your father.

937
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,260
I'll bring Doctor Meredith up and tell you
if he has anything important to say.'

938
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:10,060
'Thank you, Miss Kenton,' I said, and I went
downstairs.

939
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:14,830
I returned to the drawing room and was immediately
busy serving the guests tea and coffee.

940
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:22,050
A short time later, as I was leaving the drawing
room with an empty teapot in my hand, Miss

941
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,950
Kenton stopped me and said:

942
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:28,430
'Mr Stevens, Doctor Meredith is leaving now.'

943
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:32,050
The doctor was putting on his hat and coat
in the hall when I arrived.

944
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,930
The teapot was still in my hand.

945
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:38,310
'Your father's not good,' he said.

946
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:42,710
'If he gets worse, call me again immediately.'

947
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:47,060
I thanked the doctor and showed him out.

948
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,060
***

949
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:52,640
The next day, the discussions in the drawing
room were much more serious.

950
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,710
Several of the guests seemed to be getting
angry with Monsieur Dupont and were making

951
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,460
bold accusations against him.

952
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:01,580
The French gentleman did not reply.

953
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:06,260
He just sat quietly in his armchair and stroked
his beard.

954
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:11,109
Whenever there was a break in the conference,
Mr Lewis took Monsieur Dupont away to a quiet

955
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:14,580
corner and whispered to him in private.

956
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:18,849
Meanwhile, my father's condition remained
the same.

957
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:25,750
When I had a spare moment, which was not often,
I went up to his room and found him asleep.

958
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:31,440
I did not, therefore, have a chance to talk
to him until the second evening.

959
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,329
On that occasion, too, he was sleeping when
I entered the room.

960
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:39,529
But the housemaid stood up when she saw me
and began to shake my father's shoulder.

961
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:40,529
'Foolish girl!'

962
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:41,529
I said.

963
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:44,469
'What do you think you are doing?'

964
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:52,480
'Mr Stevens asked me to wake him if you returned,
sir,' she replied, and shook my father's shoulder

965
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,480
again.

966
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,540
My father opened his eyes, turned his head
a little and looked at me.

967
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:04,440
'I hope Father is feeling better now,' I said.

968
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,479
He stared at me for a moment, then asked:

969
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:13,009
'Everything under control downstairs?'

970
01:09:13,009 --> 01:09:17,099
'It is very busy in the kitchen at the moment,
as Father can imagine.'

971
01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:21,799
An impatient look crossed my father's face.

972
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:27,869
'But is everything under control?' he said
again.

973
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:31,909
'Yes, I can assure Father that it is.

974
01:09:31,909 --> 01:09:34,790
I'm glad that Father is feeling better.'

975
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:42,409
Very slowly, he took his arms from under the
bedclothes and stared tiredly at the backs

976
01:09:42,409 --> 01:09:44,369
of his hands.

977
01:09:44,369 --> 01:09:47,429
He continued to do this for some time.

978
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:52,960
'I'm glad Father is feeling so much better,'
I repeated.

979
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,329
'Now really, I should get back.

980
01:09:56,329 --> 01:10:00,909
As I say, it is very busy in the kitchen at
the moment.'

981
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:06,420
He went on looking at his hands for a moment.

982
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,019
Then he said slowly:

983
01:10:08,019 --> 01:10:14,519
'I hope I've been a good father to you.'

984
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:16,739
I laughed a little and said:

985
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:20,449
'I'm so glad you're feeling better now.'

986
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:24,349
'I'm proud of you.

987
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:27,150
You're a good son.

988
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:31,260
I hope I've been a good father to you.

989
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,920
I suppose I haven't.'

990
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:40,190
'I'm afraid we're extremely busy now, but
we can talk again in the morning.'

991
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:43,769
My father continued to look at his hands.

992
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:47,570
He seemed to be slightly annoyed with them.

993
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:53,360
'I'm so glad you're feeling better now,' I
said again, and left the room.

994
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
***

995
01:10:54,360 --> 01:11:00,420
At the second and final dinner of the conference,
the guests seemed friendlier and more relaxed

996
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,510
than they had throughout the previous days.

997
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:07,949
I and my staff served much more wine than
we had before.

998
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:13,329
At the end of the dinner Lord Darlington rose
to make a speech.

999
01:11:13,329 --> 01:11:18,619
He thanked his guests for coming to the conference,
and proceeded to talk for a long time about

1000
01:11:18,619 --> 01:11:22,340
his hopes for a better future for Europe.

1001
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:27,469
When he had finally sat down, everybody was
surprised to see Monsieur Dupont rise to his

1002
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:28,989
feet.

1003
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:32,179
There was immediate silence in the room.

1004
01:11:32,179 --> 01:11:39,190
He thanked Lord Darlington for his hard work,
and everybody in the room voiced quiet approval.

1005
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:45,010
He then surprised everybody by criticizing
the American senator, Mr Lewis, for trying

1006
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:50,090
to create trouble between him and the other
guests at the conference.

1007
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:55,670
When he eventually sat down, there was an
awkward silence.

1008
01:11:55,670 --> 01:12:02,139
Finally Mr Lewis rose to his feet and proceeded
to criticize Lord Darlington for not understanding

1009
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:07,090
the problems of the real world - for not being
a professional, like him.

1010
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:13,949
'The world is too complicated for true gentlemen
to understand,' he said.

1011
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:17,210
'It's time for politicians and businessmen
to take control.'

1012
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:25,159
When he had finished speaking, there was a
shocked silence and no one moved.

1013
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:31,090
Then Lord Darlington stood up and defended
himself against Mr Lewis's attacks.

1014
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:35,489
He talked about honour, justice and goodness.

1015
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:44,709
'Professionalism,' he said, 'is just another
word for greedy dishonesty.'

1016
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:50,580
Everybody in the room clapped with great enthusiasm
at this part of his lordship's speech, except

1017
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,590
for Mr Lewis.

1018
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:58,679
He just looked into his wine glass and shook
his head with a tired smile.

1019
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:03,920
Just at that moment, I became aware of the
first footman beside me.

1020
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,449
'Miss Kenton would like a word with you, sir,'
he whispered.

1021
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:11,959
'She's just outside the door.'

1022
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:16,239
I left as quietly as possible while his lordship
was still speaking.

1023
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,310
Miss Kenton looked rather upset.

1024
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:24,079
'Your father has become very ill, Mr Stevens,'
she said.

1025
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:29,909
'I've called for Doctor Meredith, but I believe
he may be a little late.'

1026
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:34,550
I must have looked a little confused, for
Miss Kenton then said:

1027
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:39,099
'Mr Stevens, he really is in a bad state.

1028
01:13:39,099 --> 01:13:40,889
You had better come and see him.'

1029
01:13:40,889 --> 01:13:43,239
'I only have a moment.

1030
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:46,349
The gentlemen will be needing me in the smoking
room very soon.'

1031
01:13:46,349 --> 01:13:47,469
'Of course.

1032
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:56,429
But you must come now, Mr Stevens, otherwise
you may deeply regret it later.'

1033
01:13:56,429 --> 01:14:02,989
When I arrived in my father's room, Mrs Mortimer,
the cook, was standing by his bed.

1034
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:06,790
My father's face had gone a dull, reddish
colour.

1035
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:11,420
I had never seen that colour in a living person's
face before.

1036
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:18,590
I looked at my father for a moment, touched
his forehead slightly, then withdrew my hand.

1037
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:24,880
'In my opinion,' Mrs Mortimer said, 'he's
suffered a stroke.

1038
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,679
'With that she began to cry.

1039
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,719
I turned away and said to Miss Kenton:

1040
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,989
'This is most upsetting.

1041
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:35,900
Nevertheless, I must now return downstairs.'

1042
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,810
'Of course, Mr Stevens.

1043
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:42,530
I will tell you when the doctor arrives.'

1044
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:47,849
I hurried downstairs and was in time to see
the gentlemen going into the smoking room.

1045
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:53,750
There was now a genuine atmosphere of celebration
among the guests as I moved around the crowded

1046
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,239
smoking room with my tray.

1047
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:01,639
I had just finished serving a glass to a gentleman
when a voice behind me said:

1048
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:06,690
'Ah, Stevens, you're interested in fish, you
say.'

1049
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:11,440
I turned to find the young Mr Cardinal smiling
happily at me.

1050
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,820
I smiled also and said:

1051
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,780
'Fish, sir?'

1052
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:21,469
'When I was young, I used to keep tropical
fish in a tank...

1053
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:24,690
My God, Stevens, are you all right?'

1054
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:26,420
I smiled again.

1055
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:29,369
'Quite all right, thank you, sir.'

1056
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:35,329
'As you so rightly explained, I really should
come back here in spring.

1057
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:37,679
Darlington Hall must be lovely then.

1058
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,530
The last time I was here...'

1059
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:43,159
Mr Cardinal stopped again and looked at me.

1060
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:47,429
'Are you sure you're all right, Stevens?'

1061
01:15:47,429 --> 01:15:50,019
'Perfectly all right, thank you, sir.'

1062
01:15:50,019 --> 01:15:52,739
'Not feeling unwell, are you?'

1063
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:54,920
'Not at all, sir.

1064
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,550
Please excuse me.'

1065
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:00,639
I proceeded to serve drink to some other guests.

1066
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,810
Then I felt something touch my elbow and turned
to find Lord Darlington.

1067
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,530
'Stevens, are you all right?'

1068
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,010
'Yes, sir.

1069
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,010
Perfectly.'

1070
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:14,070
'You seem to be crying.'

1071
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:18,440
I laughed and, taking out a handkerchief,
I quickly wiped my face.

1072
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,699
'I'm sorry, sir.

1073
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:22,820
The strains of a hard day.'

1074
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:26,239
'Yes, it's been hard work.'

1075
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:31,690
I was continuing around the room when I saw
Miss Kenton standing in the doorway.

1076
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,849
She signalled for me to go over to her.

1077
01:16:34,849 --> 01:16:40,229
I began to make my way towards the doors but,
before I could reach them, Monsieur Dupont

1078
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,060
touched my arm.

1079
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:47,739
'Butler,' he said, 'I wonder if you would
find me some fresh bandages.

1080
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:49,409
My feet are hurting again.'

1081
01:16:49,409 --> 01:16:52,310
'Yes, sir.'

1082
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:57,670
As I moved towards the doors, I realized Monsieur
Dupont was following me.

1083
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:59,079
I turned and said:

1084
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:03,380
'I will come and find you, sir, as soon as
I have the bandages.'

1085
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,090
'Please hurry, butler.

1086
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,489
I am in pain.'

1087
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:08,019
'Yes, sir.

1088
01:17:08,019 --> 01:17:11,099
I'm very sorry, sir.'

1089
01:17:11,099 --> 01:17:17,499
As I entered the hall, Miss Kenton walked
silently towards the stairs.

1090
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,460
Then she turned and said:

1091
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:23,920
'Mr Stevens, I'm very sorry.

1092
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,389
Your father died about four minutes ago.'

1093
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:30,670
'I see.'

1094
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:34,099
She looked at her hands, then up at my face.

1095
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:40,010
'Mr Stevens, I'm very sorry,' she said.

1096
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,449
Then she added:

1097
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:44,929
'I wish there was something I could say.'

1098
01:17:44,929 --> 01:17:48,250
'There is no need, Miss Kenton.'

1099
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:52,460
'Doctor Meredith has not arrived yet.'

1100
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,070
For a moment she bowed her head.

1101
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,150
She seemed to be crying.

1102
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:01,539
But almost immediately she looked up again
and said in a steady voice:

1103
01:18:01,539 --> 01:18:04,710
'Will you come up and see him?'

1104
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:08,420
'I'm very busy now, Miss Kenton.

1105
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,310
Soon, perhaps.'

1106
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:15,979
'Then, Mr Stevens, will you permit me to close
his eyes?'

1107
01:18:15,979 --> 01:18:20,030
'I would be most grateful, Miss Kenton.'

1108
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:27,570
She began to climb the stairs, but I stopped
her and said: 'Miss Kenton, please don't think

1109
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:32,190
that I'm cold-hearted because I'm not coming
up to see my father at this moment.

1110
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:37,679
You see, I know my father would have wished
me to continue working just now.'

1111
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,130
'Of course, Mr Stevens.'

1112
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:45,260
I turned away and re-entered the smoking room.

1113
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:51,340
As I was moving among the guests with my tray,
Monsieur Dupont touched my shoulder and said:

1114
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,460
'Butler, have you found my bandages yet?'

1115
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,880
'I'm very sorry, sir.'

1116
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,280
'What's the problem, butler?

1117
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,579
Why haven't you found them yet?'

1118
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:04,499
'Sir, a doctor is on his way.'

1119
01:19:04,499 --> 01:19:06,559
'Ah, very good!

1120
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:08,639
You called a doctor.'

1121
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:13,349
Monsieur Dupont turned away and continued
his conversation.

1122
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:17,920
A short time later, a footman approached me
and said:

1123
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,130
'Miss Kenton would like to have a word with
you, sir.'

1124
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:28,300
I made my way towards the doors, but noticed
that Monsieur Dupont was guarding them.

1125
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,079
'Butler, is the doctor here?' he asked.

1126
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:34,989
'I am just going to find out, sir.

1127
01:19:34,989 --> 01:19:36,590
I won't be a moment.'

1128
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:38,820
'I am in pain.'

1129
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,099
'I'm very sorry, sir.

1130
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:44,139
The doctor should not be long now.'

1131
01:19:44,139 --> 01:19:48,290
This time, Monsieur Dupont followed me out
of the door.

1132
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:51,360
Miss Kenton was again standing in the hall.

1133
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,960
'Mr Stevens,' she said.

1134
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:58,170
'Doctor Meredith has arrived and gone upstairs.'

1135
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:03,440
She had spoken in a low voice, but Monsieur
Dupont behind me immediately said:

1136
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,099
'Ah, good!'

1137
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:06,800
I turned to him and said:

1138
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,840
'Perhaps you would follow me, sir.'

1139
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,380
I led Monsieur Dupont into the games room,
then returned to the hallway.

1140
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,309
Miss Kenton was still waiting for me.

1141
01:20:18,309 --> 01:20:23,289
Without a word, she accompanied me up the
stairs to my father's room.

1142
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:29,199
Doctor Meredith, who was sitting by my father's
bed, stood up when I arrived and said:

1143
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,860
'I'm sorry, Stevens.

1144
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,199
He suffered a severe stroke.

1145
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:36,650
I can assure you, however, that he was not
in any pain.'

1146
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,929
'Thank you, sir.'

1147
01:20:38,929 --> 01:20:42,260
'I'll be on my way, now.

1148
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,820
You'll make the arrangements?'

1149
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,630
'Yes, sir.

1150
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:50,030
However, would you mind seeing a gentleman
downstairs?

1151
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,429
He is in need of your attention.'

1152
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:52,939
'Urgent?'

1153
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:57,599
'He is very keen to see you, sir.'

1154
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:03,289
I led Doctor Meredith downstairs, showed him
into the games room, then returned to the

1155
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:12,280
smoking room, where the atmosphere among the
guests had grown even more cheerful than before.

1156
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,889
CHAPTER SEVEN

1157
01:21:14,889 --> 01:21:16,849
Silver

1158
01:21:16,849 --> 01:21:21,489
September 1956

1159
01:21:21,489 --> 01:21:26,570
I am now on the third day of my trip to the
West Country.

1160
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:32,780
Last night I stayed in an inn named The Coach
and Horses, an attractive, quiet-looking cottage

1161
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:36,480
just outside the market town of Taunton in
Somerset.

1162
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:43,469
Unfortunately, however, the inn was not as
quiet as it had seemed when I arrived.

1163
01:21:43,469 --> 01:21:48,579
Although the landlord's wife did not actually
shout, I could hear her talking late into

1164
01:21:48,579 --> 01:21:51,949
the night and, again, early this morning.

1165
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:57,260
As a consequence, I slept rather badly, although
I did not, of course, say anything about this

1166
01:21:57,260 --> 01:22:00,150
when I thanked the landlord and his wife this
morning.

1167
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:07,249
Now, however, I am enjoying a pleasant mid-morning
cup of tea in a small tearoom in the high

1168
01:22:07,249 --> 01:22:11,369
street ofTaunton, very close to the market
square.

1169
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:17,110
Although I am sitting at the back, I can see
clearly out into the sunlit street.

1170
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:21,719
There is an interesting signpost on the pavement
opposite the tearoom.

1171
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:28,119
It is pointing to several local destinations,
one of which is the village of Mursden.

1172
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:34,820
Giffen and Company once had a factory in the
Somerset village of Mursden This company was

1173
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,370
famous for manufacturing polish.

1174
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:43,719
Giffen's polish was the finest silver polish
available for many years.

1175
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:51,010
Then, just before the war, new chemical substances
became available and the demand for Giffen's

1176
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:54,539
silver polish began to decline.

1177
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:57,610
Giffen's silver polish first appeared at the
beginning of the 1920s.

1178
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:04,650
In my opinion, it was responsible for an important
change of attitude in my profession.

1179
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:11,539
The polishing of silver suddenly became a
central part of a butler's responsibilities.

1180
01:23:11,539 --> 01:23:16,469
Before Giffen's existed, the butlers of my
father's age did not consider the polishing

1181
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:18,249
of silver so important.

1182
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:25,269
But in the 1920s, the full significance of
silver was recognized by the younger butlers.

1183
01:23:25,269 --> 01:23:31,489
Visitors to a house would examine the silver
during a meal more closely than anything else.

1184
01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:35,619
Guests would often judge the quality of a
house by its silver.

1185
01:23:35,619 --> 01:23:43,170
I, of course, was very aware of the appearance
of this new, high-quality product, and I immediately

1186
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:46,820
made the polishing of silver my top priority.

1187
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:52,550
I can remember with pride many occasions when
visitors to Darlington Hall commented on the

1188
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:53,550
silver.

1189
01:23:53,550 --> 01:24:00,610
Lady Astor once said our silver shone more
brightly than any silver she had seen.

1190
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:06,530
Mr George Bernard Shaw, the famous writer,
came to dinner one evening and held a silver

1191
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:08,800
dessert spoon up to the light.

1192
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:15,130
But perhaps my proudest moment was when Lord
Halifax, the government minister who later

1193
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:18,729
became head of the Foreign Office, came to
dinner.

1194
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:24,540
This visit was the first of a series of 'unofficial'
meetings arranged by Lord Darlington between

1195
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:30,219
Lord Halifax and the German Ambassador, Herr
Ribbentrop.

1196
01:24:30,219 --> 01:24:35,739
Lord Halifax, on that first night, had been
very suspicious when he arrived at Darlington

1197
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:37,219
Hall.

1198
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:43,019
He was not happy about meeting the German
Ambassador in secret like this.

1199
01:24:43,019 --> 01:24:47,070
Lord Darlington suggested a tour of Darlington
Hall.

1200
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:52,010
In the past, this had often helped many nervous
visitors to relax.

1201
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:57,309
However, Lord Halifax continued to express
his doubts about the evening as he walked

1202
01:24:57,309 --> 01:24:59,619
around the rooms.

1203
01:24:59,619 --> 01:25:04,489
Lord Darlington tried to reassure him, but
without success.

1204
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:10,170
But then, as I was going about my business,
I heard Lord Halifax say:

1205
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:15,780
'My God, Darlington, the silver in this house
is a delight.'

1206
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:20,070
I was, of course, very pleased to hear this
at the time.

1207
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:27,289
Two or three days later I was even more satisfied
when Lord Darlington told me:

1208
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:32,150
'By the way, Stevens, Lord Halifax was very
impressed with the silver the other night.

1209
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:36,300
It put him in a very good mood.'

1210
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:42,229
I honestly believe, therefore, that the high
quality of the silver that evening was probably

1211
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:48,979
responsible for the success of Lord Halifax's
first meeting with Herr Ribbentrop.

1212
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:54,179
I should, perhaps, now say a few words concerning
Herr Ribbentrop.

1213
01:25:54,179 --> 01:26:00,369
Nowadays, of course, most people believe that
Herr Ribbentrop was just a liar.

1214
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:06,010
They say that he was part of Hitler's plan
to deceive the English for as long as possible

1215
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:11,610
- to stop the English from understanding his
true intentions.

1216
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:13,929
I do not wish to disagree with this view.

1217
01:26:13,929 --> 01:26:21,229
It is, however, rather annoying when people
today say that they always knew Herr Ribbentrop

1218
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:23,269
was a liar.

1219
01:26:23,269 --> 01:26:28,070
They say that Lord Darlington was the only
man in England who believed that the German

1220
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,630
Ambassador was an honest gentleman.

1221
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:33,889
The truth is very different.

1222
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:40,820
In the mid-1930s, Herr Ribbentrop was a welcome
guest in the very best houses.

1223
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:46,499
The same people who invited Herr Ribbentrop
to their homes say now that Lord Darlington

1224
01:26:46,499 --> 01:26:48,829
betrayed his country.

1225
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:56,699
In my opinion, anyone who suggests that his
lordship was secretly trying to help the enemy

1226
01:26:56,699 --> 01:27:02,190
is conveniently forgetting the true atmosphere
of those times.

1227
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:07,250
I would also like to correct another false
accusation, which is now often made against

1228
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:09,230
Lord Darlington.

1229
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:15,659
It is nonsense to claim, as people do, that
his lordship disliked Jews.

1230
01:27:15,659 --> 01:27:19,929
People who make these claims know nothing
about the sort of gentleman Lord Darlington

1231
01:27:19,929 --> 01:27:21,689
was.

1232
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:27,469
I heard him express his disgust on several
occasions when somebody made insulting comments

1233
01:27:27,469 --> 01:27:29,639
about Jews.

1234
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:34,670
And the accusation that his lordship never
allowed Jewish people to enter the house or

1235
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:38,550
any Jewish staff to be employed is completely
false.

1236
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:43,530
Except, perhaps, for one minor incident in
the 1930s...

1237
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:49,119
But I am moving away from the subject of silver.

1238
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:53,349
Perhaps I should not spend so much time looking
back to the past.

1239
01:27:53,349 --> 01:27:57,760
After all, I still have before me many more
years of service.

1240
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,429
Mr Farraday is not only a most excellent employer.

1241
01:28:02,429 --> 01:28:07,429
He is an American gentleman, and one has a
special duty to show him all that is best

1242
01:28:07,429 --> 01:28:10,179
about service in England.

1243
01:28:10,179 --> 01:28:15,050
It is essential, then, to keep one's mind
on the present, and not on the achievements

1244
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:16,300
of the past.

1245
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:23,210
It is, unfortunately, true that, over these
last few months, things have not been perfect

1246
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,570
at Darlington Hall.

1247
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:30,679
There have been a number of small errors,
including one incident last April concerning

1248
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:32,389
the silver.

1249
01:28:32,389 --> 01:28:39,110
Fortunately, Mr Farraday had no guests, but
it was nevertheless a moment of genuine embarrassment

1250
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,070
to me.

1251
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:44,809
It occurred at breakfast one morning.

1252
01:28:44,809 --> 01:28:51,479
After sitting at the table, Mr Farraday picked
up a fork, examined it for a brief second,

1253
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:55,050
then turned his attention to the newspaper.

1254
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:59,559
While he was reading, I moved quickly to remove
the fork from the table.

1255
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:05,889
I took it immediately to the kitchen and returned
without delay with another fork.

1256
01:29:05,889 --> 01:29:11,239
I thought for a second about putting the fork
quietly on to the tablecloth without attracting

1257
01:29:11,239 --> 01:29:13,909
Mr Farraday's attention.

1258
01:29:13,909 --> 01:29:18,499
But then I thought it was possible that Mr
Farraday did not want to embarrass me, and

1259
01:29:18,499 --> 01:29:21,650
was only pretending not to have noticed.

1260
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:26,420
I therefore decided to put the new fork down
on the table with a certain emphasis.

1261
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:31,900
This made my employer look up from his newspaper
and say:

1262
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,659
'Ah, Stevens.'

1263
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:40,429
Errors like this have been, as I have already
said, a result of the shortage of staff.

1264
01:29:40,429 --> 01:29:47,739
If Miss Kenton returned to Darlington Hall,
these errors would, I am sure, no longer be

1265
01:29:47,739 --> 01:29:48,739
made.

1266
01:29:48,739 --> 01:29:53,900
Of course, I must not forget that Miss Kenton
says nothing directly in her letter about

1267
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,369
wishing to return.

1268
01:29:57,369 --> 01:30:03,429
Last night, when I was unable to sleep because
of the noise in the small inn outside Taunton,

1269
01:30:03,429 --> 01:30:07,019
I read her letter again carefully.

1270
01:30:07,019 --> 01:30:12,389
It was surprisingly difficult to identify
any passage which clearly indicated her desire

1271
01:30:12,389 --> 01:30:13,829
to return.

1272
01:30:13,829 --> 01:30:19,650
But, on the other hand, it seems foolish to
worry about such things.

1273
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:24,619
Within forty-eight hours I will be face to
face with Miss Kenton.

1274
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:30,939
I shall be able to discover for myself whether
she truly wishes to return to Darlington Hall

1275
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:35,789
or not.

1276
01:30:35,789 --> 01:30:37,260
CHAPTER EIGHT

1277
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:40,639
Sarah and Ruth

1278
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:45,929
I should perhaps, at this point, return to
the question of Lord Darlington's attitude

1279
01:30:45,929 --> 01:30:49,190
towards Jewish people.

1280
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:54,710
I want, in particular, to discuss the false
belief that Lord Darlington banned Jews from

1281
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:58,099
working on the staff at Darlington Hall.

1282
01:30:58,099 --> 01:31:05,119
I am in the perfect position, as head of staff,
to deny these accusations absolutely.

1283
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:10,099
There were many Jewish people on the staff
throughout all my years with his lordship,

1284
01:31:10,099 --> 01:31:13,599
and they were never treated differently as
a result of their race.

1285
01:31:13,599 --> 01:31:20,559
The only possible reason for these ridiculous
accusations is, perhaps, one brief incident

1286
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:24,989
in the summer of 1932.

1287
01:31:24,989 --> 01:31:28,610
1932-33

1288
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:33,809
One afternoon, his lordship called me into
his study.

1289
01:31:33,809 --> 01:31:37,480
'I've been doing a lot of thinking, Stevens,'
he said.

1290
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:44,940
'And I've decided that we cannot have Jews
on the staff here at Darlington Hall.'

1291
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,079
'Sir?'

1292
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,230
'It is for the good of this house, Stevens.

1293
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:53,010
In the interests of the guests we have staying
here.'

1294
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:56,099
'Of course, sir.'

1295
01:31:56,099 --> 01:32:03,699
'Tell me, Stevens, we have a few Jews on the
staff at the moment, don't we?'

1296
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:09,719
'I believe two of the present staff come into
that category, sir.'

1297
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:10,989
'Ah.'

1298
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:14,999
His lordship paused for a moment, staring
out of his window.

1299
01:32:14,999 --> 01:32:19,210
'Of course, you'll have to dismiss them.

1300
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:23,689
It's regrettable, Stevens, but we have no
choice.

1301
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:25,699
I've thought about this very carefully.

1302
01:32:25,699 --> 01:32:28,389
It's in all our best interests.'

1303
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:33,900
The two Jewish members of staff were both
housemaids.

1304
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:39,959
It was right, therefore, to speak to Miss
Kenton first and inform her of the situation.

1305
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:46,650
I decided to do this that same evening when
I met her for cocoa in her room.

1306
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:52,119
I should perhaps say a few words here about
these meetings in her room at the end of the

1307
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:53,769
day.

1308
01:32:53,769 --> 01:32:59,599
Our conversations were completely professional,
although some informal topics were discussed

1309
01:32:59,599 --> 01:33:02,030
from time to time.

1310
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:08,360
Our reason for having these meetings was simple:
our lives were so busy that we hardly had

1311
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:11,999
time to speak to each other during the day.

1312
01:33:11,999 --> 01:33:17,699
This lack of communication was a serious danger
to the continued smooth running of operations

1313
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:20,459
in Darlington Hall.

1314
01:33:20,459 --> 01:33:25,360
Fifteen minutes in private together at the
end of the day in Miss Kenton's room seemed,

1315
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:30,309
therefore, the simplest solution to the problem.

1316
01:33:30,309 --> 01:33:36,290
I was a little anxious about telling Miss
Kenton that I had to dismiss two of her maids.

1317
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:41,849
They had both been perfectly satisfactory
employees, and I was not personally in favour

1318
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:43,310
of dismissing them.

1319
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:50,239
Nevertheless, it would have been irresponsible
of me to display my true feelings on the matter.

1320
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:55,599
It was a difficult task, but it had to be
performed with dignity.

1321
01:33:55,599 --> 01:34:00,650
When I finally introduced the subject towards
the end of our conversation that evening,

1322
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:04,659
I was as clear and as businesslike as possible.

1323
01:34:04,659 --> 01:34:06,479
I finished by saying:

1324
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:12,570
'I will speak to the two maids in my office
tomorrow morning at ten thirty.

1325
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:16,619
I would be grateful, Miss Kenton, if you could
send them to me.'

1326
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:20,949
At first, Miss Kenton said nothing.

1327
01:34:20,949 --> 01:34:22,070
So I continued:

1328
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:25,719
'Well, Miss Kenton, thank you for the cocoa.

1329
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:28,499
It is time for me to go to bed.

1330
01:34:28,499 --> 01:34:31,400
Another busy day tomorrow.'

1331
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,320
As I was leaving, Miss Kenton suddenly said:

1332
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,909
'Mr Stevens, I cannot quite believe my ears.

1333
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:45,340
Ruth and Sarah have been members of my staff
for over six years.

1334
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,999
They have served this house excellently.'

1335
01:34:47,999 --> 01:34:51,119
'I'm sure that is true, Miss Kenton.

1336
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:55,170
However, we must not allow personal feeling
to affect our judgement.'

1337
01:34:55,170 --> 01:35:04,789
'Mr Stevens, I'm shocked that you can sit
there and speak about this so calmly.

1338
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:12,150
You are saying that Ruth and Sarah have to
be dismissed because they are Jewish?'

1339
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:16,869
'Miss Kenton, I have just explained the situation
to you.

1340
01:35:16,869 --> 01:35:21,840
His lordship has made his decision and there
is nothing for you or I to debate.'

1341
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:29,199
'Have you not considered, Mr Stevens, that
it would be quite wrong to dismiss Ruth and

1342
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,969
Sarah because they're Jewish?

1343
01:35:31,969 --> 01:35:36,479
I will not work in a house in which such things
can occur.'

1344
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:40,659
'Miss Kenton, please do not excite yourself.

1345
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:42,070
Remember your position.

1346
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:45,309
This is a very simple matter.

1347
01:35:45,309 --> 01:35:49,619
If his lordship wishes to end their contracts,
there is no more to be said.'

1348
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:56,800
'I'm warning you, Mr Stevens, I will not continue
to work in such a house.

1349
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,789
If my girls are dismissed, I will leave too.'

1350
01:36:00,789 --> 01:36:07,800
'Miss Kenton, may I suggest that you and I
are not in a position to judge what is right

1351
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,809
and what is not.

1352
01:36:09,809 --> 01:36:16,130
The world of today is a very complicated and
dangerous place.

1353
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:21,949
His lordship is in a much better position
than we are to judge what is best.

1354
01:36:21,949 --> 01:36:26,380
Now, Miss Kenton, I really must go to bed.

1355
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,610
I thank you again for the cocoa.

1356
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:35,159
Send the two employees to me at ten thirty
tomorrow morning, please.'

1357
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:40,660
As soon as the two maids stepped into my office
the following morning, I could see that Miss

1358
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:42,969
Kenton had already spoken to them.

1359
01:36:42,969 --> 01:36:45,949
They both came in crying.

1360
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:51,349
I explained the situation to them as briefly
as possible, emphasizing the fact that their

1361
01:36:51,349 --> 01:36:53,809
work had been satisfactory.

1362
01:36:53,809 --> 01:36:59,260
The whole interview lasted perhaps for three
or four minutes, and they were still in tears

1363
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:02,050
when they left.

1364
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:06,829
Miss Kenton was extremely cold towards me
for some time afterwards.

1365
01:37:06,829 --> 01:37:12,139
At times she was quite rude to me, even in
front of the staff.

1366
01:37:12,139 --> 01:37:16,910
Although we continued our habit of meeting
for cocoa in the evening, our conversation

1367
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:20,909
was brief and her tone unfriendly.

1368
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:25,400
When there had been no improvement in her
behaviour after a fortnight, I started to

1369
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,980
become a little impatient.

1370
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:30,360
I therefore said to her one evening:

1371
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:34,809
'Miss Kenton, I am surprised that you haven't
left yet.'

1372
01:37:34,809 --> 01:37:39,829
I accompanied this with a little laugh to
show that I was joking.

1373
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:43,559
Miss Kenton, however, was not amused.

1374
01:37:43,559 --> 01:37:45,360
She frowned at me and said:

1375
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,510
'I still intend to leave, Mr Stevens.

1376
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:52,810
I have been too busy to organize it, that's
all.'

1377
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:57,380
This made me think that she was, perhaps,
serious about her threat.

1378
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:02,350
But then, as the weeks passed, it became clear
that she was not going to leave Darlington

1379
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:03,939
Hall.

1380
01:38:03,939 --> 01:38:10,260
The atmosphere between us gradually improved,
and I began to joke about her threat to resign.

1381
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:16,499
For example, if we were discussing a future
large occasion to be held at the house, I

1382
01:38:16,499 --> 01:38:18,289
sometimes finished the conversation by saying:

1383
01:38:18,289 --> 01:38:23,729
'Of course, Miss Kenton, if you are still
with us.'

1384
01:38:23,729 --> 01:38:29,650
Even months after the event, such remarks
still made Miss Kenton go quiet - although

1385
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:34,400
I think that this was due more to embarrassment
than anger.

1386
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,469
Eventually, of course, we stopped mentioning
the subject.

1387
01:38:38,469 --> 01:38:44,119
But I remember one last reference to it more
than a year after the maids had left.

1388
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:50,479
His lordship mentioned it one afternoon when
I was serving his tea in the drawing room.

1389
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:54,150
'Oh, Stevens,' he said to me.

1390
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:59,510
'I've been meaning to talk to you about that
business last year.

1391
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:01,079
About the Jewish maids.

1392
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:03,230
Do you remember?'

1393
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:04,659
'Indeed, sir.'

1394
01:39:04,659 --> 01:39:10,550
'I suppose there's no way of finding out where
they are now, is there?

1395
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:13,130
It was wrong, what happened.

1396
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:16,520
One would like to compensate them for it somehow.'

1397
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,340
'I will certainly investigate, sir.

1398
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:24,380
But I am not sure that it will be easy to
discover their whereabouts after all this

1399
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:25,380
time.'

1400
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,579
'See what you can do, Stevens.

1401
01:39:28,579 --> 01:39:32,010
That business should never have happened.'

1402
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:37,849
I thought that Miss Kenton would be interested
in what his lordship had said, and I decided

1403
01:39:37,849 --> 01:39:42,550
to mention it to her - even at the risk of
getting her angry again.

1404
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:49,400
However, when I finally spoke to her about
it, my conversation with her produced strange

1405
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,690
results.

1406
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:57,290
One foggy afternoon, I was crossing the lawn
towards the summerhouse in order to clear

1407
01:39:57,290 --> 01:40:00,669
away some cups and saucers.

1408
01:40:00,669 --> 01:40:06,439
As I approached the steps where my father
had once fallen, I noticed a figure moving

1409
01:40:06,439 --> 01:40:09,050
about inside the summerhouse.

1410
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:11,360
It was Miss Kenton.

1411
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:18,030
When I entered, however, she had stopped moving
about and was sitting down on a chair, apparently

1412
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,709
busy with some needlework.

1413
01:40:20,709 --> 01:40:26,719
When I looked more closely, I noticed that
she was repairing a cushion.

1414
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:32,260
As I began to gather up the cups and saucers,
Miss Kenton and I talked to each other about

1415
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,760
unimportant things.

1416
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:39,929
It was a pleasant change to be outside in
the summerhouse after so many continuous days

1417
01:40:39,929 --> 01:40:40,929
in the main building.

1418
01:40:40,929 --> 01:40:46,679
Neither of us was in a hurry to return indoors.

1419
01:40:46,679 --> 01:40:53,239
As the daylight rapidly faded and the fog
began to thicken over the lawn, Miss Kenton

1420
01:40:53,239 --> 01:40:58,519
and I often stopped working and stared out
of the windows in silence.

1421
01:40:58,519 --> 01:41:06,059
Then, during one of our silences, I finally
introduced the topic of the maids' dismissal.

1422
01:41:06,059 --> 01:41:10,599
'I was just thinking earlier, Miss Kenton,'
I said.

1423
01:41:10,599 --> 01:41:17,650
'It is rather funny to remember now, but only
a year ago you were still insisting you were

1424
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:20,030
going to resign.

1425
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:22,860
It rather amused me to think of it.'

1426
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:27,889
I gave a laugh, but behind me Miss Kenton
remained silent.

1427
01:41:27,889 --> 01:41:33,520
When I finally turned to look at her, she
was staring quietly through the windows at

1428
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,130
the fog.

1429
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:43,670
'You probably have no idea, Mr Stevens,' she
said eventually, 'how seriously I thought

1430
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:46,320
of leaving this house.

1431
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:50,869
I felt so strongly about what happened.'

1432
01:41:50,869 --> 01:41:56,400
She paused for a while, and I turned my attention
back to the window.

1433
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:00,630
Then she continued in a tired, dreamy voice:

1434
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:05,409
'I was a coward, Mr Stevens.

1435
01:42:05,409 --> 01:42:09,909
I did not leave because I had nowhere to go.

1436
01:42:09,909 --> 01:42:12,019
I have no family, only my aunt.

1437
01:42:12,019 --> 01:42:20,150
I love her dearly, but I can't live with her
for a day without feeling that my life is

1438
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:22,869
wasting away.

1439
01:42:22,869 --> 01:42:29,919
I told myself, of course, that I would soon
find another job somewhere.

1440
01:42:29,919 --> 01:42:33,619
But I was so frightened, Mr Stevens.

1441
01:42:33,619 --> 01:42:37,670
I feel so ashamed of myself.'

1442
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:43,820
Miss Kenton paused again and seemed to be
deep in thought.

1443
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:49,019
I thought that this was an appropriate moment
for me to inform her of my recent conversation

1444
01:42:49,019 --> 01:42:51,459
with Lord Darlington.

1445
01:42:51,459 --> 01:42:53,219
I finished by saying:

1446
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:56,080
'The past cannot be undone.

1447
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:02,919
But it is, at least, comforting to hear his
lordship say that it was all a terrible mistake.

1448
01:43:02,919 --> 01:43:08,489
I just thought you would like to know, Miss
Kenton, since I recall that you were as upset

1449
01:43:08,489 --> 01:43:11,079
by the incident as I was.'

1450
01:43:11,079 --> 01:43:18,519
'I'm sorry, Mr Stevens,' Miss Kenton said
behind me in an entirely new voice.

1451
01:43:18,519 --> 01:43:21,679
'I don't understand you.'

1452
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:27,449
I turned in surprise and saw that Miss Kenton
was no longer looking dreamily out of the

1453
01:43:27,449 --> 01:43:29,090
window.

1454
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:33,440
She was staring directly at me with a look
of challenge in her eyes.

1455
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:40,340
'As I recall, Mr Stevens, you thought that
it was right and proper for Ruth and Sarah

1456
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:41,909
to leave.

1457
01:43:41,909 --> 01:43:44,730
You were positively cheerful about it.'

1458
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:51,150
'Now really, Miss Kenton, that is quite incorrect
and unfair.

1459
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:54,800
The whole matter upset me terribly.

1460
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,900
It is hardly the sort of thing I like to see
happen in this house.'

1461
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:05,469
'Then why, Mr Stevens, did you not tell me
this at the time?'

1462
01:44:05,469 --> 01:44:11,969
I gave a laugh, but for a moment was rather
lost for an answer.

1463
01:44:11,969 --> 01:44:17,179
Before I could think of one, Miss Kenton put
down her sewing and said:

1464
01:44:17,179 --> 01:44:25,999
'Do you realize, Mr Stevens, how much it would
have meant to me if you had shared your feelings

1465
01:44:25,999 --> 01:44:27,940
with me last year?

1466
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:32,519
You knew how upset I was when my girls were
dismissed.

1467
01:44:32,519 --> 01:44:41,860
Why, Mr Stevens, why, why, why do you always
have to pretend?'

1468
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,639
I gave another laugh.

1469
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:49,809
The conversation was, in my opinion, becoming
rather ridiculous.

1470
01:44:49,809 --> 01:44:52,579
'Really, Miss Kenton,' I said.

1471
01:44:52,579 --> 01:44:55,150
'I'm not sure I know what you mean.'

1472
01:44:55,150 --> 01:45:00,810
'I suffered so much over Ruth and Sarah leaving
us.

1473
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:05,610
And I suffered more because I believed I was
alone.'

1474
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:07,189
'Really, Miss Kenton...'

1475
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:11,320
I picked up the tray of cups and saucers.

1476
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,829
'Naturally, I disapproved of the dismissals.

1477
01:45:14,829 --> 01:45:18,000
I thought that was obvious.'

1478
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,370
She did not say anything and, as I was leaving,
I glanced back towards her.

1479
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:33,139
She was again looking out at the view, but
it had by now grown very dark inside the summerhouse.

1480
01:45:33,139 --> 01:45:39,880
I could only see the dark shape of her figure
against a pale and empty background.

1481
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:56,780
I excused myself and walked out into the fog.

1482
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,260
CHAPTER NINE

1483
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:01,849
Lisa

1484
01:46:01,849 --> 01:46:07,840
One of the replacements for the two dismissed
maids was a young woman called Lisa.

1485
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,989
I remember not being very impressed with her
references.

1486
01:46:11,989 --> 01:46:18,809
Moreover, when Miss Kenton and I interviewed
her, it became clear that she had never remained

1487
01:46:18,809 --> 01:46:21,820
in the same job for longer than a few weeks.

1488
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:28,260
Her whole attitude suggested to me that she
was quite unsuitable for employment at Darlington

1489
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,909
Hall.

1490
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:34,550
To my surprise, however, Miss Kenton was extremely
keen to employ her.

1491
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:40,530
'This girl has a bright future,' she insisted,
despite my protests.

1492
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:44,489
'I will be responsible for her, Mr Stevens.

1493
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:47,849
I will make sure that she does well.'

1494
01:46:47,849 --> 01:46:54,039
I continued my protests, but Miss Kenton eventually
won the argument.

1495
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:58,530
To my amazement, her judgement on the matter
seemed to be correct.

1496
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:03,989
During the following weeks, the young girl
made extremely good progress.

1497
01:47:03,989 --> 01:47:10,610
Her attitude and her manner of walking - which,
during the first days, had been so bad that

1498
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:15,519
I had to look away - improved dramatically.

1499
01:47:15,519 --> 01:47:21,020
As the weeks passed, Miss Kenton took great
delight in her victory.

1500
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:26,320
She enjoyed giving Lisa tasks that required
more and more responsibility.

1501
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:31,550
If I was watching, she would smile at me with
a victorious look in her eyes.

1502
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:38,849
'No doubt, Mr Stevens,' she said to me one
night as we drank our cocoa, 'you will be

1503
01:47:38,849 --> 01:47:46,039
extremely disappointed to hear Lisa has still
not made any serious mistakes.'

1504
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:49,249
'I'm not disappointed at all, Miss Kenton.

1505
01:47:49,249 --> 01:47:53,780
I will admit, you have had some modest success
with the girl.'

1506
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:56,039
'Modest success!

1507
01:47:56,039 --> 01:47:59,210
Look at that smile on your face, Mr Stevens.

1508
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:02,929
It always appears when I mention Lisa.

1509
01:48:02,929 --> 01:48:05,969
That smile tells an interesting story.

1510
01:48:05,969 --> 01:48:09,030
A very interesting story indeed.'

1511
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:12,139
'Really, Miss Kenton?

1512
01:48:12,139 --> 01:48:15,439
And may I ask, what story is that?'

1513
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:23,310
'It is very interesting that you have been
so critical of her from the beginning, because

1514
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:26,119
Lisa is a pretty girl.

1515
01:48:26,119 --> 01:48:31,829
And I've noticed that you dislike having pretty
girls on the staff.'

1516
01:48:31,829 --> 01:48:35,840
'You know perfectly well you are talking nonsense,
Miss Kenton.'

1517
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,999
'Ah, but I've noticed it, Mr Stevens.

1518
01:48:37,999 --> 01:48:48,110
Is it possible that our Mr Stevens feels uncomfortable
with pretty girls?

1519
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:55,880
Perhaps our Mr Stevens is flesh and blood
after all and cannot completely trust himself?'

1520
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,689
'Really, Miss Kenton, you're making no sense.

1521
01:49:00,689 --> 01:49:05,550
I shall simply sit and think of other things
while you go on talking.'

1522
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:12,329
'Ah, but why then is that guilty smile still
on your face, Mr Stevens?'

1523
01:49:12,329 --> 01:49:16,639
'It is not a guilty smile at all, Miss Kenton.

1524
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:21,989
I am slightly amused by your ability to talk
nonsense, that's all.'

1525
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:26,630
'It is a guilty smile, Mr Stevens.

1526
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:31,389
And I've noticed how you can hardly bear to
look at Lisa.

1527
01:49:31,389 --> 01:49:37,480
Now it is becoming very clear why you didn't
want her on the staff.'

1528
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:45,590
'The girl was completely unsuitable when she
first came to us, as you well know.'

1529
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:49,749
Our conversation continued in this way for
several more minutes.

1530
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:54,690
Of course, we would never have talked in this
way in front of the other staff.

1531
01:49:54,690 --> 01:50:02,079
But our cocoa evenings, although still basically
professional in tone, had begun to allow room

1532
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:06,039
for a little harmless talk of this nature.

1533
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:11,170
Playful conversations like this helped us
to relax after the demands of a busy working

1534
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:12,269
day.

1535
01:50:12,269 --> 01:50:20,229
However, eight or nine months after she had
joined us, Lisa disappeared from the house

1536
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:22,380
with a footman.

1537
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:28,989
This kind of thing is, unfortunately, a normal
part of life for any butler of a large house.

1538
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:35,610
It is extremely annoying when it happens,
but one learns to accept it.

1539
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:38,079
They had also both left letters.

1540
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:45,590
The footman, whose name I cannot remember,
left a short note addressed to me.

1541
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:51,150
It said something like, Please do not think
too badly of us.

1542
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:56,020
We are in love and are going to get married.

1543
01:50:56,020 --> 01:51:01,349
Lisa had written a much longer note addressed
to 'the Housekeeper'.

1544
01:51:01,349 --> 01:51:06,459
Miss Kenton brought this note into my office
the morning after their disappearance.

1545
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:11,559
The letter, which was full of spelling and
grammar mistakes, talked about how much in

1546
01:51:11,559 --> 01:51:16,840
love the couple were, and their plans for
a future life together.

1547
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:24,760
One line said: We don't have money but who
cares we have love and who wants anything

1548
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:28,659
else we've got one another.

1549
01:51:28,659 --> 01:51:34,360
Although the letter was three pages long,
Lisa did not once thank Miss Kenton for the

1550
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,869
kindness she had shown her.

1551
01:51:36,869 --> 01:51:40,800
Miss Kenton was clearly upset.

1552
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,510
As I was reading the young woman's letter,
she sat at the table before me, looking at

1553
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:48,459
her hands.

1554
01:51:48,459 --> 01:51:51,760
When I had put the letter down on the table,
she said:

1555
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,099
'So, Mr Stevens.

1556
01:51:54,099 --> 01:51:58,579
It seems you were right and I was wrong.'

1557
01:51:58,579 --> 01:52:04,179
'Miss Kenton, there is no reason for you to
blame yourself.

1558
01:52:04,179 --> 01:52:05,179
These things happen.'

1559
01:52:05,179 --> 01:52:08,699
'I was wrong, Mr Stevens.

1560
01:52:08,699 --> 01:52:10,360
I accept it.'

1561
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:14,840
'Miss Kenton, I cannot agree with you.

1562
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:18,289
You achieved great things with that girl.

1563
01:52:18,289 --> 01:52:22,590
You must not blame yourself for anything.'

1564
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:25,889
Miss Kenton continued to look unhappy.

1565
01:52:25,889 --> 01:52:28,210
She said very quietly:

1566
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:31,849
'You're very kind, Mr Stevens.

1567
01:52:31,849 --> 01:52:35,079
I'm very grateful.'

1568
01:52:35,079 --> 01:52:38,829
Then she said, in a tired voice:

1569
01:52:38,829 --> 01:52:41,749
'She's so foolish.

1570
01:52:41,749 --> 01:52:45,619
She might have had a real career ahead of
her.

1571
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:47,419
She had ability.

1572
01:52:47,419 --> 01:52:55,780
So many young women like her throw away their
chances, and for what?'

1573
01:52:55,780 --> 01:53:01,229
We both looked at the notepaper on the table
between us, then Miss Kenton turned her head

1574
01:53:01,229 --> 01:53:03,130
away with annoyance.

1575
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:05,199
'Indeed,' I said.

1576
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,840
'Such a waste, as you say.'

1577
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,719
'So foolish.

1578
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:14,229
And the girl is sure to be disappointed.

1579
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:19,719
She could have become a housekeeper one day,
but she's thrown it all away.

1580
01:53:19,719 --> 01:53:21,499
All for nothing.'

1581
01:53:21,499 --> 01:53:27,249
'It really is most foolish of her,' I agreed.

1582
01:53:27,249 --> 01:53:32,399
I started to gather up the sheets of paper
in front of me, planning to keep them in my

1583
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:36,199
office, but then I hesitated.

1584
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:41,600
I was not sure whether Miss Kenton had intended
me to keep the letter or not.

1585
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:47,559
I therefore put the pages back down on the
table between us and looked at Miss Kenton.

1586
01:53:47,559 --> 01:53:52,570
But she seemed far away, lost in thought.

1587
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:59,810
'She's sure to be disappointed,' she said
again.

1588
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:04,809
'So foolish.'

1589
01:54:04,809 --> 01:54:05,809
CHAPTER TEN

1590
01:54:05,809 --> 01:54:09,130
A Lonely Hill

1591
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:12,459
September 1956

1592
01:54:12,459 --> 01:54:17,840
I have, it seems, become rather lost in these
old memories.

1593
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,480
This was never my intention.

1594
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:26,139
But thinking about the past has at least helped
me to forget the events of this evening.

1595
01:54:26,139 --> 01:54:33,130
For, I have to admit, these last few hours
have been extremely difficult for me.

1596
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:39,689
I am now staying in an upstairs room of a
small cottage in the tiny village of Moscombe

1597
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:40,969
in Devon.

1598
01:54:40,969 --> 01:54:45,349
It belongs to a retired couple called Mr and
Mrs Taylor.

1599
01:54:45,349 --> 01:54:50,630
It is very kind of the Taylors to allow me
to stay in this room.

1600
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:57,380
Mrs Taylor has not only made the bed for me,
she has tidied and cleaned the room, too.

1601
01:54:57,380 --> 01:55:01,769
Although I have repeatedly offered to pay
for the room, they have refused to accept

1602
01:55:01,769 --> 01:55:04,500
a penny.

1603
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:10,340
I am staying in this cottage because I made
one foolish, annoyingly simple, mistake.

1604
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:14,510
I had forgotten to check the petrol.

1605
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:20,229
It is true, I had been thinking about other
things just before the car stopped.

1606
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:25,889
I had planned to stay in the town of Tavistock,
but I could not find a room anywhere because

1607
01:55:25,889 --> 01:55:29,580
of an agricultural fair.

1608
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:35,610
After I had tried several inns and guest houses,
one landlady suggested that I should drive

1609
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:40,150
to a roadside inn which belonged to a relative
of hers.

1610
01:55:40,150 --> 01:55:45,370
She gave me thorough directions, which had
seemed clear enough at the time, but I was

1611
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:48,550
unable to find this roadside inn.

1612
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:55,099
Instead, after about fifteen minutes, I was
driving along a misty road that curved across

1613
01:55:55,099 --> 01:55:57,800
wild, open land.

1614
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,360
To my left, I could see the last red light
of the sunset.

1615
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:08,110
Through the mist, I could see the distant
shape of an occasional farm building.

1616
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:12,320
Apart from these, there was no sign of civilization.

1617
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:19,019
I turned the Ford round and drove back, trying
to find a road I had passed earlier.

1618
01:56:19,019 --> 01:56:24,290
After some time I managed to find it, but
I was still lost.

1619
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:29,840
This new road was even more isolated than
the one I had just left.

1620
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:37,760
I drove in near-darkness between high hedges,
then the road began to climb steeply.

1621
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:42,159
By now, I had given up hope of finding the
roadside inn.

1622
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:47,789
I decided to drive on until I reached the
next town or village.

1623
01:56:47,789 --> 01:56:53,949
Halfway up the hill, however, the engine made
a strange noise, and I noticed for the first

1624
01:56:53,949 --> 01:56:57,260
time that the petrol tank was empty.

1625
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:03,670
The Ford continued to climb for several more
metres, then stopped.

1626
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:08,510
When I got out of the car, it was almost completely
dark.

1627
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:12,980
I was standing on a steep road bordered by
trees and hedges.

1628
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:18,619
Further up the hill I could see, through a
break in the hedges, the shape of a wooden

1629
01:57:18,619 --> 01:57:21,360
gate against the sky.

1630
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:27,619
I made my way up towards this gate, hoping
to find a farmhouse or something.

1631
01:57:27,619 --> 01:57:33,499
I was disappointed to find, however, that
instead of a farmhouse there was just open

1632
01:57:33,499 --> 01:57:35,570
land.

1633
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:40,369
I stopped at the gate and stared across the
fields.

1634
01:57:40,369 --> 01:57:47,119
The land sloped downwards about twenty metres
from the gate and disappeared into shadow.

1635
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:53,079
About two kilometres further ahead, the land
rose into sight again, and I could see the

1636
01:57:53,079 --> 01:57:55,949
distant shape of a church.

1637
01:57:55,949 --> 01:58:02,110
Around the church there were small clouds
of white smoke rising from chimneys.

1638
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:07,909
I admit that I felt, at that moment, a little
discouraged, but I tried to be positive.

1639
01:58:07,909 --> 01:58:12,780
The situation was not absolutely desperate,
I told myself.

1640
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:17,019
The Ford was not damaged, simply out of fuel.

1641
01:58:17,019 --> 01:58:21,320
It would take me about half an hour to walk
across the fields to the village.

1642
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:28,340
When I was there, I was sure to find accommodation
and a can of petrol from somewhere.

1643
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:34,849
Nevertheless, despite these positive thoughts,
I did not feel happy up there on that lonely

1644
01:58:34,849 --> 01:58:41,960
hill, looking over the gate through the mist
and darkness at the lights of a distant village.

1645
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:47,399
After returning to the Ford to collect my
case and a bicycle lamp, I searched for a

1646
01:58:47,399 --> 01:58:51,130
footpath that might take me to the village.

1647
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:57,159
I was, however, unable to find one, so I had
to climb over the gate and walk across the

1648
01:58:57,159 --> 01:58:59,380
fields.

1649
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:01,780
The journey was not as bad as I had imagined.

1650
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:07,590
It consisted of a series of fields, each one
muddier than the last.

1651
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:13,760
The worst thing was when I tore the shoulder
of my jacket while squeezing through a small

1652
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:17,939
gap in one of the hedges.

1653
01:59:17,939 --> 01:59:22,309
Eventually I discovered a path which led down
into the village.

1654
01:59:22,309 --> 01:59:26,260
On my way along this path I met Mr Taylor.

1655
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:32,090
He touched his cap when he saw me with my
torn clothes, muddy shoes, bicycle lamp and

1656
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:33,380
case.

1657
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:36,670
He then asked if I needed any help.

1658
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:43,369
When I explained my situation to him, Mr Taylor
shook his head thoughtfully and said:

1659
01:59:43,369 --> 01:59:47,480
'I'm afraid there's no inn in our village,
sir.

1660
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:53,690
But if you don't mind something less comfortable,
my wife and I could offer you a room and a

1661
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:55,340
bed for the night.

1662
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,409
It's nothing special.

1663
01:59:57,409 --> 02:00:02,369
It used to be our son's room before he went
to live in Exeter.'

1664
02:00:02,369 --> 02:00:07,929
I protested that I did not wish to cause him
and his wife so much inconvenience, but he

1665
02:00:07,929 --> 02:00:10,269
paid no attention and said:

1666
02:00:10,269 --> 02:00:13,979
'It would be an honour to have you, sir.

1667
02:00:13,979 --> 02:00:18,090
We don't get gentlemen like you passing through
Moscombe very often.

1668
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:26,349
Besides, sir, I don't know what else you could
do at this hour.'

1669
02:00:26,349 --> 02:00:29,189
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1670
02:00:29,189 --> 02:00:32,059
Secrets

1671
02:00:32,059 --> 02:00:38,159
When I said earlier that this evening's events
had been extremely difficult, I was not only

1672
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:42,989
referring to the fact that I had had to walk
for half an hour in complete darkness across

1673
02:00:42,989 --> 02:00:44,550
muddy fields.

1674
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:50,919
In many ways, what occurred during supper
with Mr and Mrs Taylor and their neighbours

1675
02:00:50,919 --> 02:00:53,119
was even worse than that.

1676
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:59,090
After supper, it was a great relief for me
to come up to this room and to be alone with

1677
02:00:59,090 --> 02:01:02,719
my thoughts and my memories.

1678
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:08,100
I have recently been spending more and more
time thinking about the old days at Darlington

1679
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,749
Hall.

1680
02:01:09,749 --> 02:01:15,070
Since I received the letter from Miss Kenton,
I have tried to understand what happened to

1681
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:17,459
our relationship.

1682
02:01:17,459 --> 02:01:22,150
We had developed a fine professional understanding
over many years.

1683
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:30,969
Then, in 1935 or 1936, things started to go
wrong between us.

1684
02:01:30,969 --> 02:01:37,230
By the end of this period, we had even abandoned
our routine cup of cocoa together at the end

1685
02:01:37,230 --> 02:01:38,760
of the day.

1686
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:45,340
But, despite all the time I have spent thinking
about this, I have never been able to decide

1687
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:52,449
the exact moment when things between us began
to change.

1688
02:01:52,449 --> 02:01:56,639
1935-36

1689
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:02,260
One important turning point in our relationship
might have been the evening when Miss Kenton

1690
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:05,260
came uninvited into my office.

1691
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:08,179
I cannot remember now why she came.

1692
02:02:08,179 --> 02:02:12,070
However, I do clearly remember her words:

1693
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:17,849
'Mr Stevens, your room looks even worse at
night than it does in the day.

1694
02:02:17,849 --> 02:02:20,809
That electric bulb isn't bright enough.

1695
02:02:20,809 --> 02:02:23,739
You'll ruin your eyes trying to read by that
light.'

1696
02:02:23,739 --> 02:02:27,619
'It is perfectly comfortable, thank you, Miss
Kenton.'

1697
02:02:27,619 --> 02:02:29,590
'Really, Mr Stevens.

1698
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:33,139
This room looks like a prison cell.'

1699
02:02:33,139 --> 02:02:34,929
I did not reply to this.

1700
02:02:34,929 --> 02:02:40,760
I continued with my reading, waiting for Miss
Kenton to excuse herself and leave.

1701
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:45,169
But a few minutes later I was surprised to
hear her voice again:

1702
02:02:45,169 --> 02:02:50,139
'I wonder what you are reading there, Mr Stevens.'

1703
02:02:50,139 --> 02:02:52,570
'Simply a book, Miss Kenton.'

1704
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:55,269
'But what sort of book?'

1705
02:02:55,269 --> 02:02:59,880
I looked up and saw Miss Kenton walking towards
me.

1706
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:02,619
I shut the book and rose to my feet.

1707
02:03:02,619 --> 02:03:09,300
'Really, Miss Kenton,' I said, holding the
book close to me, 'this is my own private

1708
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:10,300
time.

1709
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:13,530
I must ask you not to disturb me like this.'

1710
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:18,670
'But why are you so shy about your book, Mr
Stevens?

1711
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:21,229
Is it something embarrassing?

1712
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:24,780
A naughty book, perhaps?'

1713
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:30,709
'There are no "naughty" books - as you call
them - on his lordship's shelves.'

1714
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:36,030
'Then you have no reason to be shy, Mr Stevens.

1715
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:39,239
So you can let me see what you are reading.'

1716
02:03:39,239 --> 02:03:43,619
'Miss Kenton, I must ask you to leave me alone.

1717
02:03:43,619 --> 02:03:49,270
I do not have much free time for myself, and
you are disturbing the little free time that

1718
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:50,590
I have.'

1719
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:54,289
But Miss Kenton continued to advance.

1720
02:03:54,289 --> 02:04:00,979
I was tempted for a moment to lock the book
away in my desk, but this seemed over-dramatic.

1721
02:04:00,979 --> 02:04:04,099
I took a few steps back.

1722
02:04:04,099 --> 02:04:07,079
'Please show me the book,' Miss Kenton insisted.

1723
02:04:07,079 --> 02:04:10,239
'Then I promise I will leave you alone to
your reading.'

1724
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:14,380
'The book is not important, Miss Kenton,'
I replied.

1725
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:19,659
'But I do object to this interruption of my
private time.'

1726
02:04:19,659 --> 02:04:22,190
She continued to smile playfully.

1727
02:04:22,190 --> 02:04:29,679
'Perhaps, Mr Stevens, the book is so naughty
that you want to protect me from its shocking

1728
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:31,559
influence?'

1729
02:04:31,559 --> 02:04:37,369
She was now standing in front of me, and my
back was pressed against the wall.

1730
02:04:37,369 --> 02:04:42,079
Then suddenly there was a peculiar change
in the atmosphere.

1731
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:46,710
I am afraid it is not easy to describe what
I mean by this.

1732
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:52,679
I can only say that everything around us suddenly
became very still.

1733
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:59,449
Miss Kenton's playful smile disappeared and
there was a sudden seriousness in her expression.

1734
02:04:59,449 --> 02:05:02,599
She seemed to be almost frightened of something.

1735
02:05:02,599 --> 02:05:04,179
'Please, Mr Stevens.

1736
02:05:04,179 --> 02:05:07,889
Let me see your book.'

1737
02:05:07,889 --> 02:05:13,369
She reached forward and began gently to release
the book from my grip.

1738
02:05:13,369 --> 02:05:16,849
I judged it best to look away while she did
this.

1739
02:05:16,849 --> 02:05:23,300
However, because her face was so close to
mine, I had to twist my head away from her

1740
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:26,479
at a very unnatural angle.

1741
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:32,639
Miss Kenton continued to lift my fingers off
the book - one at a time - until finally I

1742
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:34,590
heard her say:

1743
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:39,989
'Mr Stevens, this book isn't naughty at all.

1744
02:05:39,989 --> 02:05:43,239
It's simply a love story.'

1745
02:05:43,239 --> 02:05:47,459
At these words, I decided that I could stand
no more.

1746
02:05:47,459 --> 02:05:52,639
I cannot remember exactly what I said, but
I remember showing Miss Kenton firmly out

1747
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:55,469
of the office.

1748
02:05:55,469 --> 02:05:59,980
Perhaps I should explain here something about
the book I was reading.

1749
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:06,189
It is true, it was only a love story - one
of many kept in the library and guest bedrooms

1750
02:06:06,189 --> 02:06:08,989
for the entertainment of lady visitors.

1751
02:06:08,989 --> 02:06:15,669
I agree that these love stories are usually
very silly, and I rarely had the time or the

1752
02:06:15,669 --> 02:06:18,829
desire to read any of them from cover to cover.

1753
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:25,939
But I had a simple reason for reading these
books: it was an efficient way of developing

1754
02:06:25,939 --> 02:06:28,949
my command of the English language.

1755
02:06:28,949 --> 02:06:36,269
In my opinion, it is extremely important for
a butler to have a good accent and command

1756
02:06:36,269 --> 02:06:43,519
of language, and I have always considered
it my duty to develop them as much as I could.

1757
02:06:43,519 --> 02:06:48,699
One way of doing this is to read a few pages
of a well-written book whenever one has a

1758
02:06:48,699 --> 02:06:49,939
spare moment.

1759
02:06:49,939 --> 02:06:56,979
Love stories are, in my opinion, especially
suitable for developing one's command of language.

1760
02:06:56,979 --> 02:07:03,099
The characters speak in an elegant way, which
is of great practical value to me.

1761
02:07:03,099 --> 02:07:08,739
A more serious book may improve one's mind,
but would not develop one's ability to hold

1762
02:07:08,739 --> 02:07:13,150
normal conversations with ladies and gentlemen.

1763
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:17,550
But I am moving away from the incident with
Miss Kenton in my office.

1764
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:25,389
It brought to my attention something that
I had not realized before: the fact that things

1765
02:07:25,389 --> 02:07:33,349
between Miss Kenton and myself had gradually
become, over a period of many months, too

1766
02:07:33,349 --> 02:07:34,570
familiar.

1767
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:39,860
After I had shown Miss Kenton from my office,
I decided that we had to return to a more

1768
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:43,610
professional relationship in future.

1769
02:07:43,610 --> 02:07:49,189
This was not, however, the only incident between
Miss Kenton and myself that led to the great

1770
02:07:49,189 --> 02:07:52,010
changes in our relationship.

1771
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:57,869
There were other equally important developments
that might explain what took place later.

1772
02:07:57,869 --> 02:08:03,939
For example, there was the matter of Miss
Kenton's free days.

1773
02:08:03,939 --> 02:08:04,939
***

1774
02:08:04,939 --> 02:08:10,159
Until about a month before the incident with
my book, Miss Kenton's free days had followed

1775
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:12,619
a regular pattern.

1776
02:08:12,619 --> 02:08:18,949
Every six weeks she would take two days off
to visit her aunt in Southampton.

1777
02:08:18,949 --> 02:08:24,189
Apart from this, she would follow my example
of only taking days off if we were going through

1778
02:08:24,189 --> 02:08:27,010
a quiet time.

1779
02:08:27,010 --> 02:08:29,520
But then the pattern changed.

1780
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:35,170
She suddenly began to use all her free time,
and she disappeared regularly from the house

1781
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:37,909
without saying where she was going.

1782
02:08:37,909 --> 02:08:43,709
Of course, she never took more time than she
was allowed, so I felt it was not my business

1783
02:08:43,709 --> 02:08:47,340
to ask her about her little trips.

1784
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:53,360
But I suppose this change in her routine did
worry me a little, for I remember talking

1785
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:56,239
about it to Mr Graham.

1786
02:08:56,239 --> 02:09:01,400
He was a regular visitor to our house because
he was the butler to Sir James Chambers, an

1787
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:04,340
old friend of Lord Darlington's.

1788
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:08,300
I had not intended to talk to Mr Graham about
Miss Kenton.

1789
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:13,189
I had only mentioned that the housekeeper
had been 'a little moody' recently.

1790
02:09:13,189 --> 02:09:19,129
I was therefore rather surprised when Mr Graham
nodded, leaned towards me and said:

1791
02:09:19,129 --> 02:09:23,769
'I'd been wondering how much longer it would
be.'

1792
02:09:23,769 --> 02:09:29,619
When I asked him what he meant, Mr Graham
explained: 'How old is Miss Kenton now?

1793
02:09:29,619 --> 02:09:30,749
Thirty-three?

1794
02:09:30,749 --> 02:09:31,889
Thirty-four?

1795
02:09:31,889 --> 02:09:36,050
She has missed her best mothering years, but
it's not too late yet.'

1796
02:09:36,050 --> 02:09:41,360
'Miss Kenton,' I assured him, 'is a devoted
professional.

1797
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:44,880
I know that she has no wish for a family.'

1798
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:51,210
But Mr Graham smiled and shook his head, saying:
'Never believe a housekeeper who tells you

1799
02:09:51,210 --> 02:09:53,649
she doesn't want a family.

1800
02:09:53,649 --> 02:09:59,320
You and I have known at least a dozen housekeepers
who said they didn't want families, then got

1801
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:02,679
married and left the profession.'

1802
02:10:02,679 --> 02:10:05,989
I could not accept Mr Graham's theory at first.

1803
02:10:05,989 --> 02:10:14,290
Afterwards, however, I must admit that I began
to suspect that Miss Kenton had an admirer.

1804
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:18,389
There were little signs which seemed to support
Mr Graham's theory.

1805
02:10:18,389 --> 02:10:24,479
For instance, I noticed that Miss Kenton had
started to receive letters about once a week.

1806
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:31,849
I also noticed sudden changes in her general
mood which I had not noticed before.

1807
02:10:31,849 --> 02:10:35,760
Sometimes she became extremely cheerful for
no apparent reason.

1808
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:41,519
I do not know why, but this alarmed me more
than the times when she suddenly became silent

1809
02:10:41,519 --> 02:10:43,449
and depressed.

1810
02:10:43,449 --> 02:10:48,619
She was always thoroughly professional, of
course, and I had no reason to complain about

1811
02:10:48,619 --> 02:10:50,619
her work.

1812
02:10:50,619 --> 02:10:56,320
Nevertheless, it was my duty to think about
the future of the house.

1813
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:01,329
I therefore asked her about her plans one
evening while we were drinking our cocoa:

1814
02:11:01,329 --> 02:11:06,169
'Will you be going out again on Thursday,
Miss Kenton?

1815
02:11:06,169 --> 02:11:09,530
On your day off, I mean.'

1816
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:14,769
Instead of being angry at my question, as
I had expected, Miss Kenton actually seemed

1817
02:11:14,769 --> 02:11:18,099
rather pleased to discuss this topic with
me.

1818
02:11:18,099 --> 02:11:26,189
'Oh, Mr Stevens,' she said, 'it's just someone
I once knew when I was at Granchester Lodge.

1819
02:11:26,189 --> 02:11:32,579
In fact, he was the butler there at the time,
but now he's left service altogether and he

1820
02:11:32,579 --> 02:11:35,030
works for a local business.

1821
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:40,019
He somehow found out that I was here and started
writing to me.

1822
02:11:40,019 --> 02:11:45,580
In one of his letters a few weeks ago, he
suggested that we meet occasionally in town.'

1823
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:48,379
'I see, Miss Kenton.

1824
02:11:48,379 --> 02:11:53,119
I'm sure it is a good idea to leave the house
at times.'

1825
02:11:53,119 --> 02:11:57,059
Miss Kenton agreed, and there was a short
silence.

1826
02:11:57,059 --> 02:11:58,619
Then she went on:

1827
02:11:58,619 --> 02:12:05,579
'I remember when he was butler at Granchester
Lodge, he had very ambitious ideas.

1828
02:12:05,579 --> 02:12:10,729
I'm sure he planned, one day, to become butler
of a house like this.

1829
02:12:10,729 --> 02:12:15,449
Oh, but when I think of some of his methods!

1830
02:12:15,449 --> 02:12:19,289
I'm not surprised that he never progressed
in his career.'

1831
02:12:19,289 --> 02:12:21,429
I gave a small laugh.

1832
02:12:21,429 --> 02:12:27,510
'At these higher levels, Miss Kenton, the
profession is not for everybody.

1833
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:34,469
Without certain qualities, a butler will simply
not progress beyond a certain point.'

1834
02:12:34,469 --> 02:12:41,309
Miss Kenton seemed to consider this for a
moment, then said: 'It occurs to me, Mr Stevens,

1835
02:12:41,309 --> 02:12:44,119
that you are a contented man.

1836
02:12:44,119 --> 02:12:47,010
You are at the top of your profession.

1837
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:52,360
I really cannot imagine what more you might
wish for in life.'

1838
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:55,389
I could think of no immediate response to
this.

1839
02:12:55,389 --> 02:13:02,320
There was an awkward silence, during which
Miss Kenton stared down into her cocoa.

1840
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:05,510
In the end, after some consideration, I said:

1841
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:12,479
'I will not be perfectly content, Miss Kenton,
until I have done everything I can to help

1842
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:17,849
his lordship through the great tasks that
he has set himself.

1843
02:13:17,849 --> 02:13:23,099
Only when his lordship's work is complete,
Miss Kenton, will I be able to call myself

1844
02:13:23,099 --> 02:13:26,399
a contented man.'

1845
02:13:26,399 --> 02:13:32,420
She may have been a little puzzled by my words,
or perhaps in some way they displeased her,

1846
02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:35,650
for her mood suddenly seemed to change.

1847
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:42,949
Our conversation rapidly lost its personal
tone and became more formal.

1848
02:13:42,949 --> 02:13:48,159
Not long after this, we stopped having meetings
over cocoa in her room.

1849
02:13:48,159 --> 02:13:55,000
In fact, I can remember our last cocoa together
very clearly.

1850
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,449
I was discussing with her the complicated
plans I had made for a weekend gathering of

1851
02:14:00,449 --> 02:14:02,939
important people from Scotland.

1852
02:14:02,939 --> 02:14:09,219
When I had been talking for a while, I realized
that Miss Kenton was contributing very little

1853
02:14:09,219 --> 02:14:11,499
to our conversation.

1854
02:14:11,499 --> 02:14:15,420
It was obvious that she was thinking about
something else.

1855
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:19,619
I did, from time to time, stop talking in
order to ask her:

1856
02:14:19,619 --> 02:14:23,269
'Do you understand, Miss Kenton?'

1857
02:14:23,269 --> 02:14:30,929
Then her attention would briefly return, before
floating away again a few seconds later.

1858
02:14:30,929 --> 02:14:34,239
After several more minutes of this, I finally
said to her:

1859
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:39,919
'I'm sorry, Miss Kenton, but I can see no
reason to continue our conversation.

1860
02:14:39,919 --> 02:14:43,149
You do not seem to appreciate the importance
of this discussion.'

1861
02:14:43,149 --> 02:14:48,349
'I'm sorry, Mr Stevens,' she said, sitting
up a little.

1862
02:14:48,349 --> 02:14:53,270
'It's just that I'm rather tired this evening.'

1863
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:56,829
'You are increasingly tired now, Miss Kenton.

1864
02:14:56,829 --> 02:15:00,879
You never used to make tiredness your excuse.'

1865
02:15:00,879 --> 02:15:05,899
To my amazement, Miss Kenton responded to
this with sudden anger:

1866
02:15:05,899 --> 02:15:10,030
'Mr Stevens, I have had a very busy week.

1867
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:13,500
I am very, very tired, Mr Stevens.

1868
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:16,669
Can you not understand that?'

1869
02:15:16,669 --> 02:15:19,690
I decided not to enter into an argument with
her.

1870
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:23,550
I paused for a moment before saying quite
calmly:

1871
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:29,669
'If that is how you feel about it, Miss Kenton,
there is no need for us to continue with these

1872
02:15:29,669 --> 02:15:30,919
evening meetings.

1873
02:15:30,919 --> 02:15:35,900
I had no idea how inconvenient they had become
to you.'

1874
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:40,780
'Mr Stevens, I only said that I was tired
tonight.'

1875
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:45,369
'No, no, Miss Kenton, it is perfectly understandable.

1876
02:15:45,369 --> 02:15:50,749
There are many other ways for us to communicate
with each other without having to meet every

1877
02:15:50,749 --> 02:15:51,849
evening.'

1878
02:15:51,849 --> 02:15:56,949
Miss Kenton made more protests, but she could
not change my mind.

1879
02:15:56,949 --> 02:16:02,239
There was no point in continuing our evening
meetings if she was always too tired to say

1880
02:16:02,239 --> 02:16:03,239
anything.

1881
02:16:03,239 --> 02:16:11,179
'May I suggest,' I said finally, 'that in
future we communicate important information

1882
02:16:11,179 --> 02:16:13,999
to each other during the working day.

1883
02:16:13,999 --> 02:16:20,389
If we are unable to find each other, I suggest
that we leave written messages.

1884
02:16:20,389 --> 02:16:26,689
Now, Miss Kenton, I apologize for keeping
you up so long.

1885
02:16:26,689 --> 02:16:31,219
Thank you for the cocoa.'

1886
02:16:31,219 --> 02:16:32,219
CHAPTER TWELVE

1887
02:16:32,219 --> 02:16:37,880
Miss Kenton's Aunt

1888
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:43,529
Over the following weeks, Miss Kenton suggested
several times that we start meeting again

1889
02:16:43,529 --> 02:16:46,929
over cocoa in the evenings.

1890
02:16:46,929 --> 02:16:51,300
I have often wondered whether things would
have happened differently if I had agreed.

1891
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:59,080
It seems clear to me now that my small decision
to stop our evening meetings was, in fact,

1892
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:02,469
another important turning point in our relationship.

1893
02:17:02,469 --> 02:17:09,769
But, I suppose, if one keeps searching one's
past for 'turning points', one will start

1894
02:17:09,769 --> 02:17:11,500
seeing them everywhere.

1895
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:16,729
Perhaps the most important 'turning point'
of all was neither of the two incidents I

1896
02:17:16,729 --> 02:17:19,429
have just described.

1897
02:17:19,429 --> 02:17:23,929
Perhaps it was my meeting with Miss Kenton
in the dining room soon after she had heard

1898
02:17:23,929 --> 02:17:26,059
of her aunt's death.

1899
02:17:26,059 --> 02:17:30,269
News of the death had arrived some hours earlier.

1900
02:17:30,269 --> 02:17:35,250
Indeed, I had handed the letter to Miss Kenton
myself.

1901
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:41,340
I had stepped inside her room for a brief
moment to discuss a professional matter, and

1902
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:45,750
she had opened the letter while we sat at
her table, talking.

1903
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:50,869
She suddenly became very still, but she showed
no emotion as she read the letter through

1904
02:17:50,869 --> 02:17:53,439
at least twice.

1905
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:58,029
Then she put the letter carefully back in
its envelope and looked across the table at

1906
02:17:58,029 --> 02:18:00,090
me.

1907
02:18:00,090 --> 02:18:05,189
'It is from Mrs Johnson, a companion of my
aunt.

1908
02:18:05,189 --> 02:18:08,490
She says my aunt died the day before yesterday.

1909
02:18:08,490 --> 02:18:11,840
The funeral takes place tomorrow.

1910
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,739
I would be grateful if I could have the day
off, Mr Stevens.'

1911
02:18:15,739 --> 02:18:19,420
'I am sure that can be arranged, Miss Kenton.'

1912
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:23,069
'Thank you, Mr Stevens.

1913
02:18:23,069 --> 02:18:27,240
Forgive me, but perhaps I may have a few moments
alone.'

1914
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:31,010
'Of course, Miss Kenton.'

1915
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:37,800
I made my exit but, just after I had left
her room, I realized that I had not offered

1916
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:40,250
her my condolences.

1917
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:46,159
Her aunt had been like a mother to her, and
her death must have come as a terrible shock.

1918
02:18:46,159 --> 02:18:51,670
I paused outside her door in the corridor,
wondering if I should go back and say a few

1919
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:52,670
words.

1920
02:18:52,670 --> 02:18:59,300
But then it occurred to me that she might
prefer to be alone with her private grief.

1921
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:03,670
I hesitated for several minutes outside her
door.

1922
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:10,700
Eventually, however, I decided that it would
be best to express my condolences later, and

1923
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:13,880
I continued on my way.

1924
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:19,649
I thought about Miss Kenton all morning, wondering
how I could help her in her time of grief,

1925
02:19:19,649 --> 02:19:24,070
but I did not see her again until the afternoon.

1926
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:30,040
I was busy with a task in the hall when I
heard her footsteps entering the dining room.

1927
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:32,659
I waited for a couple of minutes, then followed
her in.

1928
02:19:32,659 --> 02:19:37,171
'Ah, Miss Kenton,' I said.

1929
02:19:37,171 --> 02:19:38,269
'How are you this afternoon?'

1930
02:19:38,269 --> 02:19:41,590
'Quite well, thank you, Mr Stevens.'

1931
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:43,939
'Is everything in order?'

1932
02:19:43,939 --> 02:19:45,620
'Yes, thank you.'

1933
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:49,880
'I was wondering about the new members of
staff.

1934
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:52,520
Have you been experiencing any problems with
them?'

1935
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,270
I gave a small laugh.

1936
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:58,689
'There are often problems when so many new
people join the staff at once.'

1937
02:19:58,689 --> 02:20:04,080
'Thank you, Mr Stevens, but the new girls
are very satisfactory.'

1938
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:09,149
'You don't think that there should be any
changes to the present staff plan?'

1939
02:20:09,149 --> 02:20:12,750
'I don't think so, Mr Stevens.

1940
02:20:12,750 --> 02:20:19,270
However, if I change my view on this, I will
let you know immediately.'

1941
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:24,050
She turned her attention back to her work
and, for a moment, I thought about leaving

1942
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:25,689
the dining room.

1943
02:20:25,689 --> 02:20:31,550
In fact, I actually took a few steps towards
the doorway, but then I turned to her again

1944
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:32,569
and said:

1945
02:20:32,569 --> 02:20:34,729
'So, Miss Kenton.

1946
02:20:34,729 --> 02:20:38,020
The new members of staff are making good progress,
you say?'

1947
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:42,060
'They are both doing very well, I assure you.'

1948
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:44,350
'Ah, that is good to hear.'

1949
02:20:44,350 --> 02:20:46,380
I gave another short laugh.

1950
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:51,810
'I was only wondering because neither girl
has previous experience of working in a house

1951
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:53,400
of this size.'

1952
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:56,640
'Indeed, Mr Stevens.'

1953
02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:01,460
I watched her while she worked, waiting to
see if she would say anything more.

1954
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:07,359
When, after several moments, it became clear
that she was not going to speak, I said:

1955
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:12,580
'There is actually something that I would
like to say, Miss Kenton.'

1956
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:18,220
Miss Kenton glanced over her shoulder in my
direction, but continued working.

1957
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:25,710
'I have noticed that there has been a slight
fall in standards recently, Miss Kenton.

1958
02:21:25,710 --> 02:21:28,899
One or two errors have been made.

1959
02:21:28,899 --> 02:21:33,600
I do feel that you need to pay a little more
attention to the new members of staff.'

1960
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:38,090
'Whatever do you mean, Mr Stevens?'

1961
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:44,460
'I myself like to pay extra attention to things
whenever there are new staff members.

1962
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:50,109
I check everything, and see how they behave
with other members of staff.

1963
02:21:50,109 --> 02:21:57,070
I regret to say this, Miss Kenton, but I believe
you have been a little careless in the matter.'

1964
02:21:57,070 --> 02:22:00,239
For a second, Miss Kenton looked confused.

1965
02:22:00,239 --> 02:22:05,960
Then she turned towards me, and a certain
strain was visible in her face.

1966
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:09,760
'I beg your pardon, Mr Stevens?'

1967
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:16,680
'For instance, Miss Kenton, I have noticed
that the dishes are not being put back correctly

1968
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:19,109
on the shelves in the kitchen.'

1969
02:22:19,109 --> 02:22:21,199
'Indeed, Mr Stevens?'

1970
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:23,580
'Yes, Miss Kenton.

1971
02:22:23,580 --> 02:22:28,490
Furthermore, that little corner outside the
breakfast room has not been dusted for some

1972
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:29,680
time.

1973
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:32,540
And there are one or two other small things
I could mention.'

1974
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:36,979
'You have made your point, Mr Stevens.

1975
02:22:36,979 --> 02:22:40,859
I will, as you suggest, check the work of
the new maids.'

1976
02:22:40,859 --> 02:22:46,319
'It is not like you to be so forgetful, Miss
Kenton.'

1977
02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:50,899
Miss Kenton looked away from me with a look
of confusion on her face.

1978
02:22:50,899 --> 02:22:53,990
She looked more tired than upset.

1979
02:22:53,990 --> 02:23:00,250
Then she suddenly turned away from her work,
said, 'Please excuse me, Mr Stevens,' and

1980
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:03,340
left the room.

1981
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:09,140
But it is pointless now to wish that particular
incidents had ended differently.

1982
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:15,490
Naturally, when one looks back on moments
like this, they may indeed seem to be 'turning

1983
02:23:15,490 --> 02:23:17,479
points'.

1984
02:23:17,479 --> 02:23:22,369
But of course, at that time, these things
did not seem so important.

1985
02:23:22,369 --> 02:23:29,690
There seemed to be a never-ending number of
days, months and years ahead - plenty of time

1986
02:23:29,690 --> 02:23:35,500
in which to sort out the small problems that
existed between Miss Kenton and me.

1987
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:41,069
There was nothing at the time to indicate
that small incidents like these would, in

1988
02:23:41,069 --> 02:23:48,810
the end, be responsible for destroying whole
dreams.

1989
02:23:48,810 --> 02:23:49,810
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1990
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:53,500
A Difficult Evening

1991
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:57,810
September 1956

1992
02:23:57,810 --> 02:24:02,010
I see that my memories are becoming more and
more upsetting.

1993
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:05,920
This is probably because of the difficult
evening I have just had.

1994
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:11,200
My present mood is also possibly connected
to the fact that tomorrow - if I can find

1995
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:16,790
some petrol - I shall be arriving in Little
Compton and I shall be seeing Miss Kenton

1996
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:20,729
again for the first time in twenty years.

1997
02:24:20,729 --> 02:24:25,649
Of course, I expect our interview to be polite
and professional in character.

1998
02:24:25,649 --> 02:24:30,729
The most important thing is for me to discover
whether Miss Kenton is interested in returning

1999
02:24:30,729 --> 02:24:33,800
to Darlington Hall or not.

2000
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:40,819
I have to confess that, having re-read her
letter, I am beginning to have doubts.

2001
02:24:40,819 --> 02:24:46,130
Although it seems that her marriage, sadly,
has broken down, and that she is without a

2002
02:24:46,130 --> 02:24:52,550
home, I cannot find any words which state
clearly that she wishes to return.

2003
02:24:52,550 --> 02:24:59,550
But there is something about the way she describes
her memories of the house that is definitely

2004
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:00,550
nostalgic.

2005
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:05,550
It would not surprise me to discover that
she would be happy to come back.

2006
02:25:05,550 --> 02:25:13,279
But again, why am I wasting time imagining
what might or might not happen in the future?

2007
02:25:13,279 --> 02:25:15,700
It will happen soon enough.

2008
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:20,479
And I have moved away from the subject of
this evenings events.

2009
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:25,870
These last few hours, I have to say, have
been very difficult for me.

2010
02:25:25,870 --> 02:25:33,620
I am sure that my kind hosts, Mr and Mrs Taylor,
did not deliberately intend to make me suffer.

2011
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:39,220
But as soon as I had sat down to supper at
their table, a most uncomfortable situation

2012
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:40,689
began to develop.

2013
02:25:40,689 --> 02:25:41,689
***

2014
02:25:41,689 --> 02:25:47,569
A large, rough wooden table dominated the
room downstairs at the front of the cottage.

2015
02:25:47,569 --> 02:25:53,489
On its surface there were many small marks
left over the years by bread-knives and other

2016
02:25:53,489 --> 02:25:55,710
sharp instruments.

2017
02:25:55,710 --> 02:26:00,250
I could see them clearly despite the fact
that the only light in the room came from

2018
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:03,210
an oil lamp on a shelf in one corner.

2019
02:26:03,210 --> 02:26:09,270
'We've been without electricity for almost
two months,' Mr Taylor explained.

2020
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:12,479
'But we don't miss it much.

2021
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:16,890
There are a few houses in the village that
have never had electricity at all.

2022
02:26:16,890 --> 02:26:20,630
Oil gives a warmer light.'

2023
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:25,840
Mrs Taylor served us with a good soup, and
I was looking forward to an hour or so of

2024
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:29,390
pleasant conversation before going to bed.

2025
02:26:29,390 --> 02:26:35,689
However, just as we had finished supper and
Mr Taylor was pouring me a glass of home-made

2026
02:26:35,689 --> 02:26:41,250
beer, we heard footsteps on the stony path
outside.

2027
02:26:41,250 --> 02:26:43,280
'I wonder who that is?'

2028
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:48,189
Mr Taylor said, a tone of mild curiosity in
his voice.

2029
02:26:48,189 --> 02:26:52,640
'It's George Andrews,' a voice came from outside.

2030
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:53,840
'I was just passing.'

2031
02:26:53,840 --> 02:27:00,779
The next moment a well-built, middle-aged
man in farming clothes entered the room, and

2032
02:27:00,779 --> 02:27:04,840
Mr and Mrs Taylor gave him a warm welcome.

2033
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:10,779
With the easy informality of a regular visitor,
he sat down on a small chair by the doorway

2034
02:27:10,779 --> 02:27:13,590
and removed his muddy boots.

2035
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:18,859
Then he came towards the table, stopped and
stood in front of me like a soldier reporting

2036
02:27:18,859 --> 02:27:20,100
to an officer.

2037
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:23,609
'The name's Andrews, sir,' he said.

2038
02:27:23,609 --> 02:27:25,399
'A very good evening to you.

2039
02:27:25,399 --> 02:27:31,279
I'm very sorry to hear about your problem,
but I'm sure you'll be happy spending the

2040
02:27:31,279 --> 02:27:34,130
night here in Moscombe.'

2041
02:27:34,130 --> 02:27:38,310
The fact that Mr Andrews had heard about my
'problem' puzzled me.

2042
02:27:38,310 --> 02:27:44,439
But I replied with a smile that I was very
grateful for the warm treatment I had received.

2043
02:27:44,439 --> 02:27:50,620
I had of course been referring to Mr and Mrs
Taylor's kindness, but Mr Andrews seemed to

2044
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:56,260
think that my expression of thanks included
him because he immediately said:

2045
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:59,250
'Oh no, sir, you're most welcome.

2046
02:27:59,250 --> 02:28:01,899
We're very pleased to have you.

2047
02:28:01,899 --> 02:28:05,640
We don't have gentlemen like you passing this
way very often.

2048
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:09,520
We're all very pleased you could visit us.'

2049
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:15,250
The way he said this seemed to suggest that
the whole village was aware of my 'problem'

2050
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:17,710
and of my arrival at this cottage.

2051
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:21,580
A few minutes later another visitor arrived.

2052
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:27,659
He looked and behaved so much like Mr Andrews
that at first I thought they were brothers.

2053
02:28:27,659 --> 02:28:31,369
But then the newcomer introduced himself to
me as:

2054
02:28:31,369 --> 02:28:32,930
'Morgan, sir.

2055
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:34,490
Trevor Morgan.'

2056
02:28:34,490 --> 02:28:40,819
Mr Morgan expressed regret concerning my 'problem',
and assured me that all would be well in the

2057
02:28:40,819 --> 02:28:41,819
morning.

2058
02:28:41,819 --> 02:28:42,850
He finished by saying:

2059
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:49,609
'It's a privilege to have a gentleman like
yourself here in Moscombe, sir.'

2060
02:28:49,609 --> 02:28:54,890
Before I could think of a reply to this, a
middle-aged couple arrived and were introduced

2061
02:28:54,890 --> 02:28:58,279
to me as Mr and Mrs Harry Smith.

2062
02:28:58,279 --> 02:29:02,790
As they took their places around the table,
Mr Harry Smith said:

2063
02:29:02,790 --> 02:29:10,189
'I believe that beautiful old Ford up there
on Thornley Bush Hill, sir, is your car?'

2064
02:29:10,189 --> 02:29:12,159
I agreed, then added:

2065
02:29:12,159 --> 02:29:16,040
'But I'm surprised to hear you've seen it.'

2066
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:19,310
'I've not seen it myself, sir.

2067
02:29:19,310 --> 02:29:24,949
But Dave Thornton passed it on his tractor
a short time ago as he was coming home.

2068
02:29:24,949 --> 02:29:31,319
He was so surprised to see it there, he actually
stopped and got out.'

2069
02:29:31,319 --> 02:29:35,109
Then Mr Smith turned to the others around
the table.

2070
02:29:35,109 --> 02:29:37,609
'It's an absolute beauty.

2071
02:29:37,609 --> 02:29:40,550
Dave said he'd never seen a car like it.'

2072
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:46,620
'Your health, sir,' somebody said, lifting
a glass of beer, and everybody around the

2073
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:49,330
table drank to my health.

2074
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:50,960
I smiled and said:

2075
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:55,720
'I assure you, the privilege is all mine.'

2076
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:58,560
'You're very kind, sir,' Mrs Smith said.

2077
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:00,159
'You're a real gentleman.

2078
02:30:00,159 --> 02:30:02,229
Not like Mr Lindsay.

2079
02:30:02,229 --> 02:30:06,939
He may have had a lot of money, but he was
no gentleman.'

2080
02:30:06,939 --> 02:30:12,050
There was general agreement with this comment,
and Mr Taylor explained by saying:

2081
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:16,899
'Mr Lindsay used to live in the big house
not far from here, sir.

2082
02:30:16,899 --> 02:30:19,760
He wasn't very popular.'

2083
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,670
Mrs Smith then leaned towards me and said:

2084
02:30:22,670 --> 02:30:26,160
'We told Doctor Carlisle you were here, sir.

2085
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,920
The doctor would be very pleased to meet you.'

2086
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:36,050
'I expect he has patients to see,' Mrs Taylor
added apologetically 'I'm afraid we can't

2087
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:39,750
say for certain when he'll be here.'

2088
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:44,479
Before I could reply, Mr Harry Smith leaned
forward and said:

2089
02:30:44,479 --> 02:30:49,080
'That Mr Lindsay, he had it all wrong, see?

2090
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:52,640
Acting the way he did, thinking he was so
wonderful.

2091
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:54,180
But he soon learnt his lesson.'

2092
02:30:54,180 --> 02:30:58,850
'He was no gentleman,' Mr Taylor agreed.

2093
02:30:58,850 --> 02:31:02,319
'That's right, sir,' Mr Harry Smith said.

2094
02:31:02,319 --> 02:31:08,189
'He had a fine house and good suits, but we
could all tell he was no gentleman.'

2095
02:31:08,189 --> 02:31:11,689
'That's true,' Mr Taylor said.

2096
02:31:11,689 --> 02:31:15,189
'You can always tell a real gentleman.

2097
02:31:15,189 --> 02:31:18,561
You, for example, sir.

2098
02:31:18,561 --> 02:31:23,800
It's not just the style of your clothes, or
your fine way of speaking.

2099
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:27,569
There's something else that shows you're a
gentleman.

2100
02:31:27,569 --> 02:31:33,410
Hard to say exactly what it is, but it's clear
for everyone to see.'

2101
02:31:33,410 --> 02:31:36,270
There were more sounds of agreement around
the table.

2102
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:42,659
Mr Morgan, who had said little since his arrival,
bent forward and said to me:

2103
02:31:42,659 --> 02:31:45,939
'What do you think it is, sir?

2104
02:31:45,939 --> 02:31:51,000
Maybe someone who's got it has a better idea
of what it is.

2105
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:56,850
We're all talking about who's got it and who
hasn't, and we don't know what we're talking

2106
02:31:56,850 --> 02:31:58,699
about.

2107
02:31:58,699 --> 02:32:01,569
Perhaps you could tell us, sir?'

2108
02:32:01,569 --> 02:32:06,270
There was silence around the table and everybody
looked at me.

2109
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:09,020
I gave a small cough and said:

2110
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:15,729
'It is hardly for me to say what qualities
I may or may not possess.

2111
02:32:15,729 --> 02:32:22,369
But in answer to your question, I suspect
that the word you're looking for is dignity.'

2112
02:32:22,369 --> 02:32:29,210
'There's a lot of truth in that, sir,' Mr
Andrews nodded, and a number of voices agreed

2113
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:30,210
with him.

2114
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:32,140
But Harry Smith said:

2115
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:40,250
'Excuse me for not agreeing with you completely,
sir, but in my opinion dignity doesn't just

2116
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:42,220
belong to gentlemen.

2117
02:32:42,220 --> 02:32:47,350
Dignity's something every man and woman in
the country can get, if they try.

2118
02:32:47,350 --> 02:32:54,000
Forgive me, sir, but we like to express our
opinions directly around here.'

2119
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,540
I decided that it would be too complicated
to attempt to argue with him, so I just smiled

2120
02:32:59,540 --> 02:33:00,540
and said:

2121
02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:02,560
'Of course, you're quite correct.'

2122
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:07,460
Mr Harry Smith, however, had not finished.

2123
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:12,920
He leaned even further forward and began to
talk about the war.

2124
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:17,560
In his opinion, everybody who fought Hitler
was a hero.

2125
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:23,580
Every Englishman who risked his life in order
to defend the country had an important part

2126
02:33:23,580 --> 02:33:24,580
to play.

2127
02:33:24,580 --> 02:33:30,119
There should be freedom of speech and dignity
for all Englishmen, rich or poor.

2128
02:33:30,119 --> 02:33:35,410
It didn't matter how poor or uneducated a
person was.

2129
02:33:35,410 --> 02:33:39,920
Everybody's opinion was important, and the
government should pay attention to what people

2130
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:43,000
from villages like Moscornbe wanted to say.

2131
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:49,090
Mr Taylor tried to interrupt, but nothing
could stop Mr Harry Smith.

2132
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:51,680
After several minutes, he finished by saying:

2133
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:55,149
'I'm not talking politics, sir.

2134
02:33:55,149 --> 02:34:00,779
I'm just saying that you can't have dignity
if you're a slave.

2135
02:34:00,779 --> 02:34:02,609
That's why we fought Hitler.

2136
02:34:02,609 --> 02:34:07,740
For the freedom to have dignity, however poor
we might be.'

2137
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:14,040
'This may seem like a small, unimportant place,
sir,' his wife then added.

2138
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:18,770
'But we lost many young men in the war.'

2139
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:21,840
At this, the room went very quiet.

2140
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:26,600
Finally, Mr Taylor broke the silence by saying
to me:

2141
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:30,790
'Harry does a lot of organizing for our local
member of parliament.

2142
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:34,949
He loves telling everybody what's wrong with
the country.'

2143
02:34:34,949 --> 02:34:40,239
'Ah, but I was saying what's right about the
country.'

2144
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:43,430
Mr Harry Smith attempted to start arguing
again.

2145
02:34:43,430 --> 02:34:46,939
But Mr Andrews ignored him and asked me:

2146
02:34:46,939 --> 02:34:51,229
'Have you had any connection with politics
yourself, sir?'

2147
02:34:51,229 --> 02:34:53,439
'Not directly,' I said.

2148
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:56,600
'And certainly not these days.

2149
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:59,470
More before the war, perhaps.'

2150
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:05,720
'It's just that I remember a Mr Stevens who
was a member of parliament a couple of years

2151
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:06,720
ago.

2152
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,060
That wasn't you, was it, sir?'

2153
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:13,540
'Oh no,' I said with a laugh.

2154
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:17,890
I am not at all sure what made me make my
next statement.

2155
02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:22,189
I can only say that it seemed somehow appropriate
to the circumstances.

2156
02:35:22,189 --> 02:35:23,680
For then I said:

2157
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:30,600
'In fact, I was more involved in international
affairs than domestic ones.'

2158
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:36,229
At these words, my listeners looked at me
with a mixture of wonder and respect.

2159
02:35:36,229 --> 02:35:37,380
I added quickly:

2160
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:41,640
'Of course, I was never in government myself.

2161
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:43,570
I was only an unofficial adviser.'

2162
02:35:43,570 --> 02:35:48,720
But they continued to stare at me quietly.

2163
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:51,800
Finally Mrs Taylor broke the silence and said:

2164
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:57,540
'Excuse me, sir, have you ever met Mr Churchill?'

2165
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:00,810
'Mr Churchill?

2166
02:36:00,810 --> 02:36:04,069
He did come to the house on a number of occasions.

2167
02:36:04,069 --> 02:36:10,330
But frankly, Mrs Taylor, while I was involved
in great affairs, Mr Churchill was not as

2168
02:36:10,330 --> 02:36:13,290
important as he later became.

2169
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:18,680
People like Mr Eden and Lord Halifax were
more frequent visitors in those days.'

2170
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:24,000
'But you have actually met Mr Churchill, sir?

2171
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,370
That must have been a great honour.'

2172
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:34,290
'I don't agree with many things Mr Churchill
says,' Mr Harry Smith said, 'but he's a great

2173
02:36:34,290 --> 02:36:35,310
man.

2174
02:36:35,310 --> 02:36:38,550
It must have been an honour to discuss things
with him.'

2175
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:44,270
'It was, as you say, a privilege to be in
such a great man's company,' I said.

2176
02:36:44,270 --> 02:36:48,500
'It is true that I have been very fortunate.

2177
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:55,590
I have met not only Mr Churchill, but also
many other great men from America and Europe.

2178
02:36:55,590 --> 02:37:00,899
I have been very lucky to be able to advise
such important people on the great topics

2179
02:37:00,899 --> 02:37:02,560
of the day.

2180
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:05,080
I do feel most grateful for my good fortune.'

2181
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:11,040
The conversation continued in this way for
some time.

2182
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:16,949
I was asked about the famous people I had
met, and Mr Harry Smith kept repeating how

2183
02:37:16,949 --> 02:37:22,630
important it was for people 'in high places'
to listen to the opinions of ordinary people

2184
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:25,260
like himself.

2185
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:27,029
Suddenly his wife said:

2186
02:37:27,029 --> 02:37:31,010
'I wonder where Doctor Carlisle is.

2187
02:37:31,010 --> 02:37:36,480
I'm sure the gentleman would appreciate some
educated talk now.'

2188
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:37,779
Everybody laughed.

2189
02:37:37,779 --> 02:37:41,180
I decided the time was right for me to go
to bed.

2190
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:47,060
'Although it has been extremely enjoyable
to meet you all,' I said, 'I must confess

2191
02:37:47,060 --> 02:37:49,439
I'm beginning to feel a little tired...'

2192
02:37:49,439 --> 02:37:54,680
'Of course, sir,' Mrs Taylor said, 'you must
be exhausted.

2193
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:58,390
Perhaps I'll fetch another blanket for you.

2194
02:37:58,390 --> 02:38:00,800
It's getting much colder at night now.'

2195
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:05,840
'No, I assure you, Mrs Taylor, I'll be perfectly
comfortable.'

2196
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:10,490
But before I could rise from the table, Mr
Morgan said:

2197
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:12,710
'Ah, there's someone coming.

2198
02:38:12,710 --> 02:38:15,080
I expect that's the doctor.'

2199
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:17,110
'I really must go,' I said.

2200
02:38:17,110 --> 02:38:19,479
'I feel quite exhausted.'

2201
02:38:19,479 --> 02:38:23,020
'But I'm sure this is the doctor now, sir,'
said Mrs Smith.

2202
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:26,180
'Do wait a few more minutes.'

2203
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:31,380
Just as she said this, there was a knock on
the door and a voice said:

2204
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:34,699
'It's only me, Mrs Taylor.'

2205
02:38:34,699 --> 02:38:39,149
Doctor Carlisle was a tall, thin gentleman
of about forty years old.

2206
02:38:39,149 --> 02:38:44,530
No sooner had he said good evening to everybody
than Mrs Taylor said to him:

2207
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:47,160
'This is our gentleman here, Doctor.

2208
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:52,930
His car's stuck up at Thornley Bush and he's
been having to listen to Harry's speeches

2209
02:38:52,930 --> 02:38:55,310
as a result.'

2210
02:38:55,310 --> 02:38:58,399
The doctor came up to the table.

2211
02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:03,090
'Richard Carlisle,' he said with a cheerful
smile as I rose to shake his hand.

2212
02:39:03,090 --> 02:39:05,619
'Bad luck about your car.

2213
02:39:05,619 --> 02:39:07,979
Still, I hope you're being well looked after.'

2214
02:39:07,979 --> 02:39:11,010
'Thank you,' I replied.

2215
02:39:11,010 --> 02:39:13,330
'Everyone has been most kind.'

2216
02:39:13,330 --> 02:39:16,580
'Well, nice to have you with us.'

2217
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:19,720
Doctor Carlisle sat down directly opposite
me.

2218
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:22,380
'Which part of the country are you from?'

2219
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:24,630
'Oxfordshire,' I said.

2220
02:39:24,630 --> 02:39:28,949
Indeed, I found it hard to resist the urge
to add 'sir'.

2221
02:39:28,949 --> 02:39:33,199
'I have an uncle who lives just outside Oxford.

2222
02:39:33,199 --> 02:39:34,920
Fine part of the country.'

2223
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:42,370
'The gentleman was just telling us, Doctor,'
Mrs Smith said, 'that he knows Mr Churchill.'

2224
02:39:42,370 --> 02:39:43,409
'Really?

2225
02:39:43,409 --> 02:39:47,890
I used to know a nephew of his, but we've
lost touch.

2226
02:39:47,890 --> 02:39:50,859
Never had the privilege of meeting the great
man, though.'

2227
02:39:50,859 --> 02:39:54,899
'And not only Mr Churchill,' Mrs Smith went
on.

2228
02:39:54,899 --> 02:39:57,939
'He knows Mr Eden and Lord Halifax.'

2229
02:39:57,939 --> 02:39:58,939
'Really?'

2230
02:39:58,939 --> 02:40:02,840
The doctor's eyes examined me closely.

2231
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:08,180
Before I could make an appropriate remark,
however, Mr Andrews said to the doctor:

2232
02:40:08,180 --> 02:40:13,630
'The gentleman was telling us that before
the war he was involved in foreign affairs.'

2233
02:40:13,630 --> 02:40:15,850
'Indeed?'

2234
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:20,720
The doctor went on studying me for several
seconds, then he regained his cheerful manner

2235
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:22,109
and asked:

2236
02:40:22,109 --> 02:40:24,750
'Touring around for pleasure?'

2237
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:27,500
'Mainly,' I said, and gave a small laugh.

2238
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:31,290
'Plenty of nice country around here.'

2239
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:36,290
Then he turned to talk to Mr Andrews about
something he had borrowed and had not yet

2240
02:40:36,290 --> 02:40:37,640
returned.

2241
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:43,430
For a short time, I was no longer the centre
of attention and I was able to remain silent.

2242
02:40:43,430 --> 02:40:48,199
Then, at an appropriate moment, I rose to
my feet and said:

2243
02:40:48,199 --> 02:40:50,100
'Please excuse me.

2244
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:54,899
It has been a most enjoyable evening, but
I am really very tired.'

2245
02:40:54,899 --> 02:41:00,859
Mrs Smith and a few others tried to persuade
me to stay, while Doctor Carlisle studied

2246
02:41:00,859 --> 02:41:02,270
me closely.

2247
02:41:02,270 --> 02:41:07,699
Eventually, however, I began to make my way
around the table.

2248
02:41:07,699 --> 02:41:14,290
To my embarrassment, everyone in the room,
including Doctor Carlisle, rose to their feet.

2249
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:18,680
I thanked everybody again for their kindness
and good company.

2250
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:23,729
I had almost left the room when the doctor's
voice caused me to stop at the door.

2251
02:41:23,729 --> 02:41:28,670
'Mr Stevens, I have to go to Stanbury first
thing in the morning.

2252
02:41:28,670 --> 02:41:31,899
I'd be happy to give you a lift to your car.

2253
02:41:31,899 --> 02:41:33,850
It will save you the walk.

2254
02:41:33,850 --> 02:41:36,729
And we can pick up a can of petrol on the
way.'

2255
02:41:36,729 --> 02:41:38,890
'That's most kind,' I said.

2256
02:41:38,890 --> 02:41:41,939
'But I don't wish to put you to any trouble.'

2257
02:41:41,939 --> 02:41:43,199
'No trouble at all.

2258
02:41:43,199 --> 02:41:45,060
Seven thirty all right for you?'

2259
02:41:45,060 --> 02:41:48,979
'That would be most helpful, thank you.'

2260
02:41:48,979 --> 02:41:54,460
There was another exchange of goodnights,
and I was at last allowed to withdraw to my

2261
02:41:54,460 --> 02:42:07,640
room.

2262
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:10,090
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2263
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:13,260
Dignity

2264
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:19,250
I feel very uncomfortable about what has just
happened, but I don't know how I could have

2265
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:23,020
prevented the misunderstanding regarding my
identity.

2266
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:29,890
By the time I was aware of what was happening,
things had already gone too far.

2267
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:34,970
I could not have told these people the truth
without much embarrassment.

2268
02:42:34,970 --> 02:42:39,500
On the other hand, I do not see that any real
harm has been done.

2269
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:44,470
I will, after all, be leaving these people
in the morning and will probably never meet

2270
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:46,079
them again.

2271
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:50,069
I ought to stop worrying myself about the
matter.

2272
02:42:50,069 --> 02:42:56,270
However, apart from the unfortunate misunderstanding,
there is something else about this evening

2273
02:42:56,270 --> 02:43:04,490
that deserves some thought: Mr Harry Smith's
comments regarding the nature of 'dignity'.

2274
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:10,450
There is, I suppose, some truth in the idea
that poor people are as capable of dignity

2275
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:12,530
as rich people.

2276
02:43:12,530 --> 02:43:18,530
Perhaps everybody in the land has a duty to
think about the important matters of the day.

2277
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:25,180
But in reality, how can ordinary people be
expected to have 'strong opinions' on everything

2278
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:30,540
- as Mr Harry Smith believes that the villagers
here do?

2279
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:36,090
In my opinion, these expectations are not
only impossible but also undesirable.

2280
02:43:36,090 --> 02:43:44,880
There is, after all, a real limit to how much
ordinary people can learn and know It cannot

2281
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:50,780
be wise, surely, to expect every single person
to be able to contribute 'strong opinions'

2282
02:43:50,780 --> 02:43:54,359
to the great debates of the nation.

2283
02:43:54,359 --> 02:43:59,270
I remember an instance which illustrates the
limitations of Mr Harry Smith's arguments

2284
02:43:59,270 --> 02:44:01,000
rather well.

2285
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:04,979
It occurred before the war, around 1935.

2286
02:44:04,979 --> 02:44:11,609
Very late one night, I was called to the drawing
room, where his lordship had been entertaining

2287
02:44:11,609 --> 02:44:14,520
three gentlemen since dinner.

2288
02:44:14,520 --> 02:44:19,030
I had, of course, been called to the drawing
room many times that evening.

2289
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:25,930
On each occasion, the three gentlemen had
been deep in serious conversation.

2290
02:44:25,930 --> 02:44:30,779
When I entered the drawing room on this last
occasion, however, all the gentlemen stopped

2291
02:44:30,779 --> 02:44:32,640
talking and looked at me.

2292
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:36,020
Then his lordship said:

2293
02:44:36,020 --> 02:44:38,949
'Step this way a moment, will you, Stevens?

2294
02:44:38,949 --> 02:44:43,270
Mr Spencer here wishes to have a word with
you.'

2295
02:44:43,270 --> 02:44:47,780
Mr Spencer looked at me for a moment from
his armchair, then said:

2296
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:52,180
'My good man, I have a question for you.

2297
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:56,520
We need your help on a certain topic that
we've been debating.

2298
02:44:56,520 --> 02:45:03,529
Tell me, do you think our debts to America
are responsible for the present low levels

2299
02:45:03,529 --> 02:45:06,109
of trade?'

2300
02:45:06,109 --> 02:45:12,220
I was naturally a little surprised by this,
but then quickly understood the situation.

2301
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:16,079
The gentleman clearly expected me to be puzzled
by his question.

2302
02:45:16,079 --> 02:45:22,770
It took me a moment or two to realize what
was happening, but in that time I must have

2303
02:45:22,770 --> 02:45:24,620
given the wrong impression.

2304
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:29,550
The gentlemen in the room probably thought
that I was trying to think of an answer to

2305
02:45:29,550 --> 02:45:34,850
the question, for I saw them all exchange
amused smiles.

2306
02:45:34,850 --> 02:45:41,660
'I'm very sorry, sir,' I said, 'but I am unable
to be of assistance on this matter.'

2307
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:48,189
I was by now in control of the situation,
but the gentlemen went on smiling.

2308
02:45:48,189 --> 02:45:49,710
Then Mr Spencer said:

2309
02:45:49,710 --> 02:45:53,320
'Then perhaps you will help us with another
matter.

2310
02:45:53,320 --> 02:46:00,060
Do you think that the economic problems in
Europe would improve if there was a military

2311
02:46:00,060 --> 02:46:03,220
agreement between France and Russia?'

2312
02:46:03,220 --> 02:46:09,979
'I'm very sorry, sir, but I am unable to be
of assistance on this matter either.'

2313
02:46:09,979 --> 02:46:12,680
'Oh dear,' said Mr Spencer.

2314
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:14,979
'So you can't help us.'

2315
02:46:14,979 --> 02:46:19,449
There was more quiet laughter, then his lordship
said:

2316
02:46:19,449 --> 02:46:21,489
'Thank you, Stevens.

2317
02:46:21,489 --> 02:46:23,300
That is all.'

2318
02:46:23,300 --> 02:46:25,680
But Mr Spencer had not finished.

2319
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:27,859
'Please, Darlington,' he said.

2320
02:46:27,859 --> 02:46:32,520
'I have one more question to ask your good
man here.

2321
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:39,479
I very much wanted his advice concerning a
problem that has been bothering us all recently.

2322
02:46:39,479 --> 02:46:42,210
My good fellow, please help us.

2323
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:50,030
What was Monsieur Laval really intending when
he made his recent speech about North Africa?'

2324
02:46:50,030 --> 02:46:55,310
'I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable to assist
in this matter.'

2325
02:46:55,310 --> 02:47:02,579
'You see, gentleman,' Mr Spencer turned to
the others and said, 'our man is unable to

2326
02:47:02,579 --> 02:47:05,939
assist us in these matters.'

2327
02:47:05,939 --> 02:47:08,770
The laughter became louder, and he went on:

2328
02:47:08,770 --> 02:47:16,100
'But we still continue with the ridiculous
belief that our good man here, and a few million

2329
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:21,410
others like him, should decide how to run
the country.

2330
02:47:21,410 --> 02:47:27,390
With a parliamentary system like ours, I'm
not surprised that we never seem able to find

2331
02:47:27,390 --> 02:47:30,439
solutions to any of our problems.

2332
02:47:30,439 --> 02:47:36,329
It would be just as good to ask the mothers'
union to organize a war.'

2333
02:47:36,329 --> 02:47:41,560
There was open laughter at this comment, during
which his lordship said quietly:

2334
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:43,609
'Thank you, Stevens.

2335
02:47:43,609 --> 02:47:45,670
That is all.'

2336
02:47:45,670 --> 02:47:51,000
The following morning his lordship came into
the games room, where I was dusting the paintings,

2337
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
and said:

2338
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,050
'I'm sorry, Stevens.

2339
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:57,199
"We were awful to you last night.'

2340
02:47:57,199 --> 02:48:01,159
'Not at all, sir,' I said from the top of
my stepladder.

2341
02:48:01,159 --> 02:48:03,989
'I was only happy to be of service.'

2342
02:48:03,989 --> 02:48:05,880
'It was terrible.

2343
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:08,819
I think we'd all had too much to drink.

2344
02:48:08,819 --> 02:48:10,939
Please accept my apologies.'

2345
02:48:10,939 --> 02:48:13,850
'Thank you, sir.

2346
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:18,600
But I am happy to assure you I was not offended
at all.'

2347
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:26,590
His lordship walked over to a leather armchair
and sat down with a tired look on his face.

2348
02:48:26,590 --> 02:48:32,199
For a while he stared out of the windows at
the winter sunshine over the hills.

2349
02:48:32,199 --> 02:48:38,290
I looked down from my stepladder and was suddenly
aware of how much his lordship had changed

2350
02:48:38,290 --> 02:48:39,819
in recent years.

2351
02:48:39,819 --> 02:48:44,529
The pressures of life had had a great effect
on him.

2352
02:48:44,529 --> 02:48:50,449
He had become extremely thin, his hair had
gone completely white and there were deep

2353
02:48:50,449 --> 02:48:52,750
lines on his face.

2354
02:48:52,750 --> 02:48:56,659
Suddenly, his lordship spoke.

2355
02:48:56,659 --> 02:49:04,710
'You must understand, Stevens, we're making
terrible mistakes in this country.

2356
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:11,020
If it's any comfort to you, last night you
did contribute to our discussion.

2357
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:17,560
There's too much nonsense nowadays about ordinary
people telling the government what to do.'

2358
02:49:17,560 --> 02:49:19,370
'Indeed, sir.'

2359
02:49:19,370 --> 02:49:27,189
'We're really too slow in this country to
recognize when something's out of date.

2360
02:49:27,189 --> 02:49:31,850
Other great nations have recognized the fact
that change is needed.

2361
02:49:31,850 --> 02:49:35,430
But our country...'

2362
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:41,220
Lord Darlington stared in silence at the view
from the window for a moment, and sadly shook

2363
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:42,930
his head.

2364
02:49:42,930 --> 02:49:48,090
'Our country is always the last to change.

2365
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:56,070
One day soon, we'll need to accept the fact
that democracy is old-fashioned and doesn't

2366
02:49:56,070 --> 02:49:58,369
work in today's complicated world.'

2367
02:49:58,369 --> 02:50:05,500
'The nation does seem to be in a regrettable
condition, sir,' I said.

2368
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:07,770
'Absolutely, Stevens.

2369
02:50:07,770 --> 02:50:10,189
Look at Germany and Italy.

2370
02:50:10,189 --> 02:50:14,040
See what strong leadership can achieve if
they're free to act.

2371
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:17,260
No democratic nonsense there.

2372
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:22,479
If your house is on fire, you don't call the
staff into the drawing room and discuss the

2373
02:50:22,479 --> 02:50:27,210
best method of escape for an hour, do you?'

2374
02:50:27,210 --> 02:50:33,140
As I remember these words, it occurs to me
that many of Lord Darlington's ideas probably

2375
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:38,140
seem rather odd today - perhaps even unattractive.

2376
02:50:38,140 --> 02:50:43,010
But there is surely some truth in what he
said to me that morning in the games room.

2377
02:50:43,010 --> 02:50:49,130
Of course, it is ridiculous to expect a butler
to answer the sort of questions that Mr Spencer

2378
02:50:49,130 --> 02:50:51,170
asked me that night.

2379
02:50:51,170 --> 02:50:56,850
It is clearly nonsense, therefore, for Mr
Harry Smith to say that people can only have

2380
02:50:56,850 --> 02:51:01,779
dignity if their voices are heard in high
places.

2381
02:51:01,779 --> 02:51:08,239
The fact is, the great affairs of the nation
will always be too complicated for people

2382
02:51:08,239 --> 02:51:11,720
like you and me to understand.

2383
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:18,479
Only great gentlemen like Lord Darlington
can decide what is right and what is not right

2384
02:51:18,479 --> 02:51:20,890
for our country.

2385
02:51:20,890 --> 02:51:28,350
It is the duty of the rest of us to serve
these gentlemen to the best of our ability.

2386
02:51:28,350 --> 02:51:35,100
Throughout the years I served him, Lord Darlington
always made all the important decisions.

2387
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:38,390
I was not expected to offer him advice or
judgement.

2388
02:51:38,390 --> 02:51:45,319
It was my duty to be loyal to him, and not
to worry about whether he was right or wrong.

2389
02:51:45,319 --> 02:51:51,020
I was devoted to him and I performed my duties
as well as I was able.

2390
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:57,569
Indeed, many may consider my performance of
my duties to have been 'first class'.

2391
02:51:57,569 --> 02:52:03,949
It is hardly my fault if many people now believe
that his lordship's life and work were a sad

2392
02:52:03,949 --> 02:52:04,949
waste.

2393
02:52:04,949 --> 02:52:11,319
The passage of time may now show that some
of Lord Darlington's efforts were foolish,

2394
02:52:11,319 --> 02:52:15,899
but I have no regrets about my part in things.

2395
02:52:15,899 --> 02:52:21,800
It is illogical for me to feel any shame.

2396
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:24,180
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2397
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:25,270
The Rose Garden Hotel

2398
02:52:25,270 --> 02:52:30,000
1956

2399
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:34,329
I have finally arrived at Little Compton,
in Cornwall.

2400
02:52:34,329 --> 02:52:38,899
I have recently finished lunch and am now
sitting in the dining hall of the Rose Garden

2401
02:52:38,899 --> 02:52:40,060
Hotel.

2402
02:52:40,060 --> 02:52:44,630
Outside, the rain is falling steadily.

2403
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:50,359
I have spent much of the past hour watching
the rain falling on the village square.

2404
02:52:50,359 --> 02:52:55,779
I have considered leaving now to meet Miss
Kenton, but in my letter I informed her that

2405
02:52:55,779 --> 02:52:58,390
I would see her at three o'clock.

2406
02:52:58,390 --> 02:53:03,110
I do not want to surprise her by arriving
too early.

2407
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:08,279
If the rain does not stop, I shall probably
remain here and drink tea until the proper

2408
02:53:08,279 --> 02:53:11,140
time for me to go.

2409
02:53:11,140 --> 02:53:15,790
I am surprised that it is raining, because
the sun was shining brightly this morning

2410
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:17,350
when I got up.

2411
02:53:17,350 --> 02:53:23,729
Mrs Taylor cooked me a fine breakfast of farm
eggs and toast, and Doctor Carlisle called

2412
02:53:23,729 --> 02:53:26,840
for me at seven thirty, as he had promised.

2413
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:33,510
'I found a can of petrol for you,' he announced
as soon as I had said goodbye to the Taylors.

2414
02:53:33,510 --> 02:53:38,770
I thanked him and offered to pay, but he refused
to accept my money.

2415
02:53:38,770 --> 02:53:40,850
'Nonsense,' he said.

2416
02:53:40,850 --> 02:53:43,260
'It's just enough for you to reach the next
village.

2417
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:46,569
They have a proper garage there.'

2418
02:53:46,569 --> 02:53:52,109
I sat in the passenger seat of Doctor Carlisle's
car as he drove out of the village and up

2419
02:53:52,109 --> 02:53:55,949
a narrow road between tall trees.

2420
02:53:55,949 --> 02:54:00,720
After asking me how I had slept at the Taylors,
he said quite suddenly:

2421
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:04,390
'I hope you don't think I'm being rude.

2422
02:54:04,390 --> 02:54:08,450
But you aren't a manservant by any chance,
are you?'

2423
02:54:08,450 --> 02:54:12,640
I must confess, I felt some relief when I
heard this question.

2424
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:14,779
'I am indeed, sir.

2425
02:54:14,779 --> 02:54:17,979
In fact, I am the butler of Darlington Hall,
near Oxford.'

2426
02:54:17,979 --> 02:54:21,060
'I thought so.

2427
02:54:21,060 --> 02:54:26,609
When I heard that you had met Winston Churchill,
I thought that you were either lying or that

2428
02:54:26,609 --> 02:54:28,220
you must be a kind of servant.'

2429
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:32,159
He turned to me with a friendly smile, and
I said:

2430
02:54:32,159 --> 02:54:35,979
'It was not my intention to deceive anyone,
sir.

2431
02:54:35,979 --> 02:54:36,979
However…'

2432
02:54:36,979 --> 02:54:39,430
'Oh, there's no need to explain.

2433
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:41,029
I can see how it happened.

2434
02:54:41,029 --> 02:54:45,689
I mean, the people around here are sure to
think you're at least a lord.'

2435
02:54:45,689 --> 02:54:47,779
The doctor laughed loudly.

2436
02:54:47,779 --> 02:54:53,180
'It's probably good to be mistaken for a lord
from time to time.'

2437
02:54:53,180 --> 02:54:58,470
We travelled in silence for a few moments,
then Doctor Carlisle said to me:

2438
02:54:58,470 --> 02:55:01,729
'Well, I hope you enjoyed your little stay
with us here.'

2439
02:55:01,729 --> 02:55:05,120
'I did very much, thank you, sir.'

2440
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:08,939
'I wish you wouldn't call me "sir" all the
time, Mr Stevens.

2441
02:55:08,939 --> 02:55:12,290
Now this road should be familiar to you.

2442
02:55:12,290 --> 02:55:14,989
Probably looks rather different in the daylight.

2443
02:55:14,989 --> 02:55:17,090
Is that the car there?

2444
02:55:17,090 --> 02:55:19,939
What a handsome vehicle!'

2445
02:55:19,939 --> 02:55:24,010
Doctor Carlisle stopped just behind the Ford,
got out and said again:

2446
02:55:24,010 --> 02:55:25,649
'What a handsome vehicle.'

2447
02:55:25,649 --> 02:55:31,390
Then he quickly produced the can of petrol
and kindly filled the tank of the Ford for

2448
02:55:31,390 --> 02:55:32,390
me.

2449
02:55:32,390 --> 02:55:39,560
When I sat once again in the driving seat
and turned the key, the engine came to life.

2450
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:44,040
I thanked Doctor Carlisle and we said goodbye
to each other.

2451
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:49,189
I followed his car along the twisting hill
road for two or three kilometres, and then

2452
02:55:49,189 --> 02:55:53,640
he turned off towards Stanbury and I was alone
again.

2453
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:57,550
I crossed the border into Cornwall at about
nine o'clock.

2454
02:55:57,550 --> 02:56:03,030
This was three hours before the rain began,
and the clouds were still a brilliant white.

2455
02:56:03,030 --> 02:56:08,250
In fact, the scenery was some of the most
beautiful I had ever seen.

2456
02:56:08,250 --> 02:56:13,550
Unfortunately, I did not pay it the attention
it deserved, because I was thinking for most

2457
02:56:13,550 --> 02:56:16,770
of the time about Miss Kenton.

2458
02:56:16,770 --> 02:56:21,720
Before the end of the day, I kept thinking,
I would be meeting her again for the first

2459
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:25,069
time in twenty years.

2460
02:56:25,069 --> 02:56:30,680
And now, as I sit here in Little Compton,
watching the rain as it splashes on the pavements

2461
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:37,050
of the village square outside, my mind keeps
returning to the past.

2462
02:56:37,050 --> 02:56:42,650
I have been thinking about one thing in particular
all morning.

2463
02:56:42,650 --> 02:56:48,199
I remember standing alone in the corridor
outside Miss Kenton's room.

2464
02:56:48,199 --> 02:56:55,670
I was standing half turned towards her door,
wondering whether or not I should knock.

2465
02:56:55,670 --> 02:57:02,680
For some reason I was sure that behind that
door, just a few metres away from me, Miss

2466
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:05,330
Kenton was crying.

2467
02:57:05,330 --> 02:57:09,590
As I stood there, a very strange feeling rose
inside me.

2468
02:57:09,590 --> 02:57:14,210
I can't remember exactly why I was standing
there.

2469
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:20,100
I suggested earlier that this might have been
just after Miss Kenton received news of her

2470
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:21,460
aunt's death.

2471
02:57:21,460 --> 02:57:29,229
But now, having thought more about it, I believe
I may have been a little confused about this

2472
02:57:29,229 --> 02:57:31,100
matter.

2473
02:57:31,100 --> 02:57:37,859
I think it is more likely that this incident
took place one evening a few months later.

2474
02:57:37,859 --> 02:57:47,510
It was the evening when the young Mr Cardinal
arrived at Darlington Hall rather unexpectedly.

2475
02:57:47,510 --> 02:57:49,329
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

2476
02:57:49,329 --> 02:57:51,819
Events of International Significance

2477
02:57:51,819 --> 02:57:54,960
1936

2478
02:57:54,960 --> 02:58:03,979
Mr Cardinal's father, a close friend and colleague
of his lordship's for many years, had been

2479
02:58:03,979 --> 02:58:08,239
tragically killed in a riding accident three
or four years earlier.

2480
02:58:08,239 --> 02:58:14,989
Meanwhile, young Mr Cardinal had become a
journalist famous for his funny, clever articles

2481
02:58:14,989 --> 02:58:18,270
on international affairs.

2482
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:22,120
Lord Darlington did not like Mr Cardinal's
articles very much.

2483
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:27,359
He often used to look up from his newspaper
and say something like:

2484
02:58:27,359 --> 02:58:29,970
'Young Reggie's writing such nonsense again.

2485
02:58:29,970 --> 02:58:32,489
I'm glad his father's not alive to read this.'

2486
02:58:32,489 --> 02:58:39,489
But Mr Cardinal's articles did not prevent
him from being a frequent visitor at the house.

2487
02:58:39,489 --> 02:58:45,579
Indeed, his lordship treated him like a member
of his own family, although Mr Cardinal still

2488
02:58:45,579 --> 02:58:49,450
always gave prior warning of his visits.

2489
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:54,290
That evening, therefore, I was a little surprised
when I answered the door and saw him standing

2490
02:58:54,290 --> 02:58:55,290
there.

2491
02:58:55,290 --> 02:58:58,829
'Oh, hello, Stevens, how are you?' he said.

2492
02:58:58,829 --> 02:59:01,970
'I was just wondering if I could stay for
the night.

2493
02:59:01,970 --> 02:59:05,970
I've got a bit of a problem, I'm afraid.'

2494
02:59:05,970 --> 02:59:08,489
'It is very nice to see you again, sir.

2495
02:59:08,489 --> 02:59:11,399
I shall tell his lordship you are here.'

2496
02:59:11,399 --> 02:59:17,350
'I had intended to stay at Mr Roland's place,
but there's been a misunderstanding and they've

2497
02:59:17,350 --> 02:59:19,370
gone away somewhere.

2498
02:59:19,370 --> 02:59:21,550
I hope it's not too inconvenient.

2499
02:59:21,550 --> 02:59:26,000
I mean, there aren't any special arrangements
for tonight, are there?'

2500
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:30,560
'I believe, sir, that his lordship is expecting
some gentlemen to call after dinner.'

2501
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:32,569
'Oh, that's bad luck.

2502
02:59:32,569 --> 02:59:36,020
I seem to have chosen a bad night.

2503
02:59:36,020 --> 02:59:37,960
I'd better stay out of the way, I think.

2504
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:40,740
I've got some work to do, anyway.'

2505
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:44,290
'I shall tell his lordship that you are here,
sir.

2506
02:59:44,290 --> 02:59:47,810
You are in good time to join him for dinner.'

2507
02:59:47,810 --> 02:59:52,550
I left Mr Cardinal in the drawing room and
made my way to the study, where his lordship

2508
02:59:52,550 --> 02:59:54,380
was working on some papers.

2509
02:59:54,380 --> 02:59:59,819
When I told him of Mr Cardinal's arrival,
a look of surprised annoyance crossed his

2510
02:59:59,819 --> 03:00:01,189
face.

2511
03:00:01,189 --> 03:00:05,490
Then he leaned back in his chair with a deep
frown.

2512
03:00:05,490 --> 03:00:10,840
'Tell Mr Cardinal I'll be down soon,' he said
finally.

2513
03:00:10,840 --> 03:00:16,739
When I returned downstairs, I discovered Mr
Cardinal walking around the drawing room.

2514
03:00:16,739 --> 03:00:18,819
He seemed rather nervous.

2515
03:00:18,819 --> 03:00:22,939
I gave him his lordship's message and asked
him if he would like some refreshments.

2516
03:00:22,939 --> 03:00:26,109
'Just some tea, thank you, Stevens.

2517
03:00:26,109 --> 03:00:29,110
Who is his lordship expecting tonight?'

2518
03:00:29,110 --> 03:00:30,820
'I'm sorry, sir.

2519
03:00:30,820 --> 03:00:33,359
I'm afraid I'm unable to tell you.'

2520
03:00:33,359 --> 03:00:35,949
'No idea at all?'

2521
03:00:35,949 --> 03:00:38,199
'I'm sorry, sir.'

2522
03:00:38,199 --> 03:00:39,699
'Hmm, interesting.

2523
03:00:39,699 --> 03:00:45,130
Oh well, I'd better stay out of the way.'

2524
03:00:45,130 --> 03:00:48,660
Soon afterwards, I went down to Miss Kenton's
room.

2525
03:00:48,660 --> 03:00:52,900
She was sitting at her table, although there
was nothing in front of her and her hands

2526
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:54,470
were empty.

2527
03:00:54,470 --> 03:01:00,359
Indeed, something about her suggested that
she had been sitting like that for some time.

2528
03:01:00,359 --> 03:01:04,140
'Mr Cardinal is here, Miss Kenton,' I said.

2529
03:01:04,140 --> 03:01:05,970
'He'll require his usual room tonight.'

2530
03:01:05,970 --> 03:01:09,420
'Very well, Mr Stevens.

2531
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:12,779
I shall prepare it before I leave.'

2532
03:01:12,779 --> 03:01:16,140
'Ah, you are going out this evening, Miss
Kenton?'

2533
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:20,300
'I am indeed, Mr Stevens.'

2534
03:01:20,300 --> 03:01:23,689
Perhaps I looked a little surprised, for she
went on:

2535
03:01:23,689 --> 03:01:29,069
'You will recall, Mr Stevens, that we discussed
this a fortnight ago.'

2536
03:01:29,069 --> 03:01:31,460
'Yes, of course, Miss Kenton.

2537
03:01:31,460 --> 03:01:32,460
I beg your pardon.

2538
03:01:32,460 --> 03:01:34,300
I had forgotten.'

2539
03:01:34,300 --> 03:01:37,290
'Is something the matter, Mr Stevens?'

2540
03:01:37,290 --> 03:01:39,970
'Not at all, Miss Kenton.

2541
03:01:39,970 --> 03:01:43,989
Some visitors are expected this evening, but
your presence will not be required.'

2542
03:01:43,989 --> 03:01:49,729
'We agreed a fortnight ago, Mr Stevens, that
I could have this evening off.'

2543
03:01:49,729 --> 03:01:51,279
'Of course, Miss Kenton.

2544
03:01:51,279 --> 03:01:53,710
I do beg your pardon.'

2545
03:01:53,710 --> 03:01:58,930
I turned to leave, but then I was stopped
at the door by Miss Kenton saying:

2546
03:01:58,930 --> 03:02:02,619
'Mr Stevens, I have something to tell you.'

2547
03:02:02,619 --> 03:02:04,600
'Yes, Miss Kenton?'

2548
03:02:04,600 --> 03:02:09,189
'It is about my friend, whom I am going to
meet tonight.'

2549
03:02:09,189 --> 03:02:11,149
'Yes, Miss Kenton.'

2550
03:02:11,149 --> 03:02:14,050
'He has asked me to marry him.

2551
03:02:14,050 --> 03:02:16,250
I thought I ought to tell you.'

2552
03:02:16,250 --> 03:02:18,640
'Indeed, Miss Kenton.

2553
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:20,529
That is very interesting.'

2554
03:02:20,529 --> 03:02:23,530
'I have not made up my mind yet.

2555
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:26,739
He starts a new job in the West Country next
month.

2556
03:02:26,739 --> 03:02:29,939
As I say, I haven't decided yet.

2557
03:02:29,939 --> 03:02:33,810
But I thought you should be informed of the
situation.'

2558
03:02:33,810 --> 03:02:36,239
'I'm very grateful, Miss Kenton.

2559
03:02:36,239 --> 03:02:38,960
I do hope you have a pleasant evening.

2560
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:42,680
Now please excuse me.'

2561
03:02:42,680 --> 03:02:46,869
I met Miss Kenton again about twenty minutes
later.

2562
03:02:46,869 --> 03:02:51,880
I was halfway up the back stairs carrying
a heavy tray when I heard the sound of angry

2563
03:02:51,880 --> 03:02:54,160
footsteps on the floor below me.

2564
03:02:54,160 --> 03:02:59,380
Turning, I saw Miss Kenton staring up at me
from the foot of the stairs.

2565
03:02:59,380 --> 03:03:06,510
'Mr Stevens, do I understand that you wish
me to remain on duty this evening?'

2566
03:03:06,510 --> 03:03:09,180
'Not at all, Miss Kenton.

2567
03:03:09,180 --> 03:03:13,800
As you explained, you did inform me of your
intentions some time ago.'

2568
03:03:13,800 --> 03:03:18,160
'But I can see you are very unhappy about
my absence tonight.'

2569
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:21,470
'Not at all, Miss Kenton.'

2570
03:03:21,470 --> 03:03:25,130
'Then why are you making so much noise in
the kitchen?

2571
03:03:25,130 --> 03:03:29,930
And why do you keep marching up and down the
corridor outside my room?

2572
03:03:29,930 --> 03:03:33,240
Were you hoping to make me change my mind?'

2573
03:03:33,240 --> 03:03:39,050
'Miss Kenton, the slight excitement in the
kitchen is only because Mr Cardinal has come

2574
03:03:39,050 --> 03:03:40,529
to dinner.

2575
03:03:40,529 --> 03:03:44,420
There is absolutely no reason why you should
not go out this evening.'

2576
03:03:44,420 --> 03:03:47,449
'I intend to go out, Mr Stevens.

2577
03:03:47,449 --> 03:03:49,271
I wish to make this clear.

2578
03:03:49,271 --> 03:03:51,989
I made arrangements weeks ago.'

2579
03:03:51,989 --> 03:03:53,979
'Indeed, Miss Kenton.

2580
03:03:53,979 --> 03:03:59,510
And once again, I wish you a very pleasant
evening.'

2581
03:03:59,510 --> 03:04:02,960
There was an odd atmosphere at dinner that
evening between the two gentlemen.

2582
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:06,659
For long moments, they ate in silence.

2583
03:04:06,659 --> 03:04:10,550
During one of these silences, Mr Cardinal
said:

2584
03:04:10,550 --> 03:04:13,859
'Something special tonight, sir?'

2585
03:04:13,859 --> 03:04:14,859
'Eh?'

2586
03:04:14,859 --> 03:04:17,270
'Your visitors this evening.

2587
03:04:17,270 --> 03:04:18,369
Special?'

2588
03:04:18,369 --> 03:04:20,720
'I'm afraid I can't tell you, my boy.'

2589
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:21,920
'Oh dear.

2590
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:25,100
I suppose this means I can't join you.'

2591
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:27,979
'Join me in what?'

2592
03:04:27,979 --> 03:04:29,979
'Whatever's taking place tonight.'

2593
03:04:29,979 --> 03:04:32,479
'Oh, it wouldn't interest you.

2594
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:34,540
Besides, it's private.

2595
03:04:34,540 --> 03:04:35,540
And you're a journalist.'

2596
03:04:35,540 --> 03:04:40,990
After dinner, the gentlemen went into the
smoking room.

2597
03:04:40,990 --> 03:04:46,659
However, in contrast to their quiet mood at
dinner, they soon began to exchange angry

2598
03:04:46,659 --> 03:04:48,909
words with each other.

2599
03:04:48,909 --> 03:04:54,619
Of course, I did not stop to listen, but I
could not avoid hearing his lordship shouting:

2600
03:04:54,619 --> 03:04:57,609
'But that's not your business, my boy!

2601
03:04:57,609 --> 03:05:00,649
Not your business!'

2602
03:05:00,649 --> 03:05:04,590
I was in the dining room when the two gentlemen
eventually came out.

2603
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:06,649
They seemed calmer.

2604
03:05:06,649 --> 03:05:10,939
As they crossed the hall, his lordship turned
to Mr Cardinal and said:

2605
03:05:10,939 --> 03:05:15,380
'Now remember, my boy I'm trusting you.'

2606
03:05:15,380 --> 03:05:19,670
'Yes, yes,' Mr Cardinal said with some annoyance.

2607
03:05:19,670 --> 03:05:21,229
'I promise.'

2608
03:05:21,229 --> 03:05:26,720
At eight thirty, I heard the sound of motors
outside.

2609
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:29,779
I opened the door to a policeman.

2610
03:05:29,779 --> 03:05:36,380
Over his shoulder I could see that other policemen
with guns were moving off in different directions.

2611
03:05:36,380 --> 03:05:41,550
The next moment, I was showing two very important
gentlemen into the hall, where they were met

2612
03:05:41,550 --> 03:05:43,130
by his lordship.

2613
03:05:43,130 --> 03:05:47,409
He quickly took them into the drawing room.

2614
03:05:47,409 --> 03:05:52,479
Ten minutes later there was the sound of another
car and I opened the door to Herr Ribbentrop,

2615
03:05:52,479 --> 03:05:53,819
the German Ambassador.

2616
03:05:53,819 --> 03:05:58,479
He, too, disappeared quickly into the drawing
room.

2617
03:05:58,479 --> 03:06:03,909
A few minutes later, when I was called in
to provide refreshments, the four gentlemen

2618
03:06:03,909 --> 03:06:06,510
were discussing sausages.

2619
03:06:06,510 --> 03:06:11,250
The atmosphere seemed, on the surface, quite
friendly.

2620
03:06:11,250 --> 03:06:15,840
After serving the four gentlemen with drinks,
I went to my position near the entrance in

2621
03:06:15,840 --> 03:06:17,880
the hall.

2622
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:22,779
I had been standing there for two hours when
the back doorbell was rung.

2623
03:06:22,779 --> 03:06:28,270
When I went down, I discovered a policeman
standing there with Miss Kenton.

2624
03:06:28,270 --> 03:06:31,790
He asked me to confirm her identity.

2625
03:06:31,790 --> 03:06:36,949
Minutes later, as I was shutting the door,
I noticed Miss Kenton waiting for me, and

2626
03:06:36,949 --> 03:06:37,949
said:

2627
03:06:37,949 --> 03:06:42,010
'I hope you had a pleasant evening, Miss Kenton.'

2628
03:06:42,010 --> 03:06:47,159
She made no reply, so I repeated my comment
as we were crossing the floor of the unlit

2629
03:06:47,159 --> 03:06:48,159
kitchen.

2630
03:06:48,159 --> 03:06:52,430
'I did, thank you, Mr Stevens,' she said at
last.

2631
03:06:52,430 --> 03:06:55,579
'I'm pleased to hear that.'

2632
03:06:55,579 --> 03:07:01,189
Behind me, Miss Kenton's footsteps suddenly
stopped, and I heard her say:

2633
03:07:01,189 --> 03:07:07,840
'Are you not at all interested in what took
place between my friend and me, Mr Stevens?'

2634
03:07:07,840 --> 03:07:14,649
'I do not mean to be rude, Miss Kenton, but
I really must return upstairs immediately.

2635
03:07:14,649 --> 03:07:18,540
Events of international significance are taking
place in this house.'

2636
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:21,300
'Very well, Mr Stevens.

2637
03:07:21,300 --> 03:07:25,159
As you are in such a hurry, I shall be brief.

2638
03:07:25,159 --> 03:07:27,880
I have accepted my friend's proposal of marriage.'

2639
03:07:27,880 --> 03:07:31,370
'Really, Miss Kenton?

2640
03:07:31,370 --> 03:07:34,119
Then may I offer you my congratulations.'

2641
03:07:34,119 --> 03:07:37,199
'Thank you, Mr Stevens.

2642
03:07:37,199 --> 03:07:42,989
Of course, I will not break my contract, but
I would be very grateful if you could release

2643
03:07:42,989 --> 03:07:44,610
me earlier.

2644
03:07:44,610 --> 03:07:48,979
My friend begins his new job in the West Country
in two weeks' time.'

2645
03:07:48,979 --> 03:07:54,550
'I will do my best to find a replacement at
the earliest opportunity, Miss Kenton,' I

2646
03:07:54,550 --> 03:07:55,550
said.

2647
03:07:55,550 --> 03:07:56,710
'Now please excuse me.

2648
03:07:56,710 --> 03:08:00,199
I must return upstairs.'

2649
03:08:00,199 --> 03:08:06,060
I started to walk away again but, just as
I had reached the door, I heard Miss Kenton's

2650
03:08:06,060 --> 03:08:07,069
voice.

2651
03:08:07,069 --> 03:08:15,399
'Mr Stevens,' she said, her voice echoing
strangely in the dark and empty kitchen.

2652
03:08:15,399 --> 03:08:22,750
'After the many years of service I have given
in this house, is that all you have to say?'

2653
03:08:22,750 --> 03:08:27,100
'Miss Kenton, you have my warmest congratulations.

2654
03:08:27,100 --> 03:08:33,770
But I repeat, there are matters of international
importance taking place upstairs, and I must

2655
03:08:33,770 --> 03:08:35,270
return immediately.'

2656
03:08:35,270 --> 03:08:42,540
'Did you know, Mr Stevens, that you have been
a very important figure for my friend and

2657
03:08:42,540 --> 03:08:43,550
me?'

2658
03:08:43,550 --> 03:08:45,700
'Really, Miss Kenton?'

2659
03:08:45,700 --> 03:08:47,609
'Yes, Mr Stevens.

2660
03:08:47,609 --> 03:08:51,970
We often amuse ourselves with little stories
about you.'

2661
03:08:51,970 --> 03:08:53,740
'Indeed, Miss Kenton.

2662
03:08:53,740 --> 03:08:56,529
Now please excuse me.'

2663
03:08:56,529 --> 03:09:01,399
I went up to the hall and returned to my position
by the main door.

2664
03:09:01,399 --> 03:09:08,020
However, five minutes later, Mr Cardinal appeared
in the doorway of the library and signalled

2665
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:09,359
for me to come over.

2666
03:09:09,359 --> 03:09:12,680
'Hate to bother you, Stevens,' he said.

2667
03:09:12,680 --> 03:09:15,780
'But could you possibly fetch me a little
more whisky?

2668
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:18,939
The bottle you brought in earlier seems to
be finished.'

2669
03:09:18,939 --> 03:09:23,500
'You are very welcome to whatever refreshments
you desire, sir.

2670
03:09:23,500 --> 03:09:29,439
However, as you have some work to do, I wonder
whether another bottle is a good idea?'

2671
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:32,239
'My work will be fine, Stevens.

2672
03:09:32,239 --> 03:09:35,319
So be a good fellow and get me another bottle.'

2673
03:09:35,319 --> 03:09:39,069
'Very well, sir.'

2674
03:09:39,069 --> 03:09:44,470
When I returned to the library a moment later,
Mr Cardinal was wandering around, reading

2675
03:09:44,470 --> 03:09:47,600
the names of books on the shelves.

2676
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:52,880
As I approached, he sat down heavily into
a leather armchair.

2677
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:57,010
I went over to him, poured a little whisky
and gave him the glass.

2678
03:09:57,010 --> 03:10:02,869
'You know, Stevens, we've been friends for
some time, haven't we?'

2679
03:10:02,869 --> 03:10:03,869
'Indeed, sir.'

2680
03:10:03,869 --> 03:10:09,020
'I always look forward to a little chat with
you whenever I come here.

2681
03:10:09,020 --> 03:10:12,140
Would you like to join me in a little drink?'

2682
03:10:12,140 --> 03:10:17,070
I politely refused his kind invitation, but
Mr Cardinal insisted.

2683
03:10:17,070 --> 03:10:20,020
'I do wish you'd sit down, Stevens.

2684
03:10:20,020 --> 03:10:23,550
I want us to talk as friends.'

2685
03:10:23,550 --> 03:10:24,899
'I'm sorry, sir.'

2686
03:10:24,899 --> 03:10:31,789
I put down my tray and sat down - in an appropriate
fashion - in the armchair that Mr Cardinal

2687
03:10:31,789 --> 03:10:33,290
was indicating.

2688
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:36,899
'That's better,' Mr Cardinal said.

2689
03:10:36,899 --> 03:10:41,920
'Now, Stevens, I really ought to be truthful
with you.

2690
03:10:41,920 --> 03:10:48,100
As you have probably guessed, I didn't come
here tonight by accident.

2691
03:10:48,100 --> 03:10:50,779
Somebody told me about what's going on here.

2692
03:10:50,779 --> 03:10:55,510
I don't suppose you can tell me whether the
Prime Minister's here, can you?'

2693
03:10:55,510 --> 03:10:57,780
'The Prime Minister, sir?'

2694
03:10:57,780 --> 03:11:01,280
'Oh, it's all right, you don't have to tell
me.

2695
03:11:01,280 --> 03:11:03,869
I understand you're in a difficult position.'

2696
03:11:03,869 --> 03:11:09,729
He looked away tiredly for a moment towards
his papers, which were scattered over the

2697
03:11:09,729 --> 03:11:11,729
desk.

2698
03:11:11,729 --> 03:11:13,829
Then he turned to me again and said:

2699
03:11:13,829 --> 03:11:19,909
'You know, Stevens, his lordship's been like
a second father to me.

2700
03:11:19,909 --> 03:11:21,770
I care for him very deeply.

2701
03:11:21,770 --> 03:11:24,939
But we must face facts.

2702
03:11:24,939 --> 03:11:29,390
He's in trouble, and I'm extremely worried
about him.

2703
03:11:29,390 --> 03:11:34,949
He's dealing with very powerful people here,
and he doesn't really understand what's going

2704
03:11:34,949 --> 03:11:35,949
on.'

2705
03:11:35,949 --> 03:11:37,750
'Really, sir?'

2706
03:11:37,750 --> 03:11:43,029
'Stevens, do you know what's happening at
this exact moment in that room across the

2707
03:11:43,029 --> 03:11:44,689
hall?

2708
03:11:44,689 --> 03:11:48,830
There are four men in that room - I don't
need you to confirm it.

2709
03:11:48,830 --> 03:11:54,700
His lordship, the British Prime Minister,
the head of the Foreign Office and the German

2710
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:56,869
Ambassador.

2711
03:11:56,869 --> 03:12:02,149
His lordship has worked hard for this meeting,
and he genuinely believes he's doing something

2712
03:12:02,149 --> 03:12:04,420
good and honourable.

2713
03:12:04,420 --> 03:12:09,310
Do you know why his lordship has brought these
gentlemen here tonight?'

2714
03:12:09,310 --> 03:12:10,930
'I'm afraid not, sir.'

2715
03:12:10,930 --> 03:12:14,989
'Tell me, Stevens, don't you care at all?

2716
03:12:14,989 --> 03:12:16,660
Aren't you curious?'

2717
03:12:16,660 --> 03:12:21,119
'I do not believe that I am not curious, sir.

2718
03:12:21,119 --> 03:12:26,569
However, it is not my job to display curiosity
about such matters.'

2719
03:12:26,569 --> 03:12:29,539
'I suppose you think that's being loyal?

2720
03:12:29,539 --> 03:12:31,359
To his lordship?

2721
03:12:31,359 --> 03:12:33,500
Or to the King?'

2722
03:12:33,500 --> 03:12:34,579
'I'm sorry, sir.

2723
03:12:34,579 --> 03:12:38,500
I fail to understand what you are proposing.'

2724
03:12:38,500 --> 03:12:41,289
Mr Cardinal shook his head sadly.

2725
03:12:41,289 --> 03:12:44,220
'I'm not proposing anything, Stevens.

2726
03:12:44,220 --> 03:12:48,300
Quite frankly, I don't know what we can do.

2727
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:52,369
But I wish you would be more curious.'

2728
03:12:52,369 --> 03:12:57,920
He was silent for a moment and seemed to be
staring emptily at the area of carpet around

2729
03:12:57,920 --> 03:13:00,150
my feet.

2730
03:13:00,150 --> 03:13:02,110
Finally he looked up and said:

2731
03:13:02,110 --> 03:13:06,130
'Are you sure you won't join me in a drink,
Stevens?'

2732
03:13:06,130 --> 03:13:08,439
'No thank you, sir.'

2733
03:13:08,439 --> 03:13:14,510
'The fact is, Stevens, his lordship doesn't
realize what's happening.

2734
03:13:14,510 --> 03:13:17,109
He's become Herr Hitler's puppet.

2735
03:13:17,109 --> 03:13:22,989
Have you noticed what's been happening over
the last three or four years?'

2736
03:13:22,989 --> 03:13:25,880
'I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid I have not.'

2737
03:13:25,880 --> 03:13:27,890
'Of course not, Stevens.

2738
03:13:27,890 --> 03:13:29,289
You're not curious.

2739
03:13:29,289 --> 03:13:35,310
The problem is, Stevens,' Mr Cardinal said,
moving into a more upright position in his

2740
03:13:35,310 --> 03:13:41,710
armchair, 'his lordship is a true, old English
gentleman.

2741
03:13:41,710 --> 03:13:47,180
He feels it is honourable to offer generosity
and friendship to a defeated enemy.

2742
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:54,279
But they're using him, Stevens - the Nazis
are using him to help them achieve their own

2743
03:13:54,279 --> 03:13:55,510
terrible aims.

2744
03:13:55,510 --> 03:14:00,040
Do you remember that American senator all
those years ago?

2745
03:14:00,040 --> 03:14:03,939
He said the world was too complicated for
true gentlemen.

2746
03:14:03,939 --> 03:14:06,660
Well, he was right.

2747
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:11,310
You've seen how they have used his lordship,
haven't you, Stevens?'

2748
03:14:11,310 --> 03:14:14,600
'I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot say that I have.'

2749
03:14:14,600 --> 03:14:20,859
'Well, I don't know about you, Stevens, but
I'm going to do something about it.

2750
03:14:20,859 --> 03:14:24,810
If Father were alive, he would do something
to stop it.

2751
03:14:24,810 --> 03:14:30,260
You have no idea what they're discussing in
that room across the hall, Stevens?

2752
03:14:30,260 --> 03:14:32,119
Then I'll tell you.

2753
03:14:32,119 --> 03:14:37,740
His lordship has been trying to persuade the
Prime Minister to accept an invitation to

2754
03:14:37,740 --> 03:14:39,040
visit Herr Hitler.

2755
03:14:39,040 --> 03:14:41,699
And that is not all, Stevens.

2756
03:14:41,699 --> 03:14:47,860
His lordship is discussing the possibility
of a royal visit to Germany.

2757
03:14:47,860 --> 03:14:51,970
Everybody knows the new king has always been
enthusiastic about the Nazis.

2758
03:14:51,970 --> 03:14:56,800
Well, apparently he's keen to accept Herr
Hitler's invitation.

2759
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:01,289
His lordship is now trying to persuade the
British government to agree to this awful

2760
03:15:01,289 --> 03:15:02,289
idea.'

2761
03:15:02,289 --> 03:15:08,920
'I'm sorry, sir, but I have to say that I
trust his lordship's judgement completely.'

2762
03:15:08,920 --> 03:15:11,990
At that moment I heard the bell from the drawing
room.

2763
03:15:11,990 --> 03:15:15,439
I asked Mr Cardinal to excuse me, and I left
the room.

2764
03:15:15,439 --> 03:15:20,820
In the drawing room, the air was thick with
tobacco smoke.

2765
03:15:20,820 --> 03:15:25,770
The gentlemen sat and smoked in silence, while
his lordship asked me to bring up a bottle

2766
03:15:25,770 --> 03:15:28,810
of wine from the cellar.

2767
03:15:28,810 --> 03:15:33,570
As I was making my way along the darkness
of the corridor towards the cellar, the door

2768
03:15:33,570 --> 03:15:36,380
to Miss Kenton's room suddenly opened.

2769
03:15:36,380 --> 03:15:43,060
'I am surprised to find you still awake, Miss
Kenton,' I said when I saw her in the doorway.

2770
03:15:43,060 --> 03:15:47,750
'Mr Stevens, I was very foolish earlier,'
she said.

2771
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:52,399
'Excuse me, Miss Kenton, but I have no time
to talk just now.'

2772
03:15:52,399 --> 03:15:57,430
'Mr Stevens, you must not take anything I
said earlier seriously.

2773
03:15:57,430 --> 03:15:59,229
I was simply being foolish.'

2774
03:15:59,229 --> 03:16:04,460
'Miss Kenton, I cannot remember what you may
be referring to.

2775
03:16:04,460 --> 03:16:11,409
Besides, events of great importance are developing
upstairs, and I cannot stop to chat with you.

2776
03:16:11,409 --> 03:16:13,229
I suggest that you go to bed.'

2777
03:16:13,229 --> 03:16:17,210
With that, I hurried on.

2778
03:16:17,210 --> 03:16:19,970
It did not take me long to find the bottle
in the cellar.

2779
03:16:19,970 --> 03:16:25,329
Just a few minutes after my brief meeting
with Miss Kenton, I was walking along the

2780
03:16:25,329 --> 03:16:28,860
corridor again on my return journey.

2781
03:16:28,860 --> 03:16:33,640
As I approached Miss Kenton's door, I saw
from the light around its edges that she was

2782
03:16:33,640 --> 03:16:35,229
still awake.

2783
03:16:35,229 --> 03:16:41,029
And that was the moment, I am now sure, that
has remained clearly in my memory to this

2784
03:16:41,029 --> 03:16:43,029
day.

2785
03:16:43,029 --> 03:16:50,350
At that moment, as I paused in the darkness
of the corridor, a tray in my hands, something

2786
03:16:50,350 --> 03:16:58,680
told me that just a few metres away, on the
other side of the door, Miss Kenton was crying.

2787
03:16:58,680 --> 03:17:02,020
I do not know why I was so sure of this.

2788
03:17:02,020 --> 03:17:07,449
I had certainly not heard any sounds of crying.

2789
03:17:07,449 --> 03:17:11,569
I do not know how long I remained standing
there.

2790
03:17:11,569 --> 03:17:16,750
At the time it seemed a significant period,
but in reality it was probably only a few

2791
03:17:16,750 --> 03:17:17,750
seconds.

2792
03:17:17,750 --> 03:17:23,989
For, of course, I was required to hurry upstairs
to serve some of the most important gentlemen

2793
03:17:23,989 --> 03:17:25,750
in Europe.

2794
03:17:25,750 --> 03:17:30,270
I'm sure that I would not have delayed there
for long.

2795
03:17:30,270 --> 03:17:36,000
After serving the gentlemen in the drawing
room, I returned to my position in the hall.

2796
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:41,470
I stood there for another hour until the gentlemen
finally departed.

2797
03:17:41,470 --> 03:17:45,939
As I stood there, a strange thing began to
happen.

2798
03:17:45,939 --> 03:17:50,279
I began to experience a deep feeling of pride.

2799
03:17:50,279 --> 03:17:56,920
I had, after all, just come through an extremely
difficult evening, throughout which I had

2800
03:17:56,920 --> 03:18:00,609
managed to preserve my dignity.

2801
03:18:00,609 --> 03:18:08,380
My father would have been proud of the way
I had performed my duty that night.

2802
03:18:08,380 --> 03:18:09,380
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

2803
03:18:09,380 --> 03:18:13,300
Old Friends

2804
03:18:13,300 --> 03:18:17,520
September 1956

2805
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:21,479
For many years I have often thought of visiting
the seaside town of Weymouth.

2806
03:18:21,479 --> 03:18:25,870
I have heard various people talk of pleasant
holidays here.

2807
03:18:25,870 --> 03:18:31,750
All of them mentioned the pier in particular,
and I have been walking up and down along

2808
03:18:31,750 --> 03:18:32,830
it for the last half-hour.

2809
03:18:32,830 --> 03:18:39,410
They especially recommended visiting the pier
in the evening, when it becomes lit up with

2810
03:18:39,410 --> 03:18:42,660
bulbs of various colours.

2811
03:18:42,660 --> 03:18:48,460
A moment ago, I learnt from an official that
the lights would be switched on soon, so I

2812
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:53,120
have decided to sit down here on this bench
and wait for them to come on.

2813
03:18:53,120 --> 03:18:58,460
I have a good view of the sun setting over
the sea.

2814
03:18:58,460 --> 03:19:03,420
Although there is still plenty of daylight
left - it has been a splendid day - I can

2815
03:19:03,420 --> 03:19:08,829
see, here and there, lights starting to come
on all along the shore.

2816
03:19:08,829 --> 03:19:15,449
I arrived in this town yesterday afternoon,
and have decided to remain here for a second

2817
03:19:15,449 --> 03:19:16,659
night.

2818
03:19:16,659 --> 03:19:22,740
I need a rest from motoring, and if I make
an early start tomorrow, I shall be back at

2819
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:26,430
Darlington Hall by tea-time.

2820
03:19:26,430 --> 03:19:31,260
It is now two days since my meeting with Miss
Kenton in the tea lounge of the Rose Garden

2821
03:19:31,260 --> 03:19:33,470
Hotel in Little Compton.

2822
03:19:33,470 --> 03:19:38,550
Miss Kenton surprised me by coming to the
hotel.

2823
03:19:38,550 --> 03:19:43,090
I was looking out of the window at the rain
when a member of the hotel staff came to inform

2824
03:19:43,090 --> 03:19:47,220
me that a lady wished to see me at reception.

2825
03:19:47,220 --> 03:19:52,880
I rose and left the dining hall, but at reception
I was told that the lady had gone into the

2826
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:54,159
tea lounge.

2827
03:19:54,159 --> 03:19:59,430
The tea lounge was empty apart from Miss Kenton.

2828
03:19:59,430 --> 03:20:04,659
She rose as I entered, smiled and held out
her hand to me.

2829
03:20:04,659 --> 03:20:07,779
'Ah, Mr Stevens.

2830
03:20:07,779 --> 03:20:09,949
How nice to see you again.'

2831
03:20:09,949 --> 03:20:12,279
'Mrs Benn, how lovely.'

2832
03:20:12,279 --> 03:20:20,910
We moved two armchairs close to the window,
and sat and talked for the next two hours.

2833
03:20:20,910 --> 03:20:26,200
While we talked together, the rain continued
to fall steadily on the square outside.

2834
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:32,649
A grey light from the window fell across her
face, and I noticed the lines around her eyes

2835
03:20:32,649 --> 03:20:33,649
and mouth.

2836
03:20:33,649 --> 03:20:40,199
But, on the whole, Miss Kenton looked surprisingly
similar to the person I remembered from twenty

2837
03:20:40,199 --> 03:20:42,160
years ago.

2838
03:20:42,160 --> 03:20:46,560
It was a great pleasure for me to see her
again.

2839
03:20:46,560 --> 03:20:51,390
For the first twenty minutes we chatted politely
about my journey.

2840
03:20:51,390 --> 03:20:56,689
As we talked, I began to notice other ways
in which Miss Kenton had changed since I last

2841
03:20:56,689 --> 03:20:57,689
saw her.

2842
03:20:57,689 --> 03:21:03,239
For instance, she appeared, somehow, slower.

2843
03:21:03,239 --> 03:21:09,020
It is possible that this was simply the calmness
that comes with age, but I could not help

2844
03:21:09,020 --> 03:21:14,270
thinking that it was more a sort of tiredness
with life.

2845
03:21:14,270 --> 03:21:20,080
Every now and then, when she was not speaking,
I thought I saw something like sadness in

2846
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:21,540
her expression.

2847
03:21:21,540 --> 03:21:25,500
But I may have been mistaken about this.

2848
03:21:25,500 --> 03:21:30,190
The initial awkwardness of our conversation
soon developed into something more relaxed

2849
03:21:30,190 --> 03:21:31,670
and personal.

2850
03:21:31,670 --> 03:21:37,370
We spent some time remembering various people
from the past, or exchanging recent news about

2851
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:38,659
them.

2852
03:21:38,659 --> 03:21:42,359
This was, I must say, most enjoyable.

2853
03:21:42,359 --> 03:21:47,109
As we talked, the past began to come back
to life for me.

2854
03:21:47,109 --> 03:21:51,670
It was not just the memory of people and places
that we talked about.

2855
03:21:51,670 --> 03:21:57,130
I watched Miss Kenton while she was speaking,
and suddenly recognized little expressions

2856
03:21:57,130 --> 03:22:02,920
on her face, little movements of her hands,
that brought back memories of our conversations

2857
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:05,430
all those years ago.

2858
03:22:05,430 --> 03:22:10,800
The little smile that she gave when she finished
speaking, and a certain gesture with her shoulders,

2859
03:22:10,800 --> 03:22:14,930
had not changed at all.

2860
03:22:14,930 --> 03:22:20,029
After we had talked about people we had once
known, Miss Kenton began to tell me about

2861
03:22:20,029 --> 03:22:21,859
herself.

2862
03:22:21,859 --> 03:22:27,810
I learnt, for instance, that her marriage
to Mr Benn was not in as much trouble as I

2863
03:22:27,810 --> 03:22:30,550
had understood from her letter.

2864
03:22:30,550 --> 03:22:35,100
Although she had left her home for a period
of four or five days - which was when she

2865
03:22:35,100 --> 03:22:40,500
had written me her letter - she had returned,
and Mr Benn had been very pleased to have

2866
03:22:40,500 --> 03:22:41,899
her back.

2867
03:22:41,899 --> 03:22:49,310
'It is fortunate that one of us is sensible
about these things,' she said with a smile.

2868
03:22:49,310 --> 03:22:54,479
I am, of course, aware that details of Miss
Kenton's personal life with her husband were

2869
03:22:54,479 --> 03:22:56,830
really not my business.

2870
03:22:56,830 --> 03:23:01,630
I would not have talked to her about such
private matters if there had not been an important

2871
03:23:01,630 --> 03:23:03,399
professional reason.

2872
03:23:03,399 --> 03:23:09,210
And my reason for encouraging conversation
on this subject was the present staffing problem

2873
03:23:09,210 --> 03:23:10,779
at Darlington Hall.

2874
03:23:10,779 --> 03:23:15,490
But Miss Kenton did not seem to mind talking
to me about these matters.

2875
03:23:15,490 --> 03:23:20,850
In my opinion, this is pleasing evidence of
the fact that we had once enjoyed a close

2876
03:23:20,850 --> 03:23:24,340
working relationship together.

2877
03:23:24,340 --> 03:23:30,250
For a short time, Miss Kenton went on talking
more generally about her husband, who is retiring

2878
03:23:30,250 --> 03:23:33,170
soon because of the health.

2879
03:23:33,170 --> 03:23:37,890
She also talked to me about her daughter,
who is now married and expecting a child in

2880
03:23:37,890 --> 03:23:39,500
the autumn.

2881
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:44,740
In fact, Miss Kenton gave me her daughter's
address in Dorset.

2882
03:23:44,740 --> 03:23:48,180
'Catherine's heard all about you, Mr Stevens,'
she said.

2883
03:23:48,180 --> 03:23:50,700
'She'd be so thrilled to meet you.'

2884
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:55,329
Then I began to tell her about myself.

2885
03:23:55,329 --> 03:23:59,990
I tried to describe to her what Darlington
Hall is like today.

2886
03:23:59,990 --> 03:24:05,710
I attempted to tell her what a good employer
Mr Farraday is, and I described the changes

2887
03:24:05,710 --> 03:24:08,970
to the house itself and the present staffing
arrangements.

2888
03:24:08,970 --> 03:24:14,869
Miss Kenton, I thought, became visibly happier
when I talked about the house, and we were

2889
03:24:14,869 --> 03:24:18,670
soon laughing again together over various
old memories.

2890
03:24:18,670 --> 03:24:23,689
I spoke about Lord Darlington only once.

2891
03:24:23,689 --> 03:24:29,030
We had been talking about the young Mr Cardinal,
and I had to tell Miss Kenton that he had

2892
03:24:29,030 --> 03:24:32,780
been tragically killed in Belgium during the
war.

2893
03:24:32,780 --> 03:24:33,780
I continued:

2894
03:24:33,780 --> 03:24:38,290
'Of course, his lordship was very fond of
Mr Cardinal.

2895
03:24:38,290 --> 03:24:42,279
He suffered very badly when the young man
died.'

2896
03:24:42,279 --> 03:24:47,630
I did not wish to spoil the pleasant atmosphere
with unhappy talk, so I quickly tried to change

2897
03:24:47,630 --> 03:24:48,910
the subject.

2898
03:24:48,910 --> 03:24:53,680
However, Miss Kenton wanted to hear more about
Lord Darlington.

2899
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:59,210
She had read in the newspapers about his unsuccessful
court action and, inevitably, took the opportunity

2900
03:24:59,210 --> 03:25:01,439
to ask me about it.

2901
03:25:01,439 --> 03:25:08,189
'The fact is, Mrs Benn, throughout the war,
people said some truly terrible things about

2902
03:25:08,189 --> 03:25:10,260
his lordship.

2903
03:25:10,260 --> 03:25:15,279
The newspaper that young Mr Cardinal worked
for was especially vicious towards him.

2904
03:25:15,279 --> 03:25:20,890
His lordship did nothing about it while the
country was in danger, but the accusations

2905
03:25:20,890 --> 03:25:24,390
against him continued after the war had ended.

2906
03:25:24,390 --> 03:25:27,680
He was unable to continue suffering in silence.

2907
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:33,779
His lordship sincerely believed that he would
get justice if he took that newspaper to court.

2908
03:25:33,779 --> 03:25:40,000
Instead, of course, the newspaper simply became
more popular, and his lordship's good name

2909
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:42,250
was destroyed for ever.

2910
03:25:42,250 --> 03:25:46,120
Afterwards, his lordship became very ill.

2911
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:48,590
The house became so quiet.

2912
03:25:48,590 --> 03:25:52,050
I would take him tea in the drawing room and,
well...

2913
03:25:52,050 --> 03:25:54,640
it really was most tragic to see.'

2914
03:25:54,640 --> 03:25:57,729
'I'm very sorry, Mr Stevens.

2915
03:25:57,729 --> 03:26:00,689
I had no idea things had been so bad.'

2916
03:26:00,689 --> 03:26:03,300
'Oh yes, Mrs Benn.

2917
03:26:03,300 --> 03:26:04,680
But enough of this.

2918
03:26:04,680 --> 03:26:10,060
I know you remember Darlington Hall in the
days when it was filled with important visitors.

2919
03:26:10,060 --> 03:26:13,609
That is how his lordship deserves to be remembered.'

2920
03:26:13,609 --> 03:26:17,479
We did not mention Lord Darlington again.

2921
03:26:17,479 --> 03:26:23,149
We talked for the rest of the time about happy
memories, and we spent an extremely pleasant

2922
03:26:23,149 --> 03:26:27,079
two hours together in the tea lounge of the
Rose Garden Hotel.

2923
03:26:27,079 --> 03:26:33,340
Indeed, I could hardly believe that two whole
hours had passed when Miss Kenton looked up

2924
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:37,710
at the clock and said that she would have
to return home.

2925
03:26:37,710 --> 03:26:42,020
When I discovered that she would have to walk
in the rain to a bus stop just outside the

2926
03:26:42,020 --> 03:26:46,739
village, I insisted on taking her there in
the Ford.

2927
03:26:46,739 --> 03:26:51,810
Soon we were motoring together down the village
high street, past the shops, and out into

2928
03:26:51,810 --> 03:26:53,590
the open country.

2929
03:26:53,590 --> 03:26:59,340
Miss Kenton sat quietly watching the passing
view, then turned to me and said:

2930
03:26:59,340 --> 03:27:04,300
'Why are you smiling to yourself like that,
Mr Stevens?'

2931
03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:05,920
'Oh...

2932
03:27:05,920 --> 03:27:10,880
You must excuse me, Mrs Benn, but I was just
thinking about some of the things you wrote

2933
03:27:10,880 --> 03:27:12,460
in your letter.

2934
03:27:12,460 --> 03:27:18,020
I was a little worried when I read them, but
I see now that there was no cause for alarm.'

2935
03:27:18,020 --> 03:27:20,789
'Oh?

2936
03:27:20,789 --> 03:27:24,990
What things in particular are you referring
to, Mr Stevens?'

2937
03:27:24,990 --> 03:27:33,090
'Well, for instance, Mrs Benn,' I said with
a laugh, 'in one part of your letter you write:

2938
03:27:33,090 --> 03:27:36,830
The rest of my life stretches out emptily
before me.

2939
03:27:36,830 --> 03:27:38,680
Or something like that.'

2940
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:42,930
'Really, Mr Stevens,' she said, also laughing
a little.

2941
03:27:42,930 --> 03:27:45,270
'I could not have written that.'

2942
03:27:45,270 --> 03:27:48,289
'I assure you, Mrs Benn, you did.

2943
03:27:48,289 --> 03:27:50,729
I recall it very clearly.'

2944
03:27:50,729 --> 03:27:52,649
'Oh dear.

2945
03:27:52,649 --> 03:27:56,350
Well, perhaps there are some days when I feel
like that.

2946
03:27:56,350 --> 03:27:59,829
But they pass quickly enough.

2947
03:27:59,829 --> 03:28:05,649
Let me assure you, Mr Stevens, my life does
not stretch out emptily before me.

2948
03:28:05,649 --> 03:28:12,020
For instance, my husband and I are both looking
forward to becoming grandparents.'

2949
03:28:12,020 --> 03:28:14,119
'Yes, indeed.

2950
03:28:14,119 --> 03:28:18,289
That will be splendid for you.'

2951
03:28:18,289 --> 03:28:21,289
We drove on quietly for a few moments.

2952
03:28:21,289 --> 03:28:23,320
Then Miss Kenton said:

2953
03:28:23,320 --> 03:28:25,390
'And what about you, Mr Stevens?

2954
03:28:25,390 --> 03:28:29,779
What does the future hold for you back at
Darlington Hall?'

2955
03:28:29,779 --> 03:28:33,110
'There is work, Mrs Benn.

2956
03:28:33,110 --> 03:28:35,720
Work and more work.

2957
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:39,510
I wish I had some emptiness to look forward
to.'

2958
03:28:39,510 --> 03:28:41,930
We both laughed at this.

2959
03:28:41,930 --> 03:28:45,369
Then Miss Kenton pointed to a bus shelter
further along the road.

2960
03:28:45,369 --> 03:28:48,079
As we approached it, she said:

2961
03:28:48,079 --> 03:28:50,920
'Will you wait with me, Mr Stevens?

2962
03:28:50,920 --> 03:28:55,210
The bus will only be a few minutes.'

2963
03:28:55,210 --> 03:28:59,819
The rain was still falling steadily as we
got out of the car and hurried towards the

2964
03:28:59,819 --> 03:29:02,229
shelter.

2965
03:29:02,229 --> 03:29:05,189
Miss Kenton sat on the seat that was provided.

2966
03:29:05,189 --> 03:29:13,239
I, however, remained on my feet where I would
have a clear view of the approaching bus.

2967
03:29:13,239 --> 03:29:18,449
After we had been waiting in silence for a
few minutes, I finally managed to say:

2968
03:29:18,449 --> 03:29:21,539
'Excuse me, Mrs Benn.

2969
03:29:21,539 --> 03:29:26,289
But the fact is, we may not meet again for
a long time.

2970
03:29:26,289 --> 03:29:31,899
I wonder if you would perhaps permit me to
ask you a rather personal question.

2971
03:29:31,899 --> 03:29:35,409
It is something that has been bothering me
for some time.'

2972
03:29:35,409 --> 03:29:37,520
'Certainly, Mr Stevens.

2973
03:29:37,520 --> 03:29:40,240
We are old friends, after all.'

2974
03:29:40,240 --> 03:29:44,979
'Indeed, as you say, we are old friends.

2975
03:29:44,979 --> 03:29:48,720
Please do not reply if you feel you shouldn't.

2976
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:55,220
But the fact is, over the years I have had
a number of letters from you, and they have

2977
03:29:55,220 --> 03:30:00,600
all seemed to suggest that you are - how might
one express it?

2978
03:30:00,600 --> 03:30:02,900
- rather unhappy.

2979
03:30:02,900 --> 03:30:08,170
I simply wondered if you were being badly
treated in some way.

2980
03:30:08,170 --> 03:30:12,699
Forgive me, but I have been worried about
this for some time.'

2981
03:30:12,699 --> 03:30:18,140
'Mr Stevens, there is no need to be so embarrassed.

2982
03:30:18,140 --> 03:30:21,750
We are old friends after all, are we not?

2983
03:30:21,750 --> 03:30:26,239
In fact, I'm very grateful that you are so
concerned.

2984
03:30:26,239 --> 03:30:29,119
And I can reassure you on this matter absolutely.

2985
03:30:29,119 --> 03:30:34,159
My husband does not treat me badly in any
way.

2986
03:30:34,159 --> 03:30:38,540
He is not a cruel or bad-tempered man at all.'

2987
03:30:38,540 --> 03:30:41,280
'I am so pleased to hear that, Mrs Benn.'

2988
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:46,990
I leaned forward into the rain, looking for
signs of the bus.

2989
03:30:46,990 --> 03:30:53,870
'I can see you are not very satisfied, Mr
Stevens,' Miss Kenton said.

2990
03:30:53,870 --> 03:30:55,479
'Don't you believe me?'

2991
03:30:55,479 --> 03:30:58,630
'It's not that, Mrs Benn.

2992
03:30:58,630 --> 03:31:00,729
Not that at all.

2993
03:31:00,729 --> 03:31:06,280
It's just that you do not seem to have been
very happy over the years.

2994
03:31:06,280 --> 03:31:12,130
You have - forgive me - left your husband
a number of times.

2995
03:31:12,130 --> 03:31:15,789
If he does not treat you badly, then, well...

2996
03:31:15,789 --> 03:31:20,859
I find the cause of your unhappiness rather
difficult to understand.'

2997
03:31:20,859 --> 03:31:25,600
I looked out into the rain again.

2998
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:28,870
Eventually, I heard Miss Kenton say behind
me:

2999
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:31,319
'Mr Stevens, how can I explain?

3000
03:31:31,319 --> 03:31:34,989
I hardly know myself why I do such things.

3001
03:31:34,989 --> 03:31:38,700
But it is true, I have left him three times.'

3002
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:44,810
She paused a moment while I continued to look
out towards the fields on the other side of

3003
03:31:44,810 --> 03:31:45,810
the road.

3004
03:31:45,810 --> 03:31:46,810
Then she said:

3005
03:31:46,810 --> 03:31:51,699
'I suppose, Mr Stevens, you're asking whether
or not I love my husband.'

3006
03:31:51,699 --> 03:31:53,989
'Really, Mrs Benn, I would never...'

3007
03:31:53,989 --> 03:31:58,590
'I feel I should answer you, Mr Stevens,'
Mrs Benn interrupted me.

3008
03:31:58,590 --> 03:32:02,800
'As you say, we may not meet again for many
years.

3009
03:32:02,800 --> 03:32:05,100
Yes, I do love my husband.

3010
03:32:05,100 --> 03:32:07,010
I did not at first.

3011
03:32:07,010 --> 03:32:09,600
I did not for a long time.

3012
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:17,350
When I left Darlington Hall all those years
ago, I never realized I was really, truly

3013
03:32:17,350 --> 03:32:18,350
leaving.

3014
03:32:18,350 --> 03:32:22,340
I believe I thought of it, Mr Stevens, as
simply another way to annoy you.

3015
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:26,390
It was a shock to come out here and find myself
married.

3016
03:32:26,390 --> 03:32:30,520
For a long time I was very unhappy, very unhappy
indeed.

3017
03:32:30,520 --> 03:32:34,140
But then the years passed, there was the war
and Catherine grew up.

3018
03:32:34,140 --> 03:32:37,340
Then suddenly, one day, I realized that I
loved my husband.

3019
03:32:37,340 --> 03:32:41,829
If you spend so much time with someone, you
get used to him.

3020
03:32:41,829 --> 03:32:48,760
He is a kind, steady man, and yes, Mr Stevens,
I do love him.'

3021
03:32:48,760 --> 03:32:52,010
Miss Kenton fell silent again for a moment.

3022
03:32:52,010 --> 03:32:58,090
Then she went on: 'But there are times, of
course, when one thinks to oneself: "What

3023
03:32:58,090 --> 03:33:02,149
a terrible mistake I have made with my life."

3024
03:33:02,149 --> 03:33:07,819
And one thinks about a different life, a better
life one might have had.

3025
03:33:07,819 --> 03:33:16,000
For instance, I started to think about a life
I might have had with you, Mr Stevens.

3026
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:22,620
And I suppose that is when I get angry over
something small and unimportant and leave.

3027
03:33:22,620 --> 03:33:25,210
But I always return to my husband.

3028
03:33:25,210 --> 03:33:27,800
We cannot turn the clock back now.

3029
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:31,640
We cannot spend our lives dreaming about what
might have been.

3030
03:33:31,640 --> 03:33:35,470
One should be grateful for what one has.'

3031
03:33:35,470 --> 03:33:44,350
I do not think I responded immediately, for
it took me a moment or two to fully understand

3032
03:33:44,350 --> 03:33:45,570
her words.

3033
03:33:45,570 --> 03:33:52,729
Moreover, the implication of Miss Kenton's
words did create a certain amount of sorrow

3034
03:33:52,729 --> 03:33:53,750
within me.

3035
03:33:53,750 --> 03:33:57,329
Indeed - why should I not admit it?

3036
03:33:57,329 --> 03:34:00,359
- at that moment, my heart was breaking.

3037
03:34:00,359 --> 03:34:05,420
Before long, however, I turned to her and
said with a smile:

3038
03:34:05,420 --> 03:34:07,279
'You are absolutely right, Mrs Benn.

3039
03:34:07,279 --> 03:34:13,270
As you say, it is too late to turn back the
clock.

3040
03:34:13,270 --> 03:34:17,079
We must both be grateful for what we do have.

3041
03:34:17,079 --> 03:34:26,920
And from what you tell me, Mrs Benn, you have
many good reasons for feeling happy.

3042
03:34:26,920 --> 03:34:34,050
In fact, it seems that you and Mr Benn have
some extremely happy years ahead of you.

3043
03:34:34,050 --> 03:34:40,160
You really must not let any more foolish ideas
come between yourself and the happiness you

3044
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:41,160
deserve.'

3045
03:34:41,160 --> 03:34:45,000
'Of course, you are right, Mr Stevens.

3046
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:47,409
You are so kind.'

3047
03:34:47,409 --> 03:34:52,869
'Ah, Mrs Benn, I think that the bus is coming
now.'

3048
03:34:52,869 --> 03:34:59,479
I stepped out into the rain and signalled,
while Miss Kenton stood up and waited at the

3049
03:34:59,479 --> 03:35:01,729
edge of the shelter.

3050
03:35:01,729 --> 03:35:10,310
As the bus slowed down, I glanced at Miss
Kenton and noticed that her eyes had filled

3051
03:35:10,310 --> 03:35:11,369
with tears.

3052
03:35:11,369 --> 03:35:13,229
I smiled and said:

3053
03:35:13,229 --> 03:35:18,530
'Now, Mrs Benn, you must take good care of
yourself.

3054
03:35:18,530 --> 03:35:26,479
Many people say that retirement is the best
part of life for a married couple.

3055
03:35:26,479 --> 03:35:31,250
You must make these years happy ones for yourself
and your husband.

3056
03:35:31,250 --> 03:35:37,660
We may never meet again, Mrs Benn, so I ask
you to remember what I have just said to you.'

3057
03:35:37,660 --> 03:35:40,840
'I will, Mr Stevens, thank you.

3058
03:35:40,840 --> 03:35:43,080
And thank you for the lift.

3059
03:35:43,080 --> 03:35:45,670
It was so very kind of you.

3060
03:35:45,670 --> 03:35:47,950
It was so nice to see you again.'

3061
03:35:47,950 --> 03:35:50,840
'It was a great pleasure to see you again,
Mrs Benn.'

3062
03:35:50,840 --> 03:35:51,840
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

3063
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:52,840
The Best Part of the Day

3064
03:35:52,840 --> 03:35:58,699
The pier lights have been switched on, and
a crowd of people behind me have just given

3065
03:35:58,699 --> 03:36:00,220
a loud cheer to celebrate this event.

3066
03:36:00,220 --> 03:36:04,569
There is still plenty of daylight left - the
sky over the sea has turned a pale red - but

3067
03:36:04,569 --> 03:36:10,100
it seems to me that everybody on this pier
will be happy for night to fall.

3068
03:36:10,100 --> 03:36:14,890
This confirms something that the man who was
next to me on this bench said to me a short

3069
03:36:14,890 --> 03:36:15,890
time ago.

3070
03:36:15,890 --> 03:36:20,350
He claimed that, for many people, the evening
was the best part of the day.

3071
03:36:20,350 --> 03:36:23,550
It was the part of the day that they most
looked forward to.

3072
03:36:23,550 --> 03:36:26,670
There seems to be some truth in this.

3073
03:36:26,670 --> 03:36:35,290
Otherwise, why would people cheer so loudly
simply because the pier lights have come on?

3074
03:36:35,290 --> 03:36:41,199
The man had been sitting next to me for some
minutes before I noticed him.

3075
03:36:41,199 --> 03:36:42,199
I was so lost in my own thoughts that I did
not know he was there until he said:

3076
03:36:42,199 --> 03:36:43,199
'Sea air is very good for you.'

3077
03:36:43,199 --> 03:36:44,199
He was a heavily built man in his late sixties,
wearing an old brown jacket and an open-necked

3078
03:36:44,199 --> 03:36:45,199
shirt.

3079
03:36:45,199 --> 03:36:46,199
He was staring out across the water, so I
was not sure whether he was talking to me.

3080
03:36:46,199 --> 03:36:47,199
But since no one else responded, I eventually
said:

3081
03:36:47,199 --> 03:36:48,199
'Yes, I'm sure it is.'

3082
03:36:48,199 --> 03:36:49,199
'The doctor says it's good for you, so I come
up here as often as I can.'

3083
03:36:49,199 --> 03:36:50,199
The man went on to tell me about his various
illnesses.

3084
03:36:50,199 --> 03:36:51,199
He turned to me occasionally and gave me a
nod or a grin, but most of the time he kept

3085
03:36:51,199 --> 03:36:52,199
staring out to sea.

3086
03:36:52,199 --> 03:36:53,199
I only really started to pay him attention,
however, when he mentioned that he had once

3087
03:36:53,199 --> 03:36:54,199
been a butler.

3088
03:36:54,199 --> 03:36:55,199
Until he retired three years ago, he had been
the butler in a small house near Weymouth.

3089
03:36:55,199 --> 03:36:56,199
He had been the only full-time member of staff.

3090
03:36:56,199 --> 03:36:57,199
When I asked him if he had ever worked with
a proper staff under him, perhaps before the

3091
03:36:57,199 --> 03:36:58,199
war, he replied:

3092
03:36:58,199 --> 03:36:59,199
'Oh, in those days I was just a footman.

3093
03:36:59,199 --> 03:37:00,199
I didn't have enough experience to be a butler
in those days.

3094
03:37:00,199 --> 03:37:01,199
Being a butler was a difficult job in those
big houses before the war.'

3095
03:37:01,199 --> 03:37:02,199
When he told me this, I thought it was appropriate
to reveal my identity.

3096
03:37:02,199 --> 03:37:03,199
My companion seemed suitably impressed when
I mentioned Darlington Hall.

3097
03:37:03,199 --> 03:37:04,199
'And I was trying to explain the job to you,'
he said with a laugh.

3098
03:37:04,199 --> 03:37:05,199
'You never know who you're talking to when
you meet a stranger.

3099
03:37:05,199 --> 03:37:06,199
So you had a big staff, I suppose.

3100
03:37:06,199 --> 03:37:07,199
Before the war, I mean.'

3101
03:37:07,199 --> 03:37:08,199
He was a cheerful fellow, and seemed genuinely
interested, so I was happy to tell him about

3102
03:37:08,199 --> 03:37:09,199
Darlington Hall in the old days.

3103
03:37:09,199 --> 03:37:10,199
Eventually, I said:

3104
03:37:10,199 --> 03:37:11,199
'Of course, things are quite different today
under my present employer.

3105
03:37:11,199 --> 03:37:12,199
An American gentleman.'

3106
03:37:12,199 --> 03:37:13,199
'Americans are the ones who can afford it
now,' he said, giving me a little grin.

3107
03:37:13,199 --> 03:37:14,199
'Yes,' I said, laughing a little.

3108
03:37:14,199 --> 03:37:15,199
'That's true.'

3109
03:37:15,199 --> 03:37:16,199
The man turned back to the sea again and took
a deep breath.

3110
03:37:16,199 --> 03:37:17,199
We sat quietly for several moments.

3111
03:37:17,199 --> 03:37:18,199
'The fact is, of course,' I said after a while,
'I gave my best to Lord Darlington.

3112
03:37:18,199 --> 03:37:19,199
I gave him the very best I had to give.

3113
03:37:19,199 --> 03:37:20,199
And now - well - I find I do not have much
left to give.'

3114
03:37:20,199 --> 03:37:21,199
The man nodded but said nothing, so I went
on:

3115
03:37:21,199 --> 03:37:22,199
'Since my new employer, Mr Farraday, arrived,
I've tried very hard.

3116
03:37:22,199 --> 03:37:23,199
But whatever I do, I find I'm making more
and more errors with my work.

3117
03:37:23,199 --> 03:37:24,199
Unimportant errors, it's true, but I would
never have made these errors in the past.

3118
03:37:24,199 --> 03:37:25,199
And I know what these errors mean.

3119
03:37:25,199 --> 03:37:26,199
I've given everything that I had to give.

3120
03:37:26,199 --> 03:37:27,199
I gave it all to Lord Darlington.'

3121
03:37:27,199 --> 03:37:28,199
'Oh dear, do you want a handkerchief?

3122
03:37:28,199 --> 03:37:29,199
I've got one somewhere,' my companion said.

3123
03:37:29,199 --> 03:37:30,199
'No thank you, it's quite all right.

3124
03:37:30,199 --> 03:37:31,199
I'm very sorry.

3125
03:37:31,199 --> 03:37:32,199
I'm afraid the travelling has made me tired.

3126
03:37:32,199 --> 03:37:33,199
I'm very sorry.'

3127
03:37:33,199 --> 03:37:34,199
'You must have been very devoted to this Lord
Darlington.

3128
03:37:34,199 --> 03:37:35,199
And he died three years ago, you say?'

3129
03:37:35,199 --> 03:37:36,199
'Lord Darlington wasn't a bad man.

3130
03:37:36,199 --> 03:37:37,199
He wasn't a bad man at all.

3131
03:37:37,199 --> 03:37:38,199
At least he was able to say at the end of
his life that he had made his own mistakes.

3132
03:37:38,199 --> 03:37:39,199
His lordship was a courageous man.

3133
03:37:39,199 --> 03:37:40,199
He chose a certain path in life.

3134
03:37:40,199 --> 03:37:41,199
It proved to be a mistaken path, but at least
he chose it for himself.

3135
03:37:41,199 --> 03:37:42,199
I cannot claim that about myself.

3136
03:37:42,199 --> 03:37:43,199
You see, I trusted in his lordship's wisdom.

3137
03:37:43,199 --> 03:37:44,199
All those years I served him, I trusted that
I was doing something worthwhile.

3138
03:37:44,199 --> 03:37:45,199
I can't even say I made my own mistakes.

3139
03:37:45,199 --> 03:37:46,199
Really - one has to ask oneself - where is
the dignity in that?'

3140
03:37:46,199 --> 03:37:47,199
'Now look, I'm not sure I understand everything
you're saying.

3141
03:37:47,199 --> 03:37:48,199
But if you ask me, your attitude's all wrong,
see?

3142
03:37:48,199 --> 03:37:49,199
Don't keep looking back all the time, you'll
only get depressed.

3143
03:37:49,199 --> 03:37:50,199
Maybe you can't do your job as well as you
used to, but it's the same for all of us.

3144
03:37:50,199 --> 03:37:51,199
We've all got to relax at some time.

3145
03:37:51,199 --> 03:37:52,199
Look at me - I've been very happy since I
retired.

3146
03:37:52,199 --> 03:37:53,199
We may not be as young as we were, but we
have to keep looking forward.'

3147
03:37:53,199 --> 03:37:54,199
I believe it was then that he said:

3148
03:37:54,199 --> 03:37:55,199
'You've got to enjoy yourself.

3149
03:37:55,199 --> 03:37:56,199
The evening's the best part of the day.

3150
03:37:56,199 --> 03:37:57,199
You've done your day's work.

3151
03:37:57,199 --> 03:37:58,199
Now you can relax and enjoy things.

3152
03:37:58,199 --> 03:37:59,199
That's how I look at it.

3153
03:37:59,199 --> 03:38:00,199
Ask anybody, they'll all tell you.

3154
03:38:00,199 --> 03:38:01,199
The evening's the best part of the day.'

3155
03:38:01,199 --> 03:38:02,199
'I'm sure you're quite correct,' I said.

3156
03:38:02,199 --> 03:38:03,199
'I'm sorry.

3157
03:38:03,199 --> 03:38:04,199
I'm probably too tired.

3158
03:38:04,199 --> 03:38:06,909
I've been travelling rather a lot, you see.'

3159
03:38:06,909 --> 03:38:12,390
The man left twenty minutes ago, but I have
remained here on this bench to witness the

3160
03:38:12,390 --> 03:38:15,550
switching on of the pier lights.

3161
03:38:15,550 --> 03:38:20,909
As I have already said, the happiness of the
people around me at this small event seems

3162
03:38:20,909 --> 03:38:24,740
to confirm what my companion said.

3163
03:38:24,740 --> 03:38:29,870
For many people, the evening is the most enjoyable
part of the day.

3164
03:38:29,870 --> 03:38:32,350
Perhaps I should stop looking back so much.

3165
03:38:32,350 --> 03:38:38,460
I should adopt a more positive attitude towards
what remains of my day.

3166
03:38:38,460 --> 03:38:43,470
After all, what purpose is there in forever
looking back and blaming ourselves for what

3167
03:38:43,470 --> 03:38:46,050
might or might not have happened?

3168
03:38:46,050 --> 03:38:52,869
The hard reality, for people like you and
me, is that our lives are in the hands of

3169
03:38:52,869 --> 03:38:56,939
those great gentlemen who employ our services.

3170
03:38:56,939 --> 03:39:03,620
What is the sense in worrying about whether
we could or could not have taken more control?

3171
03:39:03,620 --> 03:39:10,300
Surely it is enough that people like you and
me have at least tried to make a real contribution,

3172
03:39:10,300 --> 03:39:12,630
however small.

3173
03:39:12,630 --> 03:39:18,330
Whatever the result is, surely that is a reason
to be proud.

3174
03:39:18,330 --> 03:39:25,810
A few minutes ago, soon after the lights came
on, I turned around on my bench and studied

3175
03:39:25,810 --> 03:39:28,319
the crowd of people behind me.

3176
03:39:28,319 --> 03:39:31,050
They were laughing and chatting.

3177
03:39:31,050 --> 03:39:37,609
There are people of all ages wandering around
this pier: families with children, couples,

3178
03:39:37,609 --> 03:39:41,560
young and elderly, walking arm in arm.

3179
03:39:41,560 --> 03:39:46,550
I paid particular attention to a group of
six or seven people just a little way behind

3180
03:39:46,550 --> 03:39:47,550
me.

3181
03:39:47,550 --> 03:39:51,340
I thought at first that they were a group
of friends.

3182
03:39:51,340 --> 03:39:56,640
However, as I listened to their conversation,
I realized that they were strangers who had

3183
03:39:56,640 --> 03:39:59,079
never met before.

3184
03:39:59,079 --> 03:40:03,189
As I watch them now, they are all laughing
happily.

3185
03:40:03,189 --> 03:40:09,270
It is strange how people can build such warmth
among themselves so quickly It is possible

3186
03:40:09,270 --> 03:40:14,820
that these people are simply sharing the anticipation
of the evening ahead.

3187
03:40:14,820 --> 03:40:20,360
On the other hand, I think the warmth between
them is probably more a result of their skill

3188
03:40:20,360 --> 03:40:22,270
at bantering.

3189
03:40:22,270 --> 03:40:27,029
I can hear them exchanging one bantering remark
after another.

3190
03:40:27,029 --> 03:40:34,409
Perhaps it is time for me to pay more serious
attention to the subject of bantering.

3191
03:40:34,409 --> 03:40:40,319
After all, when one thinks about it, it is
not such a foolish thing to do - particularly

3192
03:40:40,319 --> 03:40:47,370
if, for some reason, it contains the key to
human warmth.

3193
03:40:47,370 --> 03:40:53,399
I have, of course, already spent much time
practising my bantering skills.

3194
03:40:53,399 --> 03:40:59,609
It is possible, however, that I need to be
more enthusiastic about it.

3195
03:40:59,609 --> 03:41:06,289
Perhaps, when I return to Darlington Hall
tomorrow - Mr Farraday will be away for another

3196
03:41:06,289 --> 03:41:10,750
week - I will make a new start.

3197
03:41:10,750 --> 03:41:16,210
I shall start practising bantering again with
new energy.

3198
03:41:16,210 --> 03:41:23,439
If I do this, I shall be able to pleasantly
surprise Mr Farraday with my new skill when

3199
03:41:23,439 --> 03:41:24,439
he returns.
