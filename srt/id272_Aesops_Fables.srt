00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,480
"Look at me!" said the Hare to the other animals.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
"Just look how fast I can run."

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,240
The Hare ran across a field as fast as he could.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,640
All the animals agreed that yes the Hare was very fast.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,680
The Hare ran back.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,720
"See," he shouted.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
"I'm not even out of breath."

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,800
"Yeah, that was fast," said a Fox.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,560
"So who wants a race?" said the Hare.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,480
"Anybody think they could beat me?"

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,840
None of the animals spoke.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,160
"See," said the Hare.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,880
"You're all too scared to even try."

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
"I'll have a go," said the Tortoise.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,200
The Hare laughed.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,960
"You? The slowest creature in the whole world? I'm not
wasting my time racing a Tortoise."

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,120
"What's the matter?" said the Tortoise.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,800
"Scared I might beat you?"

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:17,760
Some of the animals laughed at that so the Hare said, "Alright then, Tortoise. Let's have a race...right
now...then we'll see who's laughing."

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,000
"Not today," said the Tortoise.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,200
"We'll race next week. Got to do a bit of training first."

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,600
Next morning the animals watched the Tortoise do his
"training".

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:41,320
First he did some gentle stretching exercises to warm
himself up... and then he started to run.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,360
"Has he started running yet?" asked the Fox.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,720
"Hard to tell with Tortoises," said the Badger.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
"He's definitely moving."

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,960
"Is he?" said the Fox.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,280
"Tortoise, are you sure about this?" said the Crow.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
"I mean the Hare IS very fast and you…well…"

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,440
"Don't worry," said the Tortoise.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,800
"This is just day one. I'll speed up. You'll see."

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,920
On the day of the race crowds of animals came to watch.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:33,760
The Tortoise slowly made his way to the starting line and then suddenly... the Hare arrived at top speed wearing a
brand new track suit and four expensive-looking trainers.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,720
"The race starts here." said the Fox pointing to a line on
the ground.

36
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,880
"And ends at that tree on the other side of the field. First
one to touch the tree is the winner."

37
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,840
"Right, let's get on with it," said the Hare.

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,320
"Ready Tortoise? Ready to see some real speed?"

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,000
"I'm ready," said the Tortoise.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,360
"Ready, steady...go!" said the Fox and the race began.

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,280
The Hare roared off then stopped and looked back.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,200
The Tortoise was still crossing the starting line.

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,240
The Hare ran back to the Tortoise.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,560
"Didn't you hear him say go? You can start, you know."

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
"I have started," said the Tortoise.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
"Look," said the Hare.

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,920
"You're going so slowly I'm going to have a rest. Might even
have a little sleep. I'll finish the race when I wake up and still beat you by miles."

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,800
The Hare lay down in the sun and fell asleep.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,680
The Tortoise kept going.

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:59,360
Slowly, steadily he moved across the field and by evening
time he was getting close to the finishing tree.

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,080
Still the Hare slept on and now the animals started to get
excited.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,760
"You know what? I think he might win," said a Rabbit.

53
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,880
"I can't believe it," said the Badger.

54
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,520
"The Tortoise might actually win."

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:24,800
The animals started to get excited and as the Tortoise got
close to the finishing tree they started to cheer.

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,280
"Come on Tortoise," they shouted.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,160
"Nearly there. Keep going old friend. Keep going."

58
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,520
But the noise of the cheering crowd woke up the Hare.

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,960
He looked across the field, saw the Tortoise about to reach
the tree and in a flash he was running.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The Tortoise heard the Hare thundering up behind him but he
kept going...and going...and suddenly he was there.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Just in time the Tortoise touched the tree with his nose.

62
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
He'd done it.

63
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,440
The Tortoise had beaten the Hare fair and square.

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,120
"There you go," said the Badger.

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,120
"Slow and steady's sometimes better than fast and flashy."

66
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,760
"Not fair," said the Hare.

67
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,200
"I was asleep. We have to run the race again. It's not
fair."

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,520
But no-one was listening to the Hare.

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
THE FROGS AND THE OX

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:50,640
"Mum! Mum! Come quickly!" called the little frog, hopping
and skipping with excitement...

71
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,320
"Come and see the monster!" He called.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:07,440
"It's got two big spikes sticking out of its head and a
funny brush thing at the other end and it goes "OARRR AGH!"

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,160
And it kicks frogs."

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,640
"Not now dear," said the little frog's mother.

75
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,200
"Come on mum! Please!"

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,560
Mother frog looked more closely at the little one.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,120
"You're Stanley, aren't you?"

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
"No mum, I'm Zebadee."

79
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,880
"Are you really? You all look so alike."

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:41,320
She had 247 children, and it is hard to remember that many names, so she called everyone Stanley to give her memory a
rest.

81
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,000
"Mu-ummm…" cried Zebedee, "I haven't finished breakfast,
dear."

82
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,800
The little frog hesitated.

83
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,880
"Can I have some then?"

84
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,960
"No, Stanley," she said.

85
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:04,280
"You're not a tadpole any more. Go and find your own slugs -
and stop jiggling about, you're giving me a headache."

86
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,320
"I'm not jiggling about, I'm hopping about."

87
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:19,080
"Well stop it. It looks like exercise, and I can't be having with that sort of thing. How would it be if I were to flip
and flop about like you, doing exercise?"

88
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,240
The little frog thought about it.

89
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,080
"You wouldn't be so podgy," he said.

90
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,160
"Exactly!" said his mother.

91
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:37,120
"You don't get a jelly-belly like mine by exercising. I get all the exercise I need chewing. Now, what's all the fuss
about?"

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,480
"It's an Ox! And it's really gross and his shoes have split
down the middle."

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:50,080
"There are no such things as monsters, Stanley, and no
creature in the pond is bigger than me."

94
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,560
"But it is bigger than you, mum. Lot's bigger. I promise."

95
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
"Right!" said his mum.

96
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:05,960
"We'll see about that! I'll go with you, and if you are
telling fibs you'll have no worms for a week."

97
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,240
The damp hollow she sat in was home to a good assortment of
slugs.

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
But she had eaten too many of them.

99
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,880
The big jelly-belly she was so proud of made it difficult to
get about.

100
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,920
Now she could only half-hop, and flop, and then stop.

101
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,880
Hop, flop and stop, until she was all tired out and could go
no further.

102
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,320
"Stop, Stanley!"

103
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,280
"You've only moved half a metre, mum."

104
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,320
"Far enough," she wheezed.

105
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,080
She took a deep breath – and then she took a deep breath –
and then she took a deep breath.

106
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,480
"Is the ox as big as this?" she asked.

107
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,120
She sounded odd, because it's hard to speak, blown up like a
beach ball.

108
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,600
"Much bigger than that," said the little frog.

109
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,240
So she sucked in more air, and sucked in more air, and
sucked in more air.

110
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,560
"No, mum – it's still bigger…"

111
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:21,840
So she took in another breath, and …and…she shot into the air like an escaped balloon that zips around the room making
rude noises because you let go of the end.

112
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:35,640
"YAAAAAH!" she yelled, looping-the-loop and fizzing off in all directions before crashing - with a spectacular splash -
right in front of the ox!

113
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
The ox looked bored with the whole thing.

114
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Water dribbled from his mouth.

115
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,800
"Stanley!" she called back to the little frog a field and a
half away.

116
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,280
"Let that be a lesson to you!"

117
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,000
But the lesson was hers really.

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,720
THE FOX AND THE CROW

119
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:15,760
One morning a Fox was walking through the woods looking for something tasty to eat for his breakfast when his nose
picked up a scent - a scent of something very interesting.

120
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,080
He stood still and sniffed the air.

121
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,480
"Cheese," he said.

122
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,040
"I smell cheese. Now why would there be cheese in the middle
of a wood like this?"

123
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:44,600
The Fox didn't have to wait long to find out because there sitting on a branch high up in a tree sat a crow and in the
crow's beak was the biggest piece of cheese he'd ever seen.

124
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:55,360
Now the Fox loved cheese more than anything in the whole world and he decided that come what may he would have that
piece of cheese for himself.

125
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,400
"Morning Mr Crow," he said.

126
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,160
"Why don't you come down and have a little chat."

127
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,280
The Crow didn't reply.

128
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,400
He just sat on his branch and looked down at the Fox.

129
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,640
"He must think I'm stupid," thought the Crow to himself.

130
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:30,480
"That fox is after my cheese. If I fly down there he'll jump on me and gobble me up first and then the cheese. Foxes
can't climb trees so I'll just sit up here and enjoy my piece of cheese."

131
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,440
The Crow was just about to swallow his lump of cheese when
the Fox said.

132
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:52,960
"That cheese looks a bit mouldy to me. I wouldn't eat it if I were you. Mouldy cheese is very very dangerous. You could
easily get ill from bad cheese. If I were you I'd be on the safe side and just drop that cheese right now."

133
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,080
"Oh no," thought the Crow.

134
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:04,760
"I'm not falling for that. There's nothing wrong with this cheese. I found it fresh this morning. It smells wonderful
and I'm going to eat it right now."

135
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:12,920
The Crow looked straight at the Fox and waggled his piece of cheese as if to say "Look what I've got! Aren't I the lucky
one!"

136
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,800
"Right," thought the Fox.

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,720
"This Crow isn't quite as stupid as he looks. I'm going to
have to try something else."

138
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,800
"You know, Mr Crow," said the Fox, "you really do have the
most lovely feathers."

139
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,840
The Crow smiled to himself.

140
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
He was rather proud of his sleek black feathers.

141
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,160
The Fox was right.

142
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
They were rather lovely.

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
"And your head," said the Fox.

144
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,080
"Your head is very fine indeed. Makes you look fierce...but
wise at the same time."

145
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,280
"Right again," thought the Crow.

146
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,680
"That Fox knows what he's talking about because I do look
fierce... and I am very very wise."

147
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,360
"And I bet you've got the most beautiful singing voice too,"
said the Fox.

148
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,320
"I can tell just by looking at you. I mean all crows are
good singers..."

149
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
The Crow nodded.

150
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,560
"And I bet you're the best singer out of all the crows."

151
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,040
The Crow nodded again.

152
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:33,160
"See, I can tell you're a great singer just by looking at you. Oh how I'd love to hear you sing. Just once. That's all
I ask. Just one little song would make me so happy."

153
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,120
The Crow's mind was racing as the Fox started to walk away.

154
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,520
"Oh well I see I'm not in luck today," sighed the Fox.

155
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:49,840
"Suppose I'll just have to go and listen to a boring old sky
lark...or nightingale..."

156
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,960
The crow thought to himself.

157
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:07,080
"The Fox is right. I'm a wonderful singer. Much better than those boring nightingales...and larks...very over-rated...I
shall sing. I shall sing for the Fox right now."

158
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,960
As the crow opened his beak and started to sing...the piece
of cheese fell to the ground.

159
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,040
The Fox licked his lips.

160
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,920
"Thank you Mr Crow," he said.

161
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,960
"You can stop singing now. That horrible sound's spoiling my
breakfast."

162
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,680
"But you said you loved to hear a crow sing."

163
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:47,280
"Never believe what people tell you when they're trying to steal your cheese," said the Fox...and he winked at the crow
as he gobbled up the last little bit.

164
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,320
THE MONKEY AS KING

165
00:14:50,320 --> 00:15:01,920
There was a huge competition in the Indian jungle – and the
prize was – "To be King of the Beasts!"

166
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
It was very exciting!

167
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:13,160
To be King of all the Beasts was a grand thing – when you were King you got to wear a shiny crown and all the animals
had to call you "Sire".

168
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,720
Of course, lots of animals entered the competition.

169
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,480
Each animal got to say their piece on a big stage while the
other animals judged.

170
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,840
The first up on stage was Fox.

171
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,840
Fox was a very clever animal.

172
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:41,520
He spoke very well about the rights of the people and the duties of the King; but he used such long words like
"fiscal" and "jurisdiction" that most of the animals got bored and fell asleep.

173
00:15:41,560 --> 00:16:04,160
"And," said Fox, "never forget that there are many new traps
around in the jungle. Traps laid by Man to catch animals! Of course, there never was a trap made that could catch a fox. So this is my promise to you. If I am made King, I will educate each and every animal in avoiding these traps. Thank you."

174
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,960
Fox went off the stage and was met by Monkey.

175
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,440
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! That was a fine and educated speech you just
made!" said Monkey.

176
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,880
"Well, thank you Monkey," replied Fox, pleased.

177
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,000
"Yes – very clever you are," Monkey carried on.

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,240
"But that is not what the animals want in a king. Watch
this!"

179
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,680
And he bounded on to the stage.

180
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,520
"Thank you! Thank you!" he shouted.

181
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:43,240
"It's great to be here! You know - that Fox is a clever fellow. But – poor Fox - he's got no nose. How does he
smell, I hear you ask? He smells...AWFUL!"

182
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,080
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! Do you want to see me dance?" cried Monkey.

183
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,800
"YEH!" roared the audience.

184
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,120
And monkey danced.

185
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,920
He frolicked and he pranced and he capered and he danced!

186
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,040
And what faces he pulled!

187
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,680
Monkey was funny.

188
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,840
The audience laughed and roared and held their sides.

189
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,560
And that is how Monkey became King of the Beasts.

190
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:16,160
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! Well, Fox!" he smirked, as he paraded up and
down in his gold crown.

191
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,240
"Funny beats clever!"

192
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,240
"PA!" said Fox, angrily.

193
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,000
"We'll see about that!"

194
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,200
The next day, Fox saw Monkey lolling around in his throne
with his golden crown upon his head.

195
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,120
"No hard feelings…Sire," he said.

196
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,560
"You won, fair and square. And I want to give you a present
fit for a clever king."

197
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,760
"Oooh-ooh-ooh!" said Monkey.

198
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,520
"Being King is boring work! Where's your present?"

199
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,520
"It's a little way into the forest. Come with me!"

200
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,480
So Monkey and Fox set off into the forest together.

201
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,920
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! Where is it? Where is it?" said Monkey,
getting excited.

202
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,200
"There it is, Sire," said sly Fox, pointing at a big, ripe
banana on the jungle floor.

203
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,880
"YUM YUM!" cried Monkey, and dived off to pick it up.

204
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:17,120
Later that day, the animals were running around in
confusion.

205
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,800
"Where's the King?" they cried.

206
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,400
"Has anyone seen the King?"

207
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
At last they found him.

208
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,200
He was sitting – in a TRAP!

209
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Monkey held out his arms through the bars.

210
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,880
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! When I went to pick up a banana – this trap
fell over me! Please get me out!"

211
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,280
But none of the animals knew anything about traps - except
for Fox.

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,960
Fox sat down and curled his long red tail around him.

213
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,360
"Fox! Fox!" cried Monkey.

214
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,800
"Please help me!"

215
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
The Fox turned to look at the animals.

216
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,560
"Should a King be clever?" asked Fox

217
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,280
"Yes!" the animals cried.

218
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,880
"Does an animal that is clever fall in to a trap?" asked
Fox.

219
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,280
The animals were silent.

220
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,760
They looked at Monkey.

221
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
"You are a very foolish monkey," said Fox.

222
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:29,120
"I will get you out of the trap, but you must give up your crown. The King of the Beasts should be an animal that is
smarter than to fall into traps. Don't you think?"

223
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:38,200
And all the other animals agreed.

224
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,520
THE BUNDLE OF STICKS

225
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,280
Mrs Mckenzie had six strong sons.

226
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,320
They were Peter, Paul and Patrick, Philip, Frankie and Fred.

227
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,880
The only trouble was they couldn't stop arguing with each
other!

228
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,560
When Mrs Mckenzie wanted a well dug – do you think six
strong sons could do that?

229
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,960
"We'll dig a hole here!" said Peter.

230
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
"No – over here!" said Patrick.

231
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:19,040
And each of the six strong sons grabbed a spade and started
digging different holes in different parts of the garden!

232
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,000
"That's no use at all," she sighed.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Mrs Mckenzie asked her six strong sons to row her across the
river to see her friend.

234
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,440
"We'll do it!" cried Peter and Paul.

235
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,320
They leapt into the boat and sat down facing the front and
picked up oars.

236
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,640
"No we will!" shouted Patrick and Philip.

237
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,200
And they sat down facing backwards and picked up the oars.

238
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:55,560
And though they pulled at the oars until the sweat dripped off them – they were rowing the boat in opposite directions
and the boat went absolutely nowhere!

239
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,560
"Oh that's no use at all," she sighed.

240
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,720
One day there was a notice in the paper.

241
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:16,240
"Grand Competition to build the biggest barn in the county!"
it read. "£600 prize!" "I'll win that!" said Peter.

242
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,680
"No I'll win it!" said Paul.

243
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,040
Patrick, Philip, Frankie and Fred all disagreed…and they all
fell to arguing.

244
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,880
Suddenly, Mrs Mckenzie jumped to her feet.

245
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,240
"Quiet!" she said.

246
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,840
Then she climbed up on her chair.

247
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
"Quiet!" she shouted.

248
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,840
Then she climbed up right on top of the table.

249
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,320
"WILL YOU BE QUIET!" she roared.

250
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,160
Six sons went very, very quiet.

251
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
They looked up at their mother in astonishment.

252
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,800
"That's better," Mrs Mckenzie said.

253
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:06,120
"Now, you! Fetch me one of those big bundles of sticks that
we keep for the fire." "Yes Mum!" said Peter.

254
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,840
He ran out the door and came back with sticks tied together
in abundle as fat as your arm.

255
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,320
"Here you are Mum," he panted.

256
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,320
Mrs Mckenzie folded her arms.

257
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,440
"Now, my fine strong son, break that bundle in two!"

258
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
Peter smirked at his brothers.

259
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,600
"Easy!" he boasted, and he took the bundle in both hands.

260
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,360
He bent the bundle and he bowed the bundle but he could not
break the bundle.

261
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,600
"Well?" said Mrs Mckenzie, tapping her foot.

262
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,640
Peter hung his head in shame.

263
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:52,280
"I can't do it!" "Pass the bundle to Paul," said Mrs
Mckenzie.

264
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,080
"Ha, ha, ha! Watch this, ha, ha!" sneered Paul.

265
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,720
He bent the bundle and he bowed the bundle but he could not
break the bundle.

266
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,760
And neither could Patrick, Philip, Frankie or Fred.

267
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,160
"Give it to me!" said Mrs Mckenzie.

268
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,480
She took the bundle of sticks and untied the string.

269
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,040
She gave one stick to each of her sons.

270
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,040
"Can you break that?" she asked.

271
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
CRACK!

272
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,520
Went the sticks as the six strong sons easily broke them.

273
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,280
"And what have you broken?" asked Mrs Mckenzie.

274
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,200
"Er...a stick?" asked Peter, looking down at his hands.

275
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,240
"Yes," Mrs Mckenzie nodded.

276
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:51,720
"But between you, you have broken the bundle of sticks." The
six strong sons looked at each other.

277
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:59,520
"One of you wasn't strong enough," explained Mrs Mckenzie,
"but when you all worked together…"

278
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,640
"We were much stronger!" cried Peter, Paul, Patrick, Philip,
Frankie and Fred.

279
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,920
And so they were.

280
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:33,160
And do you know that when they went to the competition, the six strong sons of Mrs Mckenzie all worked together to build
the biggest barn in the county and they won that prize money.

281
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,000
All together.

282
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,480
THE GNAT AND THE LION

283
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,520
Far, far away in a hot land called Africa, lived a Gnat and
a Lion.

284
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,120
These two creatures were complete opposites.

285
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
One was weak and one was strong.

286
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,040
One was huge and one was tiny.

287
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,040
One was fierce and one was timid.

288
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,600
They met one dark night, and this is what happened.

289
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,560
The Gnat had gone to sleep.

290
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:14,280
He had made himself a swinging hammock on a blade of grass
and he was snoring gently.

291
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,960
The Lion was awake.

292
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,760
He was hunting - and his roar could be heard in the
distance.

293
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,160
It woke the Gnat.

294
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,000
"What is that?" he asked.

295
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,760
The Lion roared again.

296
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,280
The sound was even louder.

297
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,320
"It's getting closer," thought the Gnat, holding his breath.

298
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,120
A minute later the Lion came into view.

299
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,360
When the Gnat saw who it was he felt relieved.

300
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,800
"Oh!" he said.

301
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,880
"It's only you."

302
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
This annoyed the Lion.

303
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,600
"Only me!" he murmured silkily, narrowing his yellow eyes.

304
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,880
Are you aware I am the King of the Beasts."

305
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,160
When Lions narrow their eyes and murmur silkily, they are at
their most dangerous.

306
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,960
But the Gnat wasn't worried.

307
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,720
He opened his tiny mouth and yawned.

308
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,000
"You may be the King of the Beasts," he said, "but I can
outwit you anytime."

309
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,720
The Lion snorted.

310
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,600
"Ha!" he said.

311
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,200
"I could flatten you with one swipe of my paw."

312
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,840
The Gnat stood up on his spindly legs.

313
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,160
"Go on then," he said.

314
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:44,280
The lion raised his paw above his head and brought it down
as hard as he could.

315
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,840
The Gnat jumped out of the way.

316
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
"Missed," he said.

317
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,280
Humming a little tune he began buzzing round the Lions head.

318
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,200
"Zzzz, Zzzz, Zzzz,

319
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,400
Diddly, Diddly, Dee.

320
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,400
Zzzz, Zzzz, Zzzz,

321
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,960
Try And Catch Me."

322
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
The Lion was furious.

323
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,520
He twisted his head this way and that.

324
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,240
He snapped, he snarled, he swirled his tail, he swiped with
his paws.

325
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,680
But the Gnat was too nimble.

326
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,320
A thought came into the Lion's head.

327
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:25,040
"If I keep perfectly still, the Gnat will settle down, and I
can pounce."

328
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,760
But the Gnat didn't settle down.

329
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,360
He acted quickly.

330
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,240
He flew straight up the lions nose!

331
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,520
And began to bite.

332
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,840
Roaring with pain the Lion shook his head.

333
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,400
He stuffed his claws up his nose.

334
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,360
The Gnat pulled the hairs inside the Lion's nostrils.

335
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,560
"Make me the King of the Beasts," he called.

336
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,640
"Never," roared the Lion.

337
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,640
The Gnat bit him again.

338
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,800
The Lion's nose began to swell.

339
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,440
He could hardly breath.

340
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,400
"Say it," said the Gnat.

341
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,080
"Say - The Gnat is the King of the Beasts."

342
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,440
The Lion could bear it no longer.

343
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,920
"The Gnat is King of the beasts," he muttered.

344
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,800
His face hurt.

345
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,520
His nose was running.

346
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,560
His eyes were watering.

347
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:29,920
Without saying another word the once proud Lion turned and
disappeared into the long grass.

348
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,640
The Gnat was full of glee.

349
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,160
"I am the smartest creature that ever lived," he boasted.

350
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,960
He began looking for a new place to make his home.

351
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,520
He wanted something soft and comfortable.

352
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Ahead, draped over a bush was what looked like a white, lacy
shawl.

353
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,840
"That's perfect," said the Gnat.

354
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,000
And he wrapped himself in it.

355
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,440
At first, the Gnat didn't notice a small creature moving
swiftly towards him, climbing delicately over the lacy
threads.

356
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,560
When he did, it was too late.

357
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,960
"Hello, Gnat," said the Spider.

358
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,720
The Gnat tried to fly away, but he was stuck.

359
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,080
"You can't harm me," he said, "I'm the new King of the
Beasts."

360
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,360
"We'll see about that," said the Spider.

361
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,960
And he ate the Gnat for his supper.

362
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,160
THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN

363
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:58,440
It was a fine but very cold winter's day as the Sun shone
down on the snow-covered earth below.

364
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,600
"What a beautiful sight," it thought.

365
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:13,760
"And look at the little white sails of the ships on the blue
sea. I want to take my time travelling across the sky today. After all, what's the rush?"

366
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:21,960
Suddenly, a freezing cold blast of air screeched past – and
nearly blew the Sun along with it.

367
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,720
"Out of my way, Sun," roared the Wind.

368
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,000
"See those ships? I'm going to blow them right off course.
They won't know what's hit them…"

369
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,640
The Wind blew and blew – it blew so hard that the ship's
sails ripped apart.

370
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:48,840
All the Sun could do was watch as the sailors shivered in
the icy blast, shook their fists and cried out in anger.

371
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,200
"Not again, Wind," sighed the Sun.

372
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,840
"Why do you have to cause misery and chaos all the time?"

373
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,920
"Because I like showing just how strong I am," replied the
Wind.

374
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:10,760
"You sit in the sky and do nothing except shine, but I am
full of force and energy."

375
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,720
"Hmmm…" said the Sun, looking thoughtful.

376
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,880
"I have an idea. Let's have a contest to see which of us is
the stronger."

377
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,440
"I know who will win," said the Wind.

378
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,240
"We shall see," replied the Sun.

379
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,920
"Do you see that man down there?"

380
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,120
The Wind looked where the Sun was pointing.

381
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,440
A young man was walking along a windy road through the
mountains.

382
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,360
It was so cold, he was wearing a heavy winter coat to keep
warm.

383
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,760
"Let's see which one of us is strong enough to take his coat
off him," suggested the Sun.

384
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,200
"Easy, I can do that in no time," boasted the Wind.

385
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,680
"Go on then," said the Sun.

386
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:02,920
I'll watch you from behind a cloud."

387
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,800
The Wind blew and blew.

388
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,840
It blew so hard that the birds had to cling to the trees to
stop being swept away.

389
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,280
The man shivered and did up the top button of his coat as
the snow swirled in the air.

390
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:24,680
The Wind kept on blowing – but the more it did so, the
tighter the man pulled his coat around him to keep warm.

391
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,200
"I give up," gasped the Wind at last.

392
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
"I've got no more puff left."

393
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,200
"Now it's my turn," said the Sun as it emerged from the
cloud.

394
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,680
The Sun gently breathed in the cold air.

395
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,760
The stronger it breathed in, the larger and rounder it
seemed to glow.

396
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,200
On the white earth below the air was becoming warmer.

397
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,560
The Wind watched in awe as the snow began to melt.

398
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,720
Icicles were dripping and even the thick ice on the lakes
was starting to thaw and crack.

399
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,080
The man looked round in wonder at the melting landscape.

400
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,840
It had been such a long, cold winter that it was a joy to
feel the warmth of the Sun on his face.

401
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,320
He undid his top button, then a second…

402
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,880
"What a lovely day it's turning out to be," the man thought.

403
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:34,560
"It's too warm for this heavy winter coat. Everything is so bright and beautiful, I just want to enjoy the Sun and rest
a while – I might even have a little nap."

404
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:42,840
The Wind was beside itself with annoyance as the man sat
under the shade of a large rock and took off his coat.

405
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,840
It was so annoyed it kept making little angry puffs.

406
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:54,400
"Your icy blasts hardened his heart and made him
determination to keep his coat on," said the Sun.

407
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:05,080
"But my glowing rays opened his heart - and his coat
buttons. Look, I've cheered up those poor sailors too."

408
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,120
The sailors on the broken ships were cheering and waving up
at the Sun.

409
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:18,200
"Now they can mend their sails – and I shall carry on
shining until their ships can sail again," said the Sun.

410
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:25,560
Down below on the Earth, the young man looked up at the Sun
as if he had heard him speak.

411
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:38,320
"That Wind – it was strong. But the Sun is stronger still," he murmured to himself, before nodding off for a restful
sleep.

412
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:54,600
THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

413
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:11,560
One hot day at the end of summer a fox trotted along the dusty path to a farm, listening out for other creatures and
sniffing the air, as foxes do.

414
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:20,920
It was getting late, and after a long day the sun looked a little red in the face and had dropped out of sight behind a
bush.

415
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,320
It was the time of day that the fox liked best.

416
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,640
The farmer's work was finished.

417
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,320
He had taken off his muddy boots and gone inside for tea.

418
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,720
The fox only showed himself when the farmer had left his
boots outside.

419
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:49,960
Then, if he came running after the fox with his gun - as farmers do - he would first have to sit on the step, put his
boots back on again, and the fox would have plenty of time to run away.

420
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:58,440
The fox is certainly very clever, and handsome too, but no
one knows this better than the fox himself.

421
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,040
He would look at his reflection for hours admiring his
beautiful red coat with its snow white bib.

422
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,400
He would look at his smart black legs, which matched his
sleek black ears.

423
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,160
And his sleek black ears matched his shiny black nose, which
looked exactly like a small polished pebble.

424
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:29,520
But best of all, he thought, was his glorious bushy tail,
like a big, soft paintbrush dipped in whitewash.

425
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:41,960
The farmer locked in the hens at night, and the rabbits and geese, and he shooed the ducks onto their little island in
the middle of the duck pond so that the clever fox could not get them.

426
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,640
He knew the fox hated swimming.

427
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:53,480
But the fox did not only eat chickens and rabbits and ducks and geese, though he would put them all on the menu given
half a chance.

428
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:06,400
If he couldn't get into the hen house, and he couldn't swim to the duck island, and if the geese made a fuss and rattled
their beaks at him - as geese do - then there was always something else to eat.

429
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:16,080
There were slugs and grasshoppers and mice and worms and frogs and eggs and big meaty bones the farmer put out with
the rubbish.

430
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,320
And tonight there was fruit!

431
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,480
The fox looked up at a huge bunch of juicy grapes hanging
above his head.

432
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
He was very thirsty.

433
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,320
He could imagine the sweet, delicious juice running down his
chin.

434
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,560
But he couldn't reach them.

435
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,240
He was clever, though, wasn't he?

436
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:46,600
Everyone said so, and the fox was used to getting what he
wanted – so he would take a run at it, and…jump!

437
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,680
Missed!

438
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,160
He jumped again…And again.

439
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,360
He leaped and hopped and bounced and somersaulted.

440
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,520
But the juicy grapes were always just out of reach.

441
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,160
The fox stopped at last, hot and panting.

442
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,440
"Haaa well!" he said to himself.

443
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:17,880
"The grapes don't look that juicy and I just know they will be as bitter as lemons. Phooey! Who wants to eat sour
grapes!"

444
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:30,760
And the fox walked slowly along the dusty path back to his den with his nose in the air and his tail between his legs -
as hungry, disappointed foxes do.

445
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:38,600
Sometimes, when we can't get what we want, we pretend we
never wanted it anyway.

446
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:52,320
THE DOG, THE COCKEREL AND THE FOX

447
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:01,240
Dog lived in the farmyard and it was her job to let everyone
know when someone was at the gate.

448
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,840
And she did her job very well.

449
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,360
Cockerel lived in the farmyard too and it was his job to
wake everyone up in the morning!

450
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,240
He was an excellent alarm clock.

451
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,280
One day Dog said to Cockerel "Let's go for an adventure in
the big wide world."

452
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:29,640
"I'm not sure that's a good idea," Cockerel replied, "I've heard that there's a fox nearby whose favourite food is
cockerel pie!"

453
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:38,040
"Well if a fox tries to bake you in a pie!" said Dog, "I'll
soon sort him out…GRRRRR GRRRR!"

454
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,720
"In that case, I'll come with you!" said Cockerel.

455
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,520
So off they went.

456
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:54,840
The big wide world was wide indeed…with sky at the top and hills underneath and a squiggly path that seemed to go on
forever.

457
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:03,040
The two friends journeyed along the path, then, just as the
sun slipped behind the hills they came to a wood.

458
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,960
"It'll be dark soon," said Cockerel.

459
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,280
"Let's find a place to sleep."

460
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,360
"This tree looks perfect," woofed Dog, "it's big and it's
hollow, so I can curl up inside and keep guard!"

461
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,720
"And there's a wide branch where I can roost!" said
Cockerel.

462
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,160
Dog curled up in the hollow tree and Cockerel roosted on the
branch.

463
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,920
Suddenly they heard a sound.

464
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,960
"What was that?" said Cockerel.

465
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,400
"Just an owl," woofed Dog.

466
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:46,200
"Oh, thank goodness," said Cockerel, "I thought it was a fox
coming to gobble me up!"

467
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:54,680
"Yes," said Cockerel, "foxes are slinky and sneaky and sly
and their favourite food is cockerel pie!"

468
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:05,160
"I'll protect you!" said Dog, "A fox can't find you on that
branch anyway, not unless you cock-a-doodle-doo."

469
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,360
"That's true!" said Cockerel.

470
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,560
"Goodnight, Dog!"

471
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:17,680
"Goodnight, Cockerel - and remember not to cock-a-doodle-doo
in the morning, or the fox might hear you!"

472
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,400
Cockerel slept happily after that.

473
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,520
But in the morning when the sun came up, he thought he was
still on the farm.

474
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,800
So he let out a loud COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO.

475
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,960
Which woke up Fox.

476
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,680
"Ooops!" clucked Cockerel, "Now I've gone and done it!"

477
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,600
"Good morning, Cockerel," growled Fox.

478
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,560
"Good morning!" Cockerel replied nervously.

479
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,200
Fox narrowed his eyes, "I haven't seen you in this wood
before!"

480
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,320
"I only arrived last night," clucked Cockerel nervously.

481
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:06,240
"Why don't you invite me up, it would be rude not to," said
Fox.

482
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:14,400
"I haven't tidied up yet!" said Cockerel, "Pop back later!"

483
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,200
"I don't mind if your branch is untidy!" said Fox.

484
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,040
Cockerel sighed, "Come on up then," he said slyly.

485
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,480
"Go round to the door at the bottom of the tree and my
porter will let you in!"

486
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:38,160
Fox grinned to himself a sneaky grin…a thread of drool hung
from his chin.

487
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,000
He went to the hollow in the tree…where Dog was waiting
patiently.

488
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:53,840
"Hey, Mr Fox, you wanted to trick me and gobble me up, but I
tricked you instead!" clucked Cockerel.

489
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,880
Fox ran off as fast as he could… and he's never been seen in
that part of the wood again.

490
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,960
"That was an adventure!" Dog yapped.

491
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,360
And home they went to tell the tale of how the Fox's plan
had failed.

492
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:26,640
THE MILLER, HIS SON AND THE DONKEY

493
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:37,720
"Fetch our old donkey," the miller said to his son one day.

494
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,560
"We're taking him to market. We need money and we've nothing
else to sell."

495
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,840
The son ran to the stable where the donkey was kept.

496
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,320
He threw a halter over its neck.

497
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,240
And the donkey wasn't happy!!!

498
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,640
"Grumpy old thing!" said the son, as he led the donkey out
of the stable.

499
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,800
"I'm not sorry we're selling you!"

500
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,120
"I'm not sorry either," brayed the donkey.

501
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,960
"When was the last time you gave me a carrot!"

502
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,800
"We won't ride him," said the miller.

503
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
"It'll be easier to sell him if he's not tired."

504
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,280
They led the donkey down the street towards the town.

505
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,480
"Hey, you," a man shouted suddenly.

506
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,800
"Why don't you ride the donkey?"

507
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,680
"That's what it's for!" another man hollered.

508
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,400
The crowd began to laugh.

509
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,280
The miller hated to be laughed at.

510
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,880
"Get up, son," he said.

511
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,640
The son climbed up on to the donkey's back.

512
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:42,000
"At least it's the smaller one," the donkey grumbled as he
felt the son's weight on his back.

513
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,320
"Something to be grateful for, I suppose."

514
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:52,280
But they hadn't travelled far before they passed three
merchants, whispering and shaking their heads.

515
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,920
"What is the world coming to?" the miller heard one of them
say.

516
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,400
"Get down, young man. Let your master ride the donkey."

517
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,640
The miller thought he'd better do as they said.

518
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,360
"Hop down, lad, and help me up," he said to his son.

519
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,520
So the son climbed down and helped his father clamber up.

520
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,600
"Ee-aw!" grumbled the donkey, as the miller landed on his
back.

521
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,920
"What a lump. Worse than a sack of potatoes."

522
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,160
His back was hard and bony.

523
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,120
The miller wasn't sorry when they reached the gates of the
town.

524
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,960
A group of girls were standing there, bags and baskets in
their hands.

525
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,600
The miller pulled on the donkey's halter.

526
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,280
"Whoa!" he said.

527
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,600
"Let the ladies through first."

528
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:50,040
"Cor, look at that poor boy," one of the girls said, seeing
the son lead the donkey, his father on top.

529
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,840
"His master should let him ride too."

530
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,800
"Lazy thing."

531
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:06,040
The miller was a bit cross, but he liked to please.

532
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,880
"Get up behind me, son," he said.

533
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,000
"What! Both of you at once!" the donkey screeched.

534
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,720
"I'm an old donkey. Ee-aw!"

535
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:26,400
"Look at that poor creature," a woman said as the donkey
crawled slowly along the road, head drooping.

536
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,240
"Two of them on his back."

537
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,720
"And one of them so big!" said her friend.

538
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,000
"They should be carrying it!"

539
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,480
"Yes, they are right," thought the miller, and climbed down.

540
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:49,680
"Get down, son. We'll carry him between us." They tied the
donkey's legs to a pole, the donkey slung between them.

541
00:46:49,680 --> 00:47:10,200
"Now they know what it's like to be a donkey - carrying great loads all day," he thought as the miller and his son
stumbled down the street.

542
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:16,480
The townspeople had never seen such a sight before.

543
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,040
They ran out of their houses to watch.

544
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,640
"Don't they look silly", they laughed.

545
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,880
The donkey hated to be laughed at.

546
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,120
He pushed and he pulled, trying to free himself.

547
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,880
Slowly the ropes that bound him began to loosen.

548
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,160
"One – more – heave," he gasped as they stumbled up to the
bridge.

549
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,720
And with a final tug and a kick he was free.

550
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,200
Over the bridge he tumbled.

551
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,560
Down, down, down he fell.

552
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,960
Splash!

553
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,080
Into the river below.

554
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,280
He thrashed and he brayed.

555
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,480
But there was nothing he could do.

556
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,880
"Ee-aw. Ee-aw," he cried.

557
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,280
Ee— aw!"

558
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,280
The miller watched helplessly as his donkey was swept away.

559
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:09,920
"Silly me," he said as he and his son trudged homewards.

560
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:18,200
"By trying to please everyone I have lost my donkey - and
now I have nothing left to sell."

561
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,600
THE WOLF AND THE HERON

562
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,080
Wolf loved food.

563
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,720
He ate breakfast then he ate two more breakfasts, which took
him up to his midday snack.

564
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:32,680
This was followed by three helpings of lunch, tea, dinner, supper and a midnight feast – with barely a burp between
them.

565
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,680
When Wolf went to bed he stared up at the moon and stars and
wondered what they would taste like.

566
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,440
"Absolutely scrumptious," he decided.

567
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,960
Then Wolf would fall asleep and dream of all the food he'd
eat next day.

568
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:58,760
One morning Wolf found an enormous, glittering fish in the
shallow waters at the edge of the river.

569
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:06,480
So, Wolf gobbled up the fish as quickly as a great woolly
cloud gobbles up the moon.

570
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,840
Wolf was about to pat his stomach when he realized something
was wrong.

571
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:21,120
"Ack eurk ach! There's a bone stuck in my throat!" Wolf spluttered and slapped the back of his neck with his
enormous paws.

572
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:30,640
He coughed, shook his head and waggled his ears but nothing
he did made any difference – the bone was stuck fast.

573
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,600
"I wont be able to eat ever again!" Wolf moaned.

574
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:53,840
"No more food for me - and the bone hurts, it's like having tummy ache and stubbed toes all at once inside my neck!
Please, will someone help me!" and he whined and stumbled frantically along the riverbank.

575
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,880
Then he noticed…

576
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:02,480
"Oh – look at that bird! Look at that beak!" he croaked.

577
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,360
"Are you looking at me?" asked a Heron as the Wolf's
whiskers tickled his wing.

578
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:18,320
"Yes," said Wolf and smiled the best smile he'd ever smiled
so that sunlight went "ting" on his teeth.

579
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:30,920
"I was just thinking what a beautiful bird you are and how pointy and useful that beak of yours is. I wonder if you
could help me?"

580
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,960
"Go on," said the Heron, "I am rather handsome."

581
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:55,040
"Well, Heron, there's a bone stuck in my throat and it hurts. Worse than that, I can't eat because of it." And
Wolf's stomach rumbled so loudly a nearby family of ducks thought it was thunder and hurried into the rushes.

582
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,200
Wolf lifted up his paw and whined.

583
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:05,760
"Please, wonderful Heron, kind Heron, use your beak to get
it out."

584
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:13,600
"Um, well, to tell you the truth, Wolf, I am having a little
rest right now," said the Heron.

585
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:21,720
"Listen, Heron, my friend, I'll give you a present if you
remove the bone - as a reward."

586
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,000
"Sounds good to me," said the Heron.

587
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,680
"I can always have a rest later. Open your mouth as wide as
you can and I'll have a look."

588
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:41,600
"Ahhhh," went the Wolf and in went the Heron's head, sliding
carefully between the rows of sharp teeth.

589
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:49,120
It was dark in the Wolf's throat but Heron found the bone
and tapped and tweaked and tugged.

590
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:58,280
"Got it!" Heron said, gently drawing out the bone and
setting it down beside the Wolf.

591
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,400
"Now, what about my reward?"

592
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,920
Wolf grinned an unpleasant grin that showed all his teeth.

593
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:14,680
"See these?" Wolf said, tapping a tune on them with the tip
of a long pointed claw.

594
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:27,240
"Yes, I had a good look at them a moment ago when my head
was in your mouth," said the trusting Heron.

595
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:33,640
"Well, snarled Wolf, "I didn't bite your head off, did I?"

596
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,520
Heron checked his neck.

597
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,160
"No you didn't," he replied.

598
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:53,520
"Well, that's your reward." And Wolf snapped slinked away to
get his next meal.

599
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,320
THE DONKEY IN THE LION'S SKIN

600
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,800
There was once a foolish donkey who wished he was something
else.

601
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:24,120
"If only I was a giraffe," he would say, "then I could look over the tops of trees...if only I was an elephant then I
could remember where I left things...if only I was a cheetah then I could run like the wind...or fierce as a rhinoceros... ...or cunning as a crocodile... ...or strong as a hippo."

602
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,960
Anything was better than being a donkey.

603
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:32,560
Everyone laughed at donkeys and he didn't like it one little
bit.

604
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:40,360
One day, when he was walking through the forest the donkey
saw something draped over the branch of a tree.

605
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:45,480
When he got closer he could see it was a lion costume.

606
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,000
"I'd look good in that," he thought.

607
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,920
So he put it on.

608
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,800
It covered him from head to foot.

609
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,520
The donkey found a pool and looked at his reflection.

610
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,360
"I look magnificent," he said.

611
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,920
He paraded up and down looking at his reflection from every
angle.

612
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,160
The massive head of the lion covered his donkey's head and
the lion's golden mane flowed round his neck.

613
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,960
"I look like a lion and I feel like a lion," he said.

614
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,280
"No-one will laugh at me now. I am King of the beasts!"

615
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,760
The donkey couldn't wait to show himself to other animals.

616
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,800
He walked up to a giraffe who was eating leaves from the top
of a tall tree.

617
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:42,680
She stopped when she saw the donkey and bent her long legs
in a curtsy.

618
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,280
"Your Majesty," she said, in a fearful voice.

619
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,240
"Greetings, giraffe," said the donkey in a deep, lion-like
voice.

620
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,200
"Won't you join me in a stroll?"

621
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,680
"I can't today," said the giraffe, "I have to get tea for my
children."

622
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,120
And she ran away as quickly as she could.

623
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,400
The donkey smiled to himself.

624
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,360
He saw a hippo in the river.

625
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,000
The hippo bowed his head when he saw the donkey.

626
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,960
"Your Majesty," he said, in hushed tones.

627
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,640
"Greetings hippo," said the donkey.

628
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,240
"Won't you join me in a stroll?"

629
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,840
"I can't today," said the hippo.

630
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,000
"I have to call on a friend who is sick."

631
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,920
And he sank out of sight.

632
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,360
Inside the lion costume the donkey was grinning all over his
face.

633
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,320
He tripped over a crocodile sunbathing on a rock.

634
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:51,480
"Your Majesty!" said the crocodile, smiling with his teeth
on the outside of his lips.

635
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,480
"Greetings crocodile," said the donkey.

636
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,560
"Won't you…"

637
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,200
But the crocodile had slipped into the water and
disappeared.

638
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,880
The donkey was jubilant.

639
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,920
He wanted to leap up and down with delight.

640
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,360
What a marvellous thing it was to be a lion.

641
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,440
A lion was admired and feared by all the other animals.

642
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,080
He felt like a king.

643
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,840
Just then a wily fox came into view.

644
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,200
When he saw the donkey he turned to run.

645
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,920
The donkey could contain his delight no longer.

646
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,280
"I'm a lion," he thought.

647
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:38,680
"I look like a lion, I act like a lion. I feel like a lion.
I BET I EVEN SOUND LIKE A LION."

648
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,600
And the foolish donkey lifted his head and roared.

649
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,760
"Hee-Haw, Hee-Haw, Hee-Haw!"

650
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,640
The fox stopped in his tracks.

651
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,960
He knew that sound.

652
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,240
He grabbed the lion's mane and pulled.

653
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,760
The lion costume came off in his hands.

654
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,960
The donkey stood there, trembling.

655
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,920
The fox began to laugh.

656
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,680
So did the crocodile.

657
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,840
So did the giraffe.

658
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,560
And so did the hippo.

659
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:17,720
"If only I had kept my mouth shut," thought the donkey.

660
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,800
The other animals put their arms round him.

661
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,760
"Don't worry," they said, "we like you just as you are."

662
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:36,520
And they all hurried away before the real lion came along.

663
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:43,680
THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

664
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:52,360
One hot summer's day a Grasshopper sat on a blade of grass
enjoying the sunshine.

665
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,560
"What a fine day," he said.

666
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,560
"The sun's shining and I've got as much grass as I can eat."

667
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,280
The Grasshopper spent the whole morning stuffing his face
until he couldn't eat another thing.

668
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,120
"Right," he said.

669
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,920
"Now I'll make some music."

670
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,280
He rubbed his back legs against his wings and made a loud
buzzing sound.

671
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,000
"Lovely," said the Grasshopper.

672
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,800
"Nothing better than the sound of a happy Grasshopper."

673
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,880
"Give it a rest," said a passing Ant.

674
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,360
"What?" said the Grasshopper.

675
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,160
"I'm trying to work here," said the Ant.

676
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,760
"You're giving me a headache."

677
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,360
"You don't like my music?" said the Grasshopper.

678
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,320
"Not my kind of thing," said the Ant.

679
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:43,400
"Anyway ain't got time to stand around talking about music.
Got stuff to do."

680
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,800
"Stuff?" said the Grasshopper.

681
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,760
"What stuff have you got to do on a lovely sunny morning
like this?"

682
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,080
"Gotta get this food shifted," said the Ant.

683
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:05,960
The Grasshopper noticed that the Ant was dragging along a
huge ear of corn.

684
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:14,000
"That looks like hard work, mate," said the Grasshopper.

685
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,160
"Tell me about it," said the Ant.

686
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,120
"What you doing with it?" said the Grasshopper.

687
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,880
"Taking it to our nest," said the Ant.

688
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,120
"What're you doing that for?"

689
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,200
"Food for the winter," said the Ant.

690
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,680
"Gotta get ready for the winter."

691
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,760
"Why?" said the Grasshopper.

692
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:46,880
"Winter won't come for ages. Won't be winter till...the
winter. It's summer now. Why worry about the winter?"

693
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,560
"We always worry about the winter." said the Ant.

694
00:59:51,560 --> 01:00:01,520
"We spend all summer gathering up food for the winter. It's
what we Ants do."

695
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,760
"It's not what Grasshoppers do," said the Grasshopper.

696
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:19,120
"We Grasshoppers know how to enjoy the summer. Eat...sleep...make some cool music...It's a fine life. We
Grasshoppers know how to live, see."

697
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,800
"Right," said the Ant.

698
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,960
"I'll leave you to it."

699
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,040
"Don't go Ant, mate," said the Grasshopper.

700
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:34,360
"Stick around. Pass the day with me."

701
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,480
"Sorry." said the Ant.

702
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,040
"Like I said, I got stuff to do."

703
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,760
The Ant dragged his ear of corn and struggled off across the
field.

704
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,040
"Please yourself," called the Grasshopper.

705
01:00:50,040 --> 01:01:06,360
"I'm not bothered. I got stuff to do too. Got all this grass to eat. Got the sun to enjoy. Not gonna waste a lovely day
like this talking to Ants."

706
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:12,480
"Have you ever seen a more silly creature than an Ant?"
shouted the grasshopper.

707
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,120
It was winter.

708
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,840
The Grasshopper was cold.

709
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,040
Too cold to hop.

710
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:24,600
Too cold to make his music.

711
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,840
And he was hungry.

712
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,760
He'd spent all day looking for something to eat.

713
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,000
Suddenly he saw the Ant.

714
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,440
"Hello Ant," he shivered.

715
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,280
"Remember me?"

716
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,160
"Yep," said the Ant.

717
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,800
"Cold," isn't it," said the Grasshopper.

718
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,440
"Nice and warm in our nest," said the Ant.

719
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,080
"Not so much to eat now is there," said the Grasshopper

720
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:53,440
"We've got plenty," said the Ant. "Our store rooms are full
of seeds and corn.

721
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,920
Got loads of food.

722
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,440
Enough to see us safely through to Spring."

723
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,440
"Loads of food, eh?" said the Grasshopper.

724
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:24,840
"Look...mate...I don't suppose I could...? I don't suppose
you'd be able to give me...?"

725
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,280
"You said you'd never seen a more silly creature than an
Ant," said the Ant.

726
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,840
"I didn't mean that," said the Grasshopper.

727
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:41,880
"That was just a joke. Oh come on. Just a couple of ears of
corn. You can spare it. I've got nothing."

728
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,640
"Sorry...mate," said the Ant.

729
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:49,400
"If you save up on the days when you have plenty then
there'll never be a day when you have nothing."

730
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,800
The Ant hurried down into his warm nest knowing that he'd
never ever see that Grasshopper again.

731
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,760
THE VAIN AND THE GRASSHOPPER

732
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:09,480
One day a king was sitting in his garden watching a pair of
peacocks walking proudly across the lawn.

733
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,680
"See how beautiful those birds are," he said to the Queen.

734
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:21,160
"Our peacocks with their blue and green feathers and long
shiny tails are the most beautiful birds in the whole
world."

735
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,440
Just then a swan flew over the garden and landed gracefully
on the King's lake.

736
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,560
"No," said the Queen.

737
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:38,280
"I think the swan with its long neck and silky white wings
is the most beautiful bird in the world."

738
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,480
"Peacock!" said the King

739
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,200
"Wrong" said the Queen.

740
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,600
"Swan!"

741
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:53,200
The King didn't like being told he was wrong so he decided
to hold a competition.

742
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:04,000
All the birds were ordered to come to the palace garden on
Saturday afternoon.

743
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,160
There the King and Queen and their friends would decide
which one was the most beautiful.

744
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,200
"There's no point," said the Queen.

745
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,000
"The swan is bound to win."

746
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:24,440
"Peacock!" said the King as he sent out his orders.

747
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:37,440
The birds were very excited when they heard about the competition and there was much polishing of beaks and
combing of feathers as they all made themselves look beautiful for the great competition.

748
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,920
All that is except for the jackdaws.

749
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,000
"No point," said the Chief Jackdaw.

750
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:51,480
"We're not going to win this. Everyone knows that we
jackdaws aren't beautiful."

751
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,040
"I'm not bad looking," said a young jackdaw.

752
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,320
"I might be in with a chance."

753
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:06,480
"Don't make me laugh. Look at yourself. Your feathers are all grey and black, your beak's too long for your head and
you look like you haven't had a bath in a month.

754
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:22,600
You're a scruffy little jackdaw like us. We're clever and cunning and cheeky but none of us is ever going to win a
beauty competition."

755
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,520
The young Jackdaw was upset.

756
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,160
"Right," he said.

757
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,560
"I'll show "em."

758
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:47,000
Next day the young jackdaw flew to the King's garden where he found two long green and blue peacock feathers lying in
the grass.

759
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,640
He picked them up in his beak and carried them back to his
nest.

760
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:58,720
Then, down by the King's lake, he found three beautiful
white swan's feathers and carried them off too.

761
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:07,480
Soon he had lots of brightly coloured feathers from all
sorts of birds and he started to work.

762
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:15,840
First he stuck bright red and green parrot feathers onto his
wings.

763
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,640
Then on his tail he tied the beautiful long peacock
feathers.

764
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:35,520
For his head he made a hat from the silky white feathers of the swan and when his outfit was finished he looked at
himself and said, "Who's scruffy now?"

765
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:41,000
On the day of the competition the King and Queen and their
friends sat in the garden as the birds paraded past.

766
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:49,280
Last to appear was a strange brightly-coloured bird that
no-one had ever seen before.

767
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,880
"What on earth is that?" said the King

768
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,120
"I don't know," said the Queen, "I've never seen anything
like it before but it's very very beautiful."

769
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,240
"Yes it is," said the King.

770
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:07,960
"Yes I am," said the young jackdaw walking up and down in
front of the crowd and showing off his fine colours.

771
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,160
There was no doubt about it.

772
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,240
The King announced that this new bird was the winner.

773
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:34,800
The peacock and the swan both looked very cross as the young
jackdaw bowed to the cheering crowd.

774
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,440
Then something terrible happened.

775
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,200
His hat fell off.

776
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,320
"Just a minute," said the swan.

777
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,920
"Aren't those my feathers?"

778
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,480
"And those wings," said the parrot looking closely at the
jackdaw.

779
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:53,280
"Didn't they used to belong to me?"

780
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,280
"And that tail," said the peacock.

781
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,360
"I'd know that tail anywhere."

782
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:11,680
Soon the young jackdaw was surrounded by birds pecking at
his beautiful costume.

783
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,880
They pulled away their lovely coloured feathers until his
costume had all gone.

784
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,720
"It's just a jackdaw," said the King.

785
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:29,440
"A scruffy little jackdaw," said the Queen.

786
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,000
The young jackdaw walked back to his nest very slowly.

787
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:39,880
"I just wanted to be special," he said.

788
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:49,480
"You don't become special just by putting on fine clothes,"
said the Chief Jackdaw.

789
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,800
"I know that. I know that now," said the young jackdaw.

790
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,280
But the other jackdaws weren't listening to him.

791
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,640
They'd already flown away and left him all alone.

792
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,240
THE FROGS WHO WANTED A KING

793
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:11,720
The Frogs should have been happy.

794
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:22,080
It was summer, they had plenty to eat and nothing much to do
except mess about in the cool clear water of their pool.

795
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,600
They should have been very happy indeed...but they weren't.

796
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:33,120
"Being a frog's a bit boring actually," said a frog.

797
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:40,800
"Yeah. It's just eating and swimming basically," said
another.

798
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:47,600
"What's the point? Why are we here? Why can't life be more
exciting?"

799
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,520
"If only we had a leader," said a fat bullfrog.

800
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:58,680
"If we had a leader he'd tell us what to do."

801
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,280
"That's right," said another Frog.

802
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:14,200
"If we had a leader he'd organise... parties and...plays
and... picnics and errr...

803
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:23,040
"Of course what we really need... ...in an ideal world,"
said the bullfrog, "is a King."

804
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,920
The frogs all gasped.

805
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,920
A king!

806
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,240
Imagine!

807
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:32,000
Their very own king with a crown on his head, giving orders
and telling them all what to do.

808
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,960
"So how do we get a king?" said the little frog.

809
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:44,840
"To get a King," said the bullfrog, "you need to go to the
top."

810
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,520
The Frogs knew what the bullfrog meant.

811
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,640
The king of all the gods was called Jupiter.

812
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,560
If you needed to go to the top you couldn't go any higher
than Jupiter.

813
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,080
Later that afternoon the frogs watched as the bullfrog then
climbed up onto a rock and cleared his throat.

814
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,960
"Excuse me," he shouted in his loudest voice.

815
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:11,120
"Excuse me, Jupiter... ...we were wondering if we could have
a King? Please," said the bullfrog.

816
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:25,360
Jupiter was very busy and didn't want to be bothered but he knew that if he didn't give those frogs something they'd
keep croaking on and on and on...so he said:

817
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:34,320
"Alright! Enough! You want a King? Well have this one!"

818
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,960
Into the pond fell a huge log of wood.

819
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,800
"Wow!" said the little frog.

820
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,800
"Look how big our King is!"

821
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,120
"He's enormous," said the bullfrog.

822
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:59,400
All day the frogs swam around their enormous King and waited
for him to speak but the new King didn't say a word.

823
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:14,800
"He's a bit quiet in't he?" said the little frog "...for a
King."

824
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,880
"Yeah," they all agreed.

825
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,760
"He's a bit quiet."

826
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,240
Days went past and the new king never said a word.

827
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:32,520
In fact he didn't even move and after a while the frogs stopped thinking of him as a king and started using him as a
diving platform and sunbathing area.

828
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:39,440
"I don't think this King is much good to be honest," said
one of the younger frogs.

829
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,400
"Yes," said somebody else.

830
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:49,240
"Tell Jupiter that frogs deserve a proper king who'll move
about and be powerful and strong and frightening and..."

831
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:53,840
Now Jupiter was listening to all this and these noisy
ungrateful frogs were making him very angry indeed.

832
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,680
He lifted his right hand.

833
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:00,600
"You want a frightening king do you frogs?" he said.

834
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,120
"Well try this one for size."

835
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:09,800
From out of the sky came a huge white stork, the biggest
bird they'd ever seen.

836
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,480
The frogs ran in terror as the stork started gobbling them
up in his huge beak.

837
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,360
"Please, Lord Jupiter," said the bullfrog.

838
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,560
"Save us. Take away this terrible King."

839
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,560
"Do you see now?" said Jupiter.

840
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,120
"Better to have no king at all than a cruel one. "

841
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,320
But the frogs weren't listening... ...they'd all
disappeared.

842
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,080
THE CAT AND THE MICE

843
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,240
On the kitchen table was a smelly cheese.

844
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,560
The smell wafted through the kitchen.

845
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,200
The smell spiralled down the hole in the skirting board.

846
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,200
The smell drifted into the noses of three little mice.

847
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,080
"I love ch...ch...cheese!" whined Mini-Mouse, hungrily.

848
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,400
"So do I!" squeaked Mildred-Mouse.

849
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:55,600
Mighty-Mouse narrowed his eyes, "Mission required to steal
cheese!" he said.

850
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,840
In the kitchen lived a cat.

851
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:03,080
"I'm a Terrible-Tiger-Cat!" said the cat, prowling across
the floor.

852
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:10,640
And this Terrible-Tiger-Cat had the important job of
guarding the cheese from pesky mice.

853
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,640
Under the skirting boards, the smell of cheese was too much
for the mice.

854
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,320
"Right!" said Mighty-Mouse.

855
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:29,680
"Right," said Mighty-Mouse, "Mini-Mouse you go on my right side, Mildred-Mouse goes on my left and we'll rush out,
steal the cheese and get back quick. OK?"

856
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,160
"What makes you think this plan will work?" said
Mildred-Mouse.

857
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:38,040
"Trust me!" said Mighty-Mouse confidently.

858
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,920
"We have the element of surprise! Let's GO!"

859
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,880
Under the kitchen table sat the Terrible-Tiger-Cat.

860
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:52,920
He watched as three little mice shot out of the hole in the
skirting board.

861
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,920
"Mice? I'll catch "em!

862
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,360
I'll snatch "em!"

863
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,640
The Terrible-Tiger-Cat opened his terrible mouth and showed
his terrible teeth.

864
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,600
"Wait for me!" yelled Mighty-Mouse.

865
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,760
In the hole under the skirting boards, three little mice
panted for breath.

866
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,440
"N...n...now what?" asked Mini-Mouse.

867
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,560
"NOW," said Mildred-Mouse, with grim determination.

868
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,160
"We forget the cheese! We don't need it!"

869
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,920
And she marched off, leaving Mighty-Mouse looking
embarrassed.

870
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,360
In the kitchen, the Terrible-Tiger-Cat waited.

871
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,400
There was no sign of mice.

872
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,560
The Terrible-Tiger-Cat was bored.

873
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,640
"Mice? I'll catch "em!

874
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:39,480
I'll snatch "em!...if I can thee "em!

875
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:52,840
"Humm… maybe if I wasn't here, the mice would come out!
Maybe, if I pretend to not be here…"

876
01:15:52,840 --> 01:16:00,080
Terrible-Tiger-Cat looked up at a sack that hung from the
wall.

877
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:00,680
The sack was grey.

878
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,760
Terrible-Tiger-Cat looked at his fur.

879
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,960
His fur was grey also.

880
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,480
"Now," he said thoughtfully.

881
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:23,960
"If I take this sack down from the wall… and if I climb up and hang myself there instead…I would look like a sack and
not like a cat! Clever, eh?"

882
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:29,800
So Terrible-Tiger-Cat hung himself from the wall and waited.

883
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,160
Down the hole Mini-Mouse groaned.

884
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:40,640
"The smell of ch...cheese is killing me! If I could have one
taste…"

885
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:48,080
"Get back here!" said Mildred, grabbing Mini-Mouse's tail
and pulling him back.

886
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,680
"B...b...but NO CAT!" said Mini-Mouse excitedly.

887
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,320
"Humm," said Mildred.

888
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,840
"NEVER trust a cat!"

889
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,680
She poked her snout out cautiously.

890
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,280
Mildred looked up at the sack hanging on the wall.

891
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,240
The sack with the two bright eyes.

892
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,640
"No cat?" Mildred smiled wryly.

893
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,400
"THEN WHAT'S THAT HANGING ON THE WALL?"

894
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:29,520
And the Terrible-Tiger-Cat replied, "Waaaoow! I'm only an
old sack!"

895
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,840
"C...c...cat!" stuttered Mini-Mouse.

896
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:39,080
"Abandon plan!" said Mighty-Mouse.

897
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,680
"Come on!" laughed Mildred, "Let's get back to the
mousehole."

898
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,800
And there was silence in the kitchen.

899
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,800
"Ooopth!" said the Terrible-Tiger-Cat.

900
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,280
"I wonder what gave me away?"

901
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,600
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

902
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:01,720
A Mouse was scurrying through the forest when he saw a Lion
sleeping under a tree.

903
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,120
The Mouse stopped and said to the Lion.

904
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,720
"You may be very big but I'm not scared of you."

905
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:14,600
The Mouse climbed up the Lion's tail and sat down on its
back leg.

906
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:22,920
"Oh no, Mr Lion, you don't frighten me one little bit."

907
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:31,200
Still the Lion didn't move so the Mouse walked along the
Lion's side and climbed up towards his head.

908
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:39,240
"All the animals in the forest are scared of you, Mr Lion, but not us mice "cos mice are the bravest creatures in the
world."

909
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:49,120
Again the Lion didn't move so the mouse climbed up the lions
face and shouted in his ear.

910
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:56,240
"Why should we be scared of lazy lions who spend all day
snoring under trees?"

911
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:06,440
The Mouse was enjoying himself and feeling very brave when he noticed that the Lion's eye was open and looking straight
at him.

912
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,960
Quick as a flash the Lion grabbed the little Mouse in his
paw.

913
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,240
"What were you saying?" said the Lion.

914
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,480
"Nothing," said the little Mouse.

915
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,200
"Something about brave mice and lazy lions"

916
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,640
"That wasn't me," said the Mouse.

917
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,560
"I'd never say that. I think lions are..."

918
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,040
"Quiet," said the Lion.

919
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,680
"I'm going to eat you. What do you think about that? "

920
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:41,360
"Don't think that's a good idea," said the Mouse.

921
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,640
"Why's that?" said the Lion.

922
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,880
"Because..."

923
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,560
"Because what?" said the Lion.

924
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:55,520
"Because..." And suddenly an idea flashed into the Mouse's
tiny head.

925
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,080
"Because one day I could help you."

926
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,440
The Lion roared with laughter.

927
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,720
"You? How could a tiny Mouse help a huge Lion like me..?"

928
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,720
"I don't know," said the Mouse.

929
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,840
"Maybe I could..."

930
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,240
"Yes?" said the Lion.

931
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,000
"Maybe I could..."

932
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,960
"Yes?"

933
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:17,600
The Mouse couldn't think of a single way in which a tiny
Mouse could help a Lion.

934
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,760
He shut his eyes and waited to be eaten.

935
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,840
But the Lion didn't eat the Mouse.

936
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,280
He just laughed and gently put the Mouse down on the ground.

937
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,640
"That's the funniest thing I've ever heard," said the Lion.

938
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:52,440
"A tiny Mouse helping a huge Lion like me. I'm not going to eat you after all, little Mouse. You're too funny to eat.
I'm going to let you go."

939
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,280
"Oh, thank you," said the mouse.

940
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:04,720
"I think that's a very wise decision. I meant what I said. I
will help you Mr Lion. One day. Just you wait and see."

941
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:11,280
The Lion laughed again: "Off you go little one," he roared,
"before I die laughing."

942
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,000
The Mouse ran away feeling very lucky.

943
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:22,720
But the very next day he was scurrying through the forest
when he heard more roaring.

944
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:30,760
This time though, it wasn't a roar of laughter but a roar of
pain and fear.

945
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:38,320
The Mouse crept closer to the terrible sound and saw the
same Lion all tangled up in a hunter's net.

946
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:44,560
The more he struggled the more tangled up he became.

947
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:54,800
He was just about to run away when the Mouse remembered how
the Lion could have eaten him but let him go.

948
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,160
And then the Mouse remembered saying:

949
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:02,280
"I will help you, Mr Lion. One day. Just you wait and see."

950
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,560
Suddenly the Mouse was chewing at the ropes and gnawing as
fast as he could.

951
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:15,600
His teeth were tiny but razor sharp and soon he had cut the
ropes and the Lion was free.

952
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,640
The Mouse looked at the Lion.

953
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,880
The Lion looked at the Mouse.

954
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:44,160
"Yesterday I laughed when you said you would help me. I'm not laughing now. You are a very brave little Mouse. Just
goes to show you don't have to be big to be a big friend. Thank you."

955
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:51,920
"That's alright," said the Mouse.

956
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,640
"You get into trouble again just give me a shout, OK?"

957
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,720
"OK," said the Lion and he turned and walked away.

958
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,480
The Mouse watched him go.

959
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,320
He smiled to himself and now somehow he didn't feel quite so
little.

960
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,040
THE CAGED BIRD AND THE BAT

961
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:15,720
In a village far, far away there once lived a pretty little
songbird.

962
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,400
She was in fact a very grumpy, bad-tempered little songbird.

963
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:34,120
You see, she'd been caught and trapped by a young woodsman named Fergus Fowler and he had locked her in a cage outside
his cottage window.

964
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:48,320
So there she sat looking out through the bars, longing to be
free, mumbling and grumbling all through the day.

965
01:23:48,320 --> 01:24:04,800
"That nasty, horrible, grubby little good for nothing…with his muddy knees and dirty feet and his hooks and his nets
and his traps…going about catching us happy folk…"

966
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,520
But oh when she sang!

967
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,400
You've never heard such a beautiful sound.

968
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:16,160
She would sing of the fields and the flowers, of the wind
ruffling her feathers and the sun warming her wings.

969
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:21,840
She would sing of the sound of waterfalls and cool mountain
streams tinkling and splashing over pebbles.

970
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:27,400
It was a magical song that you wished to hear from the first
light of dawn till last thing at night…

971
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,720
But that is something our little songbird…never…ever…did.

972
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:39,560
Not a peep, not a whistle, not a single twitter tweet would
she utter during daytime hours.

973
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,760
"I have my reasons," said the songbird smugly to herself.

974
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,360
"Oh no…no I'll not do that again…I've learned that sure
enough."

975
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,880
Now Fergus Fowler wasn't such a bad young lad.

976
01:24:48,880 --> 01:25:00,520
He was a kind, sensitive boy and he was a really terrible hunter and if he did by some extraordinary good luck
actually catch a guinea-fowl or field mouse he always set it free.

977
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,640
He couldn't bear to see it suffer.

978
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:11,640
The only creature that Fergus Fowler had ever actually
trapped and kept and loved very much was the songbird.

979
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:18,760
"What a wonderful song," he said… "Now you can sing for me every day!" But the little songbird hadn't sung from that
day to this.

980
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:38,280
"I might be a useless hunter," Fergus mumbled to the little bird, feeding her some of his bread, "but you're a bit of a
useless songbird too. You're very sweet and pretty, but you never, EVER sing!"

981
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:52,680
Which was true as far as he knew because it was only when the moon was up and the owls awake, when Fergus Fowler was
sound asleep in his bed that the little songbird opened her tiny beak…and sang.

982
01:25:52,680 --> 01:26:03,760
She would sing her beautiful tunes all through the long
night hours while Fergus snored inside.

983
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:14,520
But each day at dawn, as the sun rose over the meadows, the
little songbird would fall silent and pretend to be asleep.

984
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:22,880
Late that night, while Fergus was sound asleep, the little
songbird began her song.

985
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:31,120
A tiny bat flew past and hearing the beautiful sound he
clung to the bars of the cage and asked:

986
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:43,760
"Little songbird, you sing such lovely songs, but why do you only sing at night and never during the day like all the
other birds in the forest?"

987
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,360
"Oh I have a clever plan," tweeted the bird.

988
01:26:48,360 --> 01:27:00,000
"You see, the last time I sang during the day a trapper caught me in his nets and locked me in this cage. So I'll
not make that mistake again!"

989
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:12,280
But the Bat replied, "Well it's no use your doing that now when you're a prisoner. If only you'd done that before you
were caught, you might still have been free."

990
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:16,240
And the cheeky bat flew off into the night.

991
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,840
THE FOX AND THE GOAT

992
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:35,160
One day a rather clever Fox went out for a stroll.

993
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:46,840
The sun was shining, clouds bumped along in the sky and - well, better than that the great cloud shadows raced across
the fields.

994
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:52,080
"Whoo hooo!" barked the Fox as he chased after them.

995
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,880
"What fun! It's a very good day to be a Fox."

996
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,520
The not-quite-looking-where-he-was-going Fox laughed and -
whoops!

997
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,560
Splish!

998
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,720
Splosh!

999
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,200
Fox fell into a well that he just hadn't noticed.

1000
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:20,400
"That's all right! I'll jump back out again. Look at me, I can leap over hedges and fences and sleeping dogs! I'm the
best jumper there ever was!" said the rather hopeful Fox.

1001
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,560
However, the walls of the well were much too high.

1002
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,960
They were also slippery with moss.

1003
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:34,600
So, a rather soggy Fox doggy-paddled to and fro and tried to
come up with another plan.

1004
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:44,120
After he had swum one hundred times around the well, and
back again, the rather tired Fox had to admit he was
trapped.

1005
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,560
"I never thought I'd end up down here," he sighed.

1006
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:59,680
"No more racing in the sunlight and chasing shadows for me!" And a rather sad Fox floated quietly in a patch of water
that reflected the sky.

1007
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,240
Just then a goat's head appeared over the edge of the well.

1008
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,920
"Hello," she bleated.

1009
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:12,320
"I thought I heard a voice. What are you doing?"

1010
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,360
"Hello," said the rather quick-thinking Fox.

1011
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:32,680
"Actually, I'm having a wonderful time. This is the best water in the whole wide world. Drinking it makes you happy,
paddling in it makes you healthy and it tastes delicious! It's wonderful!"

1012
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,920
Fox smiled and dipped his face into the water and blew
bubbles.

1013
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,360
Then drank and drank and drank.

1014
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:51,840
"Oh, where are my manners," Fox said as the Goat leaned down, stretched her neck, stuck out her tongue and tried her
hardest to reach the water.

1015
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,120
"Would you like some?"

1016
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,440
"Yes, please," said the Goat.

1017
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:03,640
"Well jump straight in and help yourself. I'll move over
here so there's room for two."

1018
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,320
"I am very thirsty," said the Goat.

1019
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,440
"I've just eaten thistles!" And in she leapt.

1020
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:19,680
"Slurp, gargle, gulp," went the goat.

1021
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:36,440
"This water is perfect – cool and sweet and delicious. Thank
you for letting me share it. Now I'll be off, there are lots of thistles waiting to be munched." Then the Goat looked up and frowned.

1022
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:42,680
"Excuse me for asking, Fox, but how do we get out of here?"

1023
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:48,480
The Fox pretended to think about it for a minute, then
clicked his paws.

1024
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:59,160
"I know, lean up against the side of the well and I'll climb
up your back, onto your shoulders then step on your head and I'll be out."

1025
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:08,200
"Ohhhh what a good idea! You are clever," said the goat, standing on her hind legs and leaning against the mossy well
wall.

1026
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,560
"There you are, my friend – a goat ladder!"

1027
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:17,080
"Upsadaisy!" the Fox giggled as he scrambled out of the
well.

1028
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,880
Then he shook his coat.

1029
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,080
Water flew off him and the warm sunlight made his fur steam.

1030
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:30,880
"Hello sky!" he cried and chased his tail before running off
across the wide, green field.

1031
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,440
"Hello?" bleated the Goat.

1032
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:39,000
"What about me? How do I get out?"

1033
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:45,760
Fox shouted back over his shoulder, "You should have thought
about that before you jumped in!"

1034
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,760
"Wait!" wailed the goat.

1035
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:57,920
"It was good to see you but I wouldn't want to be you!" the rather clever Fox sang, as he followed a cloud shadow over
the hill.

1036
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,160
THE LION AND THE ELEPHANT

1037
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:15,160
It was nearly morning and the Lion had just gone to bed.

1038
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:20,200
He pulled the grass duvet over his head and closed his eyes.

1039
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:25,640
He was just about to fall asleep when a noise sounded across
the plain.

1040
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,960
"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!"

1041
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,360
It was the Cockerel crowing.

1042
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,000
"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!"

1043
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,840
The Lion put his paws over his ears.

1044
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,920
"Go away," he cried, "go away!"

1045
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,720
But the Cockerel didn't want to go away.

1046
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:46,080
He wanted to tell the world what a beautiful morning it was.

1047
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,920
The Lion kept his head under the duvet.

1048
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,680
"That noise is driving me mad," he said.

1049
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,920
It was the same every morning.

1050
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,440
The sun came up and the Cockerel crowed.

1051
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,880
And each time he heard it the Lion hated it more.

1052
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,680
It made him feel afraid.

1053
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:15,080
"Why is it," he asked himself, "that someone like me, who is brave and strong and fearless should be afraid of the sound
of a harmless cockerel?"

1054
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,400
He decided to talk to the other animals.

1055
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:24,880
"Monkeys," he asked, "does the sound of the Cockerel make
you feel afraid?"

1056
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,840
"No," said the monkeys together.

1057
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:34,040
"We're not afraid of anything."

1058
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:41,960
"Hippopotamus," asked the Lion, "you are big and strong like
me. Is there anything that frightens you?"

1059
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,480
The hippopotamus was bathing in the river.

1060
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:50,080
He blew a stream of bubbles out of his nose.

1061
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,960
"Nothing frightens me," he said.

1062
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,760
"Not even the sound of a cockerel crowing."

1063
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,360
"Especially not the sound of a cockerel crowing."

1064
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,080
Ashamed of his weakness the Lion turned away.

1065
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:08,080
A crocodile was sunbathing near by.

1066
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:14,440
"Are you afraid of anything, Crocodile?" the Lion asked.

1067
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,800
The crocodile thought for a moment.

1068
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,680
"Jam sandwiches!" he answered.

1069
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:32,600
The Lion thought this was a strange thing for the crocodile
to be afraid about, but he didn't argue.

1070
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,760
Just then an elephant lumbered out of the forest.

1071
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:45,120
"If anyone can answer my question, he can," thought the
Lion.

1072
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,480
"Elephant, can I speak to you?" he asked.

1073
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:55,000
"Not today, Lion," said the Elephant, shaking his head.

1074
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,120
"I have a problem."

1075
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:03,240
"Is it a serious problem?" asked the Lion.

1076
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,440
"It is to me," said the Elephant.

1077
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:14,760
And he shook his head so hard the Lion thought the
elephant's ears would come off.

1078
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:19,200
"I've got a serious problem too," said the Lion.

1079
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:28,600
"Well, you tell me your serious problem and I'll tell you
mine," said the Elephant.

1080
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:36,240
So the Lion told the Elephant all about how afraid he was of
the crowing of the cock.

1081
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:41,840
"I sympathise with you, Lion," said the Elephant.

1082
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,200
And he gave his head another massive shake.

1083
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:49,200
"Do you see a small insect buzzing around?" he continued.

1084
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:54,960
The Lion could just make out a gnat near the Elephant's
head.

1085
01:35:55,160 --> 01:36:04,080
"If that insect flies inside my ears," continued the
Elephant, "I am positive I am done for."

1086
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,440
"You mean you are afraid of a tiny gnat?" queried the Lion.

1087
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,760
"Yes," said the Elephant.

1088
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,640
The Lion thought about this for a minute.

1089
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:28,000
It was hard to believe that such a strong, wise and clever
animal could be afraid of so small a thing.

1090
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Now the Lion felt sorry for the Elephant.

1091
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:45,080
"Your fear is worse than mine," he told him.

1092
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:50,160
"I am sorry now I troubled you at all."

1093
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:53,200
"I'm glad you did," said the Elephant.

1094
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:57,920
The next morning when the Cock crowed the Lion turned over
in bed and went back to sleep.

1095
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,600
"It's just a noise," he told himself, "it can't possibly
hurt me."

1096
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,400
And he was right.

1097
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,200
THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

1098
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:14,200
This is the story of a pitcher and a crow, and a pitcher is
a jug, in case you didn't know.

1099
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:21,080
Old Mr Crow was a big black bird with a big black beak and
he lived at the top of a tree.

1100
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,000
He was a clever old creature.

1101
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:32,120
"There's no problem you can't fix if you only take the time
to think about it!" he would say.

1102
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:43,280
And over the years, Old Mr Crow had managed to solve lots of
problems…just through taking the time to settle his feathers and think.

1103
01:37:43,280 --> 01:38:01,360
When he wanted to feast on a juicy clam that was hiding inside its tightly shut shell, Mr Crow solved the problem by
dropping the shell from a great height so it hit the ground and burst open.

1104
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:07,640
"This clam sure tastes delicious!" he cawed.

1105
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:15,280
"Go, go Mr Crow, you're the smartest bird we know!" chirped
the Sparrow Sisters.

1106
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:24,120
Walnuts were even trickier for a crow to crack open, but Mr
Crow solved that problem too.

1107
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:28,080
"I'll let the cars that drive by do the work for me," he
cawed.

1108
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:33,080
Then he plucked a walnut from the tree and dropped it in the
road, just by the crossing.

1109
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,280
A car drove over it and cracked the walnut open.

1110
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:43,880
When the traffic lights turned red and the traffic stopped
Mr Crow hopped into the road and pecked up the tasty nut.

1111
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:52,200
"Go, go Mr Crow, you're so clever don't you know!" chirped
the Sparrow Sisters.

1112
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:58,960
Then one day Mr Crow came across a problem he thought he
couldn't solve.

1113
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:07,440
The weather had been hot and dry for weeks and all the water
had dried up in the pond.

1114
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,640
Mr Crow was very thirsty.

1115
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:20,440
He flew for miles looking for water but wherever he went the
streams and ponds were dry.

1116
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:25,840
Then, as he was flying by a farm house, he noticed a pitcher
in the garden.

1117
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,920
"Maybe that pitcher will have water in it," he thought.

1118
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,520
So he flew down to look.

1119
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:37,200
There was a little bit of water at the bottom, not much, but
enough for a crow.

1120
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:45,480
Mr Crow put his beak in eagerly…but the pitcher was tall and
the water was shallow and his beak couldn't reach.

1121
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,480
"I can see the water, but I can't drink it!" he said to
himself.

1122
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:54,280
"And without the water I will die of thirst. This is a
problem!"

1123
01:39:54,280 --> 01:40:08,240
Mr Crow settled his feathers and thought for a while…and as he was thinking, his black beady eyes spotted a small
stone…"Hmm," he thought, "I wonder if that stone can help me solve my problem?"

1124
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:17,000
Then he had an idea…he picked the stone up in his beak and he dropped it in the pitcher…this made the water in the
pitcher rise, just a little.

1125
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,800
"I need more stones," thought Mr Crow.

1126
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:27,560
He flew around the yard searching for stones and, one by
one, he dropped them into the pitcher.

1127
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:34,120
Each time the water rose a little but each time he dipped
his beak in but it wouldn't reach the water.

1128
01:40:34,120 --> 01:41:08,960
Mr Crow worked all day…flying backwards and forwards picking
up stones and dropping them in… then at last, as the sun was setting, he looked into the pitcher and saw that he had almost filled it with stones.

1129
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,440
Now the water had risen high enough for his beak to reach.

1130
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:17,040
"Go, go Mr Crow, you're so clever don't you know!" chirped
the Sparrow Sisters

1131
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:29,480
"A problem's not a problem if you take the time to think,"
said Old Mr Crow as he settled down to drink.

1132
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,560
THE FOX AND THE STORK

1133
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:38,200
A rather large bird was wandering round the wood, looking a
bit lost.

1134
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:47,400
It had long legs, a long thin neck and a very long bill for eating, that clattered away as it searched for nice things
to eat.

1135
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:53,600
"Hey there, big bird!" cried the little birds in the trees
above.

1136
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:57,400
"You're new round these parts, aren't you?"

1137
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,560
"Indeed I am," replied Stork.

1138
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:02,240
"And I'd like to make some friends."

1139
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:09,200
"I'll be your friend," purred a soft voice from behind a
bush.

1140
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:13,760
Out slunk Fox with his shiny red coat and soft paws.

1141
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:21,240
"Oooo, we wouldn't make friends with old Foxy if we were
you," chorused the birds.

1142
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,520
"He's a bit of a joker."

1143
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,600
"Oh, ignore them", Fox purred reassuringly.

1144
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:34,600
"Please, allow me to show you round the woods…"

1145
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:40,680
Fox and Stork were soon laughing and chatting as if they'd
known each other forever…

1146
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:46,000
"What do you like to eat, Stork?" asked Fox.

1147
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:51,520
"Frogs, fish, insects and earthworms are my favourites,"
replied Stork.

1148
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:57,640
"Mine too – oh, leaving aside frogs," said Fox.

1149
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:04,400
"I eat nuts and berries too – and I'm very partial to the
occasional little bird."

1150
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:10,480
"Boo, hiss!" cried the birds from above.

1151
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:16,360
"Only joking," said Fox rather too quickly.

1152
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:22,200
"Would you like to come around my house tomorrow for supper,
Stork?"

1153
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:26,160
"It's a trick, it's a trick!" chorused the birds.

1154
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,680
"Thank you, Fox, I'd love to!"

1155
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:33,280
That night, Stork flew over to Fox's house.

1156
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:39,480
"Come in!" cried Fox as he showed Stork into the dining
room.

1157
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:44,120
"I hope you like fish soup with mashed earthworms."

1158
01:43:44,120 --> 01:44:00,200
Stork was expecting to see two bowls full of lovely steaming soup – but instead, two flat plates covered in a thin layer
of liquid lay on the table.

1159
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:10,880
Stork tried her hardest to eat the soup with her bill, but
it was impossible.

1160
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:15,160
Fox meanwhile was already licking his bowl clean.

1161
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,360
"Oh, dear, is there a problem?" he asked with a smirk.

1162
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,280
"Not at all," replied Stork.

1163
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:31,040
"It's just – well, I had rather a large tea before I came
and my tummy's full."

1164
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:35,520
"Tea – I like the sound of that," purred Fox.

1165
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:42,360
"Well, why don't you come to my home tomorrow and join me?"
suggested Stork.

1166
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:52,160
"I shall look forward to it," replied Fox.

1167
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,320
Stork flew home that night with a heavy heart.

1168
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:59,080
"We warned you, we warned you!" chorused the birds.

1169
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:04,560
"I know, my so-called friend tricked me," replied Stork.

1170
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,520
"But I may yet have the last laugh."

1171
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:13,160
The next day, Fox set off for Stork's house.

1172
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:18,440
"Shame on you!" cried the birds as he slunk under their
tree.

1173
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,920
"Stork can take a joke," Fox replied.

1174
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:26,960
"And after all, she's invited me over for tea."

1175
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,720
"Hee, hee!" sniggered the birds.

1176
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,520
"Come in!" said Stork to Fox.

1177
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:36,800
"I've cooked roast rabbit on a bed of grass with berry and
nut sauce.

1178
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:43,240
"Mmm, my favourite," said Fox as Stork carried in a tray.

1179
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:52,800
He stared at the tall jar Stork had placed in front of him.
It was long and thin and the food lay right at the bottom.

1180
01:45:52,840 --> 01:46:08,040
Fox watched in frustration as Stork stuck her long bill into her jar and gobbled up the meal. "Oh dear," said Stork. "Is
there a problem?"

1181
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,840
"None at all," growled Fox.

1182
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:18,360
He stuck his nose as far down the jar as he could, but he
still couldn't reach his dinner.

1183
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,920
And now there really was a problem.

1184
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:46,280
"Yowl! The jar's stuck to my face!" came Fox's muffled
cries.

1185
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:52,560
"Hee hee! Serves you right, Foxy," chorused the birds who
were watching on the window sill.

1186
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,400
For once, Fox couldn't answer back.

1187
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:59,320
"I'll pull it off with my wings," offered Stork kindly.

1188
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:05,080
"Hmmm, I guess I deserved that after the joke I played on
you," said Fox sheepishly.

1189
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,800
"Never mind," said Stork.

1190
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:14,320
"I've got plenty of food in the kitchen. This time we'll have it on proper plates – and our little feathered friends
can have some too."

1191
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,280
"Wee, hee!" cried the birds.

1192
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,600
TWO TRAVELLERS AND A BEAR

1193
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,800
One cold winter's day two friends set off to travel to the
town.

1194
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:27,680
They talked and laughed as they strode along.

1195
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:36,920
It was cold and snow was falling but the two men hardly
noticed - they were enjoying each other's company so much.

1196
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:41,480
What a pleasant fellow he is, each of them thought.

1197
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,960
I'm glad that we are travelling together.

1198
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,640
The road to the town lay through a forest.

1199
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,160
It was late by the time the men reached it.

1200
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:55,400
"We should turn back," one of them said to the other
nervously.

1201
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,440
"It'll soon be dark and there are bears in that forest."

1202
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,680
His friend was just as scared as he was.

1203
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:04,400
But didn't want his friend to know.

1204
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,560
So he laughed.

1205
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:14,400
"Pah! Bears. That's nothing to be afraid of. I fought a bear
once – and he ran away."

1206
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:19,160
The other man felt ashamed of himself.

1207
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:25,760
I am a coward, but he is brave, he thought.

1208
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,480
"Then we'll go on," he said.

1209
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:30,360
It was very dark in that forest.

1210
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,080
The trees grew close together.

1211
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,160
It was hard to see the road clearly.

1212
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:35,800
It was hard to see anything at all!

1213
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,280
But the man wasn't afraid any more.

1214
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:44,400
He listened as his friend told him all about his fight with
the bear.

1215
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,360
"It was very big," he boasted.

1216
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:53,880
"Twice as big as me. But I picked up a stick and fought it
off."

1217
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,720
All of a sudden there was an enormous crash.

1218
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:00,240
And out of the bushes lumbered - a bear.

1219
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:03,880
The men had never seen such a huge bear.

1220
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,040
When it saw the men it licked its lips.

1221
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:13,200
"At last!" it said, standing up on its hind legs and
growling.

1222
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,520
"Dinner!"

1223
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:23,480
With a cry of fright, the friend ran to the nearest tree and
hauled himself up onto a branch.

1224
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:28,640
"Aren't you going to fight it?" the man cried.

1225
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,320
"Fight it! You must be mad," said his friend.

1226
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:38,000
"It will kill us." The man ran up to the tree where his
friend crouched, trembling.

1227
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:43,120
"There's room for us both in that tree," he cried.

1228
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:43,720
"Help me up."

1229
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,000
But his friend pushed him away.

1230
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,240
"No there isn't. Find somewhere else to hide," he said.

1231
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,160
"What shall I do?" the man thought.

1232
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:58,560
The bear was so close now he could have stretched out a hand
and touched it.

1233
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:07,520
"If I try to run it will run faster. If I fight it, it will
kill me. It is bigger and stronger than me."

1234
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:14,120
He flung himself to the ground and lay there, as still as he
could.

1235
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:22,720
"Perhaps it will leave me alone," he thought, "if it thinks
I am dead."

1236
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,040
The bear was very hungry.

1237
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:27,040
It hadn't eaten for a long time.

1238
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:32,360
But it was puzzled when it saw the man drop to the ground.

1239
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:34,680
"Is he dead?" it wondered.

1240
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,480
"Let me see."

1241
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:45,280
It bent down, so close that the man could feel its fur brush
his cheek.

1242
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,600
Then it put out a paw and prodded him.

1243
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,480
The man lay still, his heart pounding.

1244
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:57,640
"Any minute now," he thought, "that bear will tear me to
pieces." But the bear got up.

1245
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:01,600
"He hasn't moved. He must be dead," it thought.

1246
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:06,000
"And I don't like dead meat." And it ambled away sadly into
the forest.

1247
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,480
The man got up and dusted himself down.

1248
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:13,480
He didn't look at his friend.

1249
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:21,920
He was very angry with him.

1250
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:37,360
He had pretended to be brave, but he was a coward.

1251
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:40,880
He had left him to face the bear on his own.

1252
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:46,720
"I saw the bear whisper in your ear," the friend said
climbing down from the tree.

1253
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,560
"What did he say?"

1254
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:56,880
"He said a man who leaves his friend to face danger isn't a true friend." And with that he turned away, leaving the
other to make his own way home.

1255
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,800
THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS

1256
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,640
There once was a very poor farmer.

1257
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:12,040
So poor he lived in an old tumble-down pigsty in the middle of nowhere with only acorns and the odd goose egg to eat and
a bale of straw for his bed.

1258
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:14,400
His name was Attacus Greeb.

1259
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,520
Now Attacus Greeb hadn't always been poor.

1260
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:26,840
He'd inherited a large and prosperous farm from his father
and he'd owned land as far as the eye could see.

1261
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,960
But Attacus Greeb was a lazy man.

1262
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,480
He didn't like work.

1263
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,920
"I'm far too good to be milking cows," he said.

1264
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:41,040
"I should be Lord of the Manor with servants and footmen…and
heaps of silver and gold."

1265
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:46,400
So over the years, instead of working for a living he'd
simply sold off his possessions.

1266
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:59,600
He'd sold almost everything his father had given him - his house, his land, his horses, his pigs, his cattle and all he
was left with was one single goose who lived with him.

1267
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:03,000
"Oh what is to become of me?" wailed Attacus late one night.

1268
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:11,080
"I have no house, no food and no money and nothing left to
sell…I shall surely starve!" And then he looked at his
goose.

1269
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:26,240
"It's no good honking at me goosey it's off with you to the market tomorrow – you haven't laid an egg in weeks and your
feathers will fetch me a fair few guineas." And off he went to sleep.

1270
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:30,000
The next morning Attacus Greeb awoke to a glittering dawn.

1271
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:34,240
It was so light and bright he had to shield his eyes.

1272
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:41,440
But it wasn't the sunlight shining, he could hardly believe
what he saw, it was a gigantic, glorious…Golden Egg!

1273
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:53,760
"You clever girl! Ha! H!a Ho! Ho! We'll be rich! Rich beyond
our dreams!"

1274
01:53:53,760 --> 01:54:05,440
So off he went to market pushing the egg in an old wheelbarrow… and back he came with a barrowful of meat to
cook, chicken feed for his goose and a huge bag of coins.

1275
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:14,120
"Oh how I wish I had money to buy a horse-drawn carriage,"
he said patting his full tummy that night.

1276
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:16,520
"That's what I need to be happy."

1277
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:26,680
Well, the very next morning the same thing happened…there
was another shiny golden egg lying beside the goose.

1278
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:35,720
So off went Attacus to market and with the money he got he
bought a smart black carriage and six sleek horses.

1279
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:47,040
And every day the same thing happened and every day Attacus
Greeb counted his money and wished for more and more.

1280
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:53,760
But as fast as the little goose could lay a golden egg
Attacus Greeb wanted more.

1281
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:01,760
"Why can't you lay more eggs each day? We need more, we need
more I say!"

1282
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:12,840
Soon the farmer became a very rich man indeed – but as he
grew rich, he grew greedy – and still he wanted more.

1283
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:15,520
And then he had an idea.

1284
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:27,320
"How I wish I could have all the golden eggs at once," he thought, "instead of just one a day. Then I would surely be
happy."

1285
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:45,800
So the next morning he ordered his cook to kill the goose and open it up so he could take out all the eggs at once –
but, of course, to his horror there was nothing inside the poor goose…and there would be no golden eggs again.

1286
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:54,160
And Attacus Greeb ended up back in his tumble-down pigsty -
just where he belonged!

1287
01:55:54,160 --> 01:56:01,160
Those who have plenty want more and so lose all they have.

1288
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,040
THE KID AND THE WOLF

1289
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:22,640
Once there was a billy goat kid who lived with his mother on
a farm.

1290
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:26,800
Each morning he and the other goats were herded into a
meadow.

1291
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:29,560
And each evening they were driven home again.

1292
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:32,240
At the edge of the field was a wood.

1293
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:40,480
The grass grew thick and sweet there because the goats never
went near it.

1294
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,760
The kid looked at it longingly.

1295
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:47,120
"Don't go there," the other goats warned him.

1296
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:54,120
"A big bad wolf lives in that wood." "Yes, mind you stay
close by me," said his mother.

1297
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:58,400
At first the kid did stay close by his mother.

1298
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:01,800
But with each day that passed his horns grew bigger.

1299
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:06,240
"I am not a little kid any more," he thought.

1300
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:17,760
"I can look after myself. Anyway, I don't believe a wolf lives in that wood. The goats are just a bunch of
scaredy-cats!" He trotted over to where the juiciest grass grew.

1301
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,160
The goats shook their heads when they saw where the kid was.

1302
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:25,880
"Baaa. Silly young thing," they said.

1303
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:31,560
The little kid was very happy.

1304
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:35,440
He tore up the long stalks of sweet grass.

1305
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:39,920
He was so busy eating that he didn't hear his mother call
him.

1306
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,880
He didn't even notice the dogs rounding up the goats to
drive them home.

1307
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:50,520
"Oh, I do hope my little goat is safe," his mother said as
they were herded out of the field.

1308
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,920
At last the kid had had enough.

1309
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,760
He lifted up his head.

1310
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,640
The goats had gone.

1311
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,880
He was all alone.

1312
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,760
Long shadows crept towards him.

1313
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:06,200
It was growing dark.

1314
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:10,760
The kid did not feel so big and brave any more.

1315
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:16,000
"Mother," he bleated, running up and down the field.

1316
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,680
"Where are you? I want to go home."

1317
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:20,600
But his Mother didn't hear him.

1318
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:24,240
She was far away, down the lane.

1319
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,960
But someone heard him.

1320
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:32,720
Big yellow eyes followed the kid, as he ran up and down the
field.

1321
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,440
It was the wolf.

1322
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,920
He couldn't believe his luck.

1323
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:42,480
"It's time for my dinner and that kid will do nicely," he
smiled.

1324
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:43,920
"Well, we did warn him."

1325
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,240
And with a single bound he was out of the wood.

1326
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:50,760
The kid tried to run away, but the wolf put out a paw.

1327
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,560
"Whoa!" he growled.

1328
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,720
"Not so fast!"

1329
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,240
He smacked his lips.

1330
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:04,720
"If only I had listened to Mother," thought the kid.

1331
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:13,000
"What shall I do? How can I stop the wolf from eating me?
Help! Help!" He bleated, as loudly as he could.

1332
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,280
But the dogs and goats couldn't hear him.

1333
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:20,440
The wolf growled, showing sharp yellow teeth.

1334
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,720
Then the kid had an idea.

1335
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:32,040
"If I can get the wolf to sing, maybe Mother will hear him
and save me," he thought.

1336
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,760
"Mr Wolf," he squeaked.

1337
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:42,280
"I'm sure you have a beautiful voice. Will you sing for me?
And I will dance for you. I like dancing."

1338
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:43,360
The wolf considered.

1339
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,800
"Why not?" he thought.

1340
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:49,760
"A little music before dinner."

1341
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,280
He opened his mouth to sing.

1342
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:58,480
"Eeurgh what is that," the rabbits said darting back into
their burrows.

1343
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:06,160
"What a horrible noise!" said the moles digging themselves
hurriedly down into the earth.

1344
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:14,520
But in the pasture the little kid pranced and frolicked, kicking up his little legs as if he was having the most
wonderful time.

1345
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:19,400
"Oh wolf, he gasped. "How beautifully you sing."

1346
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:24,560
"You really think so?" simpered the Wolf, and howled even
louder.

1347
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:31,280
No one had ever told him he sang beautifully before.

1348
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:36,240
Down the lane the dogs and goats also heard the wolf.

1349
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:38,640
They stopped and looked at each other.

1350
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:41,480
"It's the wolf!" one of the dogs cried.

1351
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:45,520
"Oh, please – save my little goat!" cried the kid's mother.

1352
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,520
The dogs tore back into the field barking loudly.

1353
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:53,400
The wolf turned his head and saw them.

1354
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:59,560
He leapt for the trees just as one of the dogs was about to
seize his tail.

1355
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:10,040
"Why did I let that kid flatter me?" he growled to himself
as soon as he got his breath back.

1356
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:22,440
"Am I daft? I should have eaten him at once!"

1357
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,160
THE OLD LION AND THE FOX

1358
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:33,720
"It isn't easy being old," said Lion one day as he looked in
the mirror.

1359
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:43,040
"Look at my fangs, they're all worn down and my claws are
short and stubby!"

1360
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:59,840
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a herd of wildebeests," Lion grizzled, "but I'm not very good at hunting these days, I'm
too slow! I need to think of an easy way to catch my dinner."

1361
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:02,400
Then he had an idea.

1362
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:20,120
"If I can't get to my dinner, I'll make my dinner come to me! I'll pretend that I'm sick and all the animals will feel
sorry for me… they'll come to visit and as soon as they do I'll gobble them up!"

1363
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:24,200
Lion put his plan to work straight away.

1364
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:31,840
He settled himself in his den, put on his poorly face and
let out a sorrowful growl.

1365
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:43,880
"Oh woe is me, oh woe is me, I'm feeling sick as sick can
be!" he groaned.

1366
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:47,120
Bird came flitting by…

1367
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:52,520
"Oooh poor lion, you look very skinny!" she said.

1368
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:58,680
"That's because I'm poorly and I haven't felt like eating!"
lion fibbed.

1369
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:07,520
"Let me check your temperature," chirped bird and she hopped
inside lion's jaws with her thermometer.

1370
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:15,680
Then Lion nabbed her – grrr, grrr, snap…and put her in his
dinner sack.

1371
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:24,280
"Bird's aren't very filling," said Lion, "let's see what
else I can catch."

1372
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:30,920
He put on his poorly face again and let out another
sorrowful growl.

1373
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:39,480
"Oh woe is me, oh woe is me, I'm feeling sick as sick can
be!"

1374
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:44,160
Monkey jumped down from a tree to help.

1375
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:47,480
"What's wrong with you Lion?" he asked.

1376
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:51,360
"I feel weak and wobbly!" Lion fibbed.

1377
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:58,160
"Well you are looking a bit skinny… let me look at your
tongue," said monkey kindly.

1378
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:00,240
He peered inside lion's jaws…

1379
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:07,560
Then Lion nabbed him – grrr snap… and put him in his dinner
sack.

1380
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:20,520
"There isn't much meat on a monkey," grizzled Lion, "I'll have to keep trying. I need one more creature…something
bigger I hope."

1381
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:23,120
He let out another sad roar.

1382
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:31,000
"Oh woe is me, oh woe is me, I'm feeling poorly as can be!"

1383
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,040
"That's a shame," said Fox, appearing at the door of Lion's
den.

1384
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:42,480
"I think I might have a thorn in my throat," grizzled Lion.

1385
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,280
"Maybe you can pull it out."

1386
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:54,760
Fox looked at all the footprints outside Lion's den - they
were leading inside, but they didn't come out again.

1387
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,600
She spotted Lion's dinner sack too… it was wriggling.

1388
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:03,280
"Hmmm," she thought!

1389
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:07,160
"Lion is up to something, I'd better be careful."

1390
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:17,040
"I'll pull out the thorn in your throat," Fox told Lion, "but it's a tricky job, I want you to close your eyes and
keep very still.

1391
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:32,080
Lion closed his eyes tight, opened his jaws and got ready to
snap. He waited and he waited then suddenly Fox shouted. You can open your eyes now Lion.

1392
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:39,240
Lion opened his eyes just in time to see Fox running off
with his precious dinner sack.

1393
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:43,880
Drat, thought Lion, there goes my dinner!

1394
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:51,800
When Fox reached the wood she opened Lion's dinner sack and
set the creatures free.

1395
02:05:51,800 --> 02:06:03,320
I'll set you free this once, gruffed Fox. But never fall for
Lion's bluffs or if you do not use your brains you'll end up in his sack again!

1396
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:06,200
THE EAGLE AND THE JACKDAW

1397
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:38,760
"Oh my, look at that bird!" a Jackdaw exclaimed to her
husband one day. High above the nest a great eagle was
soaring.

1398
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:57,520
"Oh isn't he magnificent," she sighed watching him circle and swoop. She leant over the nest to take a better look.
Perched next to her was her husband who

1399
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:01,840
pushed back his shades and looked out to see what the fuss
was all about.

1400
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:02,800
"Hmm.

1401
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:07,440
He's just an eagle," he grumbled. "I'm as fine a bird as
him!"

1402
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,400
The nest was full of things he'd collected.

1403
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:13,360
Rings, bottle tops, feathers.

1404
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:17,680
The jackdaw smiled, looking at the glittering heap.

1405
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:20,760
"Mrs Jackdaw," he said to his wife.

1406
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:26,640
"You are a lucky bird. Look at all the beautiful things I've
brought you."

1407
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:30,040
"Humph!" grumbled the jackdaw's wife.

1408
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:38,000
"What use is it? You can't eat feathers and bottle tops! If
only you brought back something useful for a change."

1409
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,520
The jackdaw was very cross.

1410
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:45,560
He stared at the eagle as it swooped downwards.

1411
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:47,560
Suddenly he heard a bleat.

1412
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:54,160
The eagle had seized a lamb that had got separated from the
flock in the pasture below.

1413
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,960
The lamb bleated and struggled.

1414
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:59,200
But it was no use.

1415
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:03,680
The eagle had him firmly gripped in his talons.

1416
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:11,800
Up and up he flew again, higher and higher, the lamb
swinging from his claws.

1417
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:14,080
The jackdaw had had enough.

1418
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:20,240
"I'll show her," he muttered to himself.

1419
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:27,080
"I'm just as big and strong as that eagle. She'll see." He
hopped out of the nest.

1420
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:30,920
Then flapping his wings he flew down to a bush.

1421
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:36,160
His eyes gleamed as they lit on the farmer's prize ram.

1422
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:43,040
"Won't she be surprised when I bring that ram back for tea?"
he chuckled.

1423
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:49,040
And putting on his fiercest expression down he plopped, onto
the ram's back.

1424
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:56,920
"Up we go!" he cawed happily, flapping his wings and rising
up into the air again.

1425
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:01,640
But all that was swinging from his claws was a bit of wool.

1426
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:05,400
He dropped down again and tugged a bit harder.

1427
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,600
But he couldn't budge the ram.

1428
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:24,000
Up and down the jackdaw jumped, furiously flapping his wings
and tugging at the ram's woolly coat.

1429
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:27,480
But he couldn't lift the ram.

1430
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:34,080
"Silly old bird," said Mrs Jackdaw, who was watching.

1431
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,120
"He thinks he's an eagle!"

1432
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:49,320
The jackdaw pulled and he tugged, but the more he tugged and the more he pulled the more his claws got caught in the
ram's woolly coat until he could hardly move at all.

1433
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:54,200
Leaning by the gate, a shepherd had been watching.

1434
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:56,480
He ran up to the ram.

1435
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:03,680
"Silly old bird," the shepherd said taking out a pair of
scissors to clip his wings.

1436
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:08,200
"I'm taking you home with me. Can't have you messing with my
flock."

1437
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:14,480
When he got home that night the shepherd put the jackdaw
down on the table.

1438
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:18,360
"Come and see what I've brought you," he said to his
children.

1439
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:21,120
The children crowded round the table.

1440
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:25,560
"What sort of bird is it, Father?" one of them asked.

1441
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:31,240
"Well I call it a jackdaw, but he thinks he's an eagle," the
shepherd chuckled.

1442
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,760
He gave the jackdaw a stern look.

1443
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:38,360
"Perhaps you've learned your lesson now," he said.

1444
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,680
The jackdaw hung his head.

1445
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:48,200
Up in the jackdaw's nest, his wife stretched out happily.

1446
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:52,320
"I've seen the last of him," she said.

1447
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:59,280
"And good riddance too. Useless bird. Fancy thinking he was
an eagle!"

1448
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:06,040
THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING

1449
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:27,800
Mr Wolf dreamt of eating a nice woolly sheep for his
supper…but he just couldn't catch one.

1450
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:35,960
He spent his time spying on the sheep in Farmer Foggarty's
field… and thinking of wily ways to catch them.

1451
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:39,640
But his wily ways never seemed to work.

1452
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:55,400
One time he'd waited behind a rock for hours just so he could pounce on a juicy sheep…but when he heard the sound of
hooves and he leapt out of his hiding place…it was not a sheep he pounced on… …but an angry bull.

1453
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:05,480
It looked like Mr Wolf was never going to get a Sheepie
Supper.

1454
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:12,920
Then one day when he was visiting his Auntie Marge he
noticed a large sheep skin rug on the floor.

1455
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:32,920
Ha, he thought, I will borrow Auntie Marge's rug and disguise myself as a sheep, then I can easily get into
Farmer Foggarty's sheep pen; and once I'm in there, gnash, gobble, gnash, gobble…I will have my sheepie supper!

1456
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:43,000
As soon as he arrived home with the sheepskin rug he dressed
himself up and then practised talking in Sheep language.

1457
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:55,520
It was tricky at first, baaa…grrr! baaa…grrrr… but he soon
got the hang of it.

1458
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:56,520
Baaa!

1459
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,400
Baaa!

1460
02:12:58,440 --> 02:12:59,000
Baaa!

1461
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:04,760
Then he set off to Farmer Foggarty's field to join the
sheep.

1462
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:08,200
On the way he checked his reflection in the pond.

1463
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:09,920
I look cute, he said.

1464
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:12,280
Baaaa-ootiful!

1465
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:21,640
Farmer Foggarty's sheep were grazing happily when Mr Wolf
slyly slipped amongst the flock.

1466
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:25,240
He nibbled some grass just like they did.

1467
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,000
But it tasted yucky.

1468
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:38,760
So far his plan was working; the sheep didn't seem to notice
him, even though he was larger than they were; they all just kept nibbling the grass.

1469
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:50,160
I'll wait til sunset when the farmer puts the sheep in the pen and when I'm tucked up tight with them, gnash, gobble,
gnash, gobble, I'll have a delicious sheepie supper.

1470
02:13:50,160 --> 02:14:00,040
When sunset came, the farmer and his dog herded the sheep
into their pen and in went Mr Wolf as well.

1471
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:02,440
His disguise had worked.

1472
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:13,680
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm going to get me some juicy sheep! said
Mr Wolf to himself.

1473
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:18,760
Mummy, said one of the lambs, that sheep smells a bit funny!

1474
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:23,000
Don't be rude, said the lamb's mother.

1475
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:31,280
Ha ha, thought Mr Wolf, because you're so rude little
lambie, you will be the first to be gobbled.

1476
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:36,520
Sheep are woolly, sheep are yummy, Sheep are best in my
tummy!

1477
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:45,080
He flashed his claws and opened his jaws and was just about
to pounce when…Farmer Foggarty appeared.

1478
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:47,520
He was ready for his supper too.

1479
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:56,480
He wasn't having Bolognese and he wasn't having beans and
mashed potatoes in a heap.

1480
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:58,280
He was having SHEEP!

1481
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:07,680
The farmer looked at the herd carefully, he spotted the biggest, juiciest looking sheep and he hooked it with his
shepherd's hook.

1482
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:09,000
It was Mr Wolf.

1483
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:19,680
Drat, thought Mr Wolf, I thought I was going to get my
Sheepie Supper, but it looks like I'm the sheepie supper!

1484
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:28,200
With a lightning fast wriggle he freed himself from the
farmer's hook…and off he shot as fast as his legs could go.

1485
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:35,440
Excellent work, said Farmer Foggarty to his sheep, we fooled
that wily Mr Wolf!

1486
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:40,200
Now I'm off to have my egg and chips!

1487
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:48,080
THE GOATHERD AND THE WILD GOATS

1488
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:59,760
Wild goats live in wild, rocky places where it is hot during
the day and cold during the night.

1489
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:03,960
They eat dry leaves and thistles and bits of twig.

1490
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,520
Sometimes they go hungry.

1491
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:11,600
Sherpa, the leader of the wild goats was a magnificent
creature.

1492
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:16,600
He had a noble head, a long beard and two extraordinary
horns.

1493
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:26,680
The horns were so unusual they curled upwards and then downwards and ended up pointing in different directions from
each other.

1494
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:31,320
Sherpa wasn't only magnificent, he was also wise.

1495
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:38,200
"I've had a brilliant idea," he said to the rest of the herd
one day.

1496
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:45,200
He pointed to some other goats, in a field further down the
valley, eating a big pile of fragrant hay.

1497
02:16:45,240 --> 02:17:02,880
"They are tame goats," said Sherpa, "and they are looked after by a man called a Goatherd. They have plenty to eat
and a warm place to sleep. Not like us! We are often hungry and cold."

1498
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:08,080
The wild goats stopped clambering over rocks to listen.

1499
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:18,560
"My idea," Sherpa went on, "is to hop over the fence and
join them. Then we would be looked after too!"

1500
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:22,640
The other goats liked the sound of this.

1501
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:34,600
So, later that day, when the goatherd was changing his socks, the wild goats hopped into the field with the tame
goats and pretended they had been there all the time.

1502
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:36,600
That night it started to snow.

1503
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:42,760
The goatherd rounded up his goats and counted them.

1504
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:45,400
"That's funny," he said.

1505
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:48,760
"There are twice as many now, than there were before."

1506
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,040
He was pleased.

1507
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:55,000
More goats meant more milk and cheese to sell in the market.

1508
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,680
The goatherd looked after his new goats well.

1509
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:02,280
He gave them the best food and the warmest beds.

1510
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:06,840
He brushed their coats and polished their hooves and combed
their beards.

1511
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:08,400
He spoiled them.

1512
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:14,120
"If they are happy they'll stay with me," he said to
himself.

1513
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:18,800
But the goatherd didn't look after his own goats.

1514
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:22,280
He turned them out in the snow and gave them less to eat.

1515
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:26,560
He no longer brushed and polished and combed them.

1516
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:28,080
He treated them unfairly.

1517
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:31,560
But, the wild goats couldn't believe their luck.

1518
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:35,120
"This is the life," they said to each other.

1519
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:38,640
Their leader, Sherpa, wasn't so sure.

1520
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:41,520
He was beginning to have doubts.

1521
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:44,880
"I'm not happy about this," he said.

1522
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:49,360
"Why is the goatherd treating his own goats so badly?"

1523
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:53,520
"Who cares about them," said one goat, unkindly.

1524
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:56,800
"As long as we are all right," said another.

1525
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:58,600
Sherpa told them off.

1526
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:01,400
"Think carefully," he said.

1527
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:08,920
"What happens if some newer goats come along. Will the
goatherd start treating us badly?"

1528
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:14,160
The more Sherpa thought about it, the more certain he was he
was right.

1529
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:21,280
"We have to leave at the first opportunity," he told his
herd.

1530
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:25,480
Spring came and the snow disappeared.

1531
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:28,960
The wild goats went back into the field.

1532
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:32,000
But Sherpa hadn't forgotten what he had said.

1533
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:40,240
One afternoon, when the goatherd was dozing in the sun,
Sherpa ordered the wild goats to play leapfrog.

1534
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:45,240
They made a lot of noise, running and jumping and getting in
each others way.

1535
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:55,200
And by the time the goatherd could work out what was happening, the wild goats had not only leapfrogged over each
other they also leapfrogged over the fence.

1536
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,040
The goatherd was furious.

1537
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:00,960
"Rascals!" he yelled.

1538
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,280
"Is this how you repay my kindness?"

1539
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:07,280
Sherpas answer came from half way down the valley:

1540
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:12,400
"You should have treated all your goats the same," he called
back.

1541
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:15,560
"That would have been real kindness."

1542
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:21,480
The tame goats, left behind in the field, nodded their heads
sadly.

1543
02:20:21,480 --> 02:20:22,920
They had to agree.

1544
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:24,200
THE DOG IN THE MANGER

1545
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:27,120
It had been another busy day at the farm.

1546
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:28,040
Dog yawned.

1547
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:44,200
It was hot, hot, hot!

1548
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:48,320
And Dog was tired.

1549
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,840
He looked around for somewhere to snooze.

1550
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:53,760
The barn was shady and quiet.

1551
02:20:53,760 --> 02:21:00,000
And in the barn there was a manger, and it was full of hay
to feed the cows.

1552
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,360
Ah, yes!

1553
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:05,720
The manger was just the right place for a dog to sleep.

1554
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:11,720
It was soft and smelled of fresh hay and it was cool in the
barn after the heat of the sun.

1555
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:24,040
Dog climbed into the manger and turned around – once…twice… three times – and curled himself into a nest of hay with his
nose by his tail.

1556
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:29,720
At that moment, who should come into the barn but Bull and
all the cows?

1557
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:37,520
"Time for some dinner, my dears?" said Bull, stepping aside
to allow his wives to go into the barn first.

1558
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:44,240
"Oh, thank you dear!" replied Queeny-cow, daintily strolling
in at the head of the herd.

1559
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:51,120
"You are such a gentleman! A nice munch of cool hay would be
very nice – OH!"

1560
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,760
She stopped when she saw Dog.

1561
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:56,840
All the cows stopped when they saw Dog.

1562
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:02,240
Dog didn't open his eyes, but his ears pricked up like
satellite dishes.

1563
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:09,600
"Oh dear, said Queenie-cow, as Bull came up beside her.
"There appears to be a dog in the manger!"

1564
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:12,720
"A dog? A dog?" blustered Bull.

1565
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:22,200
"What would a dog be doing in the manger? Dogs don't eat
hay! I say! I say, Dog! What are you doing in our manger?"

1566
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:24,000
"Sleeping," grunted Dog.

1567
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,920
"Go away!"

1568
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:28,960
"Well!" said Queenie-cow in a sulky voice.

1569
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:32,480
"That's no way to behave in front of ladies!"

1570
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:36,080
"You are not ladies – you are cattle," said Dog.

1571
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:38,280
"That's what you are."

1572
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:42,080
"Well!" squeaked Queenie-cow, offended.

1573
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:45,120
"I have never been spoken to in that way!"

1574
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:47,760
"Hrmph!" snorted Bull.

1575
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:59,160
"I must ask you to not speak to my wife that way. She's very
delicate, you know! My dear," he said to Queenie-cow, "Leave this to me!"

1576
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:09,320
"Sir!" he continued, lowering his head and displaying his
very fine horns, "I must ask you to leave the manger NOW!"

1577
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:12,400
"Or else?" asked Dog.

1578
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:17,800
He rose up on stiff legs, lowered his head and bared his
teeth.

1579
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:19,600
"OR ELSE?" he barked.

1580
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:26,160
Bull looked at the fierce dog and backed away in sudden
confusion.

1581
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:30,680
"Alright! Alright! K..K..Keep your hair on!"

1582
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:33,640
"Attack him!" Queenie-cow encouraged.

1583
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:35,600
"Don't be cowed!"

1584
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:40,120
"I am cowed!" squeaked Bull, backing away towards the door.

1585
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:47,560
"I have just remembered what my dear old mother always used
to say to me! She said "Let sleeping dog's lie!"

1586
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:49,720
Goodbye!"

1587
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:52,040
And Bull lumbered out of the barn.

1588
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:54,840
"Well!" said Queenie-cow.

1589
02:23:54,840 --> 02:24:02,560
"So much for him - we'll do this my way!" she said, turning
smartly and wandering out of the door.

1590
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:08,280
"Delusional!" muttered Dog, watching the cows nudging out of
the barn door.

1591
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:13,440
"Daft!" snorted Dog, turning around three times in the hay.

1592
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:22,320
"Dippy!" decided Dog, curling himself into a nest of hay
with a groan of contentment and shutting his eyes.

1593
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:26,480
"DOG!" roared a man's voice.

1594
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:29,320
Farmer John stormed furiously in through the barn door.

1595
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:31,600
"DOG!" he shouted angrily.

1596
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:49,360
"Get out of that manger at once, you selfish animal! There are silly cows milling everywhere they shouldn't be! I've
got cows in my kitchen! I've got cows in my car! And I've got a Bull hiding under my bed! Stop being a dog in a manger and go and round up the sheep!"

1597
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:56,800
Dog jumped down from the hay and skulked out of the barn
with his tail between his legs.

1598
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:58,720
"Drat!" he sighed.

1599
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:11,320
"It's a dog's life!"

1600
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:12,880
ANDROCLES AND THE LION

1601
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:24,840
Once there was a slave called Androcles who belonged to a
very cruel master.

1602
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:31,880
Androcles worked all day long in his master's fields and was
never paid a single penny.

1603
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:39,360
He was always tired and hungry and one night Androcles
decided to escape.

1604
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:51,600
He waited until his master was fast asleep then he crept out of the house...and silently made his way into the
forest...and started running.

1605
02:25:51,600 --> 02:26:00,880
Androcles knew that if he was caught he'd be punished so he
ran all night and in the morning he lay down to rest.

1606
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:07,840
He'd just fallen asleep when he was woken by a terrible
roaring sound.

1607
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:16,520
Androcles jumped to his feet and standing right in front of
him was a huge Lion.

1608
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:33,440
He was about to run away when he noticed the lion was holding out his paw...and...he wasn't really roaring...he
was crying because a huge thorn was sticking out of his paw.

1609
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:39,040
"Ouch! No wonder you're crying," said Androcles to the lion.

1610
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:43,840
"I'd like to help you but if I come any closer you'll
probably eat me."

1611
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:53,880
But the lion had such a sad look in its eye that before Androcles had time to think he'd stepped forward and pulled
out the thorn.

1612
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:58,160
The lion opened his mouth and let out a terrible cry...

1613
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:08,600
...and for a moment Androcles thought he was going to be eaten but instead of biting Androcles the lion gently licked
his face.

1614
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:14,960
Androcles fetched some water from a stream and washed the
Lion's bleeding paw.

1615
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:18,640
"You'll be alright now," said Androcles.

1616
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:27,120
The lion licked Androcles one last time as if to say "thank
you" then limped off into the forest.

1617
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:29,920
Then Androcles heard a voice.

1618
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:34,200
"That's him. Quickly...tie him up."

1619
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:37,200
Androcles knew that voice.

1620
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,200
It was his master.

1621
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,960
Six men grabbed Androcles and tied him up with ropes.

1622
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:45,560
"Thought you would escape did you?" said the master.

1623
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:47,760
"Nobody escapes from me."

1624
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:51,240
Now Androcles was in really big trouble.

1625
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:56,040
The men took Androcles to the city and threw him in prison.

1626
02:27:56,040 --> 02:28:01,040
Next day a prison guard brought Androcles some food.

1627
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:13,560
"Do you hear that roaring Androcles? We haven't fed that lion since we caught him. But he's going to have plenty to
eat tomorrow when we put you in his cage."

1628
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:22,040
Next morning Androcles was taken to a huge arena like a
football stadium.

1629
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:30,240
The Emperor and thousands of his people had come to see a
man being eaten by a lion.

1630
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:37,360
In the centre of the arena was a cage and in the cage was a
huge, very hungry lion.

1631
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:45,480
The crowd clapped and cheered as the guards pushed Androcles
into the cage and slammed the door shut.

1632
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:52,800
Everyone went very still as the lion leapt towards
Androcles.

1633
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,640
But then something odd happened.

1634
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,360
The lion stopped and stood very still.

1635
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:01,560
He knew this man.

1636
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:05,000
He'd seen him somewhere before.

1637
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,440
Then he remembered the thorn that had stuck in his paw.

1638
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:14,760
"Are you going to eat me then old friend?" said Androcles.

1639
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:18,800
But the lion just purred and licked the slave's face.

1640
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:21,640
At first the crowd were angry.

1641
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:25,040
This wasn't supposed to happen.

1642
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:27,640
They hadn't paid good money to see a lion lick a man's face.

1643
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:39,000
But the Emperor stood up and said, "This is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen." and he started to clap...

1644
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:45,200
...and the people thought, "If the Emperor's clapping then
maybe I should clap too."

1645
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:49,640
Soon clapping and cheering rang round the arena.

1646
02:29:49,680 --> 02:30:03,640
Androcles was taken to the palace and when the Emperor heard the story of the lion and the thorn he announced that both
Androcles and the lion should be given their freedom.

1647
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:11,160
"Androcles, you helped the lion so the lion helped you "
said the Emperor.

1648
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:17,440
"See how one good deed leads to another. You're a free man
now."

1649
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:24,720
Androcles and the lion walked out of the city together; both
free.

1650
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:39,200
THE DOG AND HIS REFLECTION

1651
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:45,080
When Patch was young he was a good dog.

1652
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:55,560
He was warm and soft and had the sweetest breath, and he
licked the tip of your nose if you let him.

1653
02:30:55,560 --> 02:31:00,600
And because he was so good he was allowed to stay in the
farm kitchen.

1654
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:03,680
The other farm dogs lived outside in a kennel.

1655
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:14,160
But just because a dog is warm and soft and good when he's a puppy, and licks the tip of your nose if you let him, it
doesn't mean he will grow up like that.

1656
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:23,840
Once, when Patch was a fully grown up dog he pulled the cloth off the table and all the family's dinner crashed to
the floor.

1657
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:30,040
He had eaten it all up before the farmer's wife came running
in.

1658
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:34,000
"Bad dog!" scolded the farmer's wife.

1659
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:40,000
He barked at the children and bit their legs when they rode
their bikes.

1660
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:42,680
"Bad dog!" cried the children.

1661
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:50,160
He pulled up all the flowers outside the kitchen door, dug five holes in the lawn and did his business in the farmer's
hat.

1662
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:52,400
"Bad dog!" yelled the farmer.

1663
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:57,400
So Patch was sent outside with the other dogs.

1664
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:04,000
And because people only said "bad dog!" to him, everyone
forgot he'd once been called Patch.

1665
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,960
Now he was called simply, "Bad Dog".

1666
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:16,080
At feeding time every dog had their own bowl of biscuits and
scraps from the table, but Bad Dog would get to them first.

1667
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:22,560
He would growl and snarl and turn up his lips to show how
sharp his teeth were.

1668
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:29,640
The other dogs had to wait, licking their mouths until Bad
Dog had finished eating.

1669
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:45,200
When he had eaten all the meat and the gravy, and all the dog biscuits from the bowls, all that was left was dry bread
and carrots and broccoli, and lots of other things that farmers eat but dogs don't.

1670
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:48,280
But then one day he went too far.

1671
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:53,640
The smell of roast meat was wafting out from the kitchen.

1672
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:59,720
Bad Dog ran in, snatched the huge bone with the meat still
on and ran off with it.

1673
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,560
"Bad Dog," screamed the farmer, running after him.

1674
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:07,560
"Come back with that meat now, or you'll never come back
again!"

1675
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,400
Bad Dog took no notice.

1676
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:16,000
This was a whole big bone with the meat still on, not
scraps, and he wanted it more than anything.

1677
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,480
So Bad Dog ran away with it.

1678
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:25,120
He ran for a long time until at last he came to a little
bridge.

1679
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:29,120
This would be a good place to stop and eat his stolen
dinner.

1680
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:31,680
He looked over the side of the bridge.

1681
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:34,000
And had such a shock!

1682
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,840
Below him in the still water was another dog.

1683
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:45,640
A big, fierce, ugly dog - and this dog had a bone with all
the meat on too!

1684
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:47,400
Bad Dog had to have it.

1685
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:50,320
Two joints of meat!

1686
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:56,360
His lips turned back in a snarl, and so did the lips of the
other dog.

1687
02:33:56,400 --> 02:34:00,840
He opened his mouth to growl…And so did the other dog!

1688
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:06,960
And the bone fell from Bad Dog's jaws into the water and was
taken away by the stream.

1689
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:15,920
It had been his own reflection in the still water he had
seen, and now instead of two bones he had nothing.

1690
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:17,720
Bad Dog felt sad.

1691
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:23,200
He had lost everything that was important.

1692
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:41,320
"From now on," he said to himself, "I shall try and be better. I shall be good instead of bad and nice instead of
nasty. Then one day... ...everyone will love me again."

1693
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:43,600
And that is what happened.

1694
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:47,960
If you are too greedy, he realised, it's easy to end up with
nothing.

1695
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:51,040
THE HERON AND THE FISH

1696
02:34:51,040 --> 02:35:03,560
The heron walked like a king along the grassy river bank.

1697
02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:07,280
The otter curtseyed as the heron passed.

1698
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:11,360
The water vole bent his knee as the heron passed.

1699
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:20,160
The kingfisher bowed so low as the heron passed that she turned completely upside down on the branch she was clinging
to.

1700
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:22,200
But the otter was not being polite.

1701
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:26,120
The water vole was not being reverent.

1702
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:29,200
The kingfisher was not being respectful.

1703
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:33,640
They were making fun of the heron, though he didn't know it.

1704
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:37,760
They thought he had far too good an opinion of himself.

1705
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:40,200
They laughed at him behind his back.

1706
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,120
Herons are only birds.

1707
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:47,600
They are not Princes or Prime Ministers, Presidents or
pop-stars.

1708
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:53,400
They are definitely not Kings, even if they walk like Kings
on grassy river banks.

1709
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:56,480
In other words, they are nothing special.

1710
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:58,440
They just think they are.

1711
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:03,440
They parade along in a very high-minded fashion with their
noses in the air.

1712
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:06,800
Or they would do if they had noses.

1713
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:08,520
They have long beaks instead.

1714
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:15,400
Everything about the heron is long – he has a long beak,
long neck, long body and long legs.

1715
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:18,840
The heron has especially long legs.

1716
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:29,800
And although the heron walks along the grassy river bank on his especially long legs, he only stands on one of them, so
he has a spare.

1717
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:36,880
There is one good thing to be said of herons: they have
great patience.

1718
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:41,360
When fishing he can stand quite still for hours waiting for
their supper.

1719
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:49,240
He was quite snappy if the otter and the water vole and the kingfisher were there before him because they made such a
kafuffle.

1720
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:53,680
They were always doing things, these lesser creatures.

1721
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:55,000
They chattered.

1722
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,200
They swam.

1723
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:58,680
They dug holes in the river bank.

1724
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:04,160
They did high dives and low belly-flops; all splashy, noisy,
annoying things!

1725
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:09,920
They played games, when all he wanted was peace and quiet.

1726
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:14,280
Then one day he came to the river later than usual.

1727
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:16,720
The others had already finished for the day.

1728
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:19,400
The otter was curled up on the grassy bank.

1729
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:22,040
The water vole was cleaning his fur.

1730
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:25,640
The kingfisher was pecking at something in his feathers.

1731
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:27,680
"At last," thought the heron.

1732
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:31,560
"I shall have the river to myself."

1733
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:40,760
He waded out to his favourite spot of clear water, pulled up
his spare leg so that he was standing on only one, and began being patient.

1734
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:44,560
It didn't take long for a minnow to swim by.

1735
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:46,560
The heron watched it go past.

1736
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:51,520
"You missed a fish, oh great one," said the otter.

1737
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:55,520
"It wasn't worth my attention," said the heron.

1738
02:37:55,520 --> 02:38:01,680
Then a stickleback swam by, and kept swimming by and the
heron still didn't move.

1739
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:07,560
"You missed a nice little snack there, majesty," said the
water vole.

1740
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:09,720
"Nice for you," said the heron.

1741
02:38:09,720 --> 02:38:11,560
"Little for me."

1742
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:17,440
Other fish swam by, each larger than the one before, but the
heron gave them hardly a glance.

1743
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:24,040
Then a very fine perch came by, a prize fit for a King – but
not for a heron.

1744
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:29,320
"You missed a big one there, Highness," said the kingfisher.

1745
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:33,480
"Only a salmon is good enough for me!" claimed the heron.

1746
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:40,560
But not another fish came by that day; not a minnow, not a
stickleback, and especially not a perch.

1747
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:47,920
The heron could have eaten his fill if he'd been satisfied
with what was on offer.

1748
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:49,560
Instead he went hungry…

1749
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:57,120
…Except for one tiny snail.

1750
02:38:57,160 --> 02:39:12,280
So, don't be too hard to please or you might end up with
nothing.

1751
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:14,440
THE EAGLE AND THE TORTOISE

1752
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:20,440
In a tumbledown cottage deep in the countryside lived Old
Mrs Mumbles.

1753
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:28,200
Every morning, she opened the kitchen door…and threw the
remains of last night's dinner onto the grass.

1754
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:35,000
"Three, two, one…bet I get there first!" cried Racy Rabbit.

1755
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:43,880
All the animals that lived in the garden charged towards the
food – all except Tod the very slow tortoise.

1756
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:46,760
"Wait for me…!" he croaked.

1757
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:59,880
But it was no good – Racy Rabbit, Fox and the birds were greedily tucking into vegetable peelings and left over
stew…and by the time Tod arrived, there was nothing left.

1758
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:08,600
"It's not faaaaaair, he moaned. "I've only got short little
legs and my shell is really heavy.

1759
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:12,560
I'm so slow I always get there last."

1760
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:18,120
"Never mind, Tod," squeaked his friend, Milly Mouse.

1761
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:21,400
"Look, I've saved you a nice piece of lettuce."

1762
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:28,200
As Tod chomped away, he spotted a great Eagle soaring on the
light breeze way up high.

1763
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:34,120
"I wish I could fly like that eagle," he sighed.

1764
02:40:34,120 --> 02:40:38,760
"Just imagine how fast and free I would be!"

1765
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:47,160
The next day, Tod poked his head from his shell – and nearly
jumped out of it in surprise.

1766
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:51,480
For the eagle was standing on the grass, looking right at
him.

1767
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:57,160
"Us eagles have very good eyesight you know", she said in a
rather raspy voice.

1768
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:06,600
"I read your lips yesterday. And I have come to grant you
your wish. I shall teach you to fly in the sky."

1769
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:11,520
"Ohhh! Thank you, Eagle!" cried Tod.

1770
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:14,720
"I'll give you anything you want in return."

1771
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:19,680
"Anything?" asked the Eagle with a glint in her eye.

1772
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:22,840
"Yes, anything," replied Tod.

1773
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:30,280
Tod gasped with excitement as the Eagle carried him high
into the sky.

1774
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:37,920
Mountains and oceans and forests and castles were spread out
below as far as he could see.

1775
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:43,880
"I can fly!" cried Tod with delight.

1776
02:41:43,880 --> 02:41:50,080
"Now, there's just the small matter of my payment," said the
Eagle.

1777
02:41:50,080 --> 02:42:01,040
"I'm rather partial to small, cuddly creatures for my tea,
so I'd like that little mouse you were talking too."

1778
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:08,160
"What?! But you can't eat Milly – she's my best friend,"
protested Tod.

1779
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:13,080
"But you promised to give me whatever I wanted," said the
Eagle.

1780
02:42:13,080 --> 02:42:18,440
"Er, yes I know - but not Milly, pleeeease…" pleaded Tod.

1781
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:21,320
There was a horrible silence.

1782
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:26,280
Todd shivered in the cold wind and looked down.

1783
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:28,200
It was an awfully long way to the ground…

1784
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:31,480
"Very well then," said the Eagle.

1785
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:40,200
"You wanted to fly – so let's see how you manage by
yourself." And with that, she shook Tod off her back.

1786
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:46,400
"Heeeeeeelp!" cried Tod as he fell through the air.

1787
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:50,200
"You forgot to tell me how to do it!!!"

1788
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:56,920
"It's easy, just flap!" cried the now distant Eagle.

1789
02:42:56,920 --> 02:43:02,040
Tod flapped and flapped his little legs, but it was no use.

1790
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:04,600
Down he dropped like a very heavy stone.

1791
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:10,040
"I don't think I like flying after all…" he gasped.

1792
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:19,000
"I'd much rather be back on the ground. The problem is, the
ground's getting very close…very fast…!"

1793
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:26,600
As the garden rushed up to meet him, Tod shut his eyes…then
ever so slowly…opened them again…

1794
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:33,120
He had landed in a giant pile of lettuce leaves.

1795
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:42,000
"We thought we'd give you a soft landing just in case your
flying lesson went horribly wrong," giggled Racy Rabbit.

1796
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:50,440
"Lucky for you, Old Mrs Mumbles had a big party last night,
and threw out loads of left overs!" added Milly.

1797
02:43:50,480 --> 02:43:55,080
That night, the animals celebrated with a feast.

1798
02:43:55,280 --> 02:44:01,120
"Thanks for saving my life, guys," said Tod as he chomped on
lettuce.

1799
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:10,960
"You know, I much prefer being slow and steady to flying all
fast and whizzy. I even like my shell a bit more."

1800
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:19,960
He pulled his little friend under his shell, and they
munched to their hearts" content till the sun came out
again.

1801
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:24,360
THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE

1802
02:44:24,360 --> 02:44:33,360
Town Mouse was very fond of his own appearance.

1803
02:44:33,400 --> 02:45:01,920
"I shall visit my friend Country Mouse," he announced one morning, waxing his whiskers with a dab of butter and
admiring his reflection in the teapot. "And he shall see what a very fine mouse I am!"

1804
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:12,280
And with a hop and a skip he straightened his bow tie and scurried off to catch the 10.17 packing crate bound for
Paddington station.

1805
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:34,480
Meanwhile, deep in the trunk of an old chestnut tree, Country Mouse was busy dusting and tidying, cleaning and
sweeping and cooking an extra special hotpot of beans and corn to welcome his cousin from the city.

1806
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:37,960
He had been collecting food all week to celebrate.

1807
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:46,280
There was a loud rap at the door and Country Mouse took off
his apron and scampered over to greet his friend.

1808
02:45:46,280 --> 02:45:54,040
There on the doorstep stood Town Mouse looking very smart
indeed in his pin-stripe suit and bowler hat.

1809
02:45:54,080 --> 02:46:10,680
He handed Country Mouse his gloves and bag, looked down his long nose and said, "What a very small house you have dear
cousin… no chandeliers, no Persian rugs… no velvet cushion to rest upon?"

1810
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:20,120
Country Mouse smiled, he was very fond of Town Mouse and he ignored his snooty remarks - he knew that he didn't mean to
be rude.

1811
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:30,320
"Come and sit down, dear cousin. You must be tired and hungry from your journey," he said pulling out a little
acorn stool for him to sit on.

1812
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:36,720
"What no napkins?…no silver service?" sniffed Town Mouse.

1813
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:39,880
"No scented bowl to wash my paws?"

1814
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:46,480
Country Mouse smiled again and served up the hot soup and
barleyseed bread.

1815
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:50,920
"What is this food?" scoffed Town Mouse.

1816
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:53,720
"No caviar, no steak tartare?

1817
02:46:53,760 --> 02:47:03,960
No pickled herring and horseradish sauce?! Come, my friend, this instant! We're off to the city and I shall show you how
to live!"

1818
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:30,360
It was late that night when they arrived at Town Mouse's House and as they crept along the hall to the grand dining
room Country Mouse felt the soft wool carpet under his tired little paws and the warm glow of the fire and he remembered the cold, bitter wind that blew through his country tree cottage.

1819
02:47:30,360 --> 02:47:41,480
And how his little eyes beamed and his whiskers twitched at the sight of the left over feast that was laid out on the
table for them to gobble up!

1820
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:47,160
There were soufflés and sandwiches, savoury flans and
pastries.

1821
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:52,920
There were jellies and trifles and fresh cream cakes and a
MOUNTAIN of meringues…

1822
02:47:52,920 --> 02:48:02,320
"Couthin…I'b neber seen such a banquet as thith!" cried
Country Mouse.

1823
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:07,520
"But this is how you could feast EVERY night my friend!"
laughed Town Mouse.

1824
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:10,640
The two little mice had a very merry time…

1825
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:16,720
Then all of a sudden there was a thunderous ROAR!

1826
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:25,160
"Wwwwwwwhat's that terrible noise Cousin?!" stammered
Country Mouse.

1827
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:31,720
"H-h-h-h-hoover?!" cried the terrified little mouse.

1828
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:35,440
"Yes…oh and the Humans"…

1829
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:44,840
And just at that moment the door burst open and in marched a
team of kitchen staff with brooms and mops.

1830
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:53,360
"WHAT EEZ ZEES?!" shouted the French Chef…"MEESES! Quick
hoover zem up!"

1831
02:48:53,440 --> 02:49:01,000
"Yikes!" squeaked Country Mouse as they scampered down the
table leg and through a crack in the floorboards.

1832
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,800
"I'm off!" he cried as he scurried off under the door.

1833
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:08,000
"So soon?" called Town Mouse.

1834
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:12,760
"No fabulous food? No smart city life?"

1835
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:22,960
"No, no, dear cousin," called Country Mouse over his
shoulder.

1836
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:35,080
"And no loud scary monsters to gobble me up! It's the simple, safe life at home for me…not the rich, dangerous
high life!"

1837
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,920
BELLING THE CAT

1838
02:49:36,920 --> 02:50:01,720
The mice who lived on a farm were very happy because the farmer's cat which was supposed to hunt and kill mice was
old and lazy and spent most of his time sleeping in the sunshine.

1839
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:08,240
"Can't be bothered with catching mice any more," said the
old cat.

1840
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:15,720
"All that lurking about and pouncing. Got better things to
do...like sleeping."

1841
02:50:15,720 --> 02:50:27,040
So the mice ran about safely all over the farm and had
plenty to eat...until one day an awful thing happened.

1842
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:33,640
The farmer came into the farmyard carrying a wooden box.

1843
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:46,360
He put it on the floor and...out of the box walked a cat; a
new young cat with black sleek fur and long sharp claws.

1844
02:50:46,360 --> 02:50:52,120
The cat looked around the farmyard and she sniffed the air.

1845
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:57,680
"Huh, she's nothing to be scared of," said a young mouse.

1846
02:50:57,680 --> 02:51:01,600
"She's only a cat. Only a lazy old cat."

1847
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:03,880
But an old mouse wasn't so sure.

1848
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,000
The new cat didn't look old...or lazy.

1849
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,800
This cat looked young and keen and...hungry.

1850
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:16,240
"Just be careful," said the old mouse.

1851
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:21,320
"Just keep your eyes open and be very careful."

1852
02:51:21,320 --> 02:51:26,320
That night the new cat prowled the farmyard.

1853
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:32,960
She walked silently in the darkness; invisible in her black
coat.

1854
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:37,760
She watched and she waited; listening for the tiniest sound.

1855
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:47,200
In the morning when the mice met for breakfast in the barn
there didn't seem to be quite so many of them.

1856
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:53,360
"Where is everyone this morning?" said the young mouse.

1857
02:51:53,360 --> 02:52:02,160
"I wonder," said the old mouse looking at the new cat who was sitting outside the farmhouse with a big smile on her
face.

1858
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:09,640
Each night more mice disappeared… and the new cat seemed to
be getting fatter.

1859
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:11,760
Soon the mice were really scared.

1860
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:15,600
Finally the old mouse called a meeting.

1861
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:18,680
"We have to do something," he said.

1862
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:25,880
"If we can't get rid of this cat she'll end up eating us
all. We need a plan."

1863
02:52:25,880 --> 02:52:38,640
"The problem," said the old mouse, "is that you can't hear the cat coming. She moves silently in the darkness. You
don't know she's there...until it's too late."

1864
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:41,520
"That's it!" said the young mouse.

1865
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:52,440
"We get a bell and tie it round the cat's neck. The bell will ring every time the cat moves and we'll know where she
is so she'll never catch us."

1866
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:54,520
The mice all looked at each other.

1867
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:57,200
"Not bad," said someone.

1868
02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:02,320
"Actually, that's brilliant!" said someone else.

1869
02:53:02,320 --> 02:53:04,160
The mice leapt into action.

1870
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:14,360
One group found a little bell that had fallen off the back of the farmhouse door and another found some string which
had been holding up a scarecrow's trousers.

1871
02:53:14,360 --> 02:53:16,480
"See," said the young mouse.

1872
02:53:16,480 --> 02:53:26,280
"We have everything we need for my brilliant plan. That cat
has eaten her last mouse. All our troubles are over."

1873
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:31,000
The mice all cheered and patted the young mice on the back.

1874
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:39,200
The young mouse had saved everyone from being eaten and
suddenly he was a hero...for about ten seconds.

1875
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:44,640
"Just one question," said the old mouse.

1876
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:48,320
"Who's going to tie the bell on the cat?"

1877
02:53:48,320 --> 02:53:54,200
The mice all went silent then looked at the young mouse.

1878
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:56,920
The young mouse looked at the floor.

1879
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,320
He didn't want that job.

1880
02:53:59,320 --> 02:54:00,560
Nobody wanted that job.

1881
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:03,760
"Oh dear," said the old mouse.

1882
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:10,520
"It's easy to say something but often harder to actually do
it."

1883
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:12,680
THE TOO FAT FOX

1884
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:38,280
A bitter wind blew the last leaves from the trees as Fox
made his way across the fields in search of food.

1885
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:46,160
The lake had been frozen for weeks and the livestock were
tucked up safe and warm in the farmer's winter barns.

1886
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:49,160
Fox couldn't remember when he had last eaten.

1887
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:58,840
His skinny ribs stuck through his patchy, moth-eaten coat, his teeth chattered and the hard frosty ground hurt his paws
as he walked.

1888
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:16,960
"Not a chicken, not a bird, not a puny little rabbit…not a scrap of food for a fox to eat…I shall surely die of cold
and hunger," he muttered miserably as he huddled up against a gnarled old tree trunk for shelter.

1889
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:31,560
Earlier that morning, not far from where our Fox was crouching, Mrs Tom Cobbler was busy fussing around her
husband and shooing him out of the farmhouse.

1890
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:55,480
"Here's yer shopping list Mr Tom Cobbler - one nice, juicy leg of pork, 2 kilos of potatoes, half a bag of carrots, 2
onions and some big, firm cooking apples for our Sunday lunch. Now don't you go forgetting anything Mr Tom Cobbler. You're the most forgetful man I ever knew!" and she waved a dishcloth at him.

1891
02:55:55,480 --> 02:56:07,160
"Yars, Mrs Tom Cobbler…er I mean… no dear, I won't forget." And he stuffed the shopping list in his trouser pocket and
walked off to market.

1892
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:16,440
It was a long, cold walk to market and it was a long, hard walk back with his rucksack full of his wife's Sunday
shopping.

1893
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:26,840
Mr Tom Cobbler decided to sit down for a moment's rest beside a tree. (The very tree our Mr Fox was going to huddle
close too later on.)

1894
02:56:26,840 --> 02:56:35,200
After his rest and before he set off down the lane he looked about for a place to hide his shopping bag and saw a hollow
in the tree trunk.

1895
02:56:35,240 --> 02:56:48,920
"Ah, that'll do, he said. "That'll keep it safe from foxes – that hole's far too small for a plump ol" fox to climb
through." And off he tramped up the hill towards the farmyard.

1896
02:56:48,920 --> 02:57:00,320
Well…what a nice surprise for our Mr Fox crouching beside
that very same tree later that morning.

1897
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:08,400
His sly foxy nose began to twitch…and he sniffed the cold
wintry air…there was a whiff of FOOD nearby!

1898
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:14,760
And it seemed to be coming from the hollow of the very tree
he sat against.

1899
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:23,120
And because he was so very starved and thin – our TOO THIN
MR FOX was able to slip easily through into the hole.

1900
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:25,640
And what did he find inside?

1901
02:57:25,640 --> 02:57:27,120
That's right!

1902
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:29,600
All Mrs Tom Cobbler's Sunday dinner!

1903
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:31,440
And what did he do with it?

1904
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:32,720
That's right!

1905
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:36,960
He gobbled it all up, lickity-quick.

1906
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:49,600
And he felt very full indeed…SO full in fact that our TOO THIN FOX had become TOO FAT FOX in a matter of ten minutes
flat!

1907
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:52,840
Too fat in fact to fit back through the hole.

1908
02:57:52,880 --> 02:58:06,640
So our Mr Fox had to wait and wait for days and days until his plump little tummy turned thin once more…and he could
climb back out through the hole of the tree again and off in search of food.

1909
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:12,600
Which just goes to show – that if you wait long enough – the
problem might go away.

1910
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:16,760
And what happened to old Mr Tom Cobbler that day?

1911
02:58:16,760 --> 02:58:26,440
Well, Mrs Tom Cobbler wasn't happy at all that he'd lost the Sunday roast - so he had turnip soup and potato peel pie
instead!

1912
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:28,120
THE RAT AND THE ELEPHANT

1913
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:39,880
A Rat was walking through the city.

1914
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:51,320
He was a very proud Rat who believed that he was the most
frightening animal alive.

1915
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:55,000
"Oh, yes!" said the Rat to himself.

1916
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,360
"Everyone's scared of me."

1917
02:58:57,360 --> 02:59:01,960
"Scary Rat coming through. Out of my way."

1918
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:08,080
The Rat turned a corner and saw a crowd of people standing
by the side of the road.

1919
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:10,000
"Brilliant," thought the rat.

1920
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,560
"I do like a crowd."

1921
02:59:12,560 --> 02:59:20,560
He jumped out into the middle of the road right in front of the crowd and waited for the first scream... but there
wasn't one.

1922
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:23,560
Everybody was staring up the road.

1923
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:26,400
Nobody even noticed the Rat.

1924
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:29,960
"Look everybody," said the Rat.

1925
02:59:29,960 --> 02:59:32,720
"Over here. Rat. See."

1926
02:59:32,760 --> 02:59:34,160
Nothing happened.

1927
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:38,640
The people were all too busy looking up the road.

1928
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:41,520
"This is ridiculous," said the Rat.

1929
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:45,240
"Are you all blind? Can't you see me?"

1930
02:59:45,240 --> 02:59:47,600
Then the Rat saw what the people were looking at.

1931
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:52,120
An elephant was coming down the road.

1932
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:58,760
Sitting on the elephant's back and stroking a large white
cat rode the King.

1933
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:00,840
"Wow," said a man.

1934
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:04,640
"Just look at the size of that elephant!"

1935
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:08,600
"Never mind the elephant," said the Rat.

1936
03:00:08,600 --> 03:00:11,960
"What about me. Look at me. I'm a scary rat."

1937
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:16,880
"Yes look at its wonderful long trunk," said a woman.

1938
03:00:16,920 --> 03:00:21,800
"That's just its nose," said the Rat.

1939
03:00:21,800 --> 03:00:23,160
"I've got a nose."

1940
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:26,160
"And its huge ears," said a little girl.

1941
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:31,760
"I've got ears," said the Rat, jumping up and down.

1942
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:33,320
But nobody was listening.

1943
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:37,680
They were too busy admiring the enormous elephant.

1944
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:41,880
"That is the most wonderful creature in the whole world,"
they all said.

1945
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:45,520
"No...no!" said the Rat.

1946
03:00:45,520 --> 03:01:09,480
"There's nothing wonderful about elephants. How many legs have they got? Four like me. How many eyes have they got?
Two like me. What colour are they? Grey like me. See, I'm exactly the same as an elephant except an elephant's really slow and boring and I'm truly the most fierce and terrifying creature in the world."

1947
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:14,120
But nobody noticed the Rat... ...apart from the King's Cat.

1948
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:22,640
"Look at me...look at me. I'm exactly like an elephant "cept
better.

1949
03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:24,120
Elephant's are rubbish.

1950
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:26,400
I am the most fierce and..."

1951
03:01:26,400 --> 03:01:30,000
The Rat didn't finish what he was saying because...

1952
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:36,720
...in an instant the white cat had run down the elephant's
trunk and was staring the Rat in the face.

1953
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:44,600
"Exactly like an elephant, eh?" said the Cat looking down at
the Rat.

1954
03:01:44,640 --> 03:01:54,560
"Well maybe not exactly," said the Rat looking nervously at
the cat's sharp claws.

1955
03:01:54,600 --> 03:02:03,160
"Obviously my nose isn't quite as long...my ears are a bit
smaller...and I haven't got a king riding on my back…"

1956
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:06,600
Suddenly the Cat's paw flashed out and pinned the Rat to the
ground.

1957
03:02:06,600 --> 03:02:08,320
The Rat couldn't move.

1958
03:02:08,360 --> 03:02:13,960
"Think I could do this to an elephant?" said the Cat.

1959
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:17,480
"Um...not sure," said the Rat.

1960
03:02:17,480 --> 03:02:25,200
The Cat scooped up the Rat and held him up to her mouth.

1961
03:02:25,200 --> 03:02:29,600
"Think I could do this to an elephant?" said the Cat.

1962
03:02:29,640 --> 03:02:34,440
"No, maybe not," said the Rat shaking in fear.

1963
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:42,240
"Think I could eat an elephant in two seconds flat?" asked
the Cat.

1964
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:44,920
"Nope," whispered the Rat.

1965
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:53,520
"Look what I've found," said the Cat to the people putting
the terrified Rat back down on the ground.

1966
03:02:53,520 --> 03:03:00,400
The Rat was shaking and looked so small and scared that
people weren't at all frightened of him.

1967
03:03:00,440 --> 03:03:02,600
"What is it?" said a man.

1968
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:07,040
"Sort of mouse I think," said his wife.

1969
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:09,240
"Funny little mouse thing probably."

1970
03:03:09,240 --> 03:03:26,120
As he slunk away the Rat heard the Cat say "A rat and an elephant may be the same colour but that doesn't make them
the same size. You remember that...Mr Rat."

1971
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:30,800
And the Rat did remember that.

1972
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:32,800
For ever.

1973
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:36,480
THE ANT AND THE DOVE

1974
03:03:36,480 --> 03:03:52,000
It was another hot, dry day in the forest…

1975
03:03:52,040 --> 03:04:03,840
Ant had been wandering over crinkly, dry leaves for days in
search of a nice, cool drink…

1976
03:04:03,880 --> 03:04:14,880
"All I need is a drop of rain falling from a leaf – or a tiny pool of dew on a flower petal – or even a muddy
puddle…" he thought.

1977
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:21,320
But it was so hot all the dew and puddles in the forest had
dried up.

1978
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:26,960
"I'm so thirsty, that I have no choice," Ant sighed at last.

1979
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:29,920
"I shall have to go in search of the Roaring River."

1980
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:34,080
Ant had been warned about the Roaring River.

1981
03:04:34,120 --> 03:04:42,320
"It roars and it swirls and if you go too close, it will
sweep you away," a wise owl had told him.

1982
03:04:42,320 --> 03:04:44,360
But Ant was desperate.

1983
03:04:44,360 --> 03:04:50,960
"The river has more drops of water than all the rain clouds
in the world," he thought.

1984
03:04:50,960 --> 03:04:53,480
"It's my only hope of staying alive."

1985
03:04:53,480 --> 03:04:54,800
So Ant headed off.

1986
03:04:54,800 --> 03:05:02,360
He plodded on and on through the trees, until finally, he
heard rushing water ahead…

1987
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:10,200
Before him lay the Roaring River – as vast as a sea, or so
it seemed to tiny Ant.

1988
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:16,720
The fast flowing waters looked frightening – but Ant was too
thirsty to feel fear…

1989
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:23,080
He clambered down the river bank and bent his weary head
into the water to drink it up.

1990
03:05:23,080 --> 03:05:31,160
The cool, sparkling water was so refreshing that Ant didn't
hear a roaring wave coming towards him…

1991
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:41,200
Suddenly, he was flat on his back - his little legs in the
air, being swept away by the water!

1992
03:05:41,240 --> 03:05:43,400
"Help!" he cried.

1993
03:05:43,400 --> 03:05:45,800
"Someone save me, please!"

1994
03:05:45,840 --> 03:05:50,600
All of a sudden, a green leaf dropped onto the water by his
side with a plop.

1995
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:55,160
"Quick, climb on!" cried a gentle cooing voice.

1996
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:59,800
Ant didn't have time to see who the voice belonged to.

1997
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:03,240
He just did what it told him…then he opened his eyes and
looked up.

1998
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:09,080
Perching on the branch of a tree above was a pure white
Dove.

1999
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:17,640
"Stay calm, little Ant - and wait for the gentle breeze to
blow the leaf to the river bank," she cooed.

2000
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:19,320
Sure enough, the leaf carried Ant to safety.

2001
03:06:19,320 --> 03:06:25,400
He looked up – but the Dove had disappeared.

2002
03:06:25,400 --> 03:06:30,720
"I can't leave without thanking her," he thought.

2003
03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:33,840
"So I shall wait until she returns."

2004
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:35,600
Ant waited and waited.

2005
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:41,160
Then, just as he was about to fall asleep, he heard strange
noises.

2006
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:43,440
They were coming closer and closer…

2007
03:06:43,440 --> 03:06:49,200
Two men emerged from the forest and stopped under the Dove's
tree.

2008
03:06:49,360 --> 03:06:54,040
One was carrying a bucket – the other a large, golden cage.

2009
03:06:54,040 --> 03:07:03,360
"This is the tree – the home of the most beautiful dove in
the land," said the man with the cage.

2010
03:07:03,360 --> 03:07:07,400
"I hope that glue in your bucket is sticky enough…"

2011
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:13,800
"Indeed it is," said the second as he covered the branch
with a thick, green paste.

2012
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:22,560
"When the Dove lands, its feet will stick to the branch – then we can put it in the cage and take it to the King. All
we have to do is hide and wait…"

2013
03:07:22,560 --> 03:07:23,960
Ant was horrified.

2014
03:07:23,960 --> 03:07:29,520
"I can't let this happen!" he thought.

2015
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:35,040
"But what can a tiny creature like me do against two such
giants of men?"

2016
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:38,320
Ant looked up as he heard the flapping of wings.

2017
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:43,360
The Dove had returned and was about to land on the sticky
branch…!

2018
03:07:43,360 --> 03:07:48,480
"If I'm going to act, I must use the only weapon I have…"
thought Ant.

2019
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:50,560
"And I must do it RIGHT NOW!"

2020
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:57,400
So he jumped onto the men's feet – and bit as hard as he
could…time and time again…

2021
03:07:57,480 --> 03:08:03,280
"Yow!!!" they cried out in pain and took to their heels
through the forest.

2022
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:10,760
"Thank you for saving me from a life in a cage," cooed the
Dove to Ant.

2023
03:08:10,760 --> 03:08:17,600
"And thank you for saving me from the giant wave," replied
Ant.

2024
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:19,600
THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF

2025
03:08:19,600 --> 03:08:31,160
A young boy got a job with a shepherd.

2026
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:40,880
"Just keep your eyes open and look out for wolves" said the
shepherd.

2027
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:48,720
"Wolves always try to eat my sheep. If you see one, ring
this bell and shout out "Wolf..!

2028
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:50,200
Wolf..!"

2029
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:53,320
Then we'll come running with our guns.

2030
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:55,440
Can you do that, boy?"

2031
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:58,000
"Don't you worry Mr Shepherd," said the boy.

2032
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,800
"Your sheep are safe with me."

2033
03:09:00,800 --> 03:09:05,200
The boy took the sheep up into the hills and sat down with
his bell.

2034
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:07,720
"Don't worry sheep," he said.

2035
03:09:07,720 --> 03:09:12,760
"I'm here now. I'm in charge. You'll be safe with me."

2036
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:17,920
All morning the boy sat in the grass looking for wolves.

2037
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:22,600
"I expect they're hiding," he said to the sheep.

2038
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:25,720
That night the boy took the sheep back to the village.

2039
03:09:25,720 --> 03:09:31,400
The shepherd counted his sheep and was very pleased.

2040
03:09:31,480 --> 03:09:33,200
"Well done," he said.

2041
03:09:33,200 --> 03:09:36,480
"All safe. Same again tomorrow?"

2042
03:09:36,480 --> 03:09:39,800
"Yes sir!" said the boy.

2043
03:09:39,800 --> 03:09:42,680
The next day was exactly the same as the first day.

2044
03:09:42,720 --> 03:09:54,960
The boy took the sheep to the hills and sat down with his
bell looking for wolves.

2045
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:56,200
There weren't any.

2046
03:09:56,240 --> 03:10:00,000
The boy noticed that the day felt very long.

2047
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:12,520
There was no-one to talk to...except sheep...and the sheep
never talked back...they just ate grass...all day...

2048
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:18,720
By the fifth day the boy was very bored with his job.

2049
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:22,200
He looked up at the mountains.

2050
03:10:22,240 --> 03:10:24,040
Not a wolf in sight.

2051
03:10:24,040 --> 03:10:29,360
He looked down at the bell and he thought: "Maybe I could
just pretend there's a wolf."

2052
03:10:29,360 --> 03:10:42,480
So he picked up his bell... ...and rang it, shouting "Wolf...wolf... ...hurry...come quickly...there's a big old
wolf coming!"

2053
03:10:42,520 --> 03:10:45,120
Soon he could hear the sound of men running up the hill.

2054
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:49,360
"Where is it?" said the shepherd.

2055
03:10:49,360 --> 03:10:52,400
"Gone," said the boy.

2056
03:10:52,560 --> 03:10:57,080
"He just ran off." "Well done boy," said the shepherd.

2057
03:10:57,080 --> 03:11:07,160
"You saved my sheep." The other men all patted the boy on the head and said how brave he'd been and what a good job
he'd done.

2058
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:14,640
The boy felt so proud and pleased with himself that he
almost forgot that he'd made the whole thing up.

2059
03:11:14,640 --> 03:11:17,880
A few days later he was bored again.

2060
03:11:17,880 --> 03:11:25,720
"The only good day I had in this job was when I pretended
there was a wolf," he told the sheep.

2061
03:11:25,720 --> 03:11:31,800
"And I rang my bell and all the men came and told me what a
good job I'd done. It was brilliant."

2062
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:33,080
He looked at his bell.

2063
03:11:33,080 --> 03:11:36,200
And that's when he decided to do it again.

2064
03:11:36,200 --> 03:11:42,520
He rang, he shouted and again the men came running.

2065
03:11:42,520 --> 03:11:45,280
"Where is it?" said the shepherd.

2066
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:47,560
"Gone," said the boy.

2067
03:11:47,560 --> 03:11:53,720
"Ran away." This time the men didn't say "well done" and pat
him on the head.

2068
03:11:53,720 --> 03:11:57,360
This time they looked at the boy like they didn't believe
him.

2069
03:11:57,360 --> 03:11:59,560
"There was a wolf, honest," he said.

2070
03:11:59,560 --> 03:12:04,240
The men just walked back to the village without speaking.

2071
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:07,680
Now the boy felt really sorry for himself.

2072
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:12,200
"They know I rang my bell when there was no wolf."

2073
03:12:12,200 --> 03:12:23,840
Then out of the corner of his eye he saw a movement - a big grey thing was coming down the hillside heading straight for
the sheep.

2074
03:12:23,840 --> 03:12:26,640
The boy rang his bell and he shouted.

2075
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:31,280
"Wolf...wolf...come quickly... ...there's a wolf!"

2076
03:12:31,280 --> 03:12:36,000
Down in the village the men heard the bell ring and just
carried on working.

2077
03:12:36,080 --> 03:12:39,240
"Little fool," said the Shepherd.

2078
03:12:39,240 --> 03:12:43,040
"Does he really think we'll fall for that again?"

2079
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:45,000
The boy kept ringing his bell.

2080
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:52,760
There were tears in his eyes as he watched the wolf make a
meal of one of the shepherd's fattest sheep.

2081
03:12:52,760 --> 03:13:00,400
"I rang my bell but nobody came," the boy told the shepherd
that evening.

2082
03:13:00,400 --> 03:13:15,880
The shepherd nodded "Nobody believes a liar...even when he's
speaking the truth."
