1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,229
At
five o'clock on a September afternoon Ronald

2
00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:11,320
Torbay was making preparations for his third
murder.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,780
He was being very careful.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,850
He realized that murdering people becomes
more dangerous if you do it often.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,450
He was in the bathroom of the house that he
had recently rented.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,630
For a moment he paused to look in the mirror.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,190
The face that looked back at him was thin,
middle-aged and pale.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,920
Dark hair, a high forehead and well-shaped
blue eyes.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,339
Only the mouth was unusual - narrow and quite
straight.

10
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:49,480
Even Ronald Torbay did not like his own mouth.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,059
A sound in the kitchen below worried him.

12
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,680
Was Edyth coming up to have her bath before
he had prepared it for her?

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,730
No, it was all right; she was going out of
the back door.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,030
From the window he saw her disappearing round
the side of the house into the small square

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,040
garden.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,950
It was exactly like all the other gardens
in the long street.

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,039
He didn't like her to be alone there.

18
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:23,979
She was a shy person, but now new people had
moved into the house next door, and there

19
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,229
was a danger of some silly woman making friends
with her.

20
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,729
He didn't want that just now.

21
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:32,729
***

22
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,240
Each of his three marriages had followed the
same pattern.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,530
Using a false name, he had gone on holiday
to a place where no one knew him.

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:49,539
There he had found a middle-aged, unattractive
woman, with some money of her own and no family.

25
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,409
He had talked her into marrying him, and she
had then agreed to make a will which left

26
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,310
him all her money.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,399
Both his other wives had been shy, too.

28
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,689
He was very careful to choose the right type
of woman: someone who would not make friends

29
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,210
quickly in a new place.

30
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:15,560
Mary, the first of them, had had her deadly
'accident' almost unnoticed, in the bathroom

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,750
of the house he had rented - a house very
like this one, but in the north of England

32
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,950
instead of the south.

33
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,150
The police had not found anything wrong.

34
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,159
The only person who was interested was a young
reporter on the local newspaper.

35
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,870
He had written something about death in the
middle of happiness, and had printed photographs

36
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:45,950
of Mary's wedding and her funeral, which took
place only three weeks after the wedding.

37
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,280
Dorothy had given him a little more trouble.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,920
It was not true that she was completely alone
in the world, as she had told him.

39
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,080
Her brother had appeared at the funeral, and
asked difficult questions about her money.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,580
There had been a court case, but Ronald had
won it, and the insurance company had paid

41
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,810
him the money.

42
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,310
All that was four years ago.

43
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:19,390
Now, with a new name, a newly invented background,
and a different area to work in, he felt quite

44
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,800
safe.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,879
From the moment he saw Edyth, sitting alone
at a little table in the restaurant of a seaside

46
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,010
hotel, he knew she was his next 'subject'.

47
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,730
He could see from her face that she was not
happy.

48
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,819
And he could also see that she was wearing
a valuable ring.

49
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,430
After dinner he spoke to her.

50
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,260
She did not want to talk at first, but in
the end he managed to start a conversation.

51
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,040
After that, everything went as he expected.

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,140
His methods were old-fashioned and romantic,
and by the end of a week she was in love with

53
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,360
him.

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,469
Her background was very suitable for Ronald's
purpose.

55
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:12,629
After teaching at a girls' school for ten
years, she had gone home to look after her

56
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,970
sick father and had stayed with him until
he died.

57
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,100
Now, aged forty-three, she was alone, with
a lot of money, and she didn't know what to

58
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,090
do with herself.

59
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:34,370
Five weeks after they met, Ronald married
her, in the town where they were both strangers.

60
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,340
The same afternoon they both made a will leaving
all their property to each other.

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,220
Then they moved into the house which he had
rented cheaply because the holiday season

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,120
was at an end.

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,990
It was the most pleasant of his marriages.

64
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,360
He found Edyth a cheerful person, and even
quite sensible - except that it was stupid

65
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,710
of her to believe that a man would fall in
love with her at first sight.

66
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,830
Ronald knew he must not make the mistake of
feeling sorry for her.

67
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,809
He began to make plans for 'her future', as
he called it.

68
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:14,809
***

69
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:18,270
Two things made him do this earlier than he
intended.

70
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,560
One was the way she refused to talk about
her money.

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,419
She kept all her business papers locked in
a desk drawer, and refused to discuss them.

72
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,750
His other worry was her unnecessary interest
in his job.

73
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,060
Ronald had told Edyth that he was a partner
in an engineering company, which was giving

74
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,979
him a long period of absence.

75
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:49,789
Edyth accepted the story, but she asked a
lot of questions and wanted to visit his office

76
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,840
and the factory.

77
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,069
So Ronald had decided that it was time to
act.

78
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,250
He turned from the window, and began to run
water into the bath.

79
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,370
His heart was beating loudly, he noticed.

80
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,039
He didn't like that.

81
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,840
He needed to keep very calm.

82
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,280
The bathroom was the only room they had painted.

83
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,800
He had done it himself soon after they arrived.

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,770
He had also put up the little shelf over the
bath which held their bottles and creams and

85
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,560
a small electric heater.

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:34,880
It was a cheap one, with two bars, and it
was white, like the walls, and not too noticeable.

87
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,770
There was no electric point in the bathroom,
but he was able to connect the heater to a

88
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,750
point just outside the door.

89
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,710
He turned on the heater now, and watched the
bars become red and hot.

90
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,550
Then he went out of the room.

91
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,470
The controls for all the electricity in the
house were inside a cupboard at the top of

92
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,449
the stairs.

93
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:04,419
Ronald opened the door carefully and pulled
up the handle which turned off the electricity.

94
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:10,979
(He had a cloth over his hand, so that he
would not leave fingerprints.)

95
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:16,220
Back in the bathroom the bars of the heater
were turning black again.

96
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,740
Still using the cloth, he lifted the heater
from the shelf and put it into the bath water,

97
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,440
at the bottom end of the bath.

98
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,150
Of course, you could still see it.

99
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,930
It looked as if it had fallen off the shelf
by accident.

100
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,500
Edyth was coming back from the garden: he
could hear her moving something outside the

101
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,830
kitchen door.

102
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,380
He pulled a small plastic bottle out of his
pocket and began to read again the directions

103
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,620
on the back.

104
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,590
A small sound behind him made him turn suddenly.

105
00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:00,380
There was Edyth's head, only two metres away,
appearing above the flat roof of the kitchen

106
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,949
which was below the bathroom window.

107
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,820
She was clearing the dead leaves from the
edge of the roof.

108
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,039
She must be standing on the ladder which was
kept outside the kitchen door.

109
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,770
He stayed calm.

110
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,910
'What are you doing there, dear?'

111
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,220
Edyth was so surprised that she nearly fell
off the ladder.

112
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,680
'Oh, you frightened me!

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,330
I thought I'd just do this little job before
I came to get ready.'

114
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,900
'But I'm preparing your beauty bath tor you.'

115
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,080
'It's kind of you to take all this trouble,
Ronald.'

116
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
'Not at all.

117
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,230
I'm taking you out tonight and I want you
to look as nice as - er - possible.

118
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,910
Hurry up, dear.

119
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,800
The bubbles don't last very long, and like
all these beauty treatments, this one's expensive.

120
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,910
Go and undress now, and come straight here.'

121
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,730
'Very well, dear.'

122
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,080
She began to climb down the ladder.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,970
Ronald opened the little bottle, and poured
the liquid into the bath.

124
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,820
He turned on the water again, and in a moment
the bath was lull of bubbles, smelling strongly

125
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,780
of roses.

126
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,490
They covered the little heater completely;
they even covered the sides of the bath.

127
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,470
Edyth was at the door.

128
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,470
'Oh Ronald!

129
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,770
It's all over everything - even on the floor!'

130
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,260
'That doesn't matter.

131
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,580
You get in quickly, before it loses its strength.

132
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,570
I'll go and change now.

133
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,040
Get straight in and lie down.

134
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,810
It will give your skin a bit of color!'

135
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,310
He went out and paused, listening.

136
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,700
She locked the door, as he expected.

137
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,970
He walked slowly to the electricity box, and
forced himself to wait another minute.

138
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,070
'How is it?' he shouted.

139
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,070
'I don't know yet.

140
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,130
I've only just got into the bath.

141
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,010
It smells nice.'

142
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,440
His hand, covered with the cloth, was on the
controls.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:28,840
'One, two... three,' he said, and pulled the
handle down.

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,000
A small explosion from the electric point
behind him told him that the electricity had

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
gone off.

146
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,830
Then everything was silent.

147
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,650
After a time he went and knocked on the bathroom
door.

148
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,810
'Edyth?'

149
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,940
There was no answer, no sound, nothing.

150
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,380
Now he had to prepare the second stage.

151
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,940
As he knew well, this was the difficult bit.

152
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,180
The discovery of the body must be made, but
not too soon.

153
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,810
He had made that mistake with Dorothy's 'accident',
and the police had asked him why he had got

154
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,760
worried so soon.

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,720
This time he decided to wait half an hour
before he began to knock loudly on the bathroom

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,640
door, then to shout for a neighbour and finally
to force the lock.

157
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,820
There was something he wanted to do now.

158
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,700
Edyth's leather writing-case, which contained
all her private papers, was in the drawer

159
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,510
where she kept her blouses.

160
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,060
He had discovered it some time ago, but he
had not forced the lock open because that

161
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,230
would frighten her.

162
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,490
Now there was nothing to stop him.

163
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,760
He went softly into the bedroom and opened
the drawer.

164
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,600
The case was there.

165
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,900
The lock was more difficult than he expected,
but he finally managed to open the case.

166
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:12,780
Inside there were some financial documents,
one or two thick envelopes and, on top of

167
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,250
these, her Post Office Savings book.

168
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:26,140
He opened it with shaking fingers, and began
reading the figures - 17,000...

169
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,420
18,600...

170
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,700
21,940...

171
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,500
He turned over a page, and his heart jumped
wildly.

172
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,430
On 4th September she had taken almost all
the money out of her savings account!

173
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,310
Perhaps it was here, in these thick envelopes?

174
00:12:53,310 --> 00:13:00,330
He opened one of them; papers, letters, documents
fell on the floor.

175
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:07,860
Suddenly he saw an envelope with his own name
on it, in Edyth's writing.

176
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:15,440
He pulled it open, and saw in surprise that
the date on the letter was only two days ago.

177
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,950
Dear Ronald,

178
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:25,030
If you ever read this, I am afraid it will
be a terrible shock to you.

179
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,891
I hoped it would not be necessary to write
it, but now your behaviour has forced me to

180
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,610
face some very unpleasant possibilities.

181
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:41,270
Did you not realize, Ronald, that any middle-aged
woman who has been rushed into marriage to

182
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:48,070
a stranger will ask herself about her husband's
reason for marrying her?

183
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:54,830
At first I thought I was in love with you,
but when you asked me to make my will on our

184
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,970
wedding day, I began to worry.

185
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,980
And then, when you started making changes
to the bathroom in this house, I decided to

186
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,980
act quickly.

187
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,930
So I went to the police.

188
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:15,000
Have you noticed that the people who have
moved into the house next door have never

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,460
spoken to you?

190
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:24,580
Well, they are not a husband and wife, but
a police inspector and a policewoman.

191
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:31,430
The policewoman showed me two pieces from
old newspapers, both about women who had died

192
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,010
from accidents in their baths soon after their
marriages.

193
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,550
Both pieces included a photograph of the husband
at the funeral.

194
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,700
They were not very clear, but I was able to
recognize you.

195
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,920
So I realized that it was my duty to agree
to do what the inspector asked me to do.

196
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,240
(The police have been looking for the man
since the photographs were given to them by

197
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,550
your second wife's brother.)

198
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:07,250
The inspector said the police needed to be
sure that you were guilty: you must be given

199
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,410
the opportunity to try the crime again.

200
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:17,800
That's why I am forcing myself to be brave,
and to play my part.

201
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,290
I want to tell you something, Ronald.

202
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:28,680
If one day you lose me, out of the bathroom,
I mean, you will find that I have gone out

203
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,290
over the kitchen roof, and am sitting in the
kitchen next door.

204
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:41,960
I was stupid to marry you, but not quite as
stupid as you thought.

205
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,940
Yours, Edyth

206
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,420
Ronald's mouth was uglier than ever when he
finished reading the letter.

207
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,180
The house was still quiet.

208
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:01,100
But in the silence he heard the back door
open suddenly, and heavy footsteps rushed

209
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,120
up the stairs towards him.

210
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,190
- THE END -
