1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:14,370
Women often knit gifts for their families.

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:25,970
Wives knit socks or scarves for their husbands;
grandmothers knit little jackets for their

3
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,070
children's babies.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:40,780
Buying a gift is quick and easy, but making
a gift with your own hands takes longer.

5
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:50,820
And if, like Leonard's wife, your hands are
old and stiff and crooked with arthritis,

6
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,400
perhaps knitting is not the best thing to
do...

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:05,710
I'll knit him a scarf.

8
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,030
Yes.

9
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:25,700
I'll knit him a scarf the same colour as his
eyes.

10
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,820
I wait until my niece takes me shopping.

11
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,409
'I want to buy some wool,' I tell her.

12
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,670
'I want to knit Leonard a scarf.'

13
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:47,380
'But you don't knit,' she says.

14
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,070
She looks at my crooked hands and quickly
looks away again.

15
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,619
'And Leonard doesn't go out any more.'

16
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:06,000
But Petra takes me to the wool shop anyway.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,809
'I want to buy some blue wool,' I say to the
woman in the shop.

18
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:18,439
'The colour of my husband's eyes.'

19
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:26,970
I touch a ball of blue wool that feels as
soft as a bird's feathers.

20
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:35,799
'Isn't this a little too fine?' asks the woman
in the shop.

21
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,109
'No, it's just right.'

22
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:51,900
Later, tired after my shopping, I lie back
in my armchair and have a little sleep.

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:06,239
When the car stops outside, I am still half-asleep,
and in my mind, I see a younger Leonard standing

24
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,769
at the door.

25
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:18,310
His back is as straight as a piece of wood,
and his blue eyes smile.

26
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,559
'Is anyone home?'

27
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,719
Dan calls.

28
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,069
I wake with a jump.

29
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:34,559
'Here we are, Mr Phipps,' Dan says to Leonard.

30
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:41,420
Holding Leonard's arm, Dan walks him into
the house.

31
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,560
'Thank you, Dan.'

32
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,569
I take off Leonard's coat and push some hair
away from his eyes.

33
00:03:52,569 --> 00:04:00,150
We eat dinner in a silence that aches.

34
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:09,519
I drink red wine and Leonard eats with a spoon.

35
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:18,630
Then, after I've washed him and put him to
bed, I sit down to knit.

36
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,590
The needles are silver.

37
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,550
The needles are cold.

38
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:38,819
I take the paper cover off the wool, find
one end of it, and try again and again to

39
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,400
make the first stitch.

40
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:51,919
I am listening to music by Beethoven, and
it is nearly halfway through before I have

41
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,220
finished the first row of stitches.

42
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,680
My fingers hurt, and they won't do what I
tell them.

43
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,610
But I have begun.

44
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,460
Leonard and I met at a concert in Auckland.

45
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,460
He was tall, with blond hair then.

46
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:25,120
I can still see him walking towards my seat.

47
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:35,970
He took off the soft blue scarf that was the
same colour as his eyes, and my heart gave

48
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,219
a little jump.

49
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:47,129
We talked over supper, and I found out where
he lived and what he did.

50
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:54,250
'I'm an eye doctor,' he said, 'just beginning.

51
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,259
No money, but I never miss concerts.'

52
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:09,199
I made our first date while we were walking
out of the concert building.

53
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:17,280
In those days, men always did the asking,
not girls.

54
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:26,110
I don't know if Leonard was surprised at my
asking him or not.

55
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,030
He never said anything.

56
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:39,740
On the days when Leonard goes to the day-care
centre, I knit.

57
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:49,580
I plan to finish the scarf for our fifty-third
wedding anniversary.

58
00:06:49,580 --> 00:07:00,120
The scarf is almost finished, and when I hold
it to the light, diamonds shine through.

59
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:08,900
I shake the wool, drop a stitch, try to find
it again.

60
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:16,610
Was I more in love with Leonard than he was
with me?

61
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:26,719
I have so many questions... and I cannot ask
any of them now.

62
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:35,129
'It's finished,' I tell my niece, putting
the scarf round my neck.

63
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:44,630
'It looks good,' she said, 'if you don't look
too closely.

64
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:51,249
Is it a gift?'

65
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:52,319
'Yes.

66
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
My last.'

67
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:03,961
On the morning of our anniversary, I kiss
Leonard and give him the scarf.

68
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:13,120
I know he will not speak, but while I am putting
the scarf round his neck, I find that I am

69
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,560
still hoping.

70
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:23,229
The scarf is as crooked as my fingers.

71
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:34,330
It's full of holes - long thin holes, little
round holes.

72
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:47,600
Leonard puts his hand up and touches the wool,
and for one short moment, his eyes come alive

73
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,449
again.

74
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:55,460
'Yes,' he wants to tell me.

75
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,540
'Yes,' he wants to say.

76
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,600
'The scarf is soft.

77
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,420
The scarf is blue.

78
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,639
The scarf is us.'

79
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,980
- THE END -
