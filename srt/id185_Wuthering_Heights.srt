CHAPTER ONE
Mr Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,320
I have just returned from a visit to my landlord,
Mr Heathcliff.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,160
I am delighted with the house I am renting
from him.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,050
Thrushcross Grange is miles away from any
town or village.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,340
That suits me perfectly.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,900
And the scenery here in Yorkshire is so beautiful!

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,930
Mr Heathcliff, in fact, is my only neighbour,
and I think his character is similar to mine.

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,739
He does not like people either.

9
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,440
'My name is Lockwood,' I said, when I met
him at the gate to his house.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,069
'I'm renting Thrushcross Grange from you.

11
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:54,739
I just wanted to come and introduce myself.'

12
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:00,780
He said nothing, but frowned, and did not
encourage me to enter.

13
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,750
After a while, however, he decided to invite
me in.

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:11,000
'Joseph, take Mr Lockwood's horse!' he called.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,210
'And bring up some wine from the cellar!'

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,520
Joseph was a very old servant, with a sour
expression on his face.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,600
He looked crossly up at me as he took my horse.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,480
'God help us!

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,240
A visitor!' he muttered to himself.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,000
Perhaps there were no other servants, I thought.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,860
And it seemed that Mr Heathcliff hardly ever
received guests.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,630
His house is called Wuthering Heights.

23
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,970
The name means 'a windswept house on a hill',
and it is a very good description.

24
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,950
The trees around the house do not grow straight,
but are bent by the north wind, which blows

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,659
over the moors every day of the year.

26
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,670
Fortunately, the house is strongly built,
and is not damaged even by the worst winter

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,910
storms.

28
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:17,200
The name 'Earnshaw' is cut into a stone over
the front door.

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,170
Mr Heathcliff and I entered the huge main
room.

30
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,640
It could have been any Yorkshire farmhouse
kitchen, except that there was no sign of

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,070
cooking, and no farmer sitting at the table.

32
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,480
Mr Heathcliff certainly does not look like
a farmer.

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,890
His hair and skin are dark, like a gipsy's,
but he has the manners of a gentleman.

34
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,800
He could perhaps take more care with his appearance,
but he is handsome.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
I think he is proud, and also unhappy.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,950
We sat down by the fire, in silence.

37
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,120
'Joseph!'

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,610
shouted Mr Heathcliff.

39
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,510
No answer came from the cellar, so he dived
down there, leaving me alone with several

40
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,020
rather fierce-looking dogs.

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,319
Suddenly one of them jumped angrily up at
me, and in a moment all the others were attacking

42
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,740
me.

43
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,690
From every shadowy corner in the great room
appeared a growling animal, ready to kill

44
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,760
me, it seemed.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,780
'Help!

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,820
Mr Heathcliff!

47
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,849
Help!'

48
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,370
I shouted, trying to keep the dogs back.

49
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,849
My landlord and his servant were in no hurry
to help, and could not have climbed the cellar

50
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:53,270
steps more slowly, but luckily a woman, who
I supposed was the housekeeper, rushed into

51
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,560
the room to calm the dogs.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,209
'What the devil is the matter?'

53
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,410
Mr Heathcliff asked me rudely, when he finally
entered the room.

54
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,240
'Your dogs, sir!'

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I replied.

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,599
'You shouldn't leave a stranger with them.

57
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,700
They're dangerous.'

58
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,400
'Come, come, Mr Lockwood.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,820
Have some wine.

60
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,970
We don't often have strangers here, and I'm
afraid neither I nor my dogs are used to receiving

61
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,930
them.'

62
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,160
I could not feel offended after this, and
accepted the wine.

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,650
We sat drinking and talking together for a
while.

64
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,000
I suggested visiting him tomorrow.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,520
He did not seem eager to see me again, but
I shall go anyway.

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,540
I am interested in him, even if he isn't interested
in me.

67
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:05,520
Two days later Yesterday afternoon was misty
and bitterly cold, but I walked the four miles

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,820
to Wuthering Heights and arrived just as it
was beginning to snow.

69
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:17,270
I banged on the front door for ten minutes,
getting colder and colder.

70
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,180
Finally Joseph's head appeared at a window
of one of the farm buildings.

71
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,810
'What do you want?' he growled.

72
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,810
'Could you let me in?'

73
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,800
I asked desperately.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,250
He shook his head.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:43,440
'There's only Mrs Heathcliff indoors, and
she won't open the door to you.'

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,870
Just then a young man appeared and called
me to follow him.

77
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,440
We went through the back door and into the
big room where I had been before.

78
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,100
I was delighted to see a warm fire and a table
full of food.

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,350
And this time there was a woman sitting by
the fire.

80
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,900
She must be Mrs Heathcliff, I thought.

81
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,350
I had not imagined my landlord was married.

82
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,120
She looked at me coldly without saying anything.

83
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,990
'Terrible weather!'

84
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,370
I remarked.

85
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,330
There was silence.

86
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,470
'What a beautiful animal!'

87
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,600
I tried again, pointing to one of the dogs
that had attacked me.

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,360
She still said nothing, but got up to make
the tea.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,150
She was only about seventeen, with the most
beautiful little face I had ever seen.

90
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,820
Her golden wavy hair fell around her shoulders.

91
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,380
'Have you been invited to tea?'

92
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,350
she asked me crossly.

93
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,979
'No, but you are the proper person to invite
me,' I smiled.

94
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,759
For some reason this really annoyed her.

95
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,580
She stopped making the tea, and threw herself
angrily back in her chair.

96
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,990
Meanwhile the young man was staring aggressively
at me.

97
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,810
He looked like a farm worker, but seemed to
be part of the family.

98
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,500
I did not feel at all comfortable.

99
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,780
At last Heathcliff came in.

100
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,259
'Here I am, sir, as I promised!'

101
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,870
I said cheerfully.

102
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:37,680
'You shouldn't have come,' he answered, shaking
the snow off his clothes.

103
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,199
'You'll never find your way back in the dark.'

104
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,130
'Perhaps you could lend me a servant to guide
me back to the Grange?'

105
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,130
I asked.

106
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,840
'No, I couldn't.

107
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:58,270
There aren't any servants here except Joseph
and the housekeeper.

108
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,850
Get the tea ready, will you?' he added fiercely
to the young woman.

109
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,180
I was shocked by his unpleasantness.

110
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,060
We sat down to eat.

111
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,930
I tried to make conversation with the three
silent people round the table.

112
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:19,110
'How happy you must be, Mr Heathcliff,' I
began, 'in this quiet place, with your wife

113
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,289
and-'

114
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,650
'My wife!

115
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,540
My wife's ghost, you mean?'

116
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,810
I suddenly realized I had made a serious mistake.

117
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,080
So his wife was dead!

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,390
Of course he was too old to be married to
that young girl.

119
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,520
She must be married to the young man next
to me, who was drinking his tea out of a bowl

120
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,700
and eating his bread with unwashed hands.

121
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,680
Perhaps the poor girl had found no one better
to marry in this uninhabited area.

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,500
I turned politely to the young man.

123
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,170
'Ah, so you are this lady's husband!'

124
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,930
This was worse than before.

125
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,720
His face went red, and he seemed only just
able to stop himself hitting me.

126
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,530
He muttered something I could not hear.

127
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:21,680
'Wrong again, Mr Lockwood,' said Mr Heathcliff.

128
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,270
'No, her husband, my son, is dead.

129
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:36,560
This, 'he added', looking scornfully at the
young man, 'is certainly not my son.'

130
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,570
'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' growled the
young man.

131
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,610
We finished our meal in silence, and when
I looked out of the window, all I could see

132
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,290
was darkness and snow.

133
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,770
'I don't think I can get home without a guide,'
I said politely.

134
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,730
No one answered me.

135
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,750
I turned to the woman.

136
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,180
'Mrs Heathcliff,' I begged, 'What can I do?

137
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,720
Please help me!'

138
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,920
'Take the road you came on,' she replied without
interest, opening a book.

139
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,020
'That's the best advice I can give.'

140
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,900
'Mr Heathcliff, I'll have to stay here for
the night!'

141
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,459
I told him.

142
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:33,180
'I hope that will teach you not to walk over
the moors in bad weather,' he answered.

143
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,710
'I don't keep guest bedrooms.

144
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,250
You can share a bed with Hareton or Joseph.'

145
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,370
I was so angry with them all that I could
not stay there a moment longer, and rushed

146
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,420
out into the darkness.

147
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,399
I saw Joseph by the back door, caught hold
of the lamp he was carrying, and ran with

148
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,769
it to the gate.

149
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:03,589
But the dogs chased after me and attacked
me, and I was soon knocked to the ground.

150
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:10,209
Heathcliff and Hareton stood at the door,
laughing, as I shouted at the dogs and tried

151
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,390
to get up.

152
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:18,610
In the end I was again rescued by the housekeeper,
Zillah, who ordered away the dogs and helped

153
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,959
me to my feet.

154
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,899
I was so bruised and exhausted that I did
not feel strong enough to walk home, and although

155
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,480
I did not want to, I had to spend the night
at Wuthering Heights.

156
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:43,560
Nobody wished me goodnight, as Zillah took
me upstairs to find a bed for me.

157
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,041
CHAPTER TWO
Catherine Earnshaw's room

158
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,880
'Quietly, sir!'

159
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,400
whispered the housekeeper, as we climbed up
the dark stairs.

160
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,170
'My master will be angry if he discovers which
bedroom you're sleeping in.

161
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,610
For some reason he doesn't want anyone to
sleep there, I don't know why.

162
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,399
They're strange people in this house, you
know.

163
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,610
Here's the room, sir.'

164
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,370
But I was too tired to listen.

165
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:27,450
'Thank you, Zillah,' I said, and, taking the
candle, I entered the room and closed the

166
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,450
door.

167
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:36,560
The only piece of furniture in the large,
dusty bedroom was a bed, placed next to the

168
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,730
window.

169
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,589
There were heavy curtains which could be pulled
around it, to hide the sleeper from anyone

170
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,670
else in the room.

171
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:54,570
Looking inside the curtains I saw a little
shelf full of books, just under the window.

172
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:02,600
I put my candle down on the shelf, and dropped
thankfully on to the bed.

173
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,470
I closed the curtains around the bed, and
felt safe from Heathcliff and everyone else

174
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,200
at Wuthering Heights.

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I noticed that there were names written on
the wall in childish handwriting - Catherine

176
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,170
Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff and Catherine
Linton.

177
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:34,990
Then I fell asleep, but I was woken very suddenly
by a smell of burning.

178
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,260
My candle had fallen on to a Bible on the
shelf and was burning it.

179
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,610
When I opened the Bible to see if it was damaged,
I found that wherever there was an empty page,

180
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:57,050
or half a page, someone had written on it,
and on the first page was written 'Catherine

181
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,300
Earnshaw's diary, 1776'.

182
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:10,120
Who was the girl who had slept in this bed,
written her name on the wall, and then written

183
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,149
her diary in the Bible, twenty-five years
ago?

184
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:19,180
I read it with interest.

185
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,060
'How I hate my brother Hindley!'

186
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,019
it began.

187
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,690
'He is so cruel to poor Heathcliff.

188
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,690
If only my father hadn't died!

189
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,190
While he was alive, Heathcliff was like a
brother to Hindley and me.

190
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:47,389
But now Hindley and his wife Frances have
inherited the house and the money, and they

191
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,380
hate Heathcliff.

192
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:57,040
That horrible old servant Joseph is always
angry with Heathcliff and me because we don't

193
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:05,700
pray or study the Bible, and when he tells
his master, Hindley always punishes us.

194
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,550
I can't stop crying.

195
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,470
Poor Heathcliff!

196
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:21,020
Hindley says he is wicked, and can't play
with me or eat with me anymore.'

197
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,560
My eyes were beginning to close again and
I fell asleep.

198
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,459
Never before had I passed such a terrible
night, disturbed by the most frightening dreams.

199
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:40,220
Suddenly I was woken by a gentle knocking
on the window.

200
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,589
It must be the branch of a tree, I thought,
and tried to sleep again.

201
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,020
Outside I could hear the wind driving the
snow against the window.

202
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,870
But I could not sleep.

203
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:59,410
The knocking annoyed me so much that I tried
to open the window.

204
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,000
When it did not open, I broke the glass angrily
and stretched out my hand towards the branch.

205
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,620
But instead, my fingers closed around a small,
ice-cold hand!

206
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:21,779
It held my hand tightly, and a voice cried
sadly, 'Let me in!

207
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,870
Let me in!'

208
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,820
'Who are you?'

209
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,080
I asked, trying to pull my hand away.

210
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,160
'Catherine Linton,' it replied.

211
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,030
'I've come home.

212
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,199
I lost my way!'

213
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:49,380
There seemed to be a child's face looking
in at the window.

214
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,250
Terror made me cruel.

215
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:57,839
I rubbed the creature's tiny wrist against
the broken glass so that blood poured down

216
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,490
on to the bed.

217
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:07,350
As soon as the cold fingers let go for a moment,
I pulled my hand quickly back, put a pile

218
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,039
of books in front of the broken window, and
tried not to listen to the desperate cries

219
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,600
outside.

220
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,729
'Go away!'

221
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:19,589
I called.

222
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,079
'I'll never let you in, not if you go on crying
for twenty years!'

223
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,979
'It is almost twenty years!'

224
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:33,529
replied the sad little voice.

225
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:39,239
'I've been out here in the dark for nearly
twenty years!'

226
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:45,539
The hand started pushing through the window
at the pile of books, and I knew it would

227
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,220
find me and catch hold of me again.

228
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,330
Unable to move, I stared in horror at the
shape behind the glass, and screamed.

229
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:05,549
There were rapid footsteps outside my bedroom
door, and then I saw the light of a candle

230
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,380
in the room.

231
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,820
'Is anyone here?'

232
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,779
whispered Heathcliff.

233
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:19,720
He could not see me behind the curtains, and
clearly did not expect an answer.

234
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,200
I knew I could not hide from him, so I opened
the curtains wide.

235
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,989
I was surprised by the effect of my action.

236
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:38,739
Heathcliff dropped his candle and stood without
moving, his face as white as the wall behind

237
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:39,739
him.

238
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:44,289
He did not seem to recognize me.

239
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,399
'It's only your guest, Lockwood,' I said.

240
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:53,429
'I'm sorry, I must have had a bad dream and
screamed in my sleep.'

241
00:18:53,429 --> 00:19:00,350
'To the devil with you, Mr Lockwood!'

242
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,679
growled my landlord.

243
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,799
'Who allowed you to steep in this room?

244
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,120
Who was it?'

245
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,470
'It was your housekeeper, Mr Heathcliff,'
I said, quickly putting my clothes on.

246
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,179
'And I'm angry with her myself!

247
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,299
No one can sleep in a room full of ghosts!'

248
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:29,260
'What do you mean?' asked Heathcliff, looking
suddenly very interested.

249
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,720
'Ghosts, you say?'

250
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:42,710
'That little girl, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw,
or whatever her name was, must have been wicked!

251
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,610
She told me she had been a ghost for nearly
twenty years.

252
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,110
It was probably a punishment for her wickedness!'

253
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,820
'How dare you speak of her to me?'

254
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,570
cried Heathcliff wildly.

255
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:08,099
But as I described my dream, he became calmer,
and sat down on the bed, trembling as he tried

256
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,529
to control his feelings.

257
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:21,619
'Mr Lockwood,' he said finally, brushing a
tear from his eye, 'you can go into my bedroom

258
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:25,809
to sleep for the rest of the night.

259
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,749
I'll stay here for a while.'

260
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:35,889
'No more sleep for me tonight,' I replied.

261
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:41,500
'I'll wait in the kitchen until it's daylight,
and then I'll leave.

262
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,759
You needn't worry about my visiting you again
either.

263
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,779
I've had enough company for a long time.'

264
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:58,250
But as I turned to go downstairs, my landlord,
thinking he was alone, threw himself on the

265
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,599
bed, pushed open the window and called into
the darkness.

266
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,830
'Come in!

267
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:12,039
Come in!' he cried, tears rolling down his
face.

268
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,519
'Catherine, do come!

269
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,450
My darling, hear me this time!'

270
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:29,190
But only the snow and wind blew into the room.

271
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,669
How could my dream have produced such madness?

272
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:39,179
I could not watch his suffering any more,
and went downstairs.

273
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:46,149
I waited in the kitchen until it was light
enough outside for me to find my way through

274
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:50,309
the deep snow back to Thrushcross Grange.

275
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:57,950
The housekeeper there, Ellen Dean, rushed
out to welcome me home.

276
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,869
She thought I must have died in the previous
night's snowstorm.

277
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:12,970
With a warm fire, and a hot meal, I began
to recover from my unpleasant experiences.

278
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,529
After my stay at Wuthering Heights, I thought
I would never want to speak to any human being

279
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:25,039
again, but by the end of the next day I was
beginning to feel lonely.

280
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,399
I decided to ask Mrs Dean to sit with me after
supper.

281
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:35,809
'How long have you lived in this house?'

282
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:37,739
I asked her.

283
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:40,649
'Eighteen years, sir.

284
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:49,419
I came here early in 1783 when my mistress
was married, to look after her.

285
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:53,519
And when she died, I stayed here as housekeeper.'

286
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,820
'Who was your mistress?'

287
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,639
I asked.

288
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:06,059
'Her name was Catherine Earnshaw,' she replied.

289
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:13,729
'Ah, my ghostly Catherine,' I muttered quietly
to myself.

290
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:24,009
'She married Mr Edgar Linton, a neighbour,'
added Mrs Dean, 'and they had a daughter,

291
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:28,599
Cathy, who married Mr Heathcliffs son.'

292
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:36,169
'Ah, so that must be the widow, young Mrs
Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights!'

293
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:38,419
'That's right, sir.

294
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,719
Did you see her?

295
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:45,529
I looked after her as a baby, you know.

296
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,609
How is she?

297
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,400
I do want to know.'

298
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,210
'She looked very well, and very beautiful.

299
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,080
But I don't think she's happy.'

300
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,200
'Oh, poor thing!

301
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,629
And what did you think of Mr Heathcliff?'

302
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:10,639
'He's a rough, hard man, Mrs Dean.

303
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:13,149
But I'm very interested in him.

304
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:16,460
Tell me more about him.'

305
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:23,570
'Well, he's very rich, of course, and mean
at the same time.

306
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:32,090
He could live here at Thrushcross Grange,
which is a finer house than Wuthering Heights,

307
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,219
but he would rather receive rent than live
comfortably.

308
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:46,320
But I'll tell you the whole story of his life,
as much as I know, that is, and then you can

309
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,729
judge for yourself.'

310
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:58,849
CHAPTER THREE
Ellen Dean's story - Catherine and Heathcliff

311
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:09,009
as children
When I was a child, I was always at Wuthering

312
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:14,349
Heights, because my mother was a servant with
the Earnshaw family.

313
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:21,460
They are a very old family who have lived
in that house for centuries, as you can see

314
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,450
from their name on the stone over the front
door.

315
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:34,309
I grew up with Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw,
and we three played together as children.

316
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:40,369
One day, their father Mr Earnshaw came back
from a long journey.

317
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:48,519
He had travelled sixty miles to Liverpool
and back on business, and was very tired.

318
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,059
'Look what I've brought you!' he told us all,
unwrapping something he was holding carefully

319
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,759
in his arms.

320
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:03,229
Catherine and Hindley were expecting presents,
and they rushed eagerly to see what it was.

321
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:11,139
They were very disappointed to see only a
dirty, black-haired gipsy child.

322
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:20,129
'I found him all alone in the busy streets
of Liverpool,' Mr Earnshaw explained to them,

323
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,359
and I couldn't leave him to die.

324
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,299
He can sleep in your room.'

325
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:32,229
But Hindley and Catherine were angry because
they had not received any presents, and refused

326
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:36,489
to let the strange child share their room.

327
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:45,340
However Mr Earnshaw insisted, and little by
little the boy became accepted by the family.

328
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,729
He was called Heathcliff, as a first and last
name.

329
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:54,799
No one ever discovered who his parents had
been.

330
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:03,159
Catherine and he became great friends, but
Hindley hated him, and was often cruel to

331
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,159
him.

332
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:12,059
Old Mr Earnshaw was strangely fond of this
gipsy child, and frequently punished his son

333
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,889
for behaving badly to Heathcliff.

334
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:21,349
Hindley began to be jealous of his father's
feelings for Heathcliff, and saw them both

335
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,979
as enemies.

336
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:26,649
This situation could not last.

337
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:34,059
As Mr Earnshaw grew old and ill, Heathcliff
became even more his favourite, and Hindley

338
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:37,739
often quarrelled with his father.

339
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:43,259
When Hindley was sent away to study, I hoped
that we would have peace in the house.

340
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,610
But then it was that old servant Joseph who
caused trouble.

341
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:55,719
He tried to persuade his master to be stricter
with the children, and was always complaining

342
00:27:55,719 --> 00:28:02,239
that Heathcliff and Catherine did not spend
enough time studying the Bible or attending

343
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,119
church services.

344
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:08,120
Catherine was a wild, wicked girl in those
days.

345
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,019
We had to watch her every moment of the day,
to stop her playing her tricks on us.

346
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:17,169
She was proud, and liked giving orders.

347
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:23,870
But she had the prettiest face and the sweetest
smile you've ever seen.

348
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:29,599
I could forgive her anything when she came
to say she was sorry.

349
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:36,830
She was much too fond of Heathcliff, and the
worst punishment we could invent was to keep

350
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,320
her separate from him.

351
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,250
Her father could no longer understand her
or her behaviour, and Catherine did not realize

352
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,489
that his illness made him less patient with
her.

353
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:54,570
At last Mr Earnshaw found peace.

354
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:03,219
He died quietly in his chair by the fire one
October evening in 1775.

355
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:11,219
The night was wild and stormy, and we were
all sitting together in the big kitchen.

356
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:17,219
Joseph was reading his Bible at the table,
while Catherine had her head on her father's

357
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:18,909
knee.

358
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:23,899
He was pleased to see her so gentle for once,
and she was singing him to sleep.

359
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:29,109
I was glad the old gentleman was sleeping
so well.

360
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:35,820
But when it was time to go to bed, Catherine
put her arms round her father's neck to say

361
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:43,860
goodnight, and immediately screamed, 'Oh,
he's dead, Heathcliff!

362
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,940
He's dead!'

363
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:52,000
Heathcliff and I started crying loudly and
bitterly too.

364
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,070
Joseph told me to fetch the doctor, so I ran
to the village, although I knew it was too

365
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,860
late.

366
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,859
When I came back, I went to the children's
room, to see if they needed me, and I listened

367
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:11,190
for a moment at their door.

368
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:18,730
They were imagining the dead man in a beautiful
distant place, far from the troubles of this

369
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,730
world.

370
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:32,820
And as I listened, crying silently, I could
not help wishing we were all there safe together.

371
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,080
CHAPTER FOUR
Catherine Earnshaw gets to know the Lintons

372
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:50,129
1775 Hindley came home for his father's burial.

373
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:55,100
What was more surprising was that he brought
a wife with him.

374
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:03,149
She was called Frances, a thin, pale woman
with a frequent cough.

375
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:09,759
Now that Hindley was the master of the house,
he ordered Joseph and me to spend our evenings

376
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:17,269
in the small back-kitchen, as we were only
servants, while he, his wife and Catherine

377
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:19,229
sat in the main room.

378
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:24,049
Catherine and Heathcliff were treated very
differently.

379
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:31,879
Catherine received presents, and could continue
her lessons, but Heathcliff was made to work

380
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:39,080
on the farm with the men, and, as a farm worker,
was only allowed to eat with us in the back-kitchen.

381
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,159
They grew up like two wild animals.

382
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,989
Hindley did not care what they did, as long
as they kept out of his way, and they did

383
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:53,950
not care even if he punished them.

384
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:00,519
They often ran away on to the moors in the
morning and stayed out all day, just to make

385
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,929
Hindley angry.

386
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:08,979
I was the only one who cared what happened
to the two poor creatures, and I was afraid

387
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:11,529
for them.

388
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:18,539
One Sunday evening they were missing at bedtime,
and Hindley ordered me angrily to lock the

389
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,600
front door.

390
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,990
But I did not want them to stay out in the
cold all night, so I kept my window open to

391
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,549
look out for them.

392
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:34,139
In a while I saw Heathcliff walking through
the gate.

393
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:36,719
I was shocked to see him alone.

394
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,139
'Where's Catherine?'

395
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:40,980
I cried sharply.

396
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,610
'At Thrushcross Grange, with our neighbor's
the Lintons,' he replied.

397
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,109
Let me in, Ellen, and I'll explain what happened.'

398
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:57,029
I went down to unlock the door, and we came
upstairs very quietly.

399
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:59,489
'Don't wake the master up!'

400
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,039
I whispered.

401
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,169
'Now tell me!'

402
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:10,549
'Well, Catherine and I thought we'd just walk
to the Lintons' house.

403
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:17,470
We wanted to see if Isabella and Edgar Linton
are punished all the time by their parents,

404
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,440
as we are.'

405
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,159
'Probably not,' I answered.

406
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,859
'I expect they are good children and don't
need to be punished.'

407
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:26,859
'Nonsense, Ellen!

408
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:32,750
Guess what we saw when we looked in at their
sitting-room window?

409
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,000
A very pretty room, with soft carpets and
white walls.

410
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Catherine and I would love to have a room
like that!

411
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,749
But in the middle of this beautiful room,
Isabella and Edgar Linton were screaming and

412
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:54,870
fighting over a little dog!

413
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,210
How stupid they are, Ellen!

414
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:06,149
If Catherine wanted something, I would give
it to her, and she would do the same for me.

415
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:11,000
I would rather be here at Wuthering Heights
with her, even if I'm punished by Joseph and

416
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,060
that wicked Hindley, than at Thrushcross Grange
with those two fools!'

417
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,419
'Not so loud, Heathcliff!

418
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:25,819
But you still haven't told me why Catherine
isn't with you?'

419
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:35,270
'Well, as we were looking in, we started laughing
at them so loudly that they heard us, and

420
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,980
sent the dogs after us.

421
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,819
We were about to run away, when a great fierce
dog caught Catherine's leg in its teeth.

422
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:53,039
I attacked it, and made it let go of her leg,
but the Lintons' servants appeared and caught

423
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,070
hold of me.

424
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,049
They must have thought we were robbers.

425
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:02,720
Catherine was carried unconscious into the
house, and they pulled me inside too.

426
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,500
All the time I was shouting and swearing at
them.

427
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,569
"What a wicked pair of thieves!" said old
Mr Linton.

428
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:19,599
"The boy must be a gipsy, he's as dark as
the devil!"

429
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,170
Mrs Linton raised her hands in horror at the
sight of me.

430
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,779
Catherine opened her eyes, and Edgar looked
closely at her.

431
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:37,380
"Mother," he whispered, "the young lady is
Miss Earnshaw, of Wuthering Heights.

432
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,170
I've seen her in church occasionally.

433
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:47,500
And look what our dog has done to her leg!

434
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,400
It's bleeding badly!"

435
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,569
"Miss Earnshaw with a gipsy!"

436
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,019
cried Mrs Linton.

437
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,309
"Surely not!

438
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:59,059
But I think you must be right, Edgar.

439
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:05,030
This girl is wearing black, and Mr Earnshaw
died recently.

440
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,530
It must be her.

441
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,819
I'd better put a bandage on her leg at once."

442
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:16,700
"Why does her brother Hindley let her run
around with such a companion?"

443
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,779
wondered Mr Linton.

444
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:27,990
"I remember now, he's the gipsy child Mr Earnshaw
brought home from Liverpool a few years ago."

445
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,650
"He's a wicked boy, you can see that," said
Mrs Linton.

446
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,309
"And did you hear the bad language he used
just now?

447
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:41,460
I'm shocked that my children heard it."

448
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,960
I was pushed out into the garden, but I stayed
to watch through the window.

449
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,100
They put Catherine on a comfortable sofa,
cleaned her wound and fed her with cakes and

450
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,440
wine.

451
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,330
I only left the house when I was sure she
was well taken care of.

452
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,289
She's a breath of fresh air for those stupid
Lintons.

453
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:08,430
'I'm not surprised they like her.

454
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:13,050
Everybody who sees her must love her, mustn't
they, Ellen?'

455
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:19,220
'I'm afraid you'll be punished for this, Heathcliff,'
I said sadly.

456
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,740
And I was right.

457
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,089
Hindley warned Heathcliff that he must never
speak to Catherine again, or he would be sent

458
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:33,450
away from Wuthering Heights, and it was decided
that Catherine would be taught to behave like

459
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,369
a young lady.

460
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:43,160
She stayed with the Linton family at Thrushcross
Grange for five weeks, until Christmas.

461
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:52,029
By that time her leg was fine, and her manners
were much better than before.

462
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:58,580
Frances Earnshaw visited her often, bringing
her pretty dresses to wear, and persuading

463
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:04,819
her to take care of her appearance, so that
when she finally came home after her long

464
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:09,670
absence, she almost seemed a different person.

465
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:17,839
Instead of a wild, hatless girl, we saw a
beautiful, carefully dressed young lady.

466
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,160
When she had greeted all of us, she asked
for Heathcliff.

467
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,280
'Come forward, Heathcliff!'

468
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,740
called Hindley.

469
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,730
You may welcome Miss Catherine home, like
the other servants.'

470
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,200
Heathcliff was used to being outside all day,
and had not bothered to wash or change his

471
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
clothes.

472
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,750
His face and hands were black with dirt.

473
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:48,869
In spite of this, Catherine was very glad
to see him and rushed up to kiss him.

474
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,810
Then she laughed.

475
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:56,559
'How funny and black and cross you look!

476
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:02,710
But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella,
who are always so clean and tidy.

477
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,779
Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?'

478
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:14,770
But, ashamed and proud, the boy said nothing,
until suddenly his feelings were too much

479
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,770
for him.

480
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:23,550
'I won't stay to be laughed at!' he cried,
and was about to run away, when Catherine

481
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,470
caught hold of his hand.

482
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,010
'Why are you angry, Heathcliff?

483
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,010
You...

484
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,220
you just look a bit strange, that's all.

485
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,569
You're so dirty!'

486
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:41,430
She looked worriedly at her hands, and her
new dress.

487
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:46,920
'You needn't have touched me!' he said, pulling
away his hand.

488
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,630
'I like being dirty, and I'm going to be dirty!'

489
00:39:51,630 --> 00:40:00,230
As he ran miserably out of the room, Hindley
and his wife laughed loudly, delighted that

490
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,559
their plan to separate the two young people
seemed to be succeeding.

491
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,259
The next day was Christmas Day.

492
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:16,460
Edgar and Isabella Linton had been invited
to lunch, and their mother had agreed, on

493
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:23,700
condition that her darlings were kept carefully
apart from that wicked boy.

494
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:30,460
I felt sorry for poor Heathcliff, and while
the Earnshaws were at church, I helped him

495
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,509
wash and dress in clean clothes.

496
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:39,200
'You're too proud,' I scolded him as I brushed
his black hair.

497
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,059
You should think how sad Catherine is when
you can't be together.

498
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,369
And don't be jealous of Edgar Linton!'

499
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:54,740
'I wish I had blue eyes and fair hair like
him!

500
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,730
I wish I behaved well, and was going to inherit
a fortune!'

501
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:04,849
'He has none of your intelligence or character!

502
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:07,309
And if you have a good heart, you'll have
a handsome face.

503
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:16,299
Who knows who your parents were? Perhaps a
king and queen, far more important than the

504
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:17,299
Lintons!'

505
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:24,990
In this way I encouraged Heathcliff to have
more confidence in himself.

506
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:30,329
But when the Earnshaws and the Lintons arrived
back from church, the first thing Hindley

507
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:33,250
did was shout at Heathcliff.

508
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,349
'Get out of my sight, until we've finished
eating!

509
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:43,849
I'll pull that long hair of yours if you don't
obey me at once!'

510
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:46,800
'It is long,' said Edgar.

511
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,330
I'm surprised he can see anything.'

512
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,990
This was too much for Heathcliff.

513
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:59,730
He looked desperately around for a weapon,
picked up a bowl of hot soup and threw it

514
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,849
at Edgar, who started screaming.

515
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:08,910
Hindley immediately took hold of Heathcliff
and pushed him upstairs.

516
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,859
'I'm sure Hindley's going to hit him!'

517
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,130
cried Catherine.

518
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:19,529
'I hate it when Heathcliff is punished!

519
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:24,930
It's your fault, Edgar, you annoyed him!

520
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,090
Why did you speak to him?'

521
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,480
'I didn't,' replied Edgar, tears in his eyes.

522
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,270
'I promised Mother I wouldn't.

523
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,519
I spoke about him, not to him.'

524
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,859
'Well, don't cry,' said Catherine with scorn.

525
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,309
'You've made enough trouble already.

526
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:46,440
Here comes my brother.'

527
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,330
Hindley returned, hot and breathless.

528
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,609
'That'll teach him!' he said.

529
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:56,750
'And now let's have lunch!'

530
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:03,690
The others seemed to forget Heathcliff, but
I noticed Catherine could not eat much, and

531
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,430
I knew she was sorry for her friend.

532
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:14,869
In the evening there was music from a travelling
band, and dancing in the main room.

533
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:20,431
Catherine said the music sounded sweeter from
high up, and so she went to sit in the dark

534
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,250
on the stairs.

535
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:29,019
When I went to find her, however, I discovered
she had gone right to the top of the house

536
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:35,700
to talk to Heathcliff through his locked bedroom
door, and had then climbed out on to the roof

537
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,470
and in through his window.

538
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:45,829
I persuaded them both to come out of the room
the same way, as I had no key to the door,

539
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:52,579
and took Heathcliff down into the warm servants'
kitchen with me, while Catherine returned

540
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:55,319
to her guests and the dancing.

541
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,830
'You must be hungry, Heathcliff,' I said.

542
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,400
'You haven't eaten all day.

543
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,509
Have some Christmas cake, do.'

544
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:10,140
'I can't eat anything,' he growled, putting
his head in his hands.

545
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,670
'I've got to think how I can have my revenge
on Hindley.

546
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,910
I only hope he doesn't die first!

547
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:27,539
He'll be sorry he's treated me like this,
Ellen!'

548
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,440
CHAPTER FIVE
Catherine and Edgar

549
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:43,960
1778 In the summer of this year Hindley's
wife Frances had her first, and last, baby.

550
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,650
They called the boy Hareton.

551
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:52,609
But the poor woman had been ill for a long
time, although we had not realized it, and

552
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:56,890
died soon after Hareton was born.

553
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:05,029
Hindley only had room in his heart for two
people, himself and his wife, so when she

554
00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:07,980
died, he was in despair.

555
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,859
He neither cried nor prayed.

556
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:18,760
Instead he swore at God and man, and drank
himself to sleep every night.

557
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,849
The servants all left him, except for Joseph
and me.

558
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:30,259
Joseph enjoyed being able to scold his wicked
employer, with warnings from the Bible, and

559
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:33,039
I could not leave Miss Catherine.

560
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,130
After all, I had grown up with her and Hindley.

561
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:42,240
But the master's behaviour was a bad example
for Catherine and Heathcliff.

562
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,690
At fifteen, Catherine was the most beautiful
girl for miles around, but she was proud and

563
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:50,690
quick-tempered.

564
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:56,079
She led what was almost a double life.

565
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,869
At Wuthering Heights, under Heathcliffs influence,
she annoyed Hindley, laughed at Joseph, and

566
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,319
was rude to me.

567
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:11,110
But at Thrushcross Grange, which she often
visited, she showed a different, calmer side

568
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:16,210
of her character, and was polite, intelligent
and amusing.

569
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:24,089
The Lintons all liked her, and poor Edgar
had fallen in love with her.

570
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:26,130
Heathcliff was sixteen at this time.

571
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:33,560
He did not have time to study any more, and
the long hours of work on the farm made him

572
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,961
tired and dull.

573
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:41,140
There was always an angry expression on his
face, and he did not even try to keep himself

574
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,279
clean and tidy.

575
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:46,930
He seemed to want people to dislike him.

576
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:53,500
Catherine and he still spent time together,
when he was not working in the fields, but

577
00:46:53,500 --> 00:47:00,029
he no longer expressed his fondness for her
in words, and he looked angry if she touched

578
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:01,779
or kissed him.

579
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:09,470
One afternoon, when Hindley had gone into
town, Heathcliff came into the main room after

580
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,660
lunch.

581
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:17,310
I was helping Catherine to arrange her hair,
as she had invited Edgar Linton to visit her

582
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,059
while Hindley was absent.

583
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:25,900
'Catherine, are you going anywhere this afternoon?'
asked Heathcliff.

584
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,069
'Why have you got that silk dress on?

585
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:32,180
Nobody's visiting you, I hope.'

586
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:39,130
'No-o, I don't think so,' replied Catherine,
looking quickly at me.

587
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,799
'But you should be at work by now, Heathcliff.'

588
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:46,710
'That devil Hindley isn't away very often.

589
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,240
I'm taking a holiday.

590
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,450
I won't work anymore today.

591
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,670
I'm staying with you this afternoon.

592
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,130
He'll never know.'

593
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,470
Catherine thought for a moment.

594
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:04,880
'Somehow she had to prepare him for Edgar's
visit.

595
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,099
Isabella and Edgar said they might call here
this afternoon.

596
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:14,710
If they come, you'll be scolded for not working.'

597
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,990
'Tell Ellen to say you're busy and can't see
them,' he said.

598
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:22,259
Those friends of yours take up all your time.

599
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:25,499
You spend most of your evenings with them,
not with me.'

600
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:30,910
'Well, why should I always spend my time with
you?'

601
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,999
she asked crossly.

602
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,549
'What can you talk about?

603
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:37,950
How can you amuse me?'

604
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,599
'You never told me before that you didn't
like my company, Catherine!'

605
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,619
cried Heathcliff.

606
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:52,460
Just then we heard a horse outside, and there
was a light knock on the door.

607
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:58,099
Edgar Linton entered, his handsome face full
of delight at receiving Catherine's unexpected

608
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,299
invitation.

609
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:06,160
I wondered if Catherine was comparing her
two friends, as Edgar came in and Heathcliff

610
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,789
ran out.

611
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:13,430
'I haven't come too soon, have I?' asked Edgar
politely.

612
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,499
'No,' answered Catherine.

613
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:18,269
'Leave us alone, Ellen.'

614
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:26,950
'I'm just doing my work, miss,' I replied,
pretending to dust the furniture.

615
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:33,049
'Hindley had told me to be present if Edgar
Linton came to visit Catherine.'

616
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:37,750
She came up to me, and whispered crossly,
'Go away, Ellen!'

617
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:44,079
Keeping her back to Edgar, she cruelly scratched
my arm.

618
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,079
'Oh!'

619
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:48,930
I screamed, to show Edgar what had happened.

620
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,890
'What a wicked thing to do, miss!

621
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,390
You have no right to hurt me!'

622
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,240
'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!'

623
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:05,529
she cried angrily, and, unable to control
herself, hit me hard on the face.

624
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:07,470
'Catherine, love!

625
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,470
Catherine!'

626
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,359
cried Edgar, shocked.

627
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:20,249
The baby, Hareton, who followed me everywhere,
immediately started sobbing and saying, 'Wicked

628
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:22,220
aunt Catherine!'

629
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,799
She picked him up and shook the poor child
until he screamed.

630
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:31,809
Edgar rushed up to her and tried to stop her.

631
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:38,940
At once she turned and hit him over the ear
as hard as she could.

632
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,400
The young man looked very pale and went straight
to the door.

633
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,289
'Where are you going, Edgar Linton?'

634
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:49,509
she asked.

635
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:53,200
'Don't leave me!

636
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,440
I shall be miserable all night!'

637
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,700
'Can I stay after you have hit me?' he replied.

638
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,829
'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you.

639
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,670
I won't come here again!'

640
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,211
'Well, go then, if you want to!'

641
00:51:10,211 --> 00:51:11,211
she cried.

642
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:19,670
'I'm going to cry until I'm ill!' and she
dropped on to the floor, her shoulders shaking

643
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:24,089
and the tears rolling down her face.

644
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:27,670
Edgar managed to get as far as the door.

645
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:33,819
But here he hesitated, and I called out to
him to encourage him to leave.

646
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:38,309
'Miss is just a selfish child, sir!

647
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:41,839
You'd better ride home and forget her!'

648
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,980
But as he could not stop looking at her, I
knew there was no hope for him.

649
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,980
Nothing would keep him away from her now.

650
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:57,809
And sure enough, he came back into the room
and shut the door.

651
00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:03,999
This time I left them alone, and stayed in
the kitchen with little Hareton, but when

652
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:11,250
I came to warn them that Hindley had returned,
I realized that their quarrel had only brought

653
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:17,240
them closer together.

654
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,799
CHAPTER SIX
Heathcliff disappears

655
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:34,119
1778-9 Hindley came into the kitchen, swearing
terribly, just as I was about to hide little

656
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:36,599
Hareton in a cupboard.

657
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:44,599
I was always afraid that Hindley would hurt
his small son, either by accident or on purpose,

658
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,999
when he was drunk, so I tried to keep Hareton
out of the way.

659
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:53,930
But this time Hindley discovered my plan.

660
00:52:53,930 --> 00:53:04,910
'Ah, you keep my son in a cupboard, do you!'
he cried angrily, picking up a sharp kitchen

661
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:05,910
knife.

662
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:11,499
'With the devil's help I'll make you swallow
this, Ellen!'

663
00:53:11,499 --> 00:53:14,579
And he pushed the knife between my teeth.

664
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:22,730
I was never afraid he would hurt me, and calmly
took the knife out of my mouth.

665
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:34,079
'But that can't be my son, can it?' he continued
aggressively, staring at the frightened little

666
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,079
boy.

667
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:46,039
'If it is, he should be punished for not running
to greet his father.

668
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:54,509
Perhaps I'll cut his ears off!'

669
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:57,269
And then suddenly his manner changed.

670
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:59,740
'No, Hareton, darling, don't cry!

671
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,210
Kiss me, kiss your father!

672
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,210
What?

673
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,210
You won't?

674
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,289
Then I'll break your neck!'

675
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:15,710
Poor Hareton, screaming wildly, was carried
upstairs by his father.

676
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:21,999
Suddenly Hindley stopped on the stairs to
listen, almost forgetting what he was holding.

677
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:29,960
Heathcliff had come into the house and stood
at the bottom of the stairs, looking up.

678
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:36,210
Just then the child jumped out of Hindley's
arms and fell.

679
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:45,069
I only had time to gasp in horror, before
I saw that Heathcliff had caught him.

680
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:49,190
Heathcliff stared down at the child he was
holding.

681
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:55,220
He must have felt sorry he had saved the life
of his enemy's son.

682
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:03,809
I rushed to take the poor little boy in my
arms, and Hindley came slowly downstairs.

683
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:06,869
'Look what you've done, Mr Hindley!'

684
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:08,220
I cried.

685
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,490
'You nearly killed your own son!

686
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:16,299
What would his mother say if she were alive?'

687
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:19,799
'Take him away, Ellen.

688
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:23,740
And you, Heathcliff, go away too.

689
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:29,599
I won't murder you tonight, unless perhaps
I set the house on fire.

690
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,119
But that depends how I feel.'

691
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,440
And he poured himself a drink.

692
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,329
'Don't drink any more, Mr Hindley!'

693
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:43,329
I begged.

694
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:45,529
'What difference does it make?' he growled.

695
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:48,900
'Get out, both of you!

696
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,970
To the devil with you!'

697
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:56,319
We left him swearing at us, and went back
into the kitchen.

698
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:03,200
'It's a pity he can't kill himself with drink,'
muttered Heathcliff.

699
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,869
Dr Kenneth says he'll live longer than any
of us, he's so strong.'

700
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:14,150
He walked out of the door and, I thought,
into the fields.

701
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:21,950
In fact I discovered later that he was sitting
just under the window, and could hear everything

702
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:25,119
that was said in the kitchen.

703
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,630
I was singing little Hareton to sleep when
Catherine came in.

704
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,970
'Are you alone, Ellen?'

705
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:33,970
she whispered.

706
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:34,970
'Where's Heathcliff?'

707
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:38,960
'He's out on the farm,' I answered.

708
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:46,150
She looked sad and worried, and I even saw
a tear or two on her face.

709
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:52,470
But I had not forgotten how she had lied,
and behaved so badly to me as well as to Edgar

710
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:58,420
Linton, so I did not feel sorry for her, or
encourage her to talk.

711
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:04,150
'Ellen, will you keep a secret for me?'

712
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,319
she asked in the end, giving me her sweetest
smile.

713
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,970
'I must tell you!

714
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,920
I need your advice.

715
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:23,470
Today Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him,
and I gave him an answer.

716
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:31,510
Now, before I tell you if it was yes or no,
you tell me which I should have said.'

717
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,710
'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?

718
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:39,460
Perhaps you should have refused him.

719
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:45,369
He must be a fool to ask you, after you were
so rude and violent this afternoon.'

720
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,930
'Well, I accepted him, Ellen!'

721
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,900
she said crossly.

722
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,150
But should I have done so?

723
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,150
Should I?

724
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,099
What do you think?'

725
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,569
'First, do you love him?'

726
00:57:59,569 --> 00:58:00,569
I asked.

727
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:04,950
'Of course I do,' she replied.

728
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:09,029
'Why do you love him, Miss Catherine?'

729
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:12,749
'Well, I do, that's enough.

730
00:58:12,749 --> 00:58:17,970
Well, because he's handsome, and a pleasant
companion.'

731
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:23,450
'Oh, that's bad,' I said, shaking my head.

732
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:27,500
'And because he loves me.'

733
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,119
'That's worse.'

734
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:37,009
'And because he'll be rich, and I shall be
the most important woman for miles around.'

735
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:38,989
'Worst of all.

736
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:44,849
But there are several other handsome, rich
young men in the world.

737
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:47,099
Why don't you marry one of them?'

738
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,739
'I don't know any of them.

739
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:50,739
I only know Edgar.'

740
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:56,910
'Well, I don't know why you're unhappy, Miss
Catherine.

741
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:02,810
Your brother will be pleased, and Mr Edgar's
parents will, too.

742
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:03,810
You love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.

743
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:04,810
What's the problem?'

744
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:05,810
'Here!

745
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:06,810
And here!

746
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,150
replied Catherine, beating her head and her
chest.

747
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:16,900
'In my heart and soul I know I'm wrong!

748
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:24,510
Ellen, I can't live apart from Heathcliff!

749
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:30,239
He is more myself than I am.

750
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:32,400
Our souls are the same!

751
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,609
I have nothing in common with Edgar.

752
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:39,549
But I can't marry Heathcliff now!

753
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:44,089
Hindley has made him become a poor, dull farm
worker.

754
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:47,829
He'll never know how I love him.'

755
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:56,020
I suddenly heard a movement outside the window,
and saw Heathcliff stand up and walk away.

756
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:02,670
I realized he had been listening until he
heard Catherine say she could not marry him.

757
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,310
Then he stayed to hear no more.

758
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,800
'Quiet, Miss Catherine!'

759
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,460
I said.

760
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:14,749
Just imagine how hard it will be for Heathcliff
when you marry Mr Edgar!

761
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:19,430
He'll have no friends at all when you leave
him.'

762
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,779
'Leave him?

763
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:24,150
Why should we be separated?'

764
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,410
she asked angrily.

765
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,509
'Who will separate us?

766
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:30,839
Nobody will dare!

767
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:34,289
Edgar must learn to accept him as my friend.

768
01:00:34,289 --> 01:00:40,940
Didn't you ever think, Ellen, that if Heathcliff
and I married, we would be very poor?

769
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:48,739
But if I marry Edgar, I can help Heathcliff
with my husband's money.'

770
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:57,220
'That's the worst reason you've given so far
for marrying Mr Edgar,' I replied, shocked.

771
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,089
'It isn't!

772
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:04,260
Heathcliff is more important to me than myself.

773
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,759
My love for Edgar is like the leaves on the
trees.

774
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:11,839
I'm sure time will change it.

775
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:22,930
But my love for Heathcliff is like the rocks
in the ground - not beautiful, but necessary

776
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,319
and unchanging.

777
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:29,589
He's always, always in my heart-'

778
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:32,900
Just then Joseph entered the kitchen.

779
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:40,859
I whispered to Catherine that I was sure Heathcliff
had heard some of what she said.

780
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:45,299
She jumped up, frightened, and rushed outside.

781
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:51,230
But although we all looked everywhere for
Heathcliff, there was no sign of him that

782
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:56,749
night, or for many nights in the future.

783
01:01:56,749 --> 01:02:03,509
At about midnight, while we were still waiting
for him to come home, we noticed the wind

784
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:04,930
was getting stronger.

785
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:11,410
We could hear it whistling down the chimney,
and howling all around the house.

786
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:20,079
Suddenly there was a terrible crash of thunder,
and the branch of a tree fell on to the roof.

787
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:27,049
We were not hurt, but Joseph immediately dropped
on to his knees to pray.

788
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:35,200
The rain was beating down on the windows,
but Catherine stayed outside, although by

789
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,450
now her hair and clothes were completely wet.

790
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:44,289
In the end we all went to bed.

791
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:50,359
I managed to persuade Catherine to come in,
but she insisted on sleeping in the kitchen,

792
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:54,640
in case Heathcliff returned during the night.

793
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:02,170
In the morning we discovered that she had
caught a fever, as a result of getting wet.

794
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:08,880
She became seriously ill, and it was several
weeks before Dr Kenneth would allow her out

795
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,380
of bed.

796
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:19,130
When she recovered, she was invited to stay
for a while at Thrushcross Grange.

797
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:25,749
Unfortunately old Mr and Mrs Linton caught
the fever too, and died within a few days

798
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:27,130
of each other.

799
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:36,170
Catherine returned to us, prouder and quicker-tempered
than ever, but not as strong as before.

800
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:43,210
'If she gets ill again, it could be fatal,'
Dr Kenneth warned us.

801
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:51,349
'My advice to you is to do whatever she wants,
and don't make her angry!'

802
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:59,680
So we had to obey all her orders, and Joseph
and I were not allowed to scold her any more.

803
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,989
Edgar Linton was still in love with her, and
thought himself the happiest man on earth

804
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:10,619
when he married her three years after his
parents' death.

805
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:17,519
She insisted on having me with her, so we
moved together to Thrushcross Grange, although

806
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,970
I was very sad to leave little Hareton with
his father.

807
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,930
It's very late, Mr Lockwood.

808
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:28,390
I think you should go to bed, or you'll be
ill tomorrow.

809
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:34,410
I can tell you the rest of the story another
time.

810
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:42,839
Four weeks later in fact I was ill the next
day, and have been ill since then.

811
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:50,799
The terrible night I spent at Wuthering Heights
was the cause of my illness, and I blame Mr

812
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,440
Heathcliff for it.

813
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:59,299
Dr Kenneth has warned me I won't be able to
go out until the spring.

814
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:07,160
All I can do is lie in bed, listening to the
howling wind and staring at the grey northern

815
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,380
sky.

816
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:18,539
So I've decided to ask Mrs Dean to come upstairs
and finish telling me her story.

817
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:26,349
She tells me she's happy to continue.

818
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:30,760
CHAPTER SEVEN
Heathcliff returns

819
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:42,019
1783 Well, sir, when Miss Catherine became
Mrs Linton, and we went to live at Thrushcross

820
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:49,029
Grange, I must say I was surprised and pleased
by her behaviour.

821
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:54,710
She showed great fondness for her husband,
and for his sister, Isabella.

822
01:05:54,710 --> 01:06:01,049
He, of course, was very anxious that no one
should disobey her, or make her angry.

823
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:08,190
If she was depressed for a time, he blamed
it on the illness she had had, and was sympathetic.

824
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:17,680
But for most of the time, I believe they shared
a deep and growing love for each other.

825
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,849
Unfortunately this happiness did not last.

826
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:29,019
One evening I was bringing in a basket of
apples from the garden, when a voice behind

827
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:33,119
me said, 'Ellen, is that you?'

828
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,440
It was a deep, rather unusual voice.

829
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:45,249
I turned, to see a tall, dark man in the shadow
near the kitchen door.

830
01:06:45,249 --> 01:06:49,869
'Don't you know me?' he asked.

831
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:52,099
'Look, I'm not a stranger!'

832
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:53,099
'What!'

833
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:59,210
I cried in surprise, for it had been four
years since he disappeared.

834
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,210
'Heathcliff!

835
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:04,130
Is it really you?'

836
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:09,460
'Yes,' he replied, looking up at the windows
of the house.

837
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,309
'Are they at home?

838
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:13,569
Where is she?

839
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:14,829
Tell me, Ellen!

840
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,810
I must speak to her!'

841
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:22,569
'I'm not sure if you should see her,' I hesitated.

842
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:25,680
'Will the shock be too much for her?'

843
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,270
'Go and tell her I'm here, Ellen!' he said
impatiently.

844
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,480
'Don't make me suffer like this!'

845
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:40,099
I left him at the door, and went upstairs
to find Mr and Mrs Linton.

846
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:46,619
They were sitting quietly together, looking
out over the peaceful valley.

847
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:54,940
The room, and the view, and the two people,
seemed so calm that I did not want to disturb

848
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,940
them.

849
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:59,930
But I had to deliver my message.

850
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:04,349
'A man wants to see you, madam,' I muttered.

851
01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:08,960
'I'll go downstairs and see him then,' replied
Catherine.

852
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,550
'Bring the tea up, Ellen, while I'm away.'

853
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:14,940
She left the room.

854
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,819
'Who is it, Ellen?' asked Mr Edgar.

855
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:21,720
'It's that Heathcliff, sir.

856
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,259
You remember, he used to live at Wuthering
Heights.'

857
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:27,259
'What!

858
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:32,109
The gipsy, who worked on the farm?' he cried.

859
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:37,759
'Mrs Linton would be angry if she heard you
talking about him like that, sir.

860
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,060
She was very upset when he ran away.

861
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:43,199
She's very fond of him, you know.'

862
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:51,580
'Mr Edgar put his head out of the window and
called to his wife, Don't stand there in the

863
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,580
cold, love!

864
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,259
Bring the person in, if it's anyone special.'

865
01:08:54,259 --> 01:09:01,650
Catherine rushed upstairs and into the room,
wild and breathless.

866
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:04,880
She threw her arms round her husband's neck.

867
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,750
'Oh Edgar darling!

868
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,609
Heathcliffs come back!'

869
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:16,469
'Well, well,' said Mr Edgar crossly, 'there's
no need to get excited.'

870
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:25,060
'I know you didn't like him,' she said, 'but
please, I beg you to be friends with him now.

871
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,009
Shall I ask him to come up?'

872
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:33,279
'You're suggesting inviting him up here, into
our sitting room?

873
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,790
Don't you think the kitchen is more suitable
for him?'

874
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:44,190
Catherine looked at her husband, half angry
and half laughing.

875
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:48,449
'No,' she said, 'I can't sit in the kitchen.

876
01:09:48,449 --> 01:09:53,810
Ellen, bring two tables, one for your master
and Miss Isabella, the other for Heathcliff

877
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:54,810
and myself.

878
01:09:54,810 --> 01:10:01,250
We'll sit apart from them, as we're of a lower
class!

879
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,909
Will that please you, Edgar darling?

880
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,139
Decide quickly!

881
01:10:06,139 --> 01:10:10,010
I must have him near me!'

882
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:13,179
'Ellen, you go and bring him up,' said Mr
Edgar.

883
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:17,280
'And Catherine, try not to behave foolishly.

884
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,800
Remember, he's only a servant!'

885
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:28,179
When Heathcliff entered the sitting-room,
I was surprised to see how much he had changed.

886
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:34,820
He wore a confident, intelligent expression
on his face, and his manner was no longer

887
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,980
rough.

888
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:43,800
Although I recognized the same black fire
in his eyes, the farm boy had become a gentleman.

889
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:52,449
Mr Edgar was as surprised as I was, but welcomed
Heathcliff as politely as he could.

890
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:59,110
However, he grew more and more annoyed as
he watched his wife's delighted face.

891
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:02,949
She could not take her eyes off Heathcliff.

892
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:10,050
'Tomorrow I won't be able to believe that
I've seen and touched you, Heathcliff!'

893
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:13,080
she cried, catching hold of his hands.

894
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:21,969
But how cruel of you to run away and keep
silent for four years, and never think of

895
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:22,969
me!'

896
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:29,530
'I've thought of you more than you've thought
of me,' he replied quietly.

897
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:37,150
'I heard you had married, Catherine, and I
came, just to see you once, and then take

898
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:41,070
my revenge on your brother Hindley.

899
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,590
Your welcome may change my plans.

900
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:52,080
You know, I've had a bitter, hard life since
I last heard your voice, and if I've survived,

901
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,230
it's all because of you!'

902
01:11:55,230 --> 01:12:03,560
'Catherine,' said Mr Edgar, trying to remain
polite, 'please pour out the tea, or it will

903
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,560
be cold.

904
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:11,429
Mr Heathcliff will have a long walk to wherever
he's staying tonight, and I'm thirsty.'

905
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:18,000
But Catherine was too excited, and Mr Edgar
too angry, to drink any tea.

906
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,710
After a while their guest left.

907
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:27,760
We discovered that he had been invited to
stay at Wuthering Heights, by Hindley.

908
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:36,469
I could not understand why Hindley, who hated
him, would want his company, and I felt sure

909
01:12:36,469 --> 01:12:41,800
it would have been better for all of us if
Heathcliff had never come back.

910
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,989
Catherine could not keep her happiness to
herself.

911
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:51,230
In the middle of the night she woke me to
talk about Heathcliff.

912
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:55,429
'I just can't sleep, Ellen!'

913
01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:56,590
she said.

914
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:59,739
And Edgar won't listen when I tell him how
happy I am!

915
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:02,199
He's so selfish!'

916
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:08,250
'He never liked Heathcliff,' I replied, 'and
he'll be angry if you go on talking about

917
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,030
him.

918
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:17,110
You think he's weak, but he could be as determined
as you, about something he thinks is important.'

919
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,610
'No!'

920
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,790
she laughed.

921
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:25,920
'I have such confidence in Edgar's love that
I think I could kill him, and he wouldn't

922
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,200
blame me for it.

923
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,929
He will have to learn to accept Heathcliff
as my friend.'

924
01:13:30,929 --> 01:13:36,710
'Do you know why Heathcliff is staying at
Wuthering Heights?'

925
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:37,710
'Oh, yes.

926
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:41,850
He explained that he went there to look for
me.

927
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:49,030
Hindley asked him to play cards, and when
he discovered Heathcliff had a lot of money,

928
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,599
invited him to stay there.

929
01:13:50,599 --> 01:13:54,130
You know how greedy my brother is.

930
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:59,820
He'll make Heathcliff pay rent, and hope to
win money from him at cards.

931
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,980
Heathcliff wants to stay there to be near
me.

932
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,190
I'm so happy, Ellen!

933
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:11,119
And I want everyone around me to be happy
too!'

934
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:18,179
Catherine behaved so sweetly to her husband
in the next few days that Thrushcross Grange

935
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:25,230
seemed full of sunshine, and in spite of his
doubts, Mr Edgar allowed Heathcliff to visit

936
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,770
her regularly.

937
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:34,260
However, Heathcliffs visits produced a result
which none of us had expected.

938
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:41,679
Isabella, Mr Edgar's sister, a pretty girl
of eighteen, suddenly declared that she was

939
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:44,610
in love with Heathcliff.

940
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,770
Mr Edgar, who loved her dearly, was shocked.

941
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:56,730
He knew that if he and Catherine had no sons,
Isabella would inherit the considerable Linton

942
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:57,730
fortune.

943
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:04,330
He did not like the idea of the fortune passing
to Heathcliff, as Isabella's husband.

944
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:12,929
But more importantly, he suspected that Heathcliff
was hiding his true wickedness under his gentlemanly

945
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:14,880
appearance.

946
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:23,300
Catherine tried hard to persuade Isabella
that Heathcliff was not worth loving, but

947
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:30,300
poor Isabella was jealous of Catherine's relationship
with Heathcliff and would not listen.

948
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:36,869
Finally, Catherine told Heathcliff himself
that Isabella was in love with him.

949
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:39,909
She thought she knew what his answer would
be.

950
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:44,860
'How could I ever love that stupid girl?'
he asked.

951
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:51,659
'She has a miserable pale face, and weak blue
eyes, just like your husband!

952
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:57,639
But... she will inherit the family wealth
from him, won't she?'

953
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:00,610
'That's true,' replied Catherine.

954
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:03,030
'But don't think about that, Heathcliff.

955
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:09,980
I hope Edgar and I will have several sons,
and then they will inherit it.'

956
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:17,699
Catherine did not speak of this matter again,
but I am sure Heathcliff often thought about

957
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,030
it.

958
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,239
I watched him carefully in the next few days.

959
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:28,570
I hoped he would do nothing to hurt Mr Edgar,
who was a kind master to me.

960
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:33,239
I was worried, too, about what was happening
at Wuthering Heights.

961
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:40,710
Hindley and his son Hareton seemed like lost
sheep to me, and I knew there was a wicked

962
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:48,590
wolf just waiting for the chance to attack
them.

963
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:55,280
CHAPTER EIGHT
Catherine is ill

964
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:04,070
1783 The next time Heathcliff came to Thrushcross
Grange, he met Isabella by chance in front

965
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,290
of the house.

966
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:12,110
I was watching from the kitchen window, as
he went up to her, and, supposing that no

967
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:15,900
one else could see him, kissed her.

968
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,810
'Look, madam!'

969
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:21,240
I cried to Catherine, who was passing through
the kitchen.

970
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,679
That devil Heathcliff told you he could never
love Miss Isabella!

971
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,510
And now he's kissing her!'

972
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:35,300
So when Heathcliff entered the house, Catherine
was ready to scold him.

973
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:39,199
'Leave Isabella alone, Heathcliff!'

974
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,150
she ordered.

975
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:43,000
'You'll make Edgar angry!'

976
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,590
'You think I'm afraid of that weak little
creature?' he growled.

977
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:52,380
'Anyway, what difference does it make to you?

978
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,400
I can kiss her if she likes it.

979
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:00,850
I'm not your husband, you needn't be jealous
of me!'

980
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,531
'I'm not jealous of you!'

981
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:03,531
replied Catherine.

982
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:09,380
'If you like Isabella, you can marry her.

983
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,710
But do you like her?'

984
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:15,670
'It's you I want to talk about, Catherine.

985
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,880
You know you've treated me badly.

986
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,929
And I'm going to have my revenge!

987
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:25,630
Thank you for telling me Isabella's secret.

988
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:28,630
I swear I'll make good use of it!'

989
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:36,820
At this point I went to look for my master,
and told him that Catherine and Heathcliff

990
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,300
were quarrelling in the kitchen.

991
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:45,469
'How can my wife call that man a friend?'
he cried angrily.

992
01:18:45,469 --> 01:18:48,869
I've been too weak with her.

993
01:18:48,869 --> 01:18:53,170
'I can't allow him to visit her anymore.'

994
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:56,070
'Call two servants, Ellen.'

995
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:58,320
He went to the kitchen.

996
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,160
I followed him, telling the servants to wait
in the hall.

997
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,780
'Catherine!' said Mr Edgar to his wife as
he entered.

998
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:12,250
'Do you think it's right to listen to this
wicked man's talk?'

999
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:18,570
'Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?'
asked Catherine coldly.

1000
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:23,920
Heathcliff laughed, which made Mr Edgar even
angrier.

1001
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,880
'You, sir,' he said to Heathcliff, are poisoning
our family life.

1002
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:35,770
I should never have accepted you as Catherine's
friend.

1003
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:42,159
I must inform you that you will never be allowed
to enter this house again, and that if you

1004
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:47,780
don't leave within three minutes, you will
be thrown out.'

1005
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,610
'Well, well!'

1006
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:56,179
replied Heathcliff, looking scornfully at
Mr Edgar's small figure.

1007
01:19:56,179 --> 01:20:01,929
'So, you're going to throw me out yourself,
are you?'

1008
01:20:01,929 --> 01:20:05,610
My master looked towards the door.

1009
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:11,780
I realized he wanted to call the servants,
as he knew he was not strong enough to fight

1010
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,870
Heathcliff alone.

1011
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:17,190
But Catherine must have guessed his plan.

1012
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:20,690
She hurried to the door and locked it.

1013
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:25,980
Mr Edgar looked at her in angry surprise.

1014
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:31,710
'You must fight him like a gentleman, without
anyone to help you!'

1015
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,040
she told her husband.

1016
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,280
'That'll teach you to scold me!'

1017
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:43,119
Mr Edgar tried to get hold of the key, but
she threw it quickly into the hottest part

1018
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:44,989
of the fire.

1019
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:50,620
He went very pale, and could not stop his
whole body trembling.

1020
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:54,060
'Oh Edgar!'

1021
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,389
cried his wife.

1022
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:58,510
'You've lost the fight already!

1023
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:02,890
You aren't a man, you're a mouse!'

1024
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:09,940
'So that,' said Heathcliff, pointing at Mr
Edgar, 'is the thing you preferred to me,

1025
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,940
Catherine.

1026
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:16,780
Is he crying, or is he going to die of fear?'

1027
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:22,949
He went up to look more closely at Mr Edgar,
who suddenly recovered and hit Heathcliff

1028
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:24,909
hard on the neck.

1029
01:21:24,909 --> 01:21:32,710
While Heathcliff was getting his breath back,
Mr Edgar walked out of the other kitchen door

1030
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:34,280
into the garden.

1031
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:41,040
'Now you'll never be able to come here again,'
said Catherine to Heathcliff.

1032
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,650
'Go away quickly!

1033
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:45,050
He'll return with men and guns.'

1034
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:50,710
Heathcliff was sensible enough to take her
advice.

1035
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:57,290
He broke down the locked door and escaped,
just as the master and his men returned.

1036
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:03,380
Catherine, who was over-excited, ordered me
to go upstairs with her.

1037
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:09,840
I hoped she would not discover that I had
told Mr Edgar about her quarrel with Heathcliff.

1038
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,159
'I'm wild with anger, Ellen!'

1039
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,380
she said, when we reached the sitting-room.

1040
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:19,889
'All this trouble is because of Isabella!

1041
01:22:19,889 --> 01:22:24,409
Tell Edgar I'm in danger of becoming seriously
ill.

1042
01:22:24,409 --> 01:22:28,619
I hope it's true, I want to frighten him.

1043
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:31,340
He's upset me badly.

1044
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:34,920
Why did he listen to us talking in the kitchen?

1045
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:40,530
Heathcliff says wicked things, but I know
I can control him.

1046
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:47,170
Well, if I can't have Heathcliff as my friend,
if Edgar is going to be mean and jealous,

1047
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,500
I'll try to break both their hearts by breaking
my own.

1048
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:58,230
You must remind Edgar how quick tempered I
am, and what Dr Kenneth said about my health.

1049
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:02,510
Edgar must let me do what I want!'

1050
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:10,050
I did not feel sympathetic towards Catherine,
and certainly did not want to frighten my

1051
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,370
poor master by telling him she was ill.

1052
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:18,530
As I was leaving the room, however, he entered.

1053
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:24,199
'Catherine,' he said, 'you must tell me one
thing.

1054
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:27,710
You must choose between me and Heathcliff.

1055
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:30,320
Which do you intend to have?'

1056
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,170
'Leave me alone!'

1057
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:34,500
she cried wildly.

1058
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:41,170
'I'm ill, can't you see, I can't even stand!

1059
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,400
Edgar, leave me!'

1060
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:48,480
She fell, stiff and pale, on to the floor.

1061
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,410
Mr Edgar looked very frightened.

1062
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:55,640
'Don't worry, sir,' I whispered to him.

1063
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:02,440
'She told me she would try to make you afraid
by pretending to be ill.'

1064
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:06,260
Unfortunately she heard me.

1065
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:12,610
She jumped up, her hair loose and her eyes
staring, and rushed to her bedroom.

1066
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:17,090
We heard the key turn in the lock.

1067
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:22,429
For the next few days she refused to speak
to anyone, even me.

1068
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:28,260
I took her food up to her room, but she would
not eat.

1069
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:34,489
Mr Edgar spent his time in the library, and
did not ask about his wife.

1070
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:39,710
He hoped, I suppose, that she would come and
ask him to forgive her.

1071
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:44,650
But I knew she was too proud to do that.

1072
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,469
On the third day she unlocked her door and
called me.

1073
01:24:49,469 --> 01:24:54,040
She ate and drank eagerly, then lay down again.

1074
01:24:54,040 --> 01:25:00,909
'Oh, why don't I die, since no one cares about
me!'

1075
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:02,040
she muttered.

1076
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,989
'Edgar doesn't love me at all!

1077
01:25:04,989 --> 01:25:10,510
What is he doing all this time, Ellen?'

1078
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:12,920
'He's reading books in the library, madam,'
I answered.

1079
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,760
'Reading books!'

1080
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,520
she cried, shocked.

1081
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,119
'And I'm dying up here!

1082
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:23,960
My God!

1083
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,320
Does he know how I've changed, how ill I am?

1084
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:33,770
Can't you tell him I'm seriously ill, Ellen?'

1085
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:38,750
'You forget, Mrs Linton, that you've eaten
tonight.

1086
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:41,670
I'm sure you'll feel better tomorrow morning.'

1087
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:49,170
I still wanted to make her realize how selfish
she was being, although I was a little worried

1088
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:52,820
by her pale, almost ghostly face.

1089
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:57,770
'I begin to see that you don't like me, Ellen.

1090
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:58,790
How strange!

1091
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:01,829
I always thought everybody loved me!

1092
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:09,340
Now they are all my enemies - Isabella and
Edgar and you!

1093
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:13,650
I'll die with cold faces around me!

1094
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:17,750
I've had terrible dreams these past few nights,
you know.

1095
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,599
Open the window, Ellen!

1096
01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:20,929
I'm so hot!'

1097
01:26:20,929 --> 01:26:26,619
I refused, as it was the middle of winter.

1098
01:26:26,619 --> 01:26:28,449
She was feverish.

1099
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:31,969
'Who is that over there?'

1100
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:38,020
she asked, staring at her own face in a mirror
opposite her bed.

1101
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:44,960
I could not make her understand it was herself,
and I began to be afraid that her illness

1102
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,350
was real.

1103
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:51,860
'Stay with me, Ellen,' she cried, holding
my hand.

1104
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,140
'I'm frightened of that face!

1105
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:58,410
I'm frightened of being alone!

1106
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:04,210
I wish I were in my bed at Wuthering Heights,
with the wind howling through the trees.

1107
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:11,140
Do let me feel a breath of air from the moors,
just one breath!'

1108
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:16,139
I opened the window for a moment, then closed
it.

1109
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:19,760
The cold air seemed to calm her.

1110
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:27,469
'I wish I were a young girl again, wild and
free, out on the moors with Heathcliff!

1111
01:27:27,469 --> 01:27:32,420
Open the window again, wider this time!

1112
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,659
Why won't you?'

1113
01:27:34,659 --> 01:27:39,389
'Because I don't want you to die of cold,'
I replied.

1114
01:27:39,389 --> 01:27:43,639
'But it's my only chance of life!'

1115
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:47,750
she cried, jumping out of bed and going to
the window.

1116
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:54,790
I tried to force her back to bed, but her
fever made her surprisingly strong.

1117
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:59,410
We looked out together into the icy darkness.

1118
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:03,230
There was no moon, and no lights were visible
anywhere.

1119
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:09,040
But Catherine was sure she could see Wuthering
Heights.

1120
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,540
'Look!'

1121
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,540
she said.

1122
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:18,380
'There's my old home, and the churchyard near
it.

1123
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:21,020
I won't lie there alone, Heathcliff!

1124
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:28,360
I won't rest until you're in the grave with
me!'

1125
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:34,909
I was still holding her back from the window,
and wondering what to do next, when Mr Edgar

1126
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:35,909
entered.

1127
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:42,530
'Please help, sir,' I called, 'Mrs Linton
is ill.'

1128
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,239
'Catherine's ill?' he gasped.

1129
01:28:45,239 --> 01:28:48,909
'Shut the window, Ellen!

1130
01:28:48,909 --> 01:28:49,909
Catherine!

1131
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:50,909
Why-'

1132
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:58,599
When he saw his wife's face, he was so shocked
that he stopped speaking and stared at her

1133
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:00,410
in horror.

1134
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:06,810
She was almost unconscious and did not recognize
him at first.

1135
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:13,659
'Ah, it's you, is it, Edgar Linton?'

1136
01:29:13,659 --> 01:29:16,730
she said after a few moments.

1137
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:25,570
'You don't come when you're wanted, and now
you come when you're not wanted!

1138
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:34,579
But whatever you say, nothing can keep me
from my home, my place of rest, out there

1139
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:38,940
in the open air, with a gravestone at my head!'

1140
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:45,710
'She's feverish, sir, and doesn't know what
she's saying,' I whispered.

1141
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:50,400
'If she has food and rest, she'll recover.'

1142
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:57,320
'I want no further advice from you, Ellen
Dean,' said Mr Edgar coldly.

1143
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,030
You knew how ill she was, and you didn't tell
me!'

1144
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:06,870
I ran downstairs and out of the kitchen door
to fetch the doctor.

1145
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:12,989
I thought I heard the sound of horses in the
distance, which seemed strange at two o'clock

1146
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:14,469
in the morning.

1147
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:22,219
And when I found Dr Kenneth, he told me someone
had seen Isabella and Heathcliff meeting secretly

1148
01:30:22,219 --> 01:30:25,440
in the garden earlier that evening.

1149
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,320
That night none of us slept.

1150
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:33,500
We all sat together and waited, while the
doctor stayed with his patient.

1151
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:40,330
He told us he hoped that Catherine would recover,
if we kept her very quiet.

1152
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:46,909
In the morning we discovered that Isabella's
room was empty.

1153
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:50,219
She had run away with Heathcliff!

1154
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:57,360
When Mr Edgar heard the news, he just said,
'She chose to go with him.

1155
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:01,490
Don't speak to me of her again.

1156
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:09,449
I no longer think of her as my sister.'

1157
01:31:09,449 --> 01:31:13,000
CHAPTER NINE
Isabella's story

1158
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:22,960
1784 For two months we heard nothing of Isabella
or Heathcliff.

1159
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:31,030
During that time Catherine was dangerously
ill with brain fever, and Dr Kenneth warned

1160
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:36,010
us that even if she recovered, her brain would
never return to normal.

1161
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:43,700
However she did seem to get better, and no
one could have been happier than my master,

1162
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:48,980
when he saw her sitting up in bed for the
first time, and beginning to take an interest

1163
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,460
in the people and things around her.

1164
01:31:51,460 --> 01:32:00,670
He loved her so much, and took such good care
of her, that I really thought she would recover.

1165
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:03,540
There was another reason for her to live.

1166
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:09,949
She was expecting a baby, and we all hoped
she would have a son, who would inherit the

1167
01:32:09,949 --> 01:32:12,060
Linton fortune.

1168
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:22,130
Then Mr Edgar received a letter from Isabella,
telling him that she and Heathcliff were married.

1169
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:27,540
With it was a long letter for me, which said:

1170
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,540
Wuthering Heights

1171
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,280
Dear Ellen,

1172
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:37,420
I arrived here last night and heard that Catherine
is ill.

1173
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:42,940
My brother refuses to write to me, so you
are the only one I can write to.

1174
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:50,469
Tell Edgar I still love him and Catherine,
and want to return to Thrushcross Grange,

1175
01:32:50,469 --> 01:32:53,679
but I can't!

1176
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,440
The rest of this letter is for you alone,
Ellen.

1177
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:03,630
Two questions - how did you manage to get
on with the people in this house?

1178
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:05,770
They don't seem human!

1179
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:12,489
And (this interests me very much) what is
Mr Heathcliff?

1180
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:14,060
A man?

1181
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,639
A madman?

1182
01:33:15,639 --> 01:33:17,219
A devil?

1183
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:23,510
When you come to visit me, you must explain
to me what sort of creature I've married.

1184
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:28,960
And you must come very soon, with a message
from Edgar.

1185
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,849
Heathcliff brought me here last night.

1186
01:33:30,849 --> 01:33:34,930
This house is going to be my home, he says.

1187
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:40,460
He disappeared as soon as we arrived, so I
entered the kitchen alone.

1188
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:45,850
What a miserable, depressing place it is now,
Ellen!

1189
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:50,040
By the fire stood a dirty child.

1190
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:56,300
I realized he must be Catherine's nephew,
Hareton, and tried to shake his hand.

1191
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:04,380
But he greeted me by swearing at me, so I
went into the hall to find somebody else.

1192
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:11,150
When I knocked at another door, it was opened
by a tall, thin man, with long, dirty hair

1193
01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:13,880
hanging down to his shoulders.

1194
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:19,880
I knew this must be Hindley Earnshaw, Catherine's
brother and Hareton's father.

1195
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:24,890
His eyes, and Hareton's, reminded me of Catherine.

1196
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:29,690
'What do you want?' he asked roughly.

1197
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:33,489
'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied.

1198
01:34:33,489 --> 01:34:36,849
'Now I'm married to Mr Heathcliff.'

1199
01:34:36,849 --> 01:34:40,690
'Ah, so that devil has returned!

1200
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:42,540
Good!' he growled.

1201
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:48,580
You can imagine, Ellen, how unhappy I felt
in that unpleasant house.

1202
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:56,680
I knew that only four miles away was my real
home, Thrushcross Grange, containing the only

1203
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,059
people I loved in the world.

1204
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:06,030
But those four miles were like an ocean, which
I could not cross!

1205
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:12,310
Don't tell Edgar or Catherine this, but I
had hoped to find a friend at Wuthering Heights,

1206
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:15,560
someone to support me against Heathcliff.

1207
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:19,450
Now I realized that no one here would help
me.

1208
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:27,219
After a long silence I said, 'Please ask a
maid to show me my bedroom.

1209
01:35:27,219 --> 01:35:29,320
I'm tired after my journey.'

1210
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,290
'We have no maids here,' he answered.

1211
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:37,040
'Joseph will show you Heathcliffs room, if
you like.

1212
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:43,020
And - and - you'd better lock the bedroom
door tonight!'

1213
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:44,880
Why, Mr Earnshaw?'

1214
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,119
I asked.

1215
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:51,239
I did not want to lock myself in with Heathcliff.

1216
01:35:51,239 --> 01:35:55,159
He brought out a gun, which had a knife attached
to it.

1217
01:35:55,159 --> 01:35:58,829
'Look at this,' he said.

1218
01:35:58,829 --> 01:36:03,770
Every night I try to open his bedroom door.

1219
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:05,830
Up to now he's locked it.

1220
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:09,110
But one night he'll forget, and then I'll
kill him!'

1221
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,110
'Why do you hate him so much?'

1222
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:11,110
I asked.

1223
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:12,860
'Because he's taken everything from me!' he
shouted angrily.

1224
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:21,739
'There's nothing left for Hareton to inherit!

1225
01:36:21,739 --> 01:36:31,800
But I'm going to get it all back and his money
too, and then his blood.

1226
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,690
Then the devil can have his soul!'

1227
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:37,280
He seemed mad to me, Ellen.

1228
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,290
I left him, and went to find the old servant,
Joseph.

1229
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:47,460
It seemed that Heathcliffs room was locked,
and there were no guest bedrooms, so in the

1230
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:50,740
end I slept on a chair in the child's room.

1231
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:54,659
What a welcome to my new home!

1232
01:36:54,659 --> 01:36:58,989
I know Heathcliff blames Edgar for Catherine's
illness.

1233
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:02,349
He has warned me he'll make me suffer for
it.

1234
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:09,510
Oh, I do hate him - I'm so miserable - I've
been such a fool!

1235
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:13,270
Don't tell anyone at Thrushcross Grange about
this, Ellen.

1236
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:19,159
Come quickly - don't disappoint me!

1237
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:20,979
Isabella

1238
01:37:20,979 --> 01:37:28,020
As soon as I had read this, I asked Mr Edgar
if I could take a message from him to his

1239
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:29,120
sister.

1240
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,480
'You may visit her this afternoon, Ellen,
if you like.

1241
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,619
Tell her I'm not angry, just sorry to have
lost her.

1242
01:37:35,619 --> 01:37:40,730
I can't imagine she will ever be happy.

1243
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:45,719
I shall never visit her or write to her.'

1244
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:51,880
When I arrived at Wuthering Heights that afternoon,
I was shocked to see how much worse the house

1245
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,970
looked than when I used to live there.

1246
01:37:54,970 --> 01:38:01,679
I realized that Hindley did not care what
conditions he lived in, and Joseph clearly

1247
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,590
spent more time praying than cleaning.

1248
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:10,220
Heathcliff and Isabella were both in the main
room.

1249
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:15,540
Heathcliff looked more like a gentleman than
I had ever seen him, but his wife had not

1250
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:19,010
bothered to brush her hair or change her dress.

1251
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:26,219
I had to explain to poor Isabella that Mr
Edgar had refused to write to her.

1252
01:38:26,219 --> 01:38:29,739
She cried a little when she heard that.

1253
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:34,640
Then Heathcliff asked me question after question
about Catherine's illness.

1254
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:42,920
'If you really love her,' I told him, 'you'll
keep away from her now.

1255
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,180
She mustn't be over-excited.

1256
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:47,739
Her health will always be weak.

1257
01:38:47,739 --> 01:38:52,710
And her loving husband is a very good nurse
to her!'

1258
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:56,360
'Her loving husband!'

1259
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,570
repeated Heathcliff scornfully.

1260
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:03,460
'Don't compare my feeling for her with his!

1261
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:10,150
No, Ellen, before you leave this house, I'll
make you promise to arrange a meeting for

1262
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:11,820
me with Catherine.

1263
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,639
I must see her!'

1264
01:39:13,639 --> 01:39:16,909
'I'll never agree to that,' I said.

1265
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,739
'She's just beginning to recover.

1266
01:39:20,739 --> 01:39:27,809
She's almost forgotten you, and now you want
to upset her again!'

1267
01:39:27,809 --> 01:39:33,659
'Ellen, you know as well as I do that she
can never forget me!

1268
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:38,969
If she thinks once of Edgar Linton, she thinks
a thousand times of me!

1269
01:39:38,969 --> 01:39:40,989
He can't love her as I can!

1270
01:39:40,989 --> 01:39:47,160
And Catherine has a heart as deep as mine!'

1271
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:52,829
'Catherine and Edgar are very fond of each
other!' said Isabella suddenly.

1272
01:39:52,829 --> 01:39:57,010
'Don't speak of my brother like that!'

1273
01:39:57,010 --> 01:40:04,660
'Your dear brother doesn't care enough about
you to write to you,' replied Heathcliff,

1274
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,960
smiling sourly.

1275
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:14,159
'That's because he doesn't know how much I've
suffered,' she answered quietly, turning away

1276
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,880
to hide the tears on her face.

1277
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:26,199
'Sir,' I said, 'it seems to me that Miss Isabella,
Mrs Heathcliff, I should say, is unhappy.

1278
01:40:26,199 --> 01:40:29,199
You must treat her kindly.

1279
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:32,050
Try to look after her.

1280
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:34,830
Let her have a maid, for example.'

1281
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:39,170
'I'm not going to be soft with her,' he replied
with a laugh.

1282
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:42,210
'She was stupid enough to run away with me.

1283
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,469
I never pretended to love her.

1284
01:40:44,469 --> 01:40:48,040
Now I think she's beginning to realize that
I scorn her.

1285
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:54,139
She's an even weaker fool than her brother,
but she's going to be useful to me.

1286
01:40:54,139 --> 01:40:57,989
That's why I'm keeping her with me.'

1287
01:40:57,989 --> 01:41:03,750
'Ellen, he says he married me to have his
revenge on Edgar!

1288
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:08,440
But I won't let him carry out his plan, whatever
it is.

1289
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:11,970
I'll die, or I'll see him dead first!'

1290
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:17,780
'You're getting violent, Isabella!' said Heathcliff.

1291
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:18,969
Go upstairs now.

1292
01:41:18,969 --> 01:41:22,369
I want to speak to Ellen Dean in private.

1293
01:41:22,369 --> 01:41:23,710
Go on!'

1294
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:28,270
And he pushed her roughly out of the door.

1295
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:31,639
'Don't you feel pity for her?'

1296
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:33,449
I asked, when we were alone.

1297
01:41:33,449 --> 01:41:38,330
'Have you ever felt pity for anybody in your
life?'

1298
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,550
'Why should I?

1299
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:44,400
She's just like an insect under my foot.

1300
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,120
The more she cries, the more I enjoy hurting
her.

1301
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,270
Now, Ellen, listen.

1302
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:57,429
I'll wait every day and every evening in the
Grange garden, until I find a chance to see

1303
01:41:57,429 --> 01:41:58,429
Catherine.

1304
01:41:58,429 --> 01:42:03,690
If I meet Edgar Linton or his servants, I'll
shoot them.

1305
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:08,159
But don't you think it'd be better to avoid
a fight?

1306
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,800
You could tell me when she'll be alone.

1307
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,929
Then there'll be no violence.'

1308
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:23,679
I argued and complained, and refused fifty
times, but in the end he forced me to agree.

1309
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:29,020
I promised to let him know when Edgar Linton
was away from home.

1310
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:35,929
I suppose it was wrong of me, but I hoped
it would be Heathcliffs last meeting with

1311
01:42:35,929 --> 01:42:41,050
Catherine.

1312
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:45,920
CHAPTER TEN
Heathcliff visits Catherine for the last time

1313
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:57,409
1784 Heathcliff had given me a letter for
Catherine, but I decided not to show it to

1314
01:42:57,409 --> 01:43:01,239
her until Mr Edgar was out of the house.

1315
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:05,929
My chance came four days after my visit to
Wuthering Heights.

1316
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:14,030
As it was a Sunday, Mr Edgar and all the servants
went to church, leaving me alone to look after

1317
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:15,650
Catherine.

1318
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:21,099
She was sitting downstairs, by an open window,
enjoying the spring sunshine.

1319
01:43:21,099 --> 01:43:29,150
Her appearance had changed since her illness,
but there was a strange beauty in her pale

1320
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,150
face.

1321
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:38,070
She did not read or sew any more, but used
to sit there silently, staring into the distance.

1322
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:45,130
Her eyes seemed fixed on something far away,
something beyond normal sight.

1323
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:53,079
I showed her the letter, but she looked confused
and could not seem to understand it, so I

1324
01:43:53,079 --> 01:43:54,960
had to explain.

1325
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,190
'It's from Mr Heathcliff,' I said gently.

1326
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:03,869
'He's in the garden, and wants to see you.

1327
01:44:03,869 --> 01:44:07,719
What shall I tell him?'

1328
01:44:07,719 --> 01:44:12,580
She said nothing, but bent forward in her
chair to listen.

1329
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:17,730
We both heard someone coming through the hall.

1330
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:23,750
Heathcliff had realized the house was almost
empty, and had found an open door.

1331
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:28,270
Catherine looked eagerly towards the entrance
to the room.

1332
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:34,340
He appeared, and in two steps was by her side.

1333
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:41,070
For five whole minutes he held her in his
arms and kissed her again and again.

1334
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:46,180
It gave him great pain to look at her face.

1335
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:54,639
He could see, as I could, that she would never
recover, that she was certain to die.

1336
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,679
'Oh, Catherine!

1337
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:00,710
Oh, my life!

1338
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:05,420
How can I bear it!' he cried.

1339
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:12,420
'You and Edgar have broken my heart,' said
Catherine.

1340
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:17,750
'And you both want me to pity you!

1341
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:21,220
How strong you are, Heathcliff!

1342
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:25,940
You'll live for years after my death!

1343
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:33,739
Will you forget me, and be happy with others,
when I'm in my grave?'

1344
01:45:33,739 --> 01:45:37,389
'It's wicked of you to say that, Catherine.

1345
01:45:37,389 --> 01:45:43,139
You know your words will burn forever in my
memory after you've left me.

1346
01:45:43,139 --> 01:45:46,530
You know I could never forget you!'

1347
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:51,480
'I don't want you to suffer more than I do,
Heathcliff.

1348
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:57,020
I only want us to be together, always.'

1349
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:02,989
Heathcliff turned away, his shoulders shaking.

1350
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:09,969
'That isn't my Heathcliff,' Catherine said
to me.

1351
01:46:09,969 --> 01:46:16,409
'I'll always love my Heathcliff, and take
him with me.

1352
01:46:16,409 --> 01:46:19,530
He's in my soul, you see.

1353
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:24,849
Oh, Ellen, I do want to escape from this prison.

1354
01:46:24,849 --> 01:46:30,560
There's a beautiful world waiting for me out
there.

1355
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,329
You feel sorry for me now because I'm ill.

1356
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:44,260
Well, very soon I'll feel sorry for you, because
I'll be beyond you all!'

1357
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:50,580
Heathcliff turned towards her, his fierce
eyes wet.

1358
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:56,190
For a moment they looked at each other, and
then they were in each other's arms again.

1359
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:59,949
No one could have separated them.

1360
01:46:59,949 --> 01:47:06,219
'How cruel you've been to me, Catherine!'
he cried wildly.

1361
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:12,739
'You loved me, so why did you marry Edgar
Linton?

1362
01:47:12,739 --> 01:47:14,270
It's all your fault!

1363
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:18,679
I haven't broken your heart, you've broken
it!

1364
01:47:18,679 --> 01:47:21,210
And you've broken mine too!

1365
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:26,880
Do you think I want to live after you are
dead?'

1366
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:33,910
'If I've done wrong, I'm dying for it!'

1367
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:35,679
sobbed Catherine.

1368
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:38,619
It's your fault too, Heathcliff!

1369
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:41,760
You left me, remember?

1370
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,870
But I forgive you.

1371
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:48,350
Now forgive me!'

1372
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:56,989
'It's hard to forgive, when I look at your
sad eyes, and feel your thin hands.

1373
01:47:56,989 --> 01:47:58,969
Kiss me again, Catherine!

1374
01:47:58,969 --> 01:48:05,550
I forgive you for making me suffer, but how
can I forgive you for dying?'

1375
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:15,310
Catherine sobbed quietly, hiding her face
in his shoulder, and tears rolled down Heathcliffs

1376
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:16,559
dark face.

1377
01:48:16,559 --> 01:48:24,000
Suddenly I noticed, through the window, the
servants coming back from church.

1378
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,570
I was afraid Mr Edgar would find Heathcliff
with Catherine.

1379
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:33,190
'My master will be here in a moment,' I warned
them.

1380
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:34,920
'I must go, Catherine,' said Heathcliff.

1381
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:35,920
'No, no!'

1382
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:36,920
she screamed.

1383
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:37,920
'Don't go!

1384
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:38,920
It's the last time!

1385
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,889
Edgar won't hurt us!

1386
01:48:41,889 --> 01:48:46,929
Heathcliff, I'll die if you go!'

1387
01:48:46,929 --> 01:48:51,960
'All right, my darling, I'll stay.

1388
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:57,770
If he shot me in your arms, I'd die happy.'

1389
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:04,630
At that moment my master appeared at the door.

1390
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:10,179
When he saw Heathcliff holding his wife, he
went pale with anger.

1391
01:49:10,179 --> 01:49:19,099
'Here, take care of her first,' said Heathcliff,
putting Catherine in her husband's arms, 'then

1392
01:49:19,099 --> 01:49:22,079
speak to me later if you wish.'

1393
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:24,429
He walked out of the house.

1394
01:49:24,429 --> 01:49:32,059
Catherine seemed to be unconscious, and Mr
Edgar was so worried about her that he forgot

1395
01:49:32,059 --> 01:49:34,199
about Heathcliff for the moment.

1396
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:41,949
She recovered a little, but did not recognize
any of us, and was clearly very ill.

1397
01:49:41,949 --> 01:49:49,530
We put her to bed immediately, and at twelve
o'clock that night her daughter, Cathy, was

1398
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:53,370
born, two months early.

1399
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:57,849
That's the young lady you saw at Wuthering
Heights, Mr Lockwood.

1400
01:49:57,849 --> 01:50:06,659
Two hours later, Catherine died, without calling
for Heathcliff, or recognizing Edgar.

1401
01:50:06,659 --> 01:50:11,140
My poor master was in the depths of despair.

1402
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:18,789
I thought it was very unfortunate that Catherine
had only given him a daughter, not a son.

1403
01:50:18,789 --> 01:50:27,760
Now the Linton fortune would pass to Isabella
and her husband after Mr Edgar's death.

1404
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,880
'Catherine's dead body lay peacefully on her
bed.

1405
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:36,539
In death she looked more beautiful than in
life.

1406
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:44,139
I wondered if she was now beyond us all',
as she had said, and hoped that her soul had

1407
01:50:44,139 --> 01:50:46,929
found a home with God.

1408
01:50:46,929 --> 01:50:51,480
In the morning I went to look for Heathcliff.

1409
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:58,570
I found him in the Grange garden, where he
had been waiting for news all night.

1410
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:04,050
'She's dead, I know!' he called to me as I
came closer.

1411
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:09,480
'Don't cry, she doesn't need your tears!

1412
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:16,579
Tell me - tell me, how did-?'

1413
01:51:16,579 --> 01:51:21,520
He tried to say her name, but could not manage
it.

1414
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:29,739
How did she die?' he said at last, staring
fiercely at me.

1415
01:51:29,739 --> 01:51:34,770
Don't be sorry for me, I don't want your pity!'

1416
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:36,380
'Poor creature!'

1417
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:37,989
I thought.

1418
01:51:37,989 --> 01:51:46,120
You have a heart just like other men, but
you are too proud to show it!'

1419
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:52,280
Aloud I said, 'She died quietly, in her sleep.

1420
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:55,619
Her life finished in a gentle dream.

1421
01:51:55,619 --> 01:51:58,632
I hope she wakes as calmly in the other world!'

1422
01:51:58,632 --> 01:52:00,449
'Where are you, Catherine?' he cried in despair.

1423
01:52:00,449 --> 01:52:12,510
'Don't leave me here, where I can't find you!

1424
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:16,329
I pray that you will never rest while I'm
alive.

1425
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:24,070
You said I killed you - haunt me then!

1426
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:33,369
Murdered people do haunt their murderers,
I believe.

1427
01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:34,369
Come back as a ghost - drive me mad - I don't
care!

1428
01:52:34,369 --> 01:52:35,369
Oh, God!

1429
01:52:35,369 --> 01:52:36,730
I can't bear it!

1430
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:39,849
I cannot live without you, my soul!'

1431
01:52:39,849 --> 01:52:48,320
He howled like a wild animal, and hit his
forehead several times against a tree, until

1432
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,739
the wood was covered in blood.

1433
01:52:50,739 --> 01:52:56,539
I knew I could no longer help him, so I left
him.

1434
01:52:56,539 --> 01:53:00,940
Catherine was buried the following Friday.

1435
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:09,070
Her brother Hindley, although invited, did
not come, and Isabella was not invited, so

1436
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:14,920
it was only Mr Edgar and the servants who
attended the ceremony.

1437
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:22,280
To our surprise, she was not buried in the
church with the Lintons, nor with the Earnshaws.

1438
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:29,880
She lies in an open corner of the churchyard,
where she can breathe the air from the moors.

1439
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:37,070
Her husband's grave is next to hers.

1440
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:41,750
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Isabella escapes

1441
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:53,550
1784 That Friday evening the wind changed,
and brought first rain, then snow.

1442
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:59,430
Next morning the spring flowers were all hidden
under deep snow.

1443
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:01,840
Mr Edgar stayed in his room.

1444
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:08,869
I was in the sitting-room with the baby, when
I was surprised to hear a girl's voice behind

1445
01:54:08,869 --> 01:54:10,599
me.

1446
01:54:10,599 --> 01:54:15,869
I turned round, and saw it was Isabella Heathcliff.

1447
01:54:15,869 --> 01:54:18,869
I was quite shocked by her appearance.

1448
01:54:18,869 --> 01:54:24,120
Her hair was loose, and wet with snow and
rain.

1449
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:30,440
She wore a light silk dress and thin shoes,
which did not seem at all suitable for a long

1450
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,599
walk in the snow.

1451
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:38,480
Under her ear was a deep wound, which was
bleeding.

1452
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:43,679
Her face was scratched and bruised, and she
looked very tired.

1453
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:48,250
I could see that she was expecting a baby.

1454
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:55,730
'I've run all the way here from Wuthering
Heights,' she said, gasping for breath.

1455
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:59,780
'I couldn't count how many times I've fallen
down!

1456
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:06,380
Ellen, please ask a maid to find some dry
clothes for me, and then I'll go on to the

1457
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:07,380
village.

1458
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,130
I'm not staying here.'

1459
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:15,910
'First, my dear young lady,' I told her, 'you'll
get warm and dry, and I'll put a bandage on

1460
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,619
that wound.

1461
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:20,599
Then we'll have some tea.'

1462
01:55:20,599 --> 01:55:27,429
She was so exhausted that she let me help
her without protesting, and finally we sat

1463
01:55:27,429 --> 01:55:31,650
down together near the fire with our cups
of tea.

1464
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:40,630
'Oh, Ellen,' she said, 'I cried bitterly when
I heard of Catherine's death, you know.

1465
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:43,440
And Heathcliff is desperately sad!

1466
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:46,500
But I can't feel sorry for him.

1467
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:53,380
This is the last thing of his I've got,' and
she took off her gold wedding-ring and threw

1468
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,380
it in the fire.

1469
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,000
I'll never go back to him.

1470
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,300
But I can't stay here, in case he comes to
find me.

1471
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:09,110
And anyway I don't want to beg for Edgar's
help, or make trouble for him.

1472
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:13,710
To escape from Heathcliff I must go a long
way away.

1473
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:17,250
How could Catherine have liked him, Ellen?

1474
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:20,429
I wish he would die, and then I could forget
him completely!'

1475
01:56:20,429 --> 01:56:23,889
'Don't say that,' I protested, he's a human
being.

1476
01:56:23,889 --> 01:56:28,289
There are worse men than him in the world!'

1477
01:56:28,289 --> 01:56:32,120
'He isn't human,' she replied.

1478
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:38,920
'I gave him my heart, and he destroyed it,
so I can't feel pity for him.

1479
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:42,360
But I must tell you how I managed to escape.

1480
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:49,760
Hindley Earnshaw should have been at Catherine's
burial yesterday, but he had been drinking

1481
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,620
so much that he couldn't go.

1482
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:59,570
Last night he and I were sitting silently
in the kitchen at about midnight, when Heathcliff

1483
01:56:59,570 --> 01:57:00,840
came home.

1484
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:07,469
Hindley decided to lock the doors so that
Heathcliff could not get in.

1485
01:57:07,469 --> 01:57:14,500
He told me his plan was to murder his hated
guest that night, with the weapon he had shown

1486
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,500
me.

1487
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:22,869
I hate Heathcliff too, but I could not agree
to murder, so I called out a warning from

1488
01:57:22,869 --> 01:57:24,659
the kitchen window.

1489
01:57:24,659 --> 01:57:30,300
Heathcliff swore horribly at me and broke
one of the windows.

1490
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:35,561
Hindley put his right arm out through the
hole, with the gun in it, and aimed it at

1491
01:57:35,561 --> 01:57:36,561
his enemy.

1492
01:57:36,561 --> 01:57:43,429
But before he could fire, Heathcliff caught
hold of the gun and pulled it away from Hindley.

1493
01:57:43,429 --> 01:57:49,719
The knife cut into Hindley's wrist, and blood
poured out.

1494
01:57:49,719 --> 01:57:55,010
Heathcliff jumped into the kitchen through
the window, and started kicking and hitting

1495
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:59,039
Hindley, who was lying unconscious on the
kitchen floor.

1496
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:02,920
I ran off to find Joseph.

1497
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:09,680
When we came back, Heathcliff was putting
a bandage on Hindley's wrist.

1498
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:15,800
Joseph was shocked at the sight of his master,
and would have gone to the police, if Heathcliff

1499
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,790
hadn't forced me to describe what happened.

1500
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:24,159
I had to agree that Hindley had certainly
attacked Heathcliff first.

1501
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:32,450
The next day, I decided to have my revenge
on Heathcliff, by telling Hindley that 'that

1502
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:35,641
devil' had hit and kicked him when he was
unconscious.

1503
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:42,851
And I told Heathcliff to his face that he
could never have made Catherine happy, if

1504
01:58:42,851 --> 01:58:45,310
she had been his wife.

1505
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:51,809
This made him so angry that he threw a knife
at me, which cut my neck, and then he rushed

1506
01:58:51,809 --> 01:58:54,100
towards me, swearing violently.

1507
01:58:54,100 --> 01:59:02,099
I knew I had to get away quickly, and as I
ran out of the kitchen, I saw Hindley attack

1508
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:03,099
Heathcliff.

1509
01:59:03,099 --> 01:59:06,469
Both of them were rolling on the floor, fighting.

1510
01:59:06,469 --> 01:59:10,550
I came over the moors through the snow to
the Grange.

1511
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:13,400
At last I'm free!

1512
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:19,139
And I shall never, never spend another night
at Wuthering Heights.'

1513
01:59:19,139 --> 01:59:25,469
After drinking her tea, Isabella left the
Grange.

1514
01:59:25,469 --> 01:59:32,130
From our village she travelled by coach to
the south, where she made her new home near

1515
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:33,130
London.

1516
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:38,449
There, a few months later, she had a son.

1517
01:59:38,449 --> 01:59:42,150
She called him Linton.

1518
01:59:42,150 --> 01:59:46,349
Heathcliff must have discovered this from
the servants.

1519
01:59:46,349 --> 01:59:53,590
One day when I saw him in the village, he
said, 'I hear I've got a son, Ellen, whose

1520
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:55,960
name's Linton!

1521
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:58,429
I suppose Isabella wants me to hate him!

1522
01:59:58,429 --> 02:00:01,770
She can keep him for the moment.

1523
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:06,770
But tell Edgar Linton I'll have the boy one
day!

1524
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:08,829
He's mine!'

1525
02:00:08,829 --> 02:00:16,369
After Catherine's death my poor master, Mr
Edgar, was a changed man.

1526
02:00:16,369 --> 02:00:20,380
He no longer went to church, or saw any friends.

1527
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:28,250
He occasionally went for lonely walks on the
moors, and regularly visited his wife's grave.

1528
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:36,130
But fortunately Catherine had left him something
of herself, her daughter Cathy.

1529
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:39,720
This tiny child soon won his heart.

1530
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:44,619
It's strange, Mr Lockwood, to compare Hindley
and Edgar.

1531
02:00:44,619 --> 02:00:49,460
They both lost their wives, and were left
with a child.

1532
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:54,170
Hindley did not believe in God, and showed
no interest in his son Hareton.

1533
02:00:54,170 --> 02:01:00,579
But Edgar believed, and loved his daughter
Cathy deeply.

1534
02:01:00,579 --> 02:01:05,969
Hindley himself died six months after his
sister Catherine.

1535
02:01:05,969 --> 02:01:12,949
We never discovered exactly what happened,
but Heathcliff said he had drunk himself to

1536
02:01:12,949 --> 02:01:13,949
death.

1537
02:01:13,949 --> 02:01:20,460
It appeared that Heathcliff had won Hindley's
house, land and money from him when playing

1538
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:25,719
cards, so he was now the master of Wuthering
Heights.

1539
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:31,261
Hareton inherited nothing from his father,
and could only stay on at Wuthering Heights

1540
02:01:31,261 --> 02:01:39,510
as a servant, working for the man who had
been his father's enemy.

1541
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:43,500
CHAPTER TWELVE
Bringing up Cathy

1542
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:54,710
1797 During the next twelve years I was happier
than I had ever been before.

1543
02:01:54,710 --> 02:02:01,619
All my time was spent looking after little
Cathy, who brought sunshine into our lives.

1544
02:02:01,619 --> 02:02:08,929
She was a real beauty, with the Earnshaws'
dark eyes and the Lintons' fair skin.

1545
02:02:08,929 --> 02:02:13,780
She wasn't as proud and quick-tempered as
her mother, but she was used to getting what

1546
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:14,960
she wanted.

1547
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:22,670
Her father loved her so much that he gave
her everything, and never scolded her.

1548
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:28,340
Until she was thirteen she had never been
outside the Grange garden alone.

1549
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:34,030
She knew nothing of Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff.

1550
02:02:34,030 --> 02:02:39,559
She often asked me about the hills in the
distance, beyond the moors, and wanted to

1551
02:02:39,559 --> 02:02:41,829
ride her pony there.

1552
02:02:41,829 --> 02:02:50,179
I knew the master would not let her leave
the safety of the Grange to go so far, especially

1553
02:02:50,179 --> 02:02:55,100
as the road to the hills passed close to Wuthering
Heights.

1554
02:02:55,100 --> 02:03:00,550
So I always told her she would be able to
go there when she was older.

1555
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:05,829
I did not know what she was planning.

1556
02:03:05,829 --> 02:03:10,150
Mr Edgar received a letter from his sister
Isabella.

1557
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:16,989
She wrote that she was dying of a fever, and
asked him to visit her for the first and last

1558
02:03:16,989 --> 02:03:18,820
time.

1559
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:26,940
She also wanted him to take care of her son
Linton after her death.

1560
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:32,869
Although my master hated travelling, he did
not hesitate to do as she requested.

1561
02:03:32,869 --> 02:03:39,469
He told me to look after Cathy carefully,
and left at once.

1562
02:03:39,469 --> 02:03:42,870
He was away for three weeks.

1563
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:47,320
Cathy did not cause me any trouble at first.

1564
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:53,550
She spent her days walking her dogs and riding
her pony in the large garden.

1565
02:03:53,550 --> 02:04:02,969
But one day she asked if she could stay out
the whole day, and away she went on her little

1566
02:04:02,969 --> 02:04:06,880
pony, with her two dogs running behind.

1567
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:13,579
There was no sign of her at tea-time, and
I began to be seriously worried.

1568
02:04:13,579 --> 02:04:16,730
I went outside to look for her.

1569
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:24,750
At the gate I found a workman, who had seen
her jump the low wall separating the garden

1570
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:30,300
from the road, and then ride on towards the
hills and Wuthering Heights.

1571
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:33,489
I was very frightened now.

1572
02:04:33,489 --> 02:04:35,760
She could be lost on the moors!

1573
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:40,469
She could have tried to climb the hills, and
fallen!

1574
02:04:40,469 --> 02:04:48,239
I walked across the moors as fast as I could,
and arrived breathless at Wuthering Heights.

1575
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:53,659
How glad I was to see one of her dogs lying
outside the kitchen door!

1576
02:04:53,659 --> 02:04:58,000
I knocked loudly, and Zillah let me in.

1577
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,869
I knew she had been the housekeeper there
since Hindley's death.

1578
02:05:03,869 --> 02:05:08,969
'Ah,' she said, 'you've come for your little
mistress!

1579
02:05:08,969 --> 02:05:11,240
She's here, quite safe!

1580
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:14,059
The master, Mr Heathcliff, isn't here.

1581
02:05:14,059 --> 02:05:17,280
He won't be back for a while.'

1582
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:24,160
Cathy was sitting comfortably in the kitchen,
talking eagerly to Hareton.

1583
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:32,449
He was now a big, strong young man of eighteen,
who was staring rather stupidly at her.

1584
02:05:32,449 --> 02:05:39,579
I was delighted to find her again, but I pretended
to be angry to punish her.

1585
02:05:39,579 --> 02:05:41,840
'Well, miss!

1586
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:46,219
You are wicked, going such a long way all
alone!

1587
02:05:46,219 --> 02:05:50,690
I've been all over the moors looking for you!

1588
02:05:50,690 --> 02:05:52,889
Your father will be angry!'

1589
02:05:52,889 --> 02:05:56,820
'What have I done?'

1590
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:59,140
she sobbed, suddenly frightened.

1591
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:03,480
'Father didn't forbid me to leave the Grange
garden!

1592
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,909
He won't scold me, Ellen.

1593
02:06:06,909 --> 02:06:10,340
He's never cross, like you!

1594
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:12,670
And I've been to the hills, Ellen!

1595
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:18,389
This - man - showed me, because I didn't know
the way.'

1596
02:06:18,389 --> 02:06:22,090
I made her put on her hat and prepare to leave.

1597
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:24,989
'Whose house is this?'

1598
02:06:24,989 --> 02:06:26,449
she asked suddenly.

1599
02:06:26,449 --> 02:06:29,900
'It's your father's, isn't it?'

1600
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,599
she added, turning to Hareton.

1601
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,480
'No,' he replied, looking down.

1602
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:39,360
His face went very red.

1603
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,469
'Whose then - your master's?'

1604
02:06:42,469 --> 02:06:43,789
she asked.

1605
02:06:43,789 --> 02:06:46,019
He swore, and turned away.

1606
02:06:46,019 --> 02:06:50,820
'Ellen, he didn't say "miss" to me.

1607
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:54,770
Servants should always say "miss", shouldn't
they?'

1608
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:59,880
Hareton frowned and looked very angry, but
said nothing.

1609
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:04,820
'You, get my horse,' she ordered him.

1610
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,820
'Hurry!'

1611
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:09,850
'What the devil do you mean?

1612
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:13,170
I'm not your servant!' he growled.

1613
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:15,370
'You see, Miss Cathy?

1614
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:18,770
Nice words to be used to a young lady!

1615
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:24,920
Now come along, let's fetch the pony and leave,'
I said.

1616
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:32,650
'But Ellen,' she cried, staring horrified
at him, 'how dare he speak to me like that!

1617
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:35,900
He must do as I tell him!'

1618
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:41,760
'He's not your servant, miss,' said Zillah,
who had been listening to the conversation.

1619
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:42,760
'He's your cousin.'

1620
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:43,760
'He can't be my cousin!'

1621
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:50,150
cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.

1622
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:53,280
'Father has gone to fetch my cousin from London.

1623
02:07:53,280 --> 02:08:03,239
He's a gentleman's son, not - not a farm worker
like him!'

1624
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:08,960
She pointed at poor Hareton, whose clothes
were old and dirty.

1625
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,449
I was very annoyed with her and Zillah.

1626
02:08:12,449 --> 02:08:18,300
Now Heathcliff would hear about his son's
arrival, which we had hoped to keep secret

1627
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:19,300
from him.

1628
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:25,610
And Cathy would certainly ask her father whether
she had a cousin at Wuthering Heights.

1629
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:33,210
On our way home I explained to her that if
her father discovered she had visited Wuthering

1630
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:40,430
Heights, he would perhaps be so angry with
me that he would send me away.

1631
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:49,719
She could not bear to think of that, so she
promised to keep her visit a secret from him.

1632
02:08:49,719 --> 02:08:55,960
We heard from Mr Edgar that his sister had
died, and that he was returning soon with

1633
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,599
his young nephew.

1634
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:01,280
Cathy was wild with excitement.

1635
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:08,130
She would see her dear father again, and have
a cousin of the same age to play with.

1636
02:09:08,130 --> 02:09:15,599
But when the coach arrived, young Linton had
to be carried into the house.

1637
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:21,349
He was a pale, thin boy, who looked very like
Mr Edgar.

1638
02:09:21,349 --> 02:09:26,480
He seemed so weak that I wondered how long
he would live.

1639
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:32,679
I thought he would have no chance of life
if his father Heathcliff took him to live

1640
02:09:32,679 --> 02:09:34,880
at Wuthering Heights.

1641
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:39,770
In fact Linton only stayed one night with
us.

1642
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:46,210
Later that evening Heathcliffs servant Joseph
arrived and asked to speak to the master.

1643
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:55,449
Although it was late and Mr Edgar was tired
after his journey, Joseph insisted, so I took

1644
02:09:55,449 --> 02:09:57,159
him to the master's room.

1645
02:09:57,159 --> 02:10:05,650
'Heathcliff has sent me for his son, and I
can't go back without him,' he said.

1646
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:07,789
Mr Edgar was silent for a moment.

1647
02:10:07,789 --> 02:10:12,280
On his face was an expression of deep sadness.

1648
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:17,890
He had hoped to keep Linton with him, as Isabella
had wished.

1649
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:21,820
But he could not refuse the boy's father.

1650
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:29,381
'Tell Mr Heathcliff,' he said calmly, that
Ellen will take his son to Wuthering Heights

1651
02:10:29,381 --> 02:10:31,210
tomorrow.

1652
02:10:31,210 --> 02:10:35,599
He's asleep at the moment, and I won't disturb
him.'

1653
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:40,230
'No!' said Joseph, banging the table with
his hand.

1654
02:10:40,230 --> 02:10:44,290
'I must take him back now!'

1655
02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:45,869
'Not tonight!'

1656
02:10:45,869 --> 02:10:47,780
answered Mr Edgar.

1657
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:52,889
'Leave the house now, and tell your master
what I said!'

1658
02:10:52,889 --> 02:10:54,510
'Very well!'

1659
02:10:54,510 --> 02:10:57,019
shouted Joseph, as he walked out.

1660
02:10:57,019 --> 02:11:06,800
'If he doesn't arrive early in the morning,
Heathcliff will come for him!'

1661
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:11,659
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Heathcliffs son at Wuthering Heights

1662
02:11:11,659 --> 02:11:21,630
1797 Linton was very surprised to be woken
so early, and told that he had another journey

1663
02:11:21,630 --> 02:11:24,570
to make, before breakfast.

1664
02:11:24,570 --> 02:11:31,429
As we rode the four miles to Wuthering Heights,
he kept asking me questions about his new

1665
02:11:31,429 --> 02:11:36,309
home, and the father he had never seen.

1666
02:11:36,309 --> 02:11:43,469
When we arrived, Heathcliff, Hareton, and
Joseph all came out of the house to inspect

1667
02:11:43,469 --> 02:11:45,020
the child.

1668
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:51,909
'Master, that's not a boy,' said Joseph after
a while.

1669
02:11:51,909 --> 02:11:54,310
'Look at that white skin and fair hair!

1670
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:58,980
Mr Edgar's sent you his daughter instead!'

1671
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:00,800
'God!

1672
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,949
What a beautiful creature!'

1673
02:12:02,949 --> 02:12:04,780
laughed Heathcliff scornfully.

1674
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:09,730
'That's worse than I expected!'

1675
02:12:09,730 --> 02:12:15,250
I helped the trembling child off the horse
and into the house.

1676
02:12:15,250 --> 02:12:19,150
Heathcliff took him roughly by the arm.

1677
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:24,710
'I hope you'll be kind to him, Mr Heathcliff,'
I said.

1678
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:26,920
He's weak, and ill.

1679
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,530
And he's all the family you've got!'

1680
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:35,790
'Don't worry, Ellen,' replied Heathcliff with
a smile.

1681
02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:42,670
As Isabella's son he'll inherit Thrushcross
Grange one day, and I don't want him to die

1682
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:43,809
before that.

1683
02:12:43,809 --> 02:12:47,730
He'll be educated as a gentleman.

1684
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:55,820
But I'm bitterly disappointed at having such
a weak, crying baby for a son!'

1685
02:12:55,820 --> 02:13:00,220
So poor Linton was left in his father's care.

1686
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:07,389
At first Cathy was miserable, because she
would not now have anyone to play with, but

1687
02:13:07,389 --> 02:13:09,630
she soon forgot him.

1688
02:13:09,630 --> 02:13:15,770
Whenever I met Zillah, the housekeeper, in
the village, I used to ask her about Linton.

1689
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:18,869
'He's often ill,' she told me.

1690
02:13:18,869 --> 02:13:19,869
'And so selfish!

1691
02:13:19,869 --> 02:13:23,309
He has to have a fire even in summer!

1692
02:13:23,309 --> 02:13:27,760
He calls for cakes and hot drinks all the
time.

1693
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:31,139
He only ever thinks of himself.

1694
02:13:31,139 --> 02:13:37,429
Mr Heathcliff can't bear being in the same
room as him!'

1695
02:13:37,429 --> 02:13:41,160
Several years passed without any more news
of Linton.

1696
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:47,090
In 1800 Cathy reached the age of sixteen.

1697
02:13:47,090 --> 02:13:53,710
We never celebrated her birthday, because
it was also the day her mother died.

1698
02:13:53,710 --> 02:14:00,739
On this particular day she came downstairs,
dressed for going out, and suggested a walk

1699
02:14:00,739 --> 02:14:02,560
on the moors with me.

1700
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:06,200
Her father gave permission.

1701
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:12,380
It was a lovely spring morning, and I was
very happy walking in the sunshine, watching

1702
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:14,860
Cathy running ahead of me.

1703
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:22,090
But we had walked further than I had realized,
and I called to her to come back.

1704
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:25,030
She did not seem to hear me.

1705
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:31,940
We were on the moors, close to Wuthering Heights,
when I caught sight of two men talking to

1706
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:33,219
her.

1707
02:14:33,219 --> 02:14:38,260
I recognized Heathcliff and Hareton at once.

1708
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:41,530
I hurried to catch up with her.

1709
02:14:41,530 --> 02:14:46,230
'Miss Cathy,' I said breathlessly, 'we must
go home.

1710
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:50,489
Your father will be getting worried.'

1711
02:14:50,489 --> 02:14:53,280
'No, he won't, Ellen.

1712
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:56,630
This gentleman wants me to go to his house
and meet his son.

1713
02:14:56,630 --> 02:15:02,510
He says we've already met, but I don't remember,
do you?

1714
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:05,989
Let's go, Ellen!'

1715
02:15:05,989 --> 02:15:12,190
Although I protested, she and Hareton were
already halfway to Wuthering Heights.

1716
02:15:12,190 --> 02:15:14,880
Heathcliff and I followed behind.

1717
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:20,909
'It's very bad of you, Mr Heathcliff,' I scolded
him.

1718
02:15:20,909 --> 02:15:25,139
'Mr Edgar will blame me for letting her go
to your house.'

1719
02:15:25,139 --> 02:15:30,809
'I want her to see Linton, Ellen,' he replied.

1720
02:15:30,809 --> 02:15:32,530
'Listen to my plan.

1721
02:15:32,530 --> 02:15:36,830
It's really a very generous one.

1722
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:42,769
I want the two cousins to fall in love and
marry.

1723
02:15:42,769 --> 02:15:47,099
You know Cathy won't inherit anything from
her father.

1724
02:15:47,099 --> 02:15:53,310
My son Linton will inherit all the Linton
fortune when Edgar dies.

1725
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:56,090
If she marries Linton, she'll be wealthy.

1726
02:15:56,090 --> 02:16:05,610
Of course, if Linton dies, then the money
comes to me, as his only other relation.'

1727
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:11,769
I was still angry with Heathcliff, but it
was too late to stop Cathy entering Wuthering

1728
02:16:11,769 --> 02:16:12,909
Heights.

1729
02:16:12,909 --> 02:16:20,860
She was delighted to rediscover her cousin
Linton, who was keeping warm by the fire.

1730
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:29,130
'If he is my cousin, and you are his father,'
she said to Heathcliff, smiling, then you

1731
02:16:29,130 --> 02:16:30,199
must be my uncle!

1732
02:16:30,199 --> 02:16:34,270
Why don't you ever visit us at the Grange?'

1733
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:41,461
'I visited it once or twice too often before
you were born,' he said.

1734
02:16:41,461 --> 02:16:46,820
'I must tell you that I quarrelled violently
with your father once.

1735
02:16:46,820 --> 02:16:54,230
He hates me, and if you tell him you want
to come here, he'll forbid it.'

1736
02:16:54,230 --> 02:17:01,170
'Well, if I can't come here, Linton can come
to visit me at the Grange,' suggested Cathy

1737
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:02,170
happily.

1738
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:07,670
'It'll be too far for me,' said her cousin
weakly.

1739
02:17:07,670 --> 02:17:10,790
'It would kill me to walk four miles.'

1740
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:16,130
Heathcliff looked scornfully at his son.

1741
02:17:16,130 --> 02:17:22,150
'I don't think my plan will ever succeed,
Ellen!' he whispered to me.

1742
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:26,600
'Who would fall in love with a selfish baby
like that?'

1743
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:29,920
He went to the kitchen door and called, Hareton!

1744
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:34,100
Come and take Miss Cathy round the farm.'

1745
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:40,051
Cathy was eager to see the animals, and she
and Hareton went out.

1746
02:17:40,051 --> 02:17:46,940
As we watched them through the kitchen window,
Heathcliff seemed to be thinking aloud.

1747
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:54,840
'I've taken my revenge on his father, by making
Hareton work for me.

1748
02:17:54,840 --> 02:18:02,110
I treat him badly, as they used to do to me,
and he suffers, as I used to.

1749
02:18:02,110 --> 02:18:09,961
He's intelligent, and strong, and handsome,
but I've taught him to scorn those qualities.

1750
02:18:09,961 --> 02:18:18,570
So now he's just an uneducated farm worker,
and knows nothing of the world.

1751
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:22,000
That's how he'll always be.

1752
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,190
And my son?

1753
02:18:24,190 --> 02:18:27,960
He's stupid, and weak, and ill.

1754
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:36,740
But he's a gentleman, and he'll marry Cathy,
and he'll be rich!'

1755
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:43,020
Meanwhile Linton had got up from his armchair
and gone out to join Cathy and Hareton.

1756
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:49,480
Through the open window I could hear the two
younger ones laughing at Hareton's coarse

1757
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:51,030
way of speaking.

1758
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:56,420
I began to dislike Linton rather than pity
him.

1759
02:18:56,420 --> 02:19:02,190
When we arrived back at the Grange, Cathy
told her father about the visit.

1760
02:19:02,190 --> 02:19:08,970
He did not want to frighten her, and, in my
opinion, did not explain clearly enough why

1761
02:19:08,970 --> 02:19:11,980
she should never communicate with Linton again.

1762
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:17,640
At the time she seemed to accept her father's
wish.

1763
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:25,650
During the next few weeks, however, I noticed
Cathy's behaviour change.

1764
02:19:25,650 --> 02:19:32,000
She was always writing on little pieces of
paper, which she kept in a locked drawer in

1765
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:39,350
her room, and every morning she got up surprisingly
early to go down to the kitchen.

1766
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:47,850
I suspected something, and one day I decided
to break open her drawer.

1767
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:55,681
In it I was horrified to find a whole pile
of love letters from Linton.

1768
02:19:55,681 --> 02:20:03,790
The two cousins had been writing to each other
in secret for several weeks, and Cathy had

1769
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:06,681
used the milkman as a messenger.

1770
02:20:06,681 --> 02:20:15,311
I told her at once that I knew her secret,
and made her promise not to send or receive

1771
02:20:15,311 --> 02:20:17,630
any more letters.

1772
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:25,500
We burnt Linton's letters together.

1773
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:28,580
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Secret visits

1774
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:36,891
1800 The months passed, and soon it was autumn.

1775
02:20:36,891 --> 02:20:43,540
Mr Edgar caught a bad cold, which seemed to
get worse and worse.

1776
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:53,080
He stayed indoors the whole winter, so Cathy
only had me as a companion on her walks.

1777
02:20:53,080 --> 02:21:00,400
She had become very quiet and sad since her
relationship with Linton had ended, and was

1778
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:04,330
very worried about her father's illness.

1779
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:10,641
One day when we were walking in the Grange
garden, I noticed her crying.

1780
02:21:10,641 --> 02:21:13,340
'Cathy, what's the matter, love?'

1781
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:15,460
I asked.

1782
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:22,854
'Oh, Ellen,' she sobbed, what shall I do if
Father dies?

1783
02:21:22,854 --> 02:21:24,391
And if you die?

1784
02:21:24,391 --> 02:21:30,110
I'll be left alone!'

1785
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:37,620
'I hope he and I have years more of life ahead
of us.

1786
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:43,820
All you need do is look after your father;
and let him see you're cheerful.

1787
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:52,170
But I think he would be really ill if he thought
you loved Linton, whose father would like

1788
02:21:52,170 --> 02:21:56,061
to see Mr Edgar dead.'

1789
02:21:56,061 --> 02:22:03,200
'I'll never, never do anything to worry or
annoy Father,' she promised.

1790
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:06,870
I only want him to recover.

1791
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:16,171
I love him more than anyone else in the world,
more than myself!'

1792
02:22:16,171 --> 02:22:23,570
Just then we reached the gate, and I saw a
gentleman on a horse looking over it.

1793
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:26,021
It was Heathcliff.

1794
02:22:26,021 --> 02:22:29,291
'Miss Linton!' he called.

1795
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:31,320
'There's something I must tell you!'

1796
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:33,830
'I won't listen,' answered Cathy.

1797
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:40,080
Father and Ellen both say you're a wicked
man.'

1798
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:45,330
'But this is about my son Linton, not me.

1799
02:22:45,330 --> 02:22:48,540
What a trick you played on him!

1800
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:57,190
You wrote him all those love letters, and
then I suppose you got tired of it, and stopped!

1801
02:22:57,190 --> 02:23:01,130
Well, you've broken poor Linton's heart.

1802
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:07,500
I swear, he's dying of love for you, and he'll
be in the grave by next summer unless you

1803
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,960
help him!

1804
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:12,721
Be generous, come and visit him.

1805
02:23:12,721 --> 02:23:20,410
I'll be away all next week, so your father
won't be angry if you come.'

1806
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:22,450
He rode away.

1807
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:30,050
Although I tried to persuade Cathy that Heathcliff
could not be telling the truth, my young mistress

1808
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:35,920
was very upset, and determined to discover
how Linton was.

1809
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:41,250
The next morning we rode to Wuthering Heights.

1810
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:46,101
We found Linton alone, lying on a sofa.

1811
02:23:46,101 --> 02:23:51,300
He looked feverish and ill, and had a bad
cough.

1812
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:57,240
'Will you shut the door?' he said crossly,
as we entered.

1813
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:58,721
'It's so cold!

1814
02:23:58,721 --> 02:24:03,061
No, Cathy, I can't breathe if you kiss me!

1815
02:24:03,061 --> 02:24:05,260
I want a drink.'

1816
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:08,811
Cathy poured him a glass of water.

1817
02:24:08,811 --> 02:24:12,730
'And are you glad to see me, Linton?'

1818
02:24:12,730 --> 02:24:14,480
she asked hopefully.

1819
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:18,431
'Yes, I am,' he replied.

1820
02:24:18,431 --> 02:24:19,961
'But you should have come before!

1821
02:24:19,961 --> 02:24:25,351
My father swore at me, and said it was my
fault you didn't come.

1822
02:24:25,351 --> 02:24:28,551
Will you come and visit me again?'

1823
02:24:28,551 --> 02:24:34,230
'Yes, Linton,' Cathy said gently, holding
his hand.

1824
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:40,181
If Father agreed, I'd spend half my time with
you.

1825
02:24:40,181 --> 02:24:44,840
I wish you were my brother, then we could
spend all our time together!'

1826
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:53,700
'But my father says you would love me best
if you were my wife, so that would be better.'

1827
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:59,480
'I'd never love anybody more than Father,'
she replied seriously.

1828
02:24:59,480 --> 02:25:05,051
'Sometimes men hate their wives, like your
father.

1829
02:25:05,051 --> 02:25:09,190
He hated your mother, my aunt Isabella.

1830
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:11,070
That's why she left him.'

1831
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:14,080
'That's not true!'

1832
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:16,340
cried the boy.

1833
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:19,330
'Anyway, your mother hated your father!

1834
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:21,250
And she loved mine!'

1835
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:23,101
'You're lying!

1836
02:25:23,101 --> 02:25:25,750
I hate you!'

1837
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:31,290
she shouted angrily, and gave the sofa a violent
push.

1838
02:25:31,290 --> 02:25:37,641
He fell back, and started coughing so badly
that even I was frightened.

1839
02:25:37,641 --> 02:25:41,101
At last he recovered.

1840
02:25:41,101 --> 02:25:47,370
Cathy was crying in a corner, afraid that
she had really hurt him.

1841
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:51,681
'How do you feel now, Linton?'

1842
02:25:51,681 --> 02:25:54,290
she asked after a while.

1843
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:58,541
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.'

1844
02:25:58,541 --> 02:26:03,820
'I wish you felt as ill as I do, you cruel
thing!

1845
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:08,920
And I was better today, before you came!'

1846
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:11,730
His voice was full of pity for himself.

1847
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:14,940
'We must go,' I said.

1848
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:19,750
'You can see, Miss Cathy, that he isn't dying
of love for you!

1849
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:22,690
It's not your fault that he's ill.

1850
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:24,311
Come along!'

1851
02:26:24,311 --> 02:26:32,750
But I could not stop Cathy whispering something
in Linton's ear, before we left the room.

1852
02:26:32,750 --> 02:26:38,341
On the way home I told her I would not allow
her to visit him again.

1853
02:26:38,341 --> 02:26:45,261
'He's a selfish child, Miss Cathy, and I don't
think he'll live till he's twenty.

1854
02:26:45,261 --> 02:26:47,710
I'm glad you're not going to marry him.'

1855
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:50,320
'Cathy looked sad.

1856
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:54,190
I'm sure he'd recover if I looked after him.

1857
02:26:54,190 --> 02:27:00,091
And I don't think we'd quarrel if we knew
each other better.'

1858
02:27:00,091 --> 02:27:07,690
'Well, miss, if you try to go there again,
with or without me, I'll tell your father.'

1859
02:27:07,690 --> 02:27:15,860
But the next day I fell ill, and had to stay
in bed for three weeks, which was very unusual

1860
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:17,311
for me.

1861
02:27:17,311 --> 02:27:24,320
My little mistress went from her father's
bedroom to mine, and back again, and looked

1862
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:28,421
after us both with the greatest care.

1863
02:27:28,421 --> 02:27:36,010
But I never wondered what she did in the evenings,
when Mr Edgar had gone to bed, and I no longer

1864
02:27:36,010 --> 02:27:38,210
needed her.

1865
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:45,130
I only discovered the truth on the first day
I was able to get up.

1866
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:52,351
In the evening I asked her to read to me,
and was surprised how sleepy she seemed.

1867
02:27:52,351 --> 02:27:54,101
She went to bed early.

1868
02:27:54,101 --> 02:28:01,500
I felt rather worried about her health, and
went to her room an hour later to see if she

1869
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:03,210
needed anything.

1870
02:28:03,210 --> 02:28:06,301
Her bedroom was empty.

1871
02:28:06,301 --> 02:28:13,230
I sat there in the dark, waiting for her to
return.

1872
02:28:13,230 --> 02:28:20,290
When she arrived, shaking the snow off her
shoes, she was shocked to find me there.

1873
02:28:20,290 --> 02:28:26,721
I guessed where she had been, but I made her
tell me the whole story.

1874
02:28:26,721 --> 02:28:34,150
Every night since I had been ill, she had
ridden to Wuthering Heights and spent the

1875
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:37,410
evening with her cousin.

1876
02:28:37,410 --> 02:28:43,740
Sometimes she was happy with Linton, when
he was cheerful and less selfish, but most

1877
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:45,900
of the time she was miserable.

1878
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:53,730
However, she insisted that the visits should
continue, because Linton needed her, and she

1879
02:28:53,730 --> 02:28:56,580
wanted to see him.

1880
02:28:56,580 --> 02:29:02,672
Although she begged me to say nothing to her
father, I went straight to the master and

1881
02:29:02,672 --> 02:29:03,950
told him.

1882
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:08,681
He forbade her to visit Wuthering Heights
again.

1883
02:29:08,681 --> 02:29:13,811
She had to obey her father, although it made
her very sad.

1884
02:29:13,811 --> 02:29:20,030
Well, Mr Lockwood, all this happened only
about a year ago.

1885
02:29:20,030 --> 02:29:24,311
I never thought I would be telling a stranger
this story!

1886
02:29:24,311 --> 02:29:27,141
But who knows how long you'll be a stranger?

1887
02:29:27,141 --> 02:29:33,920
You're too young to live alone for long, and
no one could see Cathy and not love her.

1888
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:38,450
Anyway, I'll continue my story.'

1889
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:45,730
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
A Trap

1890
02:29:45,730 --> 02:29:55,950
1800 A Few days after the master had forbidden
Cathy to visit Linton, he asked my opinion

1891
02:29:55,950 --> 02:29:57,490
of the boy.

1892
02:29:57,490 --> 02:30:04,620
'Tell me honestly, Ellen, what do you think
of his character?'

1893
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:09,730
'Well, sir, I don't think he's wicked, like
his father.

1894
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:14,030
But you'll have plenty of time to get to know
him, sir.

1895
02:30:14,030 --> 02:30:16,590
He's too young to marry yet.'

1896
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:22,090
Mr Edgar walked to the window and looked out.

1897
02:30:22,090 --> 02:30:29,790
It was a misty February evening, but the churchyard
was just visible.

1898
02:30:29,790 --> 02:30:33,280
'I've often prayed for death, Ellen.

1899
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:36,500
I've been very happy with my little Cathy.

1900
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:43,880
But I've been just as happy lying, through
the long June evenings, on her mother's grave,

1901
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:48,210
and looking forward to the moment when I can
join Catherine there!

1902
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:51,641
I haven't got much time left, Ellen.

1903
02:30:51,641 --> 02:30:55,541
What can I do for Cathy before I die?

1904
02:30:55,541 --> 02:30:57,750
Should she marry Linton?

1905
02:30:57,750 --> 02:31:03,250
I wouldn't mind him being Heathcliffs son,
if only he loved her and could be a good husband

1906
02:31:03,250 --> 02:31:04,250
to her.'

1907
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:11,121
'God will show us what to do, sir,' I replied.

1908
02:31:11,121 --> 02:31:18,070
In the spring Mr Edgar was still ill, and
he continued to worry about Cathy's future.

1909
02:31:18,070 --> 02:31:25,761
One day he wrote to Linton inviting him to
visit the Grange.

1910
02:31:25,761 --> 02:31:31,480
Linton wrote a long letter back, explaining
that his father would not allow him to do

1911
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:32,480
that.

1912
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:39,370
He begged his uncle to let him meet Cathy
for a walk or a ride on the moors between

1913
02:31:39,370 --> 02:31:44,891
the Grange and Wuthering Heights, as they
could not meet in either house.

1914
02:31:44,891 --> 02:31:54,230
Mr Edgar refused at first, and Linton sent
him several more letters.

1915
02:31:54,230 --> 02:32:02,250
I am sure they had all been carefully checked
by Heathcliff before they were posted.

1916
02:32:02,250 --> 02:32:05,150
Finally Mr Edgar agreed.

1917
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:11,751
He hoped that, if Cathy married Linton, who
would inherit the Linton fortune, she would

1918
02:32:11,751 --> 02:32:16,420
at least be able to remain in her family home.

1919
02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:20,490
He had no idea that Linton was seriously ill.

1920
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:29,670
Neither did I. I never imagined that a father
could treat a dying child as cruelly and wickedly

1921
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:34,080
as we later discovered Heathcliff had done.

1922
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:41,030
It was a hot, sunny day in summer when Cathy
and I rode out to meet her cousin.

1923
02:32:41,030 --> 02:32:47,450
We were both shocked to discover that he could
neither ride nor walk, and was lying on the

1924
02:32:47,450 --> 02:32:49,660
grass, waiting for us.

1925
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:55,610
He looked even paler and weaker than the last
time I had seen him.

1926
02:32:55,610 --> 02:33:02,080
During our meeting he did not seem interested
in Cathy or her news.

1927
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:04,620
Cathy noticed this immediately.

1928
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:12,790
'Well, Linton,' she said after a while, you
don't want to talk to me, so I think I'll

1929
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:14,251
go home.'

1930
02:33:14,251 --> 02:33:18,141
'No, no!' he cried, getting quite excited.

1931
02:33:18,141 --> 02:33:19,360
'Not yet!

1932
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:22,420
Stay - at least another half-hour!

1933
02:33:22,420 --> 02:33:26,880
My father will be angry with me if you leave
early!'

1934
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:32,660
'I suppose we can stay a few minutes longer,'
said Cathy.

1935
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:40,080
We waited, talking to each other quietly while
Linton slept a little.

1936
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:42,931
Sometimes he cried out in pain.

1937
02:33:42,931 --> 02:33:48,641
'Do you think his health is better now than
before?'

1938
02:33:48,641 --> 02:33:49,780
whispered Cathy.

1939
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:56,070
'I'm sorry, Miss Cathy, I think it's much
worse,' I answered.

1940
02:33:56,070 --> 02:34:00,790
Cathy called her pony, and the sound woke
Linton up.

1941
02:34:00,790 --> 02:34:14,760
'If you see my father,' he said, hesitating,
'could you tell him I've been cheerful?

1942
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:19,140
He'll be here soon!'

1943
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:20,140
And he looked round in terror.

1944
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:21,140
'I'll be here next Thursday!'

1945
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:22,271
cried Cathy, as she jumped on her pony.

1946
02:34:22,271 --> 02:34:24,980
Come on, Ellen!'

1947
02:34:24,980 --> 02:34:31,891
In the week that followed, Mr Edgar's illness
grew worse every day.

1948
02:34:31,891 --> 02:34:40,940
Cathy could not avoid realizing how serious
it was, and sat by his bedside day and night,

1949
02:34:40,940 --> 02:34:43,601
looking sad and pale.

1950
02:34:43,601 --> 02:34:48,671
Her father's room had become her whole world.

1951
02:34:48,671 --> 02:34:55,940
On Thursday I thought a ride in the fresh
air would be good for her, and Mr Edgar gladly

1952
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:58,320
gave her permission to see Linton.

1953
02:34:58,320 --> 02:35:02,990
He was hoping that she would not be left alone
after his death.

1954
02:35:02,990 --> 02:35:10,610
I did not want to worry him in his last moments,
so I did not tell him that Linton was also

1955
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:13,471
dying.

1956
02:35:13,471 --> 02:35:20,771
We rode on to the moors and found Linton lying
in the same place as before.

1957
02:35:20,771 --> 02:35:22,791
He was looking very frightened.

1958
02:35:22,791 --> 02:35:27,950
'I thought you weren't going to come!' he
said.

1959
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:32,200
'Why won't you be honest?'

1960
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:33,811
cried Cathy at once.

1961
02:35:33,811 --> 02:35:38,990
'Why have you brought me here again, if you
don't want to see me?

1962
02:35:38,990 --> 02:35:42,290
My father's very ill and I should be with
him.'

1963
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:44,400
Tears rolled down Linton's face.

1964
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:45,660
He seemed terrified.

1965
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:47,990
'Oh, I can't bear it!' he sobbed.

1966
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:48,990
Cathy, I daren't explain!

1967
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:54,870
But if you leave me, he'll kill me!

1968
02:35:54,870 --> 02:36:02,910
Dear Cathy, my life is in your hands!

1969
02:36:02,910 --> 02:36:15,980
Kind, sweet Cathy, perhaps you will agree,
and then he won't hurt me!'

1970
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:19,050
Cathy was no longer impatient.

1971
02:36:19,050 --> 02:36:22,771
'Agree to what, Linton?'

1972
02:36:22,771 --> 02:36:23,771
she asked gently.

1973
02:36:23,771 --> 02:36:24,940
'Tell me everything!

1974
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:31,900
You wouldn't do anything to hurt me, would
you, Linton?

1975
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:34,830
I'm your best friend.'

1976
02:36:34,830 --> 02:36:37,761
'I daren't tell you!

1977
02:36:37,761 --> 02:36:41,421
My father-' the boy gasped.

1978
02:36:41,421 --> 02:36:44,720
Just then Heathcliff appeared.

1979
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:51,420
He did not look at Cathy and Linton, who continued
talking to each other, but he spoke quietly

1980
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:53,750
to me.

1981
02:36:53,750 --> 02:36:58,040
'Ellen, how is Edgar?

1982
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:00,910
Is he dying, as the villagers say?'

1983
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:06,550
'It's true, the master is dying,' I answered.

1984
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:11,320
'That boy over there is dying too.

1985
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:15,700
I only hope Edgar dies before him.

1986
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:20,221
If Linton dies first, my plan will fail.'

1987
02:37:20,221 --> 02:37:30,620
He shouted angrily to his son, Get up, Linton!'
and then said politely to Cathy, 'Miss Cathy,

1988
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:33,290
would you help him back to the house.

1989
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:36,500
He can't walk far alone.'

1990
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:43,210
'Father has forbidden me to enter your house,'
said Cathy.

1991
02:37:43,210 --> 02:37:45,710
'Well, come along, Linton.

1992
02:37:45,710 --> 02:37:49,820
I'll have to take you home then,' said Heathcliff.

1993
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,820
'No!

1994
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:51,820
No!

1995
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,820
No!

1996
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:53,820
Please, Cathy!

1997
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:56,331
You must come with me!'

1998
02:37:56,331 --> 02:37:58,210
screamed Linton wildly.

1999
02:37:58,210 --> 02:38:01,451
He held desperately on to her arm.

2000
02:38:01,451 --> 02:38:07,980
Cathy could not refuse the boy, who seemed
almost mad with fear.

2001
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:12,690
So we all walked the few steps to Wuthering
Heights.

2002
02:38:12,690 --> 02:38:20,070
When we had entered the house, however, I
was horrified to see Heathcliff lock the front

2003
02:38:20,070 --> 02:38:21,070
door.

2004
02:38:21,070 --> 02:38:25,650
The key was in his hand.

2005
02:38:25,650 --> 02:38:35,080
'Hareton, Joseph and Zillah are all out of
the house,' he said calmly, so we are quite

2006
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:36,080
alone.'

2007
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:38,851
'Give me that key!'

2008
02:38:38,851 --> 02:38:41,110
cried Cathy angrily.

2009
02:38:41,110 --> 02:38:44,870
'I'm not afraid of you!'

2010
02:38:44,870 --> 02:38:48,601
She took hold of his closed hand and bit it.

2011
02:38:48,601 --> 02:38:57,471
He hit her violently several times, on both
sides of the head, and she fell into a chair,

2012
02:38:57,471 --> 02:38:58,471
trembling.

2013
02:38:58,471 --> 02:39:01,300
I rushed at him, but he pushed me away.

2014
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:07,141
'Cry as much as you like, Miss Cathy,' he
said.

2015
02:39:07,141 --> 02:39:18,040
'In a few days I'll be your father, and I'll
punish you just like that, as often as necessary!'

2016
02:39:18,040 --> 02:39:26,141
When Heathcliff went out to look for our horses,
Cathy and I hurried round the kitchen looking

2017
02:39:26,141 --> 02:39:27,570
for a way to escape.

2018
02:39:27,570 --> 02:39:31,721
But all the doors and windows were locked.

2019
02:39:31,721 --> 02:39:38,690
Linton was sitting calmly in a chair near
the fire, happy that he was not being punished

2020
02:39:38,690 --> 02:39:39,761
this time.

2021
02:39:39,761 --> 02:39:46,780
We persuaded him to explain his father's plan
to us.

2022
02:39:46,780 --> 02:39:54,980
'Father is afraid I'll die soon, you see,
so he wants us to be married tomorrow morning.

2023
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:59,136
You'll have to stay here all night, Cathy.

2024
02:39:59,136 --> 02:40:00,750
Then perhaps he'll let you go home in the
morning.'

2025
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:04,530
'You marry this beautiful, healthy young lady?'

2026
02:40:04,530 --> 02:40:05,800
I cried.

2027
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:08,701
You must be mad!

2028
02:40:08,701 --> 02:40:10,870
And wicked too!

2029
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:15,891
You and your father have tricked us into coming
here!'

2030
02:40:15,891 --> 02:40:20,450
And I shook him until he started coughing.

2031
02:40:20,450 --> 02:40:24,620
'I must go home now.

2032
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:30,470
Father will be worried already,' said Cathy.

2033
02:40:30,470 --> 02:40:34,460
I love Father better than you, Linton!'

2034
02:40:34,460 --> 02:40:38,561
Heathcliff returned and sent his son upstairs
to bed.

2035
02:40:38,561 --> 02:40:47,301
'Mr Heathcliff,' begged Cathy, 'Father will
be miserable if I don't go home.

2036
02:40:47,301 --> 02:40:50,421
Please let me go.

2037
02:40:50,421 --> 02:40:52,160
I promise to marry Linton.

2038
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:55,650
Father would like it, and I love him.

2039
02:40:55,650 --> 02:41:01,110
Why do you force me to do something I want
to do?'

2040
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:04,381
'He can't force you!'

2041
02:41:04,381 --> 02:41:06,011
I cried.

2042
02:41:06,011 --> 02:41:08,101
'I'll go to the police!'

2043
02:41:08,101 --> 02:41:10,510
'To the devil with you, Ellen!

2044
02:41:10,510 --> 02:41:15,410
Miss Cathy, I'm delighted that your father
will be miserable.

2045
02:41:15,410 --> 02:41:21,170
In that case you will certainly stay here
for twenty-four hours.

2046
02:41:21,170 --> 02:41:26,280
You won't leave here until you've kept your
promise to marry Linton.'

2047
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:31,990
'Please send Ellen to let Father know I'm
safe!'

2048
02:41:31,990 --> 02:41:33,670
sobbed Cathy bitterly.

2049
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:35,490
'Poor Father!

2050
02:41:35,490 --> 02:41:39,130
He'll think we're lost!'

2051
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:46,620
'Your father must have hated you when you
came into the world (I did, at least), and

2052
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:49,400
he'll hate you as he leaves it.

2053
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:51,500
Go on crying.

2054
02:41:51,500 --> 02:41:55,620
That's what you'll be doing when you're Linton's
wife.

2055
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:59,370
He'll make a cruel, selfish husband, I think.'

2056
02:41:59,370 --> 02:42:07,630
Heathcliff took us upstairs to Zillah's room,
where we spent the night, locked in.

2057
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:09,840
Neither of us could sleep.

2058
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:16,950
At seven the following morning he came to
fetch Cathy, and took her away.

2059
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:26,090
From that moment I saw nobody except Hareton,
who brought me food, for four whole days and

2060
02:42:26,090 --> 02:42:27,150
nights.

2061
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:31,790
On the fifth morning Zillah came into the
room.

2062
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:38,460
She was surprised and pleased to see me, and
told me the villagers all thought Cathy and

2063
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:43,190
I had got lost on the moors, and died, four
days ago.

2064
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:47,910
I ran out of the room to look for Cathy.

2065
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:56,440
The big kitchen was full of sunshine, and
the door was open, but the only person there

2066
02:42:56,440 --> 02:42:58,160
was Linton.

2067
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:00,740
'Where is she?

2068
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:04,190
Where is Miss Cathy?'

2069
02:43:04,190 --> 02:43:05,190
I cried wildly.

2070
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:10,710
'Upstairs, in a locked room,' he replied calmly,
eating a piece of sugar.

2071
02:43:10,710 --> 02:43:13,660
'We won't let her go yet.

2072
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:16,711
Father says I shouldn't be soft with Cathy.

2073
02:43:16,711 --> 02:43:23,460
We've had the wedding ceremony, so she's my
wife now, and must stay with me.

2074
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:27,730
I don't care if she cries, or is ill!'

2075
02:43:27,730 --> 02:43:35,380
'Have you forgotten her kindness to you last
winter, when you wrote that you loved her,

2076
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:38,491
and she used to come through wind and snow
to see you?

2077
02:43:38,491 --> 02:43:46,360
Now you believe your father's lies about her!

2078
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:49,280
And you leave her alone, ill and crying in
a strange house!

2079
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:53,081
You pity yourself, but you won't pity her!

2080
02:43:53,081 --> 02:43:57,900
What a heartless, selfish boy you are!'

2081
02:43:57,900 --> 02:44:00,670
'I can't stay with her!

2082
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:05,020
She cries so much I can't bear it!

2083
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:07,461
I can't sleep with all that noise.

2084
02:44:07,461 --> 02:44:16,300
She promised that if I gave her the key to
our room, she'd give me all her nice books,

2085
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:21,080
and her pony, but I told her she had nothing
to give.

2086
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:23,280
They're all mine, or they'll belong to me
very soon.

2087
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:30,820
And then she cried, and took a little gold
case from around her neck.

2088
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:36,590
Inside were two pictures, one of her mother
and one of her father.

2089
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:43,620
I wanted to take them both from her, but she
wouldn't let me, so I screamed for help.

2090
02:44:43,620 --> 02:44:50,370
My father came, and ordered her to give him
the pictures and the case.

2091
02:44:50,370 --> 02:44:59,271
When she refused, he - he hit her on the face
and knocked her down, and broke the gold case

2092
02:44:59,271 --> 02:45:01,171
under his foot.

2093
02:45:01,171 --> 02:45:04,200
He took away the picture of her mother.'

2094
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:09,670
'And were you pleased to see Miss Cathy hurt?'

2095
02:45:09,670 --> 02:45:10,920
I asked.

2096
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:14,340
'My father was right to punish her.

2097
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:18,040
But I didn't like seeing her mouth full of
blood.

2098
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:21,300
She can't speak because of the pain.

2099
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:24,760
Now you've made me tired with all this talking!

2100
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:27,641
You won't find the key to the room!

2101
02:45:27,641 --> 02:45:29,311
Go away!'

2102
02:45:29,311 --> 02:45:37,210
As there seemed to be no chance of persuading
him to help her escape, I decided to go back

2103
02:45:37,210 --> 02:45:43,711
to the Grange as quickly as possible, and
rescue her later.

2104
02:45:43,711 --> 02:45:50,171
What a welcome I received from the servants
at the Grange, who thought I was dead!

2105
02:45:50,171 --> 02:45:54,040
But I did not have time to tell them my story.

2106
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:57,780
I went straight to my master's room.

2107
02:45:57,780 --> 02:46:02,450
He was lying in bed, very weak and close to
death.

2108
02:46:02,450 --> 02:46:10,210
I told him how Heathcliff had trapped us,
and that Cathy was probably married to Linton

2109
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:11,900
by now.

2110
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:19,570
Mr Edgar realized that his enemy wanted to
get hold of the Linton fortune, through his

2111
02:46:19,570 --> 02:46:20,570
son.

2112
02:46:20,570 --> 02:46:26,830
He asked me to send for his lawyer, to make
arrangements so that Cathy would not lose

2113
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:28,570
all her inheritance.

2114
02:46:28,570 --> 02:46:35,940
I did as he asked, but the lawyer sent a message,
saying that he could not come until the next

2115
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:37,091
day.

2116
02:46:37,091 --> 02:46:45,780
I also sent four strong men with weapons to
Wuthering Heights, to demand my young lady's

2117
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:47,300
freedom.

2118
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:54,900
I was very angry when they returned without
her, because Heathcliff had sent them away.

2119
02:46:54,900 --> 02:46:56,511
But I needn't have worried.

2120
02:46:56,511 --> 02:47:03,580
In the middle of the night, as I was taking
some water to the master, I heard a knock

2121
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:07,320
on the front door, and went to open it.

2122
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:09,360
It was my little mistress!

2123
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:11,561
'Ellen, Ellen!'

2124
02:47:11,561 --> 02:47:13,760
she sobbed.

2125
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:18,170
'Is Father still alive?'

2126
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:23,141
'Yes,' I cried, 'and thank God you're safe
with us again!'

2127
02:47:23,141 --> 02:47:27,171
'I managed to make Linton help me escape from
the room!

2128
02:47:27,171 --> 02:47:30,910
Now I must see Father!'

2129
02:47:30,910 --> 02:47:35,840
'I could not bear to be present at their meeting.

2130
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:38,511
I waited outside the bedroom door.

2131
02:47:38,511 --> 02:47:41,260
But they were both calm.

2132
02:47:41,260 --> 02:47:47,431
Cathy's despair was as silent as her father's
happiness.

2133
02:47:47,431 --> 02:47:53,530
He died in perfect peace, Mr Lockwood.

2134
02:47:53,530 --> 02:48:05,591
Kissing her, he whispered, I'm going to join
her, and you, dear child, will join us!'

2135
02:48:05,591 --> 02:48:09,300
He did not move or speak again.

2136
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:17,230
Cathy did not cry, but sat silently by his
dead body all morning.

2137
02:48:17,230 --> 02:48:23,160
At lunch-time the lawyer arrived, too late
to help Cathy.

2138
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:27,681
Heathcliff had bribed him to stay away.

2139
02:48:27,681 --> 02:48:30,120
He gave us Heathcliffs orders.

2140
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:35,331
All the servants except me had to leave.

2141
02:48:35,331 --> 02:48:43,091
Cathy, Mrs Heathcliff now, was only allowed
to stay at the Grange until her father was

2142
02:48:43,091 --> 02:48:48,170
buried.

2143
02:48:48,170 --> 02:48:53,290
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Cathy becomes a widow

2144
02:48:53,290 --> 02:49:03,771
1800-1 On the evening after the burial, Heathcliff
came to fetch Cathy.

2145
02:49:03,771 --> 02:49:08,460
'Why not let her stay here with me?'

2146
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:10,720
I begged.

2147
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:16,750
'I'm looking for someone to rent the Grange
from me,' he answered.

2148
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:22,990
'You'll stay on here as housekeeper, Ellen,
but Cathy must come to Wuthering Heights.

2149
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:27,381
From now on she'll have to work for her food.'

2150
02:49:27,381 --> 02:49:30,551
'I shall work,' replied Cathy.

2151
02:49:30,551 --> 02:49:33,950
And I'll look after Linton.

2152
02:49:33,950 --> 02:49:37,110
He's all I've got to love in the world.

2153
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:39,950
I'm just sorry for you, Mr Heathcliff.

2154
02:49:39,950 --> 02:49:43,150
You have nobody to love you!

2155
02:49:43,150 --> 02:49:46,950
You are as lonely and miserable as the devil!

2156
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:51,880
Nobody will cry for you when you die!

2157
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:52,980
I'm glad I'm not you!'

2158
02:49:52,980 --> 02:49:58,920
'Go and get your clothes, you wicked girl,'
he said.

2159
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:02,811
'We'll be leaving in a few minutes.'

2160
02:50:02,811 --> 02:50:08,830
When she had gone, he walked across the room
to look at the picture of Cathy's mother,

2161
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:11,720
Catherine, which was hanging on the wall.

2162
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:20,330
'Do you know what I did yesterday, Ellen?'
he said, turning quickly away from the picture.

2163
02:50:20,330 --> 02:50:27,950
'I went to the churchyard, and asked the man
who was digging Edgar's grave to open the

2164
02:50:27,950 --> 02:50:32,251
lid of Catherine's coffin for me.

2165
02:50:32,251 --> 02:50:35,790
Her face looked just the same!

2166
02:50:35,790 --> 02:50:37,860
I could not stop looking at her.

2167
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:46,790
When the man closed the lid, I broke open
one side of her coffin, the side away from

2168
02:50:46,790 --> 02:50:50,110
Edgar's grave, and covered it up with earth.

2169
02:50:50,110 --> 02:50:59,290
And I bribed the man to bury me there when
I die, next to her, and to take the side of

2170
02:50:59,290 --> 02:51:07,330
my coffin away too, so that I shall have her
in my arms, not Edgar!'

2171
02:51:07,330 --> 02:51:15,771
'You were very wicked, Mr Heathcliff, to disturb
the dead!'

2172
02:51:15,771 --> 02:51:22,521
'I disturbed nobody, Ellen, and I feel much
happier now.

2173
02:51:22,521 --> 02:51:26,220
She is the one who has disturbed me.

2174
02:51:26,220 --> 02:51:30,040
For eighteen years she has haunted me.

2175
02:51:30,040 --> 02:51:35,110
You know I was wild, almost mad, after she
died.

2176
02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:40,260
For days I prayed for her ghost to return
to me.

2177
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:45,820
On the day of her burial, I went to her grave
in the evening.

2178
02:51:45,820 --> 02:51:49,540
There was a bitter wind, and snow on the ground.

2179
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:55,091
I wanted so much to have her in my arms again!

2180
02:51:55,091 --> 02:52:02,550
So I dug down through the loose earth to her
coffin, and was about to pull the lid off,

2181
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:07,500
when I felt a warm breath on my face.

2182
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:12,391
She seemed to be with me, not in the earth,
but close to me.

2183
02:52:12,391 --> 02:52:17,642
I was so happy that she was with me again!

2184
02:52:17,642 --> 02:52:25,480
I filled in the grave, and ran eagerly home
to the Heights.

2185
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:26,710
I looked impatiently round for her.

2186
02:52:26,710 --> 02:52:30,710
I could feel her but I could not see her!

2187
02:52:30,710 --> 02:52:36,881
And since then, she has played plenty of tricks
on me like that.

2188
02:52:36,881 --> 02:52:44,001
When I sleep in her bedroom, I can hear her
outside the window, or entering the room,

2189
02:52:44,001 --> 02:52:52,101
or even breathing close to me, but when I
open my eyes, I'm always disappointed.

2190
02:52:52,101 --> 02:53:01,750
Slowly, slowly, she's killing me, with the
ghost of a hope that's lasted eighteen years!'

2191
02:53:01,750 --> 02:53:07,920
He was talking almost to himself, so I did
not answer.

2192
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:12,591
When Cathy came in, he stood up, ready to
go.

2193
02:53:12,591 --> 02:53:14,220
'Goodbye, Ellen!'

2194
02:53:14,220 --> 02:53:18,301
whispered my dear little mistress.

2195
02:53:18,301 --> 02:53:20,710
'Come and visit me!'

2196
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:26,820
As she kissed me, her face felt as cold as
ice.

2197
02:53:26,820 --> 02:53:32,370
'Oh, no you won't, Ellen!' said Heathcliff.

2198
02:53:32,370 --> 02:53:38,501
I'll send for you if I want you!' and together
they left the Grange.

2199
02:53:38,501 --> 02:53:42,521
I haven't seen Cathy since then.

2200
02:53:42,521 --> 02:53:48,900
Once I went to the Heights to visit her, but
I was not allowed to see her.

2201
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:55,670
About six weeks ago I had a long conversation
with Zillah, the housekeeper, who gave me

2202
02:53:55,670 --> 02:53:57,210
news of Cathy.

2203
02:53:57,210 --> 02:54:04,601
It appeared that, when she arrived at the
Heights, she did her best to look after her

2204
02:54:04,601 --> 02:54:05,920
sick husband.

2205
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:12,131
He was obviously dying, although Heathcliff
refused to call the doctor.

2206
02:54:12,131 --> 02:54:18,851
Only a few weeks after her arrival, Linton
died in the night, with only Cathy by his

2207
02:54:18,851 --> 02:54:20,620
bedside.

2208
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:28,570
Heathcliff inherited all of Linton's, and
what had been Cathy's, fortune, so Cathy is

2209
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:30,500
now very poor.

2210
02:54:30,500 --> 02:54:38,540
She must be very miserable, and very lonely,
in that dark, unpleasant house.

2211
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:43,470
Heathcliff hates her, and Joseph and Zillah
don't speak to her, because they think she's

2212
02:54:43,470 --> 02:54:44,601
too proud.

2213
02:54:44,601 --> 02:54:52,840
Poor Hareton would like to be friendly with
her, but she scorns him because he's uneducated.

2214
02:54:52,840 --> 02:54:59,311
I would like to leave my job here, rent a
little cottage and ask Cathy to come and live

2215
02:54:59,311 --> 02:55:04,510
with me, but Mr Heathcliff will never permit
that.

2216
02:55:04,510 --> 02:55:14,771
Of course, if she married again, she could
leave that house, but I can't arrange that.

2217
02:55:14,771 --> 02:55:22,000
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Mr Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights again

2218
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:34,391
1802 After hearing the end of Mrs Dean's story,
I made my plans for the future.

2219
02:55:34,391 --> 02:55:39,261
I decided I did not want to spend another
winter at the Grange, and told her I would

2220
02:55:39,261 --> 02:55:44,120
ride to the Heights to inform my landlord.

2221
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:50,061
She handed me a letter to give to Cathy Heathcliff.

2222
02:55:50,061 --> 02:55:55,400
When I arrived at the gate, Hareton met me
and took me into the house.

2223
02:55:55,400 --> 02:56:00,971
Cathy was there, preparing vegetables for
lunch.

2224
02:56:00,971 --> 02:56:03,541
She did not bother to greet me.

2225
02:56:03,541 --> 02:56:09,301
'She may be beautiful,' I thought, 'but she's
not very polite.'

2226
02:56:09,301 --> 02:56:18,110
I passed by her chair, and cleverly dropped
Mrs Dean's note in front of her, so that Hareton

2227
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:19,780
wouldn't see it.

2228
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:25,050
She, however, just said aloud, 'What's that?'

2229
02:56:25,050 --> 02:56:32,210
'A letter from the housekeeper at the Grange,'
I said, annoyed with her.

2230
02:56:32,210 --> 02:56:38,381
She gasped, and tried to pick it up, but Hareton
got there first.

2231
02:56:38,381 --> 02:56:45,391
'Mr Heathcliff will want to look at this,'
he said, putting it in his pocket.

2232
02:56:45,391 --> 02:56:52,670
But when Cathy pretended to cry, Hareton could
not bear to make her sad, and he threw the

2233
02:56:52,670 --> 02:56:56,011
letter down on the table.

2234
02:56:56,011 --> 02:57:01,830
She eagerly read every word, and asked me
several questions about the people at the

2235
02:57:01,830 --> 02:57:03,090
Grange.

2236
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:10,010
'Mrs Dean will want an answer to her letter,'
I reminded her.

2237
02:57:10,010 --> 02:57:16,820
'You must tell her that I have no paper or
pens to write with.

2238
02:57:16,820 --> 02:57:20,990
I haven't even any books!'

2239
02:57:20,990 --> 02:57:22,660
she answered sadly.

2240
02:57:22,660 --> 02:57:24,181
'No books!'

2241
02:57:24,181 --> 02:57:25,700
I cried.

2242
02:57:25,700 --> 02:57:31,311
'How can you manage without them in this lonely
place?'

2243
02:57:31,311 --> 02:57:39,761
'I always used to read so much that Mr Heathcliff
decided to take away my only pleasure and

2244
02:57:39,761 --> 02:57:43,061
destroy my books.

2245
02:57:43,061 --> 02:57:46,271
I've looked all over the house for them.

2246
02:57:46,271 --> 02:57:54,181
Joseph only reads the Bible, but some of my
books are in Hareton's room!

2247
02:57:54,181 --> 02:57:56,391
Why did you take them, Hareton?

2248
02:57:56,391 --> 02:57:59,851
Just because you enjoy stealing?

2249
02:57:59,851 --> 02:58:03,931
They can't be any use to you!'

2250
02:58:03,931 --> 02:58:12,120
'I think Mr Hareton wants to learn,' I said,
hoping to prevent a quarrel between them.

2251
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:16,670
'No doubt he took them away to study them.'

2252
02:58:16,670 --> 02:58:20,220
'Yes,' replied Cathy, laughing.

2253
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:27,070
'I hear him trying to read to himself sometimes
and it's extremely funny!

2254
02:58:27,070 --> 02:58:33,051
He makes some terrible mistakes!'

2255
02:58:33,051 --> 02:58:37,340
After a moment's shocked silence Hareton left
the room.

2256
02:58:37,340 --> 02:58:44,141
He returned almost immediately with his arms
full of books, and threw them angrily down

2257
02:58:44,141 --> 02:58:45,580
at Cathy's feet.

2258
02:58:45,580 --> 02:58:48,950
'Take them!' he shouted.

2259
02:58:48,950 --> 02:58:53,050
'I never want to see them again!'

2260
02:58:53,050 --> 02:58:58,080
'I won't have them now,' she said.

2261
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:03,510
'I'll hate them because they'll make me think
of you.'

2262
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:12,090
Hareton picked up the books and threw them
on the fire, then walked quickly out of the

2263
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:13,090
house.

2264
02:59:13,090 --> 02:59:18,610
Mr Heathcliff came in as Hareton went out.

2265
02:59:18,610 --> 02:59:23,590
He had a restless, anxious expression on his
face.

2266
02:59:23,590 --> 02:59:32,021
'Mr Heathcliff,' I said, 'I must tell you
I'm leaving for London next week, for six

2267
02:59:32,021 --> 02:59:36,970
months, and I shan't want to rent the Grange
any more after October.'

2268
02:59:36,970 --> 02:59:45,771
'So, Mr Lockwood, you've got tired of the
moors already, have you?

2269
02:59:45,771 --> 02:59:52,190
Well, have your lunch with Hareton and me,
anyway.

2270
02:59:52,190 --> 02:59:58,530
Cathy, take your lunch in the kitchen with
Joseph and Zillah.'

2271
02:59:58,530 --> 03:00:07,290
I did not enjoy lunch with my two silent companions,
and left the Heights straight afterwards.

2272
03:00:07,290 --> 03:00:16,341
'What a pity,' I thought, 'that Cathy Heathcliff
and I didn't fall in love, as Mrs Dean would

2273
03:00:16,341 --> 03:00:17,570
have liked!

2274
03:00:17,570 --> 03:00:24,840
Then I could have taken her away from this
miserable place forever!'

2275
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:31,530
Several months later, in September, I was
travelling to visit friends in Yorkshire.

2276
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:37,131
I found myself near Thrushcross Grange, and
decided to spend a night there.

2277
03:00:37,131 --> 03:00:42,050
After all, I was still paying rent for it.

2278
03:00:42,050 --> 03:00:49,312
When I arrived, I was surprised to find a
different housekeeper, who told me Mrs Dean

2279
03:00:49,312 --> 03:00:52,791
had become housekeeper at the Heights.

2280
03:00:52,791 --> 03:00:59,420
I wanted to have a walk after travelling all
day, so I left orders for the woman to cook

2281
03:00:59,420 --> 03:01:07,710
my supper and prepare a bedroom for me, and
I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights.

2282
03:01:07,710 --> 03:01:15,141
As I came close to the old house, I noticed
that there were flowers in the garden, and

2283
03:01:15,141 --> 03:01:18,470
the doors and windows stood open.

2284
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:26,090
I could see two people inside, and I stopped
for a moment, curious to hear a little of

2285
03:01:26,090 --> 03:01:27,260
their conversation.

2286
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:34,860
'Read it again, stupid!' said a voice as sweet
as a silver bell.

2287
03:01:34,860 --> 03:01:40,141
'Read it correctly this time, or I'll pull
your hair!'

2288
03:01:40,141 --> 03:01:43,931
'You must kiss me if I get it right,' answered
a deep voice.

2289
03:01:43,931 --> 03:01:50,450
The man was sitting at a table, reading from
a book.

2290
03:01:50,450 --> 03:01:57,710
His handsome face shone with pleasure, and
his eyes often left the book to look at the

2291
03:01:57,710 --> 03:02:01,550
small white hand that lay on his shoulder.

2292
03:02:01,550 --> 03:02:07,460
The girl stood behind him, bending over to
help him.

2293
03:02:07,460 --> 03:02:15,220
Her face - it was fortunate he could not see
her face, or he would never have been able

2294
03:02:15,220 --> 03:02:18,580
to concentrate on his studies.

2295
03:02:18,580 --> 03:02:25,510
I could see it, and I was bitterly sorry that
I had thrown away my chance of seeing that

2296
03:02:25,510 --> 03:02:29,141
beauty every day of my life.

2297
03:02:29,141 --> 03:02:36,851
I did not want to disturb their happiness,
so I went round to the back door, where I

2298
03:02:36,851 --> 03:02:40,870
discovered my old friend Ellen Dean.

2299
03:02:40,870 --> 03:02:46,891
'Oh, Mr Lockwood, welcome back!' she cried.

2300
03:02:46,891 --> 03:02:50,931
'Are you staying at the Grange again?'

2301
03:02:50,931 --> 03:02:55,320
'Yes, Mrs Dean, just for one night.

2302
03:02:55,320 --> 03:03:02,021
But tell me, why are you housekeeper here
now and not at the Grange?'

2303
03:03:02,021 --> 03:03:09,261
'Zillah left, you see, and Mr Heathcliff wanted
me here.'

2304
03:03:09,261 --> 03:03:15,460
'I have a little business with him, about
the rent.'

2305
03:03:15,460 --> 03:03:17,220
'Oh!

2306
03:03:17,220 --> 03:03:19,881
Mr Heathcliff is dead, sir.

2307
03:03:19,881 --> 03:03:23,131
He died three months ago.

2308
03:03:23,131 --> 03:03:28,641
I manage all Mrs Heathcliffs business for
her.

2309
03:03:28,641 --> 03:03:33,780
She hasn't learnt to do it herself yet, you
see.'

2310
03:03:33,780 --> 03:03:37,110
'Heathcliff is dead!'

2311
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:40,440
I repeated, surprised.

2312
03:03:40,440 --> 03:03:41,551
'Well!

2313
03:03:41,551 --> 03:03:44,271
Tell me how it happened, Mrs Dean!'

2314
03:03:44,271 --> 03:03:50,700
'Sit down, sir, and drink some beer.

2315
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:53,030
I'll gladly tell you.

2316
03:03:53,030 --> 03:04:01,750
His life ended very strangely.'

2317
03:04:01,750 --> 03:04:04,791
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Heathcliffs end

2318
03:04:04,791 --> 03:04:17,160
1801-2 I was delighted to come back to the
Heights, and hoped I could make Cathy's life

2319
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:18,460
more comfortable.

2320
03:04:18,460 --> 03:04:23,910
But she was restless, and complained of loneliness.

2321
03:04:23,910 --> 03:04:31,681
At first she continued to annoy Hareton, by
laughing at him, but after a while she decided

2322
03:04:31,681 --> 03:04:34,750
she really wanted him as a friend.

2323
03:04:34,750 --> 03:04:42,061
She apologized for being rude to him, and
offered to teach him everything she knew.

2324
03:04:42,061 --> 03:04:50,021
From that moment on, the two cousins have
always been together, studying.

2325
03:04:50,021 --> 03:04:56,290
Hareton has a lot to learn, and Cathy is not
the most patient of teachers.

2326
03:04:56,290 --> 03:05:00,720
But what they have in common is their love
for each other.

2327
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:05,811
You see, Mr Lockwood, it was easy enough to
win Cathy's heart.

2328
03:05:05,811 --> 03:05:09,080
But now I'm glad you didn't try.

2329
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:14,141
I'll be the happiest woman in England when
those two marry!

2330
03:05:14,141 --> 03:05:21,280
Heathcliff noticed little of what was happening
around him, and would never have been aware

2331
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:25,260
of the cousins' feelings, if it hadn't been
for Joseph.

2332
03:05:25,260 --> 03:05:32,811
In the middle of our lunch one day, the old
man rushed into the room, shaking with anger.

2333
03:05:32,811 --> 03:05:34,790
'I'll have to leave!

2334
03:05:34,790 --> 03:05:42,970
I wanted to die here, where I've been a servant
for sixty years!

2335
03:05:42,970 --> 03:05:47,130
But now she's taken my garden from me!

2336
03:05:47,130 --> 03:05:50,250
She's stolen the boy's soul, master!

2337
03:05:50,250 --> 03:05:51,790
I can't bear it!'

2338
03:05:51,790 --> 03:05:58,291
'Is the fool drunk?' asked Heathcliff.

2339
03:05:58,291 --> 03:06:00,950
Can you explain this, Hareton?'

2340
03:06:00,950 --> 03:06:09,471
'I've pulled up two or three of his fruit-trees,'
confessed Hareton, but I'll put them back

2341
03:06:09,471 --> 03:06:10,471
again.'

2342
03:06:10,471 --> 03:06:14,070
'It was my fault,' added Cathy bravely.

2343
03:06:14,070 --> 03:06:16,200
I asked him to do it.

2344
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:19,300
We wanted to plant some flowers there.'

2345
03:06:19,300 --> 03:06:23,730
'Who the devil gave you permission?'

2346
03:06:23,730 --> 03:06:24,730
growled Heathcliff.

2347
03:06:24,730 --> 03:06:31,761
'You should let me have a bit of garden, as
you've taken all my land!' replied Cathy sharply.

2348
03:06:31,761 --> 03:06:34,811
And you've taken Hareton's land too!

2349
03:06:34,811 --> 03:06:37,790
He and I are friends now!

2350
03:06:37,790 --> 03:06:40,710
I'll tell him about you!'

2351
03:06:40,710 --> 03:06:44,200
The master stood up, staring at her fiercely.

2352
03:06:44,200 --> 03:06:49,480
'Out of the room, wicked girl!' he shouted.

2353
03:06:49,480 --> 03:06:54,660
I'll kill you if I get near you!'

2354
03:06:54,660 --> 03:06:56,921
'If you hit me, Hareton will hit you.

2355
03:06:56,921 --> 03:07:03,330
He won't obey you anymore, and soon he'll
hate you as much as I do!'

2356
03:07:03,330 --> 03:07:06,440
'You'd better leave, Cathy,' whispered Hareton
urgently.

2357
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:08,980
'I won't quarrel with Mr Heathcliff.'

2358
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:12,540
But it was too late.

2359
03:07:12,540 --> 03:07:15,740
I was sure Heathcliff was going to hit her.

2360
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:22,931
He took hold of her, one strong hand in her
hair and the other raised over her head.

2361
03:07:22,931 --> 03:07:30,950
But when he looked into her face, his anger
suddenly disappeared, and he let his arm fall

2362
03:07:30,950 --> 03:07:33,130
to his side.

2363
03:07:33,130 --> 03:07:38,820
He sat heavily down in his chair and put his
hand over his eyes for a moment.

2364
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:43,670
We all stared at him.

2365
03:07:43,670 --> 03:07:51,301
You must learn not to make me angry,' he said,
trying to be calm.

2366
03:07:51,301 --> 03:07:53,740
Go away, all of you!

2367
03:07:53,740 --> 03:07:56,091
Leave me alone!'

2368
03:07:56,091 --> 03:08:03,351
A little later he went out, saying he would
return in the evening.

2369
03:08:03,351 --> 03:08:10,320
As darkness fell, Cathy and Hareton were busy
at their studies in the kitchen.

2370
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:15,580
I was sitting with them, happy to see them
helping each other so well.

2371
03:08:15,580 --> 03:08:21,351
I feel they're almost my children, Mr Lockwood,
and I'm very proud of them.

2372
03:08:21,351 --> 03:08:27,440
As the master entered the house, he had a
full view of us three.

2373
03:08:27,440 --> 03:08:29,790
They lifted their eyes to meet his.

2374
03:08:29,790 --> 03:08:37,101
Perhaps you haven't noticed it, but their
eyes are very similar, and they are exactly

2375
03:08:37,101 --> 03:08:40,000
like those of Catherine Earnshaw.

2376
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:44,990
Mr Heathcliff stopped and stared, then looked
away.

2377
03:08:44,990 --> 03:08:52,910
At a sign from me, Cathy and Hareton went
quietly out into the garden, leaving me alone

2378
03:08:52,910 --> 03:08:55,211
with Mr Heathcliff.

2379
03:08:55,211 --> 03:09:04,811
'It's silly, isn't it, Ellen,' he muttered,
'that I have worked all my life to destroy

2380
03:09:04,811 --> 03:09:09,271
these two families, the Earnshaws and the
Lintons.

2381
03:09:09,271 --> 03:09:13,581
I've got their money and their land.

2382
03:09:13,581 --> 03:09:21,101
Now I can take my final revenge on the last
Earnshaw and the last Linton, I no longer

2383
03:09:21,101 --> 03:09:22,690
want to!

2384
03:09:22,690 --> 03:09:26,970
There's a strange change coming in my life.

2385
03:09:26,970 --> 03:09:28,300
I'm in its shadow.

2386
03:09:28,300 --> 03:09:34,730
I'm so little interested in daily events that
I even forget to eat and drink.

2387
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:41,660
I don't want to see those two, that's why
I don't care if they spend time together.

2388
03:09:41,660 --> 03:09:43,391
She only makes me angry.

2389
03:09:43,391 --> 03:09:47,050
And he looks so like Catherine!

2390
03:09:47,050 --> 03:09:51,021
But everything reminds me of Catherine!

2391
03:09:51,021 --> 03:09:56,210
In every cloud, in every tree I see her face!

2392
03:09:56,210 --> 03:10:02,290
The whole world reminds me that she was here
once, and I have lost her!'

2393
03:10:02,290 --> 03:10:06,650
'You don't feel ill, sir, do you?

2394
03:10:06,650 --> 03:10:09,760
Are you afraid of death?'

2395
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:13,750
I'm not ill, Ellen, and I'm not afraid to
die.

2396
03:10:13,750 --> 03:10:16,851
But I can't continue like this!

2397
03:10:16,851 --> 03:10:23,590
I have to remind myself to breathe - almost
to remind my heart to beat!

2398
03:10:23,590 --> 03:10:32,632
I have a single wish, for something my whole
body and heart and brain have wanted for so

2399
03:10:32,632 --> 03:10:33,632
long!

2400
03:10:33,632 --> 03:10:34,740
Oh God!

2401
03:10:34,740 --> 03:10:37,551
It's a long fight!

2402
03:10:37,551 --> 03:10:41,070
I wish it were finished!'

2403
03:10:41,070 --> 03:10:47,601
For some days after that, Mr Heathcliff avoided
meeting us at meals.

2404
03:10:47,601 --> 03:10:50,300
He ate less and less.

2405
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:54,650
Late one night I heard him leave the house.

2406
03:10:54,650 --> 03:10:57,030
He did not return until the morning.

2407
03:10:57,030 --> 03:11:02,101
When he came in, I noticed a change in his
expression.

2408
03:11:02,101 --> 03:11:09,141
There was a strange, wild happiness in his
face, although he was pale and trembling.

2409
03:11:09,141 --> 03:11:12,380
'Will you have some breakfast, sir?'

2410
03:11:12,380 --> 03:11:13,380
I asked.

2411
03:11:13,380 --> 03:11:16,880
'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered.

2412
03:11:16,880 --> 03:11:21,460
'I don't think you should stay outside at
night, sir.

2413
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:25,370
You'll catch a bad cold or a fever!'

2414
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:29,360
'Leave me alone, Ellen,' he replied.

2415
03:11:29,360 --> 03:11:32,400
I began to worry about him.

2416
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:39,080
He was strong and healthy, but a man must
eat in order to live.

2417
03:11:39,080 --> 03:11:42,910
For the next three days he ate nothing.

2418
03:11:42,910 --> 03:11:48,681
At every meal the food lay untouched on the
plate in front of him.

2419
03:11:48,681 --> 03:11:52,200
He did not look at the food, or at us.

2420
03:11:52,200 --> 03:12:00,220
He seemed to be looking at something quite
close to him, something we could not see.

2421
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:07,101
His fierce black eyes followed it with such
eager interest that he sometimes stopped breathing

2422
03:12:07,101 --> 03:12:09,030
for as much as half a minute.

2423
03:12:09,030 --> 03:12:12,330
He did not sleep either.

2424
03:12:12,330 --> 03:12:21,130
For three days he had spent the night in Catherine
Earnshaw's old bedroom, and I could hear him

2425
03:12:21,130 --> 03:12:27,990
walking up and down, and talking, calling,
crying all night.

2426
03:12:27,990 --> 03:12:33,101
One morning I managed to speak to him, and
make him listen to me.

2427
03:12:33,101 --> 03:12:38,740
Mr Heathcliff, you must have some food and
sleep.

2428
03:12:38,740 --> 03:12:41,130
Look at yourself in the mirror!

2429
03:12:41,130 --> 03:12:43,690
You look ill and tired.'

2430
03:12:43,690 --> 03:12:49,160
'It's not my fault that I can't eat or rest.

2431
03:12:49,160 --> 03:12:53,851
You wouldn't tell a drowning man to rest when
he can see the shore!

2432
03:12:53,851 --> 03:13:00,470
I'm close to what I've wanted for eighteen
years, very close!

2433
03:13:00,470 --> 03:13:04,340
But my soul's happiness is killing my body!'

2434
03:13:04,340 --> 03:13:09,500
'It's a strange kind of happiness, master.

2435
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:15,370
Take my advice, and pray to God to forgive
you for what you've done wrong in the past,

2436
03:13:15,370 --> 03:13:18,320
if you think you're going to die.'

2437
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:23,351
'Thank you, Ellen, you've reminded me of something.

2438
03:13:23,351 --> 03:13:26,300
It's the way I want to be buried.

2439
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:31,450
My coffin will be carried to the churchyard
in the evening.

2440
03:13:31,450 --> 03:13:36,910
You and Hareton will be present, nobody else.

2441
03:13:36,910 --> 03:13:41,210
And make sure my orders about the two coffins
are obeyed!

2442
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:49,141
I want no ceremony, or words from the Bible
- I don't believe in any of that.'

2443
03:13:49,141 --> 03:13:55,480
He spent the next night, and the next day,
in Catherine's room, muttering and sobbing

2444
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:57,290
all the time.

2445
03:13:57,290 --> 03:14:03,700
I sent for Dr Kenneth, but the door was locked,
so the doctor could not see him.

2446
03:14:03,700 --> 03:14:11,380
The following night was very wet, and in the
morning as I walked in the garden, I noticed

2447
03:14:11,380 --> 03:14:13,660
that the bedroom window was wide open.

2448
03:14:13,660 --> 03:14:20,370
'He must be very wet if he's in bed,' I thought,
the bed is so close to the window.

2449
03:14:20,370 --> 03:14:23,530
I'll go and look.'

2450
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:29,681
I found another key which fitted the lock,
and opened the door.

2451
03:14:29,681 --> 03:14:33,601
Mr Heathcliff was there in bed, lying on his
back.

2452
03:14:33,601 --> 03:14:42,030
His eyes were staring at me, so eagerly and
fiercely, and he seemed to be smiling!

2453
03:14:42,030 --> 03:14:48,180
His face and clothes were wet from the rain,
and he did not move.

2454
03:14:48,180 --> 03:14:51,880
I realized he was dead!

2455
03:14:51,880 --> 03:14:55,280
I closed the window.

2456
03:14:55,280 --> 03:15:00,511
I combed his long, black hair from his forehead.

2457
03:15:00,511 --> 03:15:05,030
I tried to close his eyes, but they would
not shut.

2458
03:15:05,030 --> 03:15:09,240
Suddenly frightened, I called for Joseph.

2459
03:15:09,240 --> 03:15:15,921
The old servant came at once, but refused
to touch the body.

2460
03:15:15,921 --> 03:15:19,851
'Ah, the devil's taken his soul!

2461
03:15:19,851 --> 03:15:24,490
I warned him that would happen!' he cried.

2462
03:15:24,490 --> 03:15:30,450
'You see how wicked he is, smiling at death!

2463
03:15:30,450 --> 03:15:39,480
But thank God Hareton Earnshaw will have the
house and land now, that he should have inherited

2464
03:15:39,480 --> 03:15:41,040
from his father!'

2465
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:45,351
And he went down on his knees to pray.

2466
03:15:45,351 --> 03:15:51,510
Hareton was, in fact, the only one who was
sad at Heathcliffs death.

2467
03:15:51,510 --> 03:15:57,471
He and I were present at the burial.

2468
03:15:57,471 --> 03:16:02,670
Heathcliff was buried next to Catherine's
grave, as he had wished.

2469
03:16:02,670 --> 03:16:09,521
As we were not sure of his age or anything
else about him, there is only one word on

2470
03:16:09,521 --> 03:16:13,721
his gravestone - Heathcliff.

2471
03:16:13,721 --> 03:16:17,180
The villagers are very frightened of his ghost.

2472
03:16:17,180 --> 03:16:22,101
They say he often haunts the churchyard and
the moors.

2473
03:16:22,101 --> 03:16:29,820
Hareton and Cathy will be married on New Year's
Day, and they'll move to the Grange.

2474
03:16:29,820 --> 03:16:33,330
I'll be their housekeeper.

2475
03:16:33,330 --> 03:16:39,130
Joseph will take care of Wuthering Heights,
but most of the rooms here won't be used again.

2476
03:16:39,130 --> 03:16:46,181
You'll pass the churchyard, Mr Lockwood, on
your way back to the Grange, and you'll see

2477
03:16:46,181 --> 03:16:50,120
the three gravestones close to the moor.

2478
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:56,771
Catherine's, the middle one, is old now, and
half buried in plants which have grown over

2479
03:16:56,771 --> 03:16:58,181
it.

2480
03:16:58,181 --> 03:17:03,891
On one side is Edgar Linton's, and on the
other is Heathcliffs new one.

2481
03:17:03,891 --> 03:17:11,761
If you stay there a moment, and watch the
insects flying in the warm summer air, and

2482
03:17:11,761 --> 03:17:19,101
listen to the soft wind breathing through
the grass, you'll understand how quietly they

2483
03:17:19,101 --> 03:17:22,681
rest, the sleepers in that quiet earth.

2484
03:17:22,681 --> 03:17:23,260
- THE END -
