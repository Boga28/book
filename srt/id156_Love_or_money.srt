CHAPTER ONE
 
 

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,640
The Clarkson family lived in the country  

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:15,920
near Cambridge, about half a mile from the 
nearest village and about a mile from the river.  

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,800
They had a big, old house with a beautiful 
garden, a lot of flowers and many old trees.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,720
One Thursday morning in July, 
Jackie came in from the garden.  

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,560
She was a tall, fat woman, thirty years 
old. It was the hottest day of the year,  

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
but she wore a warm brown skirt and yellow shirt.  

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,600
She went into the kitchen to get a drink 
of water. Just then the phone rang.  

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
'Cambridge 1379,' Jackie said.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,200
'Hello. This is Diane. I want to talk to Mother.'  

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,200
'Mother isn't here,' Jackie said. 'She's 
at the doctor's.' 'Why? What's wrong?'

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:33,280
'Nothing's wrong,' Jackie said. 'Why are you 
telephoning? You are going to come this weekend?  

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
Mother wants everyone to be here.'

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:47,440
'Yes, I want to come,' Diane said. 'I'm phoning 
because I have no money for the train ticket.'

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,840
'No money! Mother is always giving you money!'

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:08,000
'This phone call is very expensive,' Diane said 
coldly. 'Tell Mother please. I need the money.'

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Jackie put the phone down. She took a 
cigarette from her bag and began to smoke.  

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,560
She felt angry because her sister always 
asked for money. Diane was twenty years old,  

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,240
the youngest in the family. She 
lived in London, in one room  

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:42,160
of a big house. She wanted to be a singer. She 
sang very well but she could never get work.

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,840
Jackie went back into the kitchen 
and began to make some sandwiches.  

22
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,160
Just then the back door 
opened, and her mother came in.

23
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,880
'It's very hot!' Molly said. She took 
off her hat and put it down on the table.  

24
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,960
She was a tall, dark woman with beautiful eyes.

25
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,320
Two big, black dogs came into the 
kitchen after her and ran across to her.  

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,600
She sat down and put her hands on their heads.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
Jackie put the sandwiches on the table.  

28
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,920
'Mother,' she said, 'Diane phoned. 
She wants money for her train ticket.'

29
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,720
Molly closed her eyes for a 
minute. Then she stood up.  

30
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,280
'This afternoon I want you to get the 
house ready for the weekend,' she said.  

31
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,840
'Oh, and please go to the village 
later and get my tablets.'

32
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,760
'Yes, Mother,' Jackie said.

33
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
Molly went to the door.

34
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
'Mother, please wait a minute,'  

35
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:25,120
Jackie said. 'Peter Hobbs came here this morning. 
He's very angry with you about that letter.  

36
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:36,560
He lost his job, you know. Why did you write to 
his office? He wants to talk to you about it.'

37
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,480
'Well, I don't want to talk to him,' 
Molly said. She opened the door.

38
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:57,680
'But Mother, you don't understand. He's seventeen, 
and it was his first job. He's very, very angry.  

39
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
He says ... he says he's going to kill you!'

40
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:23,840
Molly did not answer. She went out 
of the room and closed the door.
 
 
 

41
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
CHAPTER TWO
 

42
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,800
It was seven o'clock on Saturday 
evening. Jackie stood at the window.  

43
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:46,240
A car drove slowly up to the front door and 
stopped. A tall man with white hair got out.  

44
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:59,040
It was Albert, the husband of Molly's sister. 
'Here's Uncle Albert,' Jackie said. 'Always late.'  

45
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:10,320
She went out of the room and opened the front 
door. Albert came in and went at once to Molly.

46
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:22,960
'Oh, dear. I'm very late. I am sorry,' 
Albert said. 'Fifty years old today!  

47
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,640
What a wonderful dress!'

48
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,680
Molly did not smile. 'Thank you, 
Albert. We're all getting older.'  

49
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,040
Tonight she wore a long black dress, 
and the two black dogs sat at her feet.  

50
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,120
'Everyone is here now. Let's 
go in to dinner,' she said.

51
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Everyone stood up and went to the table.  

52
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,680
'The table looks nice, Jackie. What 
wonderful flowers!' Diane said.  

53
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:19,600
She was a beautiful girl, with long black hair 
and dark blue eyes. She wore a long red dress.

54
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,840
Albert sat down next to Roger. Roger 
was Molly's son, her second child.  

55
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,840
He lived in Cambridge, in an expensive house.

56
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,840
'Someone called Peter stopped 
me down the road,' Albert said.  

57
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,200
'Who is he? He's very angry with you, Molly.'

58
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:00,000
'That's Peter Hobbs, from the house across 
the road,' Jackie said quickly. She looked  

59
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,760
across the table at Molly. 'He lost his job 
last week and he's angry with everyone.'

60
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
'It's Molly he doesn't like,' Albert said.

61
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,880
Molly said nothing. Everyone began to eat.

62
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,320
'How is Aunt Annie?' Jackie asked.

63
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,480
'She's much worse now,' Albert said. 
'She stays in bed all the time.  

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,920
She needs a nurse twenty-four hours a day.'

65
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,240
'I am sorry,' Molly said.

66
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:53,840
Albert stopped eating and looked at Molly. 'It's 
very difficult and very expensive, you know.  

67
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,640
Annie feels very unhappy because you don't 
visit her, Molly. She loves you very much.  

68
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,840
You are her little sister, you know.'

69
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,520
Molly closed her eyes for a 
minute. 'I know that, Albert.  

70
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:25,760
I am fifty years old, but I am always her "little" 
sister. Well, we can talk about it later.'

71
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,720
Albert laughed. 'Oh yes,  

72
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:41,280
we can talk later. It's always later with 
you, Molly. Always tomorrow. Never today.'

73
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Jackie watched her mother. Her mother 
was angry with Albert. Molly never liked  

74
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,800
talking about her sister Annie and she did not 
like visiting her because she was very ill.

75
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,960
'That's a beautiful dress, 
Diane. Is it new?' Jackie asked.

76
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
'Thank you, Jackie. Yes, it's new,  

77
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,160
and very expensive. I got it on Wednesday,' 
Diane said. She smiled at Jackie.

78
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,800
'All your things are expensive,' Jackie said.  

79
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,840
She remembered the phone call on 
Thursday about the train ticket.

80
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,400
'I don't like cheap things,' Diane said.  

81
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:46,800
'And I'm going to need more money soon. I want 
to go to America. Can you help me, Roger?'

82
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,080
'Oh no,' Roger said. 'Nobody 
wants to help you, Diane.  

83
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:03,040
You don't like working, we all know 
that, but we all want you to get a job.'

84
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:14,480
Diane laughed. 'It doesn't matter, Roger. I 
don't need your help. Mother always helps me.  

85
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Mother loves me best.' She suddenly smiled, a 
quick, beautiful smile. But her eyes were cold.

86
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,560
Jackie looked at her mother. Molly's face 
was white. Jackie did not understand.  

87
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,960
Was her mother afraid of Diane? Jackie 
wanted her mother to be happy today.

88
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,920
'Would you like some more meat, Uncle Albert?'  

89
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,160
Jackie asked. 'Roger, can you 
give everyone some more to drink?'

90
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:07,520
Roger got up and began to give more wine 
to everyone. 'This is good wine,' he said.

91
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:18,800
Molly smiled for the first time. 'Yes, your 
father loved this wine. He often drank it.'

92
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,320
'Yes,' Albert said, and looked 
at Molly. 'Expensive, too.'

93
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,480
'Would you like to meet Mr 
Briggs this weekend, Roger?'  

94
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:40,480
Jackie asked quickly. 'He's the new 
man at the farm. He wants to meet you.'

95
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:52,080
'Briggs? Briggs?' Molly said, suddenly 
angry. 'Don't talk to me about that man.  

96
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:01,280
I don't like him. He wants half my garden 
for his farm. He needs more land, he says.  

97
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,400
I don't want him in my house. He's 
always dirty and he has bad teeth.'

98
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,840
Jackie stood up and got her bag. 
'Excuse me, I want a cigarette.'

99
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,880
'Cigarettes! Always a cigarette in your 
mouth,' Molly said. 'I don't like it.  

100
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,840
Cigarettes aren't good for you.'

101
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,880
Jackie began to smoke. She felt 
angry but she said nothing.  

102
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,960
She wanted her mother to be happy this 
evening, but it was very difficult.

103
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:01,520
Roger drank some more wine. 'Well, Mother, 
perhaps Mr Briggs is right. The garden is  

104
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,760
very big, you know,' he said. 
'It's a lot of work for you.  

105
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,320
The house is big, too. You're fifty 
now. You need to be more careful.'

106
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:29,840
'Roger! I don't need a nurse, you know! I work 
in the garden every day; I feel happy there.'  

107
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:41,360
Molly stood up. 'I know you all want my 
money. You come here for a free dinner,  

108
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:53,040
you don't want to see me. You don't love 
me. You want my house, and my money.  

109
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,640
Well, you can all wait. Nobody is getting 
more money from me, not before I die!'

110
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,840
'Don't say that, Mother!' Jackie cried.

111
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:22,320
Molly walked across the room to the door. 
'I feel ill now. I'm going upstairs to bed.'

112
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:36,560
Molly left the room. Nobody moved. 'One day I'm 
going to kill that woman,' Diane said quietly.

113
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Roger looked at Diane but said nothing. 
Albert moved his head slowly up and down.  

114
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:56,560
Ill! She's angry, that's all,' he 
said. 'Molly always gets angry about  

115
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:07,840
money. Why can't she be good to her sister? 
Annie's going to die soon. Molly knows that.'

116
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
Jackie finished her cigarette and stood up.  

117
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,840
'Would everyone like some coffee? Come into 
the kitchen and let's drink it there.'
 
 
 

118
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,560
CHAPTER THREE
 

119
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,640
Early next morning the house was quiet.  

120
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,760
Suddenly there was a cry from the room 
next to Roger's, his mother's room.  

121
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,120
Roger opened his eyes and looked at 
the clock. It was nearly seven o'clock.  

122
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:14,080
He got out of bed and opened the door quietly. At 
the same time the door of his mother's room opened  

123
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,880
and Diane came out. Her face was very white.

124
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:33,360
'Roger! It's Mother! I brought a cup 
of coffee for her and I found her dead.  

125
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,760
She's dead... dead in her bed,' she cried.

126
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Roger went quickly to the door of his mother's 
room and looked in. The window was open  

127
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:03,360
but the room was warm. Molly was on 
the bed, one hand under her head.  

128
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,720
Roger went across to the bed 
and put his hand on her arm.  

129
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:21,280
It was cold. On the little table next to the 
bed was a hot cup of coffee and an empty cup.

130
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
'I'm going to call the doctor,' Diane said.

131
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:41,840
'She's dead,' Roger said slowly. His 
face, too, was white. 'Mother is dead!'

132
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,800
Diane walked across the room to the door. 'I'm 
going to phone the doctor,' she said again.

133
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,280
'Wait a minute!' Roger called. 
'Let's tell the family first.'

134
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:12,880
'Family! Nobody loved Mother!' 
Diane went out and ran downstairs.

135
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:23,920
Roger slowly went downstairs after 
her and stood by the telephone.

136
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:37,840
'Dr Pratt, this is Diane Clarkson. It's my 
mother -she's dead. Can you come quickly?'

137
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:49,600
Diane put the phone down. 'It 
isn't true, Roger! Mother dead!  

138
00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:00,240
Daddy died last winter, and now 
Mother.' Diane began to cry.

139
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:11,920
'Don't cry, Diane,' Roger said. 'Let's go 
upstairs and tell Uncle Albert and Jackie.'

140
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:22,640
'No! You tell them! Nobody 
loved Mother. You aren't sorry.  

141
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,760
Look at you! You want her money. That's all.'

142
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,560
Roger suddenly wanted to hit 
Diane. 'Be quiet!' he said.  

143
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:50,800
'What about you? You didn't love Mother. You 
wanted her money, too. Don't forget that!'

144
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:03,600
'It's true,' Diane said. 'Oh, I can't 
stay in this house. I'm going out.  

145
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm going to the river with the dogs.'

146
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:17,120
'No,' Roger said. 'The doctor's 
coming and I want you here.'

147
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,480
Diane said nothing. She went into the kitchen 
and at once the dogs got up and came to her.  

148
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,440
'Beautiful dogs! Daddy loved 
you and Mother loved you.  

149
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:50,160
Now I'm going to love you.' She opened 
the back door and went out with the dogs.

150
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,840
Roger did not move. He stood by the telephone.  

151
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,000
'It's true,' he thought. 'I 
am happy about the money.  

152
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:17,120
I needed money, and now I'm rich. Things 
are going to be easier for me now.  

153
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:28,160
But Mother... why didn't I love 
her more? And now she's dead.'  

154
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:39,840
Slowly, Roger went back upstairs. He 
wanted to dress before Dr Pratt arrived.

155
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:50,000
Dr Pratt was a little fat man without 
much hair. He was the family doctor  

156
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:00,320
and he knew all the Clarkson family very well. 
He went upstairs at once and looked at Molly's  

157
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:09,120
body. He looked carefully at the cup of coffee 
and the empty cup on the table next to her bed.

158
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:19,840
'I'm sorry, Roger,' he said. 
'Where is Diane? She phoned me.'

159
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:31,200
'She went out with the dogs,' Roger said. 
'She was angry with me - angry with everyone.'

160
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,840
Dr Pratt said nothing for a minute.  

161
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,360
'This is going to be very difficult. 
I'm going to phone the police, Roger.'

162
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,960
'Police! Why? What's wrong?'

163
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:03,840
'I don't know. Your mother wasn't ill. I 
saw her on Thursday and she was very well.  

164
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,200
Why did she die? I don't 
understand. I want to find out.'

165
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:23,600
Roger went across to the window and looked out 
at the garden. It was a beautiful summer morning.  

166
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:35,440
The sky was blue and the garden was green. It 
was all very quiet. His mother loved this garden.  

167
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:48,720
But Tom Briggs wanted the garden. And Roger wanted 
the garden, too. Roger felt worse and worse.

168
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,000
'Your mother took sleeping tablets,' 
Dr Pratt said. 'Did you know?  

169
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:08,000
On Thursday she had a new bottle of tablets, 
but I can't find it here in her room.'

170
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:20,160
'I didn't know,' Roger said. 'Very well. Let's 
go downstairs and you can phone the police.'

171
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:31,200
Roger went into the kitchen and made some 
coffee. Just then Diane came in with the dogs.

172
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:42,960
'Roger,' she said. 'Look, I'm sorry. I 
was angry and said some angry things.'

173
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:55,840
'It doesn't matter,' Roger said. 'Here you are, 
have some coffee. Dr Pratt is phoning the police.  

174
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:05,520
Did you know Mother took sleeping tablets? 
Well, the bottle is not in her room.'

175
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:19,440
'What? I don't understand.' Diane took the coffee 
and began to drink. Her eyes looked big and dark.

176
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,960
Just then Dr Pratt came into the kitchen.  

177
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:35,200
'They're coming at once,' he said. 
'Diane - I'm sorry about your mother.'

178
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,320
'Dr Pratt, I want to tell you about last night.  

179
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,600
Everyone was very angry . . .' 
'Be quiet!' Roger said quickly.

180
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,320
'Diane never thinks before she opens 
her mouth,' he thought angrily.

181
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:09,040
Diane did not look at Roger. 'Last night Mother 
went to bed early because everyone . . .'

182
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,160
'Don't tell me,' Dr Pratt said. 
'You can tell the police.'

183
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:25,520
Roger's face went red. Suddenly he felt afraid. 
'The police are going to talk to everyone,  

184
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:36,720
and ask questions,' he thought. 'And they're going 
to want answers. It's going to be very difficult.'  

185
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
He finished his coffee and stood up.

186
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:52,400
'I'm going upstairs,' he said. 'I'm going to 
tell Uncle Albert and Jackie about Mother...  

187
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:01,840
and about the police.'
 
 
 

188
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,960
CHAPTER FOUR
 

189
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,800
The police arrived very quickly. 
There were a lot of them.  

190
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Some of them with cameras went upstairs to Molly's 
room. Two detectives talked to Dr Pratt in the  

191
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:39,280
kitchen. The family waited in the sitting room. 
It was a hot day again and the windows were open.  

192
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:50,320
The dogs sat quietly at Diane's 
feet. Nobody talked. Jackie smoked.  

193
00:28:52,400 --> 00:29:02,160
They waited for a long time. Suddenly the 
door opened and the two detectives came in.

194
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,720
'Good morning. I am Detective Inspector 
Walsh and this is Sergeant Foster.'  

195
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:25,840
The Inspector did not smile. He was a big man 
in an old black suit and a black hat and coat.  

196
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,880
He wore a coat because he always felt cold.

197
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,400
'Last night someone put sleeping 
tablets in Mrs Clarkson's hot milk.  

198
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,840
We are going to question everybody, 
and we need a room, please.'

199
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:58,640
Roger stood up. 'I'm Roger Clarkson. 
You can have my father's old office.  

200
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,280
Come with me, it's along here.'

201
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,640
The office was not a very big room,  

202
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,520
but there was a table and three or 
four chairs. Roger opened the window.

203
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,800
'I would like to talk first to your 
uncle, Albert King,' Inspector Walsh said.  

204
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,440
He took off his hat and coat 
and sat down behind the table.

205
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,360
'Of course,' said Roger and left the room.

206
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:51,520
Sergeant Foster waited by the door. He was a very 
tall young man with black hair and a nice smile.  

207
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,920
He was not very happy this morning because 
he usually played tennis on Sunday mornings.  

208
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
He was one of the best players 
at the Cambridge Tennis Club.

209
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,560
Albert came in and sat down.

210
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,680
'I'm going to ask some questions, Mr King,'  

211
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,040
the Inspector said, 'and Sergeant 
Foster is going to write it all down.'

212
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:33,120
Albert looked at his feet. 'Yes, 
yes. It's your job. I know that.'

213
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:45,840
'Tell me about last night,' Inspector Walsh asked 
quietly. 'You were angry with Mrs Clarkson.'

214
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Albert looked at Inspector Walsh for the 
first time. 'Yes, I was. Everyone was angry.  

215
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Roger was angry. Diane wanted money to 
go to America. Then there's a man called  

216
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:20,880
Tom Briggs... He wants half the garden 
for his farm. Molly was a rich woman.  

217
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:34,320
I need money because my wife Annie - Molly's 
sister - is very ill. I told Molly this.'

218
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
'What happened next?'

219
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,800
'Well, Molly was angry with 
everyone and went upstairs.  

220
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:57,040
We went into the kitchen for coffee. Jackie wanted 
everyone to go up and say good night to Molly.  

221
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,880
She lives here with Molly so 
she wanted Molly to be happy.  

222
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,960
At first Roger said no. He was angry 
and didn't want to see his mother.'

223
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,120
'And did you see Molly in her room?'

224
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,560
'Yes. I was tired and I went upstairs first.  

225
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,000
I went to Molly's room and 
asked her for money again.  

226
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:47,200
But no - there was no money for her sister.' 
Albert stopped and put his hand over his eyes.

227
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:58,480
Inspector Walsh watched Albert for a minute. 
'Did you hear noises after you went to bed?'

228
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,200
'Everyone went into Molly's room 
to say good night, I think. Later,  

229
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:19,840
I heard someone... He - or she - went 
downstairs. That was about midnight.'

230
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,400
'Very well, Mr King. Thank you, you 
can go now.' Albert left the room.

231
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,840
Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head.

232
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:44,560
'What time is it? I'm hungry. We're 
learning a lot, but I need some coffee.'

233
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,040
'Shall I go to the kitchen?' 
Sergeant Foster asked.

234
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,720
'Oh, no. Later. Let's see Jackie Clarkson next.'

235
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,720
Jackie came in and sat down. She looked 
down at her hands and said nothing.

236
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,320
'We found the empty bottle of your 
mother's sleeping tablets in Diane's room,'  

237
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:27,840
the Inspector said suddenly. Then he 
waited. Jackie's face did not change  

238
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:38,240
and she said nothing. 'Tell me, did your mother 
get her tablets from the shop in the village?'

239
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:49,840
'Yes. My mother usually took a sleeping tablet 
every night so she needed a lot of tablets.  

240
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,840
Sometimes she got them from 
the shop, sometimes I did.  

241
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:08,800
On Thursday, I asked Peter Hobbs to get 
them. He lives in the house across the road,  

242
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,840
and he often goes to the village on his bicycle.'

243
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:28,080
'I see. Your mother wanted to stay in this 
house. How about you? Did you want to move?'

244
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,520
Jackie looked up for a minute 
and then down at her hands again.  

245
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,040
'This is Mother's house. I loved 
my mother. She was good to me.'

246
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,120
'Did you see your mother in her room last night?'

247
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,800
'Yes, everyone did. Diane made 
hot milk and took it to Mother.  

248
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,840
She usually drank a cup of 
hot milk before she slept.'

249
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:19,040
Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head. 
Jackie was very quiet. 'What did your mother say?'

250
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,600
Jackie opened her bag and looked 
for a cigarette. 'Can I smoke?'

251
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:37,520
'Of course. This is your house,' 
Inspector Walsh said. He watched Jackie.  

252
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,920
'What did your mother say?' he asked again.

253
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:56,720
'She wanted to go downstairs again. She remembered 
the dogs - she wanted to get some dinner for them.  

254
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,840
I went to my room and she went downstairs.'

255
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
'What time was this?'

256
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,840
'I don't remember. About midnight, I think.'

257
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
'And the cup of hot milk?'

258
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,080
'It was on the table by her bed.'

259
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,360
'Did you need your mother's money?'

260
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,600
'No, Inspector. Money is not important to me.  

261
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,920
There are more important 
things,' Jackie said quietly.

262
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:54,160
'Well, your uncle Albert wanted money. Tom 
Briggs wanted the garden. You wanted nothing?'

263
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,160
Jackie finished her cigarette and looked up at 
the Inspector. Her eyes were suddenly angry.  

264
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:15,120
'Don't forget Peter Hobbs. He lost his job because 
of my mother. He wanted to kill her, you know.  

265
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,960
And what about Diane? You found 
the empty bottle in her bag.'

266
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,960
Inspector Walsh listened carefully. 'We're 
going to question everyone, Miss Clarkson.'

267
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,400
Jackie said nothing for a minute. 'Would you 
like some sandwiches and coffee, Inspector?'

268
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:55,840
'Ah! Yes, please!' Inspector Walsh said warmly. 
'I would like sandwiches and coffee very much.'

269
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:05,920
Jackie left the room. Inspector Walsh thought 
about her. Why was she suddenly angry?  

270
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,160
The room was quiet.
 
 
 

271
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,840
CHAPTER FIVE
 

272
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:37,120
After the coffee and sandwiches, Inspector Walsh 
called Roger Clarkson to the office. Roger came in  

273
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,400
and sat down. The Inspector began at once.

274
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,840
'Now, Mr Clarkson. Why was your 
mother angry with you last night?'

275
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:04,080
'This house is very big,' Roger said. 'It was 
a lot of work for Mother. I wanted her to move.  

276
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:12,080
But no, she loved this house and 
garden. She didn't want to move.'

277
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:26,240
'Tell me about your job, Mr Clarkson. Your mother 
is dead and now you're rich. Do you need money?'

278
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:37,440
Roger's face was suddenly afraid. 'What 
are you saying? I didn't kill my mother.  

279
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:49,360
I need money, that's true. A friend and I 
want to build ten houses here, in this garden.  

280
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:59,120
We can get a lot of money for them. 
So I wanted Mother to sell this house.  

281
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:08,640
It's true. But Mr Briggs wanted half the 
garden, too, you know, for his farm.'

282
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,680
Inspector Walsh moved a pencil on the table.  

283
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:22,720
'Tell me, what happened upstairs? 
You went to your mother's room?'

284
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,960
'Yes, I did. I wanted to 
say goodnight to my mother.'

285
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,520
'Did you talk about the house again?'

286
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:45,840
'Yes, I did. Again, she said no. She loved 
the house and didn't want to sell it.'

287
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,120
Inspector Walsh watched Roger for a minute.  

288
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:02,880
'I see. We found the empty bottle of sleeping 
tablets, Mr Clarkson, in Diane's room.'

289
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,560
Roger's face did not change.  

290
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:21,040
'Oh? Someone put them there. Diane did not kill 
my mother, I know that. She found the body.'

291
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,920
'Very well. I would like to see Diane next.'

292
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,640
Roger got up and left the room.

293
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,840
Inspector Walsh stood up and 
put his hands in his pockets.  

294
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,720
He went to the window and looked out at the trees.  

295
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:56,000
Why was Roger Clarkson afraid? Was it 
important? He looked at Sergeant Foster.

296
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:05,120
'Tomorrow morning, go to Mr Clarkson's 
office - you have the name,' he said.

297
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:13,040
'Ask some questions about him, 
about his job, friends, money.'

298
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,080
Sergeant Foster wrote it down. 'Yes, Inspector.'

299
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,920
'A good day for tennis, Sergeant?'

300
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,000
Sergeant Foster laughed. 'Don't 
say that. It's not easy, you know.  

301
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,320
I don't like sitting here looking at the sun.'

302
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:47,280
Diane came into the room and sat down. 
She looked at Sergeant Foster and smiled.  

303
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,440
'I saw you at the Tennis Club last 
month, I think. You play very well.'

304
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,920
Sergeant Foster's face went red.  

305
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:10,560
Inspector Walsh looked at him. 'Oh yes. A 
fast and exciting player is Sergeant Foster.'

306
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,840
Diane smiled again at Sergeant 
Foster and his face went redder.

307
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:27,280
'Well, Miss Clarkson,' Inspector Walsh 
said, 'I want you to talk about last night.'

308
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:39,600
Diane stopped smiling. 'Oh, I can talk about 
last night. I can't stop talking about it.  

309
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:49,520
We were all angry. Mother went to bed 
early and I made hot milk for her.  

310
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,080
We were all in the kitchen, 
and Peter Hobbs came in.  

311
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,040
He nearly broke the back 
door down.' Diane stopped.

312
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:04,880
'Yes?'

313
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:16,320
'He was very angry about a letter. He wanted 
to kill Mother. Are you going to talk to him?'

314
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,760
'We're going to talk to everyone.'

315
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:29,360
'Good. Tom Briggs came into the kitchen, 
too. Are you going to talk to him?'

316
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:38,480
'I'm asking the questions, Miss Clarkson. 
When did you take the milk upstairs?'

317
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:47,760
'I went up after Roger.' She stopped 
for a minute. Then she began again.  

318
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:56,880
'I didn't like my mother, Inspector. 
She killed my father, you know.  

319
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:09,840
Last winter, after Christmas, she drove 
the car into a tree and killed my father.'

320
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:21,280
Inspector Walsh watched Diane's face carefully. 
'I see. So you wanted to kill your mother?'

321
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,360
Diane laughed. 'I wanted 
to kill her, but I didn't.  

322
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:39,840
I can tell you a lot of things about this 
family, Inspector. Everyone wanted Mother to die.  

323
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:48,800
Uncle Albert wanted her money for 
his wife, Annie. And then my brother.

324
00:47:49,920 --> 00:48:00,640
He needs a lot of money. He has an expensive 
house and an expensive car. And think of Jackie.  

325
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,840
Do you know that Jackie didn't like Mother?  

326
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:17,120
A long time ago, a nice boy worked here. He 
was the gardener. Jackie loved him very much,  

327
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:26,320
but Mother said no. A gardener was not 
a good husband for a Clarkson girl!'

328
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:40,720
Inspector Walsh listened quietly. All this was 
very interesting but was it important? Perhaps.  

329
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,840
What a happy family the Clarksons were!

330
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:58,480
'We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets 
in your room,' Inspector Walsh said quietly.  

331
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,240
He watched her face carefully.

332
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,160
Diane stood up suddenly, her face angry. 'What?  

333
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:21,120
I didn't put it there! I'm not going to 
listen to this!' She ran out of the room.

334
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:33,680
'Well, well, well,' Inspector Walsh said. 'She 
likes you, Sergeant. You need to be careful.'

335
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:44,000
Sergeant Foster laughed but 
his face went red again.

336
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,600
'Someone put sleeping tablets in Molly's hot 
milk,' the Inspector said. 'All the family were  

337
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:06,480
in the kitchen last night. Peter Hobbs and Tom 
Briggs were there, too. One of them killed Molly.'

338
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,240
Inspector Walsh got his hat and coat. 'Come on. 
We need to talk to Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs.  

339
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:39,840
Let's get some more coffee first. I'd like 
a sandwich, too. I'm hungry again!'
 
 
 

340
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,320
CHAPTER SIX
 

341
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,600
They found Peter Hobbs under 
his car - an old green car.  

342
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,200
He got up slowly. He wore old blue 
trousers and a dirty orange shirt.

343
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,640
'We want to talk about Mrs 
Clarkson,' Inspector Walsh said.

344
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,840
'Oh, it's about her,' Peter 
said. He looked at the Inspector.  

345
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,240
'I know she's dead. Someone 
in the village told me.'

346
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,480
'Why did you go to the 
Clarksons' house last night?'

347
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,200
'Jackie wanted me to come and see her 
brother, Roger. "You're angry," she said.  

348
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:47,200
"Come and tell Roger." I went to the 
house but nobody opened the door.  

349
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,920
So I made a lot of noise and 
then they opened the door.  

350
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:07,280
Old Mrs Clarkson wasn't there. But I told Roger. 
I told them all!' Peter hit the car with his hand.  

351
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:18,720
'I wanted to kill that woman. I lost 
my job, my first job, because of her.  

352
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:29,600
Last month I was in trouble with the police 
and that old woman wrote to my office  

353
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,800
and she told them about the 
police. I wanted to kill her!'

354
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,840
'Take it easy!' Inspector Walsh 
said. 'What happened next?'

355
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,720
'Jackie gave me some coffee,  

356
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,080
but her brother didn't listen to me,' Peter 
said angrily. 'Then Tom Briggs came in.

357
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,400
He wanted to talk to Roger, too. 
But Roger didn't listen to him.  

358
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:18,880
Jackie was very unhappy - she nearly 
cried. Then I went home. That's all.'

359
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:30,320
'I see. Now tell me about the tablets. 
You went to the village on Thursday?'

360
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:42,240
'Tablets? Oh, yes. I remember. Jackie wanted me 
to get her mother's tablets from the village.  

361
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,200
I go to the village on my 
bicycle - this car doesn't work.'

362
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,200
'Thank you, Peter. That's all.'

363
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:10,320
'That's all?' Peter laughed angrily. 'You're going 
to come back, I know that! I know the police!'

364
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:18,480
Tom Briggs' farm was about half a mile 
away, near the river. It was not a big farm,  

365
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,080
and the house was old and dirty.

366
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,200
'Not much money here,' Inspector Walsh said.

367
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,920
Tom Briggs was a young man, about 
thirty years old, with dirty hands  

368
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:45,600
and bad teeth. 'What's wrong? Excuse 
me, I'm eating my dinner,' he said.

369
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,840
'We can wait. Finish your 
dinner,' Inspector Walsh said.  

370
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,560
'We want to ask one or two 
questions about last night.'

371
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,840
'Come and wait in the front room,' 
Tom said and opened the door.

372
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:16,400
Inspector Walsh looked at the things in the front 
room. There was an old black and white television,  

373
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:26,560
and some books on the table. There was a picture 
of a happy young girl with long brown hair  

374
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:37,280
on the table, too. Inspector Walsh looked at 
the picture for a long time. Who was the girl?

375
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,320
Tom Briggs came back into the front room.

376
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:52,000
'Finished?' Inspector Walsh asked. 
'You know Mrs Clarkson is dead?'

377
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:02,320
Tom Briggs sat down suddenly on the 
nearest chair. 'What? How did she die?  

378
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,480
When did it happen? I was there last night.'

379
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:18,000
'She died last night or early this 
morning. What did you do last night?'

380
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:32,000
'Me? Why are you asking me? I went there to meet 
Mr Clarkson - Roger. I'm losing money on this farm  

381
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,640
and I need more land. I want 
half Mrs Clarkson's garden.'

382
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,520
'You went into the kitchen. What 
did you do next? Can you remember?'

383
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,360
Tom Briggs looked at Sergeant Foster 
and then back at Inspector Walsh.  

384
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:07,360
'I remember it very well. All the family were 
in the kitchen. Peter Hobbs was there, too.  

385
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:18,720
I talked to Roger. He wants his mother 
to sell the house. But he wants the land.  

386
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:30,160
He doesn't want me to have it. But now Mrs 
Clarkson is dead. What's going to happen now?'

387
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:41,520
Inspector Walsh got up and took the picture 
of the girl from the table. 'Who's this?'

388
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:55,920
Tom's face went red. 'Who? Oh! That's a 
friend. It's not ... It was a long time ago.'

389
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,840
The two detectives walked back to the 
Clarksons' house through the garden.  

390
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:13,600
It was beautiful, green and quiet. 
Inspector Walsh felt tired and hungry.  

391
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:24,560
Who killed Molly? He knew the answer now, but 
he needed to ask one or two more questions.

392
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:35,840
'Let's go, Sergeant,' he said, and put on 
his hat again. 'Tomorrow is a new day.'
 
 
 
 
 

393
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,840
CHAPTER SEVEN
 

394
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,680
On Monday morning Sergeant Foster went to 
Roger's office and asked some questions.  

395
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:05,120
And then he went to Albert's house 
and asked some more questions.  

396
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:18,720
Inspector Walsh sat in his office and telephoned. 
He made phone calls about Peter Hobbs and he  

397
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:27,280
made phone calls about Tom Briggs. And 
then he had some coffee and sandwiches.

398
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:35,440
At three o'clock the two detectives 
drove to the Clarksons' house.

399
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,280
'I would like to see everyone,' he told Roger.

400
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,800
Everyone came into the sitting room and sat down.

401
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:55,760
Inspector Walsh stood in front of the 
windows and looked at them, one by one.  

402
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:09,280
'I want to talk to you. Someone killed 
Molly Clarkson. Someone put sleeping tablets  

403
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:17,440
in her hot milk and killed her. Nobody 
wanted to tell me the true story,  

404
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:27,840
but now I know the true story 
and I'm going to tell you.'

405
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,240
The two dogs came slowly into the 
room and sat down at Diane's feet.  

406
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,520
It was very quiet in the room.

407
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:50,480
The Inspector looked at Albert. 'Mr King, 
your wife is very ill and needs a nurse.  

408
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,960
You told me this. You didn't 
tell me about your house.  

409
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,640
You're selling your house next 
month because you need the money.'

410
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:19,840
Albert was angry. 'Last year I asked Molly's 
husband for some money, and he said yes.  

411
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,920
But then he died in an accident.'

412
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:40,800
'Accident!' Diane cried. 'That was no accident. 
Mother killed Daddy because she wanted his money!'

413
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,960
'Let's talk about you now, 
Diane,' said Inspector Walsh.  

414
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,800
'You visited your mother every 
month and you took money from her.  

415
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:09,680
Last month she gave you money for your television. 
This month she gave you money for your telephone.  

416
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,480
Every month you told your mother:  

417
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:23,200
"It was no accident; you killed 
Daddy. I'm going to tell the police."  

418
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:33,840
Your mother was afraid of the police 
and so she gave you the money.  

419
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,160
But in the end she wanted to stop you.

420
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:56,400
She told Dr Pratt. No more money, she told Dr 
Pratt on Thursday; and on Saturday she died.  

421
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,960
You took the hot milk to your 
mother - what did she tell you?'

422
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:19,920
Diane began to cry. 'I loved Daddy! He 
always gave money to me; he loved me.  

423
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:29,840
It was Mother - she didn't love 
Daddy and she didn't love me.'  

424
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:40,320
Diane stopped. The dogs got up 
and went to the door. 'It's true,  

425
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,560
I took a lot of money from Mother.  

426
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:57,840
On Saturday she told me - no more money. 
I wanted to kill her, but I didn't.'

427
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,560
The dogs came back and sat 
down again at Diane's feet.

428
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:14,400
Inspector Walsh looked at Roger. 
'Mr Clarkson also needed money.'

429
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:22,000
Roger's face went red. 'Don't tell them! Please!'

430
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:34,080
'Mr Clarkson lost his job last 
month. He has no money. But he has  

431
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:44,000
an expensive house and an expensive 
car. He likes expensive things.'

432
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:54,800
His sisters looked at him, but Roger put 
his hand over his eyes. 'Don't talk to me!'

433
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:03,520
'It doesn't matter now!' 
Diane said. 'Mother is dead  

434
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,680
and we have a lot of money. You don't need a job.'

435
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,800
Roger's face went red again. 'Be quiet, Diane!'

436
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:27,840
'Now,' Inspector Walsh began again. 
'Peter Hobbs is a very angry young man.  

437
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:38,000
Mrs Clarkson was not very nice to him. He 
got the sleeping tablets from the shop.  

438
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:46,720
But did he put the tablets 
in the hot milk? I think not.

439
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:59,040
Tom Briggs wanted half the garden for his 
farm. He was in the kitchen that night.  

440
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:08,720
Did he put sleeping tablets 
in the hot milk? I think not.'

441
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:17,840
Suddenly it began to rain. For a minute 
everyone watched it through the window.  

442
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,240
Jackie took a cigarette from 
her bag and began to smoke.

443
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:33,440
'But someone wanted Peter Hobbs to 
come into the kitchen that night.  

444
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:42,720
She wanted everyone to see him, and 
listen to him,' Inspector Walsh said.

445
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:52,160
'She...? I don't understand,' 
Roger began, and stopped.

446
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:04,880
Inspector Walsh moved away from the window and sat 
down. 'I'm going to tell you the true story now.  

447
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:14,880
Miss Clarkson, you wanted Peter Hobbs 
to come to the house that night.  

448
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,960
He was very angry with your 
mother because of that letter.  

449
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:33,360
He said: "I want to kill her." And you 
wanted everyone to hear that. Why?'

450
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:43,440
Jackie's face went white. 'It's 
not true! What about Diane?  

451
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,320
You found the empty bottle in her bag!'

452
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:58,720
Diane stood up. 'In my bag? Jackie! 
What are you talking about?'

453
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:10,960
'Be quiet, please, and sit down,' 
Inspector Walsh said. He looked at Jackie.  

454
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:23,840
'It's true: we found the bottle in Diane's bag. 
But how do you know that? We didn't tell you.'

455
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,960
'You did... before... you told me before!'

456
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:40,400
'No. We found the empty bottle in Diane's room.

457
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,760
We told you that.  

458
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:56,800
You talked about Diane's bag; we didn't tell 
you. Sergeant Foster wrote it all down.'  

459
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:10,240
Inspector Walsh looked carefully at Jackie. 
'A long time ago, you knew Tom Briggs.  

460
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:21,600
He was the gardener here and you loved 
him. But your mother didn't like him.'

461
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,360
Jackie put her hands to her head. 'No! No!'

462
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:37,920
'We found your picture - an 
old one - in Mr Briggs' house.  

463
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:49,760
You were younger then, and your hair was 
long. Last year Tom Briggs came back,  

464
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,160
and you wanted him. He loved you, too,  

465
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:10,080
but he had no money. He wanted the garden 
for his farm, he wanted money, he wanted you.  

466
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:26,080
But your mother said no. In the end, you wanted 
to kill your mother... and you did kill her.  

467
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,720
Your mother went downstairs to see the dogs  

468
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:47,760
and you put the sleeping tablets in her hot milk. 
Later, you put the empty bottle in Diane's bag.'

469
01:10:50,800 --> 01:11:00,480
Jackie stood up. Her eyes were dark and 
afraid. 'You don't understand!' she cried.  

470
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:13,040
'Mother gave me nothing ... all those years. 
I wanted to be happy ... to be with Tom.  

471
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:27,680
That's all. I love Tom, and he loves 
me. But Mother said no. Always no.'  

472
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,080
Then she began to cry. Nobody looked at her.

473
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:50,240
Jackie left the house in a police car. Inspector 
Walsh watched and then walked slowly to his car.  

474
01:11:52,320 --> 01:12:00,160
He felt tired and hungry. He stopped 
and looked back at the house.

475
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:16,640
'Well,' he said to Sergeant Foster, 'in the 
end, they got the money: Albert, Roger, Diane.  

476
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:26,160
They're all rich now. But 
are they going to be happy?'

477
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:47,920
He got into the car. 'Let's go,' he said. 
'I'm hungry; I need a sandwich.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

478
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,595
- THE END -
