CHAPTER ONE
The Californian's Tale

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,630
When I was young I went looking for gold in
California.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:18,160
I never found enough to make me rich, but
I did discover a beautiful part of the country.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,690
It was called the Stanislaus.

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,960
The Stanislaus was like heaven on earth.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,360
It had bright green hills and deep forests
where soft winds touched the trees.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:44,999
Other men, also looking for gold, had reached
the Stanislaus Hills of California many years

8
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:47,860
before I did.

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:55,140
They had built a town in the valley with sidewalks
and stores, banks and schools.

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,399
They had also built pretty little houses for
their families.

11
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:10,350
At first, they found a lot of gold in the
Stanislaw Hills, but their good luck did not

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,770
last.

13
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,850
After a few years the gold disappeared.

14
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:24,950
By the time I reached the Stanislaus all the
people were gone, too.

15
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:33,409
Grass now grew in the streets and the little
houses were covered by wild rose bushes.

16
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:40,969
Only the sound of insects filled the air as
I walked through the empty town that summer

17
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,110
day so long ago.

18
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:51,689
Then, I realized I was not alone after all.

19
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,780
A man was smiling at me as he stood in front
of one of the little houses.

20
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,329
This house was not covered by wild rose bushes.

21
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:09,600
A nice little garden in front of the house
was full of blue and yellow flowers.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,760
White curtains hung from the windows and floated
in the soft summer wind.

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:25,390
Still smiling the man opened the door of his
house and motioned to me.

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,480
I went inside and could not believe my eyes.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,989
I had been living for weeks in rough mining
camps with other gold miners.

26
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:46,019
We slept on the hard ground, ate canned beans
from cold metal plates and spent our days

27
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,980
in the difficult search for gold.

28
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,130
Here, in this little house my spirit seemed
to come to.

29
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,400
life again.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,330
I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor.

31
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:09,700
Pictures hung all around the room, and on
little tables there were sea-shells, books

32
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,510
and China vases full of flowers.

33
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:21,420
A woman had made this house into a home.

34
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,680
The pleasure I felt in my heart must have
shown on my face.

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,750
The man read my thoughts.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,750
"Yes," he smiled.

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,570
"It is all her work.

38
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:40,349
Everything in this room has felt the touch
of her hand."

39
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,920
One of the pictures on the wall was not hanging
straight.

40
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,980
He noticed it and went to fix it.

41
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,730
He stepped back several times to make sure
the picture was really straight.

42
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,790
Then he gave it a gentle touch with his hand.

43
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,260
"She always does that," he explained to me.

44
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:14,360
"It is like the finishing pat a mother gives
her child's hair after she has brushed it.

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,890
I have seen her fix all these things so often
that I can do it Just the way she does.

46
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,410
I don't know why I do it.

47
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,639
I Just do it."

48
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:37,139
As he talked, I realized there was something
in this room that he wanted me to discover.

49
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,530
I looked around.

50
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,500
When my eyes reached the corner of the room
near the fireplace he broke into a happy laugh

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,620
and rubbed his hands together.

52
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,830
"That's it!" he cried out.

53
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,820
"You have found it!

54
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,130
I knew you would.

55
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,300
It is her picture."

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,039
I went to a little black shelf that held a
small picture of the most beautiful woman

57
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,229
I had ever seen.

58
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:18,960
There was a sweetness and softness in the
woman's expression that I had never seen before.

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,710
The man took the picture from my hands and
stared at it.

60
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,540
"She was nineteen on her last birthday.

61
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,130
That was the day we were married.

62
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,570
When you see her - oh, just wait until you
meet her."

63
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,449
"Where is she now?"

64
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,600
I asked.

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:48,680
"Oh - she is away," the man sighed putting
the picture back on the little black shelf.

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,270
"She went to visit her parents.

67
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,660
They live forty or fifty miles from here.

68
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,330
She has been gone two weeks today."

69
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,259
"When will she be back?"

70
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,340
I asked.

71
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,880
"Well, this is Wednesday," he said slowly.

72
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:17,250
"She will be back on Saturday, in the evening."

73
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,220
I felt a sharp sense of regret.

74
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,759
"I am sorry because I will be gone by then,"
I said.

75
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,759
"Gone?

76
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,889
No, why should you go.

77
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,630
Don't go, she will be so sorry.

78
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,919
You see, she likes to have people come and
stay with us."

79
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,449
"No, I really must leave," I said firmly.

80
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,760
He picked up her picture and held it before
my eyes.

81
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,160
"Here," he said.

82
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:08,610
"Now, you tell her to her face that you could
have stayed to meet her and you would not."

83
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,229
Something made me change my mind, as I looked
at the picture for a second time.

84
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:19,610
I decided to stay.

85
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,240
The man told me his name was Henry.

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,460
That night Henry and I talked about many different
things, but mainly about her.

87
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,830
The next day passed quietly.

88
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,590
Thursday evening we had a visitor.

89
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,280
He was a big gray-haired miner named Tom.

90
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,340
"I Just came for a few minutes to ask when
she's corning home." he explained.

91
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,020
"Is there any news?"

92
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,789
"Oh, yes," the man replied.

93
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,270
"I got a letter.

94
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,330
Would you like to hear it?"

95
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,650
He took a yellowed letter out of his shirt
pocket and read it to us.

96
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:15,849
It was full of loving messages to him and
to other people - their close friends and

97
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,659
neighbors.

98
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:23,750
When the man finished reading it, he looked
at his friend.

99
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,870
"Oh, no, you are doing it again, Tom.

100
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,720
You always cry when I read a letter from her.

101
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,540
I'm going to tell her this time."

102
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,710
"No, you must not do that, Henry," the gray-haired
miner said.

103
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:46,690
"I am getting old and any little sorrow makes
me cry.

104
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,570
I really was hoping she would be here tonight."

105
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,650
The next day, Friday, another old miner came
to visit.

106
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,820
He asked to hear the letter.

107
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,700
The message in it made him cry, too.

108
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:16,500
"We all miss her so much," he said.

109
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,350
Saturday finally came.

110
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:25,320
I found I was looking at my watch very often.

111
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,860
Henry noticed this.

112
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:35,000
"You don't think something has happened to
her, do you?" he asked me.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,520
I smiled and said that I was sure she was
just fine.

114
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,430
But he did not seem satisfied.

115
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:55,660
I was glad to see his two friends Tom and
Joe coming down the road as the sun began

116
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,500
to set.

117
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,410
The old miners were carrying guitars.

118
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,470
They also brought flowers and a bottle of
whiskey.

119
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:16,340
They put the flowers in vases and began to
play some fast and lively songs on their guitars.

120
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:23,470
Henry's friends kept giving him glasses of
whiskey which they made him drink.

121
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:30,900
When I reached for one of the glasses left
on the table Tom stopped my arm.

122
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,230
"Drop that glass and take the other one,"
he whispered.

123
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:46,960
He gave the remaining glass of whiskey to
Henry Just as the clock began to strike midnight.

124
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:57,330
Henry emptied the glass, his face grew whiter
and whiter.

125
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,680
"Boys," he said.

126
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,750
"I am feeling sick.

127
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,190
I want to lie down."

128
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:16,350
Henry was asleep almost before the words were
out of his mouth.

129
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,520
In a moment, his two friends had picked him
up and carried him into the bedroom.

130
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,440
They closed the door and came back.

131
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:35,170
They seemed to be getting ready to leave,
so I said, "Please, don't go, gentlemen.

132
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:41,570
She will not know me, I am a stranger to her."

133
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,850
They looked at each other.

134
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,590
"His wife has been dead for nineteen years,"
Tom said.

135
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,590
"Dead?"

136
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,370
I whispered.

137
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,000
"That or worse," he said.

138
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,860
"She went to see her parents about six months
after she got married.

139
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:13,210
On the way back on a Saturday evening in June
when she was almost here the Indians captured

140
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,000
her.

141
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,390
No one ever saw her again.

142
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,310
Henry lost his mind.

143
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,640
He thinks she is still alive.

144
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,870
When June comes, he thinks she has gone on
her trip to see her parents.

145
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,960
Then he begins to wait for her to come back.

146
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:50,730
He gets out that old letter and we come around
to visit, so he can read it to us.

147
00:12:50,730 --> 00:13:00,680
On the Saturday night, she is supposed to
come home; we come here to be with him.

148
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,850
We put a sleeping drug in his drink, so he
will sleep through the night.

149
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,300
Then he is all right for another year."

150
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:20,540
Joe picked up his hat and his guitar.

151
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:27,550
"We have done this every June for nineteen
years," he said.

152
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,460
"The first year, there were twenty-seven of
us.

153
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,900
Now just the two of us are left."

154
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:48,640
He opened the door of the pretty little house,
and the two old men disappeared Into the darkness

155
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,790
of the Stanislaus.

156
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,490
- THE END -
