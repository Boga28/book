00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,840
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,120
The past and the future

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,160
The train was really flying along now.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,200
The buildings, fields and 
trees all seemed to race by.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,160
A bridge shot past the window.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,400
Then a station.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,040
Hiro put his face nearer 
the glass to see the name,  

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,960
but they were travelling so 
fast it was impossible to read.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,160
Hiro wondered if they were travelling 
faster than the Shinkansen,  

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,120
the world-famous Bullet Train of Japan.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,440
He looked up at the small screen above the door, 
which showed the speed - 294 kilometres per hour!

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,160
He watched the numbers as they slowly increased.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,900
296 ...

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,360
298 ...

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,920
All of a sudden, they were there: 301 kph!

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,800
Well, that was something exciting to tell...

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,360
And then it hit him all over again.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,200
Yes, but who would he tell?

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,040
If it had been a month ago - even two 
weeks - he would have sent Akiko a text.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,640
But since their break-up she 
didn't want to hear from him.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,920
'Don't send me any messages, because I 
won't reply,' she had told him angrily.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,320
'If you'd rather have a photo of Yuki 
than me on your phone, that's fine.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
Just don't expect me to be 
your girlfriend any more!'

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,240
Hiro looked sadly out of the window again.

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,320
Where were they?

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,040
He knew they'd left Belgium and were in Germany  

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,160
now because he'd seen a sign 
just before the last station.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,560
But what city came next?

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Was it Koln?

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,280
In Koln, Hiro had to change trains.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,120
He wondered if he should ask the 
middle-aged woman sitting opposite.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,760
But just when he had decided not to,  

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,960
the train flew past a village and the 
woman suddenly spoke to him in English.

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
'Ha!' she said.

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,920
'There's my village!

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,120
I'll be home in an hour.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,680
It's only ten minutes to Koln!'

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
Hiro smiled politely.

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,800
The woman was a little bossy looking 
and never seemed to sit still.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,160
'But you are a long way from home...'

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,640
she went on.

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
'Are you Japanese?'

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Hiro nodded.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,600
He didn't feel much like chatting, 
but it was clear the woman did.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,920
'Yes,' he said, 'but I'm studying in England.

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm on a Study Year Abroad programme.

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,840
This is my summer holiday.'

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,320
'Very good!

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,480
And where are you going?' she went on.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
'Berlin.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,960
I have an InterRail ticket,' Hiro answered,  

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,560
then seeing the confused look on her 
face, guessed he'd better explain.

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,720
'That means I can use my ticket 
to travel anywhere in Europe.

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,960
Berlin is my first stop.'

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
'How exciting!

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,760
But you're travelling alone.

57
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,600
That's very brave.'

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,800
Hiro paused.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
'My friends...'

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
he began.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,880
'My friends...

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,120
couldn't come.'

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,880
'Oh, that's too bad,' the woman answered.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,040
She was about to say something 
else when her mobile phone rang.

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,720
She searched excitedly in her bag, then began 
a loud conversation in German on her phone.

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
Hiro picked up his book.

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,600
It was an American thriller - he'd 
brought it with him to practise  

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,440
his English - and with two violent 
murders already it was quite exciting.

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,040
But Hiro couldn't read now.

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,320
He thought sadly about what 
he'd just told the woman.

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,960
It wasn't really the truth.

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,280
The truth was that he and Akiko had 
planned to have a holiday together,  

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,800
but after their argument everything had changed.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,640
They'd been so happy all the 
time they'd been together.

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,680
She was on the same course in England 
and they'd met in the first week.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
And they'd never argued at all.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
So, then to get jealous about a dog!

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
That was just crazy!

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,640
Hiro reached into his pocket and 
took out his own mobile phone.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,440
With one easy movement, he opened it 
and watched the screen come to life.

81
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,000
For a moment or two he looked 
at his screensaver - the picture  

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,240
that appeared when he turned on his phone.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,960
It was a photo of Yuki, his beautiful 
twelve-year-old golden retriever,  

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,000
the most wonderful dog in the world.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,320
Then he chose 'My photos' from the 
menu on the side of the screen.

86
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,240
Almost immediately, a picture of Akiko appeared.

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,200
It was his favourite photo of her - the one at the 
restaurant where he'd taken her for her birthday.

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,760
She looked so happy and so pretty!

89
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,440
Hiro shook his head and quickly 
went back to the picture of the dog.

90
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,600
The argument had come out of nowhere.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,760
They'd been planning a beach 
holiday in southern Spain.

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,600
When he'd invited his friends Ayumu 
and Daijiro and their girlfriends,  

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Akiko had seemed happy enough.

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,200
But then something had changed.

95
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:17,640
He said he wished they could take Yuki as 
well, and all of sudden Akiko had got angry.

96
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,880
After that everything Hiro said 
seemed to make her angrier.

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,960
She'd started talking about his screensaver,  

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,800
and the next thing he knew she was shouting 
that she didn't want to see him ever again.

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
It was just unbelievable.

100
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
One moment he had a 
girlfriend, the next he didn't.

101
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,680
Now, apparently, she'd gone off to 
Scotland with a couple of her friends.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,480
But he wasn't even sure of that.

103
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Their eight-month relationship 
had just exploded like a bomb.

104
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,520
All of a sudden Hiro realised a 
tear was running down his cheek.

105
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Angrily, he brushed it away.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,600
The woman opposite was still talking loudly 
into her phone, so she hadn't seen the tear.

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,920
But this was no way for a 
twenty-year-old Japanese man to behave.

108
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,280
Hurriedly, he got out his InterRail 
map and pretended to study it closely.

109
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,120
He'd left London that morning very early and 
taken the Eurostar to Brussels in Belgium.

110
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:37,080
From there he'd caught this train going to Koln, 
and in Koln he would get the train to Berlin.

111
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,280
But where would he go after that?

112
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,880
Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, 
was only five hours by train from Berlin.

113
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,920
Then, he could go to Vienna, maybe.

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,000
If there was time he might even get to Budapest.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
How many new countries would he visit this trip?

116
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,800
If he went to all those 
cities, it would make five!

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,040
Hiro began to feel more cheerful.

118
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,520
He sat up and looked out of the window 
again at the countryside flying past.

119
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
It seemed different and new all of a sudden.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,120
'Yes,' Hiro thought, 'I will have 
an exciting and adventurous holiday.

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,360
I'm not going to be sad.

122
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,480
From this moment, Akiko is part of history.

123
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:39,560
No more looking back; I will only look 
forward from now on.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

124
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,680
CHAPTER TWO

125
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,960
A meeting with a shark

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,840
The train raced on for five minutes 
more, then began to slow down.

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,800
The woman closed her phone and 
busily collected her things together.

128
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,040
'So, Koln!' she said brightly and stood up.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,520
'Now I must find my husband and 
you must go to the Berlin train.

130
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,560
Platform 2.'

131
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Soon the train came to a stop and Hiro 
followed the woman off on to the platform.

132
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,640
Immediately after they'd said goodbye,  

133
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,360
she called loudly to a tired-looking man 
waiting at the bottom of a staircase.

134
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,000
The man hurried over to her, then followed 
her up the stairs, carrying all her bags.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,560
Hiro made his way to Platform 2.

136
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,120
He had half an hour to wait for his 
next train and, for some reason,  

137
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
sitting on the station made him feel lonely again.

138
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,960
As soon as the train arrived, he climbed in.

139
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,880
He found an empty seat, then sat looking out 
at the crowd of people outside the window.

140
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,040
Hiro noticed an attractive blonde girl 
with a big blue bag getting on the train.

141
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,600
He wondered if the girl might come 
and sit in the seat opposite him.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,120
But after taking a few steps towards 
him, she chose a seat three rows away.

143
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,040
Hiro was disappointed.

144
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,960
Then a man with silvery-grey hair, 
wearing a grey raincoat got on.

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,480
He was pulling a small suitcase on wheels.

146
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,440
Hiro watched him come closer.

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,760
He stopped some way down the train 
and spoke to one of the people there,  

148
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,240
giving a wide toothy smile.

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
Hiro didn't like the look of the man.

150
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,480
There was something about his smile,  

151
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,640
his grey clothes and the silent way he 
moved, which reminded Hiro of a shark.

152
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,000
The man came down the train towards him.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hiro hoped the man would walk past.

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
But he didn't.

155
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,760
'Excuse me,' the man said in 
English, giving the same smile.

156
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,960
'Is anyone sitting here?'

157
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,160
Hiro had no choice.

158
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,800
As well as the seat beside him, 
the two opposite were free.

159
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,320
'No,' he said, 'of course...'

160
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,640
'Thank you so much,' the man answered.

161
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,520
The man pushed his suitcase under the 
seat, then sat down opposite Hiro.

162
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,240
Hiro felt uncomfortable.

163
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,040
The man's eyes seemed very 
small and his teeth very sharp.

164
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,600
Hiro was reminded of a shark once again.

165
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,560
He imagined the man swimming 
towards him and smiling.

166
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,360
The smile made Hiro feel very cold, as if an 
icy hand had touched the back of his neck.

167
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,600
He watched as the man took off his grey raincoat,  

168
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,080
took a mobile phone from the coat pocket 
and put the phone on the table between them.

169
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,880
Hiro noticed the man's hands.

170
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,840
They looked terribly clean 
and the fingernails perfect.

171
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,200
Hiro wondered if the man might be a dentist.

172
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,120
The train pulled out of the station.

173
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,520
Hiro tried to look away from the man and read his 
book again, but something kept making him look up.

174
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,360
The man had taken a newspaper from his 
case and put on a pair of glasses now.

175
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,840
He looked quite strong, but with his grey hair,  

176
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,720
Hiro guessed he must be in his 
mid-sixties, even seventy perhaps.

177
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,120
After a while, the man put down the 
newspaper and checked his phone.

178
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,240
He did everything very carefully, holding the 
phone at a distance, and looking at the screen.

179
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,000
His fingers moved lightly over the keys.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,040
After a couple of minutes, the 
man put the phone on to the table,  

181
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,600
sat back in his seat and closed his eyes.

182
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,640
Hiro suddenly felt much calmer.

183
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,960
The man had made him nervous.

184
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,920
It was like being near a dangerous animal.

185
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,720
'Yes,' Hiro decided, 'he's 
not a man; he's a shark.'

186
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,640
Hiro relaxed and read his book.

187
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,040
The train was soon racing along 
again and his book was very exciting.

188
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,920
The next time he checked his 
watch it was after four o'clock.

189
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,920
He looked at the man opposite.

190
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,160
'Good, the Shark is still sleeping,' he thought.

191
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,040
Hiro got out his guidebook and tried to 
decide what to do when he reached Berlin.

192
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,280
He had booked a room in a cheap hotel, the 
Hotel Alma, in an area called Kreuzberg.

193
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,760
But how would he get there?

194
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:08,960
There seemed to be an underground train called the 
U-Bahn, but also an overground one, the S-Bahn.

195
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,200
Which one should he use?

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,520
All of a sudden, the train braked sharply 
and a number of things happened at once.

197
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,360
The braking was so hard that 
a woman walking down the train  

198
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,680
fell across the table between Hiro and the Shark.

199
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,600
As she fell, she knocked the Shark's newspaper  

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,720
and phone off the table and 
on to the seat beside Hiro.

201
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,400
At the same moment the Shark 
jumped up and his hand shot out.

202
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,560
But instead of helping the woman, he reached out 
across the table to try to get his things back.

203
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,480
Hiro was very surprised.

204
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,880
The Shark couldn't reach his things but, after 
a moment, he became quite pleasant again.

205
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Speaking in German, he took the 
woman's arm and helped her up.

206
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,200
A conversation followed, then the woman went away.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,960
The Shark sat down again.

208
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Almost immediately, he said,

209
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,480
'You have my mobile phone, I believe.'

210
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,520
Hiro didn't understand for a moment.

211
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,680
Then he looked down at the seat beside 
him and saw the man's phone on his jacket.

212
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,960
Hiro was surprised because he 
thought he'd put his own phone there.

213
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,040
He picked up the phone and passed it across.

214
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,960
'I'm sorry,' he said.

215
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,240
'That's all right,' the 
Shark said, taking the phone.

216
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,640
As he did so, their hands touched.

217
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,760
The Shark's hand felt cold.

218
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,840
'These trains are so dangerous,' he went on.

219
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,120
'They are too fast!

220
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,120
I am always nervous travelling in this country.'

221
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,040
'Yes,' Hiro answered.

222
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,680
'Will you excuse me for a moment?' the man said.

223
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,920
'Please be so kind to keep my seat for me.'

224
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,280
Without waiting for an answer, he picked up his 
phone and walked up the train to the toilet.

225
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Hiro watched the Shark close the toilet door, 
then saw the light above the door come on.

226
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,040
For a moment nothing happened, then Hiro heard the  

227
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,760
small ringing sound his phone made 
when a text message came through.

228
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,320
He looked down.

229
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,360
Under his jacket, he found his phone.

230
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,000
So, it was there after all.

231
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
His heart gave a tiny jump.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Could it be a text from Akiko?

233
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,920
He picked up the phone and 
pressed a key to open the message.

234
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,520
For a second or two he didn't understand.

235
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,560
He could understand the 
English, but not what it meant.

236
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
He read it twice.

237
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,960
MEET BRANDENBURG GATE 1 PM TOMORROW.

238
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,160
COLLECT EQUIPMENT AND HALF FEE.

239
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:24,520
It was another two or three seconds before Hiro 
realised the phone wasn't his.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

240
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
CHAPTER THREE

241
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,840
An amusing mistake

242
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,320
Hiro stared at the phone.

243
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,920
Of course, he understood what had happened now 
- the Shark's phone was a Nokia just like his.

244
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,760
In his excitement to check the message,  

245
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,720
Hiro hadn't noticed there was no 
screensaver, no photo of his dog.

246
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,280
Well, it was a simple mistake and 
there was nothing to feel guilty about.

247
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,360
When the Shark returned from the toilet, 
Hiro would hand back the phone and apologise.

248
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,120
The message didn't seem that private.

249
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,400
Hiro knew the Brandenburg Gate was one 
of the most famous sights in Berlin.

250
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,640
So, the man was meeting someone there.

251
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,520
He was going to collect some 
equipment and half his fee.

252
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Surely there wasn't anything 
very private about that?

253
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,360
Hiro put the phone down and looked up.

254
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,760
He wondered if the Shark had checked Hiro's 
phone and discovered the mistake, too.

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,680
The light was still on above the toilet door.

256
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Perhaps even at this moment the 
Shark was reading one of the love  

257
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,640
messages Akiko had sent Hiro before their breakup.

258
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,080
Hiro had saved seven or eight of them.

259
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,480
Hiro read the message on 
the Shark's phone once more.

260
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,720
Perhaps it was the result of the book 
he was reading with all its murders,  

261
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,640
but the more Hiro looked at the 
message, the more uncomfortable he felt.

262
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,200
There seemed to be something odd about 
it, something that wasn't quite right.

263
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,680
He paused for a second, then 
did something really stupid.

264
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,440
He knew it was stupid even before 
he did it, but it was just so easy.

265
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,400
He pressed the Inbox key on the Shark's 
phone, and found the message list.

266
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,720
The first message on the list - the one he'd 
just read - was from someone called 'M'.

267
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,160
Hiro picked the next message.

268
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,160
It was also from 'M'.

269
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,960
Hiro looked up once more.

270
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,000
It was safe: the toilet light was still on.

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
He opened the message.

272
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,280
The little screen filled immediately.

273
00:19:52,280 --> 00:20:00,440
BERLIN ASSIGNMENT HOTEL ADLON 
ROOM 319 TUESDAY AFTER 8PM.

274
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,720
HALF FEE AT MEETING, HALF ON COMPLETION.

275
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,640
Hiro wasn't sure he understood.

276
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
His heart was beating fast.

277
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:19,040
Part of the message was obvious: tomorrow was 
Tuesday and the Hotel Adlon must be in Berlin.

278
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,600
He knew what a fee was, too: money 
that is paid for doing something.

279
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,120
But what about the rest?

280
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,600
Wasn't assignment' another word for 'job'?

281
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,560
The word sounded a little bit odd.

282
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Wasn't 'assignment' a word a writer 
would use in a thriller to mean ...?

283
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,840
No, that was a crazy thought!

284
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,200
'It must be the effect of that silly 
book I'm reading,' Hiro said to himself.

285
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,680
The next moment his heart stopped.

286
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,120
When he looked up, the light 
above the toilet had gone out.

287
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,320
Not only that, but the door was 
opening and the Shark was coming out.

288
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,120
The old man was already making 
his way back towards him.

289
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Hiro had to act fast.

290
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,800
He closed the message, then dropped the 
phone back on to the seat beside him.

291
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,560
Now he could relax: the Shark would never 
know Hiro had been reading the messages.

292
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Hiro watched the man come up.

293
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,520
A second later, Hiro realised his mistake.

294
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,200
Of course the Shark would know!

295
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,400
The last message had been received while he 
was in the toilet and Hiro had opened it then.

296
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,480
It wouldn't show as a 'New Message' 
now, but as one that had been 'Read'.

297
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
Hiro picked up the phone 
just as the Shark arrived.

298
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,560
Even before he sat down, the Shark spoke.

299
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:04,320
'Ha, my friend!' he said with another toothy 
smile, 'I have just had a very amusing experience.

300
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,440
When I was in the toilet, I decided 
to check the messages on my phone.

301
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,800
But when I turned it on, I discovered-'

302
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,640
'I have your phone,' Hiro said quickly.

303
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,920
The Shark watched Hiro for a 
moment, then seemed to relax.

304
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Hiro had an odd feeling he'd spoken just in time.

305
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,720
'Yes,' he said, 'and I have yours.

306
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:40,480
Is this your girlfriend?' he 
went on, giving a short laugh.

307
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,000
'She is very beautiful.

308
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,480
What is her name?' The Shark held 
out Hiro's phone across the table.

309
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,600
The screensaver photo of Yuki was showing.

310
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,000
'Yuki,' Hiro answered.

311
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,640
The Shark gave a strange nod of his head.

312
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
A very beautiful dog.

313
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,960
How amusing that we have the 
same kind of Nokia phone!

314
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,480
Now perhaps you would return mine?'

315
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,360
Hiro was already holding the phone.

316
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,880
He held it out, trying to 
stop his hand from shaking.

317
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,800
'I'm very sorry,' he said.

318
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,440
'A message came through and I 
opened it before I realised...'

319
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,800
The Shark's eyes narrowed.

320
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,920
He watched Hiro for a moment.

321
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:42,920
'Of course you did; that is quite natural,' 
he said, then looked at his phone.

322
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,040
Hiro didn't move while the 
Shark opened the message.

323
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,320
Hiro saw him read it, then close it again.

324
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,040
'Yes, from a business colleague,' the Shark said.

325
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,000
There was silence for a moment or two.

326
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,680
Hiro didn't know what to say.

327
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,560
Then the Shark slowly nodded his head and smiled.

328
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:16,320
'So, since we know each other's great 
secrets, I think we must introduce ourselves.

329
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,520
My name is Erik Bjornson.

330
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,920
I am a businessman from Sweden.

331
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,360
And who, may I ask, do I have the 
pleasure to meet?'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

332
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,200
CHAPTER FOUR

333
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,440
A helping hand

334
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,360
Hiro felt hot.

335
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,000
The train seemed to be travelling even faster.

336
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,600
'My name's Hiro Adachi,' he said.

337
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,200
'I'm from Japan.'

338
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,000
'Yes, of course,' the Shark answered.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,320
'Japan is one of my favourite 
countries,' he went on.

340
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,840
As he spoke, he sat forward, 
held out his hand and smiled.

341
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,080
The smile seemed even more 
frightening than before.

342
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,280
'Pleased to meet you,' Hiro 
said, taking the man's hand.

343
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,360
It felt cold and wet, like the skin of a fish.

344
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,960
'The pleasure is mine,' the Shark replied.

345
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,320
'So, I suppose you are a 
student taking a holiday?'

346
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,480
'Yes, I'm InterRailing,' replied Hiro.

347
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,960
'Very good.

348
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,320
Berlin is your first stop?' the Shark asked.

349
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,520
'Yes,' said Hiro.

350
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,120
'And how many nights will you stay in Berlin?

351
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,440
It is a very exciting city,' the Shark continued.

352
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,320
'I'm not sure,' Hiro answered.

353
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,720
The Shark nodded slowly.

354
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,560
'You have already booked a hotel, of course?'

355
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,520
Hiro had an uncomfortable feeling that 
there was a reason for the questions.

356
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,920
He suddenly didn't want to tell 
the Shark where he was staying.

357
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,080
'Not yet.

358
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,840
I was going to look around,' he replied.

359
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,440
The Shark's eyes became very small.

360
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,400
'In Kreuzberg maybe,' Hiro added quickly.

361
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,640
He wondered if that was 
enough information to give.

362
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,120
The Shark nodded.

363
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,040
'Perhaps I can suggest somewhere.

364
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,520
The Hotel Modena?

365
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,400
Cheap, but very comfortable.'

366
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,960
'Thank you so much.

367
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,760
Maybe I'll try it,' replied Hiro.

368
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,320
'I shall telephone for you.

369
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,680
The owner is an old friend,' the 
Shark said, reaching for his phone.

370
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,360
Hiro didn't know what to do.

371
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,600
'Thank you, but I'm hoping to 
meet someone in Kreuzberg...

372
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
a Japanese friend...

373
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,880
from my city,' he said weakly.

374
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,360
There was silence for a moment.

375
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,960
It was a lie and Hiro could see the Shark knew it.

376
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,120
Hiro felt very hot.

377
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,880
The Shark smiled.

378
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
'Of course.

379
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,480
It was simply an idea.'

380
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,880
He watched Hiro thoughtfully for 
a few moments, then spoke again.

381
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,560
'I must apologise to you, my friend.

382
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,480
There is something terrible I must tell you.

383
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,280
I am a very stupid old man.

384
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,320
I read some messages on your phone 
before I understood it was not mine.

385
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:02,560
I imagine you did the same?' Hiro felt 
a drop of sweat run out of his hair.

386
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,960
The lights in the train 
suddenly seemed very bright.

387
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,000
'No,' he said.

388
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
'Only one.

389
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,160
About your meeting at the Brandenburg Gate.'

390
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,880
There was a long silence again.

391
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,200
Hiro wanted to brush the sweat from his forehead.

392
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,880
The silence seemed to go on forever.

393
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,315
Finally, the man gave another 
smile and looked away.

394
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:32,320
* * *

395
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
At Hannover the train was 
delayed for half an hour,  

396
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,800
so it was after seven thirty 
when they reached Berlin.

397
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:46,920
It was a rainy evening and already getting dark, 
so the lights of the city shone all around.

398
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,640
Hiro felt more relaxed.

399
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,240
For the rest of the journey the Shark had 
slept - well, he'd had his eyes closed.

400
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,040
Hiro couldn't be certain he was asleep.

401
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,400
Hiro felt silly now for thinking 
so badly of the old man.

402
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,920
Obviously, Hiro's imagination had 
gone wild after reading that thriller.

403
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,040
After all, the man was old enough to  

404
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:18,320
be his grandfather - how could 
anyone like that be dangerous?

405
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,520
Finally they pulled into the 
station, a huge modern building.

406
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,800
Hiro picked up his bag and stood up.

407
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:33,560
Although he felt better, he wanted to get 
away from the old man as quickly as possible.

408
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,560
'It was very nice to meet 
you,' Hiro said politely.

409
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,640
The Shark also got up.

410
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,160
'How will you get to Kreuzberg?' he asked.

411
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,920
'I'm going to take the U-Bahn,' Hiro said.

412
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,440
'No, no, that is not good.

413
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,920
I shall show you the best way.'

414
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,080
Hiro's heart raced.

415
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,280
'It's very kind of you, but I'll be fine.'

416
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,080
The Shark took Hiro's arm.

417
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,760
'It is no problem.'

418
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,440
Hiro felt the Shark's hand lead 
him forward, off the train.

419
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,720
The platform was busy, but 
Hiro suddenly felt very alone.

420
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Even though he'd persuaded himself that his 
fears were just the result of a stupid book,  

421
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,840
Hiro realised he was shaking a little.

422
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,680
Here he was in a foreign city, 
where he didn't speak the language,  

423
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,760
and this old man was making him afraid.

424
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,560
'Follow me,' the Shark said.

425
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:48,280
'I will take you to the S-Bahn, to the 
correct platform, then leave you there.'

426
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,800
Hiro knew he couldn't argue.

427
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,640
He tried to keep calm.

428
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,280
'This will be all right,' he told himself.

429
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,680
'In five minutes I'll be on my own again.'

430
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:08,960
The Shark led the way along the platform 
until they came to an escalator going down.

431
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,720
'You must take the S-Bahn to 
Friedrichstrasse,' he said as  

432
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,960
they stepped together on to the moving escalator.

433
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,720
'It is the next stop.

434
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,600
Then you will take the U-Bahn 
to Hallesches Tor in Kreuzberg.

435
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,920
Do you understand?'

436
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:35,240
The Shark's face was close to Hiro's; his 
teeth were bright in the station lights.

437
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,040
'Thank you.

438
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,920
Yes,' Hiro replied.

439
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,400
They walked across a wide hall.

440
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,960
A family of Japanese were 
standing under a big clock.

441
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,560
Hiro thought of calling out to them for 
help, but couldn't think what to say.

442
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,840
A moment later he had passed them 
and it was too late in any case.

443
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,200
They reached another escalator.

444
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,560
This time they went up.

445
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,200
The Shark didn't speak.

446
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,360
Hiro told himself, 'Only another 
couple of minutes, then I'll be safe.'

447
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,400
They came out on to another platform.

448
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,000
It was wide, but quite crowded near the escalator.

449
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,080
'Come, there is more room 
further down,' the Shark said.

450
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,120
'I'll be fine now, thank you,' Hiro said.

451
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,600
'No, I shall wait,' the Shark answered.

452
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,360
'I must be sure you take the correct train.'

453
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,080
They stopped two thirds of 
the way along the platform.

454
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,040
It was less wide just there 
because of a large seat.

455
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,560
They were standing quite close to the edge.

456
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,320
The sound of a train made Hiro turn around.

457
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,160
It was coming in fast.

458
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,560
He saw the lights on the 
front, the driver looking out.

459
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,280
Hiro felt the Shark move in closer to him.

460
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,200
The next moment Hiro had a 
sudden idea of what might happen.

461
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,560
Everyone on the platform was 
looking forward, watching the train.

462
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,920
No one was looking in their direction.

463
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,080
The Shark was going to push him.

464
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
He was going to push him off the 
platform in front of the train!

465
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,240
At the last second Hiro moved back 
from the edge of the platform.

466
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,640
At the same time the Shark seemed 
to reach out as if he was falling.

467
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,040
Hiro felt the Shark take his arm, but 
Hiro was now away from the danger.

468
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,480
The next moment the train had raced past.

469
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,600
The scream of brakes followed.

470
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:04,520
A few seconds later the train 
had come to a stop.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

471
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,360
CHAPTER FIVE

472
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,680
A difficult decision

473
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,560
'Please!

474
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,960
You frightened me!

475
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,200
You nearly fell!' the Shark said.

476
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,880
Hiro stared in fear, unable to speak.

477
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:26,880
The old man's face was close to Hiro's 
and he was holding his arm very tightly.

478
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,320
'You must not stand so close to the edge 
of the platform!' the Shark went on.

479
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,920
'But this is your train.

480
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:42,480
Climb in quickly!' He moved even closer to Hiro.

481
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,360
'Take great care, young man.

482
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:52,120
Leave Berlin alive - not in a coffin!'

483
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,640
Their eyes met for a second, then 
Hiro felt the Shark give him a push.

484
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:07,120
A moment later Hiro found himself inside the 
train, the electric doors closing behind him.

485
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,320
Almost immediately the train 
began to pull out of the station.

486
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,480
Hiro couldn't move.

487
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,800
He stood in the doorway, looking at 
the Shark outside on the platform.

488
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,280
The old man didn't move either, but watched 
Hiro all the time as the train pulled away.

489
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,800
Then the train left the bright lights of the 
station and the Shark disappeared from view.

490
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,280
At last Hiro was alone.

491
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,800
Without thinking, he fell into a seat.

492
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,720
Suddenly he realised he was wet with sweat.

493
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,560
He undid his jacket.

494
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,760
Was he dreaming or had the 
Shark really tried to kill him?

495
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,640
It seemed a completely crazy idea, but Hiro 
couldn't think of any other explanation.

496
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,120
The Shark had led him to the edge of the platform,  

497
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,720
he'd moved behind Hiro, then 
reached out and caught his arm.

498
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,000
And what was that final thing he'd said?

499
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,880
'Leave Berlin alive - not in a coffin!' Wasn't a 
coffin the wooden box they use for dead bodies?

500
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,560
Hiro suddenly felt very cold.

501
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,760
He stared out through the 
train window at the city,  

502
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:40,200
but saw nothing except the Shark's 
cold grey eyes looking back at him.

503
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,840
How he reached his hotel 
that night, Hiro never knew.

504
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,480
It was like a terrible dream.

505
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,200
When he thought about it later, he 
had a memory of getting off the train  

506
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,520
at Friedrichstrasse and following a group 
of other travellers down into the U-Bahn.

507
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,440
He couldn't remember anything of that 
underground journey except hearing  

508
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,880
'Hallesches Tor!' After that he somehow made 
his way through the streets in the darkness,  

509
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,080
following the map in his guidebook.

510
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,200
But he remembered the little old man, Herr Albert,  

511
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,320
who opened the door of the Hotel 
Alma when Hiro pressed the bell.

512
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,240
Herr Albert had taken Hiro up to the second floor 
in an old lift with metal gates and wooden doors.

513
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:39,280
That evening the hotel seemed like a second home 
to Hiro and Herr Albert like a second father.

514
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,995
Hiro fell into bed and was 
asleep only a few seconds later.

515
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:47,000
* * *

516
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,320
When Hiro woke the next morning, 
everything came back to him immediately.

517
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,840
There seemed to be no escape from the awful dream.

518
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,760
The moment he opened his eyes it felt 
as if the Shark was standing next to  

519
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:12,680
the bed and whispering, 'Leave 
Berlin alive - not in a coffin!'

520
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,880
Hiro's first idea was to catch the 
earliest train out of the city.

521
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,840
He would go directly to Prague,  

522
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,800
or maybe Warsaw or Amsterdam - anywhere 
as long as he could get out of Berlin.

523
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,120
But then, as Hiro lay in bed 
looking up at the ceiling,  

524
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:39,080
thinking about what had happened on 
the platform, he started to feel angry.

525
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,560
'Why should an old man make 
me run off?' he thought.

526
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,240
Hiro began to wonder why he'd been so afraid.

527
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,120
Perhaps it was because he was 
safe inside his hotel room,  

528
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,840
but Hiro thought he should 
teach the Shark a lesson.

529
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,040
He would show him who was boss!

530
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,120
Hiro felt confused, but the longer 
he lay there, the angrier he became.

531
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,640
If the Shark had really tried to push 
him off the platform, then that was...

532
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,840
Hiro sat up, his blood boiling.

533
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,560
Who was this man who called himself Erik Bjornson?

534
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,120
If he had really wanted to kill Hiro,  

535
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,280
it must be because of the messages 
Hiro had read on his phone.

536
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:38,640
There was one idea that Hiro couldn't get 
out of his mind - the Shark was a killer.

537
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,760
And the messages meant that he was 
planning to kill someone that night.

538
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,800
Hiro had to do something.

539
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,640
But what?

540
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,120
He thought about Akiko.

541
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,000
She always knew what to do.

542
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,800
For a moment he considered phoning 
her, but then he stopped himself.

543
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,160
No, when Akiko had said she didn't 
want to hear from him, he'd replied,  

544
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,880
'Don't worry, you won't!' 
He wouldn't be the weak one.

545
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,800
If she decided to phone him, 
well, that was different.

546
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:25,480
Hiro jumped up from the bed, angry that 
he'd even considered the idea for a second.

547
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,880
When Hiro went into breakfast, Herr Albert gave 
him a friendly wave and took him to a table.

548
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,120
At one table a young American couple were 
discussing a boat trip on the Wannsee.

549
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,920
Hiro ate some cereal, thinking how good it would 
be to have such an uncomplicated stay in the city.

550
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,400
All of a sudden he realised that 
Herr Albert was at his shoulder.

551
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,240
'You would like an egg?' Herr 
Albert was asking softly.

552
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,440
'I'm sorry,' Hiro answered.

553
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:07,080
'No, no egg, thank you,' Then, without 
knowing he was about to say it,  

554
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:17,480
he went on, 'Could you tell me where the 
nearest police station is?'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

555
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,520
CHAPTER SIX

556
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,360
A visit to the police station

557
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,480
Half an hour later, Hiro was outside 
the police station at Hallesches Tor.

558
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,360
Looking up at the building he felt 
his new confidence suddenly leave him.

559
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:44,160
It was a huge grey place with very few windows 
and, standing there, Hiro began to feel nervous.

560
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,400
He thought about the lie he had told Herr  

561
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,360
Albert - that his camera had been 
stolen and he wanted to report it.

562
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,520
How he wished that was true.

563
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,280
How he wished that he had never met the Shark  

564
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,640
and that all he had to worry 
about was a missing camera.

565
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,600
Suddenly it seemed like a big 
mistake to come to the police.

566
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:15,240
He wasn't even certain any more that 
the Shark had tried to kill him.

567
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,240
From the start it didn't go well.

568
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,840
The first police officer he spoke to 
could understand very little English,  

569
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,360
and immediately called for someone else.

570
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,000
Hiro waited nervously for half an hour in the 
crowded waiting room, watching people come and go.

571
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,440
At last, a woman police officer in a 
bright green and white uniform appeared.

572
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,600
She introduced herself as Petra Muller,  

573
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:50,760
and led Hiro off to a small glass-walled 
office at the back of the police station.

574
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,800
Hiro began badly.

575
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,120
'I think an old man tried to kill me,' he said.

576
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,640
At that, the police officer raised her eyebrows.

577
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,600
'I read some messages on this man's phone.

578
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,560
I think he's going to murder someone 
tonight in the Hotel Adlon,' Hiro continued.

579
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,760
And then he tried to push me off 
the platform in front of a train.'

580
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,280
The words came falling out of Hiro's mouth.

581
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,920
Within half a minute, he was in a terrible mess.

582
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,320
'All right,' the police officer said quietly.

583
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,880
'Perhaps we should take this a bit more slowly.'

584
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,920
Hiro had to repeat himself while the 
police officer took several pages of notes.

585
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,080
Then she finally stood up and told 
Hiro she was going to get someone else.

586
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,080
It was half an hour before she reappeared,  

587
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:55,440
this time with an older man, who was 
fat and smelt strongly of cigarettes.

588
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,240
He wasn't wearing a uniform and 
Hiro decided he must be a detective.

589
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,800
The detective didn't introduce himself.

590
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,160
He sat on the table and crossed his arms.

591
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:15,400
'So, you're the Japanese boy who thinks 
an old man has tried to kill him.

592
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,720
Is that correct?' the detective started.

593
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,760
Hiro didn't know how to answer.

594
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,040
'Is that correct?' the detective repeated.

595
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,920
'Yes, that's right,' Hiro said at last.

596
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:40,320
'And why do you believe this old man 
wished to murder you?' the detective asked.

597
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,800
Hiro felt more nervous all the time.

598
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,320
'I explained to your colleague that-'

599
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,040
'I don't wish to know what 
you explained to my colleague.

600
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,560
I want you to tell me!' 
the detective said angrily.

601
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,280
Hiro looked up at the detective.

602
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,840
He seemed to be in a very bad mood - as 
if he would start shouting at any moment.

603
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:13,360
'By accident I read some messages on 
the old man's phone,' Hiro said quietly.

604
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,360
'We were on the train and I 
picked up his phone by mistake.'

605
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:24,200
'Yes, yes, I know all that,' 
the detective said impatiently.

606
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:31,640
'What I want to know is why you believe an 
old man would wish to kill you for that!'

607
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,000
Hiro smelt cigarettes on the 
detective's breath again.

608
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,840
'I think the messages I read on the old man's 
phone were very important,' Hiro said quietly.

609
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,600
'One message said he had an 
assignment at the Hotel Adlon.'

610
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,480
The detective's eyes lit up.

611
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,480
'Ah, an assignment!

612
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,680
He smiled at the woman police officer.

613
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,000
'I'm sorry.

614
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,680
Go on.'

615
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,720
Hiro felt hot.

616
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,400
'And the other message said he was going to 
collect half his fee and some equipment today at-'

617
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,520
'Equipment, eh!' the dzetective broke in.

618
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,120
'And what do you think is meant by that?'

619
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,200
'I'm not sure,' Hiro said nervously.

620
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,080
'I thought...'

621
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,760
Hiro came to a stop.

622
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,480
'Well?' the detective said.

623
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,680
'I'm not sure,' Hiro answered.

624
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,360
'I thought it might be a gun,' he 
said at last, dropping his head.

625
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,160
There was silence.

626
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,080
Hiro could feel the detective's eyes on him.

627
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:54,320
Finally, the man got up from the table 
and began to walk round the room.

628
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,840
'OK, let's leave all that for the moment.

629
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,920
Now, you say he tried to kill you.

630
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,640
How exactly did he do that?'

631
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,720
'We were on the platform at the 
main station,' Hiro explained.

632
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,200
'He was standing behind me.

633
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,040
I think he was going to push me.'

634
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,280
'You think he was going to push you.'

635
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,880
The detective said the words slowly.

636
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,080
'Yes, and he got hold of my arm,' Hiro went on.

637
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:38,040
'And he got hold of your arm,' 
the detective repeated after him.

638
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,160
There was silence.

639
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,160
Hiro felt his face going red.

640
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,920
Now that he'd said out loud what he 
believed, it suddenly seemed very stupid.

641
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,680
He saw the detective watching him.

642
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,840
The man just gave a tired nod.

643
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,040
Then he spoke.

644
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,280
'I guess you like spy films, yes?

645
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,800
James Bond, Jason Bourne, this sort of rubbish?'

646
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,920
Hiro didn't look up.

647
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,560
'You know, I suppose, that 
it's a very serious business  

648
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,960
to waste police time,' the detective went on.

649
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,520
'Yes, I do,' Hiro answered.

650
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,760
'And you can imagine how busy 
we are,' the detective said.

651
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,760
Hiro nodded.

652
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,480
There was silence again.

653
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
The detective went on at last.

654
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,600
'What are you doing here in Berlin alone?'

655
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,760
'I'm on an InterRail trip,' Hiro replied.

656
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,680
'I know.

657
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,200
But why are you by yourself?

658
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,280
Where are your friends?' the detective asked.

659
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,320
'I...

660
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,880
I was going to have a holiday 
with my girlfriend, but...

661
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:01,120
we've just broken up,' Hiro said quietly.

662
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,400
'Ah!

663
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,520
So now we have it.

664
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:11,920
A broken heart!' The detective shook 
his head and walked over to the door.

665
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,440
'Look, my friend,' he said, 
'Nobody is trying to kill you,  

666
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,160
and there aren't going to be any 
murders in the Hotel Adlon tonight.

667
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,280
You're living in a dream.

668
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,800
You see one thing and you imagine another.

669
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,160
It's all in your mind.

670
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:37,920
Now, return to your hotel, pack your bags and 
get a train back to England as fast as you can.

671
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,040
Buy your girlfriend some 
flowers, that's my advice.'

672
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,720
With that, he hurried out of the door,  

673
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,720
calling some orders in German to the 
woman police officer as he left the room.

674
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,600
Hiro looked down at the floor.

675
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:04,800
He had never before felt so small.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

676
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,920
CHAPTER SEVEN

677
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,160
Painful thoughts

678
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,720
When Hiro got back to his hotel,  

679
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:19,120
he went to his room, lay down on the 
bed and didn't move for a long time.

680
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,320
He felt terrible.

681
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,960
The police hadn't believed him.

682
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,760
Worse than that, they'd made 
him feel like a schoolboy again,  

683
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:34,800
a schoolboy who dreamt of spy stories 
and cried over the girlfriend he'd lost.

684
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,320
The visit to the police station made him remember  

685
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,040
something that had happened 
when he was about thirteen.

686
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,160
It wasn't a happy memory.

687
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,720
One very snowy day on his way to school, Hiro 
saw a man breaking the side window of a car.

688
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,920
The man got in and drove off.

689
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,000
Hiro quickly wrote down the number 
of the car, then called 110,  

690
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,320
the emergency number of the police.

691
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:10,000
All day Hiro felt very proud of what he'd 
done and told all his school friends.

692
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But that evening Hiro's father 
took a call from the police.

693
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,240
The man who had 'stolen' the car was its owner.

694
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:26,320
The locks on the car had frozen and 
he'd needed his car in an emergency.

695
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:33,000
Hiro felt very stupid and never told 
any of his friends the end of the story.

696
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,600
Now he had the same feeling.

697
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:42,040
What had the detective said about 
seeing one thing and imagining another?

698
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,400
Hiro wouldn't tell anyone about his visit to the  

699
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,360
police that morning and he would 
never again ask them for help.

700
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,520
After half an hour of such thoughts, 
Hiro suddenly jumped up from the bed.

701
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:03,360
Lying there like that, reliving the past 
and feeling sorry for himself, was weak.

702
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:10,640
That was schoolboy behaviour - just like keeping 
all those love messages from Akiko on his phone.

703
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:17,960
Immediately, he picked up his phone, went to 
Akiko's texts, and prepared to delete them.

704
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,680
His hand shook for a second or two.

705
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,000
'Delete all messages?' appeared on the screen.

706
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,200
With a little cry of pain, 
he pressed the 'OK' key.

707
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,560
After that, Hiro put on his jacket 
and hurried out of his room,  

708
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:41,920
almost knocking over Herr Albert, 
who was cleaning the corridor.

709
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,320
He went down in the old wooden lift 
and quickly out into the street.

710
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:54,520
He had no idea where he was going or what he 
was going to do, but the sun was shining now.

711
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,280
He tried to tell himself he was happier.

712
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,880
He stopped in a small cafe a short way 
up the road, and asked for a green tea.

713
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,880
He took his cup and went to sit by the window.

714
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:16,440
Looking out, watching all the people 
passing, his head began to feel clearer.

715
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,640
He tried to decide what to do.

716
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:25,080
As he was on holiday, Hiro thought he 
really ought to do some sightseeing.

717
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,680
He took out his guidebook and started to read.

718
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:37,880
The very first place he found, on the first 
page of the guidebook, was the Brandenburg Gate.

719
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,560
Hiro stared at the picture.

720
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,760
The words seemed to jump out of the 
page at him: 'The Brandenburg Gate,  

721
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:56,440
Berlin's most famous sight, is in Pariser Platz, 
where the famous Hotel Adlon can also be found.'

722
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,840
The Brandenburg Gate...

723
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,120
the Hotel Adlon.

724
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,720
Hiro read the words again, 
then looked at his watch.

725
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,240
It was twelve o'clock.

726
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,120
In one hour the Shark would be at his meeting;  

727
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:19,160
he would collect the gun and 
get the first half of his fee.

728
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,440
Hiro had a sick feeling in his stomach.

729
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,160
His heart had started to beat very fast.

730
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,640
He closed his eyes.

731
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,520
When he opened them again, 
he knew what he must do.

732
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:40,600
He'd found the strength to delete Akiko's 
messages, now he had to be brave again.

733
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:46,400
If the police wouldn't go to the Brandenburg 
Gate, he would have to do it himself.

734
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,640
There was just time to get 
there before one o'clock.

735
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,800
Immediately, he pushed his tea 
away and hurried across the cafe.

736
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,920
He almost threw a five-euro 
note across the counter.

737
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,200
He didn't wait for any change.

738
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,120
There wasn't a moment to lose.

739
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:13,120
He found a U-Bahn station just round the corner 
and stopped at the map inside the entrance.

740
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,320
Which was the way to go?

741
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:22,520
He needed to get to Unter den Linden - that 
was the nearest stop to the Brandenburg Gate.

742
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,440
It seemed very complicated: 
he would have to travel up  

743
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,920
to Friedrichstrasse and then get a different line.

744
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,080
Remembering what his guidebook said,  

745
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:39,680
he hurried into a newspaper shop to buy a 
train ticket, then ran down to the platform.

746
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,360
At least he didn't have to wait long.

747
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,960
Soon a train arrived and he jumped in.

748
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:53,040
He went to stand against the opposite 
door, too nervous and excited to sit down.

749
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,520
The journey seemed endless, although 
it wasn't more than five stops.

750
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:05,560
Then he was running along the platform and up 
and down the stairs to get to the other line.

751
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,200
This time there was a longer wait.

752
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,920
He had just missed a train.

753
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:17,640
It was already 12.40 - only twenty 
minutes before the Shark's meeting.

754
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,480
Hiro walked up and down the platform.

755
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,080
At 12.45 the train appeared at last.

756
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,920
The moment it stopped Hiro opened 
the door and jumped inside.

757
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,280
It was only one stop now, 
three or four minutes, no more.

758
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,280
He tried to calm himself 
down, take some deep breaths.

759
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,520
The train pulled out of the station 
and raced into the darkness.

760
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:56,640
Surely now he must be there in time?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

761
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,640
CHAPTER EIGHT

762
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,760
A little bit of sightseeing

763
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:10,440
When Hiro came out of the underground station five 
minutes later, he found himself in a wide street.

764
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:16,440
Smart shops and hotels stretched away 
in both directions - and there was the  

765
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,800
Brandenburg Gate, a couple of hundred metres away.

766
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,960
Hiro saw the six columns of 
the great Greek-style gateway,  

767
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:34,480
just as he'd seen in the guidebook, and on its 
top, the horses and chariot against the sky.

768
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,760
Hiro made his way towards the Gate.

769
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,560
It was 12.50.

770
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,360
Now he had to take great care.

771
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:50,160
He would have to get close to the Gate if he 
wanted to see the Shark's meeting take place.

772
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,040
But he also had to make sure he kept out of sight.

773
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,440
He must make sure the Shark didn't see him.

774
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,880
At first there was no problem.

775
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:07,720
Cars were parked all the way up the 
street and Hiro kept close to these.

776
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,440
On the left- hand side he noticed 
the entrance to the Hotel Adlon,  

777
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,320
a grand building with a revolving door.

778
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:24,640
If Hiro was right, it was there that 
evening the Shark would complete his work.

779
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,400
Further up the street it became more difficult.

780
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,680
The street opened up into a 
wide square - the Pariser Platz.

781
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,600
Now Hiro could be seen more easily.

782
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:44,120
But there were plenty of cars here too, 
many of them very large, with dark windows.

783
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:49,800
He walked past these, getting 
closer all the time to the Gate.

784
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,120
Now he could see how big it was.

785
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,040
There were lots of people 
wandering about around the columns.

786
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,800
He didn't know what to do.

787
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,160
Perhaps the Shark would meet his 
friend on the other side of the Gate,  

788
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,680
where most of the tourists were.

789
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,840
But to get close was so dangerous!

790
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,600
It was 12.55.

791
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,960
If only he weren't so easy to notice.

792
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,440
If only he weren't Japanese!

793
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,040
A coach pulling up on the far 
side of the Gate caught his eye.

794
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,560
After a few moments, the passengers 
came pouring out of its door.

795
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,960
Hiro had an idea.

796
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,800
The tourists were all Europeans or Americans,  

797
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:46,600
but if he could get round to that side, a coach 
full of Japanese tourists was sure to appear soon.

798
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,080
He began to make his way round.

799
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,040
Hiro was nearly there, when just as he'd guessed, 
a coach pulled up by the side of the road.

800
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:05,120
Almost immediately thirty or forty Japanese 
tourists of all ages came hurrying down the steps.

801
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,320
Hiro went to join them.

802
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:14,400
The sound of his own language made him 
want to cry out, but he stopped himself.

803
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,920
He had to look out for the Shark.

804
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:25,080
Several of the group hurried forward, pulling 
cameras from cases, and Hiro moved with them.

805
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,680
As he got nearer the Gate his eyes 
searched the foot of the columns.

806
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,200
He couldn't see the Shark.

807
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
He looked at his watch.

808
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,800
It was exactly one o'clock.

809
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,600
Hiro studied the people round the Gate.

810
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:47,480
Several were wandering around, looking up 
at the columns or standing for photographs,  

811
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,160
but none of them looked anything like the Shark.

812
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,360
The only person over fifty years old was 
a priest, wearing long black clothes,  

813
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,040
standing away to the left.

814
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,560
Hiro felt disappointed.

815
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:08,080
After fighting his fears so 
bravely, was it all for nothing?

816
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,800
Hiro watched as the priest 
was joined by a second man.

817
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:19,360
The two of them went off behind one of 
the columns and disappeared from view.

818
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,680
Five minutes passed.

819
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,440
Hiro began to wonder if he'd made a mistake.

820
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,960
Should he go back to the other side of the Gate?

821
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,000
An old man walking with a stick came slowly past.

822
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,560
Hiro's heart missed a beat.

823
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,120
He couldn't see the man's face.

824
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,680
Was this the Shark, pretending to need a stick?

825
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,720
Hiro moved in order to see the 
man's face, but then stopped.

826
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,480
A little old woman, perhaps eighty 
years of age, had joined the old man.

827
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:02,120
Hiro shook his head and looked at his watch: 1.10.

828
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,800
Was the Shark really not coming?

829
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,400
Hiro began to consider the possibilities.

830
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,400
What if, following the mix-up with the phones,  

831
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,520
the Shark had changed the 
time or place of the meeting?

832
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,840
A hand on his shoulder made Hiro jump.

833
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,720
For a second he thought it must be the Shark.

834
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,960
Then he gave a sick laugh.

835
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:34,040
One of the Japanese women from the coach was 
smiling at him and holding out her camera.

836
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,560
She wanted Hiro to take a photo of her 
and her friend in front of the Gate,  

837
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,880
and she was speaking in Japanese.

838
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:50,040
Hiro felt stupid - he'd been in such a dream 
that he hadn't even recognised his own language.

839
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:56,280
He took the photo as asked, handed back 
the camera, and looked at his watch.

840
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,560
It was 1.20.

841
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,960
So, the Shark wasn't coming after all.

842
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,320
Hiro felt very stupid.

843
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,200
'Perhaps the detective at the police 
station was right,' he thought.

844
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,800
'Perhaps I should just take the 
first train back to England.'

845
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,920
He walked straight towards the Gate, no 
longer hiding among the Japanese tourists,  

846
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,480
and headed for the underground station.

847
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:31,840
He just wanted to get out of Berlin 
now, to get out of this stupid city.

848
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,600
Hiro was less than fifty metres 
from the underground station,  

849
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,400
when the sound of a car close 
behind him made him look round.

850
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,840
A black BMW with dark windows stopped beside him.

851
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:52,200
As it did so, the back window opened 
and a dark-haired man looked out.

852
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,720
'Mr Hiro Adachi?' the man asked in English.

853
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,320
He didn't wait for an answer.

854
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,360
'I'd like a word with you.

855
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:08,880
It's very important.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

856
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,600
CHAPTER NINE

857
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,440
The safe house

858
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,840
Hiro looked inside the car.

859
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,880
'Yes?' he said.

860
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,600
He was too surprised to say anything else.

861
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,200
'My name is Karl Meier,' the man went on.

862
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,960
He was very smartly dressed.

863
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,040
'I work for the Bundesnachrichtendienst.

864
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,680
The BND is a department of the German police.

865
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,360
Foreign intelligence.

866
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,640
We need to talk to you.

867
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,800
Get in, please.'

868
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,920
At the same moment the driver 
of the car climbed out.

869
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,120
His head was shaved and he 
wore a black leather jacket.

870
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,480
He looked very tough.

871
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,840
He opened the back door for Hiro.

872
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,280
Hiro felt his heart beat fast.

873
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,680
'Yes, of course,' he said.

874
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,760
He was feeling very nervous, 
not sure if he should get in,  

875
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,600
but the driver put his hand on Hiro's shoulder.

876
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,240
Hiro climbed into the car next to Karl Meier.

877
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:20,640
Almost immediately, the driver banged the door 
shut, got in the front and the car pulled away.

878
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,200
It had all happened so 
quickly, Hiro couldn't think.

879
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,640
'Don't worry, my friend,' Meier said.

880
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,640
'You're quite safe with us.'

881
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,680
He put out his hand.

882
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,160
'I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr Adachi.

883
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,520
You're a very brave young man.'

884
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,960
Hiro shook the man's hand.

885
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,760
The car had already left Unter den Linden 
and was racing through the streets.

886
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,200
Hiro saw the driver watching him in the mirror.

887
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,960
He had a long cut on his face.

888
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,600
'Where are we going?' Hiro asked Karl Meier.

889
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,520
'Just somewhere we can talk 
more quietly, Mr Adachi.'

890
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,240
The man gave a strange smile.

891
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,040
In the car mirror, Hiro saw the driver smile, too.

892
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,680
Hiro began to feel uncomfortable.

893
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,040
How could the police have known where he was?

894
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,320
He wished he hadn't got into the car now.

895
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,560
Why hadn't one of the men shown 
him a police card or something?

896
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,520
The car raced on.

897
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,600
No one spoke.

898
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,000
Hiro had no idea where they were.

899
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,320
At last Hiro managed to find his voice.

900
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:44,160
'How did you know where to 
find me?' he said with a cough.

901
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,880
Meier didn't look at him.

902
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,720
'We've been following you for 
some time,' he said quietly.

903
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,520
Hiro saw the driver smile once again.

904
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,520
'You mean since I went to the police 
station this morning?' Hiro asked.

905
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,960
Meier looked round at that.

906
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,520
He watched Hiro for a moment or 
two, then nodded very gently.

907
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,640
'Yes, that's right.

908
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,720
There are some things you said 
which we want to double-check.'

909
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,440
Hiro did his best to relax.

910
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,720
At least he had an explanation 
now for how they'd picked him up.

911
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:32,280
At last they turned into a small street and 
drove round to the back of a large building.

912
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,640
Hiro wasn't sure if it was offices or flats.

913
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,600
Then the car pulled over the pavement and 
went down into an underground car park.

914
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,120
The car headlights shone brightly in the darkness.

915
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,800
Hiro felt a little sick.

916
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,240
They came to a stop opposite a lift.

917
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,440
Immediately, the driver got out 
and told Hiro to follow him.

918
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:05,240
Hiro climbed out of the car and a 
moment later, Meier joined them.

919
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,800
'This is what we call a "safe house",' Meier said.

920
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,800
'We use it for interviews, among other things.

921
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,280
Naturally, we can't take most 
people to our head office.

922
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,160
Please follow me.'

923
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,440
Meier led the way over to the lift,  

924
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,440
pressed a button on the wall and 
the doors opened immediately.

925
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,480
The three of them went inside.

926
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,120
It was dirty and smelly.

927
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,200
An empty beer can was lying on the floor.

928
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,160
With a tired look, Meier kicked it away.

929
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,320
The lift went slowly up, then the doors opened.

930
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,000
When they stepped out there were 
two brown doors in front of them,  

931
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,720
a long corridor leading off to 
the right, and stairs up and down.

932
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,440
The driver took a key from his 
pocket, unlocked the door on the left,  

933
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,520
then Meier led the way inside.

934
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,480
Hiro relaxed a little when 
he saw it was a simple flat.

935
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,240
There was a bedroom and bathroom 
off to one side of the hall,  

936
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,800
a kitchen directly ahead 
and a lounge to the right.

937
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,280
They went into the lounge and 
Meier turned on the light.

938
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:21,760
There was very little furniture: a 
sofa and two armchairs, a coffee table,  

939
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,360
a TV, but it seemed no one lived there.

940
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,680
There were no pictures on the wall, and 
there was nothing very warm about the room.

941
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,960
Meier sat in one of the armchairs.

942
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,200
'Please have a seat,' he 
said pointing to the sofa.

943
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:44,560
'Would you like a coffee, perhaps?' he added.

944
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,480
'No, thank you,' Hiro answered.

945
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:54,000
Meier spoke quickly in German to the 
driver, who went off into the kitchen.

946
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,640
Hiro didn't like the feeling in the room.

947
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,800
It was cold and strange.

948
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,720
Meier seemed in a hurry to start.

949
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:09,240
'So, when you went to the police this 
morning, the ordinary police, that is-'

950
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,360
'I thought they hadn't 
believed me,' Hiro broke in.

951
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,400
Meier's eyes narrowed.

952
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,760
'Yes, you're right.

953
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,920
They're very stupid people.

954
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,000
The truth is that your report 
was picked up on our computer.

955
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,760
We acted immediately.'

956
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,480
'I see,' Hiro answered, a little uncertainly.

957
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,160
Meier looked uncomfortable.

958
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:40,000
'Right, now it's important that you tell me in 
your own words what you told the ordinary police.

959
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,680
You told them about the old 
man on the train, of course.

960
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,160
And what did you tell them about 
the messages that you read on  

961
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:54,520
his phone?' Meier was sitting forward 
now and looking very closely at Hiro.

962
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,640
Hiro didn't answer.

963
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,280
This is all wrong, he thought.

964
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,960
The men are wrong, the room is 
wrong, the questions are wrong.

965
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,320
He didn't know what to do.

966
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,400
'So?' said Meier impatiently.

967
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,240
Hiro looked at the man.

968
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,520
'I'm sorry.

969
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,080
Is there a toilet I could use, please?'

970
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,680
Meier looked annoyed for a 
moment, then seemed to relax.

971
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,560
'Yes, of course,' he said with a smile.

972
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,880
'I'll show you.'

973
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,600
'Thank you,' Hiro replied.

974
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,640
Meier led Hiro out of the room and 
opened the bathroom door for him.

975
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,000
Hiro went in and closed the door.

976
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,840
He heard Meier go off into the kitchen 
and start talking to the driver.

977
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,720
Hiro sat on the edge of the bath 
and put his head in his hands.

978
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,520
He had to think.

979
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,920
'These men aren't real policemen, or 
foreign intelligence,' he said to himself.

980
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,800
'They must be friends of the Shark.

981
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,760
Perhaps they followed me 
from the Brandenburg Gate.

982
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,280
Yes, that must be it!

983
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,760
Maybe the Shark had been at the Gate earlier.

984
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,920
He'd met these men there.

985
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,040
When they saw me they decided 
to follow me and pick me up.

986
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:25,360
So what are they going to do with me now?'

987
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,320
Hiro looked around.

988
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,360
He had to escape.

989
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,760
There was no way out of the 
bathroom except through the door.

990
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,480
What could he do?

991
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,960
He got up, went over to the door and listened.

992
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,960
He could hear Meier talking in German.

993
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,040
It sounded as though he 
had returned to the lounge.

994
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,000
Maybe he was talking on the phone.

995
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,120
Hiro's brain was racing.

996
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:57,040
He thought: 'They want to be sure what I know.'

997
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,600
That was why Meier was asking the 
questions and not the Shark - by  

998
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,320
pretending to be police they hoped 
to get more information from him.

999
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,600
If the Shark asked the questions, 
Hiro might refuse to talk.

1000
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,680
But once they'd heard everything, 
surely they would kill him.

1001
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:20,960
'It'll be a shot in the back of 
the head,' Hiro told himself.

1002
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,120
'Either that, or a fall from the window, perhaps.'

1003
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,520
There was no time to think about it any more.

1004
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,640
Hiro looked round the bathroom once more.

1005
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,640
Then he made a decision.

1006
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,400
He had one chance only.

1007
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,720
If he was going to escape it had to be now.

1008
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:50,320
He stood by the door.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1009
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,320
CHAPTER TEN

1010
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,120
Escape!

1011
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:01,520
Very carefully, Hiro opened the bathroom 
door and put his head out into the hall.

1012
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,400
He'd been right - Meier was back in the lounge.

1013
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,200
He was talking on his phone, 
looking down, deep in conversation.

1014
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,680
The driver was out of sight in the kitchen.

1015
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,000
Hiro took a deep breath.

1016
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,680
He had only a few seconds 
to get to the front door.

1017
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:24,080
He took off his shoes and 
quietly crossed the hall.

1018
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,800
Five steps only and he was at the front door.

1019
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,520
If the door was locked, he was finished...

1020
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,200
He was in luck.

1021
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:39,320
With a tiny sound, the door opened, 
then he was out into the main corridor.

1022
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,000
He ran straight to the stairs.

1023
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,160
He went down only three or four steps 
before he realised he was making a mistake.

1024
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,800
'No,' he thought, 'Once they realise I've gone,  

1025
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:57,000
they'll expect me to go down, 
so I must go up instead.'

1026
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,200
He turned and ran back up the steps two at a time.

1027
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,120
He'd just managed to reach 
the next floor when he heard  

1028
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:08,120
the men run out of the flat, shouting in German.

1029
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,440
He heard them stop outside the lift.

1030
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,320
Hiro could only guess what they were shouting,  

1031
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:19,280
but then he heard their footsteps 
hurrying down the stairs.

1032
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,400
So, what to do now?

1033
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,960
Hiro's heart was racing.

1034
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:31,360
In a short time the men would realise he hadn't 
gone down and they would fly back up the steps.

1035
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,040
A fire escape!

1036
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,480
There had to be a fire 
escape in a place like this.

1037
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,120
But where?

1038
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,960
He ran up two floors without 
stopping, still carrying his shoes.

1039
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:50,080
Then he was at the top - there were 
no more stairs, just another corridor.

1040
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,880
Far below he could hear the men shouting.

1041
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,080
Then silence.

1042
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,160
They were listening for him.

1043
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,960
Listening for his footsteps.

1044
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,400
Then Hiro heard one of them coming up.

1045
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,240
There was nothing for it.

1046
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,080
Hiro ran the length of the corridor.

1047
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,040
At the end of the corridor there was a door.

1048
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,040
He pushed and the door opened.

1049
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,120
Hiro found himself outside on a fire escape,  

1050
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,360
a metal staircase going down 
the outside of the building.

1051
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,920
Should he go down?

1052
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,080
He had no choice.

1053
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:32,920
At any moment the man coming up would 
look along the corridor and see him.

1054
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:38,320
Hiro went down a couple of steps, then 
heard a door opening somewhere below.

1055
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:44,880
He ran back up and watched as the driver came 
out on to the fire escape two floors below him.

1056
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,000
Hiro saw him look down, then, just 
as the man was about to look up,  

1057
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,800
Hiro pressed himself back against the wall.

1058
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,480
His heart was beating crazily.

1059
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,800
Surely the man would see him!

1060
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,080
Two or three seconds passed.

1061
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,720
Then Hiro heard the man shout 
back into the building before  

1062
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,600
he went inside and the door banged shut.

1063
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,640
Hiro took another deep breath.

1064
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,960
He was out of danger!

1065
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:21,640
Hiro was just about to start down the 
steps, when something stopped him again.

1066
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:26,480
Was it a tiny sound from below or something else?

1067
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,520
The memory of something from 
a film came back to him.

1068
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,520
It had been a trick!

1069
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,440
The driver's shout had been a trick to make 
Hiro think the way was safe - the man had  

1070
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:45,680
closed the door loudly, but he was still outside 
on the fire escape at that moment, looking up.

1071
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,880
Hiro didn't move.

1072
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,080
He closed his eyes.

1073
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,120
Akiko's face came to his mind.

1074
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,560
'Please help me,' he said softly.

1075
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:04,400
Ten long seconds passed, then 
there was a quiet call from below.

1076
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,040
After that the door closed again.

1077
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:13,520
This time Hiro knew the 
man had really gone inside.

1078
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,320
Hiro's legs were shaking as he 
made his way down the stairs.

1079
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,000
He didn't stop now or look around.

1080
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,800
The only thing he thought about 
was getting to the bottom.

1081
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:34,080
He almost fell once, but managed to stop himself, 
then in thirty seconds he was down on the ground.

1082
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,200
He found himself on a small 
path between buildings.

1083
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,720
One way led to the main street 
at the front of the building.

1084
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,920
He could see people walking past.

1085
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,440
That was the way to go.

1086
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,960
Hiro walked quickly towards the street.

1087
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,520
Just as he got there, he saw a bus 
pull up about ten metres down the road.

1088
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,400
He didn't stop to think, but ran towards it.

1089
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:05,160
He reached the bus just as the 
driver was about to close the doors.

1090
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:10,600
Hiro almost threw himself 
inside and fell on to a seat.

1091
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,480
As the bus pulled away,  

1092
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:17,200
Hiro saw Meier appear through the glass 
door of the building he'd just left.

1093
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:22,480
Hiro dropped his head from view, 
pretending to tie up his shoes.

1094
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:28,440
It was another couple of minutes before he was 
brave enough to raise his head and look around.

1095
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:35,000
When he did, he took out his phone 
and opened his photo of Akiko.

1096
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,400
'Arigato,' he whispered.

1097
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,760
'Thank you.'

1098
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:46,480
Then, under his breath, 'I'm so 
sorry I deleted your messages.

1099
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:54,120
It was a terrible mistake.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1100
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:54,640
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1101
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,680
The eye of the storm

1102
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:05,360
Ten minutes later the bus pulled into 
a huge modern square and stopped.

1103
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,120
Most of the passengers hurried off.

1104
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,920
Not wanting to be alone anywhere 
now, Hiro followed them.

1105
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:19,120
He felt safer where there were crowds of 
people, and this place was busy with shoppers.

1106
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,920
Even so, he couldn't stop himself 
looking back every ten seconds or so.

1107
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:30,640
Had Meier seen him take the bus 
and guessed where it was going?

1108
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:36,320
To one side of the square there was a wall 
where a number of people were sitting.

1109
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:42,280
There was a kebab-seller nearby and most of 
the people on the wall were eating snacks.

1110
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:48,680
They looked relaxed and cheerful, chatting 
and taking photographs of one another.

1111
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,560
Hiro went over and sat down in the middle of them.

1112
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,560
Being Japanese he knew he could be easily noticed,  

1113
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,600
but with so many people around 
surely he wasn't in danger?

1114
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:08,560
Once he'd sat down, Hiro realised 
how terribly tired he was.

1115
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:14,360
His first thought was to return to 
his hotel and just fall on the bed.

1116
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,960
It would be so wonderful 
to sleep again untroubled.

1117
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,600
He felt as though he'd been living 
in fear of his life for weeks.

1118
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,800
Was it really only twenty-four 
hours since he met the Shark?

1119
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,840
A cinema sign on the far side 
of the square caught Hire's eye.

1120
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,560
All of a sudden the idea 
of sitting in the darkness,  

1121
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,400
safe from the world for a couple 
of hours, seemed wonderful.

1122
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,520
It would be like the calm time 
in the middle of the storm.

1123
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,240
What did they call it - the eye?

1124
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:57,720
Without wasting another moment, he got up 
and hurried over to the cinema entrance.

1125
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:04,840
He couldn't stop himself from looking behind as 
he went, but no one appeared to be following him.

1126
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,400
When he arrived at the box office, 
he discovered he was in luck.

1127
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,360
A new thriller was about to start.

1128
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,920
He paid, bought a hotdog and 
went through to find a seat.

1129
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:23,880
Some advertisements were showing when 
he went in, but it was beautifully dark.

1130
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,760
Still worried that someone may be following 
him, he chose a seat right at the back.

1131
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,840
In that way, he thought, he 
could see everyone who entered.

1132
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,520
He sat down and immediately 
began eating the hotdog.

1133
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:47,160
He hadn't thought about food since breakfast 
and was surprised to find how hungry he was.

1134
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,080
Very soon the film started.

1135
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,040
Thankfully, it was in English and not German.

1136
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,000
All the same, it made Hiro feel exhausted;  

1137
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,520
everyone spoke very quickly and 
Hiro found it hard to follow.

1138
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,160
He started thinking about 
what had happened that day.

1139
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,640
He had to find the answers to some questions.

1140
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:18,720
Hiro was absolutely certain now that the 
Shark was an assassin - a professional killer.

1141
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:23,280
The old man had come to Berlin to kill someone.

1142
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:34,200
The text message had said, 'Berlin Assignment 
Hotel Adlon Room 319 Tuesday after 8pm',  

1143
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:42,440
so the murder was to take place that 
evening in Room 319 of the Hotel Adlon.

1144
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:48,920
He supposed the Shark had been at the 
Brandenburg Gate after all, probably with Meier.

1145
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,760
When they saw Hiro there, they'd 
decided Meier would follow him.

1146
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,320
They wanted to know if the police 
knew about the Hotel Adlon.

1147
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,800
If they did, then the Shark 
might have to cancel his plan.

1148
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,960
Yes, that must be it!

1149
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,040
So what about the murder?

1150
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,480
Would it still go ahead?

1151
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,000
And what should Hiro do?

1152
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,600
Hiro felt so tired thinking about all these 
questions and worrying about what to do.

1153
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,040
It seemed to him that the trip 
had become some kind of test.

1154
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:33,320
He remembered something his grandfather 
had said to him, shortly before he died.

1155
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,320
The old man was very ill and 
had only a few days to live,  

1156
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:41,280
so the whole family had come to say goodbye.

1157
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:47,960
Taking Hiro by the arm, the old man 
had pulled Hiro close to the bed.

1158
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:53,760
'Life is an examination, Hiro-chan,' he said.

1159
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,760
'Make me proud.'

1160
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,240
Those words rang in Hiro's ears now.

1161
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,440
Is this what the old man meant?

1162
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:11,040
Hiro shook his head, 
exhausted, and closed his eyes.

1163
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,240
The film music washed over 
him like waves on the beach.

1164
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:22,760
The next thing Hiro knew, a man in a white shirt 
and black tie had his arm on Hiro's shoulder.

1165
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,320
The man was shaking him hard.

1166
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:30,560
The man said something in German, 
then tried in English: 'Hey!

1167
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,120
No sleeping here!'

1168
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,600
Hiro shook his head.

1169
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,760
'What?' he said.

1170
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,560
He couldn't understand where he was.

1171
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,720
Then he remembered.

1172
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:50,080
'No sleeping!' The man in the 
white shirt was still shaking him.

1173
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,360
'Go to a hotel if you want to sleep!'

1174
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,960
Hiro pulled himself up.

1175
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,720
'I'm sorry.'

1176
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:05,720
The man gave an angry look, but moved 
away, collecting rubbish from the seats.

1177
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:10,520
Hiro looked at his watch: 5.45!

1178
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,080
He couldn't believe it.

1179
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:16,200
He must have slept through the rest of the film.

1180
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,160
He got to his feet.

1181
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:23,360
Then the full memory of the last 
twenty-four hours hit him: the Shark...

1182
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,120
the Brandenburg Gate...

1183
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:28,360
Meier and the safe house...

1184
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:38,760
Hiro fell back in the seat and put 
his hands to his head.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1185
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,640
CHAPTER TWELVE

1186
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,320
A voice in the ear

1187
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:48,000
It was almost six o'clock 
when Hiro left the cinema.

1188
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,040
There were dark clouds in the 
sky and all around the square the  

1189
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:56,840
lights from advertisements shone 
as brightly as if it were night.

1190
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,000
For a moment Hiro thought 
he could be back in Tokyo.

1191
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,240
It made him feel terribly homesick.

1192
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,600
But he wasn't at home.

1193
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,440
A sign above the cinema read: 'Alexanderplatz'.

1194
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,720
He looked at the map in his 
guidebook to see where he was.

1195
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,560
Alexanderplatz wasn't 
difficult to find on the map.

1196
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:26,520
He saw he wasn't very far from his hotel 
- only seven or eight stops on the U-Bahn.

1197
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:31,640
Without thinking, Hiro walked 
towards the U-Bahn entrance.

1198
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:36,720
He didn't have much idea what he was going 
to do when he got back to his hotel room.

1199
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:43,480
He supposed he was just going to lie on the bed 
and read or watch TV until he was able to sleep.

1200
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:46,880
Then he would leave Berlin the following morning.

1201
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,080
His trip seemed a failure, but he'd had enough.

1202
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:56,000
He felt frightened and tired and cold.

1203
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,160
Hadn't he done all he could?

1204
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:04,800
He'd been brave and put himself in danger - his 
grandfather couldn't be disappointed with him.

1205
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:11,680
Why shouldn't Hiro just quietly leave 
Berlin now and go somewhere else?

1206
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:15,400
Alexanderplatz station was big and busy.

1207
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,400
There seemed to be several lines,  

1208
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:24,120
both overground and underground - he 
checked the map again and chose U-Bahn 2.

1209
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,800
He would have to change trains once.

1210
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,600
He didn't have to wait long for a train.

1211
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,720
He climbed in and sat in the corner.

1212
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,200
The train was very full.

1213
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:44,240
Looking up and down he watched all the different 
men and women, old and young, rich and poor.

1214
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:50,800
Some were clearly on their way home from work, 
others were just starting out for the evening.

1215
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:56,760
He watched a couple of his age, talking 
closely together and sharing a quick kiss.

1216
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,200
How wonderful, he thought.

1217
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:04,680
How lovely it must be to have 
so few cares in the world.

1218
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,560
The stations hurried by one after another.

1219
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,880
Dreamily, Hiro watched the lively 
city passing before his eyes.

1220
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:21,840
It was only when they pulled into Potsdamer 
Platz that Hiro realised he'd missed his station.

1221
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,040
Looking at the map on the inside of the train  

1222
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:30,480
he saw that he had forgotten to get 
out earlier and change to U-Bahn 6.

1223
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,760
With a shake of his head, he 
jumped up and went to the door.

1224
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,080
Just before stepping out of the train, he stopped.

1225
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,560
'Why shouldn't I just continue 
the journey?' he thought.

1226
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,720
'I could go on to the end of 
the line and get the train back.

1227
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,880
It would at least kill some time.'

1228
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,720
With a smile he went back to his seat.

1229
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:00,560
The woman sitting in the 
next seat seemed surprised.

1230
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,840
The train pulled out.

1231
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,960
Hiro looked at his watch: 6.35.

1232
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,480
He tried to relax.

1233
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,440
Five minutes later he knew it was impossible.

1234
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,560
He couldn't sit still.

1235
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:22,520
He couldn't simply go back to his hotel and 
pretend he knew nothing of the Shark's plans.

1236
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,720
A voice was whispering in his ear.

1237
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:31,160
The voice had started the moment Hiro 
had decided to go back to his hotel room.

1238
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,640
'Coward!' it was saying.

1239
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,240
'You're not brave at all.

1240
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:39,360
You're being a coward!'

1241
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,160
With each station that passed 
the feeling grew worse.

1242
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,640
He looked at his watch again.

1243
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,600
It was 6.45 now.

1244
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:56,920
It hit him then - in about an hour's time it was 
quite possible that a murder would take place!

1245
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,840
Hiro began to feel very sick.

1246
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,280
He was the only person who 
knew about the Shark's plans.

1247
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:08,400
He was the only person who might stop them.

1248
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,600
He had to go back.

1249
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:14,440
He had to do something.

1250
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:23,920
When the train pulled into the next station, 
Hiro was already waiting at the door to go back.

1251
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:24,240
* * *

1252
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:29,000
It was 7.15 when Hiro reached Unter den Linden.

1253
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,360
While Hiro had been down in the 
underground it had started to rain outside.

1254
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:40,680
Cars drove past down the wide street, 
their wheels throwing up showers of water.

1255
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:45,640
Hiro buttoned up his jacket and 
set off for the Hotel Adlon.

1256
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:49,560
Beyond he could see the Brandenburg Gate.

1257
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,840
Now it was evening, the columns were 
lit with a strange golden light;  

1258
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:00,440
the whole place looked very 
foreign and frightening.

1259
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:05,600
When he arrived at the entrance of 
the Hotel Adlon, Hiro was nervous.

1260
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,560
A doorman stood outside the big revolving door.

1261
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,840
He was just moving forward with an umbrella  

1262
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,360
to welcome someone arriving 
in a large silver Mercedes.

1263
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,280
The woman who climbed out of 
the back of the Mercedes was  

1264
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:23,560
beautiful and dressed in very expensive clothes.

1265
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:29,280
Hiro stood to the side as she 
walked past him and into the hotel.

1266
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,000
As the revolving door turned around and around he  

1267
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,000
could see bright lights and a 
shiny floor inside the hotel.

1268
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,960
It was so grand - Hiro had never 
been in a hotel like it before.

1269
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:50,480
He took a deep breath and went 
through the revolving door himself.

1270
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:56,720
Over to one side there were several 
beautiful brown leather sofas and armchairs.

1271
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:01,080
A well-dressed young man was working 
at a laptop in one of the armchairs.

1272
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:06,200
On a sofa an older couple in 
evening clothes were chatting.

1273
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,360
Hiro went over to the reception desk.

1274
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:16,520
The receptionist, a smartly-dressed young man with 
glasses, looked very surprised when he saw Hiro.

1275
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,280
He spoke to him in German.

1276
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,480
Hiro cleared his throat.

1277
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,120
'Do you speak English, please?'

1278
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,920
The receptionist looked very doubtful about Hiro.

1279
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,960
Hiro knew what the man must think of him.

1280
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:39,280
Hiro was a poorly-dressed student 
standing at the desk of a five-star hotel.

1281
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,640
'Of course,' the receptionist 
answered in perfect English.

1282
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,600
'How may I help you?'

1283
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,600
Hiro tried to speak in a strong voice.

1284
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,160
'I'd like to see the manager, please.'

1285
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,200
The receptionist gave a small nod.

1286
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,900
'The manager is expecting you, of course...

1287
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:00,920
?'

1288
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,960
'No,' Hiro said.

1289
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,320
The receptionist smiled weakly.

1290
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:12,240
'Then I'm afraid I must ask you to 
arrange a meeting by telephone or email.

1291
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:17,160
I'm sure the manager will be 
very happy to see you then.'

1292
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,200
Hiro tried to keep calm.

1293
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,480
His heart was beating hard.

1294
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,160
'It's extremely important,' he said.

1295
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:29,800
'I really must see the manager now.'

1296
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:35,400
The receptionist smiled again and 
pressed a button at the side of the desk.

1297
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,120
Hiro felt the bright lights 
burning down on his head.

1298
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,080
He was hot and exhausted.

1299
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,000
'Please listen to me,' he said hopelessly.

1300
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,360
'This really is an emergency!'

1301
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:53,320
The receptionist continued to smile.

1302
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:59,120
Out of the corner of his eye, Hiro 
saw a man in uniform coming over.

1303
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:04,560
'You must listen to me,' Hiro said, almost crying.

1304
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,680
'There's going to be a murder here this evening!

1305
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,600
Please, you must believe me!

1306
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:20,120
Someone is planning to kill one 
of your guests!'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1307
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,520
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1308
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,640
Last hope!

1309
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:33,040
Five minutes later Hiro was sitting at a table 
in a small office at the back of the hotel.

1310
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,320
The man in uniform was standing at the door.

1311
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,520
His arms were crossed and he looked angry.

1312
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,400
Hiro felt almost like a prisoner in a cell.

1313
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:49,520
He supposed the man at the door imagined 
he might try to run out of the room.

1314
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,640
Perhaps he thought he would behave 
badly and embarrass the guests.

1315
01:35:54,480 --> 01:36:00,360
Hiro guessed that was the only 
reason he was not out on the street.

1316
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:04,840
After a couple of minutes, another 
man appeared in the doorway.

1317
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:09,880
He was very smartly dressed, like the 
receptionist, and also wore glasses,  

1318
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,440
but his hair was going grey at the sides.

1319
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:18,800
With a nod, he came round the 
table and sat opposite Hiro.

1320
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,320
'Good evening,' he said.

1321
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,880
He didn't offer to shake hands.

1322
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,440
'My name is Herr Fischer.

1323
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,600
I'm the duty manager here tonight.

1324
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,040
Could you tell me your name, please?'

1325
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:35,960
'Adachi,' Hiro answered, 
politely dropping his head.

1326
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,360
'Hiro Adachi.'

1327
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,640
'From Japan?' the duty manager asked.

1328
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:49,160
'Yes, I'm a student on a Study Year Abroad 
programme in England,' Hiro went on.

1329
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,520
'I'm here in Berlin on holiday.'

1330
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,520
'Excellent.'

1331
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,680
Fischer put his hands together 
very calmly on the table.

1332
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:03,360
'Now, please could you explain 
what you told the receptionist?

1333
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,120
I understand you told him...'

1334
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,000
The man paused.

1335
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,520
'You told him something unpleasant 
would happen in the hotel tonight.'

1336
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,320
Hiro knew he had to remain calm.

1337
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:22,640
If he seemed in any way crazy 
now, everything would be lost.

1338
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:25,440
'Yes,' Hiro said.

1339
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,800
'I'd better tell you immediately.

1340
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,960
I went to the police this morning, 
but they didn't believe me.

1341
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,280
But what I told them is completely true.

1342
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,440
Honestly!'

1343
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,240
'I see...'

1344
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:42,400
Fischer gave another patient nod.

1345
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,360
'You see I discovered someone 
is planning a murder here in  

1346
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:53,120
Room 319 this evening - it could 
be any time after eight o'clock.

1347
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,560
That's why it's an emergency.'

1348
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,280
'Yes, I completely understand.

1349
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:05,800
But perhaps you'd better start from the 
beginning?' Fischer gave a weak smile.

1350
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,720
Hiro nodded.

1351
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,640
'Of course.'

1352
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,920
He began his story.

1353
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:18,320
He tried to tell it slowly and calmly, but 
from time to time it became impossible.

1354
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,520
When he described how the 
Shark had tried to kill him,  

1355
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:28,920
then how Meier had kidnapped him and taken him 
to the 'safe house', it was really too horrible.

1356
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:35,160
But eventually Hiro came to the end, 
and looked up at Fischer helplessly.

1357
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:39,680
This man was his last hope!

1358
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:44,320
Fischer watched Hiro for a 
moment or two, then nodded.

1359
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:48,600
'Well, that's quite a story, Mr 
Adachi, quite a story indeed.

1360
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,880
Right, let's see if we can sort this out.'

1361
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,600
He paused and looked at Hiro seriously.

1362
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:00,280
'What was the name of the old man on the train?

1363
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:05,000
'Erik Bjornson, I think,' Hiro said.

1364
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,440
'Very good.'

1365
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,000
Fischer gave another nod.

1366
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,200
Immediately he reached across to the 
phone and pressed one of the buttons.

1367
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,600
A quick conversation in German followed.

1368
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:23,680
Hiro understood nothing 
except the name Erik Bjornson.

1369
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,560
At last the conversation came to an end.

1370
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,960
Fischer put down the phone, then calmly 
put his hands together as before.

1371
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,560
'Well, good news, Mr Adachi.

1372
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,720
First of all, I'm happy to tell you 
that there's no one by the name of  

1373
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:45,040
Erik Bjornson staying in the hotel 
- not in Room 319, nor in any other.

1374
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:49,600
And the guest in Room 319 
is someone called Schmidt.

1375
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,000
Mr Schmidt is a regular customer, I'm told.

1376
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,560
Does this information make 
you feel any less worried?'

1377
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,880
Hiro remained silent.

1378
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:05,520
Being Japanese, he always 
felt it was polite to agree.

1379
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,920
But this time he simply couldn't do it.

1380
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,400
He moved uncomfortably in his seat.

1381
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:17,720
'You still don't look happy, 
Mr Adachi,' Fischer continued.

1382
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,760
Hiro didn't know what to say.

1383
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,040
He searched for words.

1384
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:28,120
'But the Shark may be using 
another name,' he said at last.

1385
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:31,440
'He may not even be staying at the hotel.

1386
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:39,320
Don't you see, he could walk in at any 
time?' Hiro began to feel helpless again.

1387
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:43,000
Surely Fischer could 
understand what he was saying?

1388
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:48,840
Why did everyone think he was 
just a crazy student from Japan?

1389
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:52,520
Fischer looked at Hiro a little impatiently.

1390
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,880
'I'm sorry, Mr Adachi, but I think 
we've done as much as possible.

1391
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:00,280
For anything further, I really think 
you must return to the police.'

1392
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:06,240
'But in half an hour it'll be 
eight o'clock!' Hiro cried.

1393
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:13,320
'Then perhaps you shouldn't waste any more time 
discussing it with me,' Fischer replied sharply.

1394
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,520
Hiro didn't know what to do.

1395
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,560
His last chance was running away 
like sand through his fingers.

1396
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,360
'I must ask you to leave now, Mr Adachi.

1397
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,760
We've done all we can,' Fischer said.

1398
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,760
He got to his feet.

1399
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,480
'I'd like to thank you for your trouble.

1400
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:33,680
My colleague will show you out of the hotel.

1401
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:40,280
Hans!' Fischer said a few words in 
German to the man in uniform at the door.

1402
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,080
Hiro had forgotten the man was there.

1403
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,640
Hiro knew it was useless to say any more.

1404
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:50,600
The man in uniform moved forward.

1405
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,240
'Please follow me,' he said.

1406
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,040
Hiro didn't argue.

1407
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:01,280
He followed the man through the 
corridors with his head down.

1408
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:05,560
He felt terribly tired.

1409
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,160
They came out into the reception area.

1410
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,480
The bright lights hurt Hiro's eyes.

1411
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:15,760
The man led the way across 
towards the revolving door.

1412
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:22,480
Hiro's mind was completely 
empty; he had given all he could.

1413
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,080
The man stopped at the door.

1414
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:32,280
'Sayonara,' he said in Japanese, 
with an unpleasant smile.

1415
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:37,560
Hiro gave a shake of his head, but 
was too tired to say goodbye himself.

1416
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,520
He looked up at the door.

1417
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:46,600
It was already turning: an old man was just coming 
in, pulling a small case on wheels behind him.

1418
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:51,600
From his hat and clothes Hiro 
guessed the man must be a priest.

1419
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,360
Hiro stepped into the doorway 
and began moving through.

1420
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:01,320
At that moment the priest's eyes met Hiro's.

1421
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,480
They stared at him for one 
second only, then looked away,  

1422
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:10,640
but there was something about 
the stare that Hiro recognised.

1423
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:15,080
The next moment, as he stood 
on the pavement outside,  

1424
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:19,840
Hiro realised who had just entered the hotel.

1425
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,120
It was the Shark.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1426
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,400
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1427
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:33,360
Inside the Hotel Adlon

1428
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:38,320
For a second or two Hiro was 
completely unable to move.

1429
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,920
Even though the old man looked 
quite different dressed as a priest,  

1430
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,840
Hiro was absolutely certain who it was.

1431
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,080
But the idea that the Shark might change his  

1432
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:52,240
appearance had never really 
entered Hiro's head before.

1433
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,880
The memory of the priest he'd 
seen at the Brandenburg Gate  

1434
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:01,200
came back to him - of course, that was the Shark!

1435
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:05,960
He was sure too that the Shark had recognised him.

1436
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:12,040
Hiro's legs were shaking, but he couldn't 
stop staring in through the hotel window.

1437
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:16,840
The Shark was at the reception desk 
and was talking to the receptionist.

1438
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:20,320
The two of them seemed to 
be looking back at the door.

1439
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,040
Hiro turned away and walked quickly up the road.

1440
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,840
What should he do?

1441
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:33,560
His first thought was to turn and go back into 
the hotel, but he stopped himself immediately.

1442
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:40,600
As well as being a stupid and dangerous thing 
to do, Hiro knew he wouldn't get past the door.

1443
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,520
One of the men in uniform was 
sure to stop him at the entrance.

1444
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,440
Hiro knew as well that there 
was no point going back to the  

1445
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:53,040
police - even if they listened 
to him, it would be too late.

1446
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,240
With a sick feeling in his stomach,  

1447
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:03,920
he realised that if he were going to do 
anything, he would have to do it by himself.

1448
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,200
Hiro walked up and down the street.

1449
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,520
'Think!' he kept saying to himself.

1450
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:11,320
'Come on!

1451
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:17,600
You must think!' The sick feeling got 
worse with every second that passed.

1452
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,040
The Shark was in the hotel.

1453
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,960
Hiro had to act fast!

1454
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:27,800
He reached the end of the building, then stopped.

1455
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,040
A crazy idea came to him then.

1456
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,320
There was no time to lose.

1457
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,760
Guessing that the hotel must 
have an underground car park,  

1458
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:42,720
Hiro hurried back past the hotel entrance, 
then turned down the next side road.

1459
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:47,360
Thirty metres later, he found 
what he was looking for.

1460
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:52,920
A metal bar stretched across the entrance of the 
car park and there was an office to one side.

1461
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,080
Hiro walked past a couple of 
times, looking in at the office.

1462
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:03,120
A man was sitting at the window, with 
three or four TV screens above him,  

1463
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:08,000
but he was more interested in 
the newspaper open on his desk.

1464
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,720
After making sure there was no one watching,  

1465
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:15,240
Hiro hurried beneath the office 
window, then round the metal bar.

1466
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,680
It was simple.

1467
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:19,040
He was in!

1468
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,920
On one side of the car park he 
saw a row of expensive cars;  

1469
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:28,160
on the other a sign read 'Ablieferungen'.

1470
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:32,680
Hiro had no idea what it meant, 
but a few moments later a large  

1471
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:37,480
white van with pictures of fruit 
and vegetables on the side arrived.

1472
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:44,840
Hiro guessed he must be near the hotel kitchens 
and that the sign he had seen meant 'Deliveries'.

1473
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,600
There were voices just up ahead.

1474
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:52,840
Hiro dropped down behind a car and 
looked carefully round the next corner.

1475
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:58,120
A couple of young men were standing 
outside a doorway, smoking.

1476
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:02,920
They were wearing the white jackets of kitchen 
workers and they looked a little guilty,  

1477
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,040
as if they were breaking some kind of rule.

1478
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:09,680
Hiro just waited and watched.

1479
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:15,440
After five minutes, still laughing 
and chatting, they went back inside.

1480
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:21,360
Hiro waited half a minute longer, then ran up to 
the doorway where the two men had disappeared.

1481
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,840
The door was still half open.

1482
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:30,000
He pushed his way inside and found 
himself in a narrow corridor.

1483
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,840
Up ahead he could hear the sounds of the kitchen.

1484
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,160
He moved forward.

1485
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:39,840
Halfway down the corridor 
there was a door on the left.

1486
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,440
He stopped and listened.

1487
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:44,280
No sound.

1488
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:49,400
Very carefully he opened 
the door and looked inside.

1489
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:54,320
On one wall there was just a long 
shelf with huge cans of food,  

1490
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:59,760
but when he looked on the other side of 
the room, he couldn't believe his luck.

1491
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:04,760
On the back of another door, Hiro 
saw three or four white jackets,  

1492
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:08,200
similar to the ones the smokers had been wearing.

1493
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:11,200
If he put on one of these, Hiro thought,  

1494
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:16,000
he might be able to get through 
the kitchens without being stopped.

1495
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,720
There was no time for further thought.

1496
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:21,240
Hiro tried on the first jacket.

1497
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,760
It was far too big.

1498
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,400
He put it back and took the next.

1499
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,000
This time it was fine.

1500
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:35,320
He quickly buttoned the jacket all the way up 
to the neck and headed straight to the door.

1501
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,320
Then he stopped.

1502
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:40,600
Perhaps it would be better 
if he was carrying something;  

1503
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,840
it was less likely that he'd be stopped.

1504
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,840
Turning back, he picked up 
two of the big cans of food,  

1505
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,720
then decided to take a third can too, 
as it would hide half of his face.

1506
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,040
Then he went out through the door.

1507
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,040
He walked quickly.

1508
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,160
He couldn't stop and look around.

1509
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:04,400
He had to appear to know where he was going.

1510
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,040
He had to just trust his luck.

1511
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:12,240
To his amazement, it went like a dream.

1512
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,120
Hiro walked straight down the corridor and a  

1513
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:20,440
couple of seconds later found 
himself inside a huge kitchen.

1514
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:23,920
There were three men over to the 
right standing near the ovens,  

1515
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:28,920
but they didn't even look 
up, each busy at his job.

1516
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:33,360
Hiro walked straight ahead, 
then reached a half-open door.

1517
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,640
As he did so, he heard someone 
coming in the other direction.

1518
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,880
Immediately, Hiro turned round 
and pushed his way through the  

1519
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:47,720
door with his back - because he was carrying 
something it was the most natural thing to do.

1520
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:52,160
The other man hurried past without saying a word.

1521
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:56,680
Once he was through the door, 
Hiro found himself in a hall.

1522
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:59,880
There were further doors to the right and left.

1523
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,680
Long corridors led away almost out of view.

1524
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:08,840
In front of him there were 
stairs and the doors of a lift.

1525
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,440
Hiro thought about the lift.

1526
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,440
If it was a service lift, 
used only by hotel workers,  

1527
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:19,400
it might go all the way to 
the top of the building.

1528
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:23,040
He took a deep breath and pressed the button.

1529
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,560
The lift doors opened immediately.

1530
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,920
He stepped inside, then came out again.

1531
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:35,760
The cans he'd been carrying had been 
useful, but now he needed something else.

1532
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:42,240
Hiro put the cans down under the staircase, 
then noticed a pile of dirty sheets there.

1533
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:48,400
If he was carrying sheets, Hiro hoped he would 
again be mistaken for one of the hotel workers.

1534
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:53,000
He picked the sheets up and entered 
the lift just as the doors closed.

1535
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,600
He looked round for the buttons.

1536
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,440
Yes, it was just as he'd guessed!

1537
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:02,720
There were two floors below 
ground level, and seven above.

1538
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:05,120
If only his luck could continue.

1539
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:11,080
Surely, it was logical for Room 
319 to be on the third floor!

1540
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:14,240
He pressed the button showing '3'.

1541
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:22,040
The lift began to travel up.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1542
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,560
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1543
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:28,480
A little bit of Schubert

1544
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,640
When the lift came to a stop,  

1545
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:36,360
Hiro stepped out to find himself in a 
small area used only by hotel workers.

1546
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,040
Opposite the lift, there was a door.

1547
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,440
Hiro pushed it open.

1548
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:46,040
The next moment, as if going through 
a secret entrance hidden in the wall,  

1549
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:49,680
he came out into a public corridor of the hotel.

1550
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,880
He was halfway along.

1551
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:58,840
The corridor, its floor covered in deep 
red carpet, stretched in both directions.

1552
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,000
Hiro didn't know which way to go.

1553
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:10,160
He chose one way, but saw that the numbers 
on the doors were going up: 325, 327, 329.

1554
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:14,480
So he turned round, and the numbers 
on the doors began to go down,  

1555
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:18,200
even numbers on the left, 
odd numbers on the right.

1556
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:25,600
He followed them down: 325, 323, 321.

1557
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:32,200
As he passed this last room, he felt 
his heart begin to beat very fast.

1558
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:39,080
All of a sudden he was there: Room 319.

1559
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:42,720
He was about to knock, when he stopped himself.

1560
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:48,080
He realised he had no idea 
what he was going to say or do.

1561
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,280
His confidence suddenly left him.

1562
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:57,200
Was he really so certain a 
murder was about to take place?

1563
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:01,160
Hiro didn't hear the door 
to the room behind him open.

1564
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:06,000
Out of nowhere, he heard a 
voice speaking in German.

1565
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:12,840
Hiro turned to see a man of about thirty 
standing in the doorway of Room 320.

1566
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:18,920
The man looked quite tough - like a 
soldier perhaps, but in ordinary clothes.

1567
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,560
Hiro felt helpless.

1568
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:27,400
'I'm sorry, I don't understand 
German,' he said in English.

1569
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:29,920
The man looked confused.

1570
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,480
'You don't speak German?'

1571
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:35,280
'No,' Hiro said.

1572
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:37,960
The man narrowed his eyes.

1573
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,760
'But you work here?'

1574
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,960
Hiro felt weak at the knees.

1575
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,720
He'd forgotten the white jacket 
and the sheets he was carrying;  

1576
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:50,280
now he couldn't think how to explain them.

1577
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:55,160
'No, I'm a student,' he said quietly.

1578
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:59,160
'But I must see the man in this room, Mr Schmidt.

1579
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:03,120
I have some important information for him.'

1580
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:07,080
Immediately the man's body became tight.

1581
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,600
'I think you'd better tell me first.

1582
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,800
I'm a colleague of Mr Schmidt.'

1583
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,680
Hiro didn't know what to say.

1584
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:20,600
'Well, I'm waiting,' the man went on.

1585
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,840
Hiro wasn't sure if he could trust the man.

1586
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,280
But there was no time to decide.

1587
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,920
Hiro had to give an explanation.

1588
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:32,080
'I came to see Mr Schmidt because...'

1589
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:35,120
he began, then stopped.

1590
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:40,400
'Well, his life might be in danger.'

1591
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:44,360
Now the man's eyes became very sharp.

1592
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:49,560
'We'd better talk about this in 
my room,' he said after a moment.

1593
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,320
His voice made it clear that Hiro shouldn't argue.

1594
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:59,160
The man stood back and let 
Hiro go past into the room.

1595
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:01,040
As soon as they were both inside,  

1596
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:06,880
the man shut the door quickly and looked 
through the eyehole to the corridor outside.

1597
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:12,560
'Please sit down,' the man 
said, turning back to Hiro.

1598
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,480
Hiro dropped the sheets behind the 
door and chose the nearest chair.

1599
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:20,200
The man continued immediately.

1600
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:26,840
'OK, you say you're a student?' He 
didn't sit down or wait for an answer.

1601
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:31,920
'So, what information do you have for Mr Schmidt?'

1602
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:38,360
'I was on the train to Berlin,' 
Hiro began, his voice shaking.

1603
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:46,200
'By accident I looked at another man's phone 
and read a message - two messages, in fact.

1604
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:52,240
They talked about an assignment here in 
this hotel in Room 319 this evening.'

1605
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,040
The man looked surprised.

1606
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,960
'Go on,' he said quickly.

1607
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:02,840
'Well, the man on the train.

1608
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,920
He tried to kill me.

1609
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,640
And he's in the hotel now.

1610
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:11,880
I saw him only twenty minutes ago.'

1611
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:16,520
At that, the man pulled up 
another chair and sat very close.

1612
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:20,200
His voice became very serious.

1613
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:24,520
'This isn't a student joke, is it?' he said.

1614
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,600
'It's very important.

1615
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,440
Do you understand?'

1616
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,720
'Yes, I do.'

1617
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:35,280
Hiro looked straight back into the man's eyes.

1618
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,840
'I was kidnapped as well,' 
he added after a moment.

1619
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,560
'I've been very frightened.'

1620
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:46,960
The man paused, then nodded.

1621
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,880
'Do you know who Mr Schmidt really is?'

1622
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,240
Hiro shook his head.

1623
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,040
'No.

1624
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,040
What do you mean?

1625
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:59,200
Isn't Schmidt his real name?'

1626
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,880
'No, it isn't.'

1627
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:04,680
The man watched Hiro closely.

1628
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:08,960
After a moment's thought, he went on: 'Listen,  

1629
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,120
I'm going to tell you things 
which perhaps I shouldn't.

1630
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:16,320
But it seems there's very little 
time, so I'll have to take a chance.

1631
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:22,160
It doesn't matter who Schmidt is - it's enough 
to know he's someone extremely important.

1632
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:30,720
And for reasons I can't explain, Mr 
Schmidt is here in the hotel secretly.'

1633
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:33,920
'OK,' Hiro answered.

1634
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:41,040
'Well, I'm his bodyguard - his personal 
bodyguard - I'm here to make sure he's safe.

1635
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,640
Normally he has several bodyguards with him,  

1636
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:47,040
but as he's here in secret I'm 
the only one with him tonight.

1637
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,080
Understand?'

1638
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,120
Hiro nodded.

1639
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:55,840
The man was very serious 
now, sitting forward closely.

1640
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,880
'Now who is this man who's come to kill him?

1641
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,160
What does he look like?'

1642
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:03,640
Hiro coughed.

1643
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:06,640
For a second he couldn't speak.

1644
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,480
'He's old...

1645
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:12,920
but there's something really 
frightening about him.

1646
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:18,120
He's like a shark - he's 
got the same eyes and teeth.

1647
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:23,920
On the train he said his name was Erik 
Bjornson and that he was a businessman,  

1648
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:29,040
but he came into the hotel this 
evening dressed as a priest.'

1649
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,320
'A priest!' the man repeated.

1650
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:37,240
'Yes, I'm sure of it,' replied Hiro.

1651
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:41,520
The man jumped up from his 
chair and went to the door.

1652
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,960
For a moment he looked through the eyehole.

1653
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:47,280
Then he stood back.

1654
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:51,760
He thought for a second or two, then spoke again.

1655
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,280
'OK, listen.

1656
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,720
There's no time to call my colleagues, 
so I'm going to need your help.

1657
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:02,720
What's your phone number?' Hiro felt 
very frightened now, but he also had  

1658
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:10,760
the wonderful feeling that he wasn't on his own 
any more - someone had believed him at last.

1659
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,720
He told the man his number and the 
man typed it into his own phone.

1660
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,800
Immediately, he pressed 'Call'.

1661
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,040
Hiro's phone began to ring, then stopped.

1662
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:28,720
'Right,' the man said, 'you've 
got my number now as well.'

1663
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:33,280
He paused and sat down opposite Hiro again.

1664
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:36,560
'OK, this is what I want you to do.

1665
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,440
I'm going to try and get the pr-, I mean,  

1666
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:44,600
Mr Schmidt, out of this place, 
or at least into another room.

1667
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:47,000
I want you to stay here.

1668
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,840
Stand by the door and look 
out through the eyehole.

1669
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:57,880
If this guy shows up - the priest, that is 
- the second you see him, call my number.

1670
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:59,920
Is that clear?'

1671
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,280
'Yes,' Hiro answered.

1672
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,920
'Good.'

1673
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:06,920
The man sat up.

1674
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:12,840
He looked at Hiro for a second, 
then said, 'What's your name?'

1675
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,440
'Hiro Adachi.'

1676
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,320
'Mine's Schubert, Franz 
Schubert,' the man replied.

1677
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,960
He immediately held up his hand.

1678
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:26,760
'Yes, I know, there's a famous 
composer with the same name.

1679
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:29,680
My parents were crazy about classical music.

1680
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:33,600
Anyway, please call me Franz.'

1681
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:36,720
'OK, Franz,' Hiro said.

1682
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,600
'Great,' Schubert answered.

1683
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:42,600
He put a hand on Hiro's shoulder.

1684
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,040
'You've done brilliantly, Hiro.

1685
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:49,120
And you've been very brave.'

1686
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,040
He didn't delay any longer.

1687
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:59,120
Giving Hiro a nod, he got to his feet, picked 
up a small bag by the wall and went to the door.

1688
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:03,520
'OK, this is it,' he said.

1689
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:08,840
As he did so, he reached inside 
his jacket and pulled out a gun.

1690
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:13,920
There was something very 
cold-looking about the black metal.

1691
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:17,880
Then he dropped his arm down by his side.

1692
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:21,920
'See you in fifteen minutes,' 
he said in a whisper.

1693
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:27,680
The next moment the man had gone.

1694
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:31,440
Silence fell inside the room.

1695
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,640
Hiro looked at the door.

1696
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,880
Fear suddenly filled him.

1697
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:44,800
He was on his own again.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1698
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,080
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1699
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:51,640
A visit from the priest

1700
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:55,160
Hiro stood there staring at the 
door for five or six seconds,  

1701
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:59,040
then suddenly remembered he had a job to do.

1702
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:04,240
Without wasting another moment, 
he looked through the eyehole.

1703
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:07,120
The view was better than he expected.

1704
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:13,800
He could see a couple of metres down the corridor 
in addition to the door of Room 319 opposite.

1705
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,720
Schubert was there at that moment.

1706
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:21,840
Hiro could see him looking up and down the 
corridor, the gun still down at his side.

1707
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:29,040
About ten seconds later, 
the door to Room 319 opened.

1708
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:35,840
A woman, blonde and very attractive, wearing 
a red nightdress, stood in the doorway.

1709
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:41,960
She and Schubert talked for a moment, then she 
stepped back with a worried look on her face.

1710
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:47,440
Schubert went inside with her 
and the door closed immediately.

1711
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,720
A minute passed.

1712
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:51,840
Hiro kept his eye to the door,  

1713
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:57,360
only checking that Schubert's number was 
shown under 'Last Call' on his phone.

1714
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:02,920
When he looked back someone had come 
into view in the corridor outside.

1715
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:05,880
Hiro's heart beat faster.

1716
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,520
Could it be the Shark?

1717
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:11,080
Hiro looked more closely.

1718
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:17,920
No, it was a boy of sixteen or 
seventeen, wearing a smart hotel uniform.

1719
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,760
In his hand he was carrying 
a message on a metal plate.

1720
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:26,240
But could it be one of the Shark's friends?

1721
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:33,760
Hiro watched through the eyehole as the boy 
came directly to Hiro's door and knocked.

1722
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,200
Hiro didn't know what to do.

1723
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:41,760
He didn't want to open the door, but 
perhaps it really was a hotel worker.

1724
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:46,640
Perhaps the message was important 
- something Schubert should know.

1725
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:51,720
Hiro saw the boy look down the corridor, 
then heard him knock again, harder.

1726
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:56,800
This time Hiro decided he must answer.

1727
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,880
Very carefully, he opened the door.

1728
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:06,915
It was only half-open when there 
was a dull sound twice: dumf!

1729
02:04:06,915 --> 02:04:06,920
dumf!

1730
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,960
one after another.

1731
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,720
At the same moment the boy 
seemed to throw himself on Hiro,  

1732
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:16,360
his arms flying round him almost like a lover.

1733
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:21,200
Hiro was knocked back, crashed against 
the wall, and fell to the floor.

1734
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:25,760
The boy came down on top of him 
and lay there without moving.

1735
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:31,200
The plate he'd been holding 
banged loudly against the door.

1736
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,720
Hiro tried to get to his feet.

1737
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:37,320
He was so confused that for three or four seconds  

1738
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:42,040
he still didn't understand 
that the boy had been shot.

1739
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,880
Then someone else appeared in the doorway.

1740
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,360
It was the Shark.

1741
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:54,560
He was still dressed as a priest, but he 
was now holding a silenced gun at his side.

1742
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:59,680
Hiro tried to speak, but no 
sound would come from his mouth.

1743
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:06,760
'Yes, my friend, it's me,' said 
the Shark, with a sickly smile.

1744
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:11,000
'I apologise for my violent entry.'

1745
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:17,080
He kicked the legs of the young hotel worker 
out of the way and closed the door immediately.

1746
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:20,640
'A most unlucky young man.

1747
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:25,040
I needed some way to make you 
open the door,' he went on,  

1748
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:30,800
'and unfortunately for this boy, I chose him.'

1749
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:40,520
Then, getting down so he was level with Hiro, he 
continued, 'Right, now listen, my Japanese friend.

1750
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,640
I have very little time.

1751
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:50,000
I saw you come into this room 
and now I need some information.'

1752
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,240
Still fighting to get his breath, Hiro managed 
to pull himself free from the body on top of him.

1753
02:05:56,240 --> 02:06:01,040
As he did so, Hiro saw his 
jeans were covered in blood.

1754
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:08,360
For a second he thought he was bleeding, then he 
realised the blood belonged to the hotel worker.

1755
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:14,080
A scream grew in Hiro's 
throat, but wouldn't come out.

1756
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:17,320
The Shark had his face close to Hiro's.

1757
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,160
His teeth seemed very bright.

1758
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:26,440
'In a short time I am going to kill you.'

1759
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:30,040
Hiro was completely unable to speak.

1760
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,760
The Shark nodded his head.

1761
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:36,800
'Yes, be sure of this - I will kill you.

1762
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:40,040
But I can do it in two ways.'

1763
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,360
He came even closer.

1764
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,680
'The first way is with a bullet 
in the middle of the head.

1765
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,640
Tike this...'

1766
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,680
He pressed the gun into the middle of 
Hiro's forehead and made a clicking sound  

1767
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:55,000
with his tongue, then pulled it away.

1768
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,800
'You will not feel a thing.

1769
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:01,560
Very clean, very quick - you 
will like it!' He paused.

1770
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:05,360
'Or I can shoot you in the stomach.

1771
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,960
The pain is terrible, please believe me.'

1772
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:13,560
His eyes seemed to dance with 
pleasure as he considered this.

1773
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,040
'Yes, very terrible.

1774
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:19,840
That is why you Japanese commit 
hara-kiri by tearing a knife  

1775
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:26,640
through the stomach - because death 
is so slow and you suffer so much.

1776
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:31,720
Very brave people, you Japanese.'

1777
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:36,440
Now the Shark sat back on his heels, 
and watched Hiro thoughtfully.

1778
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:40,000
'So that is your choice, my friend.

1779
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:45,720
If you tell me what I wish to know, 
pop, pop in the head, all very fast.

1780
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:48,360
If you don't, you will die very slowly.

1781
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:51,440
So, which will you choose?'

1782
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:58,040
All the time the Shark was speaking, Hiro 
was trying to think what he could do.

1783
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,480
Was there nothing?

1784
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:02,160
Was this really the end?

1785
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:07,880
All day long he had been putting himself in 
danger, but somehow it hadn't seemed real.

1786
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:13,000
It had felt almost like a computer game 
which he could turn off when he'd had enough.

1787
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,160
Now this was completely real.

1788
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:23,920
He wanted to complain that the rules hadn't been 
properly explained, but he knew it was useless.

1789
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,640
He thought of Akiko suddenly.

1790
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:30,440
Would he never see her again after all?

1791
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:39,560
'So, which is it to be?' The Shark pressed 
the gun hard into Hiro's stomach and smiled.

1792
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,360
Hiro didn't answer.

1793
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:45,480
Thinking of Akiko had suddenly given him an idea.

1794
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:48,360
His phone was still in his hand.

1795
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,440
Could he manage to call Schubert 
without looking at the keys?

1796
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:57,640
He knew his phone so well - where all the 
different keys were and what they all did.

1797
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:01,880
If he could just get his hand in 
his pocket so it was out of view.

1798
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:08,640
All he needed to do then was bring up 
Schubert's number and press the 'Call' key.

1799
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:12,160
The Shark was waiting for his answer.

1800
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,320
'Well?'

1801
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:18,720
'What do you want to know?' Hiro said quickly.

1802
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:21,520
The Shark seemed surprised.

1803
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,040
'So, you choose the head!

1804
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:25,040
This is very good.

1805
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:28,440
Right, I need to know this.'

1806
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:30,680
Hiro had managed to sit up against the wall,  

1807
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:34,640
and already he had his hand with 
his phone in it in his pocket.

1808
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:37,440
He turned the phone around in his hand.

1809
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:39,760
Was it the correct way up?

1810
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:44,960
He had to feel for the keys, 
but without pressing too hard!

1811
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:50,440
'The man who went into Room 319,' the Shark began.

1812
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:53,880
'He is a bodyguard, yes?'

1813
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,440
'Yes,' Hiro answered.

1814
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:58,400
He had the phone the correct way up.

1815
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,160
He was sure of it.

1816
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:06,080
OK, now to bring up Schubert's number 
he had to press the 'Back' key.

1817
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:11,000
'And he is the only bodyguard, yes?'

1818
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,360
'Yes,' Hiro replied.

1819
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:16,000
His fingers felt around the keypad.

1820
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,320
Top right.

1821
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:19,400
That was the one to press.

1822
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,320
He did so without delay.

1823
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:27,080
'And why has the bodyguard gone into the room?'

1824
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,960
Hiro paused.

1825
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:33,440
'He's going to move Schmidt 
to another room, I think.'

1826
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:36,400
The Shark gave a short laugh.

1827
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:37,580
'Schmidt!

1828
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:38,760
Ha!

1829
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:40,640
That's very good.

1830
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:45,360
And has the bodyguard called for any help?'

1831
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,080
Hiro didn't answer.

1832
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,720
He was trying to think about the phone.

1833
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:53,880
The 'Call' key - it was top left, wasn't it?

1834
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:55,400
Or was it?

1835
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,520
Suddenly he wasn't so certain.

1836
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:03,720
'Come on!' The Shark's eyes 
were full of sudden anger.

1837
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:05,320
'Answer me!

1838
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:07,680
Are there more men coming?

1839
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:10,800
Do they know my description?'

1840
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,320
'No!' Hiro answered.

1841
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:16,520
'I don't know, I don't think so.'

1842
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,200
'You are lying!

1843
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:21,240
You told him I was dressed 
as a priest, didn't you?'

1844
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:26,840
Just as he was about to answer, Hiro remembered:  

1845
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:31,600
the 'Call' key wasn't at the 
top, it was the one below it.

1846
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,520
'Well?' the Shark shouted.

1847
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:38,320
'Maybe,' Hiro said quietly.

1848
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:46,600
Ah, the truth at last!' The Shark sat 
back for a moment, looking pleased.

1849
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:51,240
Anyway, it does not matter, I have what I need.'

1850
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:54,240
He sat forward again.

1851
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:58,040
'My friend, the time has come.

1852
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:05,000
I am sorry that it is not possible to get to know 
you better - you seem a very brave young man.

1853
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,520
But...'

1854
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:10,640
The Shark lifted his hands as if in apology.

1855
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:14,320
Hiro felt a tight ball of 
fear rise in his throat again.

1856
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:17,720
His fingers moved over the 
keys on his phone again.

1857
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,160
Was this right?

1858
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:21,160
Did he have the correct key?

1859
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,400
There was no time to think about it any more.

1860
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:27,520
He pressed hard with his thumb.

1861
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:32,560
The Shark raised the gun and 
pointed it at Hiro's head.

1862
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,800
Hiro thought he might cry.

1863
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,680
He had to keep the Shark talking.

1864
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:40,480
How long would it be before Schubert replied?

1865
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:44,280
Schubert was Hiro's last hope.

1866
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:47,760
Wait!' Hiro called hopelessly.

1867
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:56,040
'Please, please, I know you're going to 
kill me, but will you do one thing for me?'

1868
02:12:56,040 --> 02:13:00,040
The old man suddenly gave a grandfatherly look.

1869
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:05,280
A dying wish?' His eyes went small again.

1870
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,280
'What is it?'

1871
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:11,800
Hiro had to keep the Shark talking 
for just a few seconds more.

1872
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,240
He said the first thing that came into his head.

1873
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:18,040
'It's my girlfriend, Akiko.

1874
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:21,560
We broke up just before I came to Berlin.

1875
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:25,360
Will you send her a message for me?'

1876
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:29,360
'Ha!' The Shark gave a sudden laugh.

1877
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:31,120
'How romantic!

1878
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:37,160
Now I am to bring two lovers together in death!'

1879
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,400
Hiro was unable to breathe.

1880
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,440
Perhaps he'd got the keys all wrong.

1881
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:44,560
Maybe there wasn't any hope...

1882
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:52,920
'And what is the tearful message you wish me 
to send?' The Shark had his caring look again.

1883
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,280
'Please tell her...'

1884
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:57,440
Hiro started.

1885
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:00,280
'Yes?' said the Shark.

1886
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:02,840
'I want you to tell her...'

1887
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:05,160
Hiro began again.

1888
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:08,440
The Shark suddenly tired of the game.

1889
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:09,200
'Bah!

1890
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:11,360
You are trying to waste time.

1891
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:14,160
You think I am stupid?'

1892
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:17,160
'No!' cried Hiro.

1893
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:20,720
All of a sudden there was a tiny sound.

1894
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:24,440
It came from Hiro's pocket.

1895
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:27,520
There was silence in the room for a second.

1896
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,240
Then it came again.

1897
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:31,600
It was a voice.

1898
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:35,200
'Hiro?' it said quietly.

1899
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:45,200
Then more loudly, 'Hiro, it's Franz!'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1900
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:47,240
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

1901
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:51,080
A surprise visitor

1902
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:56,280
'What is that?' the Shark asked sharply.

1903
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:59,280
'I don't know,' Hiro lied.

1904
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:03,400
He could hear Schubert saying his name repeatedly.

1905
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:07,200
'It is your phone!' the Shark said.

1906
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,680
His eyes were on fire.

1907
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:12,400
'Give it to me!'

1908
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:16,440
Very slowly, Hiro took the phone from his pocket.

1909
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:20,040
Schubert's voice was clear all of a sudden.

1910
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:21,120
'Hiro?

1911
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:22,480
Hiro?

1912
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:26,920
What's going on?' Hiro could hardly believe it.

1913
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:29,320
The plan had worked!

1914
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:33,040
But now the Shark was boiling with anger.

1915
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:39,520
He shouted a word in a foreign language that 
Hiro didn't recognise, then went back to English.

1916
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,240
'What have you done?

1917
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:48,400
You have called this man!' He was shaking 
the gun right in front of Hiro's eyes.

1918
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,920
The Shark's face suddenly became very hard.

1919
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:54,720
This is it, Hiro thought.

1920
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,880
Now comes the shot.

1921
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:59,360
Schubert had stopped speaking now.

1922
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,360
Perhaps he was crossing the 
corridor at that moment;  

1923
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:05,560
perhaps he would crash 
through the door any second.

1924
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:08,840
But it didn't matter what the bodyguard did now.

1925
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:12,120
Hiro knew it would be too late.

1926
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:18,760
Helplessly, he put his hand up in front of his 
face as if he imagined he could stop the bullets.

1927
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:20,920
He prepared himself for the shot.

1928
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:24,480
But it didn't come.

1929
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:29,840
Instead, the Shark pulled 
the phone from Hiro's hand.

1930
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:35,319
'Who is this?' the Shark 
said angrily into the phone.

1931
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:38,040
Hiro couldn't hear what Schubert replied.

1932
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:44,080
The gun was still pointing at Hiro's 
head and it was very difficult to think.

1933
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:49,559
'Right,' the Shark went on in a new quieter voice.

1934
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:50,840
'Listen to me.

1935
02:16:51,399 --> 02:16:55,080
I believe you know who you are talking to.

1936
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:59,160
As you must know, I have the Japanese boy with me.

1937
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:05,240
If you try anything stupid, 
I will shoot him immediately.

1938
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:08,000
Is that clear?'

1939
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:13,920
Again Hiro supposed that Schubert replied, 
but he had no idea what Schubert said.

1940
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,480
The Shark interrupted.

1941
02:17:16,479 --> 02:17:18,759
'All right, shut up!

1942
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:20,320
Listen to me.

1943
02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:26,240
I am going to leave this hotel with the boy 
and you will not do anything to stop me.

1944
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:29,240
I have already killed one of the hotel workers.

1945
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:32,599
Now, this is what I want.

1946
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:38,000
Are you listening carefully?' 
He got quickly to his feet,  

1947
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,240
made his way over to the door, 
and looked through the eyehole.

1948
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:46,880
Next he went over to the window, 
and looked out into the night.

1949
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:51,160
All the time he kept the gun pointing at Hiro.

1950
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:54,519
Very soon he came back.

1951
02:17:54,520 --> 02:18:00,081
'In a couple of minutes' time, the boy 
and I are going to leave this room.

1952
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:07,080
We will go down to the back entrance of the hotel 
- I want you to have a taxi waiting there for us.

1953
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:13,280
I will tell the driver where to go, but 
you will not attempt to follow the taxi.

1954
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:19,759
If there is trouble at any 
point, the Japanese boy will die.

1955
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:20,760
Is that clear?

1956
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:25,040
I will give you three minutes to arrange this.

1957
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:30,000
Call me back when everything is ready.'

1958
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,920
The Shark pressed the 'End Call' key 
and dropped the phone into his pocket.

1959
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:39,000
Then he looked across to Hiro.

1960
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,840
'This does not mean you will 
live after all,' he said.

1961
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:49,760
'If I could, I would kill you twice!'

1962
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:54,440
Listening to the Shark, Hiro 
felt strangely dead already.

1963
02:18:54,439 --> 02:19:00,599
He was so tired; the last 
twenty-four hours had been so hard.

1964
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:03,121
It seemed as if he was watching himself in a crazy  

1965
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:08,599
film, watching helplessly as it 
showed the story of his life.

1966
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:14,161
'Get up!' the Shark said, coming 
towards him with the gun again.

1967
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:17,200
Hiro climbed slowly to his feet.

1968
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:20,120
He wondered what was coming next.

1969
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:27,800
'Now, go over to the door and pull the 
boy out of the way,' the Shark ordered.

1970
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:30,120
Hiro felt ill again.

1971
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:34,680
He moved across and reached 
down for the boy's arms.

1972
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:39,560
It didn't hit him till then 
that the boy was really dead.

1973
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:45,320
Other than his grandfather, this was the 
first time Hiro had seen a dead person.

1974
02:19:45,319 --> 02:19:50,639
When he tried to lift the boy's 
shoulders they felt so heavy and so warm.

1975
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:55,519
Was there really no life?

1976
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:00,680
Only ten minutes before, the boy had 
been knocking cheerfully on the door.

1977
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:03,640
Hiro wanted to cry.

1978
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:07,241
The Shark was watching him closely.

1979
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:11,439
'First time?' he asked coldly.

1980
02:20:11,439 --> 02:20:13,200
'Have no fear.

1981
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:17,439
Dead people don't usually complain.'

1982
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:22,679
He gave his horrible toothy smile for a 
moment, then his face went hard again.

1983
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:27,400
'Come on - don't waste time.'

1984
02:20:27,399 --> 02:20:30,839
Hiro pulled at the body in his arms.

1985
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:34,720
'I'm sorry,' he said under his breath.

1986
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:37,400
At last the body moved.

1987
02:20:37,399 --> 02:20:44,679
As Hiro pulled the boy across the carpet a 
long bright red line of blood was left behind.

1988
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:47,920
Hiro thought he would be sick.

1989
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:53,120
A moment later Hiro's phone rang 
again in the Shark's pocket.

1990
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:59,359
Hiro saw the Shark reach into his clothes, 
then a number of things happened very suddenly.

1991
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:03,920
First of all there was a very bright 
light and a terrific explosion,  

1992
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:06,800
then the room went completely dark.

1993
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:10,520
At the same time a cloud of smoke filled the room.

1994
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:14,236
Hiro heard shots: again the dumf!

1995
02:21:14,235 --> 02:21:14,240
dumf!

1996
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:20,559
of a silenced gun - then a loud cry of 
'Aaghh!' followed by the crashing of furniture.

1997
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:28,880
After that there was a strange 
silence, like the end of the world.

1998
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:34,040
For a moment or two Hiro wondered if he was dead.

1999
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:37,120
Then the lights came on again.

2000
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:40,680
It took a little while for the 
smoke in the room to clear.

2001
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:44,640
When it did, Hiro saw that 
the door to the room had gone.

2002
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:47,800
It lay on the floor, broken in pieces.

2003
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:50,640
Standing over it was Schubert.

2004
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:55,281
On the floor opposite him lay the Shark.

2005
02:21:55,280 --> 02:22:00,120
The old man was still alive, but he 
was holding his stomach very tightly.

2006
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:04,479
Already blood had started to appear 
through the priest's clothes;  

2007
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:08,919
no matter how hard he held his 
stomach, he couldn't seem to stop it.

2008
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:14,240
'Sorry to come in without 
knocking,' Schubert said coolly.

2009
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,240
The Shark's eyes were tight with pain.

2010
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:22,359
Very slowly, he turned his head 
and looked directly at Hiro.

2011
02:22:22,359 --> 02:22:28,799
His face had gone as white as a sheet, but 
his teeth still shone in the bright light.

2012
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:42,680
In a quiet voice he said, 'I wish I had chosen 
another seat on the train.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2013
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:44,680
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

2014
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:48,040
A note of thanks

2015
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:54,000
At two o'clock the next afternoon Hiro was 
sitting with Schubert in the Funkturm Restaurant,  

2016
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:59,880
halfway up the famous TV and radio 
tower in the Spandau area of Berlin.

2017
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:02,160
It was a beautiful day.

2018
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:08,359
The sun was shining and from up there, you 
could see far across the city - huge roads  

2019
02:23:08,359 --> 02:23:15,120
busy with traffic, parks, even lakes 
and forests far away outside the city.

2020
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:19,880
In the distance a jet was just 
climbing into the air from the airport;  

2021
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:23,680
it seemed to stick in the sky without moving.

2022
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:29,400
'This restaurant is famous for its seafood,' 
Schubert said, looking at the menu.

2023
02:23:29,399 --> 02:23:32,120
'Why don't we go for that?'

2024
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:37,399
'It's very expensive,' Hiro 
answered, noticing the prices.

2025
02:23:37,399 --> 02:23:41,479
'Don't worry about that,' Schubert said quickly.

2026
02:23:41,479 --> 02:23:43,559
'Someone very rich is paying.

2027
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:51,920
Let's make the most of it!' Without discussing it 
any more, Schubert gave the waiter their order.

2028
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:56,319
When the waiter had gone, 
Schubert turned to the window.

2029
02:23:56,319 --> 02:23:57,319
'There.

2030
02:23:57,319 --> 02:24:03,399
Berlin's not so bad, is it?' 
he said, pointing at the view.

2031
02:24:03,399 --> 02:24:08,240
Hiro was about to answer when 
Schubert's mobile phone rang.

2032
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:13,840
Schubert listened quietly to a message for half 
a minute or so, then excused himself and went  

2033
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:19,760
off to a quiet part of the restaurant 
in order to continue the conversation.

2034
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:25,880
While Schubert was gone, Hiro thought 
back over what had happened that morning.

2035
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:29,560
They had spent most of the 
time in Schubert's head office.

2036
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:32,920
'The Bundesamt fur Verfassungsschutz - Home  

2037
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:37,680
Security,' Schubert had 
said by way of explanation.

2038
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,201
There, Hiro had spent two hours in front of a  

2039
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:44,840
computer screen looking at 
photos of known criminals.

2040
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:50,319
The only man Hiro could definitely recognise 
was the driver who had picked him up with Meier.

2041
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:54,800
Hiro was disappointed, but Schubert wasn't.

2042
02:24:54,800 --> 02:25:02,600
Once they found this man, he said darkly, it 
would be simple to get Meier and anyone else.

2043
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:06,720
After that Schubert had 
said it was time for lunch.

2044
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:11,880
Schubert had put a blue emergency light on 
the roof of his BMW and they'd raced through  

2045
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:16,800
the streets of Berlin, laughing 
like a pair of silly children.

2046
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:23,960
The journey had made Hiro feel happier than 
he had been for weeks - and very important.

2047
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:28,279
Now, sitting up there in the 
restaurant, drink in hand,  

2048
02:25:28,279 --> 02:25:32,319
Hiro found it hard to believe 
all the things that had happened.

2049
02:25:32,319 --> 02:25:38,759
He felt so safe and relaxed now, 
looking out across the city.

2050
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:42,120
Had the Shark really tried to kill him?

2051
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,399
It seemed like a dream.

2052
02:25:44,399 --> 02:25:48,399
Had it all really happened?

2053
02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:54,559
As if in answer to Hiro's thoughts, Schubert 
came back to the table and sat down.

2054
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:58,121
He looked at Hiro before speaking.

2055
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:01,479
'He's dead,' he said.

2056
02:26:01,479 --> 02:26:04,319
Hiro was confused for a moment.

2057
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:06,439
'Our friend, the Shark.

2058
02:26:06,439 --> 02:26:09,639
He died an hour ago.'

2059
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,360
'Oh,' Hiro said.

2060
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:16,160
It felt as if a cold hand had run down his back.

2061
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,920
'I'm sorry,' he said.

2062
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:22,760
'Don't be sorry,' Schubert replied quickly.

2063
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:24,920
'The man was a professional assassin.

2064
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:27,520
He made his living from death.

2065
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:30,960
He nearly killed you too.'

2066
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:35,040
'Yes, I know,' Hiro answered.

2067
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:37,920
'Anyway, let's give him his real name.

2068
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:43,040
I've just been told he was actually a 
Norwegian by the name of Karl-Henrik Johansen.

2069
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:48,519
Interpol, the International Police, have 
apparently been looking for him for years.

2070
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:56,920
He was wanted for eleven murders - one of them the 
president of a certain country in South America.'

2071
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:59,399
Hiro didn't know what to say.

2072
02:26:59,399 --> 02:27:02,679
He kept remembering the last 
time he had seen the Shark,  

2073
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:08,560
as the old man was being carried to the 
ambulance, his face white with pain.

2074
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:11,520
'Of course, it was because 
he came from abroad that he  

2075
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:15,520
needed to collect a gun from 
Meier at the Brandenburg Gate.

2076
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:20,161
It would be much too dangerous to try 
and bring a gun into the country.'

2077
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:23,279
Hiro went silent.

2078
02:27:23,279 --> 02:27:28,880
Every mention now of the gun reminded 
Hiro of the young hotel worker.

2079
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:32,600
Schubert was watching Hiro carefully.

2080
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:36,480
'What's wrong?' he asked quietly.

2081
02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:38,879
'Is it the boy?'

2082
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,080
Hiro nodded.

2083
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:43,720
'I keep remembering...'

2084
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:46,560
Schubert reached out an arm.

2085
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:49,720
'Try not to think about that.'

2086
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:54,480
Very gently, he added, 'If it helps at all,  

2087
02:27:54,479 --> 02:28:03,319
I can tell you he didn't suffer - he was killed 
immediately - the shots went through his heart.'

2088
02:28:03,319 --> 02:28:07,080
Neither man spoke for a while.

2089
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:10,240
Hiro tried to think about something else.

2090
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:16,319
When he felt calmer again he said, 'I'm 
surprised the Shark decided to continue  

2091
02:28:16,319 --> 02:28:20,279
with the assassination plan after what happened.'

2092
02:28:20,279 --> 02:28:23,399
'Yes, it was a bad mistake.'

2093
02:28:23,399 --> 02:28:26,200
Schubert looked at Hiro.

2094
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:30,240
'I think he didn't like losing to a kid...'

2095
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:36,160
Schubert seemed embarrassed for a 
moment, then went on quickly, 'I'm sorry.

2096
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:41,680
I'm not suggesting you're a kid - but I 
guess the Shark thought of you like that.

2097
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:45,840
You were brilliant, you know,' Schubert added.

2098
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:50,040
'What you did was very, very special.'

2099
02:28:51,479 --> 02:28:55,319
Now it was Hiro's turn to be embarrassed.

2100
02:28:55,319 --> 02:29:01,200
Fortunately, at that moment the waiter 
arrived, so Hiro didn't need to answer.

2101
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:03,760
A huge plate of seafood was placed in front of  

2102
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:09,440
him - Hiro suddenly realised 
he was terrifically hungry.

2103
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:12,679
'Guten Appetit', Schubert said.

2104
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:16,680
'Itadakimasu' Hiro replied.

2105
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:20,360
They both ate happily in silence for a short time.

2106
02:29:20,359 --> 02:29:24,880
Then Schubert sat back and looked closely at Hiro.

2107
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:30,400
'Hiro, I need to talk to you 
about Mr Schmidt,' he began.

2108
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:35,839
'You've been so extraordinarily brave it's 
only fair you should know something about him.

2109
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:40,040
But I'm very sorry, I still 
can't tell you his real name.

2110
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:49,080
I will say this though: the person whose 
life you saved is very, very important.'

2111
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:53,439
'He's in the government?' Hiro asked.

2112
02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:56,639
Schubert looked directly at Hiro.

2113
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:58,201
'I can't say.

2114
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:02,840
But he's someone of the very highest importance.'

2115
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:07,880
'And you can't tell me why the Shark was 
hired to kill him either, I suppose...'

2116
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:09,800
Hiro said.

2117
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:12,720
Schubert gave a weak smile.

2118
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:16,360
'Important people make important enemies.

2119
02:30:16,359 --> 02:30:20,399
We think Meier's men have been 
trying to kill Schmidt for months.

2120
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:28,240
After an earlier plan failed, it seems they 
decided to hire the best - that is, the Shark.'

2121
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:30,840
Hiro was confused.

2122
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:32,600
'Then why...

2123
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:37,040
why was Schmidt in a hotel with 
only you there - why was he there  

2124
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:41,519
in secret?' Schubert looked embarrassed again.

2125
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:44,241
After a moment he sat forward.

2126
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:50,279
'Sometimes, Hiro, a man like Mr Schmidt has 
part of his life he wishes to keep private.

2127
02:30:50,279 --> 02:30:52,719
That's why he meets his friend in a hotel.

2128
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:57,520
That's why I was the only bodyguard at the hotel.

2129
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:01,360
Do you understand what I'm saying?'

2130
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:06,960
Hiro suddenly remembered the blonde woman who 
had opened the door of Schmidt's hotel room.

2131
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,640
'You mean...'

2132
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,840
he said slowly.

2133
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:15,480
'Somehow Meier and his men 
found out about Mr Schmidt's...'

2134
02:31:15,479 --> 02:31:18,279
Schubert searched for the right word.

2135
02:31:18,279 --> 02:31:21,519
'Mr Schmidt's arrangement.

2136
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:26,480
When they did, they saw an 
opportunity to kill him.'

2137
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:28,719
Hiro stared at Schubert.

2138
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:31,640
The man had told him as much as he could.

2139
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,960
Hiro nodded.

2140
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:36,160
'I think I understand.

2141
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:38,800
Thank you for telling me.'

2142
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:41,160
Schubert shook his head.

2143
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:45,800
'No, no, we must thank you.'

2144
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:48,360
He gave a little cough.

2145
02:31:48,359 --> 02:31:54,080
'Actually, while we're on that 
subject, I have something for you.'

2146
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:59,680
He reached into his pocket, pulled out 
an envelope and held it for a moment.

2147
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:06,160
'Mr Schmidt asked me to give you this,' 
Schubert said and handed the envelope across.

2148
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:09,080
Hiro looked at it for a moment or two.

2149
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:13,040
'Go on, open it,' Schubert said.

2150
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:15,560
Hiro did as he was told.

2151
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:19,840
Inside there was a second envelope 
and a small hand-written note.

2152
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:23,360
In English, the note read:

2153
02:32:23,359 --> 02:32:26,240
'Thank you so much for all you have done for me.

2154
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:29,040
You are a true samurai.

2155
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:31,560
Enjoy your trip.'

2156
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:37,081
The note was signed with 
the single word: 'Schmidt'.

2157
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:41,200
Hiro put down the note and 
opened the second envelope.

2158
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:49,840
Inside were ten completely new 
five-hundred-euro notes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2159
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:54,680
CHAPTER NINETEEN

2160
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:59,201
A friendly word of advice

2161
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:06,519
Two hours later, after a delicious lunch, Hiro and 
Schubert took the lift back down to the ground.

2162
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:11,880
They climbed into Schubert's BMW 
and set off back to the city centre.

2163
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:16,640
Schubert wasn't in any hurry and 
this time he drove much more slowly,  

2164
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:19,760
window down, enjoying the sunshine.

2165
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:28,000
After the excitement of the meal and the money 
from Schmidt, Hiro suddenly felt strangely empty.

2166
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:33,160
He had the odd feeling that he was 
returning to real life at last.

2167
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:38,479
In one way that was good: to know 
that he was safe was wonderful.

2168
02:33:38,479 --> 02:33:44,599
But returning to reality also meant 
remembering his breakup with Akiko.

2169
02:33:44,600 --> 02:33:49,880
How he wished he could share 
Schmidt's present with her!

2170
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:53,160
It was as if Schubert could read his thoughts.

2171
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:58,639
The very next moment, looking across 
as he drove, Schubert asked, 'So,  

2172
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:05,920
my friend, have you decided how to 
spend the money?' Hiro bit his lip.

2173
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:09,200
He looked away, out of the window.

2174
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:13,319
'I'm not sure,' he said quietly.

2175
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:16,040
'I think I might save it.'

2176
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:18,880
'What?' Schubert cried out.

2177
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:19,800
'Come on!

2178
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:21,480
Don't be so boring.

2179
02:34:21,479 --> 02:34:23,399
Enjoy part of it, at least.

2180
02:34:23,399 --> 02:34:24,279
Fly somewhere!

2181
02:34:24,279 --> 02:34:25,639
Go somewhere special!

2182
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:28,520
Take your girlfriend!'

2183
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:32,000
It was the very worst thing Schubert could say.

2184
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,080
For a moment Hiro thought he 
might break into tears - the  

2185
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:40,080
last twenty-four hours had taken all his strength.

2186
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:45,040
He bit his lip so hard this 
time, that he tasted blood.

2187
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,519
Schubert noticed.

2188
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:53,840
'Hey, did I say something 
wrong?' he asked more gently.

2189
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,360
Hiro felt too tired to lie.

2190
02:34:57,359 --> 02:35:03,639
'I broke up with my girlfriend just 
before I came here,' he said at last.

2191
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:06,480
Schubert looked embarrassed.

2192
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:08,479
'I'm sorry.'

2193
02:35:08,479 --> 02:35:15,519
Very quietly, he added, 'And it 
was her decision, not yours?'

2194
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:17,720
Hiro nodded.

2195
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:19,640
'I still don't know how it happened.

2196
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:24,160
I thought we were really happy together.'

2197
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:29,040
He closed his eyes as all the memories came back.

2198
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:33,560
A hundred metres up the road 
Schubert stopped the car.

2199
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:36,760
'Why don't you tell me about it?' he said.

2200
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:41,400
'What happened?' Hiro opened his eyes.

2201
02:35:41,399 --> 02:35:43,679
They were next to a park.

2202
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:49,760
In the distance he could see a young couple 
walking hand-in-hand through the trees.

2203
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:54,200
'I just don't understand,' Hiro began.

2204
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:56,519
He shook his head again.

2205
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:58,760
'We had a terrible argument.

2206
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:01,000
We were planning a holiday together.

2207
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:05,840
Then, out of nowhere, this awful fight started.'

2208
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,960
'Go on,' Schubert said.

2209
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:14,800
'Well, this is going to sound 
crazy, but it was about my dog.

2210
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:19,200
I have a dog, Yuki - she's a golden retriever.

2211
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:24,359
Anyway, I have her photo on 
my phone as the screensaver.

2212
02:36:24,359 --> 02:36:28,599
My girlfriend thought her 
photo should be there instead.

2213
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:33,720
I couldn't understand how she 
could be jealous of a dog.'

2214
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:36,720
Schubert made an odd face.

2215
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:37,760
'Really?

2216
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:40,880
It doesn't sound like a good reason to break up.

2217
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:44,560
Are you sure there wasn't something else?'

2218
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:47,480
Hiro looked back at Schubert.

2219
02:36:47,479 --> 02:36:49,639
'What do you mean?'

2220
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:53,720
'Well, people don't always talk 
about things directly, Hiro.

2221
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:55,720
Come on, you know that.

2222
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:57,400
Girls are the worst!

2223
02:36:57,399 --> 02:37:01,160
There was probably another reason.'

2224
02:37:01,160 --> 02:37:03,680
Hiro tried to think back.

2225
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:07,280
He could remember the whole argument perfectly.

2226
02:37:07,279 --> 02:37:11,200
He'd come to her room to talk, to 
tell her that he'd asked Daijiro  

2227
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,639
and Ayumu and their girlfriends to join the trip.

2228
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:17,680
And Akiko had been fine with that.

2229
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:21,080
She'd said, 'Great, that's lovely.'

2230
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:25,439
She'd said, 'The more, the 
better!' She didn't seem to mind...

2231
02:37:25,439 --> 02:37:28,439
She didn't...

2232
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:31,639
Schubert broke into Hiro's thoughts.

2233
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:33,840
'What is it?'

2234
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:36,240
'I've just thought of something.

2235
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:41,960
When we were planning our trip, I thought 
it would be nice if we invited some others.

2236
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:44,160
You don't think...?'

2237
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:47,080
'Go on,' said Schubert.

2238
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:51,640
'Well, it was a couple of 
guys and their girlfriends.

2239
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:57,840
You don't think she was jealous 
about that, do you?' Hiro asked.

2240
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:03,120
Just as he said it, a horrible 
idea came crashing into his head.

2241
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:06,120
Ayumu's girlfriend was Risa.

2242
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:11,640
Risa was from Hiro's college in 
Japan and he'd once invited her out.

2243
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:14,640
Perhaps Akiko had found out about that.

2244
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:17,440
Perhaps she thought...

2245
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:21,240
Schubert looked at Hiro and shook his head.

2246
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:24,880
'Oh dear, my friend,' he said.

2247
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:28,400
'You may be too clever for 
an international assassin,  

2248
02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:32,040
but it seems a young woman is too much for you.

2249
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:37,920
You were planning a romantic holiday for two, 
and then you invite another two girls along.

2250
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:41,120
I imagine the girls are pretty?'

2251
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,080
Hiro felt suddenly very sick.

2252
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:48,319
'So-so,' he answered, giving a small cough.

2253
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:52,240
'Well, of course, she was 
jealous!' Schubert broke in.

2254
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:56,719
'She simply pretended it was the dog, so 
she didn't have to admit it was the girls.

2255
02:38:56,720 --> 02:38:59,280
What happened afterwards?'

2256
02:38:59,279 --> 02:39:04,880
'She said she never wanted to 
see me again,' Hiro replied.

2257
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:07,319
'So, you believed her, I suppose.

2258
02:39:07,319 --> 02:39:12,000
And being a brave samurai, you've 
been too proud to call her again.

2259
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,600
I guess you didn't apologise?' asked Schubert.

2260
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,760
Hiro didn't say anything.

2261
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,000
He felt a mix of anger and 
sudden love for Schubert.

2262
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:28,720
The man had made him feel 
terribly stupid and small.

2263
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:31,640
Schubert watched Hiro.

2264
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:36,440
For about ten seconds neither 
of them said anything.

2265
02:39:36,439 --> 02:39:39,359
Then Schubert spoke again:

2266
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:41,679
'Right, my friend, you've done something for me.

2267
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:43,600
Now I'm going to do something for you.

2268
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:45,920
Get out your phone.'

2269
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,880
Hiro didn't argue.

2270
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:51,840
'Now find me her number,' Schubert ordered.

2271
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:55,200
Hiro's heart had begun to beat very hard.

2272
02:39:55,200 --> 02:40:01,479
He selected 'Menu', then 'Phone 
book', then found Akiko's number.

2273
02:40:01,479 --> 02:40:02,759
'OK.'

2274
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:05,160
Schubert got out of the car.

2275
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:10,519
He walked round to the passenger door, 
opened it, then said very strongly, 'Right.

2276
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:12,241
Get out.'

2277
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:14,559
Hiro did as he was told.

2278
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:17,480
Schubert pointed across the park.

2279
02:40:17,479 --> 02:40:19,479
'Do you see that seat over there?

2280
02:40:19,479 --> 02:40:22,080
You're going to walk over to it and sit down.

2281
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:26,680
And then you're going to press that number.'

2282
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:30,360
Hiro realised his lip was shaking.

2283
02:40:30,359 --> 02:40:32,479
'What shall I say?'

2284
02:40:32,479 --> 02:40:37,120
'You'll think of something,' Schubert replied.

2285
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:39,800
Hiro didn't move for a moment or two.

2286
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:44,920
Then he felt Schubert's hand 
on his back, pushing him away.

2287
02:40:44,920 --> 02:40:47,720
Hiro walked slowly up the path.

2288
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:52,040
His legs felt heavy, almost too heavy to move.

2289
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:57,840
The sun was hot on the back of his neck as well 
and he felt a little sick from all the food.

2290
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:03,319
At last he reached the seat and sat down.

2291
02:41:03,319 --> 02:41:05,759
He looked across at the car.

2292
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:10,800
Schubert was sitting inside again, 
watching through the window.

2293
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:15,960
Hiro felt nearly as nervous as when the 
Shark had pointed the gun at his head.

2294
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:19,240
He looked at the phone and the photo of Akiko.

2295
02:41:20,279 --> 02:41:23,319
Then he took a deep breath.

2296
02:41:23,319 --> 02:41:48,519
A couple of seconds later, he pressed 'Call'.
