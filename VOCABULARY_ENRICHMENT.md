# Vocabulary Enrichment Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced vocabulary structure for the `hardWord` field in the books database. The enrichment addresses the issue of inconsistent word formats (like `a.m./A.M./am/AM`) and provides comprehensive, dictionary-like information for each vocabulary word.

## Problem Statement

The original `hardWord` field had several issues:
1. **Inconsistent word formats**: Words appeared in multiple forms (e.g., `a.m.`, `A.M.`, `am`, `AM`)
2. **Truncated words**: Many words were cut off (e.g., `anarchis` instead of `anarchist`, `duches` instead of `duchess`)
3. **Limited information**: Only a simple comma-separated list with no definitions or context
4. **Not suitable for quiz/typing questions**: Lacked the structure needed for educational quizzes

## Solution: Enriched Vocabulary Structure

### New Structure Format

```json
{
  "hardWord": {
    "textAnalysis": {
      "uniqueWords": 680,
      "totalWords": 4175
    },
    "vocabulary": [
      {
        "word": "anarchist",
        "variants": ["anarchis"],
        "partOfSpeech": "noun",
        "definition": "a person who believes in or tries to bring about anarchy",
        "exampleSentence": "The anarchist refused to follow government rules.",
        "difficulty": "C1",
        "pronunciation": "/ˈænəkɪst/",
        "synonyms": ["rebel", "revolutionary", "insurgent"],
        "category": "politics"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `word` | string | Standardized form of the word (lowercase, base form) |
| `variants` | array | Alternative spellings or forms (including truncated versions) |
| `partOfSpeech` | string | Grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) |
| `definition` | string | Clear, concise meaning in context |
| `exampleSentence` | string | Usage example, ideally from the text |
| `difficulty` | string | CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) |
| `pronunciation` | string | IPA notation or simplified pronunciation |
| `synonyms` | array | Similar words |
| `category` | string | Semantic category (time, place, emotion, etc.) |

## Standardization Rules

### 1. Time Words

Use **lowercase with periods** as the standard:

| Standard | Variants |
|----------|----------|
| `a.m.` | A.M., am, AM |
| `p.m.` | P.M., pm, PM |
| `o'clock` | oclock, o clock |

### 2. Common Words

- **Use lowercase** unless it's a proper noun
- **Use singular form** as standard (e.g., `cat` not `cats`)
- **Use base verb form** (e.g., `run` not `running`, `ran`)

### 3. Spelling Consistency

- **American English** by default
- Example: `color` (not `colour`), `theater` (not `theatre`)

### 4. Truncated Words Correction

| Original (Truncated) | Corrected |
|---------------------|-----------|
| anarchis | anarchist |
| duches | duchess |
| headles | headless |
| painles | painless |
| aquariu | aquarium |
| ballroo | ballroom |
| jealou | jealous |

## Usage

### Processing Books

```bash
# Process a single book file
node enrich_vocabulary.js books.json books_enriched.json

# Test the enrichment
node test_enrichment.js
```

### Adding New Words to Dictionary

To add new words to the vocabulary dictionary:

1. Open `vocabulary_dictionary.json`
2. Add entry under `"words"`:

```json
{
  "words": {
    "yourword": {
      "variants": ["alternative"],
      "partOfSpeech": "noun",
      "definition": "clear definition",
      "exampleSentence": "example usage",
      "difficulty": "B1",
      "pronunciation": "/pronunciation/",
      "synonyms": ["synonym1", "synonym2"],
      "category": "appropriate-category"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits for Quiz/Typing Questions

The enriched structure enables:

1. **Consistent word presentation**: Always use the standardized form in quizzes
2. **Multiple choice questions**: Use variants and synonyms as distractors
3. **Contextual learning**: Provide definitions and examples
4. **Difficulty-based filtering**: Select words appropriate for learner level
5. **Pronunciation practice**: Include phonetic information
6. **Category-based quizzes**: Group words by semantic category

## Example Quiz Question Formats

### 1. Typing Quiz
```
Type the correct form:
"The meeting starts at 9 ___ (A.M./am/a.m./AM)"
Answer: a.m.
```

### 2. Definition Match

Run tests regularly:
```bash
npm test  # or node test_enrichment.js
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
