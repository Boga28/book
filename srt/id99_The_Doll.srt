CHAPTER ONE
The Doll

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,190
I remembered Jims description of the woman
who made her.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,870
How could a woman like that make a beautiful
doll?

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,550
My name is Stephen Amony and I am a doctor.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,289
I live and work in London, and I have a house
by the river Thames.

6
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,320
Everything in this story happened because
of a doll.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,110
It is a strange story, but true.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,870
It began on an October day three years ago...

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,879
I can remember it clearly.

10
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,789
The early morning sun was shining on the river
when I left my house.

11
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,230
I went to buy a copy of The Times, as usual.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,020
There was a flower shop on the corner of the
road where I lived.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,289
I could see the brightly-coloured flowers
as I reached the corner.

14
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,110
I turned into Abbey Lane and continued walking.

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,820
I was enjoying the warm October sun.

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,790
After a few minutes, I arrived at the newspaper
shop.

17
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,470
Suddenly, I remembered that it was a niece's
birthday the next week.

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,860
So I stopped and looked in the shop window.

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:32,690
There were games and toys, paper and pens,
books and sweets in the window.

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:39,660
'Most of it has been in that window for years,'
I thought to myself.

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,510
I almost decided that there was nothing in
the window for my niece.

22
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,909
Then I saw a doll.

23
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,740
She was half-hidden in the corner of the window.

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,780
She was made of cloth and she had a painted
face.

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,140
The face was special.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:06,600
It had a lovely gentle look, but sad eyes.

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Suddenly I felt sorry for her, sitting in
that crowded window.

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,700
I know that this sounds strange.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,519
But I decided to go inside and to look at
her more closely.

30
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,650
The shop was owned by a man named Jim Carter.

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,000
'Good morning, Doctor Amony!' he said brightly,
when I walked in.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,329
'Do you want The Times, as usual?'

33
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:39,400
'Yes, please, Jim,' I replied.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,889
'And I need a present for a little girl.

35
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,609
It's her birthday next week.'

36
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,700
'Is it?' said Jim.

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,560
'Yes,' I said.

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,660
'I was looking at that cloth doll in your
window.'

39
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,999
'Oh?' said Jim.

40
00:02:56,999 --> 00:03:02,579
'The one that's half-hidden in the corner,'
I said.

41
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,579
Jim looked surprised.

42
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,249
'That doll?' he said.

43
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:09,749
'She's a little unusual.'

44
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:12,540
'Can I see her?'

45
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,560
I said.

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,609
'She's also very expensive,' he said.

47
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:27,190
He took the doll from the window and gave
her to me - and I nearly dropped her in surprise.

48
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,269
She was beautifully made - she seemed almost
alive!

49
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:39,209
Her dress and other clothes were hand-made,
not made by a machine.

50
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:46,180
And her face was hand-painted - I could see
it clearly now.

51
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
'She's lovely!'

52
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,499
I thought.

53
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:52,269
'She was made with a lot of love.'

54
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,620
I could see this love in the doll's face.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,739
I put her down gently.

56
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,769
'How much do you want for her, Jim?'

57
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,819
I asked.

58
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,199
'Twelve pounds, Doctor Amony,' he answered.

59
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:16,480
He saw the surprise in my face and continued,
'She's expensive.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,070
I did say that, didn't I?'

61
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,130
'You did,' I agreed.

62
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:29,570
'Dolls like this cost as much as twenty pounds
in the centre of London,' said Jim.

63
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,100
'But I'll tell you what I'll do, doctor.

64
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,510
I'll sell her to you for eleven pounds.'

65
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,390
'Who makes them?'

66
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,390
I asked.

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:48,810
'I'd like to know something about the person
who can make beautiful dolls like this.'

68
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:56,610
'The woman has lived in Hardley Street for
some years now,' said Jim.

69
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,380
'She sometimes comes into my shop and she
brings me the dolls.'

70
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,880
'What's her name?'

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,190
I asked.

72
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,790
'I'm not sure,' Jim answered.

73
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,350
'It's something like "Callamy".'

74
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,850
'What's she like?'

75
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,550
I said.

76
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:29,760
'She's a tall woman with red hair, and she
wears very expensive coats and hats,' replied

77
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Jim.

78
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,750
'But she's got a very serious face.

79
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,530
She never says very much when she comes into
the shop.

80
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm honestly always glad when she leaves.'

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:51,610
He stopped for a minute and then said, 'And
I've never seen her smile.'

82
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,250
I couldn't understand this.

83
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,500
How could a woman like that make dolls as
beautiful as these?

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,470
'I'll buy the doll,' I said at last.

85
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,520
Eleven pounds seemed a lot of money for a
doll.

86
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,250
As I counted out the pound notes, I felt a
little silly.

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,770
Yes, the doll was a present.

88
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,620
But I knew the real reason for buying her
- I didn't want to leave her in that shop

89
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,700
window.

90
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,110
I took the doll home and put her in my small
bedroom.

91
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,120
She seemed to fill the room with her loveliness.

92
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,750
I carefully put her into a box.

93
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,950
Then I covered the box with brown paper.

94
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:53,420
Later, in the afternoon, I went to the post
office and posted it to my niece.

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:00,890
In the following days, I could not stop thinking
about the doll, or about the gentle face and

96
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,420
the sad eyes.

97
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,830
I remembered Jim's description of the woman
who made her.

98
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,100
How could a woman like that make a beautiful
doll?

99
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,220
It was difficult to believe.

100
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,670
So who was she?

101
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,700
I wanted to know, but the weather got cold
and wet.

102
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,080
Children in the area became ill, and I was
suddenly very busy.

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,300
I soon forgot about the woman - and the doll.

104
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,670
One day, a few weeks later, my telephone rang.

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,720
A woman's voice said, 'Is that Doctor Amony?'

106
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,920
'Yes, it is,' I said.

107
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,720
'Do you visit people who can pay for your
visit?'

108
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,460
the woman asked.

109
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,880
'Yes, sometimes,' I replied.

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,370
'How much does it cost?'

111
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,400
she asked.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
The voice sounded unpleasant.

113
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,100
The woman seemed to think that money was more
important than the sick person.

114
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:20,080
A visit will cost five pounds,' I replied.

115
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,180
'Oh,' she said.

116
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,530
'But if you really can't pay, then I don't
ask for the money,' I said.

117
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,740
'That's all right,' she said.

118
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,460
'I can pay five pounds.'

119
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,490
'What's your name?'

120
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,500
I asked.

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
'Rose Callamit,' she answered.

122
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,279
'I live in the house next to the cake shop
in Hardley Street.

123
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,840
My rooms are on the second floor.'

124
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,110
'I'll be there soon,' I told her.

125
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,370
I arrived at the house next to the cake shop
in Hardley Street ten minutes later, and went

126
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,640
up the stairs.

127
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,400
They were narrow, dirty, and badly lit.

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,790
As I reached the top of the stairs, a door
opened.

129
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,560
'Doctor Amony?' said the unpleasant voice.

130
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,910
'Yes,' I said.

131
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,590
'Please come in,' she said.

132
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,680
'I'm Rose Callamit.'

133
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,080
She was a tall woman, between forty-five and
fifty years old.

134
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,440
She had red hair, dark eyes and a bright shiny-red
mouth.

135
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,430
We went into the front room.

136
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:51,150
It was a cold, ugly room, and the furniture
was cheap and badly made.

137
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,570
On the cupboard in the corner were a lot of
small glass bottles.

138
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,580
Then I saw the dolls.

139
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,520
They were hanging from the walls and were
thrown carelessly across the bed.

140
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,420
Each doll was different, but each one was
as beautiful as my doll.

141
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:20,130
It seemed impossible that this rough, unpleasant
woman could make them.

142
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,390
Rose Callamit looked closely at me.

143
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,620
'You're a very young doctor,' she said.

144
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,340
'I'm older than I look,' I said coldly.

145
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,060
'You think that I'm too young.

146
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,000
Shall I go away again?'

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,080
She laughed at me.

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,520
'You don't need to be angry, doctor!'

149
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,540
she said.

150
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,360
'You're very good-looking for a doctor.'

151
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,320
'And I'm a very busy doctor,' I said.

152
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,550
'Are you the person who's ill?'

153
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,410
'No, it's my niece,' she replied.

154
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,850
'She's in the back room.

155
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,380
I'll take you to her.'

156
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,110
Before we went in, I had to know about the
dolls.

157
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,970
'Do you make these dolls?'

158
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,100
I asked.

159
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,960
'Yes,' she replied.

160
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
'Why?'

161
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,310
I felt very sad.

162
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:32,310
'I bought one for someone's birthday,' I said
quietly.

163
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,490
She laughed.

164
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:41,130
'And I'm sure that you paid a lot of money
for it,' she said.

165
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,970
She took me to a smaller room at the back
and started to open the door.

166
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,080
'Mary, it's the doctor!'

167
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,010
she shouted.

168
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:58,090
Then she pushed the door open wider to let
me in.

169
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,500
'Don't be surprised when you see her, doctor,'
she said loudly.

170
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,029
'Her left leg is twisted!'

171
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,040
The girl, Mary, was sitting in a chair by
the window.

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,050
She heard the woman's words.

173
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:22,310
A look of unhappiness crossed her pale face,
and there was pain in her large dark eyes.

174
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,160
I was angry at the red-haired woman.

175
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,839
The words were unnecessary.

176
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,630
She wanted to hurt the girl.

177
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,570
Mary was not more than twenty-five years old.

178
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:41,100
But I could see immediately that she was very
ill.

179
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,910
I looked again into those dark eyes.

180
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,980
'Something inside her is dying,' I thought.

181
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:57,870
After that first visit I always remembered
the sweetness in her sad face, her poor, thin

182
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,620
body and her dry, unhealthy hair.

183
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,400
But something filled me with happiness.

184
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,240
Around her were three small tables - and on
them were all the necessary things to make

185
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,740
the dolls!

186
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:22,390
Brightly-coloured paints, and pieces of cloth
of many different colours and shapes.

187
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:29,550
I soon understood that her twisted leg was
not the reason for her illness.

188
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,820
I noticed the way that she sat.

189
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,180
If I was right, I could make that leg straight.

190
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,790
I was almost sure that I was right.

191
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,740
'Can you walk, Mary?'

192
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,880
I asked after a minute.

193
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,610
She looked at me, then looked away.

194
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,920
'Yes,' she answered, quietly.

195
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,540
Please walk to me,' I said, gently

196
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,540
'Oh, don't,' she said.

197
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,279
'Don't ask me that.'

198
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,959
I didn't want her to suffer.

199
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,020
But I had to be sure that I was right.

200
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,959
'I'm sorry, Mary,' I said.

201
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,640
'Please try and walk.

202
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,110
It's important.'

203
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:25,300
She got up from her chair very carefully and
moved slowly towards me.

204
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,029
I looked closely at her left leg.

205
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,510
Yes, I was right!

206
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,990
"That's good,' I said.

207
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,209
I smiled at her.

208
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,800
I wanted to show her that I was pleased.

209
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,550
I held out my hands to help her.

210
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,800
She looked up.

211
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,490
Again, I saw the pain and hopelessness in
her face.

212
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,740
She seemed to be crying out silently to me
for help.

213
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,089
She lifted her hands towards mine - and then
they fell back to her sides.

214
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,520
'How long have you been like this, Mary?'

215
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,990
I asked.

216
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,490
Rose Callamit answered for the girl.

217
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,320
'Oh, Mary's had that twisted leg for nearly
ten years now,' she said.

218
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,620
'But I asked you to come for a different reason.

219
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,480
She's ill.

220
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,160
I want to know what's wrong with her.'

221
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,490
'Oh, yes, she's ill,' I thought.

222
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,110
'Perhaps she's dying.

223
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,890
I knew that immediately.'

224
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,120
I wanted Rose Callamit to leave the room,
but she didn't.

225
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,499
She laughed and said, 'I'm staying here, Doctor
Amony.

226
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,210
You look at Mary.

227
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:52,680
Then you can tell me what the problem is.'

228
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,840
When I finished my examination of Mary, I
went with Rose into the front room.

229
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,200
'It's possible to make her leg straight,'
I said.

230
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,870
'Did you know that?

231
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,709
With help, she could walk in-'

232
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,050
'Stop!'

233
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,090
she shouted loudly.

234
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,279
I jumped.

235
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,800
'That's enough!

236
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,830
You must never say anything about that to
her.

237
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,589
The best doctors cannot help her.

238
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,980
No stupid young man is going to give her hope.

239
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,890
If you ever do, you won't come here again.

240
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,440
I want to know what's wrong with her.

241
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,340
She can't eat or sleep and she isn't really
working.

242
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,260
Now, tell me.

243
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,250
What did you learn from your examination of
her?'

244
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,310
'I don't know what's wrong with her yet,'
I replied.

245
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,450
'But something is slowly destroying her, I
know that.

246
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,300
I shall want to see her again, soon.

247
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,900
I'm going to give her some medicine - it will
make her feel stronger.

248
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Then I'll call again in a few days.'

249
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,600
'Don't say anything about making her leg straight,'
she said.

250
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,140
'Do you understand?

251
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,959
If you do, I'll get another doctor.'

252
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,920
'All right,' I said.

253
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,970
I wanted to be able to visit Mary again, and
I thought to myself, 'Perhaps, when Mary's

254
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,809
feeling better, I can talk to her about her
leg.'

255
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,660
I was ready to leave.

256
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,520
I picked up my bag.

257
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,750
'These dolls,' I said.

258
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,750
'Yes?'

259
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,600
she said.

260
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,180
'I thought that you made them,' I said.

261
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,490
'I do,' she said, in her unpleasant way.

262
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,980
'I draw them.

263
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,590
Mary makes them.

264
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,420
It stops her thinking about her leg.

265
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,970
I don't want her to think about the fact that
she'll never marry.

266
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,679
She'll never have children.'

267
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,520
I walked out into the bright October sunshine.

268
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,230
I knew that Rose Callamit was lying.

269
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,640
I now knew the sweet person who made those
special dolls.

270
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,260
I was happy about this, but I was also worried
about Mary.

271
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,960
I had to discover what was wrong with her.

272
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,860
I had to know before she died.

273
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:48,610
CHAPTER TWO
The Doll

274
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,830
'Without Mary and the dolls, the money will
end.'

275
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,610
But what was killing Mary?

276
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,320
I still did not know.

277
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,020
I discovered more about Mary during my next
few visits.

278
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,720
Her name was Mary Nolan.

279
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,210
When she was fifteen years old, she was in
a bad car crash.

280
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,330
Her mother and father were killed and Mary
was very badly hurt.

281
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,090
The car crash was the reason for her twisted
leg.

282
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,710
Rose Callamit offered to look after Mary.

283
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:35,930
The law finally agreed because there was no
other person to look after the young girl.

284
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,549
Rose always thought that Mary s father was
a rich man.

285
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:45,820
Then she learned that there was only a small
amount of money.

286
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,679
After that she was unkind to Mary.

287
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,110
She made her very unhappy.

288
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,660
Mary was never able to forget her leg.

289
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,380
Her aunt seemed to say: 'No man will love
you.

290
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,110
You will never get married and have children.

291
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,460
No man wants a wife with a twisted leg.'

292
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:16,070
The years passed, and Mary began to believe
her aunt.

293
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,130
She stayed with her.

294
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,570
She did what her aunt wanted her to do.

295
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,500
She could see no reason to leave her aunt.

296
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,169
So she lived an unhappy life, without hope.

297
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:35,090
Then Mary started to make the dolls.

298
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,640
Rose Callamit saw how lovely the dolls were.

299
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,650
She soon realized that she could sell them
for a lot of money.

300
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,550
She was right.

301
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,490
After she sold a few, she decided.

302
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:57,540
Mary must work on them every day of the week,
from morning until night.

303
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:05,179
Rose did not love Mary, but the girl produced
hundreds of dolls over the years.

304
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:07,870
Rose was happy to take the money for them.

305
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:15,890
But now Mary was ill and Rose immediately
said to herself, 'Without Mary and the dolls,

306
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,960
the money will end.'

307
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,150
But what was killing Mary?

308
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,010
I still did not know.

309
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,230
I could see that she was afraid of her aunt.

310
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,530
But it wasn't that.

311
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:36,470
And I couldn't ask Mary, because her aunt
was always with us.

312
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:42,470
Mary found it difficult to say anything to
me with Rose in the room.

313
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,720
I did not tell Mary that perhaps I could make
her leg straight.

314
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,750
It was more important to discover why she
didn't want to continue living.

315
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:02,840
I told Mary to stop working on the dolls,
and I brought her some books and some chocolates.

316
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,240
For ten days she seemed to get better.

317
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,900
During my next visit, she smiled at me for
the first time.

318
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
'That's better!'

319
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
I said.

320
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,340
I was very pleased to see her happy face.

321
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,450
'You must leave the dolls alone for another
ten days.

322
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,100
I don't want you to work.

323
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,860
I want you to rest, sleep and read.

324
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,280
Then we'll see.'

325
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,809
But I could see that Rose was unhappy at these
words.

326
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,760
When I called again, she was waiting for me
in her room.

327
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,080
'You don't need to come any more, Doctor Amony,'
she said, coldly.

328
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,750
'But Mary must not-' I started to say.

329
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,110
'Mary is much better now,' she said quickly.

330
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,460
'Goodbye, doctor.'

331
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,790
My eyes went to the box in the corner of the
room.

332
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:09,460
There were three new dolls lying on top of
it.

333
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:16,650
Their faces were as lovely as ever, but they
had the look of death on them.

334
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,730
Suddenly I was frightened for Mary.

335
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,210
I knew that Rose Callamit was lying.

336
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:29,200
I wanted to push this woman out of the way
and crash through the door and see Mary.

337
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,030
But I was a doctor.

338
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,010
When doctors are told to leave, they have
to go.

339
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,800
I still did not know what Mary's problem was.

340
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,630
But I guessed that Rose was asking another
doctor to call.

341
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,980
So, sadly, I left.

342
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,299
But I couldn't forget Mary.

343
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:57,000
I continued to worry about her in the days
that followed.

344
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,809
Not long after this I became ill.

345
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,080
It wasn't much at first.

346
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,880
But as the days passed it seemed to get worse.

347
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,460
I visited a doctor friend.

348
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,450
'I can find nothing wrong with your body,'
he said.

349
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,049
'Perhaps you work too hard.'

350
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:23,760
But I knew that this wasn't the reason.

351
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,490
I continued to get worse.

352
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,330
I didn't want to eat and I lost weight.

353
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,559
I began to look thin and pale.

354
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,230
I felt tired, but I didn't sleep well at night.

355
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,020
I sometimes dreamed that I saw Mary.

356
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:49,960
She was calling to me for help, while Rose
Callamit was holding her in her ugly arms.

357
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,190
I thought about Mary all the time.

358
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,340
'I wasn't able to help her,' I thought.

359
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,750
'She wanted me to help her and I did nothing.'

360
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,350
One night I couldn't sleep at all.

361
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:11,110
I walked up and down my room, thinking about
myself and my illness.

362
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:17,580
It seemed that I was suffering from the same
illness as Mary.

363
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,930
Suddenly I knew what was wrong.

364
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,380
I was in love with Mary Nolan!

365
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,940
And because I couldn't look after her, I felt
ill and unhappy.

366
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,050
'I know why Mary's dying!'

367
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,870
I thought.

368
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,799
'She's dying because nobody loves her.

369
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,720
Nobody in the world is giving her hope for
the future.

370
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,080
Her mother and father are dead.

371
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,210
Her aunt only keeps her because she makes
money from Mary's dolls.

372
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:57,510
Mary has no friends and she feels ugly because
of her leg.

373
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,090
Her life is empty - except for the dolls.

374
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,160
'I have to see her!

375
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:12,419
I have to speak to her for a few minutes,
alone - or she'll be lost to me forever!'

376
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:19,450
I thought about this all through the night,
and the next morning I telephoned Jim Carter

377
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,039
at his shop.

378
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,570
'This is Doctor Amony, Jim,' I said.

379
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,450
'Will you help me?'

380
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,610
'I'll do what I can for you, doctor,' Jim
said.

381
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:38,410
'You saved my son's life last year, and I'll
never forget that.

382
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,330
How can I help you?'

383
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,320
'Thanks, Jim,' I said.

384
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,610
'Do you remember Mrs Rose Callamit, the doll
woman?'

385
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,160
'Yes, of course,' said Jim.

386
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,130
'When she comes into your shop again, I want
you to telephone me.

387
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,580
Then have a long conversation with her,' I
said.

388
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,470
'I need twenty minutes.

389
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,470
All right?'

390
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,010
'All right,' said Jim.

391
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,830
'Good,' I said.

392
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,380
'Thanks, Jim.

393
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,260
I'll remember this for the rest of my life.'

394
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,850
I was worried about a telephone call while
I was out.

395
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,030
So each evening I put my head round the door
of his shop.

396
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,760
But he just shook his head.

397
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,309
There was no news.

398
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:36,070
Then one day, at five o'clock in the afternoon,
the telephone rang.

399
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,290
It was Jim.

400
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,160
He just said, 'She's here.'

401
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,100
I ran to the house where Mary lived.

402
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,110
When I got there, I ran up the stairs.

403
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:54,120
Luckily, the door was not locked, and I hurried
through into Mary's room.

404
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,520
She looked so thin now, and very ill.

405
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,049
She still had the paints and pieces of cloth
around her.

406
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:08,960
I thought, 'She wants to make one more doll
before she dies.'

407
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,390
She looked up when I came into the room.

408
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,770
Her eyes opened wide in surprise when she
saw me.

409
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,679
She thought that it was Rose.

410
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,700
She said my name.

411
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,419
But she didn't call me 'Doctor Amony' - she
called me 'Stephen'.

412
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,620
'Mary!'

413
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
I cried.

414
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
'I've come to help you.

415
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,350
I know what's making you ill.'

416
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,590
'Does it matter now?'

417
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,210
she said, quietly.

418
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,299
'There's still time, Mary,' I said.

419
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,790
'I know your secret.

420
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,210
I know how I can make you well.

421
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,830
But you must listen to me while I tell you.'

422
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,600
She just closed her eyes and said, quietly,
'No.

423
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,059
Don't say anything, please.

424
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,559
Leave me.

425
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,320
I don't want to know.

426
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,620
The end is near now.'

427
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,240
I sat down and held her hand.

428
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,980
'Mary, please listen to me,' I said gently.

429
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,160
'When children are growing up, they receive
love from their family.

430
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,870
Then, when they're older, they can give that
love to other people.

431
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:33,620
They give love, and at the same time they
receive kindness, happiness and hope.

432
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,700
Then they have more love that they can give.

433
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,590
But you've given your love, Mary, and you've
received nothing.

434
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:48,030
Now you have no love that you can give.'

435
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,800
I was not sure that she could still hear me.

436
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,100
But I wanted her to live so much.

437
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,830
I had to continue.

438
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,020
'It was your aunt,' I said.

439
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,450
'She took away all your hopes for love and
happiness.

440
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:08,830
And later,' I continued, 'she did a worse
thing.

441
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,130
She took away your children.'

442
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,080
I looked at Mary.

443
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,059
'Have I killed her?'

444
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,070
I thought.

445
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,390
'The one person who loves her?'

446
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:30,799
Then I felt her small hand move in mine and
her eyes slowly opened.

447
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,429
She seemed almost glad to hear these words.

448
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,470
This gave me hope.

449
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,290
I talked gently.

450
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,659
I tried very hard, because I wanted her to
understand.

451
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:50,870
'Those dolls were your children, Mary,' I
said.

452
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,110
'You thought that you couldn't be a mother.

453
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,350
So you made those beautiful dolls.

454
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,179
Into each one you put some of your love.

455
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:08,030
You made them gently and carefully, and you
loved them like your own children.

456
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:15,490
'Then your aunt took each one away and she
gave you nothing.

457
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,460
You continued to use all your love.

458
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,659
People can die when they have no love left
inside them, Mary.'

459
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:30,220
I finished speaking and she moved.

460
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,420
She seemed to understand what I was saying.

461
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:40,600
'But you won't die, Mary,' I cried, 'because
I love you!

462
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,690
Do you hear me?

463
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,180
I love you and I can't live without you.'

464
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,049
'Love me?'

465
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:50,190
she said quietly.

466
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,790
'But I have a twisted leg.

467
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,450
How can you love me?'

468
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,620
'That doesn't matter to me, Mary.

469
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,090
I still love you,' I said, gently.

470
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,400
'But Rose lied to you.

471
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,230
I can make your leg straight.

472
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,830
In a year you'll walk like every other girl.'

473
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,960
I saw tears of happiness in her eyes.

474
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,530
She smiled and put her arms out to me.

475
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,909
I took her up in my arms and she held me.

476
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:29,960
I put my coat round her to keep her warm.

477
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,120
Then I carried her across the room.

478
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,300
Suddenly we heard the front door shut and
the sound of running footsteps.

479
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:47,190
Then Mary's door crashed open as an angry
Rose Callamit came into the room.

480
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,180
Mary started to shake with fear.

481
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,660
She hid her face in my neck.

482
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,750
But Rose was too late.

483
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,970
She could do nothing now, and she knew it.

484
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,830
She did not speak a word when I walked past
her.

485
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,460
I held Mary close to me.

486
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,330
I went out of her front door, down the stairs
and into the street.

487
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:18,340
Outside, the sun shone and the sky was blue.

488
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:27,090
Children played happily and noisily in the
street as I carried Mary home.

489
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,120
That was three years ago.

490
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,809
As I write this, Mary is playing with our
son.

491
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:39,870
Our second child will arrive in a few weeks.

492
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,820
Mary doesn't make the dolls now.

493
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,070
She doesn't need to make them.

494
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:53,700
But I silently thank the day when I first
fell in love with the beautiful doll in Jim

495
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,429
Carter's shop window.

496
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:55,889
- THE END -
