CHAPTER ONE
The Mermaid

2
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,700
Every evening the fisherman went out fishing.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,090
He sometimes sold his fish at the market.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,470
Sometimes he did not catch many fish and he
could not sell them.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,119
One evening his net was very heavy.

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,189
He laughed and said, 'Did I catch all the
fish in the sea?

7
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,130
Or did I catch some horrible monster?

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,760
I will give it to the Queen.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,859
She will be happy.'

10
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:43,730
He pulled and pulled the heavy net.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,309
Finally, he pulled the net next to the boat.

12
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,469
But there were no fish in it and there was
no monster.

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,640
There was only a little mermaid.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,300
She was asleep.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:08,520
Her hair was yellow like gold; her body was
white like ivory; her tail like silver and

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,230
pearl; and her ears like seashells.

17
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,190
She was very beautiful.

18
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,940
The fisherman pulled the net closer to the
boat.

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,040
He embraced her.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,500
When he touched her, she screamed.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,380
She could not escape so she began to cry and
said, 'Please let me go.

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,020
I am the only daughter of a King of the Sea.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,610
My father is very old and alone.'

24
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:51,510
But the fisherman answered her, 'I will let
you go, but you must make me a promise.

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,420
I will call you and you will come and sing
to me.

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,100
The fish love the songs of the people of the
sea.

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,590
You will sing and my nets will be full.'

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,390
'I promise.

29
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,630
Please let me go,' cried the mermaid.

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,920
'Yes, I will let you go,' said the fisherman.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,520
So she promised him and he let her go.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,570
She went back into the sea and trembled.

33
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,590
She felt a strange fear.

34
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,480
Every evening the young fisherman went fishing
and called the mermaid.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,070
She came and sang to him.

36
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,310
The dolphins swam round and round her.

37
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,540
The seagulls were in the sky above her head.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,110
She sang a marvellous song of the tritons,
the men with long green beards.

39
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,650
She sang of the gardens of the sea with their
corals.

40
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,350
Here the fish swim like silver birds.

41
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:08,170
She sang of the big whales from the cold north
seas, and of the dead sailors in their ships

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,630
at the bottom of the sea.

43
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,680
She sang of the little children.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,510
They ride on the backs of the dolphins and
laugh.

45
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,500
When she sang the tuna fish came to listen
to her.

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,240
The young fisherman then caught many of them.

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,240
When his boat was full of fish, the mermaid
smiled at him and swam away.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,290
But she never came near him.

49
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,440
When he tried to catch her, she went into
the water like a seal.

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,580
Each day her voice became sweeter to his ears.

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,550
Soon he forgot his nets and listened to her
song.

52
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,910
He listened to her until the moon came.

53
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:09,150
One evening he called her, and said, 'Little
mermaid, marry me because I love you.'

54
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,040
But the little mermaid said, 'You have a human
soul.

55
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,769
Send away your soul, and then I can love you.'

56
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,139
The young fisherman thought, 'Why do I need
my soul?

57
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,590
I cannot see it.

58
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,180
I cannot touch it.

59
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,860
I do not know it.

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,629
Of course I will send it away and I will be
very happy.'

61
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,069
He stood up in his boat and cried, 'I will
send my soul away!

62
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:49,199
You will be my wife, and you will show me
all the things you sing about.

63
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,860
We will be together forever.'

64
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,410
The little mermaid laughed because she was
very happy.

65
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,039
'But how can I send my soul away?'

66
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,770
cried the young fisherman.

67
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,430
'I do not know,' said the little mermaid.

68
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,490
'The people of the sea have no souls.'

69
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:24,520
Early the next morning the fisherman went
to the priest's house and knocked on his door.

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,900
The priest looked out of the window and saw
the fisherman and said, 'Come in.'

71
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:40,759
The young fisherman entered and cried to the
priest, 'Father, I am in love with a mermaid.

72
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,139
I cannot marry her because I have a soul.

73
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,949
How can I send my soul away?

74
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,550
I really do not need it.

75
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,400
Why is my soul important?

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,069
I cannot see it.

77
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,530
I cannot touch it.

78
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,020
I do not know it.'

79
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,389
The priest answered, 'Are you mad?

80
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,689
God gave you your soul.

81
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,800
It is very precious.

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,210
It is as precious as all the gold in the world.

83
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,819
So, my son, do not think about this any more.

84
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,050
It is the worst sin.

85
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,699
The people of the sea are lost creatures.

86
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,159
They are like the beasts of the fields.

87
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,979
They do not know what is right and wrong.

88
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,680
God didn't die for them.'

89
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:50,309
The young fisherman began to cry and said,
'Father, the fauns live in the forest and

90
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,360
are happy.

91
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,410
The mermen sit on the rocks with their gold
harps.

92
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,879
I want to be like them.

93
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,020
'Why is my soul important?

94
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:09,159
I have a soul, but I cannot have the mermaid,
and I love her,' he cried.

95
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:13,930
'It is horrible to love your body!'

96
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,229
cried the priest.

97
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:20,349
'The fauns of the woods and the mermen are
horrible!

98
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:21,749
I hear them at night.

99
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:26,159
They try to distract me from my prayers.

100
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,509
They are lost, I tell you, they are lost.

101
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,129
There is no heaven or hell for them.'

102
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,129
'Away!

103
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,129
Away!'

104
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,129
cried the priest.

105
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,849
'Your mermaid is lost and you will be lost
with her.'

106
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:45,370
The young fisherman walked sadly to the marketplace.

107
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,550
When the merchants saw him they said, 'What
do you want to sell?'

108
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,449
'I will sell you my soul,' he answered.

109
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,860
'Please buy it from me because I am tired
of it.

110
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,639
What can I do with a soul?

111
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,759
I cannot see it.

112
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,749
I cannot touch it.

113
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,020
I do not know it.'

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,680
But the merchants laughed at him, and said,
'What can we do with a soul?

115
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,499
A false coin is more precious.

116
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:21,399
Sell us your body, and we will give you a
lot of gold.

117
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,889
But we will not give you any money for your
soul.'

118
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,879
The young fisherman thought, 'How strange
this is!

119
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:36,140
The priest said, "Your soul is as precious
as all the gold in the world."

120
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,320
But the merchants say, "A false coin is more
precious.'"

121
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,880
He went to the beach and began to think.

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
CHAPTER TWO
The Witch

123
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
At midday he remembered that there was a young
witch.

124
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
She lived in a cave and she was very good
at magic.

125
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
He ran quickly to her.

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
'What do you need?

127
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
What do you need?'

128
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
she cried, when he ran towards her cave.

129
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
'Do you need fish when the weather is bad?

130
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I have a special instrument.

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
You play it and all the fish swim into the
bay.

132
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.

133
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
'What do you need?

134
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
What do you need?

135
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
A storm to destroy the ships?

136
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Do you want the gold on the ships?

137
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
I can help you.

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
I have more storms than the wind.

139
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
My master is stronger than the wind.

140
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
But I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price.'

141
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
'I do not want very much,' said the young
fisherman, 'but the priest is very angry with

142
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
me, and the merchants laugh at me.

143
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
So, I came to you, and I will pay you any
price.'

144
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
'What do you want?' asked the witch.

145
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
'I want to send my soul away from me,' answered
the young fisherman.

146
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
The witch's face became white.

147
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
'Pretty boy, pretty boy,' she said, 'that
is a terrible thing to do.'

148
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
He laughed and answered her, 'My soul is not
important to me.

149
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
I cannot see it.

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I cannot touch it.

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
I do not know it.'

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
'I will tell you, but you must give me something,'
said the witch.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
She looked at him with her beautiful eyes.

154
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
'Five pieces of gold,' he said, 'and my nets
and my house, and my boat.

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
But how can I send away my soul?'

156
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
She laughed and answered, 'I can change the
autumn leaves into gold.

157
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
I can change the light of the moon into silver.

158
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
My master is richer than all the kings of
this world.'

159
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
The witch caressed his hair with her thin
white hand.

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
'You must dance with me, pretty boy,' she
said softly, and she smiled at him.

161
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
'Only this?'

162
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
cried the young fisherman.

163
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
'Only this,' she answered, and she smiled
at him again.

164
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
'Then we will dance together in a secret place
at sunset,' he said, 'and you will tell me

165
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
everything.

166
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Then I can send away my soul.'

167
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
'When the moon is full, when the moon is full,'
she said softly.

168
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Then she looked around and listened.

169
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Three birds sang.

170
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
There was no other sound.

171
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
There was only the sound of the waves.

172
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
So she pulled him next to her.

173
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
She put her dry lips close to his ear.

174
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
'Tonight you must come to the top of the mountain,'
she whispered.

175
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
'It is a special night and He will be there.'

176
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
'Who is He?' he asked.

177
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
'It is not important,' she answered.

178
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
'Go tonight and stand under the tree, and
wait for me.

179
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
You will see a dog, and you must hit it with
a stick.

180
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
The dog will run away.

181
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Remember, do not speak to the owl.

182
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
I will come with the full moon, and we will
dance together.'

183
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
'How can I send my soul away?

184
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
You must promise to tell me,' he said.

185
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
She came out of the cave into the sun.

186
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
T promise,' she answered.

187
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
'You are the best witch in the world,' cried
the fisherman, and he ran back to the town

188
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
happily.

189
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
The witch went into her cave, and burned a
magic plant.

190
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
She looked into the smoke.

191
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
After some time she said angrily, 'He must
be mine.

192
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
I am as beautiful as she is.'

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
That evening, when the moon appeared, the
fisherman went to the top of the mountain.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
He stood under the tree.

195
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
A big owl with yellow eyes called his name.

196
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
He did not answer.

197
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
A black dog ran towards him.

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
He hit it with the stick, and it ran away.

199
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
At midnight the witches were in the sky.

200
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
They were like bats.

201
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
'Phew!'

202
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
they cried when they came to the ground, 'there
is someone here and we do not know him!'

203
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Finally, the young witch with red hair appeared.

204
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
She wore a gold dress with peacock's eyes
on it and her little hat was green.

205
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
'Where is he, where is he?' asked the witches
when they saw her.

206
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
She laughed and ran to the fisherman.

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
She took him by the hand and then they danced
in the moonlight.

208
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
They danced round and round.

209
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Then they heard the sound of a galloping horse,
but they did not see a horse.

210
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
'Faster, faster!'

211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
she cried, and then the fisherman was afraid.

212
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Something very bad was there and he was afraid
of it.

213
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
There was a man near a rock.

214
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
He wore elegant Spanish clothes.

215
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
This man watched the fisherman constantly.

216
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
The witch laughed, and he danced with her
round and round.

217
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
CHAPTER THREE
The Secret

218
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
A dog barked and the dancers stopped.

219
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
They went to the man, and kissed his hand.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
'Come!

221
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Let's pray,' the witch said softly.

222
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
The fisherman wanted to do this, and he followed
her.

223
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
But when he came near the man, he called God's
name.

224
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
When he did this, the witches screamed and
went away.

225
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
A horse came and the man got on it.

226
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
He looked at the fisherman sadly, and then
disappeared.

227
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
The witch with red hair tried to fly away
too, but the fisherman stopped her.

228
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
'Let me go,' she cried.

229
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
'You must not say God's name.'

230
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
'No,' he answered, 'You are my prisoner.

231
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Tell me the secret now.'

232
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
'What secret?' said the witch.

233
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
She tried to escape.

234
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
'You know,' he answered.

235
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
She began to cry and said to the fisherman,
'Ask me anything, but not that!'

236
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
He laughed, and didn't want to release her.

237
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
She could not escape and so she said, 'I am
as beautiful as the mermaids,' and she put

238
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
her face near his.

239
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
But he pushed her away and said, 'I will kill
you.

240
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
You must tell me the secret now.'

241
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
She trembled.

242
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
'All right,' she said.

243
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
'It is your soul, not mine.'

244
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
She gave him a little knife.

245
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
'Why did you give me this knife?' he asked.

246
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
She was silent for a moment.

247
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
She was terrified.

248
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Then she said to him, 'Our shadow is not the
shadow of our bodies.

249
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
It is the body of our souls.

250
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Stand on the beach with your back to the moon.

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Cut your shadow from your feet.

252
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Then you must tell your soul to leave and
it will leave.'

253
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
The young fisherman trembled.

254
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
'Is this true?' he said.

255
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
He released her and took the knife.

256
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Then he walked to the sea.

257
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
The fisherman's soul then said to him, 'I
am your servant.

258
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Do not send me away now.

259
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Did I do anything bad to you?'

260
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
The young fisherman laughed.

261
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
'You didn't do anything bad, but I do not
need you,' he answered.

262
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
'The world is big.

263
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Go where you want.

264
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
But do not disturb me because my love is calling
me.'

265
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
His soul called him many times, but he did
not listen.

266
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
He then arrived on the beach and stood on
the sand with his back to the moon.

267
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
White arms came out of the foam and they asked
him to come.

268
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
His soul said to him, 'Do not send me away
without a heart.

269
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
The world is cruel.

270
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Give me your heart.'

271
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
'How can I love my mermaid without a heart?'
he cried.

272
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
'Please,' said his soul, 'give me your heart.

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
The world is cruel and I am afraid.'

274
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
'My heart is with my love now,' he answered.

275
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
'Go away.'

276
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
'But I also need to love,' said his soul.

277
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
'Go away.

278
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I do not need you!'

279
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
cried the young fisherman.

280
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
He took the little knife and cut his shadow
from his feet.

281
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
The shadow stood up in front of him, and it
was very similar to the fisherman.

282
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
The fisherman moved back slowly, and he was
afraid.

283
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
'Go away!' he murmured, 'and never come back
again.'

284
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
'No, but we must meet again,' said the soul.

285
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
The soul's voice was like a flute.

286
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
'How will we meet?'

287
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
cried the young fisherman.

288
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
'Will you follow me into the sea?'

289
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
'Once every year I will come to this place,
and call you,' said the soul.

290
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
'Perhaps you will need me.'

291
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
'I do not think I will need you,' cried the
young fisherman, 'but you can call me.

292
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I can come here again.'

293
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
He went into the water, and the tritons played
their musical instruments.

294
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
The little mermaid came to meet him.

295
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
She put her arms around his neck and kissed
him on the mouth.

296
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
The soul stood on the beach and watched them.

297
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
And when they disappeared into the sea, the
fisherman's soul walked away and cried.

298
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
CHAPTER FOUR
The Soul's First Journey

299
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
After a year, the soul came down to the sea
and called the young fisherman.

300
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
He came out of the sea, and said, 'Why do
you call me?'

301
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
The soul answered, 'Come nearer.

302
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I want to speak to you because I saw marvellous
things.'

303
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
So he came nearer, and sat in the water and
listened.

304
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
The soul said to him, 'When I left you, I
went towards the East and travelled.

305
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Everything wise comes from the East.

306
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
After six days I came to the land of the Tartars.

307
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
One night I saw a fire in a camp of a company
of merchants.

308
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I went to them and the chief of merchants
stood up and took his sword.

309
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
'"Who are you?" he asked.

310
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
'"I am a Prince and I escaped from the Tartars,"
I replied.

311
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
'He lowered his head as a sign of respect
and took my hand.

312
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
'Then we left the country of the Tartars and
we travelled in many strange lands and saw

313
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
many strange people.

314
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I travelled on a camel next to the chief.

315
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
There were forty camels in the caravan and
eighty mules.

316
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
'During our journey we battled with the tribe
of the Magadae.

317
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
They are born old and grow younger every year,
and die when they are little children.

318
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
We battled with the Laktroi.

319
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
They think they are the sons of tigers, and
they paint their bodies yellow and black.

320
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
We also battled with the Sibians.

321
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
They have horses' feet and they run quicker
than horses.

322
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
'In the fourth month we arrived in the city
of Illel.

323
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
It was night and we waited for day to come.

324
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
That morning we knocked at the gate of the
city.

325
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
The gate was of red bronze and it had images
of sea-dragons and dragons with wings.

326
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
'A guard then said to us, "What do you want?"

327
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
"'We are from the island of Syria and we have
a lot of merchandise to sell," we answered.

328
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
"'Then wait here until midday," he said.

329
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
'At midday they opened the gates and we went
to the marketplace.

330
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
'After a month in the city of Illel, I became
tired of it.

331
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
I walked in the streets of the city and came
to the garden of the god of the city.

332
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
The priests in their yellow tunics walked
silently in the garden.

333
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
There was a red house.

334
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
This was the home of the god.

335
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
The doors had images of golden animals and
peacocks on them.

336
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
'There was a pool of clear water in front
of the temple.

337
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
I sat down near it.

338
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
One of the priests came to me and stood behind
me.

339
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
"'What do you want?" he asked me.

340
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
"'I want to see the god," I replied.

341
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
"'The god is hunting in a forest," said the
priest, and he looked at me strangely.

342
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
"'Which forest is he in?

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Tell me, and I will go there," I answered.

344
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
'He moved his hands on his soft tunic.

345
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
"The god is asleep," he murmured.

346
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
"'Which bed is he in?

347
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Tell me, and I will stand near him," I answered.

348
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
"'The god is at the feast," he cried.

349
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
"'I will drink bitter or sweet wine with him,"
I said.

350
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
'He was surprised and accompanied me into
the temple.

351
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
'In the first room I saw an ebony idol on
a throne and it the size of a man.

352
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
There was a ruby on its forehead.

353
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Its feet were red from the blood of a baby
goat.

354
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
'I said to the priest, "Is this the god?"

355
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
'"This is the god," he answered.

356
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
'"This is not the god.

357
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Show me the god," I cried, "or I will kill
you."

358
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
I touched his hand, and it became small and
dry.

359
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
"'Make my hand better, and I will show you
the god," he cried.

360
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
'So I breathed on his hand, and it became
better.

361
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
He trembled and accompanied me into the second
room.

362
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
I saw an ivory idol on a lotus of jade with
great emeralds on it.

363
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
This idol was twice as big as a man.

364
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
"'Is this the god?"

365
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
I asked him.

366
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
"'This is the god," he replied.

367
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
'"This is not the god.

368
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Show me the god," I cried, "or I will kill
you!"

369
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I touched his eyes, and they became blind.

370
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
'"Please make my eyes better.

371
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Then I will show you the god," he cried.

372
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
'So I breathed on his eyes and they could
see again.

373
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
The priest trembled and accompanied me into
the third room.

374
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
There was not an idol in it, only a mirror.

375
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
'I said to the priest, "Where is the god?"

376
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
'He answered me, "There is no god, but this
is the Mirror of Wisdom.

377
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
It reflects all the things in heaven and on
earth.

378
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
But it does not reflect the face of the person
if they look into it.

379
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
So, this person can become wise.

380
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
There are many other mirrors, but they are
mirrors of Opinion.

381
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
This is the only Mirror of Wisdom.

382
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
When you possess this mirror, you know everything.

383
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
So, it is a god, and we pray to this god."

384
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
I looked into the mirror.

385
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
The priest didn't lie.

386
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
'Then I did something strange, but it is not
important.

387
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I placed the mirror in a valley near here.

388
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
We can walk there in three days.

389
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Let me enter you again and be your servant,
and you will have wisdom.'

390
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
But the young fisherman laughed.

391
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
'Love is better than wisdom,' he cried, 'and
the little mermaid loves me.'

392
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
'No, there is nothing better than wisdom,'
said the soul.

393
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
'Love is better,' answered the young fisherman.

394
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
He went back to the sea, and the soul walked
away and cried.

395
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
CHAPTER FIVE
The Riny of Rihes

396
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
After the second year, the soul came down
to the sea and called the young fisherman.

397
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
He came out of the sea and said, 'Why do you
call me?'

398
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
The soul answered, 'Come nearer.

399
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
I want to speak to you because I saw marvellous
things.'

400
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
So he came nearer, and sat in the water and
listened.

401
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
The soul said to him, 'When I left you, I
went towards the South and travelled.

402
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Everything precious comes from the South.

403
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
'I travelled six days to the city of Ashter.

404
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I saw the city on the morning of the seventh
day.

405
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
'The city is like a bazaar.

406
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
It is wonderful.

407
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Merchants sit on silk carpets.

408
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Some of them sell strange perfumes from the
islands of the Indian Sea, and the oil of

409
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
red roses.

410
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Other merchants sell fantastic jewellery with
tiger claws in gold and leopard claws in gold

411
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
also.

412
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
'The people sell all kinds of fruit: purple
figs, yellow melons, white grapes, red-gold

413
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
oranges and oval lemons of green gold.

414
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
I saw an elephant.

415
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
It stopped and began eating the oranges and
the people laughed.

416
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
You cannot imagine how strange these people
are.

417
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
When they are happy they buy a bird in a cage.

418
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Then they release the bird because they want
to be happier.

419
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
When they are sad they hit their bodies with
thorns because they want to be sadder.

420
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
'On the feast of the New Moon, the Emperor
came out of his palace and went into the mosque

421
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
to pray.

422
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
The people covered their faces, but I showed
him no form of respect.

423
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
'That night the guards of the Emperor came
for me.

424
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
They accompanied me into the palace.

425
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
We walked across a great court and then we
entered a beautiful garden.

426
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
At the end of the garden there was a pavilion.

427
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Then the captain of the guard told me to enter.

428
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
'The young Emperor was there on a bed of lion
skins, and he held a falcon.

429
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
A Nubian stood behind him.

430
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
A large scimitar of steel was on a table next
to the bed.

431
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
'When the Emperor saw me he was worried, and
said to me, "What is your name?

432
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Don't you know that I am Emperor of this city?"

433
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
I did not answer him.

434
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
'He indicated the scimitar, and the Nubian
took it and hit me with great violence.

435
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
It did not hurt me.

436
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
The Nubian was terrified and went away.

437
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
'The Emperor tried to kill me with a lance
but he didn't hurt me.

438
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
He tried to kill me with an arrow, but I stopped
it in the air.

439
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Then the Emperor said to me, "Why can't I
hurt you?

440
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Are you a prophet or the son of a prophet?

441
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Please leave my city tonight.

442
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
You are here now and I am not its lord."

443
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
'I answered him, "Give me half of your treasure.

444
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Then I will go away

445
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
'So, he took my hand and accompanied me to
a large room.

446
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
He touched one of the walls and it opened.

447
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Then we walked down a corridor.

448
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
He said a magic word and a granite door opened.

449
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
The Emperor covered his eyes with his hands
to protect them from the light of the jewels

450
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
there.

451
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
It was really marvellous inside.

452
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
There were huge tortoise-shells full of pearls,
and many other wonderful jewels.

453
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
'Then the Emperor said to me, "This is my
house of treasure, and half of it is yours.

454
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
But you must go tonight.

455
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
My father the Sun must not see this: I cannot
kill a man in the city."

456
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
'I answered him, "The gold and all the precious
jewels are yours.

457
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
I only want your little ring."

458
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
'The Emperor frowned.

459
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
"It is only a ring of lead," he cried, "and
it has no value.

460
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Take your half of the treasure and go away
from my city."

461
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
'"No," I answered, "I know that it is really
the Ring of Riches."

462
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
'The Emperor trembled and said, "Take all
the treasure and go from my city.

463
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
You can also have my half of the treasure."

464
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
'Then I did something strange, but it is not
important.

465
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
What is important is that I put the Ring of
Riches in a cave.

466
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
You can arrive there in one day.

467
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
The owner of this Ring is richer than all
the kings of the world.'

468
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
But the young fisherman laughed.

469
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
'Love is better than riches,' he cried, 'and
the little mermaid loves me.'

470
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
'No, nothing is better than riches,' said
the soul.

471
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
'Love is better,' answered the young fisherman.

472
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
He went back to the sea, and the soul walked
away and cried.

473
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
CHAPTER SIX
The Souls of Third Journey

474
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
After the third year, the soul came down to
the sea and called the young fisherman.

475
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
He came out of the sea and said, 'Why do you
call me?'

476
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
The soul answered, 'Come nearer.

477
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I want to speak to you because I saw marvellous
things.'

478
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
So he came nearer, and sat in the water and
listened.

479
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
The soul said to him, 'I went to an inn near
a river in a city.

480
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I sat with sailors and they ordered food and
drink.

481
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
After some time an old man entered with a
carpet and a lute.

482
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
He put the carpet on the floor.

483
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
When he played the lute, a girl came in and
began to dance.

484
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
There was a veil on her face, and she had
no shoes.

485
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Her feet moved on the carpet like little white
pigeons.

486
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
It was really marvellous and it is only one
day away from here.'

487
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
The young fisherman heard these words.

488
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
He remembered that the little mermaid had
no feet and could not dance.

489
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
He thought, 'It is only one day away, and
I can return to my love.'

490
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
He laughed, stood up in the water and walked
towards the beach.

491
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
When he reached the beach, his soul ran towards
him and entered him.

492
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Then the young fisherman saw on the sand the
shadow of the body, the body of the soul.

493
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
They began their journey, and the next evening
they came to a city.

494
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
The young fisherman said to his soul, 'Does
she dance in this city?'

495
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
His soul answered him, 'Not in this city,
but another.

496
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Let's enter this city anyway.'

497
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
So they entered and walked in the streets.

498
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
The young fisherman saw a silver cup on a
stall in the Street of the Jewellers.

499
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
His soul said to him, 'Take that silver cup
and hide it.'

500
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
So he took the silver cup and hid it, and
they went quickly out of the city.

501
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
When they were far from the city, the young
fisherman threw the cup away.

502
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
He said to his soul,

503
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
'It was not a good thing to take the cup and
hide it!'

504
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
But his soul answered him, 'Calm down, calm
down.'

505
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
On the evening of the second day they came
to a city.

506
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
The young fisherman said to his soul, 'Does
she dance in this city?'

507
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
His soul answered him, 'Not in this city,
but in another.

508
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Let's enter this city anyway.'

509
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
So they entered and walked in the streets.

510
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
In the Street of the Sellers of Sandals, the
young fisherman saw a child.

511
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
His soul said to him, 'Hit that child!'

512
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
So he hit the child, and the child cried,
and then they went quickly out of the city.

513
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
When they were far from the city, the young
fisherman became angry and said to his soul,

514
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
'It was not a good thing to hit the child!'

515
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
But his soul answered him, 'Calm down, calm
down.'

516
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
On the evening of the third day they came
to a city.

517
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
The young fisherman said to his soul, 'Does
she dance in this city?'

518
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
His soul answered him, 'Perhaps this is the
city.

519
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Let's enter.'

520
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
They walked in the streets, but the young
fisherman could not find the inn near the

521
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
river.

522
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
He wanted to leave, but his soul said to him,
'Let's stay here tonight.

523
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Perhaps there are robbers outside.'

524
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
So the fisherman sat down in the marketplace.

525
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
After some time a merchant came and said to
him, 'Why are you here?

526
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
The market is closed.'

527
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
The young fisherman answered him, 'I can't
find an inn in this city.

528
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I have no family here and I need a room for
the night.'

529
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
'We are all of the same family,' said the
merchant, 'and one God made us.

530
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Come with me.

531
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
I have a room.'

532
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
The young fisherman followed the merchant
to his house.

533
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
The merchant gave him good food and a comfortable
room.

534
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
The young fisherman then went to sleep.

535
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
After three hours his soul woke him and said,
'Go to the room of the merchant and kill him,

536
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
and take his gold.'

537
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
The young fisherman went into the merchant's
room.

538
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
There was a sword near his feet, and nine
purses of gold next to the bed.

539
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
When he touched the sword, the merchant woke
up and said, 'Why do you want to kill me?

540
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
I gave you good food and a room.

541
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I was kind to you!'

542
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
His soul said to the young fisherman, 'Hit
him!'

543
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
So he hit him and the merchant lost consciousness.

544
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
He then took the nine purses of gold, and
went quickly away from the city.

545
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
When they were far from the city, the young
fisherman said to his soul, 'It was bad to

546
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
hit the merchant and take his gold!'

547
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
But his soul answered him, 'Calm down, calm
down.'

548
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
'No,' cried the young fisherman, 'I cannot
be calm.

549
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
You told me to do bad things and I hate these
things.

550
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I also hate you.

551
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Why did you do these things?'

552
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
His soul answered him, 'When you sent me out
into the world, you did not give me a heart.

553
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
So I learned to do all these things and love
them.'

554
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
'What are you saying?'

555
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
murmured the young fisherman.

556
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
'You know,' answered his soul.

557
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
'You did not give me a heart.

558
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
So stay calm.

559
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
You will give other people all kinds of pain,
and you will receive all kinds of pleasure.'

560
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
The young fisherman said to his soul, 'No,
you are bad, and I forgot about my love and

561
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
did many bad things because of you.'

562
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
His soul answered him, 'You did not forget
that you sent me away without a heart.

563
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Let's go to another city and enjoy life together.

564
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
We have nine purses of gold.'

565
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
But the young fisherman took the nine purses
of gold, and threw them on the ground.

566
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
'No, I will not come with you, and I will
send you away again,' said the young fisherman.

567
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
He turned his back to the moon.

568
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
With the little knife he tried to cut his
shadow from his feet to eliminate his soul.

569
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
But his soul did not leave him, and said to
him, 'The magic of the witch will not work.

570
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
It only works once in a man's life.

571
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
I will stay with you forever, and this is
your punishment and your recompense.'

572
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Now the young fisherman was desperate and
cried because his soul was very bad.

573
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
When it was day the young fisherman said to
his soul, 'I will tie my hands together.

574
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Then I cannot do what you tell me to do.

575
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
1 will return to the bay because my love sings
there.

576
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I will call her.

577
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I will tell her about the bad things I did
and the bad things you did to me.'

578
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
When he arrived on the beach, he freed his
hands and called the mermaid.

579
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
But she did not come.

580
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
His soul laughed at him and said, 'Your love
gives you little joy.

581
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Come with me to the Valley of Pleasure.

582
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
That is better for you.'

583
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
The young fisherman did not answer his soul.

584
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
He built a house by the bay and lived there
for a year.

585
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
Every morning he called the mermaid, and every
midday he called her again, and at night he

586
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
spoke her name.

587
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
But she never came to see him, and he did
not see her anywhere.

588
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
His soul always asked him to do bad things.

589
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
But the young fisherman never listened to
him because the power of his love was so great.

590
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
CHAPTER SEVEN

591
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Love

592
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
After another year, the soul thought, 'I tempted
him with bad, and his love is stronger than

593
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I am.

594
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
I will now tempt him with good, and perhaps
he will come with me.'

595
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
So he spoke to the young fisherman and said,
'I told you about the joy of the world, and

596
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
you did not listen to me.

597
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Now I will tell you about the pain in the
world, and maybe you will listen.

598
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Pain is the Lord of this world, and nobody
can escape it.

599
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Some people do not have clothes and other
people do not have food, and others are ill.

600
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Come, let's go and help these people.

601
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Why do you wait here for your love?

602
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
What is love?

603
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Why do you think it is so important?'

604
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
But the young fisherman did not answer.

605
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
The power of his love was so great.

606
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Every morning he called the mermaid, and every
midday he called her again, and at night he

607
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
spoke her name.

608
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
But she never came to see him, and he did
not see her anywhere.

609
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
After the second year, the soul said to the
fisherman, 'I tempted you with bad, and I

610
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
tempted you with good, and your love is stronger
than I am.

611
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
So, I will not tempt you anymore, but can
I please enter your heart and be there with

612
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
you again?'

613
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
'Of course you can enter,' said the young
fisherman.

614
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
'I am sure you suffered when you did not have
a heart.'

615
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
'But I can find no place to enter because
there is love all around your heart.

616
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
There's no space for me,' cried the soul.

617
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
'I am very sorry,' said the young fisherman.

618
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Just then he heard a terrible cry of sadness
from the sea.

619
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
The young fisherman ran to the beach.

620
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
The black waves came quickly to the beach.

621
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
They carried something that was whiter than
silver.

622
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
There at his feet the young fisherman saw
the dead body of the little mermaid.

623
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
He sat down next to her, and he kissed her
cold red mouth.

624
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
He told the dead mermaid about his soul and
all the bad things.

625
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
He put her little hands around his neck, and
he touched her neck with his fingers.

626
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
His joy was bitter, and his pain was full
of strange happiness.

627
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
The black sea came nearer and nearer to them.

628
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
'Run away,' said his soul.

629
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
'The sea is coming closer and closer.

630
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Go away!

631
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
It will kill you.

632
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Run away to a safe place.

633
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
But please do not send me into another world
without a heart.'

634
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
But the young fisherman did not listen to
his soul.

635
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
He said to the little mermaid, 'Love is better
than wisdom, and more precious than riches,

636
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
and more beautiful than the feet of the daughters
of men.

637
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I called you in the morning, but you did not
come.

638
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
The moon heard your name, but you did not
listen to me.

639
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
I was bad when I abandoned you.

640
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
But your love was always with me, and it was
always stronger than bad and good.

641
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
And now that you are dead, I will die with
you also.'

642
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
His soul implored him to leave.

643
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
But his love was too great and he did not
listen to his soul.

644
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
The sea came near and tried to cover him with
its waves.

645
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
When he knew that the end was near, the young
fisherman kissed the cold lips of the mermaid,

646
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
and his heart broke.

647
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
It broke because it was so full of love.

648
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Then the soul finally entered his heart, and
the sea covered the young fisherman with its

649
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
waves the Fullers.

650
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Field of the Fullers

651
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
In the morning the priest said, 'I will go
and bless the sea because it was not calm

652
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
last night.'

653
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Monks, musicians and many other people went
with him.

654
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
When the priest reached the beach he saw the
young fisherman.

655
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
He was dead in the water and the body of the
little mermaid was in his arms.

656
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
The priest frowned and said, 'I will not bless
the sea or anything in the sea.

657
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
The young fisherman abandoned God for love,
and the punishment of God killed him and his

658
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
love.

659
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Now take his body and the body of the mermaid
and bury them in the corner of the Field of

660
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
the Fullers.

661
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Do not put any sign there.'

662
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
The people put the dead bodies in a deep hole
in the corner of the Field of the Fullers.

663
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
They covered the hole with earth.

664
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
No sweet herbs grew there.

665
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Three years later on a holy day, the priest
went to the chapel to speak to the people

666
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
about the anger of God.

667
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
When he went to the altar, he saw that there
were strange flowers on the altar.

668
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Their strange beauty worried him and their
perfume was sweet.

669
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
He was particularly happy and he did not understand
why he was so happy.

670
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
He wanted to speak to them about the anger
of God.

671
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
But the beauty of the white flowers worried
him, and their perfume was sweet.

672
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
He did not speak of the anger of God.

673
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
He spoke of the love of God.

674
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
And he did not know why he spoke like this.

675
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
When he finished speaking, the people cried,
and his eyes were full of tears.

676
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
He was in a dream, and he said to his deacons,
'What are the flowers on the altar?

677
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Where do they come from?'

678
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
They answered him, 'We do not know what kind
of flowers they are, but they come from the

679
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
corner of the Field of the Fullers.'

680
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
The priest trembled, and returned to his house
and prayed.

681
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Early the next morning he left his house with
monks, musicians and many other people.

682
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
He walked to the beach and blessed the sea,
and all the wild things in it.

683
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
He also blessed the fauns, and the little
things that dance in the forest.

684
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
He blessed all things in the world of God,
and the people were full of joy.

685
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
But the people of the sea went to another
part of the sea, and they never came back

686
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
again.

687
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:08,882
- THE END -
