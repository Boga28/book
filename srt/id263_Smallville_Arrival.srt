CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,400
A child arrives

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,360
1989, Smallville, Kansas, USA.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,520
Suddenly the sky was dark.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,760
There were hundreds of meteors in the sky.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,480
They went faster and faster.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,360
There was a very small spaceship in the centre of the meteors.


8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,840
There was one person in this spaceship.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,680
A child.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,240
Nothing happened in Smallville.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,120
It was a small town in Kansas and it was a very boring place.


12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,640
Then, one day, everything changed.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,280
Lionel Luthor arrived from Metropolis in his helicopter.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,600
He was a rich man, but he was not a nice man.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,120
He loved money, not people.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,600
His young son Lex sat next to him.

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,160
Lex was nine years old.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,480
He had red hair and blue eyes.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,360
His face was white and his eyes were closed.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,120
He was very frightened.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,960
'Lex!' shouted his father.

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,520
'Open your eyes now!'

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
'I can't,' Lex said.'

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,160
I hate this helicopter.'

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,640
'Luthors aren't frightened of anything,' Lionel said.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,120
'Look out of the window - now!'

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Lex slowly opened his eyes and looked down.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
I'm going to die, he thought.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,960
Two men waited for the helicopter in the car park of an old factory.


30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,160
The men were brothers: Dale and Bill Ross.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,160
'Why does Lionel Luthor want to buy our factory?' asked Dale.


32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,280
'I don't know,' said Bill, 'but we need his money.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,640
He isn't going to change anything.

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,720
He told us that, and I believe him.'

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Jonathan Kent and his wife Martha went into a shop on Main Street.


36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,360
Their faces were brown from the sun and their jeans were old.


37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
They lived on a farm.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,360
'Afternoon, Nell,' Jonathan said.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,960
'Hello, Jonathan,' Nell said.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,600
She smiled at him.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,920
She liked Jonathan.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
'Hello, Martha,' she said.

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,120
She didn't smile at Martha.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,400
She didn't like her.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,520
'I'd like some tulips,' said Martha.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,120
'Red tulips, please.'

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,640
There was a little girl in the shop.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,160
She was very pretty with dark hair.

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,200
She was three years old.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
'Hello, Lana,' said Martha.

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,840
'Where are your mom and dad today?'

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,480
'They're at the homecoming game,' Nell said.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,520
'Here are your tulips.'

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,640
She gave them to Jonathan.

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,960
In the street, Martha said sadly, 'Oh Jonathan, I looked at Lana's
little face and I...'

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
She stopped.

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,040
'I know, Martha,' said Jonathan.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,400
'We both want a child.'

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,560
The meteors came closer and closer.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,920
At the factory, Lex was bored.

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,720
He walked away into a cornfield next to the factory.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Lionel Luthor read the papers.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,440
'Where do I put my name?' he asked the Ross brothers.

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,120
He smiled.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,040
The factory was his now.

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,560
Alone in the field, Lex suddenly heard something.

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,480
'Help me!'

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,240
What was it?

69
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Then he heard it again.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,400
'Help me!'

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,080
He walked through the corn and suddenly there was a scarecrow.


72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,200
Lex was frightened.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,960
That scarecrow can talk! he thought.

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,680
But then it wasn't a scarecrow.

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
It was a teenage boy.

76
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,320
The boy was on a big wooden pole.

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,240
He had no shirt.

78
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,640
There was a big red S on the front of his body.

79
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,800
'Help me, please,' he said one more time.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
THOOOMMM!!!

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,880
The first big meteor crashed into the cornfield.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,200
Lex ran.

83
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,120
A car stopped opposite Nell's shop on Main Street.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,200
Nell took little Lana in her arms and walked out of the shop.


85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,840
Lewis and Laura Lang were in the car.

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Lana saw them.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,200
'Mommy! Daddy!' she shouted.

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,080
Nell looked up and saw a big meteor in the sky.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,280
THOOOMMM!!!

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,400
The meteor crashed into the Langs' car.

91
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,920
Lana's parents were dead.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,520
Lionel Luthor ran across the cornfield. 'Lex!

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,880
Where are you?' he shouted.

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
He saw some red hair on the ground.

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Then he found his son.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,760
Lex was on the ground.

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
He was very frightened.

98
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,800
But where was his beautiful red hair?

99
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,720
He was nine years old and he now had no hair at all.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,160
Jonathan and Martha Kent were on their way home.

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Suddenly a meteor hit the road behind them.

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,800
'What was that, Jonathan?' asked Martha.

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,320
'What's happening?'

104
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,360
THOOOMMM!!!

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
A spaceship crashed into the road in front of them.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,960
Jonathan tried to stop the car but it crashed into a cornfield.


107
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,320
When they opened their eyes, they saw a boy.

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,800
He was about three years old and he had no clothes.

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
The boy pulled Jonathan's car door.

110
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
It opened.

111
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
Then he pulled Martha's car door.

112
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,200
It opened too.

113
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,040
Martha and Jonathan were very surprised.

114
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,640
They were soon out of the car.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,440
Martha took the boy in her arms.

116
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,880
'Are you okay?' asked Jonathan.

117
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,320
'Yes, I'm fine.

118
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,560
You?' said Martha.

119
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
'Yes.

120
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,480
Children don't fall from the sky,' Jonathan said.

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,040
'Then where did he come from?' Martha asked.

122
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,720
'I don't think his mom and dad are from Kansas!'

123
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,440
'We can't keep him, Martha,' said Jonathan.

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,640
'What can we say to people?

125
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,280
"We found him in a cornfield!"?'

126
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,360
'We didn't find him, Jonathan,' said Martha.

127
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
'He found us.'

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,760
CHAPTER TWO

129
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:49,120
Special and different

130
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
Jonathan and Martha took the boy home to their farm.

131
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,120
They named him Clark.

132
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,520
They didn't tell him about his arrival.

133
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,040
They didn't tell other people either.

134
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,440
If someone asked, they said, 'He's Martha's sister's son.

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,680
She died.'

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,240
They didn't want Clark to be different from other children.

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,080
But he was different.

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,560
He was special.

139
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
He was very strong.

140
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,680
He was very fast.

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,640
Nothing hurt him.

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,360
When he was eight, a big milk can hit his head.

143
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
It didn't hurt him.

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,720
2001, Smallville, Kansas, USA.

145
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,840
Clark sat at his computer.

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,880
Every morning he used the Internet.

147
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,720
He wanted to find stories about special people - very strong
people, very fast people.

148
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,000
'Clark Kent!'

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,160
Martha called.

150
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
'You're going to be late for the bus!'

151
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,680
'OK, I'm coming,' shouted Clark.

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,200
He put on his school clothes and shoes, cleaned his room and
put his schoolbooks in his bag.

153
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,080
All in one minute!

154
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,040
Martha came into his room with some clothes.

155
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,840
'You can wear these to the homecoming dance this weekend,' she
said.

156
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,320
'I'm not going, Mom,' said Clark.

157
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,840
'I haven't got a girl to go with.'

158
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,280
'Did you ask anyone?' Martha asked.

159
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,520
'No,' he said.

160
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,480
He ran down to the kitchen.

161
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,640
'What's that letter, son?' asked Jonathan.

162
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,160
'It's for the football team,' said Clark.

163
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,320
'They want some new players.'

164
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,880
'You can't do it,' said Jonathan.

165
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
'Oh, please, Dad,' said Clark.

166
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,200
'I can run slowly.

167
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,760
I can be careful.'

168
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,280
'I'm sorry, Clark,' said Jonathan, 'but the answer is no.'

169
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,360
'I don't want to be different,' shouted Clark.

170
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,880
'I can never do normal things.

171
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,400
People at school think I'm a loser.'

172
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,320
He ran out of the door.

173
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,720
'We must tell him about the spaceship,' Martha said to Jonathan.


174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,320
Clark walked to the bus stop.

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,880
He was late again.

176
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,520
The school bus drove off without him.

177
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,240
'Oh, no!' he said.

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
'Everything's going wrong today.'

179
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Suddenly he smiled a big smile.

180
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,720
He turned and ran through the fields at 100 kilometres an hour.


181
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,160
The bus arrived at school.

182
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,400
Clark's friends, Pete Ross and Chloe Sullivan, were on it.

183
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Chloe was new in Smallville.

184
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
Her dad worked at LuthorCorp.

185
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,320
She wrote for the school newspaper and took photos for it.

186
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,040
She was always ready with her camera.

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,480
'Are you going to the dance with anyone?' Pete asked Chloe.

188
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,920
'No, not yet,' said Chloe.

189
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,520
'Well, if Clark doesn't ask you...'

190
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,560
'I'm not interested in Clark, Pete,' she said.

191
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,440
'Right,' said Pete.

192
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
He knew that wasn't true.

193
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,640
'Well, we can go to the dance together if you want,' he said.


194
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,080
'Not boy and girl.

195
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,240
Friend and friend.'

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
Suddenly Clark was there.

197
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,720
'Hi, you two,' he said.

198
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,960
Pete and Chloe were very surprised to see their friend.

199
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,320
'We saw you at your farm,' Chloe said.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,240
'You weren't on the bus!'

201
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,920
'I came a different way,' said Clark.

202
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,240
'Are you ready for the football team, Clark?' asked Pete.

203
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,800
'I'm not going to do it,' said Clark.

204
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,800
'But, Clark,' said Pete, 'do you want to be the scarecrow?'

205
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,480
'The scarecrow!' Chloe said loudly.

206
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,360
'What's the scarecrow?'

207
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
'Shh!' said Pete.

208
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,520
'This happens here every year, Chloe.

209
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,960
Before the homecoming game, the football players choose someone.


210
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,560
A loser.

211
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,000
They take him to the cornfield and take all his clothes.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Then they write a big red S on the front of his body.'

213
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,760
'And they put him on a big wooden pole,' said Clark.

214
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,120
'So he's a scarecrow.'

215
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
'How terrible!' said Chloe.

216
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Then Clark saw a beautiful girl with long, brown hair and a lovely
smile.

217
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,400
'See you later,' he said to his friends.

218
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,440
Clark walked across to Lana Lang.

219
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,480
He was a metre from her.

220
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
Suddenly he crashed to the ground.

221
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
His books went everywhere.

222
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,400
Why does this always happen near Lana? he thought.

223
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Is it because I like her?

224
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,040
'Hi, Clark, are you okay?' she asked.

225
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,280
'Hi, Lana,' he said.

226
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,160
'Yeah, I'm fine.'

227
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
She gave his books to him.

228
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,960
'You're reading Nietzsche, huh?

229
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,320
Are you man or superman?'

230
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,640
'I don't know,' Clark said.

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,120
They smiled.

232
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,400
'Lana!' shouted Whitney Fordman, a tall, good-looking student.


233
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,440
He was Lana's boyfriend.

234
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,640
Whitney was fantastic at sports.

235
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,880
He was in all the school teams.

236
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,440
He ran up and kissed Lana.

237
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:45,720
They walked away together.

238
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,200
CHAPTER THREE

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
Two terrible shocks

240
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,280
A student looked at the photos of the school sports teams.

241
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,520
He looked at the 1989 photo.

242
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,920
'You're late for your class, young man,' said a teacher behind
him.

243
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
The student turned.

244
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,800
'What's your name?' asked the teacher.

245
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
'Are you new?'

246
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,520
Suddenly the student hit the teacher in the face.

247
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,360
A big blue electric shock went from the student's hand into the
teacher's body.

248
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,080
The teacher crashed into the wall.

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,040
The student took the photo of the three happy football players
and left the school.

250
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm gonna get you! he thought.

251
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,760
Lex Luthor drove his Porsche through the country to the LuthorCorp
factory in Smallville.

252
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,320
'The Smallville factory doesn't make any money,' Lionel Luthor
said to his son.

253
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,080
'Go to Smallville.

254
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,520
Make changes!'

255
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,240
So Lex left Metropolis.

256
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,800
And here he was.

257
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,640
In the centre of nowhere.

258
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,800
Great!

259
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,280
Lex arrived at LuthorCorp.

260
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,680
He was twenty-one years old and he still had no hair.

261
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,640
He walked into the factory.

262
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,960
A man sat at a desk with his lunch.

263
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,280
'Mr Luthor!' the man said, surprised.

264
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,320
'My name's Gabe Sullivan.'

265
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
'Call me Lex.''

266
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,360
The workers aren't happy, Lex,' said Gabe.

267
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,920
'They're frightened about their jobs.'

268
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,600
'It's OK,' said Lex.

269
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,720
'I want everyone to stay.'

270
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,760
'But your father said...'

271
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,560
'I'm not my father,' said Lex Luthor.

272
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,920
Later, Lex drove down a small country road at 100 kilometres
an hour.

273
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,600
His car radio played loud music.

274
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,840
Not far away, Clark was on a bridge.

275
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,880
He looked into the water.

276
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,600
He thought about his life and he wasn't happy.

277
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,640
He didn't hear Lex Luthor's car.

278
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,400
Lex answered his mobile phone.

279
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,760
He didn't look at the road for a minute.

280
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
He drove onto the bridge.

281
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,080
Then he saw Clark.

282
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,680
He tried to stop the car but Clark was right in front of him.


283
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,680
I'm going to hit him! Lex thought.

284
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Their eyes met.

285
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,920
Then Lex's car crashed into Clark.

286
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,360
THOOOMMMH!

287
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,200
The car and Clark went over the bridge and into the water.

288
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Clark's eyes closed and everything went black.

289
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:52,320
CHAPTER FOUR

290
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,440
The green necklace

291
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Under the water, Clark opened his eyes.

292
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,960
He was OK.

293
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,640
He wasn't hurt.

294
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Then he remembered the car.

295
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
THE CAR!

296
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,840
He found the car with Lex in it.

297
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,200
Lex's eyes were closed.

298
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,880
Clark pulled open the door and pulled Lex out.

299
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,240
He took him in his arms and started to swim.

300
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,200
When Clark put Lex on the ground, he thought he was dead.

301
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,800
Clark put his left hand on Lex's body.

302
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,920
Then he put his right hand over his left.

303
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,320
'One, two. One, two. One, two.

304
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
Come on!

305
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Don't die!

306
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,280
' he said.

307
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,760
Some water came out of Lex's mouth.

308
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,880
He opened his eyes and saw Clark.

309
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,120
He was very surprised.

310
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,840
'But I hit you!' he said.

311
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
'Well, I'm not dead,' said Clark.

312
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,760
Clark looked at the bridge.

313
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,360
A car hit me at 100 kilometres an hour.

314
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm not hurt.

315
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,400
I am not normal, he thought.

316
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,880
The police and a doctor arrived.

317
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
Then Jonathan Kent arrived too.

318
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,320
Jonathan put his arms around Clark.

319
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,400
'Are you OK, son?' he asked.

320
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,280
'I'm fine, Dad,' said Clark.

321
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,840
'I'm Jonathan Kent.

322
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,480
This is my son,' Jonathan told a policeman.

323
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,480
'Who was the stupid driver of the car?'

324
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,680
'I was,' said Lex Luthor.

325
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,000
'You have a very special son, Mr Kent,' he said.

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,360
'You saved my life, Clark.

327
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
How can I thank you?'

328
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,680
'Drive more slowly,' said Jonathan.

329
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,080
After dinner that night, Clark went up to his special room in
the barn.

330
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
He looked at the night sky.

331
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,640
Then he looked over at the farmhouse next to the Kents' farm.


332
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,280
The front door opened and Lana Lang came out.

333
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
Clark smiled.

334
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,680
But then Whitney came out.

335
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,440
Whitney put his arms around Lana.

336
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,800
'Are you alone tonight?' he asked.

337
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,120
'Yes, Aunt Nell's at Lex Luthor's,' said Lana.

338
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
'Did you hear about Clark?' she said.

339
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,560
'He saved Lex's life today.'

340
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,400
'Clark?' Whitney said.

341
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
'Clark Kent?'

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,400
'Yes,' said Lana.

343
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,320
'Sometimes people can surprise you.'

344
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,480
Whitney didn't want to talk about Clark.

345
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
He wanted to talk about Whitney.

346
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,240
'I've got a game on Saturday,' he said.

347
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,960
'Some important people are going to be there.'

348
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,600
'That's great!' Lana said.

349
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,840
Whitney wanted to be a top football player.

350
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,240
It was his dream.

351
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,280
She gave her green necklace to him.

352
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,120
The necklace was part of a meteor.

353
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,800
A special meteor.

354
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,560
This meteor hit Lana's parents' car.

355
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,800
'I can't take this, Lana,' Whitney said.

356
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,880
'It means everything to you.'

357
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,280
'Keep it just for the game,' she said.

358
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,080
He put it in his jacket.

359
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:30,720
Then he kissed her.

360
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,800
CHAPTER FIVE

361
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
The true story

362
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,680
Tony Carozza had a job at a car place.

363
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,080
It was evening.

364
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,400
It was almost time to go home.

365
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,960
A boy came into the shop.

366
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
'I'm sorry,' said Tony.

367
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,640
'Were closed.'

368
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,760
The boy said nothing.

369
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,120
Tony looked at him carefully.

370
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,920
'I know you,' he said.

371
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,760
'You were that scarecrow years ago!

372
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,480
What happened to you?

373
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,640
Why aren't you older?'

374
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,640
The boy still said nothing.

375
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
'Answer me, Stupid!' said Tony.

376
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,120
'I'm talking to you!'

377
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,840
The boy suddenly hit Tony in the face.

378
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,400
A big blue electric shock went from his hand into Tony Carozza's
body.

379
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,080
Tony crashed onto the floor.

380
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,720
He didn't move.

381
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,120
On the wall, there was a photo of three happy football players.


382
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,600
The boy smiled and left the shop.

383
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,040
It was the day after the car crash.

384
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,440
When Clark walked into school, every student said, 'Nice work,
Clark!'

385
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,640
'Am I at the right school?' Clark asked Pete and Chloe.

386
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,520
'You saved Lex Luthor's life,' said Chloe.

387
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
'This is going in the school newspaper.'

388
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,600
'My dad hates the Luthors,' said Pete.

389
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,400
'Yes, but Lionel Luthor bought your dad's factory.

390
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,760
Not Lex,' said Clark.

391
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,800
When Clark arrived home on the farm that afternoon, he found
a new red car in front of the house.

392
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,120
There was a letter on the car.

393
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Clark opened it.

394
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,040
Thank you, Clark, he read.

395
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,240
I hope you like red.

396
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,840
Clark looked at the car.

397
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,800
He was very excited.

398
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,600
'You can't keep it, Clark,' Jonathan said.

399
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,160
'Why not?'

400
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,320
'Because the Luthors aren't good people.

401
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
They're rich thanks to Smallville.

402
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
They bought our friends' houses and their farms.'

403
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,760
'Lex's father did all that,' said Clark.

404
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,160
'Not Lex.'

405
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,640
'I'm sorry, Clark,' Jonathan said.

406
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,200
'I know you're angry.'

407
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,040
'Angry!' shouted Clark.

408
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,880
'You have no idea!'

409
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,720
He ran up to his room in the barn.

410
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,240
'You must tell him now,' Martha said.

411
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,480
Jonathan went to Clark's room.

412
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,160
He put his arms around his son.

413
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,000
'I'm going to tell you the story of the day of the meteors,'
he said.

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
He gave Clark a picture.

415
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,160
There were lots of letters and numbers on it.

416
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,920
Was it a language?

417
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,760
'I think this is from your mom and dad,' he said.

418
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,680
'What does it say?' Clark asked.

419
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,160
'I have no idea,' said Jonathan.

420
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,720
'They came from a different world.'

421
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,920
'A different world?!' laughed Clark.

422
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,160
'So I arrived in a spaceship?

423
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,800
That's stupid!'

424
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,080
'Do you want to see that spaceship?' asked Jonathan.

425
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,800
'It's under the barn.'

426
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,240
When he saw the little spaceship, Clark was very angry.

427
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,120
'Why didn't you tell me this before?' he shouted.

428
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
He ran out of the barn.

429
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,520
CHAPTER SIX

430
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:21,560
A quick kiss

431
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:34,960
Lana Lang looked at the words: Lewis Lang 1957-1989 Laura Lang
1959-1989.

432
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
She heard something behind her.

433
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,920
'Who's there?' she called.

434
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,560
'It's me.

435
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,520
It's Clark,' he said.

436
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
'What are you doing here?'

437
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,480
Lana looked at Clark.

438
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
He was nice.

439
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,800
'Please don't tell anyone,' she said.

440
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,680
'I come here to talk to my mom and dad.

441
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,200
Is that stupid?'

442
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,080
'No, it isn't stupid,' Clark said.

443
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,720
'Do you remember them?'

444
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,760
'Not very well,' said Lana.

445
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
'They died when I was three.

446
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,920
Do you want to meet them?'

447
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,720
She sat on the ground.

448
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,920
'Mom, Dad, this is Clark Kent,' she said.

449
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,520
'Hi, Mr and Mrs Lang,' said Clark.

450
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,800
'I'm sorry?

451
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,880
What's that?'

452
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,400
He sat down and listened.

453
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:36,880
'Your mom says, "You're never alone, Lana,"' he said, 'and your
dad says, "You're beautiful."'

454
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,280
Lana smiled.

455
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,200
'Thank you, Clark,' she said.

456
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,800
'Can I walk home with you?' asked Clark.

457
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,200
'Yes.

458
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,760
Thanks,' said Lana.

459
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,800
When they arrived at Lana's house, she said, 'We talked for a
long time tonight, Clark.

460
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,360
It was nice.'

461
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
She kissed him quickly.

462
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,280
'Good night, Clark.'

463
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,360
She ran into the house.

464
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
Clark was very happy.

465
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,360
But there was someone at Lana's house.

466
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,320
He saw the kiss and he was very angry.

467
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,680
It was Whitney Fordman.

468
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,360
The next day before school, Clark drove the red car back to Lex
Luthor's house.

469
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,880
The house was big and old.

470
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,760
The front door was open.

471
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,400
Clark walked in.

472
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,880
'Hello!' he shouted.

473
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,760
'Is anyone at home?'

474
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,920
'Clark,' said Lex.

475
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,560
'What are you doing here?

476
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,200
How's your new car?'

477
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,720
'I love it,' said Clark.

478
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,760
'But I can't keep it.'

479
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,520
'Why not?

480
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,000
You saved my life, Clark.

481
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,240
I want to thank you,' Lex said.

482
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,880
Then he said, 'Oh, I get it.

483
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,720
Your dad doesn't like me.'

484
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,920
Clark didn't say anything.

485
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,880
'It's OK,' said Lex, 'I understand.'

486
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,120
'It's not you,' said Clark.

487
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,320
'He doesn't like your father.

488
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,800
Thank you for the car, Lex.

489
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,840
I'm sorry I can't keep it.'

490
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,600
'I changed after that crash,' said Lex.

491
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
'When I was under the water...

492
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,680
I saw my life in Smallville in a new way.

493
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:32,080
I can see now... this isn't the end of my old life in Metropolis...
it's the start of my new life here.

494
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,280
So, thank you, Clark.

495
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:46,800
I hope we can be friends for a long time.'

496
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,880
CHAPTER SEVEN

497
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,120
This year's scarecrow

498
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,800
When school finished that afternoon, Chloe and Pete went into
town.

499
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,920
There were people and police cars in front of one of the shops.


500
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
And a man was on the ground.

501
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,160
'What happened here?' asked Chloe.

502
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,480
'It's Freddie Post.

503
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,640
He had a big electric shock,' said a man.

504
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,080
Chloe turned to Pete.

505
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,640
'He's the third one this week,' she said.

506
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,200
'And here's something interesting.

507
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,600
They were all in the school football team in 1989.'

508
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Pete looked at the people by the body.

509
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,480
He saw a teenage boy.

510
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,560
'Who's that boy?' he asked.

511
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,280
'I don't know,' said Chloe.

512
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,680
She quickly took a photo of him.

513
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,720
The two friends walked back to the school and went to the newspaper
room.

514
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,760
'I'm going to put this photo into the computer,' she said.

515
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,400
'Can you find the 1989 yearbook, Pete?'

516
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,000
A few minutes later Pete sat next to Chloe with the book.

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,520
'Chloe, look!' he said.

518
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
'This boy, twelve years ago.

519
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,480
His name's Jeremy Creek.'

520
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Chloe looked at the book and then at her photo.

521
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,640
'It's the same person,' she said.

522
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,280
'And he's the same age.

523
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,400
That's interesting!'

524
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Chloe and Pete used the Internet and wrote emails.

525
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,360
They found old newspapers.

526
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,640
'I'm going to find Clark,' said Pete.

527
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,840
'We must tell him about this.'

528
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,800
Pete came back with Clark.

529
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,840
Clark looked at the two photos of Jeremy Creek.

530
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,120
'Jeremy had a big electric shock twelve years ago,' said Chloe.


531
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,320
'He was in hospital for twelve years.

532
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,080
A few days ago he woke up and ran away.'

533
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,840
'So why is he back in Smallville?' asked Clark.

534
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,000
'Why is he giving electric shocks to people?'

535
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,200
'Because twelve years ago,' Pete said, 'they put him on a pole
in a field.

536
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,480
He was that year's scarecrow!'

537
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,600
'The meteors crashed into Smallville that day!' said Chloe.

538
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,680
Oh no! thought Clark.

539
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,320
All this happened because of me!

540
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,920
That was the day of my arrival.

541
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,560
He looked at a photo in one of the old newspapers.

542
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,160
It was a little girl.

543
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,960
She had a terrible look on her face.

544
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,280
It said under the photo, Meteor hits mom and dad.

545
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,800
'So what do you think, Clark?' asked Chloe.

546
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,960
Clark knew that little face in the photo.

547
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
'Oh no! Lana!'

548
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,400
'Why didn't you tell me about this before?' he shouted.

549
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,080
'I did this!'

550
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
He ran from the room.

551
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,160
In front of the school, he met Whitney.

552
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,760
'Hi, Clark,' said Whitney.

553
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,400
'I'm looking for you.

554
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,680
You're this year's scarecrow!'

555
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,720
'Leave me alone, Whitney,' said Clark angrily, 'or I'm going
to...'

556
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,520
'You're going to what?' said Whitney.

557
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,080
'Come on, Clark.

558
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,960
Hit me!'

559
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,720
He took off his jacket.

560
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,640
Clark moved nearer to Whitney but he suddenly started to fall.


561
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,400
He saw Lana's green necklace under Whitney's open T-shirt.

562
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,960
'What's between you and Lana?' shouted Whitney.

563
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,160
'You can have her necklace!'

564
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,800
He took off the necklace and put it on Clark.

565
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,840
'But you can't have Lana!

566
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm taking her to the dance tonight.'

567
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,720
Clark didn't feel well.

568
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,440
He tried to move.

569
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,600
And then everything went black.

570
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Whitney and two of his friends put him in a car.

571
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,440
Jeremy Creek watched everything.

572
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:08,640
And he remembered this day, twelve years ago.

573
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,440
CHAPTER EIGHT

574
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,880
A big red S

575
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Clark woke up.

576
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,760
He was in a cornfield, on a pole.

577
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,680
He was very cold.

578
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,480
It was night and it was October.

579
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,080
He looked down.

580
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,720
There was a big red S on the front of his body.

581
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,200
He tried to move his arms.

582
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
I can't move.

583
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,520
What's wrong with me? he thought.

584
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,480
It's the necklace!

585
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,560
Suddenly there was a boy in front of him.

586
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,800
'It hurts,' said the boy.

587
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,520
'I remember that.'

588
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,880
'You're Jeremy Creek,' said Clark.

589
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,400
'No.

590
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,480
Jeremy Creek died twelve years ago,' said the boy.

591
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,720
He started to walk away.

592
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,120
'Where are you going?' asked Clark.

593
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,120
'To the school dance,' said Jeremy.

594
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,960
'I didn't go in 1989.'

595
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,040
'Please help me,' said Clark.

596
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,520
'No,' Jeremy said.

597
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,320
'You stay here.

598
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,560
I don't want to hurt you.'

599
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,840
Jeremy walked down the road.

600
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
Lex Luthor drove by and saw him.

601
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,920
'I know that boy,' he thought.

602
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,120
'But how?

603
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,320
From where?'

604
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,560
He stopped the car.

605
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,720
Then he remembered the field twelve years ago.

606
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,200
The boy on the pole.

607
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,120
The big red S.

608
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,600
He got out of the car and went into the field.

609
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,360
'Help me,' he heard.

610
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,320
'Help me, please.'

611
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,400
It's not possible, Lex thought.

612
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,160
Then he saw him.

613
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,200
'Clark!' he shouted.

614
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,520
Lex helped Clark.

615
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,760
Clark pulled off the necklace.

616
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,040
'You need a doctor, Clark,' Lex said.

617
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,600
Without the necklace, Clark was suddenly Clark again.

618
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,720
He didn't need a doctor.

619
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,440
'I'm OK.

620
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,760
Thanks, Lex,' he said.

621
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,040
He found his clothes and ran into the night.

622
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,080
Lex saw the necklace on the ground.

623
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,080
He put it in his jacket and walked back to his car.

624
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,600
At the school dance, the band played and everyone danced.

625
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,280
Jeremy Creek didn't dance.

626
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,680
He was behind the school building.

627
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,920
He opened the door of a large box.

628
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,080
WATER, it said.

629
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,600
They're all going to die now, he thought.

630
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,400
Suddenly Clark was behind him.

631
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,480
'Stop this now, Jeremy,' he said.

632
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,880
'You!' said Jeremy.

633
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,720
'What are you doing here?'

634
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,280
'You're not going to hurt my friends,' said Clark.

635
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,440
'You don't understand,' said Jeremy.

636
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,400
'I'm doing this for you and the others.

637
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,720
No more scarecrows!'

638
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,080
'No, Jeremy.

639
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,040
Stop it,' said Clark.

640
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,360
Jeremy hit Clark in the face but he had a surprise.

641
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Clark wasn't hurt.

642
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,480
There was a car next to Jeremy.

643
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,800
He opened the door and started it.

644
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,400
He drove at Clark.

645
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,000
Clark put his arms in front of him, but Jeremy didn't stop.

646
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,960
Clark was on the front of the car when it hit the Water box.

647
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,240
There was water everywhere.

648
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,360
It gave Jeremy a big electric shock.

649
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,040
His body was blue.

650
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,400
Then everything was quiet.

651
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,360
Clark pulled the car door.

652
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
It opened.

653
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,200
'Are you OK?' he asked.

654
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,240
'Who are you?' asked Jeremy.

655
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,160
'I want to go home.'

656
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,200
Clark watched the end of the homecoming dance.

657
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,480
Lana and Whitney danced in the centre of the room.

658
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Then they kissed.

659
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,040
A long kiss.

660
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,120
Clark was sad.

661
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,080
He turned and left.

662
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,360
There were three cars in a line in the car park.

663
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,040
That's Whitney's car and his friends' cars, Clark thought.

664
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,920
He had an idea.

665
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,160
He took one car and put it on top of another one.

666
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,680
Then he took the third car and put it on top of the other two.


667
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,000
He waited.

668
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,800
When students came out and saw the cars, they laughed.

669
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Then Whitney came out, with his arm around Lana.

670
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,640
He saw his car.

671
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,800
'Who did this to my car?' he shouted angrily.

672
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Everyone laughed and Lana smiled.

673
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,240
EPILOGUE

674
00:36:48,240 --> 00:37:03,520
'Thanks for the dance'

675
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,120
'Clark,' called Jonathan when he came home.

676
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,760
'Lex was here.

677
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,240
This is for you.'

678
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,040
He gave Clark a small box and a letter.

679
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,120
Lana's necklace was in the box.

680
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,960
Clark read the letter.

681
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,000
I found this necklace in the cornfield, Clark.

682
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,880
We are friends now, so please keep this box.

683
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,000
My mother gave it to me many years ago.

684
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,840
It's very special.

685
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,160
Lex.

686
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,800
Clark opened the box and saw the necklace.

687
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,040
He didn't feel well.

688
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,080
He closed the box again, and he was OK.

689
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,520
It was a special box.

690
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,920
'I must remember that,' he thought.

691
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,480
'Hello, Clark.'

692
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,800
It was Lana.

693
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,280
In his room in the barn.

694
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,840
'Lana!' he said, surprised.

695
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,600
'What are you doing here?'

696
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,000
'You didn't come to the dance,' she said.

697
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,240
She walked up to him and put her arms around him.

698
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,400
'Let's dance now.'

699
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,240
They danced to the music.

700
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,560
Clark closed his eyes.

701
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,960
Suddenly he heard a car.

702
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,640
He opened his eyes.

703
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,520
Lana wasn't there.

704
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,720
It was a daydream.

705
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,520
He looked through the window.

706
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,040
A car arrived at Lana's house.

707
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
'The necklace!'

708
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,680
Clark took it to Lana's house.

709
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,800
He put it on her front door.

710
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,720
He was back in his room before Lana opened the car door.

711
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,560
He moved faster than the wind and nobody saw him.

712
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,440
When Lana arrived at her front door, she saw the necklace.

713
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,720
She took it and put it on.

714
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,480
Oh Whitney, you are fantastic, she thought.

715
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:10,320
'Good night, Lana,' Clark said quietly.

716
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,428
'Thanks for the dance.'
