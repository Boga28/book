1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:09,430
Juanantes Dios Rodrigues was a poor farmer.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,019
He was a good man, a good husband.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,670
He worked hard and lived a simple life.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,740
One night Juanantes took a bottle of whiskey
to the field behind his house.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,920
He didn't usually drink alcohol.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,289
He hated the taste, although people said it
was better than most other pleasures in life.

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,650
Some people had even found the "good light"
after drinking alcohol.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,682
A person who experienced the "good light"
was able to leave this earth and, for a short

9
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:44,570
time, stay between two worlds, in a place
where death couldn't touch them.

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,219
This light meant good health, long life, happiness,
good business.

11
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,750
Everyone searched for this light.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,640
But Juanantes didn't drink - until that night.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,870
There was no reason for his drinking - nothing
to celebrate, no anger to drown, or sadness

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,870
to forget.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,040
But he couldn't fight his desire on that night.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,380
When he had finished the bottle, he heard
a voice.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,530
The voice commanded him to go to the top of
a mountain called the Hill of Sand on the

18
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,600
first Tuesday of the ninth month, at midnight.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,090
There he would find a large fire in the forest.

20
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,439
He would see a bag by the fire.

21
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,680
He had to approach the fire and pick up the
bag before the fire burned it.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,990
Inside the bag there would be treasure and
something else, a mandate.

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,340
He had to do exactly what the mandate ordered
him to do.

24
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,390
On the first Tuesday of the ninth month his
wife, Cardenala, went with him to the Hill

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,390
of Sand.

26
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,439
They left at midnight, as the voice had instructed,
and walked through the forest.

27
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,860
They were afraid but excited at the same time.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,650
The noises of the night were all around them.

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,860
Eyes shone in the dark, watching them.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,520
Juanantes had told Cardenala about the voice
during a moment of weakness, as he lay there

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,190
recovering from his night of drinking.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,030
He knew now, as she pushed him forward in
the darkness, that it had been a mistake to

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,080
tell Cardenala.

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,300
Since he had told her about the voice, he
had had no peace.

35
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,780
He couldn't work.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,970
His farm and his animals had suffered.

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,300
Cardenala wouldn't leave him alone, day or
night.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,440
Even in silence they knew each others thoughts.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,970
To him the mysterious voice he had heard was
like an evil curse.

40
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,750
But not to Cardenala.

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,110
To her it was a way of escaping from their
poverty, the way to the "good light."

42
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,890
Juanantes wanted the treasure but at the same
time he feared it.

43
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,940
He wasn't sure he should do what the voice
had commanded.

44
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,060
But Cardenala's desire infected him.

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,250
She decided for both of them.

46
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,430
They would go to the Hill of Sand.

47
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,810
They would do exactly what the voice had told
them to do.

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,670
They would find the treasure.

49
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,810
She planned.

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,810
She worried.

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,260
If the bag contained money, how would they
spend it?

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,250
If it contained jewels, who could they sell
them to?

53
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,200
She woke him up with her fears.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,890
"The police might ask questions.

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,330
If there's gold in the bag, what will we do?"

56
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,421
The more she pushed, the more full of doubt
he became.

57
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:34,310
"I may be poor, but at least I'm happy," he
told her.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,830
She called him a coward and threatened to
go alone.

59
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,140
So they went together on that dark night.

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,750
At one point Cardenala wanted to turn back.

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,950
She suddenly had a black thought.

62
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,560
She could see danger waiting for them.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,269
She called to Juanantes, but it was too late.

64
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,950
He didn't hear her.

65
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,480
He didn't answer.

66
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,000
He didn't even turn his head.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,200
There was no moon.

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,780
Cardenala could only see his white hat in
the darkness.

69
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,450
He walked on without stopping, without thinking.

70
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,480
He wasn't cautious or indecisive now.

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,720
There was another Juanantes inside his skin,
fingers holding tightly onto his machete,

72
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,019
eyes staring.

73
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,870
What had caused this change in him?

74
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,540
What was driving him forward?

75
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,760
At last they came to the fire, an enormous,
blinding fire.

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,060
Juanantes waited for a moment, silent, thinking.

77
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,720
Should they turn around?

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,250
Could they escape this?

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,229
Forget it had ever happened?

80
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,539
Cardenala said nothing.

81
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:45,820
Then Juanantes rushed forward and saw, where
the voice had told him it would be, an old

82
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,570
cloth bag.

83
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,640
He quickly took the bag, almost burning his
face in the flames, and returned to Cardenala.

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,910
Suddenly ambitious again and filled with curiosity
about what was in the bag, he took Cardenala's

85
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,669
hand and they ran from the place.

86
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,190
They could see nothing in the darkness.

87
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,120
They felt the outside of the bag.

88
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,380
Bones?

89
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,190
And something heavier, with a weight like
metal.

90
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,350
Juanantes opened it and felt inside.

91
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:24,030
It was impossible to see but yes, there 'were
the bones of a man, a machete, and in a smaller

92
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,520
bag, a bottle of whiskey and some gold coins.

93
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,550
Was this the treasure of the dead?

94
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,759
It was all a mystery.

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,220
He found a metal box and opened it.

96
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,310
Inside he could feel some kind of paper - a
document.

97
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,669
This must be the mandate.

98
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,340
The events of later that night have never
been fully understood.

99
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,000
In the early hours, when it was still dark,
as Cardenala lay sleeping in their bedroom,

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,620
Juanantes opened the metal box and read the
mandate.

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,410
The mandate told him to kill a man, Prudencio
Salvatierra.

102
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,440
Kill?

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,100
Juanantes shook with fear.

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,419
He left quietly and went to a bar to have
a drink.

105
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,199
He needed a drink now, to calm himself.

106
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,150
He needed to think.

107
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,280
He was lifting his glass to his mouth when
he heard someone say the name of Prudencio

108
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,120
Salvatierra.

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,130
The sound of that name filled him with hatred.

110
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,100
His glass crashed to the floor.

111
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,430
He couldn't see.

112
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,930
He couldn't think.

113
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,290
He wanted this man's blood.

114
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,220
He had to spill this man's blood!

115
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,979
He pulled out his machete and rushed toward
Prudencio Salvatierra.

116
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,340
"Fight or be killed like a dog!" he shouted.

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,770
Prudencio pulled out his machete.

118
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,770
"Who are you?

119
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,110
What do you want with me?"

120
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,230
Juanantes attacked him.

121
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,699
There were screams.

122
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:55,840
People were running.

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,000
Tables and chairs were knocked over as people
crowded around to watch.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,780
Juanantes was wild, with the strength of ten
men.

125
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,370
His machete came down again and again on Prudencio
Salvatierra until the bar was red with his

126
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,940
blood.

127
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,669
Prudencio had no chance.

128
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,009
Within minutes he lay dead, his body in pieces.

129
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:26,040
Later, Juanantes was questioned again and
again by the judge.

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,910
Why had he fought with Prudencio Salvatierra?

131
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,380
Juanantes could give no answer.

132
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,310
There was no logic.

133
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,009
No, they had never met before.

134
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,740
No, he was not an enemy - until that night.

135
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,500
Until the moment when Juanantes heard his
name, the name he recognized, the name that

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,410
was written in the mandate.

137
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,090
Juanantes was found guilty of murder and sent
to prison for ten years.

138
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,000
Cardenala found employment as a servant near
the prison, so that she could visit Juanantes

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,060
every Sunday.

140
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,389
After many Sundays they began to talk of when
Juanantes would be freed.

141
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,870
"What are you going to do?" asked Cardenala.

142
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,880
Juanantes heard her words again and again
in his mind.

143
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,169
What are you going to do?

144
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,450
What are you...?

145
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,979
Not we.

146
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,949
He looked hard at Cardenala, as a policeman
looks at a suspect, searching for signs.

147
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,070
Was she planning to stay in the city?

148
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,849
Was there another man?

149
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,130
"Tell me, Cardenala.

150
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,940
Aren't you coming back with me?"

151
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,690
"No."

152
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,320
Her quiet answer, her guilt, hit him.

153
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
For a moment he couldn't speak.

154
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,540
"All right.

155
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,000
All right.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,350
But I must go back to our village.

157
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,980
You know that, don't you?"

158
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,050
"Yes, I know.

159
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,510
But I don't care what you say.

160
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,750
I'm not going with you.

161
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,399
I went to see the priest.

162
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,130
He told me it was the work of the devil.

163
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,380
I'm not going to fall into that trap again."

164
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,310
"The priest?

165
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,160
Why did you go to the priest?" he asked her.

166
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,769
"My boss wanted me to.

167
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,640
He was worried about me.

168
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,070
He's very kind to me."

169
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,279
Juanantes knew it then.

170
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,570
He knew that he was losing Cardenala.

171
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,050
Prison was bad, like a kind of death.

172
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,750
Four walls.

173
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,890
Always the same four walls.

174
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,500
The desperate faces.

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
The waiting.

176
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,720
The long, lonely nights.

177
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,040
But losing Cardenala?

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,269
No.

179
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,510
Impossible.

180
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,980
There was nothing he could do, though.

181
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,950
When the evil light has fallen on a man, everything
goes wrong.

182
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,209
He would have to go back to their village
alone.

183
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,750
The following Sunday Cardenala came to visit
as usual.

184
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,330
"You've come," he said.

185
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,910
"Of course I've come.

186
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,500
What do you mean?"

187
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,100
"Well, I thought..."

188
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,120
"You thought!

189
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,710
You thought!

190
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,570
You think too much!"

191
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,440
laughed Cardenala.

192
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,020
In her mouth a new gold tooth shone.

193
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,540
"And this tooth?" asked Juanantes.

194
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,019
"Oh, my boss paid for it."

195
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,390
"Your boss again.

196
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,829
And you paid him back?"

197
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,149
"Of course.

198
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:25,560
Stop questioning me!"

199
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,490
Juanantes asked again.

200
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,079
"Are you coming back with me?"

201
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
"No, Juanantes."

202
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
Short and sharp.

203
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,640
It cut his heart.

204
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,190
"Well, at least..."

205
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,560
He stopped.

206
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,180
His voice left him.

207
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,210
"At least this way I know," he finally managed
to say.

208
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,040
"These things happen to people who have swallowed
the evil light."

209
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,560
His sad eyes grew hard as he watched Cardenala's
face.

210
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,329
On his last day he gathered his few remaining
possessions - a few clothes, old and full

211
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:04,829
of holes now, and the torn pieces of a picture
of Cardenala.

212
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,760
He had torn the picture up, put it back together,
torn it up, so many times.

213
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,330
But still he saved the pieces.

214
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,910
He went to a hotel to stay that night and
filled in the form at reception with his full

215
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,260
name, Juanantes Dios Rodriguez.

216
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,320
Then he left with no explanation.

217
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Why?

218
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
The keys!

219
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,959
Those large, heavy room keys reminded him
of his prison cell, of hundreds of cells.

220
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,380
He wandered around without sleeping or eating
until his stomach ached with hunger.

221
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,730
But he couldn't sit in the cafe, where people
stood in line like prisoners.

222
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,800
So he walked along the dusty road toward the
mountains.

223
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,310
He knew something still had to be done.

224
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,570
He had killed Prudencio Salvatierra ten long
years ago.

225
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,190
Now he had to obey the mandate's final order.

226
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,339
He went to where he had been living with Cardenala.

227
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,220
Nothing had changed.

228
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,940
Everything was as it had always been.

229
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,720
The trees, the rocks.

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,000
It even seemed that the same old dogs still,
now, after ten years, slept in the sun.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,269
Juanantes felt full of sorrow.

232
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,100
But he wasn't doing anything.

233
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,330
He wasn't living.

234
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:31,480
And so, without further thought, he called
on the wise old man, Tata Guamarachito, for

235
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
help.

236
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,600
"It's no good being in this condition," the
old man told Juanantes.

237
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,529
"You're good for nothing.

238
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,529
Nothing goes right.

239
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,529
I know why you're suffering.

240
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,410
As a young man the same thing happened to
me.

241
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,470
Yes, I can help you.

242
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,370
I can help you understand what you're dealing
with.

243
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,740
I can advise you about what you have to do."

244
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,480
"But I don't want to do what the mandate ordered!"

245
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,839
shouted Juanantes.

246
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,570
"I have no enemies."

247
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,090
"It's not necessary to have an enemy."

248
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,470
"Yes, but to bury the evil light, this evil
light, which by accident or pure bad luck

249
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,620
I've fallen into, I know that I have to write
a mandate, an order to kill someone.

250
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,740
I have to put that into the metal box.

251
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,340
But I keep telling you: I have no one to kill!

252
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,040
It's hopeless anyway.

253
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,870
The evil light has entered my body, like sand.

254
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,089
I cough.

255
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,940
I even cough blood!

256
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
It's in me.

257
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,720
It got into me in prison.

258
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,740
I..."

259
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,540
As he was speaking he lost control and fell,
coughing, to the ground.

260
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,390
But the old man was still not persuaded.

261
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,839
"How do you know it's the evil light?" he
asked calmly.

262
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,420
Juanantes told him that pieces of the evil
light were everywhere.

263
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,170
He saw them clearly, dancing around him, causing
him to cough, giving him night fevers.

264
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,750
"Then get away from them," was the old man's
advice.

265
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,890
But Juanantes asked again, with anger now,
"How can I do this if I have no enemies?"

266
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,290
"Calm down.

267
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm only trying to help.

268
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,149
And don't blame yourself so much.

269
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,470
You've paid your debt in prison for killing
Salvatierra.

270
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,200
You killed fairly.

271
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,339
The two of you faced each other as men, with
machetes.

272
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,200
Salvatierra died and you lived.

273
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,279
If you hadn't followed the mandate to kill
someone, you would have been killed yourself.

274
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
Because it was written.'

275
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,699
But Juanantes was still unhappy.

276
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,730
"It would be better if I were dead."

277
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,470
"Don't talk like that.

278
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,060
In my experience it's never better to be dead
than alive."

279
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,060
"What has to be done then?

280
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,440
What must I do?"

281
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,509
"You must light the fire of evil light and
write your own mandate to put into the metal

282
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:00,940
box by the fire."

283
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,199
"But I've told you.

284
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:05,339
I can't write this mandate."

285
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:11,529
"Juanantes, if you let me, I'll show you a
way to break the chain of death, the chain

286
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,269
which has caught you."

287
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,279
"No, Tata.

288
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,089
If I break the chain of death, it will only
bring me more tragedy.

289
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:20,690
More sorrow!

290
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,690
I..."

291
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,850
The old man interrupted.

292
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,540
" The evil light that's around you is responsible
for many deaths.

293
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,779
It's time to put an end to it.

294
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,190
I've told you that I can show you how to break
this chain.

295
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,290
Be brave.

296
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,420
Believe in me.

297
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,779
Write your own mandate.

298
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,880
Use your own words.

299
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,910
The words of Juanantes Dios Rodriguez, a man
of honor.

300
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,890
Then we'll do together what has to be done."

301
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,829
They arranged to meet in nine weeks, when
the night would be at its blackest.

302
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,509
On that night they waited, hidden behind some
trees.

303
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:06,519
They heard the sound of a horse coming, slowly,
cautiously.

304
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,810
Juanantes lit the fire.

305
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,170
The horse and rider slowly approached the
fire.

306
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,529
The rider got down, with his gun in his hand.

307
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,420
A moment passed.

308
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,720
There was silence.

309
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,110
Then the rider rushed toward the fire, took
the bag which Tata Guamarachito and Juanantes

310
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,890
had left there, jumped onto his horse, and
rode away into the night.

311
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,910
"See how simple it was," said Tata Guamarachito,
throwing his arm around Juanantes's shoulder.

312
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,250
"Look at you!

313
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,900
Already the evil light is leaving you.

314
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,769
The sadness is lifting.

315
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,030
But have you broken the chain of death?

316
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:55,350
The bones, your machete - the same machete
you used to kill Salvatierra - the bottle

317
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,220
of whiskey, the gold, were all there in the
bag.

318
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,540
But you didn't order anyone to be killed.

319
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,780
So what did you order instead?

320
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,339
What did you write on that piece of paper,
with your signature, which you put in the

321
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,780
metal box?"

322
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,170
"That one thing I can't tell you.

323
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,630
It's my secret."

324
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,449
"But you didn't order anyone to be killed?"

325
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:20,449
"No.

326
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,890
I told you, I couldn't.

327
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,669
I have no enemies."

328
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,650
"Then what was your order?"

329
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,270
"I repeat, Tata, that's my secret."

330
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,270
"All right.

331
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,150
I respect that."

332
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,390
"Please forgive me, Tata."

333
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,670
"There's no need.

334
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,710
Men with secrets are always interesting to
me.

335
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,429
But let me tell you.

336
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:49,280
You're breaking a chain, a chain that has
caused many deaths and destroyed many lives.

337
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
I'm..."

338
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,590
Tata Guamarachito coughed, the heavy cough
of a smoker.

339
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,659
"I'm close to 100 years old.

340
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:01,130
But when I was your age...

341
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,679
How old are you?

342
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,620
About thirty?

343
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,010
When I was your age, I fell into the evil
light.

344
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:15,970
I was ordered to kill a man, Belisario Consuegra,
a man I had never met.

345
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,620
A man I had never seen.

346
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:23,870
But one day, I was at a market buying a horse
and I heard someone shouting, 'Belisario!

347
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,480
Belisario Consuegra!'

348
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,210
My blood turned cold.

349
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,250
I couldn't see or hear.

350
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:37,750
I took out my machete, found him, and ordered
him to defend himself or be killed like an

351
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,800
animal.

352
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
He fought.

353
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,100
But I killed him.

354
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,429
I cut him into pieces.

355
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:46,000
The smell of his blood made me crazy."

356
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,049
"But did you bury your evil light with a mandate?"

357
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,510
"Yes, Juanantes.

358
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,960
There was a man, a Mexican, my enemy.

359
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,400
My mandate was found by Placido Salgaespera,
and Salgaespera killed the Mexican with his

360
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,710
machete.

361
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:12,680
Salgaespera's mandate was then found by Remigio
Huertas, who killed Salgaespera's enemy, and

362
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,790
it has continued in this way.

363
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,980
Say that you've broken the chain, Juanantes.

364
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,120
Tell me this."

365
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,220
But Juanantes only sat silently watching the
sunrise.

366
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,390
He always watched the sunrise, but had never
liked the morning.

367
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:36,669
Now, however, freed from the evil light, it
seemed to be the most beautiful dawn he could

368
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:38,419
ever experience.

369
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,700
Suddenly he wanted Cardenala.

370
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,480
He wanted her so badly.

371
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,510
But he stopped these thoughts as soon as they
began.

372
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,340
Why should he want her?

373
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,390
He knew now that Cardenala was part of the
evil light which had brought him to this place.

374
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,130
Because of her, Prudencio Salvatierra now
lay cold in the ground.

375
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:08,150
When the sun had fully risen, he offered Tata
Guamarachito payment for his services.

376
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,710
The old man wouldn't accept money.

377
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,880
"I want only to know your secret.

378
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,870
The mandate that the horseman read."

379
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:21,560
But without speaking, Juanantes walked away.

380
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,580
He was going down the mountain when he suddenly
changed his mind, turned, and started back

381
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,559
toward Tata Guamarachito.

382
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,330
Walking, then running, shouting, "Tata!

383
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,330
Wait!

384
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,330
I will!

385
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,870
I will share my secret with you!"

386
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,400
When he reached the place where they had sat,
he bent down and whispered in the old man's

387
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
ear.

388
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,230
"Is that true?

389
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:52,100
Was that really your mandate?" asked the old
man, smiling, trying to hold back his tears

390
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,720
of joy.

391
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,030
"Yes.

392
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,330
Yes.

393
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:01,430
That she too would be torn up when the picture
was torn up.

394
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:09,370
Now I know, Tata, that when I tore up Cardenala's
picture in prison it began to free me, to

395
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,190
free me from her evil power.

396
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,980
Woman, when she goes bad, is the worst of
all evil lights.

397
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:25,539
Because of this, my mandate ordered the unknown
rider to take the picture of the first person

398
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:33,350
with an untrue heart that he found, the first
unfaithful friend or lover, and tear it into

399
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,169
pieces.

400
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,540
There are many ways of destroying someone."
