1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:04,259
Beyond the Wall

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,400
I was born in the United States, but I lived
in Hong Kong for many years.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,910
My business in Asia was successful and I became
rich.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,800
After twenty years, I decided to visit my
home in New York.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,010
On my way from Hong Kong to New York, I stayed
one week in California.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:35,210
I had a friend who lived in the city of San
Francisco and I wanted to see him again.

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,520
His name was Mohun Dampier and he had been
my friend for many years.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,170
We had written many letters to each other.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,559
But recently, I had not received any news
from him.

10
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,950
Dampier had never had a job.

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:01,390
His father gave him a little money, so Dampier
had never worked.

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,110
Dampier was a superstitious man.

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,780
He believed that luck or magic could make
things happen in his life.

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,040
He spent most of his time reading books-strange
books.

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Most of the books were about occult philosophy.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,490
I called them books about magic.

17
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,780
As soon as I arrived in San Francisco, I sent
a message to Dampier's house.

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,200
The message said: I am staying in San Francisco
for three days.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,270
May I visit you?

20
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,570
Dampier surprised me.

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,939
An hour later, he sent a servant to my hotel
with a reply.

22
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,990
Come to my house at once, my dear friend,
he wrote.

23
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,000
Come this evening.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,420
You'll remember the house-'I'm sure.

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,740
It was my fathers' home.

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,060
I live in a tower at one end of the house.

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,349
You don't have to ring the bell or knock on
the door.

28
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,999
Il tell the servants to go to bed.

29
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,459
And I'll leave the front door of the tower
open.

30
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,920
Come up the stairs immediately.

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,840
I'll he waiting for you.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,810
Please come soon.

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,030
I rode in a cab to Dampier's house.

34
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,639
That evening, the weather was stormy.

35
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,620
A strong wind was blowing and cold rain was
falling.

36
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,819
I had forgotten that California is cold and
wet in winter.

37
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:52,730
I only remembered the sunshine, not the wind
and the rain.

38
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,129
Dampier's house was near the Pacific Ocean.

39
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,280
It was an ugly, two-story building that was
made of bricks.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,049
There was a tower at one end.

41
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,260
The house was surrounded by a garden of many
trees and beautiful plants.

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,569
But now it was winter and there were no leaves
on the trees or flowers on the plants.

43
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,239
The driver stopped his cab near the tower.

44
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,469
Although the front door was only five yards
away, I became soaked with rain as soon as

45
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,549
I stepped out of the cab.

46
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,129
I ran to the door of the tower and turned
the handle.

47
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,620
The door was unlocked and I opened it.

48
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,260
One small lamp burned on the stairway and
it did not give much light.

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,269
The hall was full of shadows and I could not
see clearly.

50
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,279
I climbed the stairs slowly, touching the
wall with my fingers.

51
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:06,209
At the top of the stairs there was another
door.

52
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,099
I opened it and went into a room that was
lit with another small lamp.

53
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,419
Dampier came forward, held my hand and shook
it.

54
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:24,150
He was wearing a long silk coat and soft leather
slippers on his feet.

55
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,930
His clothes were old-fashioned and strange.

56
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,110
We looked at each other and I was shocked.

57
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,819
I had not seen Dampier for many years.

58
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,030
My friend had changed a lot!

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:48,319
He had been a handsome man but now his hair
was gray and his face was very pale.

60
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,240
There were many lines around his eyes and
mouth.

61
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Dampier looked like a thin old man, but he
was not older than fifty.

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,979
His large and bright eyes shone strangely
in the shadowy room.

63
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,590
"Welcome, my friend!

64
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,789
Please sit down," he said.

65
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:19,840
Dampier offered me some wine and a cigar and
we talked a little.

66
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,090
But I am afraid that our conversation was
not very interesting.

67
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:32,719
Meeting friends after many years can be difficult
and it can make you sad.

68
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,240
Maybe Dampier guessed my thoughts.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:45,879
"Non sum qualis eram-I'm not as I was," he
said.

70
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,300
I tried to make a joke.

71
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,849
"Your Latin hasn't improved," I replied.

72
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,099
My friend smiled.

73
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:04,830
"Latin is a dead language and I'm a dead man,"
he said.

74
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:13,770
Then his smile disappeared and he said, "I'll
die very soon."

75
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,770
I did not know what to say.

76
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,210
I smoked my cigar and drank my wine.

77
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,449
We were both silent for several minutes.

78
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,160
Outside, the wind had stopped blowing.

79
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,159
I wanted to leave the house.

80
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,259
Suddenly I heard a strange noise.

81
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,259
TAP.

82
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,259
TAP.

83
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,259
TAP.

84
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:45,139
It was the sound of someone, or something,
knocking.

85
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,530
Was the sound coming from one wall of the
tower?

86
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,639
TAP.

87
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,749
TAP.

88
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:51,860
TAP.

89
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,110
The sound was not quick or loud.

90
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,749
It was not the sound of someone knocking loudly
on a door.

91
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:10,499
The soft tapping sounded like someone sending
a signal-a message.

92
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,819
Dampier had forgotten me.

93
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,990
He was staring at the wall.

94
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,659
There was a strange expression on his face.

95
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,870
My friend looked excited and afraid.

96
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,160
His eyes shone brightly.

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,380
I did not know what to do.

98
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,710
Should I go or stay?

99
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,280
I stood up.

100
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,599
"I-I see that you are very tired," I said.

101
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,719
"I'll leave.

102
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:48,500
May I visit you tomorrow?"

103
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,789
Dampier turned his head and looked at me.

104
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:55,509
"Please stay," he said.

105
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,529
"There's no problem.

106
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,559
Nobody is there."

107
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,710
He walked to a small window and opened it.

108
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,309
I had not noticed' the window earlier.

109
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:13,199
"Look," he said.

110
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,599
I walked across the room and looked out of
the window.

111
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,749
I could see nothing except the light of a
street lamp and rain falling.

112
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:26,970
No one was standing outside.

113
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,050
There was no one near the wall of the tower.

114
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,510
"Please don't leave me," said Dampier.

115
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,700
"I must tell you a story.

116
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,000
You're the only man that I can tell it to.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,300
Will you listen to my story?"

118
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,130
I wanted to go back to my hotel.

119
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:57,430
Dampier, his house and the strange noise made
me feel uncomfortable.

120
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,199
I think that I am a sensible and intelligent
man.

121
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,840
But I felt unhappy and frightened in that
old tower room.

122
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,970
However, I did not want to upset my old friend.

123
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,710
"Very well," I said.

124
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,490
"I'll stay and listen."

125
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:25,149
Dampier poured me another drink and offered
me another cigar.

126
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,000
Then he began to tell his story.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,720
"I didn't move into this house until my father
died," Dampier said.

128
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,370
"That was ten years ago, when I was about
forty years old.

129
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,110
When my father died, I got his business, his
property and his money.

130
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:58,330
"Before his death, I lived in a large apartment
building on Rincon Hill," said Dampier.

131
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,610
"Maybe you know that area of San Francisco?

132
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:11,509
Rincon Hill was a fashionable area fifty years
ago, but now it is run-down and neglected.

133
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:18,390
The owner of the apartment building rented
out many of its small rooms.

134
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,750
The walls of the rooms were thin.

135
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,389
You could almost put your hand through them.

136
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:29,389
"I was lucky," Dampier went on.

137
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:34,880
"The rent was cheap and I had a large room
in the building.

138
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,220
No one visited me.

139
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,810
And no one disturbed me-I could study my books
quietly.

140
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,940
I lived happily on Rincon Hill.

141
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:54,940
"One morning, as I was leaving the apartment,
I saw a young girl," Dampier continued.

142
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,640
"It was a warm day in June.

143
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,509
She was wearing a white dress and a straw
hat.

144
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:10,759
There were brightly-colored flowers and ribbons
around the brim of the hat.

145
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,050
Then I saw the girls face.

146
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,540
It's difficult to find words to describe it.

147
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,009
Her face was strange and beautiful.

148
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,230
I had never seen such a beautiful face before.

149
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:33,649
Without thinking, I lifted my hat and bowed.

150
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:40,230
She looked at me with shining brown eyes,
but she didn't speak.

151
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,820
I knew that she was pleased to see me, but
she didn't smile.

152
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,050
She went into the house and shut the door.

153
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,269
I stood and stared at the closed door.

154
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,589
Would I see her again?

155
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,740
Should I speak to her?

156
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,070
Would she speak to me?

157
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:10,889
"Maybe you think that these are the thoughts
of a much younger man," said Dampier.

158
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,590
"And maybe you're right.

159
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,400
But these feelings were new to me.

160
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,959
I'd never been in love before.

161
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:28,470
I'd spent too many years with books and too
little time with people.

162
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,899
Now I believe that you're my only friend.

163
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:37,430
Soon, none of this will matter.

164
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,209
I don't feel foolish when I talk to you."

165
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:48,600
Dampier stopped speaking for a few moments,
then he went on with his story.

166
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,490
"The next day, I waited in my apartment.

167
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,339
For many hours, I stared out of the window.

168
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:04,339
I watched the street, but the girl didn't
come out of the building.

169
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:10,810
I didn't know her name, so I couldn't ask
anyone about her.

170
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,120
That night I couldn't sleep.

171
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,709
The next morning, I sat by the window again
and waited.

172
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:26,759
"Then suddenly, she came out of the apartment
building and I went out too.

173
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,279
But when I reached the street, she had disappeared.

174
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:36,260
I didn't see where she had gone, so I walked
around the neighborhood.

175
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,540
At last I saw her in a narrow street.

176
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,269
We smiled at each other.

177
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:47,209
She recognized me, I'm sure of that.

178
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:54,000
From that time, I often went out when the
girl went out.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,870
She always wore the straw hat with the brightly-colored
flowers and ribbons on its brim.

180
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,230
I didn't follow her.

181
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,940
I simply walked around the neighborhood, and
hoped to see her again.

182
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,879
"At last, I went to the landlady of the apartment.

183
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,480
'Who is the girl with the pretty face and
the straw hat?'

184
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,889
I asked her.

185
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,060
'She's my niece, sir,' the landlady replied.

186
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,730
'She's a servant in this house.

187
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,629
She lives here because her parents are dead.

188
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:35,500
She works for me-she cooks and cleans the
building.

189
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,220
I also send her to buy our food.

190
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,250
She lives at the top of the house.

191
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,129
Her room is next to yours, but at the top
of the other staircase.'

192
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:52,000
"Oh, my friend!

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,200
I wish that I'd never heard that piece of
information," Dampier said to me.

194
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,060
"The girl's room was next to mine.

195
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,699
She was on the other side of the thin wall.

196
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,699
At night,

197
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,519
I put my hand on the wall and I thought of
her.

198
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,100
Was her bed by the wall?

199
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,230
Was she sleeping only a few inches from my
hand?

200
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,279
"I couldn't study because of the girl," said
Dampier.

201
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,410
"My mind wasn't clear.

202
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,389
I only thought about the girl.

203
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,520
I couldn't study my books about the occult.

204
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,079
"I'd never wanted to marry," Dampier went
on.

205
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,220
"I'd never wanted a wife and children.

206
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
I was only interested in learning.

207
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,519
And I could never marry a poor, uneducated
servant girl.

208
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,130
My father would never have given his permission.

209
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,370
All my money came from my father.

210
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,449
If he had stopped giving me money...

211
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:06,629
well..."

212
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,170
"What happened next?"

213
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,680
I asked.

214
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,589
My friend looked at me sadly.

215
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:22,010
"I stopped waiting for her and I stopped watching
her.

216
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,060
I only studied.

217
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,529
I spent all my time reading my books.

218
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,660
But one hot night I couldn't sleep.

219
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,389
Thoughts were racing around and around in
my mind.

220
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,269
I thought again and again about the beautiful
girl.

221
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:44,220
I wanted to be with her.

222
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,079
She was only on the other side of the wall!

223
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,120
I tapped on the wall.

224
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,300
I tapped very gently three times.

225
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,880
TAP.

226
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,459
TAP.

227
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,040
TAP.

228
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,290
I tapped again.

229
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,990
TAP.

230
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,699
TAP.

231
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,400
TAP.

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,360
Then I felt foolish.

233
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,510
I was behaving like a boy who is in love for
the first time.

234
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,790
I got out of my bed and began to study my
books.

235
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,980
"I was reading a strange book," Dampier said.

236
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,800
"It was a book of occult philosophy by Necromantius.

237
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,540
You would call it a book of magic and superstition.

238
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,280
In his book, Necromantius describes how to
be a fortune-teller.

239
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,930
Necromantius also wrote about strange and
terrible things that happen three times.

240
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:55,850
When these things happened three times, death
would come.

241
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,430
Necromantius called this a 'fatal triad'.

242
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,950
I believe that a fatal triad has happened
to me."

243
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,000
"Why?"

244
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,710
I asked.

245
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,960
"What happened?"

246
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:21,470
"While I was alone, reading that strange book
by Necromantius," said Dampier, "I heard a

247
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,590
sound.

248
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,970
It was a soft tapping sound.

249
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,370
It came from beyond the wall.

250
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,970
It was the answer to my own signal!

251
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,330
TAP.

252
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,690
TAP.

253
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,060
TAP.

254
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,820
I knew that the pretty servant girl was sending
a message to me.

255
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,040
She wanted me to come to her.

256
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,820
I ran to the wall and tapped my signal again.

257
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,600
TAP.

258
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,380
TAP.

259
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,160
TAP.

260
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,460
But after that, there was silence.

261
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,240
She didn't reply to any of my other signals.

262
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,060
I listened for many hours, but I heard nothing
more.

263
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:16,540
"For many days after this, I looked for the
girl," Dampier said.

264
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,290
"But I never saw her again.

265
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,300
I tried to forget her.

266
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,660
Then one evening, I went to bed early because
I was very tired.

267
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,530
In the middle of the night, I awoke suddenly.

268
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,850
I had heard a soft sound.

269
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,710
I opened my eyes and sat up.

270
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,710
I heard a soft tapping on the wall beside
the bed.

271
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,800
In a few moments, it was repeated.

272
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
TAP.

273
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
TAP.

274
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
TAP.

275
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:58,270
I was going to reply to the signal, then I
stopped.

276
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,130
The girl hadn't replied to my last messages.

277
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,370
I would not reply to her now!"

278
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,180
Dampier drank a little wine and then continued.

279
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,520
"I lay in the bed listening," he said.

280
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,880
"But I didn't reply.

281
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,150
At last, I must have slept.

282
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,040
When I awoke, it was late and I felt tired.

283
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,840
I needed some fresh air, so I went out of
my apartment.

284
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,990
The landlady was outside my door.

285
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,460
'Oh, Mr Dampier,' she said.

286
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,690
'Have you heard the terrible news?'

287
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,700
"My heart began to beat quickly.

288
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,520
My voice shook when I answered.

289
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,140
'W-what news?'

290
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,940
I asked her.

291
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,710
'My poor niece was sick for a week,' the landlady
replied.

292
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,120
'Didn't you know?

293
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,040
I've seen you watching her.

294
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,540
Didn't you know that she was ill?'

295
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,730
"I was shocked," said Dampier.

296
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,400
"I didn't know what to say.

297
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,870
Yes.

298
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,770
I had looked at the girl, but I'd never spoken
to her.

299
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,970
My mind was always full of thoughts of my
books and thoughts of her.

300
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,130
How much time had passed since I had seen
the girl?

301
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,500
A few days?

302
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,580
A week?

303
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,190
I couldn't remember.

304
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,530
"'And how is your niece now?'

305
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,290
I asked the landlady.

306
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,320
'I'm sorry, sir,' the landlady replied.

307
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,090
'She was very ill last night and I took care
of her.

308
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,430
The poor girl made only one request.

309
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,820
She wanted her bed to be moved.

310
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:15,350
She wanted her bed to be beside the wall-the
wall next to your room.

311
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,100
So we moved her bed.

312
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,190
This made her feel happier, poor thing.

313
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,080
Then she touched the wall and smiled.

314
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,850
A few hours later, she died.'"

315
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,910
The expression on Dampier's face was terrible.

316
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,390
There were tears in his eyes as he continued
his story.

317
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:50,220
"When I heard this news, I nearly died too,"
said my friend.

318
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,280
"I didn't know what to say.

319
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,320
What had I done?

320
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,380
I had sent my thoughts to the girl and she
had answered.

321
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,260
I had not called out in words.

322
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:14,360
I had used occult philosophy-magic-to send
her a message."

323
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,050
Dampier was silent for a few minutes.

324
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,040
Then he went on.

325
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,590
"A few days later, I heard of my father's
death," said Dampier sadly.

326
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:34,740
"I left the apartment on Rincon Hill and came
to his house-this house.

327
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,620
It's been my home since then.

328
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:45,510
I've been waiting here, in this tower, for
ten years.

329
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,380
I've been waiting for a visitor.

330
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:55,770
I wasn't expecting to see you, but your visit
wasn't a surprise.

331
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:02,420
Necromantius tells us how signs are repeated
three times.

332
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,620
You've heard my story.

333
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:13,650
You must decide if my story has happened because
of a fatal triad.

334
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,760
I heard the tapping twice before.

335
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,880
The first time, I tried to find the person
who made the noise.

336
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,610
The second time, many signals were sent to
me but I didn't reply.

337
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,030
Now you've heard the tapping too.

338
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,610
That was the third time.

339
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:43,910
The fatal triad is complete."

340
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,700
I stood up and shook Dampier's hand.

341
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,370
My friend knew that I understood his sadness
and pain.

342
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:58,230
He pressed my hand with his fingers and smiled.

343
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,850
I said goodnight.

344
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,530
There was nothing more to say.

345
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:10,800
The next morning, a servant came from Dampier's
