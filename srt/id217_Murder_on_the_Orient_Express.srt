CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,540
The Journey Begins

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,660
The wonderful views of snow-topped mountains  

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,760
passed unnoticed as the train sped 
away from Syria towards Istanbul.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,920
As the Belgian detective M. Hercule Poirot 
drank his coffee, he watched the only other  

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,760
person in the restaurant carriage - a tall, 
thin young lady, perhaps twenty-eight years old.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,300
From the way that she ate her breakfast,  

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,620
she seemed to be an experienced 
and confident traveller.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,640
He admired her pale face, tidy 
dark hair and cool grey eyes.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
A good-looking woman, he thought,  

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,340
but perhaps a little too cold and 
efficient to be described as pretty.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,220
Soon a tall, thin man entered 
the restaurant carriage.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,540
He was between forty and fifty, with 
greying hair and skin darkened by the sun.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,940
He spoke to the woman.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,400
His accent was English.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,340
'Morning, Miss Debenham.'

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,780
'Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot,' she replied.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,660
'Do you mind if I sit with you?'

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,640
'Of course not.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,020
Please, sit.'

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,600
She smiled politely.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,560
He sat down and ordered his breakfast.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,560
He looked quickly towards 
M. Poirot - at his enormous,  

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,840
curled moustache and strange, 
egg-shaped head - then looked away.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,600
'Just a silly looking foreigner,' 
he thought to himself.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,420
The British pair exchanged a few 
polite words over their breakfast,  

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,900
and at lunchtime they sat together again.

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,880
The man spoke of his life in the army in India,  

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,640
and occasionally asked the girl questions 
about Baghdad, where she had been a governess.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,760
When they discovered that they had some 
friends in common, they became more friendly.

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,980
'Are you stopping in Istanbul?' the man asked.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,560
'No, I'm going straight through.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,240
I saw all the sights two years 
ago, on my way to Baghdad.'

34
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,740
'Well, I must say I'm very glad about that.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm going straight through too.'

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,900
His face went a little red.

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,820
'That will be nice,' said 
Miss Debenham without emotion.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,920
The train stopped late that evening at Konya.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,600
The two English travellers went outside 
for some fresh air and exercise.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,760
After a few minutes, Poirot decided to get some 
air too, and started to walk along the platform.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,400
It was bitterly cold.

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Out of the darkness, he heard two voices.

43
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,840
Arbuthnot was speaking.

44
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,840
'Mary -'

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,340
A girl interrupted him.

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,740
'Not now.

47
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,340
Not now.

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
When it's all over.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,500
When it's behind us - then -

50
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,640
M. Poirot silently changed direction.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,140
'Strange,' he said to himself.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,080
It was the voice of Miss Debenham, but 
a very different one from the cool,  

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,600
efficient voice that he had heard on the train.

54
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,420
The next afternoon, the 
train stopped unexpectedly.

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,140
Poirot asked the conductor if there was a problem.

56
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,500
Miss Debenham was just behind him.

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,180
'What's the matter?' she asked Poirot in French.

58
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,280
'Why are we stopping?'

59
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,180
'Something caught fire under the 
restaurant carriage,' he explained,  

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
'but they are repairing the damage.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,640
It is nothing serious.'

62
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,460
She looked impatient.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,240
'But the time! This will delay us.'

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,940
'It is possible - yes,' agreed Poirot.

65
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,880
'But we can't afford delay! If we 
are delayed by more than an hour,  

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,880
we will miss our connection 
with the Orient Express.'

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,360
Her hands were shaking.

68
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,120
She was clearly very upset.

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Luckily, her worries were soon forgotten.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,060
Ten minutes later the train was again on its way,  

71
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,380
and the rest of the journey to 
Istanbul went very smoothly.

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,860
M. Poirot went straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.

73
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,180
He was looking forward to a few days visiting the  

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,780
sights in Istanbul before he 
continued his journey home.

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,640
At the hotel, he asked if he had any letters.

76
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,900
There were three, and an urgent message too.

77
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,360
This was a surprise.

78
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,880
'Unexpected change in Kassner case.

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Please return immediately,' he read.

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,880
'How annoying!' he said to himself.

81
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,100
He looked at the clock.

82
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,880
'I must leave Istanbul tonight,' 
he told the man at the hotel desk.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,460
'Can you get me a first-class 
compartment to London?'

84
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,760
'Of course, Monsieur.

85
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,040
The train is almost empty in the winter.

86
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,780
It leaves at nine o'clock.'

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,980
'Thank you,' said M. Poirot.

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,040
He had just enough time for some dinner.

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,300
As he was ordering his food in the hotel 
restaurant, he felt a hand on his shoulder.

90
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:17,520
'M. Poirot! What an unexpected 
pleasure!' said a voice behind him.

91
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,660
The speaker was a short, fat man in his fifties.

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,920
'M. Bouc!' cried Poirot.

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:35,580
M. Bouc was Belgian, and had a high position in 
the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.

94
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,280
The two men had been friends for many years,  

95
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,860
since the days when Poirot was a young 
detective in the Belgian police force.

96
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,340
'You are very far from home, 
my friend,' said M. Bouc.

97
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,260
'Yes.

98
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,900
A little business in Syria.

99
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,580
But I am heading home tonight - on the 
Orient Express, if there is a compartment.'

100
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
'Excellent! I will be on the same train.

101
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,580
Later, you can tell me all your news.

102
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,020
You are a famous detective now, I hear.'

103
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,360
With a warm smile, M. Bouc left the restaurant.

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,300
M. Poirot returned to the job of 
keeping his moustache out of the soup.

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,400
Soon, though, his attention was caught by two  

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,700
men who were sitting together 
at a table not far from his.

107
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,700
The younger was a friendly-looking 
man of thirty, clearly an American.

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,480
The other was in his sixties and seemed 
at first to be a kind old gentleman.

109
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,940
But when his small, shadowy eyes met Poirot's, 
the detective's opinion of him changed completely.

110
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,700
Just for a second Poirot sensed 
that the man was dangerous.

111
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,640
It seemed that there was a wild 
animal hidden inside the man's body,  

112
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,660
looking out at the world with those evil eyes.

113
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,200
M. Poirot soon joined his friend 
M. Bouc near the hotel desk.

114
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,700
Their conversation was interrupted by the hotel  

115
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,180
worker who was organising 
M. Poirot's train ticket.

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,320
'It is very strange, Monsieur.

117
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,180
All the first-class compartments are 
booked - and the second-class too.'

118
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,020
'What?' asked M. Bouc.

119
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,740
'At this time of year? Impossible!'

120
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,300
'But it is true, sir,' the man replied.

121
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,920
'I am sorry.'

122
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,060
'Well, well,' M. Bouc said 
to Poirot, 'do not worry.

123
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,480
We will arrange something with the conductor.'

124
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,840
He looked up at the clock.

125
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,280
'Come,' he said, 'it is time to go.'

126
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,700
At the station, M. Bouc took 
the conductor to one side.

127
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,100
'We must find a compartment 
for this gentleman here.

128
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,740
He is a friend of mine.'

129
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,880
'But we are completely full, Monsieur.

130
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,920
It is most unusual.'

131
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,260
'Well,' said M. Bouc, 'tomorrow there will 
be more compartments, when we reach Belgrade.

132
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,260
The problem is for tonight.'

133
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,500
He paused for a moment.

134
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,040
'Everyone has arrived?'

135
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,160
The conductor looked at his list.

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
'Number 7 - a second-class compartment.

137
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:03,600
The gentleman - a Mr Harris - has not yet 
come, and it is four minutes to nine.'

138
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,800
'Then put M. Poirot's luggage 
in number 7,' said M. Bouc.

139
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,300
'If this Mr Harris arrives, we 
will tell him that he is too late.'

140
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,860
With words of thanks to M. Bouc, Poirot 
followed his luggage to compartment 7.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,600
Inside it was the tall young 
American from the hotel.

142
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,740
He was not pleased when Poirot entered.

143
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,580
'Excuse me,' he said in French.

144
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,920
'I think you've made a mistake.'

145
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,300
'There are no other beds on the train, 
M. MacQueen,' the conductor apologised.

146
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,600
'The gentleman has to come in here.'

147
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,840
Poirot noticed that the conductor seemed 
almost as annoyed as the American.

148
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,700
Perhaps he had been offered money 
to keep the other bed empty.

149
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,760
When the conductor had left, 
MacQueen's annoyance seemed forgotten.

150
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,400
'The train's surprisingly 
full,' he said with a smile.

151
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,420
Just then, the train started moving.

152
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,560
Their three-day journey across Europe had begun.

153
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,340
After a good night's sleep, Poirot spent 
the morning alone in his compartment,  

154
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,360
looking at his notes on the case 
that had called him to London.

155
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,080
He had a late lunch with M. Bouc.

156
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,200
As they relaxed at the end of the meal, 
they looked around the restaurant carriage.

157
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,400
'If I were a writer, I would 
use this scene,' said M. Bouc.

158
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,980
'All around us are people of all classes, 
of all nationalities, of all ages.

159
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,580
For three days these people 
sleep and eat under one roof.

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,400
They cannot escape each other.

161
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,400
But at the end of the three days they go their 
separate ways and never see each other again.'

162
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,040
There were thirteen people 
in the restaurant carriage,  

163
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,840
and M. Bouc was right: they 
were a very mixed group.

164
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,280
A big, hairy Italian was sitting with a 
thin, pale Englishman, probably a servant,  

165
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,460
and an American in a brightly-coloured suit.

166
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,160
The American and Italian exchanged business advice 
while the Englishman stared out of the window.

167
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
He was clearly not enjoying the conversation.

168
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,100
At the next table sat an ugly lady 
whose clothes and jewellery, though  

169
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,040
they did nothing to help her appearance, were 
clearly from the most expensive shops in Paris.

170
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,120
'That is Princess Dragomiroff,' said M. Bouc.

171
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:23,520
'She is Russian, but her husband got his money out 
of the country before the Communists took control.

172
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,200
So ugly, but what a character!'

173
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,740
At another table, Mary Debenham was sitting with a 
kind looking middle-aged woman with fair hair and  

174
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,480
a sheep-like face; with them was an older woman, 
an American who never seemed to stop talking.

175
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,040
Colonel Arbuthnot was at the next table, alone.

176
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,840
Against the wall sat a middle-aged woman 
dressed in black - a servant, Poirot guessed.

177
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,900
Then there was a good-looking man of 
about thirty with a beautiful young woman.

178
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Perfectly dressed in the latest fashion, 
she had pale skin and large brown eyes.

179
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,060
Poirot could not take his eyes off her.

180
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,240
'A Hungarian diplomat and his wife, I believe,' 
said M. Bouc, seeing his friend's interest.

181
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,780
'A very attractive couple.'

182
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,060
Then there was MacQueen and his employer, the 
man with the kind face and the small, cruel eyes.

183
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,720
M. Bouc returned to his compartment 
while M. Poirot finished his coffee.

184
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,360
'My daughter said I would have no 
trouble with these food tickets,'  

185
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,880
he heard the American woman say to 
Miss Debenham as she paid the waiter.

186
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,760
'But then there's money for the 
waiter, and that bottle of water.

187
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
Nasty water too.

188
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,920
They haven't got any Evian, 
which seems very odd to me.'

189
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,480
She looked crossly at the coins in front of her.

190
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,740
'And look at this rubbish 
that the waiter's given me.

191
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,020
Dinars or something.

192
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,560
My daughter said -'

193
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,480
At this point, Mary Debenham made 
a polite excuse and left the table.

194
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,320
Colonel Arbuthnot got up and followed her.

195
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:38,880
Very soon the restaurant carriage was empty 
except for Poirot and MacQueen's employer.

196
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,300
To the detective's surprise, the 
man came and sat down at his table.

197
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,360
'Good afternoon,' he said in a quiet, deep voice.

198
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,180
'My name is Ratchett.

199
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,320
I think that I have the pleasure 
of speaking to Mr Hercule Poirot.

200
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,720
Is that right?'

201
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,620
'Your information is correct, 
Monsieur,' said the detective.

202
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,780
'I want you to do a job for me,' said Ratchett.

203
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,660
Poirot looked surprised.

204
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,920
'I take very few cases, I'm afraid.'

205
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,020
'Of course.

206
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,920
But this, Mr Poirot, means money.

207
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,020
Big money.'

208
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,860
Poirot was silent for a moment.

209
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:39,960
Then he said, 'What do you wish me 
to do for you, M. - er - Ratchett?'

210
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,460
'Mr Poirot, I am a rich man - a very rich man.

211
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,240
Men in my position have enemies.

212
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,140
Someone has threatened to kill me.

213
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,800
I can look after myself quite well.'

214
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,060
He quickly showed Poirot the gun in his pocket.

215
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,960
'But I'd like to be especially careful.

216
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,440
Remember, we are talking big money, Mr Poirot.'

217
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,280
Poirot thought for some minutes.

218
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,600
Finally he said, 'I am sorry, 
Monsieur, but I cannot help you.'

219
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,660
The other man smiled.

220
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,920
'Not even if I give you twenty thousand dollars?'

221
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,500
'No, Monsieur.'

222
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,720
'But why not? Why does this 
case not interest you?'

223
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,840
Poirot stood up.

224
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,200
'Forgive me for being personal, but I do 
not like your face, M. Ratchett,' he said.

225
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,140
The Orient Express arrived at Belgrade 
at a quarter to nine that evening.

226
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,080
M. Bouc was moved into a carriage that 
had just joined the train from Athens,  

227
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,460
and Poirot was given M. Bouc's 
old compartment, number 1.

228
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,960
At 9.15, with heavy snow falling 
outside, the train was on its way again.

229
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,900
The strangers of yesterday were 
already becoming more friendly.

230
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,780
Colonel Arbuthnot was standing at the door 
of his compartment talking to MacQueen.

231
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,920
Two doors from Poirot's new compartment,  

232
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,680
the older American woman, Mrs Hubbard, 
was talking to the sheep-like lady.

233
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:48,420
'Oh, isn't this cold weather terrible! I 
hope your head will be better in the morning.

234
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,480
Have you got some aspirin? 
Are you sure? I've got plenty.

235
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,240
Well, good night, my dear.'

236
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,860
She turned to Poirot as the other woman departed.

237
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
'Poor woman, she's Swedish.

238
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,380
Some kind of teacher.

239
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,500
Very nice, but doesn't talk much English.

240
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,280
She was very interested to 
hear about my daughter.'

241
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,140
Poirot, like everyone else on the train, 
now knew all about Mrs Hubbard's daughter,  

242
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,740
who was teaching at a big 
American college in Turkey.

243
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
They also knew Mrs Hubbard's opinion of Turks,  

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,440
their lazy habits and the 
terrible condition of their roads.

245
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,460
The door next to them opened and 
the thin, pale manservant came out.

246
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,680
Inside, Poirot saw Mr Ratchett sitting up in bed.

247
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,900
Then the door was shut.

248
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,040
Mrs Hubbard moved closer to Poirot.

249
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,040
'You know, I'm frightened of 
that man,' she said quietly.

250
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,040
'Not the servant - the other man.

251
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,280
I can just feel that he's dangerous.

252
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,520
He's next door to me and I don't like it.

253
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,180
It wouldn't surprise me if he was a murderer.'

254
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Colonel Arbuthnot and MacQueen were 
coming towards them down the corridor.

255
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,260
'Come into my compartment,' MacQueen 
was saying, 'and we can talk some more.

256
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,460
So you think that in India the British should -'

257
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,520
The voice suddenly went quiet as the 
two men entered MacQueen's compartment.

258
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,800
'I'm going to bed,' Mrs Hubbard said to Poirot.

259
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,060
'Good night.'

260
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,960
Poirot went into his own compartment, 
which was the next one beyond Ratchett's.

261
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,600
He read in bed for about hall an 
hour and then turned out the light.

262
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,920
He was woken a few hours later by a cry.

263
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,200
It sounded like a cry of pain, 
from somewhere not far away.

264
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,060
This was immediately followed 
by the ringing of a bell.

265
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,440
Poirot sat up and switched on the light.

266
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,340
He noticed that the train was not moving.

267
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,660
Remembering that Ratchett was 
in the next-door compartment,  

268
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,020
he got out of bed and opened the door.

269
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,400
The conductor was hurrying along the corridor.

270
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,200
He knocked on

271
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,920
Ratchett's door.

272
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,840
No answer.

273
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,360
He knocked a second time,  

274
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,280
just as another bell rang further down 
the corridor and a light was turned on.

275
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,769
From Ratchett's compartment, a 
voice called out, 'Ce n'est rien.

276
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:49,500
Je me suis trompe.'

277
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,120
'Very good, Monsieur,' said the conductor.

278
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,460
He hurried off again, towards the 
door where the light was showing.

279
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,340
Poirot returned to bed, checked his 
watch and switched off the light.

280
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,580
It was twenty-three minutes to one.

281
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,860
He could not sleep.

282
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,660
The noises on board the 
train seemed unusually loud.

283
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,140
He could hear Ratchett moving around next 
door, and footsteps in the corridor outside.

284
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,800
His throat felt dry.

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,880
He had forgotten to ask for 
his usual bottle of water.

286
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,700
He looked at his watch again.

287
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,800
A quarter past one.

288
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,640
He was thinking of ringing for the conductor and  

289
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,880
asking him for water when 
he heard another bell ring.

290
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,200
Ting...

291
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,380
ting...

292
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,800
ting...

293
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,060
Poirot waited: The conductor could not 
come to two compartments at the same time.

294
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,540
The bell sounded again and again.

295
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,780
Someone was clearly getting impatient.

296
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,900
Finally the conductor came.

297
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,080
Poirot heard him apologise.

298
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,580
Then there was a woman's voice - Mrs Hubbard's.

299
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,460
She spoke for some time, with the conductor 
adding a few words here and there.

300
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,140
Then the conductor said goodnight 
and the door was closed.

301
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,340
Poirot took his chance and rang his own bell.

302
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,540
The conductor, when he came, looked upset.

303
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,460
'It is Mrs Hubbard,' he explained.

304
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,180
'She says that there is a man in her room.

305
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,240
Imagine it - in a room of that size!  

306
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,440
Where could he hide? I told her that it 
was impossible, but she didn't listen.

307
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,707
We have enough to worry about 
already, with this snow -'

308
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,180
'Snow?'

309
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,440
'Yes, Monsieur.

310
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,660
There is too much snow on the line.

311
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,060
The train has stopped.

312
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,400
We might have to wait here for days.'

313
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,320
He brought Poirot the water, then said goodnight.

314
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,120
Poirot drank a glass of water 
and began to fall asleep.

315
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,720
He was soon wide awake again, though.

316
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,980
There had been a loud noise 
from the next-door compartment.

317
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,180
Had something heavy fallen against the door?

318
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,780
He jumped out of bed and looked out.

319
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,140
Nothing, except a woman in a red dressing 
gown some distance down the corridor.

320
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,540
At the other end of the corridor, the 
conductor was doing some paperwork.

321
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,700
Everything was quiet.

322
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,080
'I should stop worrying,' he said 
to himself, and went back to bed.

323
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,620
This time he slept until morning.

324
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,320
CHAPTER TWO

325
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,800
A Cruel and Dangerous Man

326
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,820
When Poirot woke, the train was still not moving.

327
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
There was deep snow all around them.

328
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,400
In the restaurant carriage, everyone 
was complaining about the delay.

329
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,980
'How long will we be here?' Mary Debenham asked.

330
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,140
'Doesn't anybody know?'

331
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,060
Her voice sounded impatient, but she was not  

332
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,960
upset in the way that she had been at 
the delay before reaching Istanbul.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,860
Mrs Hubbard replied, 'Nobody knows anything on 
this train, and nobody's trying to do anything.

334
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:53,580
If this was in America, people would at least 
try to do something! My daughter says -'  

335
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,560
The morning continued in this way.

336
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,540
Poirot learnt a lot more about 
Mrs Hubbard's daughter and about  

337
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,660
the habits of Mr Hubbard, who had recently died.

338
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,640
Turning round, Poirot noticed a conductor at his  

339
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,860
elbow - not the conductor from the 
night before, but a big, fair man.

340
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,940
'Excuse me, Monsieur,' he said.

341
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,800
'M. Bouc would be grateful it you 
could come to him for a few minutes.'

342
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,620
Poirot made his excuses to 
the ladies and followed the  

343
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,080
conductor to a compartment in the next carriage.

344
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:38,940
M. Bouc was sitting there with a small, dark man, 
and a man in a blue uniform - the train manager.

345
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,320
The conductor from the night 
before was standing by the window.

346
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,820
'My good friend,' cried M. 
Bouc, 'we need your help!'

347
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,420
M. Bouc was clearly upset.

348
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Poirot realised at once 
that the matter was serious.

349
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,360
'What has happened?' he asked.

350
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,940
'Well, first this terrible snow - this delay.

351
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,820
And now -'

352
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,600
He stopped.

353
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,480
'And now what?'

354
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,300
'And now a passenger lies murdered in his bed.'

355
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,520
'Which passenger?' asked M. Poirot.

356
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,860
'An American.

357
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,520
A mad called - called -' M. 
Bouc looked at his notes.

358
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,660
'Ratchett.

359
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,160
It is a disaster!

360
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,440
A murder is bad enough.

361
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,080
But the train cannot move.

362
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,260
We may be here for days.

363
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:56,040
We have no police on board, and Dr Constantine 
thinks that the murderer is still among us.'

364
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,540
The small, dark man now spoke.

365
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,180
'The window of M. Ratchett's 
compartment was found wide open,  

366
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,420
but there were no footprints in the snow.

367
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,360
No one left the train that way.'

368
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,600
'At what time was the 
murder?' asked the detective.

369
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,320
'It is difficult to give an exact time,'  

370
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,920
replied the doctor, 'but it was some 
time between midnight and 2 a.m.'

371
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,620
'And the crime was discovered - when?'

372
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,420
M. Bouc turned to Michel, the conductor by 
the window, who looked pale and frightened.

373
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,500
'The waiter from the restaurant carriage 
wanted to know if Monsieur wanted lunch,'  

374
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,180
said the conductor.

375
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
'There was no answer.

376
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,760
I opened the door with my 
key, but there was a bolt too.

377
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,820
I called the train manager.

378
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,180
We cut through the bolt and went in.

379
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,680
He was - it was terrible.

380
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,380
Terrible!' He hid his face in his hands.

381
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,020
'The door was locked and bolted on 
the inside,' said Poirot thoughtfully.

382
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,440
'Perhaps he killed himself?'

383
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,380
'Does a man kill himself with twelve knife 
wounds in the chest?' asked the doctor.

384
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,440
'It was a woman,' said the train 
manager, speaking for the first time.

385
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,620
'Only a woman would kill like that.'

386
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,660
'Then it was a very strong 
woman,' said the doctor.

387
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,200
'The knife went through bone in some places.'

388
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,540
'So, my friend, you see our problem.'

389
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,140
M. Bouc looked at the detective.

390
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,840
'Can you help us?'

391
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,980
'What exactly do you want 
me to do?' M. Poirot asked.

392
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:23,700
'Take command of the case! When the police arrive, 
there will be problems, delays, unpleasantness.

393
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:30,660
It would be so much better if the case 
was already solved when they arrived.

394
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,860
And you are the perfect man for the job.

395
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,480
Examine the body and interview the passengers.

396
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:47,880
You will not be able to check their stories, 
but you once said, "To solve a case,  

397
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:56,820
a man just has to he back in his chair 
and think." Do that - and you will know!'

398
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,120
'I accept the case willingly,' 
smiled the detective.

399
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,300
'It will help to pass the time.'

400
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,740
'Wonderful!' said M. Bouc.

401
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,700
'We will help you in any way that we can.'

402
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,780
'First, I would like a plan of the 
carriage where the murder took place,  

403
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,280
with a note of the names of 
the people in each compartment.

404
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,960
I will also need their passports and tickets.'

405
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,380
'Michel will get you those.'

406
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,680
The conductor left the compartment.

407
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,000
'Who are the other passengers 
on the train?' asked M. Poirot.

408
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,600
'In this carriage, Dr Constantine 
and I are the only travellers.

409
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,040
Behind this are the third-class carriages, 
but they were locked after dinner last night.

410
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,840
In front, there is only the restaurant carriage.'

411
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:17,640
'So it seems likely that the murderer is now 
in the American's carriage,' said Poirot.

412
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,060
'Yes,' agreed Dr Constantine.

413
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,500
'At half past midnight we 
were stopped by the snow.

414
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,940
No one has left the train 
since then - or at least,  

415
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,180
there are certainly no footprints in the snow.'

416
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,700
'First I would like to speak with 
young M. MacQueen,' said Poirot.

417
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,200
'He may be able to give us 
some useful information.'

418
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,180
The train manager fetched MacQueen.

419
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,220
'What's the problem?' asked the American 
nervously as he sat down opposite Poirot.

420
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,740
'Has anything happened?'

421
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,840
'Yes, Monsieur,' answered the detective.

422
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,680
.'Prepare yourself for a shock.

423
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,320
Your employer, M. Ratchett, has been murdered.'

424
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:24,600
MacQueen's eyes seemed brighter, but except 
for this he showed no signs of shock.

425
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,940
'So they got him after all,' he said.

426
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,960
'What do you mean, M. MacQueen?'

427
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,840
MacQueen paused.

428
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,440
'And you are -?'

429
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,980
'I am a detective working for the 
Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.

430
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,780
My name is M. Hercule Poirot.

431
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,360
Now, please, tell me what you 
mean, They got him after all.'

432
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,160
'Well, he has been getting letters.

433
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,320
Threatening letters.'

434
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,200
'Did you see them?'

435
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,060
'Yes.

436
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,600
I am - was - his secretary.

437
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,660
It was my job to answer his letters.

438
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,240
The first came last week.

439
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,340
Would you like to see it?'

440
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,640
'Yes, that would he most 
helpful,' replied the detective.

441
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,060
MacQueen left, and soon returned with 
a rather dirty piece of notepaper.

442
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,620
Poirot read the carefully printed handwriting:

443
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:45,360
You thought you could cheat us, 
didn't you? Well, you were wrong.

444
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,440
We're going to get you, Ratchett!

445
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,220
'And the other letters were 
similar?' asked the detective.

446
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,280
'Yes, very similar.

447
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,100
Ratchett pretended to laugh about them, 
but I could see that they worried him.'

448
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,960
'How long have you been working for M. Ratchett?'

449
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,720
'A year.

450
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,880
He travelled around a lot, but he 
spoke no languages except English.

451
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,840
I was more his translator than his secretary.'

452
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,200
'Now, tell me as much as you 
can about your employer.'

453
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,440
'That's not so easy.'

454
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,020
He looked confused.

455
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,280
'He was an American citizen?'

456
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,140
'Yes.'

457
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,040
'What part of America was he from?'

458
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,500
'I don't know.

459
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,860
I know almost nothing about him.

460
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,240
Mr Ratchett never spoke of himself, or 
his family, or his life in America.'

461
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,320
'Why was that, do you think?'

462
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,760
'Well, I think he was hiding 
something - something in his past.

463
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,020
I'm not even sure that 
Ratchett was his real name.'

464
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,800
'One last question.

465
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,240
Did you have a good relationship 
with your employer?'

466
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,480
'Well, yes, I did.

467
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,320
I didn't like him very much as a person, but 
I had no problems with him as an employer.'

468
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,920
'You did not like him.

469
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,020
Why was that?'

470
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,140
'I can't exactly say.'

471
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:49,380
He paused, then continued, 'He was, 
I am sure, a cruel and dangerous man.

472
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,500
I have no reason for this opinion, M. 
Poirot, but I feel it very strongly.'

473
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,600
'Thank you for your honesty, Mr MacQueen.'

474
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:10,320
M. Poirot and Dr Constantine went together 
to the compartment of the murdered man.

475
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
It was freezing cold inside.

476
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,160
The window was pushed down as far as it could go.

477
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,620
'I did not like to close it,' said the doctor.

478
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,460
'Nothing has been touched in here, and I was 
careful not to move the body when I examined it.'

479
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,940
'Good,' said Poirot.

480
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,320
He checked the window for 
fingerprints, but there were none.

481
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,100
'Criminals these days are always 
careful about fingerprints.

482
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
And you were right, Doctor.

483
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,220
There are no footprints in the snow.

484
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,700
No one left the carriage through 
this window - although perhaps  

485
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,600
the murderer wanted us to think that he did.'

486
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,720
Poirot closed the window and 
turned his attention to the body.

487
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,560
Ratchett was lying on his back in the bed.

488
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,580
The detective bent down to look at the wounds.

489
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,360
'How many wounds are there exactly?' he asked.

490
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,240
'Twelve, I think.

491
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,220
Some are very slight, but at least 
three are serious enough to cause death.

492
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,340
And there is something strange.

493
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,640
These two wounds - here and here -' He pointed.

494
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,620
'They are deep, but they have 
not bled in the normal way.'

495
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,700
'Which means -?

496
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,560
'That the man was already dead 
- dead for some time - when

497
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,580
these wounds were made.

498
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,300
But that seems impossible.'

499
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,140
'Unlikely, certainly - unless 
our murderer was worried that he  

500
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,540
hadn't done the job right the first 
time and came back to make sure.'

501
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,800
He paused, then asked 
suddenly, 'Were the lights on?'

502
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,840
'No,' replied the doctor.

503
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,520
Poirot thought for a moment.

504
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,960
'So we have two murderers.

505
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,140
The first did his job, then 
turned off the light as he left.

506
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,580
Later, the second arrived in the dark,  

507
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:45,660
did not see that his or her work had 
been done and struck at a dead body.

508
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,180
What do you think?'

509
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,600
'Very good!' said the doctor.

510
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,300
'That would also explain why some wounds 
are deep but others are so slight.

511
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,100
We have a strong murderer and a weaker one.'

512
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:12,540
'Yes, but two independent murderers 
on the same night? It is so unlikely!'  

513
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:21,240
Poirot stopped, then continued, 'Could the 
deepest wounds be the work of a woman?'

514
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,460
'Perhaps - but only if she was very strong.'

515
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,280
Poirot put his hand under the 
pillow and pulled out the gun  

516
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,200
that Ratchett had shown him the day before.

517
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:42,960
'Why didn't the American defend himself? 
The bullets are all there, you see.'

518
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,900
They looked round the room.

519
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,100
Ratchett's clothes were 
hanging tidily behind the door.

520
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,260
On a small table was a bottle 
of water, an empty glass,  

521
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,400
some burnt pieces of paper and a used match.

522
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,320
The doctor picked up the 
empty glass and smelled it.

523
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,180
'This is why Ratchett failed to defend himself.

524
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,100
He was drugged.'

525
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,520
Poirot felt in Ratchett's pockets and 
soon brought out a box of matches.

526
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,600
He compared the matches carefully 
with the one on the table.

527
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,660
'The match on the table is a different 
shape from these - shorter and flatter.

528
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,380
Perhaps it was the murderer's.'

529
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,120
The detective continued to look round the room.

530
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,300
Then, with a cry, he bent down and 
picked up a handkerchief from the floor.

531
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,880
It was small and pretty.

532
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,040
'The train manager was right!' he said.

533
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,160
'There is a woman in this case.

534
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:04,980
And she very conveniently leaves us a clue - 
exactly as it happens in the books and films.

535
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,720
And to make things even easier for 
us, there is a letter H on it.'

536
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Poirot made another dive to the floor, and this 
time stood up with a pipe cleaner in his hand.

537
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,340
'Another convenient clue,' he smiled.

538
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,860
'And this time it suggests a man, not a woman.'

539
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,680
The doctor was now looking in the 
front pocket of Ratchett's pyjamas.

540
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,980
'Ah!' he said.

541
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,800
'I didn't notice this earlier.'

542
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,060
He showed Poirot a gold pocket watch.

543
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,360
The case was badly damaged, and the 
hands pointed to a quarter past one.

544
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,860
'You see?' cried Constantine.

545
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,740
'This gives us the hour of the

546
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,100
crime.

547
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:09,360
It fits perfectly with the medical evidence, 
that he died between midnight and 2 a.m.'

548
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,520
'It is possible, yes,' said the 
detective in a troubled voice.

549
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,760
He went back to the little table and 
examined the burnt bits of paper.

550
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,240
'I need a ladies' hat box!' he said softly.

551
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,980
Before Dr Constantine was able to ask why, Poirot 
was in the corridor, calling for the conductor.

552
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,800
The conductor soon came in with a hat box 
borrowed from one of the lady passengers.

553
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,260
'There are so many clues in this room,'  

554
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,240
Poirot explained to the doctor, 
who was looking very confused.

555
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,580
'The watch, the pipe cleaner, the handkerchief.

556
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,800
But how can we be sure that they are not 
false clues, left here to confuse us?

557
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:15,120
I am only sure of two clues - 
the match and the burnt paper.

558
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,400
The murderer didn't want us to 
read the words on that paper.

559
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,520
Let us see.'

560
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,340
From the hat box, Poirot took 
one of the pieces of shaped  

561
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,860
wire netting over which a hat would normally sit.

562
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,260
He flattened it, then carefully 
placed the burnt pieces of paper  

563
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,460
on top and covered them with 
another piece of wire netting.

564
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,320
He lit a match and held the wire over the flame.

565
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:54,720
The doctor watched with interest as, 
slowly, some words appeared - words of fire.

566
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,540
'-member little Daisy Armstrong.'

567
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,440
'Ah!' cried Poirot.

568
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,060
'So Ratchett was not the dead man's real name.

569
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,400
We now know his name, and why he left America.'

570
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,960
'We do?' asked the doctor.

571
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,640
'Yes.

572
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,880
We must go and tell M. Bouc.'

573
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,720
The two men found M. Bouc 
finishing lunch in his compartment.

574
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:41,880
'After lunch, we will empty the restaurant 
carriage and use it for your interviews,'  

575
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,860
M. Bouc said.

576
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,580
'I have ordered some food for you here.'

577
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,380
The doctor and the detective ate quickly.

578
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:59,340
M. Bouc waited until their coffee 
had been served, then asked, 'Well?'

579
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,000
'I know the real name of the 
murdered man,' said Poirot.

580
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,120
'He was Cassetti.

581
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,440
Do you remember the Armstrong case?'

582
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,080
'Yes, I think I do,' answered M. Bouc.

583
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,200
'A terrible business - although 
I cannot remember the details.'

584
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,360
'Colonel Armstrong was an Englishman,  

585
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,780
married to the daughter of America's 
most famous actress, Linda Arden.

586
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,620
They were living in America when their 
three-year-old daughter was kidnapped.

587
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,000
After messages from the kidnappers, 
the parents paid them more than two  

588
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,400
hundred thousand dollars for her return.

589
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,400
But instead, the child's dead body was discovered.

590
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,560
Mrs Armstrong was carrying 
another baby at the time,  

591
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,140
and the shock of her daughter's 
murder made her give birth too soon.

592
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,340
She and the baby both died.

593
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,440
The heartbroken husband then shot himself.'

594
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,580
'Yes, I remember now,' M. Bouc said softly.

595
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,020
'And there was another death too, wasn't there?'

596
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,360
'A French or Swiss girl who 
worked for the Armstrongs.

597
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,860
The police believed that she had helped the 
kidnappers, although she strongly denied this.

598
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,400
She threw herself out of a window.

599
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,220
Later, it was proved that 
she was completely innocent.'

600
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,900
'Terrible!' said the doctor.

601
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,560
'About six months after these 
events, the police caught Cassetti.

602
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,120
He was the leader of a team of gangsters who had  

603
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,960
kidnapped and killed people 
in a similar way before.

604
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,260
There was no doubt that he was 
guilty of the Armstrong kidnap too.

605
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:27,540
But Cassetti was very rich, and he used his 
money to escape punishment for his crimes.

606
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,800
After the court case, he disappeared.

607
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,640
And now we know where he went.

608
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:41,940
He changed his name to Ratchett 
and began travelling abroad.'

609
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,920
'What an animal!' cried M. Bouc.

610
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,740
'He got what he deserved.'

611
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,360
'I agree,' said M. Poirot.

612
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:02,940
'But was the murderer another gangster, 
or someone connected to Daisy Armstrong?'

613
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,400
'Are there any members of 
the Armstrong family living?'

614
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,320
'I don't know,' replied the detective.

615
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,620
'I seem to remember that Mrs 
Armstrong had a younger sister.'

616
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,860
There was a knock at the door.

617
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,220
'The restaurant carriage is ready for you, 
Monsieur,' said the waiter to M. Bouc.

618
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,440
The three men walked down the 
corridor to begin the interviews.

619
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,280
CHAPTER THREE

620
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,060
A Red Dressing Gown and a Metal Button

621
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:54,300
In the restaurant carriage, everything was ready 
- a pile of passports and tickets, a plan of  

622
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:00,480
the carriage with the names of the passengers 
marked on it, and writing paper, a pen and ink.

623
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,680
'Excellent,' said Poirot.

624
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,580
'Our first interview will be with the conductor.

625
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,560
You probably know something 
about his character, M. Bouc.

626
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,800
Should we believe his evidence?'

627
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,120
'Definitely,' replied M. Bouc.

628
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,040
'Pierre Michel has worked for 
the company for fifteen years.

629
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,980
A Frenchman - very honest.'

630
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,880
Michel entered the carriage.

631
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,940
He seemed less upset than he had been 
earlier, but he was still very nervous.

632
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:49,140
'Now, Michel,' said M. Poirot gently, 'we 
have to ask you a few things about last night.

633
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,340
M. Ratchett went to bed - when?'

634
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,860
'Soon after dinner, Monsieur 
- before we left Belgrade.'

635
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,100
'Did you see anyone go into 
his compartment afterwards?'

636
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,900
'His manservant, Monsieur, and his secretary.

637
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,160
No one else.'

638
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,220
'And was that the last time 
you saw or heard from him?'

639
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,800
'No, Monsieur.

640
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,860
He rang his bell at about twenty to one.

641
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,060
I knocked, but he called out, 'Ce n'est rieti.

642
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,560
Je me suis trompe.'

643
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,960
'And where were you at a quarter past one?'

644
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,600
'Most of the time I was at my 
seat at the end of the corridor.

645
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,660
Soon after one - I don't know when exactly - I  

646
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,320
went to the next carriage to talk 
to a colleague about the snow.

647
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:55,500
Then Mrs Hubbard rang, and I 
spoke to her for a few minutes.

648
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,860
Then I brought you some water, Monsieur.'

649
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,840
'And later?'

650
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,740
'At about two o'clock M. MacQueen 
asked me to make his bed.

651
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,780
The English Colonel from 
number 15 was there with him.

652
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,000
When they had gone to bed, I 
sat at my seat until morning.'

653
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,760
'Did you sleep?'

654
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,640
'I don't think so, Monsieur.'

655
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,500
'Did you see any of the 
passengers in the corridor?'

656
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,980
The conductor thought for a moment.

657
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,820
'One of the ladies went to the toilet.'

658
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,040
'Which one?'

659
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,080
'I don't know, but she was 
wearing a red dressing gown.

660
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,680
It had a Chinese-style picture on the back.'

661
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,800
'And after that?'

662
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,020
'You yourself opened the door 
and looked out for a second.'

663
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,860
'Good,' said Poirot.

664
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,200
'I wondered if you would remember that.

665
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:08,400
Now, if the murderer came 
onto the train last night -'

666
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,760
'There were no strangers on 
the train last night, Monsieur.

667
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,980
The door to the next carriage 
was bolted on the inside.

668
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:24,780
I opened the side door when we stopped 
at Vincovci at twenty past twelve,  

669
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,600
but I was standing there all the time.

670
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,940
No one came through it.'

671
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,600
'What about the side door 
beyond the restaurant carriage?'

672
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,220
'That is always bolted on the inside at night.'

673
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,980
'It isn't bolted now.'

674
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,880
The man looked surprised for a moment.

675
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:55,620
'Perhaps one of the passengers opened it 
to look at the snow,' he said finally.

676
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,000
'Monsieur, you do not blame me?'

677
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,780
Poirot smiled at him kindly.

678
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,600
'Of course not, my friend.

679
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,640
Ah!

680
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,580
I have one other thing to ask you.

681
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,400
Another bell rang just after you 
knocked on M. Ratchett's door.

682
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,500
Whose was it?'

683
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,460
'Princess Dragomiroff's, Monsieur.

684
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,200
She wanted her maid.'

685
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,320
'You called the maid?'

686
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,240
'Yes, Monsieur.'

687
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,340
'That is all.

688
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,560
Thank you for your help.'

689
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,460
The conductor left the restaurant carriage and 
Poirot called Mr MacQueen for another interview.

690
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,660
When MacQueen learnt that his employer had 
been the criminal Cassetti, he was very angry.

691
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,680
'How terrible that I helped an 
evil man like that!' he cried.

692
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,740
'You seem to feel very strongly 
about this, M. MacQueen.'

693
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,260
'Yes, I do.

694
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,580
My father was on the legal 
team in the Armstrong case.

695
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,240
He knew that Cassetti was guilty, but things 
went wrong in court and it couldn't be proved.

696
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,440
Well, I'm glad that he's dead - although 
I didn't kill him myself, you understand.'

697
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,860
'Of course, of course.

698
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,620
Now, I must check the movements 
of everyone on the train.

699
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,180
What did you do last night after dinner?'

700
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,220
'Well, I talked to some of the other passengers.

701
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:50,580
At about ten o'clock, I went into 
Mr Ratchett's compartment and he

702
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,440
asked me to write some letters for him.

703
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,660
Then I got into a long conversation 
with Colonel Arbuthnot.'

704
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,280
'Do you know what time you went to bed?'

705
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,820
'About two o'clock, I think.'

706
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,140
'Did you leave the train at any time?'

707
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,680
'Arbuthnot and I got out at - what 
was the name of the place? - Vincovci.

708
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,600
But it was bitterly cold, 
so we soon came back in.'

709
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,160
'By which door did you leave the train?'

710
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,880
'By the one next to the restaurant carriage.'

711
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,500
'Do you remember if it was bolted?'

712
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,500
MacQueen stopped to think.

713
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,500
'Yes, I believe it was.'

714
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,140
'And did you bolt it again when 
you got back on the train?'

715
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:51,660
'I got on last, and no, I 
don't think 1 bolted it.'

716
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,280
'When you were with Colonel Arbuthnot,'  

717
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,640
continued the detective, 'the door of 
your compartment was open, I think.

718
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:10,320
Please tell me who passed along the 
corridor after the train left Vincovci.'

719
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,220
'The conductor - and a woman too, 
going towards the restaurant carriage.'

720
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,440
'Which woman?'

721
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,300
'I don't know.

722
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,140
I just remember seeing a thin red dressing gown.

723
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,420
She was probably going to the toilet.'

724
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,960
'Did you see her return?'

725
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,760
'Well, no, I don't remember seeing her.'

726
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,100
'One more question.

727
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,040
Do you smoke a pipe?'

728
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,360
'No, sir, I don't,' replied MacQueen.

729
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,780
'I think that is all at present.

730
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,640
Thank you for your time.

731
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,680
I would now like to speak to 
M. Ratchett's manservant.'

732
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,900
The American left and the 
thin, pale Englishman arrived.

733
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,960
The detective picked up his passport.

734
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,880
'You are the manservant of M. 
Ratchett - Edward Henry Masterman,  

735
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,600
age thirty-nine, a British citizen?'

736
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,700
'Yes, sir.'

737
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,260
'You have heard that your 
employer has been murdered?'

738
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,480
'Yes, sir.

739
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,800
A terrible crime.'

740
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,900
'Please tell me when you last saw M. Ratchett.'

741
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,860
'It was at about nine o'clock last night, sir.

742
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:40,140
I went to Mr Ratchett as usual, and 
helped him to get ready for bed.'

743
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,340
'What sort of mood was he in?'

744
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,800
'Not a good one, sir.

745
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,420
He had just read a letter and 
I think he was upset about it.

746
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,240
He criticised everything that I did.'

747
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,660
'Was that unusual?'

748
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,580
'No, sir.

749
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,040
He lost his temper easily.'

750
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:08,640
'Did M. Ratchett ever take any 
medicine to help him sleep?'  

751
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,040
Dr Constantine moved forward 
a little to hear his answer.

752
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,860
'Always, sir, when he was travelling.

753
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,560
He said that he could not sleep without it.'

754
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,460
'Did he take it last night?'

755
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,500
'Yes, sir.

756
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,080
I poured it into a glass for him myself.'

757
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:34,020
'Did you like your employer, M. Masterman?'

758
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,460
The manservant's face showed no emotion.

759
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,980
'He paid me well, sir - but I'm 
not very fond of Americans.'

760
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,940
'Have you ever been to America?'

761
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:49,980
'No, sir.'

762
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,800
'And what did you do after 
leaving M. Ratchett last night?'

763
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,760
'I told Mr MacQueen that he was wanted.

764
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,060
Then I went back to my own compartment and read.'

765
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,320
'You were in compartment number 4.'

766
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,800
'Yes, sir, with a big Italian man.'

767
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,700
'Does the Italian speak English?'

768
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,660
'Well, a kind of English, sir.

769
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,720
He's been in America - Chicago, I understand.

770
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,000
We do not talk much.

771
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,320
I prefer to read.'

772
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,460
'What time did you go to sleep?'

773
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,220
'I went to bed at about ten 
thirty, sir, but I didn't sleep.

774
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,840
I had toothache.'

775
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,900
'Did you not sleep at all?'

776
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,120
'Yes, in the end.

777
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,820
But not until about four in the morning.'

778
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,440
'Did you leave your compartment during the night?'

779
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,240
'No, sir.'

780
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,520
'And the Italian?'

781
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,440
'No, sir.

782
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,700
He slept all night.'

783
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,060
'One last question.

784
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,940
Do you smoke a pipe?'

785
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,560
'No, sir.

786
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,360
I only smoke cigarettes.'

787
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,420
'Thank you, Mr Masterman.

788
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,460
I think that is all.'

789
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:19,200
'Excuse me, sir, but the American lady, Mrs 
Hubbard, says she knows all about the murderer.

790
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,900
She is very upset, sir.'

791
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,440
'Then we should see her next, 
I think,' said Poirot, smiling.

792
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,280
Mrs Hubbard entered the restaurant 
carriage talking excitedly.

793
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,460
'Now who's in charge here, because I 
have some very important information.

794
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,860
Very important.'

795
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,960
'Please, Madame, sit,' said Poirot.

796
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,480
'Then tell me everything.'

797
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,560
'Well, I will tell you this.

798
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:02,640
There was a murder on the train last night, 
and the murderer was in my compartment!'

799
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,900
'You are sure of this, Madame?'

800
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:13,320
'Of course I'm sure! I was 
asleep, and suddenly I woke up.

801
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,300
It was dark - and I knew that 
there was a man in my compartment.

802
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,260
I was so frightened that I couldn't scream.

803
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,980
I thought, "I'm going to be killed!"  

804
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:34,440
It was so terrible - these nasty trains, 
and the horrible things that happen on them!  

805
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:42,840
And then I thought, "Well, he won't get my 
jewellery," because I'd hidden it under my pillow.

806
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,540
Very uncomfortable, I can tell you.

807
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,940
But that's not important.

808
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,560
Where was I?'

809
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,300
'You realised that there was 
a man in your compartment.'

810
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:01,020
'Yes, well, I just lay there with 
my eyes closed for some time.

811
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:06,660
Then I felt for the bell with my hand 
and pressed it to call the conductor.

812
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,560
I rang and rang, but nothing happened.

813
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,800
"Maybe they've already murdered 
everyone else on the train," I thought.

814
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,700
Then finally the conductor came in.

815
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,420
I switched on the lights, but

816
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,820
there wasn't anyone there at all.'

817
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,720
Judging by Mrs Hubbard's voice,  

818
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,580
she thought that her last words were 
the most exciting part of her story.

819
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,200
'And what happened next, Madame?'

820
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,800
'Well, I told the conductor what had 
happened, and he didn't seem to believe me.

821
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:53,220
Clearly the man had got away, but the 
conductor only wanted to calm me down!

822
01:03:54,180 --> 01:04:00,600
Well, at the time I was worried that the man 
was the one from the next-door compartment.

823
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:09,660
I asked the conductor to look at the door between 
the compartments, and of course it wasn't bolted.

824
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,900
Well, I bolted it immediately, and 
put a suitcase against it too.'

825
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,920
'And do you think the man in 
your compartment went into Mr  

826
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,880
Ratchett's compartment, or out into the corridor?'

827
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,460
'How could I know that? My eyes were tight shut.

828
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:37,080
Oh, if my daughter knew how frightened I was!'

829
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:42,660
'Perhaps, Madame, you heard someone not in  

830
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,400
your own compartment but in the 
compartment of the murdered man.'

831
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,440
'Certainly not! And I can prove it!'

832
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,140
From her handbag, she 
produced a small metal button.

833
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,020
'You see this? I found it this 
morning in my compartment.'

834
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,080
As she placed the button on 
the table, M. Bouc cried,  

835
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,400
'This is a button from a conductor's uniform!'

836
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:23,580
'It probably fell off Michel's uniform when he was 
helping Madame Hubbard last night,' said Poirot.

837
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:29,820
'Why don't you people believe 
me?' cried the American woman.

838
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,680
'At bedtime last night I was reading a magazine.

839
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:41,040
When I switched off the light, I put the 
magazine on the floor near the window.

840
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:48,780
Last night, after the man had been in my room, 
the conductor went nowhere near the window,  

841
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:53,820
but in the morning the button 
was on top of the magazine.

842
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,100
What do you call that?'

843
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:03,120
'I call that evidence, Madame,' 
replied the detective seriously.

844
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,860
'Now, can I ask you a few questions?'

845
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,700
'Of course,' said Mrs Hubbard.

846
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,200
'You were nervous of this man Ratchett.

847
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:22,620
So why had you not already bolted 
the door between the compartments?'

848
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:24,660
'I had.

849
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:31,020
Or at least, I had asked that Swedish lady if 
it was bolted, and she had said that it was.'

850
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,560
'Why couldn't you see for yourself?'

851
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,960
'I was in bed and my sponge bag 
was hanging on the door handle.'

852
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,780
'When was this?'

853
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,960
'About half past ten, I think.

854
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,380
The Swedish lady had come 
to ask me for an aspirin.'

855
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,840
'Do you remember the case 
of the Armstrong kidnap?'

856
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,300
'Of course I do.

857
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,120
I didn't know the Armstrongs personally.

858
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,660
They moved in higher society than I.

859
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:07,440
But I've always heard that 
they were a lovely couple.

860
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:12,960
Oh, that evil man Cassetti -'

861
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,980
'Ratchett was Cassetti,' said Poirot.

862
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,960
'Cassetti, on this train! I can't 
believe it! I must tell my daughter.'

863
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,580
'Now, Madame, just one more thing.

864
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,180
Do you have a red dressing gown?'

865
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,920
'What an odd question! No, I don't.'

866
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,300
Poirot helped her towards the door.

867
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:49,320
At the last moment he said, 'You have 
dropped your handkerchief, Madame.'

868
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,720
She looked at the little piece of 
material that he was holding out to her.

869
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,880
'That isn't mine.

870
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,680
It's much too small - mine are a sensible size.'

871
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,400
'Ah!' said the detective.

872
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,100
'It had an H on it.

873
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,320
I thought it must be yours.'

874
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,360
CHAPTER FOUR

875
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,340
An Open Door

876
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:23,340
As Mrs Hubbard left, M. Bouc said anxiously,  

877
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:29,100
'I hope this button doesn't mean 
that Pierre Michel is the murderer.'

878
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:34,920
'That button is interesting,' said Poirot.

879
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:40,140
'But let us interview the Swedish 
lady before we discuss it.'

880
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,980
He looked through the pile of passports.

881
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,320
'Here we are.

882
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,400
Greta Ohlsson, age forty-nine.'

883
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,020
M. Bouc asked the waiter to invite her in.

884
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,460
The woman with a sheep-like 
face and fair hair entered.

885
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,440
She looked quite calm.

886
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,320
'You know what happened last night?' asked Poirot.

887
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,300
'Yes.

888
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,540
It is terrible,' she replied.

889
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,680
'You will understand, Mademoiselle,  

890
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:22,440
that I must ask everyone about their 
movements last night after dinner.'

891
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,140
'Of course.

892
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,060
Well, I spent most of the 
evening in my compartment,  

893
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:35,100
but I did go to see the 
American lady, Mrs Hubbard.

894
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,500
She gave me some aspirin.'

895
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:46,020
'Did she ask if the door between her 
compartment and Mr Ratchett's was bolted?'

896
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,540
'Yes, she did.

897
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:49,800
And it was.'

898
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,040
'And after that?'

899
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,620
'I went back to my bed, took 
the aspirin and fell asleep.'

900
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:05,640
'Your compartment is this 
one?' He pointed to the plan.

901
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,760
'Yes, I think so.

902
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,420
I am sharing with a young English lady.

903
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,860
Very nice.

904
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,800
She has travelled from Baghdad.'

905
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,840
'Did she leave the compartment during the night?'

906
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,320
'No, I am sure she did not.'

907
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,720
'Why are you sure if you were asleep?'

908
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,540
'I wake very easily.

909
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,480
She was sleeping in the bed above mine.

910
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,360
I always notice when she comes down.'

911
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,860
'Did you leave the compartment?'

912
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,040
'Not until this morning.'

913
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,900
'Do you have a red dressing gown?'

914
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,480
'No, I do not.

915
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,340
Mine is brown.'

916
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,040
'Have you ever been to America, Mademoiselle?'

917
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,560
'Sadly, no.

918
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,720
I like the Americans.

919
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,100
They give a lot of money to 
schools and hospitals in Turkey.

920
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:13,680
Why do you ask?'

921
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,000
Poirot explained about the Armstrong case.

922
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,820
Greta Ohlsson left the interview 
room shaking her head and crying,  

923
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,780
'How can there be such evil in the world?'

924
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,820
Poirot spent some time writing notes.

925
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:43,980
'The conductor said that Mrs Hubbard's 
bell rang some time after 1 a.m.'

926
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:52,980
'Yes, it seems quite clear that the 
murder happened at 1.15,' said M. Bouc.

927
01:11:53,640 --> 01:12:00,480
'That fits the evidence of the watch and the 
stories of the conductor and Mrs Hubbard.

928
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,060
And I think I can guess who the murderer is.

929
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,520
It is the big Italian.

930
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:16,020
Italians always kill with a knife, 
and this one has lived in America.

931
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:22,800
He and Ratchett probably worked in 
this kidnapping business together.

932
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:27,000
Then Ratchett cheated him.

933
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,120
The Italian wanted revenge.

934
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:34,560
He sent threatening letters 
and then he killed him.

935
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,780
Very simple.'

936
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:43,380
'Simple except for the manservant 
with the toothache, who says that  

937
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:48,600
the Italian never left the 
compartment,' said Poirot.

938
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:57,540
'Yes, that is a difficulty, but it will all 
be explained,' said M. Bouc confidently.

939
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,020
The detective shook his head.

940
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,760
'No, it is not as simple as that, I fear.

941
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:12,240
But let us hear what Pierre Michel 
can tell us about this button.'

942
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,980
The conductor was called and shown the button.

943
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,960
'It seems certain,' said M. Bouc,  

944
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:28,920
'that the murderer passed through Mrs 
Hubbard's compartment and dropped that button.'

945
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,460
Michel was very upset.

946
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:39,600
'It is not mine, Monsieur! Look 
- my uniform has lost no buttons.

947
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,880
I am innocent of this crime!'

948
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:48,060
'Where were you when Mrs Hubbard's bell rang?'

949
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,660
'In the next carriage, Monsieur.

950
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,940
I was talking to a colleague.'

951
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,820
The colleague was called.

952
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,360
His story agreed with Michel's.

953
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:07,320
The buttons of all the other conductors' 
uniforms were checked, and none were missing.

954
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:15,360
'Monsieur, do you see now? I 
am not guilty!' cried Michel.

955
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,460
'Calm yourself, Michel,' said M. Bouc.

956
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,340
'Think back to last night.

957
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:32,400
When you ran to answer Mrs Hubbard's 
bell, did you see anyone in the corridor?'

958
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,800
'No, Monsieur.'

959
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,780
'That is no surprise,' said Poirot.

960
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:44,580
'Mrs Hubbard lay with her eyes closed for some  

961
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,720
time after she realised that there 
was someone in her compartment.

962
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,440
The man probably went out then.

963
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,640
If the murderer was one of the passengers,  

964
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:02,880
he had time to get back to his own 
compartment before Michel arrived.'

965
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:09,480
'We still have eight passengers 
to interview,' said M. Bouc.

966
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,500
'Shall we see the Italian next?'

967
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:21,240
'You think only of your Italian!' laughed Poirot.

968
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,960
'No, we will see the Princess first.

969
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,560
Michel, could you ask her to come in?'  

970
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,580
Princess Dragomiroff looked 
even uglier than the day before,  

971
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,500
but intelligence and energy 
shone from her small, dark eyes.

972
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,540
As M. Bouc apologised for troubling her, 
she stopped him in her deep, clear voice.

973
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,060
'Murder is a serious matter, Monsieur.

974
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,620
I am happy to help you in any way that I can.'

975
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,240
'Thank you, Madame,' said Poirot.

976
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:11,880
'You are Princess Natalia Dragomiroff, 
travelling to your home in Paris?'

977
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,160
'Yes.

978
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,380
My maid is with me.'

979
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:22,800
'Please could you tell us your 
movements last night after dinner?'

980
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,500
'Willingly.

981
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,220
I went to bed straight after the meal.

982
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,360
I read until eleven, then turned out the light.

983
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:39,840
I was unable to sleep because of 
pains that I often have in my legs.

984
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,060
At about a quarter to one I rang for my maid.

985
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,380
She read to me until I felt sleepy.

986
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:54,000
I am not sure exactly when she left me.

987
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,240
After half an hour, perhaps.'

988
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,820
'You have been in America, I suppose, Madame?'

989
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,680
The sudden change of subject 
surprised the old lady.

990
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,200
'Many times.'

991
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:17,160
'Did you at any time meet 
a family called Armstrong?'

992
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:28,080
Her voice shook as she said, 'If you mean 
Sonia and Robert Armstrong, then yes.

993
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,680
Sonia was my goddaughter.

994
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,300
Her mother,

995
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:38,460
the actress Linda Arden, 
was a close friend of mine.'

996
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,200
'Linda Arden is dead now?'

997
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,360
'She is alive, but she sees no one.

998
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,720
Her health is very poor.'

999
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,220
'There was, I think, a second daughter?'

1000
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,960
'Yes, much younger than Mrs Armstrong.'

1001
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,080
'Where is she now?'

1002
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,280
The old woman looked at him in surprise.

1003
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,940
'What connection do these questions 
have with the murder on this train?'

1004
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:24,420
'The murdered man was responsible for the 
kidnap and murder of Mrs Armstrong's child.'

1005
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,740
'Ah!' Princess Dragomiroff 
sat straighter in her chair.

1006
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,900
'Then this murder is a very happy event.

1007
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:42,060
You will excuse my strong opinion on the subject.'

1008
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,880
'Of course, Madame.

1009
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:48,720
Now we must return to my earlier question.

1010
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,820
Where is the younger daughter of Linda Arden?'

1011
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,080
'I honestly cannot tell you, Monsieur.

1012
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,200
I have lost contact with her.

1013
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:09,480
I believe she married an Englishman some years 
ago, but I'm afraid I cannot remember his name.'

1014
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:18,060
She paused for a minute and then said, 
'Is there anything else, gentlemen?'

1015
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,780
'Just one thing, Madame.

1016
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,960
The colour of your dressing gown.'

1017
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,660
'I suppose you have a good reason for asking this.

1018
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,580
It is blue.'

1019
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,220
'That is all.

1020
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,380
Thank you for your help.'

1021
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:47,880
Count and Countess Andrenyi were called next, but 
the Count entered the restaurant carriage alone.

1022
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:52,680
He was a fine-looking man - tall, well-built,  

1023
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,000
with a long moustache and dressed 
in an expensive English suit.

1024
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,020
'Well, gentlemen,' he said, 
'what can I do for you?'

1025
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:12,000
'As you know,' said Poirot, 'there 
was a murder here last night, and  

1026
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,540
I must ask certain questions of the passengers.'

1027
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,940
'Of course.

1028
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:23,940
I am afraid, though, that my wife and I 
were asleep and heard nothing at all.'

1029
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,980
'Do you know who was murdered, Monsieur?'

1030
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,580
'The big American, I understand.'

1031
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:34,860
'Yes.

1032
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,440
His name was Cassetti.

1033
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,480
He was responsible for some 
terrible crimes in America.'

1034
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,640
The Count showed no sign of emotion at this news.

1035
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,160
'That explains his murder, I suppose,' he said.

1036
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,960
'You have been to America perhaps, Monsieur?'

1037
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,860
'I was in Washington for a year.'

1038
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,180
'Did you know the Armstrong family?'

1039
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:12,780
'Armstrong - Armstrong - it 
is difficult to remember.

1040
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,700
There were so many names.'

1041
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,740
He smiled.

1042
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,620
'But returning to the murder, gentleman, 
what more can I do to help you?'

1043
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,780
'When did you go to bed last night, Monsieur?'

1044
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,840
'At about eleven o'clock.

1045
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,620
We both slept until morning and noticed nothing.

1046
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,220
I am sorry we cannot help you in any way.'

1047
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,800
'Thank you, Monsieur.'

1048
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,340
'You won't need to speak to my wife.

1049
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,400
She can tell you nothing more than I have.'

1050
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,840
Poirot's expression changed slightly.

1051
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:56,640
'I am sure that is true,' he said.

1052
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,960
'But I must have a little talk with the Countess.'

1053
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:05,580
'It is quite unnecessary,' said the Count.

1054
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:12,240
'I'm afraid it is necessary - 
for my report, you understand.'

1055
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,000
'As you wish,' he said, and went to tell her.

1056
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,020
Poirot looked at the Count's passport.

1057
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:27,120
Travelling with wife, he read.

1058
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:38,940
Name: Elena Maria Andrenyi Surname 
before marriage: Goldenberg Age: 20

1059
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,100
An ink spot had been dropped on 
the page by a careless official.

1060
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,360
Countess Andrenyi entered the restaurant carriage.

1061
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,880
'You wish to see me, gentlemen?' 
she asked in perfect French.

1062
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:58,080
'Thank you, Countess,' said Poirot.

1063
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:05,520
'I only need to ask you if you saw or 
heard anything unusual last night.'

1064
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,280
'No, nothing.

1065
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,640
I had taken medicine to help me sleep.'

1066
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,580
'Did you go with your husband to America, Madame?'

1067
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,460
'No, Monsieur.

1068
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,500
We were not married then.

1069
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,200
We have only been married a year.'

1070
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,200
She smiled shyly.

1071
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:36,360
With her big, dark eyes and bright red lips, 
she looked very foreign - and very beautiful.

1072
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,140
'Why did you ask me that?'

1073
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,540
'Detectives have to ask a 
lot of strange questions.

1074
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:50,580
For example, what colour is your dressing gown?'

1075
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,180
'It is a cream colour.

1076
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,100
Is that important?'

1077
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,860
'Very important.

1078
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:03,480
And does your husband smoke a pipe?'

1079
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,860
'No - cigarettes, but not a pipe.'

1080
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:13,560
'Do you speak English?' he asked in that language.

1081
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,220
'I speak a little, yes.'

1082
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,480
Her accent was strong, but very attractive.

1083
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,600
'And that is all,' the detective said.

1084
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,800
'You see, Madame, it was not so terrible.'

1085
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,000
She smiled and walked out of the carriage.

1086
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,000
'That was not very useful,' said M. Bouc.

1087
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,360
'Shall we see the Italian now?'

1088
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,380
Poirot did not reply for a moment.

1089
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,340
He was studying the ink spot 
on the Hungarian passport.

1090
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,540
Finally he looked at M. Bouc.

1091
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,520
'We will leave your Italian 
for the moment, my friend,  

1092
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:08,080
and interview the good-looking 
Englishman, Colonel Arbuthnot.'

1093
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:18,000
When the Colonel arrived, Poirot said, 'You 
are travelling from India to Britain, I think.

1094
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,360
Why are you not going by boat?'

1095
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:29,940
'I chose to take the overland route for reasons 
of my own,' said the Colonel unhelpfully.

1096
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,160
'I see.

1097
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,760
You came straight through from India?'

1098
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,920
'I stopped for three days in 
Baghdad to visit an old friend.'

1099
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:48,060
'You met the young English lady 
there, perhaps - Miss Debenham?'

1100
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,700
'No, I did not.

1101
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,640
I first met Miss Debenham on the train.'

1102
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:01,500
'We think that M. Ratchett was murdered 
at a quarter past one last night.

1103
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,860
What were you doing at that time?'

1104
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,500
'I was talking to the young 
American - the dead man's secretary.

1105
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,600
We were in his compartment.'

1106
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,120
'Did you know M. MacQueen before this journey?'

1107
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:19,980
'No.

1108
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:24,600
We started talking yesterday and 
we enjoyed each other's company.

1109
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:29,520
I don't usually like 
Americans, but I like MacQueen.

1110
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:36,300
We had a long discussion about India, 
and America, and the world in general.

1111
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:42,480
I was quite surprised when I looked at my 
watch and found that it was a quarter to two.'

1112
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:47,040
'That is the time that you 
stopped this conversation?'

1113
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,720
'Yes.'

1114
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,420
'What did you do then?'

1115
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,920
'I walked back to my own 
compartment and went to bed.'

1116
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:04,320
'Now, Colonel, I want you to think back 
to your conversation with M. MacQueen.

1117
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,860
You got out at Vincovci?'

1118
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:10,860
'Yes, but only for about a minute.

1119
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,260
It was snowing very hard.'

1120
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,980
'So you came back in.

1121
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,960
You sat down again.

1122
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:27,780
You smoked - perhaps a cigarette, 
perhaps a pipe He paused for a moment.

1123
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,240
'A pipe for me.

1124
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,400
MacQueen smoked cigarettes.'

1125
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,720
'The train started again.

1126
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,740
Did anyone pass the door after that?'

1127
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,580
'I don't remember anyone except the conductor.

1128
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,740
Wait a minute - there was a woman too, I think.

1129
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,780
She was wearing something red.'

1130
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,120
'Thank you.

1131
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,680
Have you ever been in America, Colonel?'

1132
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,360
'Never.

1133
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,700
I have no interest in going there.'

1134
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:07,860
'Did you ever know a Colonel Armstrong?'

1135
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:14,220
'Armstrong - Armstrong - I've 
known two or three Armstrongs.

1136
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,360
Do you mean Selby Armstrong? Or Tommy?'

1137
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:22,800
'I mean Colonel Robert Armstrong,  

1138
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:29,280
who married an American and whose 
only child was kidnapped and killed.'

1139
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,420
'Ah, I remember reading about that.

1140
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,220
But I didn't know him.'

1141
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:41,340
'The murdered man was 
responsible for that kidnap.'

1142
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,600
'Really? Then he deserved to die - although 
it's a pity that it wasn't done legally,  

1143
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,340
through the courts, of course.

1144
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,320
You can't go around murdering people 
out of revenge, like Corsicans.'

1145
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,640
Poirot looked at the Colonel thoughtfully.

1146
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:09,360
'I have no more questions - unless you 
noticed anything unusual last night?'  

1147
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,840
Arbuthnot thought for a moment.

1148
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,480
'No,' he said.

1149
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,260
'Nothing.

1150
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,340
Unless -' He paused.

1151
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,580
'Yes?' said the detective.

1152
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,340
'Well, it's nothing really.

1153
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:33,480
But when I got back to my compartment, I 
noticed that the door of the end compartment -'

1154
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,220
'Number 16?'

1155
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,900
'Yes, the door to it was not quite closed.

1156
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:46,140
The man inside looked out in a secretive 
way, then quickly closed the door.

1157
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,420
It seemed a bit strange.'

1158
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:53,280
'Yes,' said Poirot doubtfully.

1159
01:29:55,740 --> 01:30:00,480
When the soldier had left the carriage, 
Poirot stared into space for some time.

1160
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:07,080
Then he said, 'Colonel Arbuthnot smokes a pipe.

1161
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:12,120
In M. Ratchett's compartment 
I found a pipe cleaner.'

1162
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,140
'You think -?' began M. Bouc.

1163
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:21,780
'He was also in the same 
army as Colonel Armstrong.

1164
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:28,740
He said that he did not know 
him, but perhaps that was a lie.'

1165
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,180
'So it is possible that -?'

1166
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:35,340
Poirot shook his head angrily.

1167
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:40,440
'No, it is impossible that this Englishman,  

1168
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:47,880
who believes in law and order, could push 
a knife into his enemy twelve times.'

1169
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,100
CHAPTER FIVE

1170
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,740
The Man with a Woman's Voice

1171
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:01,080
The detective's thoughts 
turned to the next interview.

1172
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:07,020
'The American in compartment 16, I think.'

1173
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:14,160
The American soon came in, wearing a 
brightly coloured suit and a pink shirt.

1174
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,220
He had a wide, friendly face.

1175
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,320
'Good morning, gentlemen,' he said.

1176
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,840
'What can I do for you?'

1177
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:32,700
'You have heard of this 
murder, Mr - er - Hardman?'

1178
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,740
'Yes.'

1179
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:39,060
'We are interviewing all the passengers.

1180
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:45,420
You are -' Poirot looked quickly 
at the passport in front of him.

1181
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:52,440
'- forty-one years of age, and 
a salesman of office machines?'

1182
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,500
'Yes, that's me.'

1183
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:00,720
'You are travelling for business reasons?'

1184
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,460
'That's right.'

1185
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,340
'Can you tell us anything about 
the events of last night?'

1186
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,800
'Nothing at all.

1187
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,520
Sorry.'

1188
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,060
'Ah, that is a pity.

1189
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:23,880
Perhaps, Mr Hardman, you will tell us exactly 
what you did after dinner last night?'

1190
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:32,820
Hardman paused, then said, 'Excuse 
me, but who are you exactly?'

1191
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,520
'I am Hercule Poirot.

1192
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:45,540
I have been hired by the Compagnie Internationale 
des Wagons Lits to solve this crime.'

1193
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,700
'I've heard of you,' said Mr Hardman.

1194
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,980
He thought for a

1195
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:58,320
minute more, then said, 'I 
suppose I should be honest.'

1196
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:05,400
'You should certainly tell us 
all that you know,' said Poirot.

1197
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:13,140
The American now spoke in a different voice - in 
fact, he seemed a completely different person.

1198
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:17,760
'Well, as I said, I don't know anything.

1199
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:19,920
But I should know something.'

1200
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:24,600
'Please explain, Mr Hardman.'

1201
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:29,820
'Some of the information in my passport is false.

1202
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,500
This is who I really am.'

1203
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,980
He produced a card from his pocket.

1204
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,620
Mr CYRUS B.

1205
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,280
HARDMAN

1206
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,680
McNeil's Private Detectives

1207
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:42,120
New York

1208
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,360
Poirot knew the name of the company.

1209
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,660
McNeil's had an excellent reputation.

1210
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:55,860
'I'd gone to Istanbul after a couple of 
criminals - no connection with this business.

1211
01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:00,240
I was planning my journey home 
to New York when I got this.'

1212
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,060
He pushed across a letter.

1213
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,000
Dear Sir,

1214
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,620
I understand that you are a private detective.

1215
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:16,020
Please come to my rooms at 
four o'clock this afternoon.

1216
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:25,140
It was written on notepaper from the Tokatlian 
Hotel in Istanbul and was signed 'S.E.

1217
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:26,760
Ratchett'.

1218
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:33,060
'I went to see Ratchett, and he showed me 
some threatening letters that he had received.

1219
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,900
He hired me for protection on his journey west.

1220
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:41,280
Well, my protection wasn't very good, was it?'

1221
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:44,880
'How had you hoped to protect him?'

1222
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:51,000
'I had planned to travel in the 
next-door compartment, but it was taken.

1223
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,480
Number 16 was in a good position, though.

1224
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:59,280
No one could reach Mr Ratchett's 
compartment without passing mine.'

1225
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:07,080
'You had no idea, I suppose, 
who the possible attacker was?'

1226
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,500
'Well, I knew what he looked like.

1227
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,080
Mr Ratchett described him to me.'

1228
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:19,740
'What?' His three listeners 
almost jumped out of their seats.

1229
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,560
Hardman continued.

1230
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,760
'A small man, dark, with a high voice

1231
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:27,840
like a woman's.

1232
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,660
That's how Ratchett described him.'

1233
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,160
'Did you know that Ratchett was 
Cassetti, the Armstrong murderer?'

1234
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,820
Mr Hardman looked shocked.

1235
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,060
'No, I didn't recognise him.

1236
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,020
I'd seen photos of Cassetti 
in the papers, I suppose,  

1237
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:52,800
but I wouldn't recognise my own 
mother in one of those photos.'

1238
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,040
'Please, M. Hardman, continue your story.'

1239
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:02,460
'There's not much to tell.

1240
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,560
I slept in the day and stayed awake 
watching the corridor at night.

1241
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:12,420
Nothing happened the first night and I 
thought the same was true last night.

1242
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,640
No stranger passed.'

1243
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:19,680
'You are sure of that, M. Hardman?'

1244
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:21,660
'Yes, I am.

1245
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:22,620
I'm certain.'

1246
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,640
'Then I think we have finished.

1247
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,320
Thank you.'

1248
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:32,160
Poirot offered the American a cigarette.

1249
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,300
'But perhaps you prefer a pipe?'

1250
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,160
'Not me.

1251
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,560
It was nice to meet you, Mr Poirot.'

1252
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,360
He took a cigarette and walked away.

1253
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,600
The three men looked at each other.

1254
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:59,760
'A small man, dark, with a high voice like 
a woman's,' said M. Bouc thoughtfully.

1255
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:07,140
'A description which fits no 
one on the train,' said Poirot.

1256
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:15,660
He paused, then said with a smile, 
'And now we will make M. Bouc happy.

1257
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,660
We will see the Italian.'

1258
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,860
A man with dark skin and a pleasant,  

1259
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:30,360
cheerful face was soon walking across 
the restaurant carriage towards them.

1260
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:37,680
'Your name is Antonio Foscarelli, from Italy?'

1261
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,500
'Yes, Monsieur, but I have 
become an American citizen.

1262
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,960
It is better for my business.'

1263
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,120
He smiled.

1264
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:52,200
'You sell Ford motor cars?'

1265
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,620
'Yes, you see -'

1266
01:37:55,620 --> 01:38:00,120
A long explanation of Foscarelli's 
business methods followed,  

1267
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:03,060
before Poirot could continue his questions.

1268
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:10,080
'So you have lived in the United 
States for the last ten years?'

1269
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,600
'Yes, Monsieur.

1270
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,000
I remember the day that I left.

1271
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,400
My mother -'

1272
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,960
Poirot interrupted him.

1273
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:23,640
'Did you ever meet Mr Ratchett in America?'

1274
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,200
'No, but I met many people like him.

1275
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:36,960
On the outside, very polite, very 
well-dressed, but underneath - evil.

1276
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,280
In my opinion, Ratchett was a criminal.'

1277
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:47,100
'Your opinion is correct,' said Poirot.

1278
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,300
'Ratchett was Cassetti, the kidnapper.'

1279
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:57,060
'What did I tell you? I am 
good at reading people's faces.

1280
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,400
It is important in my work.'

1281
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:04,320
'You remember the Armstrong case?'

1282
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:06,900
'Not very well.

1283
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:12,120
It was a little girl, wasn't it? A terrible crime,  

1284
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:17,460
but these things happen, even in 
a great country like America.'

1285
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,940
'Did you ever meet any members 
of the Armstrong family?'

1286
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,860
'I don't think so, but it is difficult to say.

1287
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:33,400
Last year alone I sold cars to -'

1288
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,700
Poirot interrupted him again.

1289
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:42,120
'Monsieur, please tell me what 
you did last night after dinner.'

1290
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,760
'With pleasure.

1291
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,100
I went back to my compartment.

1292
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:53,460
An English servant shares the 
compartment with me but he was out.

1293
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:59,640
Then he came back, but he 
wasn't interested in talking.

1294
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,360
"Yes", "No" - nothing else.

1295
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,880
He was very unfriendly.

1296
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,420
He read his book and I read mine.

1297
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,720
I smoked a cigarette or two.

1298
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,880
He had toothache, and he was 
making a lot of noise about it.

1299
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:25,320
I went to sleep, but I woke up a few 
times to the sound of his complaining.'

1300
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:30,960
'Did he leave the compartment 
at all during the night?'

1301
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:33,780
'I don't think so.

1302
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:40,620
When the door opens, the light from the corridor 
comes in very brightly and wakes you up.'

1303
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:46,920
With words of thanks, Poirot 
brought the interview to an end.

1304
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:53,700
'Well, he has been in America for a long time,'  

1305
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:58,020
said M. Bouc when Foscarelli 
had left the carriage.

1306
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:06,000
'He is Italian - Italians are good 
at lying and love using knives.

1307
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:09,060
I don't like Italians.'

1308
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,340
'That is very clear,' smiled Poirot.

1309
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:19,200
'But there is no evidence against this man.

1310
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:25,080
Italians use knives, yes, but in a fight, when

1311
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,340
they are angry.

1312
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:31,260
This murder was very carefully planned.'

1313
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:35,520
He picked up the last two passports.

1314
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,920
'Let us see Miss Mary Debenham next.'

1315
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:48,120
Miss Debenham entered the restaurant carriage 
calmly, dressed in a little black suit.

1316
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,420
She sat down opposite Poirot.

1317
01:41:53,280 --> 01:42:02,760
'Your name is Mary Hermione Debenham, you are 
English, and you are twenty-six years old?'  

1318
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,980
began Poirot.

1319
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:06,840
'Yes.'

1320
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:13,800
'Now, Miss Debenham, what can you 
tell us about last night's events?'

1321
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,500
'Nothing, I'm afraid.

1322
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,660
I went to bed and slept.'

1323
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,620
Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.

1324
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,620
'You are travelling from 
Baghdad to London, I believe.'

1325
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:30,720
'Yes.'

1326
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:34,320
'What have you been doing in Baghdad?'

1327
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,460
'I have been working as 
governess to two children.'

1328
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,660
'Have you ever been to America?'

1329
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:46,860
'America? No, never.'

1330
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:54,900
'What is your opinion of the lady who 
shares your compartment - Miss Ohlsson?'

1331
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,980
'She seems a pleasant, simple person.'

1332
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,060
'What colour is her dressing gown?'

1333
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,480
Mary Debenham looked surprised.

1334
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,760
'A brown colour.'

1335
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:14,340
'And I noticed your dressing 
gown on the train to Istanbul.

1336
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:17,520
It is purple, I believe.'

1337
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,160
'Yes, that is right.'

1338
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:28,500
'Have you got any other dressing gown, 
Miss Debenham? A red one, for example?'

1339
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,440
'No, that is not mine.'

1340
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:37,620
The detective moved forward quickly, 
like a cat jumping on a mouse.

1341
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:47,940
'Not yours? So you know that the red dressing 
gown belongs to someone else! Whose is it?'

1342
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,960
The girl moved back, a little shocked.

1343
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,080
'I don't know,' she replied.

1344
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,420
'I saw someone wearing it last night in 
the corridor, but I didn't see her face.'

1345
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:05,640
'Was she tall or short? Fair or dark?'

1346
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,900
She had a hat on, so I couldn't see her hair.

1347
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:13,440
But she was tall and thin.

1348
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,900
It was a Chinese-style dressing gown.'

1349
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,980
Yes, that's right, Chinese.'

1350
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,060
The detective was silent for a minute.

1351
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:28,740
Then he said to himself, 'I cannot understand.

1352
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:32,580
None of this makes sense.'

1353
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:39,540
Looking up, he said to Miss Debenham, 
'We do not need you any more.

1354
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,340
You can go.'

1355
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:49,980
When she had left, M. Bouc stared at his 
friend with a confused look on his face.

1356
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:57,660
'You think she is guilty, 
don't you?' he said slowly.

1357
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:07,560
'But why? She seems a very pleasant young lady - 
the last person in the world to be a murderer.'

1358
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,180
'I agree,' said Constantine.

1359
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:14,880
'She is a very calm person.

1360
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,400
She would not murder her enemy.

1361
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,080
She would take him to court.'

1362
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,760
'There is an unemotional, 
intelligent brain behind this crime.

1363
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:32,880
Miss Debenham fits the description 
of the murderer exactly.'

1364
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,480
M. Bouc shook his head.

1365
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,520
'You are wrong, my friend.

1366
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,760
That young woman is not a criminal.'

1367
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:47,040
'I have another reason to 
think carefully about her.

1368
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:53,340
I have not yet told you what I heard 
during my journey to Istanbul.'

1369
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:01,200
He told the two men about Miss Debenham's words 
to Colonel Arbuthnot on the platform at Konya.

1370
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,400
M. Bouc repeated the words thoughtfully.

1371
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:07,680
'"Not now.

1372
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,540
When it's all over.

1373
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:16,020
When it's behind us." That is certainly strange.

1374
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:21,780
It suggests that she and the 
Colonel are both responsible.'

1375
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:29,340
'Yes, but there are other people who tell 
us that they could not be the murderers.

1376
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:37,320
The stories of the Swedish woman and Mr MacQueen 
seem to prove that they are both innocent.

1377
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:41,520
No, that solution does not work.

1378
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:47,580
Ah well,' continued the detective, 
picking up the last passport,  

1379
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:57,600
'let us see our last passenger - Princess 
Dragomiroff's German maid, Hildegarde Schmidt.'

1380
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:08,220
When the maid entered, Poirot asked her gently, 
in German, about her movements the night before.

1381
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,380
'I do not know anything, Monsieur,' she said.

1382
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,760
'Your employer sent for you last night, I believe.

1383
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,520
Do you remember the time?'

1384
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,860
'No, Monsieur.

1385
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,500
I was asleep when the conductor called me.'

1386
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:30,840
'Do you often go to your 
employer's room at night?'

1387
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,800
'It is not unusual, Monsieur.

1388
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,360
She does not sleep well.'

1389
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,540
'And did you put on your dressing 
gown to go to her compartment?'

1390
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:48,000
'That would not be right, 
Monsieur! I put on my day clothes.'

1391
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,660
'Although it is a very nice 
dressing gown - red, I think?'

1392
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,120
She stared at him.

1393
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,060
'It is dark blue, Monsieur!'

1394
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:07,080
'Ah! My mistake! So, you went 
to the Princess's compartment.

1395
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,360
What did you do there?'

1396
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:12,480
'I read to her.

1397
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:19,440
Then I returned to my own compartment to get her 
an extra blanket, and finally went back to bed.'

1398
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,820
'Do you know what time that was?'

1399
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,280
'No, Monsieur.'

1400
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:30,600
'And you met no one in the corridor?'

1401
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:32,760
'No, Monsieur.

1402
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,580
There was nobody there except the conductor.

1403
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:37,500
Everyone was asleep.'

1404
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:41,160
'But you did see the conductor.

1405
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,080
What was he doing?'

1406
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,640
'He came out of one of the 
compartments, Monsieur.'

1407
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,640
M. Bouc moved forward.

1408
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,780
'Which one,' he asked urgently.

1409
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,360
The maid looked frightened.

1410
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:00,540
'One of the middle ones, Monsieur.

1411
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,820
Two or three doors from the Princess's.'

1412
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,200
'Please tell us exactly what happened.'

1413
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:13,440
'He almost ran into me as I was 
taking the blanket to the Princess.

1414
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,660
Then he apologised and 
continued down the corridor.

1415
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:24,360
A bell began ringing, but I 
do not think he answered it.'

1416
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,060
'This poor conductor,' said Poirot.

1417
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,860
'He had a busy night.

1418
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,500
First he had to wake you.

1419
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,320
Then there was that bell.'

1420
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:41,760
'He was not the conductor who woke me, Monsieur.

1421
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,020
It was another one.'

1422
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:49,680
'Another one? Would you recognise 
him if you saw him again?'

1423
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,800
'I think so, Monsieur.'

1424
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:57,806
Poirot whispered something in M. Bouc's ear.

1425
01:49:57,806 --> 01:50:00,420
M. Bouc went to the door to give an order.

1426
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:07,620
'Have you ever been to America?' 
the detective continued.

1427
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,560
'Never, Monsieur.

1428
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,060
It must be a fine country.'

1429
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,140
He took a handkerchief from his pocket.

1430
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:23,760
'Is this yours?' There was a moment's 
silence as the woman examined it.

1431
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,400
Her face went a little red.

1432
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:31,380
'No, it is not mine,' she replied.

1433
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:37,500
'It has the letter H, you see - for Hildegarde.'

1434
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,100
'Really, it is not mine.

1435
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:47,100
This is an expensive handkerchief, 
Monsieur, the handkerchief of a fine lady.'

1436
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:52,380
'You do not know which fine lady?'

1437
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:57,600
Poirot noticed that there 
was a slight pause before she

1438
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:01,380
answered, 'I? Oh, no, Monsieur.'

1439
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,940
M. Bouc now whispered in Poirot's ear.

1440
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:12,480
The detective said, 'The three 
conductors are coming in, Mademoiselle.

1441
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:21,960
Please could you tell me which one almost ran 
into you last night?' The three men entered.

1442
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,480
Hildegarde Schmidt looked at them 
and immediately shook her head.

1443
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,360
'No, Monsieur.

1444
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:33,360
None of these is the man that I saw last night.

1445
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,720
These are all tall, big men.

1446
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:42,300
I saw a small, dark man with a little moustache.

1447
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:50,100
When he said "Excuse me", his 
voice was weak, like a woman's.

1448
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:53,640
I remember him very well, Monsieur.'

1449
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,240
CHAPTER SIX

1450
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:01,980
The Sponge Bag

1451
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:07,920
'A small dark man with a high voice,'  

1452
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:13,440
said M. Bouc when the conductors and 
Hildegarde Schmidt had left the carriage.

1453
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,120
'That is the enemy that Ratchett described!  

1454
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:27,600
But where is he now? He didn't leave the 
train, but he isn't on the train either.'

1455
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:34,740
'Like you, I am very confused,' said Poirot.

1456
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:42,660
'In this situation, it is always best to 
return to the facts that we can be sure about.

1457
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:51,000
'Fact one: Ratchett, or Cassetti, 
was murdered in his bed last night,  

1458
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,240
with twelve knife wounds in the chest.

1459
01:52:55,260 --> 01:53:01,680
Fact two: his watch had stopped 
at a quarter past one -'

1460
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:06,660
'So that gives us a definite time 
for the crime,' said M. Bouc.

1461
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:11,280
'Not necessarily,' said the detective.

1462
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:18,060
'It is possible that the murder happened 
earlier or later than that time,  

1463
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:24,000
and that the murderer has left 
us the watch as a false clue.

1464
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:29,040
There is also the information from Dr Constantine,  

1465
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:36,300
that at least two of the wounds were made 
some time after Ratchett was already dead.'

1466
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,840
'And what about the man in the 
conductor's uniform?' asked M. Bouc.

1467
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,180
'He is fact three.'

1468
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:48,480
'Not so fast, my friend.

1469
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,440
We must first examine the evidence carefully.

1470
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:57,240
Hardman, the detective, spoke of this man.

1471
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:04,740
Should we believe him? I think we should, 
because his story - that he was hired by  

1472
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:10,620
Ratchett - could easily be disproved by a 
quick phone call to McNeil's in New York.

1473
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:17,700
And we have other evidence that his 
story is true, from Hildegarde Schmidt.

1474
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:26,340
Her description of the man in the conductor's 
uniform matches Hardman's description exactly.

1475
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:32,760
And there is also the button found 
in Mrs Hubbard's compartment.

1476
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:41,400
So we have three separate pieces of 
evidence for this man with the high voice.'

1477
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:47,580
'Yes, yes, my friend,' said M. Bouc impatiently.

1478
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:50,640
'We all agree that he exists.

1479
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:53,100
But where did he go?'

1480
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:57,060
'Perhaps he is two people.

1481
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:07,980
I mean, he is both himself - the small, dark 
man feared by M. Ratchett - and a passenger  

1482
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:14,220
on the train, looking so different 
that Ratchett did not recognise him.'

1483
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,420
'But the men on the train are all tall,'  

1484
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:26,820
said M. Bouc, '- except the servant Masterman, 
and he is unlikely to be our murderer.'

1485
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:33,540
'The man may actually be a woman,' said Poirot.

1486
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:36,720
'That would explain the high voice.'

1487
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:43,860
'But it would not explain the wounds 
that did not bleed,' said Dr Constantine.

1488
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,500
'We must not forget those.'

1489
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:57,000
'I have forgotten nothing, Doctor, but I have 
not yet found the solution that I am looking for.

1490
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:05,280
Perhaps the woman in the red dressing gown, 
seen by several passengers including me,  

1491
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:11,640
is our second murderer - the one 
who made those wounds, Doctor.

1492
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:19,560
If we believe the female passengers, 
nobody has a red dressing gown.

1493
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:28,800
So where is it now? And where is the 
conductor's uniform with the missing button?'

1494
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,420
'Ah!' cried M. Bouc, jumping to his feet.

1495
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,320
'We must search all the passengers' luggage.'

1496
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,800
M. Poirot stood up too.

1497
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,500
'I can guess where you will 
find the uniform,' he said.

1498
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:52,920
'It will almost certainly be in the 
compartment of Hildegarde Schmidt.'

1499
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:02,160
'How -' began M. Bouc, but he was 
interrupted by screams from the corridor.

1500
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:06,240
The door flew open and Mrs Hubbard ran in.

1501
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:11,220
'It's too horrible!' she cried.

1502
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,380
'In my sponge bag.

1503
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:21,240
My sponge bag! A great knife 
- with blood all over it.'

1504
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:28,560
Then she suddenly fell forwards and 
dropped heavily into the arms of M. Bouc.

1505
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:36,780
M. Bouc moved the woman to a chair, with her head 
on the table, and followed Poirot out of the door.

1506
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,860
Dr Constantine called for a waiter.

1507
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,460
'Keep her head like that,' he said, 
then hurried after the other two.

1508
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:53,160
There was a crowd of people 
outside Mrs Hubbard's compartment,  

1509
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:56,280
wanting to see what the screams were about.

1510
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:01,260
Michel opened the door for the 
detective and his two friends.

1511
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:05,340
'The knife is there, Monsieur.

1512
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:07,200
I have not touched it.'

1513
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:14,160
Hanging on the handle of the door into the 
next compartment was a large sponge bag.

1514
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:20,640
Below it, on the floor, was a sharp 
knife, covered in dried blood.

1515
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:23,820
Poirot picked it up carefully.

1516
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:30,780
'What do you think, Doctor? 
Did this knife kill Ratchett?'  

1517
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,040
Constantine's examination did not take long.

1518
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,200
'Yes.

1519
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:41,460
All the wounds on Ratchett's body 
could be made with that knife.'

1520
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:50,640
'So,' said M. Bouc, 'the man passes through 
this compartment on his way to the corridor.

1521
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:56,220
He notices the sponge bag and 
hides the knife inside it.

1522
01:58:56,220 --> 01:59:03,420
Not even realising that he has woken 
Mrs Hubbard, he quickly leaves.'

1523
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:11,760
'Yes, no doubt,' said Poirot, but his 
mind was clearly on other matters.

1524
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:18,900
He was staring at a door bolt thirty centimetres 
above the handle where the sponge bag was hanging.

1525
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,840
His thoughts were interrupted by 
the tearful return of Mrs Hubbard.

1526
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:30,600
'I'm not going to spend another 
night in this compartment,' she said.

1527
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:35,640
'I wouldn't sleep in here again 
if you paid me a million dollars.

1528
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:40,560
Oh, if my daughter knew -'

1529
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:46,800
Poirot said loudly, 'Your luggage 
will be moved immediately, Madame.'

1530
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,820
Mrs Hubbard's crying stopped.

1531
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:53,820
'Really?' she said.

1532
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,760
'Then I feel better already.'

1533
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:04,980
Poirot told Michel to move her luggage to 
compartment number 12, in the next carriage.

1534
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:09,720
The detective then showed her 
to her new compartment himself.

1535
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,540
She looked around happily.

1536
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:16,500
This is fine,' she said.

1537
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:22,740
'And it faces the other way, so it feels 
quite different from my old compartment.

1538
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:28,500
Oh, I still can't believe that 
there was a murderer in there!'

1539
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:36,240
'The bolt on the door still 
confuses me, Madame,' said Poirot.

1540
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:40,860
'You were in bed, so you couldn't see it?'

1541
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:45,060
'That's right, because the sponge bag was there.'

1542
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:50,940
Poirot picked up the sponge bag 
and hung it on the door handle.

1543
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,360
'I see,' he said.

1544
02:00:55,260 --> 02:01:01,800
'The bolt is just underneath the handle, 
so it is hidden by the sponge bag.'

1545
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:03,780
'Exactly.

1546
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:06,780
But the Swedish lady said that it was bolted.'

1547
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,180
'She made a mistake, I suppose,' said Poirot.

1548
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,960
'Well, it was rather stupid of her, I think.'

1549
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,360
Mrs Hubbard began to worry 
about the delay to the train.

1550
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,440
'I can't possibly get to my boat in time.

1551
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:28,660
This is just too terrible -'

1552
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:33,420
M. Poirot interrupted her 
before the tears returned.

1553
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,780
'You have had a shock, Madame.

1554
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:40,020
Perhaps we should get you a cup of tea.'

1555
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,020
'A coffee would be better.

1556
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:44,340
Thank you.'

1557
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:54,540
As the coffee was brought to Mrs Hubbard, Poirot 
asked for permission to search her luggage.

1558
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:59,040
She agreed willingly, but 
nothing of interest was found.

1559
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:04,080
A search of Mr Hardman's 
compartment was no more successful,  

1560
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:09,240
but in Colonel Arbuthnot's luggage 
he discovered a packet of pipe  

1561
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:13,080
cleaners that were exactly the same 
as the one found at the crime scene.

1562
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:19,380
Poirot went next to the compartments 
of Count and Countess Andrenyi.

1563
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:24,780
As he entered, the Count was sitting 
near the door, reading a newspaper.

1564
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:28,560
His wife was curled up in a chair near the window.

1565
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:31,380
It appeared that she had been asleep.

1566
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,560
A quick search followed.

1567
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:43,560
'Here is a label all wet on your suitcase, 
Madame,' said Poirot as he lifted down a blue bag.

1568
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,760
She did not reply, but stayed curled on her 
chair, showing no interest in the visitors.

1569
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:57,480
The next compartment was shared by 
Mary Debenham and Greta Ohlsson.

1570
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,480
Poirot explained his purpose.

1571
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:08,220
'After we have examined your luggage, Miss 
Ohlsson, perhaps you could visit Mrs Hubbard.

1572
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:14,040
We have moved her into the next 
carriage, but she is still very upset.

1573
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:17,400
It might help her to talk to someone.'

1574
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:22,680
The kind Swede wanted to go and 
see Mrs Hubbard immediately.

1575
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:27,540
She left her suitcase unlocked in 
the compartment for Poirot's search.

1576
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:32,340
This was quickly done and the 
detective turned to Miss Debenham.

1577
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:34,920
She was staring at him.

1578
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:40,500
'Why did you send Miss 
Ohlsson away?' she asked him.

1579
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:44,940
'To help the American woman,' he replied.

1580
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:49,380
'A good excuse - but still an excuse.'

1581
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:51,540
She smiled.

1582
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:54,960
'You wanted to speak to me alone, didn't you?'

1583
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:00,900
'I do not plan as carefully 
as you think, Miss Debenham.'

1584
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:04,260
'Please - I am not stupid.

1585
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:10,800
For some reason, you have decided that I 
am responsible for this horrible crime.'

1586
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,220
'You are imagining things.'

1587
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:17,880
'No, I am not imagining things.

1588
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,980
Let's not waste time.

1589
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,620
Say what you want to say.'

1590
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,160
'As you wish, Mademoiselle.

1591
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:34,020
On the journey from Syria, we stopped at 
Konya and I went for a walk on the platform.

1592
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:39,180
I heard you say to Colonel Arbuthnot, "Not now.

1593
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,040
When it's all over.

1594
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:46,200
When it's behind us." What 
did you mean by those words?'

1595
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:53,820
She said very quietly, 'Do 
you think I meant - murder?'

1596
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:58,020
'I am asking you what you meant.'

1597
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,940
She sat silently for a minute, lost in thought.

1598
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:09,240
Then she said, 'Those words had a 
meaning that I cannot tell you, Monsieur.

1599
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,200
I can only promise you that I never saw this man  

1600
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:16,620
Ratchett in my life until 
I saw him on this train.'

1601
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,780
'You refuse to explain those words?'

1602
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:24,480
'I must, I'm afraid.

1603
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:28,440
There was something that I had to do -'

1604
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,720
'And now you have done it?'

1605
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:32,880
'What do you mean?'

1606
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:37,140
'There was a delay before we arrived in Istanbul.

1607
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:43,980
You were very upset - you, who are always so calm.

1608
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,140
You lost that calm.'

1609
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:49,020
'I did not want to miss my connection.'

1610
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:55,380
'But the Orient Express leaves 
Istanbul every day of the week.

1611
02:05:56,340 --> 02:06:00,660
Missing the connection meant a 
delay of only twenty- four hours.

1612
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:06,960
On this train, again we have had 
a delay - a more serious delay.

1613
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,460
But this time your behaviour is very different.

1614
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:14,220
You are not impatient at all.

1615
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:17,220
You are quite calm.'

1616
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,880
Miss Debenham's face was red.

1617
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,280
She was not smiling now.

1618
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:27,600
'You do not answer, Mademoiselle?'

1619
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:30,180
'I'm sorry.

1620
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:36,660
What do you want me to tell you?' For the first 
time she showed signs of losing her temper.

1621
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:41,340
'Tell me why your behaviour is so different.'

1622
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:43,980
'I cannot tell you.

1623
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:45,720
There is nothing to explain.'

1624
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:50,280
'It does not matter,' said Hercule Poirot.

1625
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,520
'I will find out.'

1626
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:57,540
He turned and left the compartment.

1627
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:03,240
In the next compartment, Hildegarde 
Schmidt was waiting for them.

1628
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:08,040
After looking through her 
luggage, Poirot turned to M. Bouc.

1629
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:13,740
'You remember what I said? Look here a moment.'

1630
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:20,880
There was a brown conductor's uniform 
untidily placed inside the maid's suitcase.

1631
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:24,240
The maid suddenly looked frightened.

1632
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:28,200
'That is not mine!' she cried.

1633
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:32,460
'I have not looked in that 
case since we left Istanbul.'

1634
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:39,180
Poirot touched her arm gently 
and said, 'Do not worry.

1635
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:40,740
We believe you.

1636
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,140
The man in this uniform had hoped not to be seen.

1637
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:53,160
After he ran into you in the corridor, 
he needed to hide his uniform.

1638
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,240
He saw that the door to your compartment was open,  

1639
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:02,700
so he quickly took it off and 
threw it on top of your suitcase.'

1640
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,820
He held up the jacket.

1641
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,360
A button, the third down, was missing.

1642
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,600
In the pocket was a conductor's key.

1643
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:20,160
'With that, he could lock and unlock any 
door in the carriage,' cried M. Bouc.

1644
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:26,700
'Now we must find the red 
dressing gown,' said Poirot.

1645
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:34,680
The next compartment was Mr MacQueen's, and 
after that Masterman's and the Italian's.

1646
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:40,800
Nothing of interest was found in their luggage, 
and there were no more compartments to search.

1647
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:45,600
'What shall we do now?' asked M. Bouc.

1648
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:49,620
'We have collected all the evidence that we can.

1649
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:53,820
We will go now to the 
restaurant carriage and think.

1650
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:57,000
But I will need cigarettes.

1651
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,240
I will meet you there in a few moments.'

1652
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:05,940
Poirot returned to his own compartment 
to get cigarettes from his suitcase.

1653
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:12,000
As he opened the case, he 
sat down suddenly and stared.

1654
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:20,160
Placed tidily among his things was a red 
dressing gown with a Chinese picture on the back.

1655
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:24,780
CHAPTER SEVEN

1656
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:27,180
Which of Them?

1657
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:35,220
M. Bouc and Dr Constantine were talking together 
when Poirot entered the restaurant carriage.

1658
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:42,000
'Well,' said M. Bouc, 'this 
case makes no sense at all.'

1659
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:45,920
'I agree,' said the doctor.

1660
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,480
Poirot lit a cigarette.

1661
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:53,760
'But the evidence of the 
passengers was very helpful.'

1662
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:58,260
'I thought it told us nothing!' cried Bouc.

1663
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,700
'What did I miss?'

1664
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,720
'Take young MacQueen, for example.

1665
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:11,100
He told us that his employer, M. Ratchett, 
spoke no languages except English.

1666
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,980
Last night the conductor heard 
someone in M. Ratchett's compartment  

1667
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:25,615
call out, "Ce n'est rien.Je me suis 
from pc." That was not M. Ratchett.'

1668
02:10:25,615 --> 02:10:29,460
'It is true!' cried Constantine excitedly.

1669
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:33,960
'That is why you didn't want to 
accept the evidence of the watch.

1670
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:39,720
Those words came from the compartment 
at twenty-three minutes to one.

1671
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:43,860
Ratchett was already dead -'

1672
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:48,840
'And it was his murderer 
speaking,' finished M. Bouc.

1673
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,120
'You go too fast, my friends,' said Poirot.

1674
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:59,160
'We have no evidence that 
Ratchett was dead at that time.'

1675
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,400
'There was the cry that woke you.'

1676
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,040
'Yes, that is true.'

1677
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:12,300
'In one way,' said M. Bouc, 'this 
discovery does not change things very much.

1678
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:18,600
The murderer killed Ratchett half an 
hour earlier than we first thought.

1679
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:22,500
He stayed in the compartment for half an hour,  

1680
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:30,360
changed the watch hands to a quarter past one 
and left through Mrs Hubbard's compartment.'

1681
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:37,740
'But imagine that you are 
the murderer,' said Poirot.

1682
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:45,300
'Wouldn't you change the watch to a time when your 
presence in Ratchett's compartment was impossible?  

1683
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:51,600
You wouldn't move the hands to the exact 
time that you left the crime scene.'

1684
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:57,360
'True,' said Dr Constantine, a little confused.

1685
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:04,440
'Perhaps it was the second murderer 
who changed the watch,' said M. Bouc.

1686
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:07,380
'The woman in the red dressing gown.'

1687
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:15,720
'It was too dark for her to see that the man 
was already dead, but she managed to find a  

1688
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:23,640
watch in Ratchett's pyjama pocket and change 
the time blindly!' said Poirot in disbelief.

1689
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,600
M. Bouc gave him a cold stare.

1690
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:31,980
'And what is your explanation, my friend?'

1691
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:39,540
'At the moment I have none that 
makes sense,' replied Poirot.

1692
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:45,240
'But it is time to close our eyes and think.

1693
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:50,100
One or more of the passengers killed Ratchett.

1694
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:52,680
Which of them?'

1695
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:58,140
For a quarter of an hour, no one spoke.

1696
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:01,020
Poirot appeared to be asleep.

1697
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:06,960
Then suddenly his eyes opened 
and he said to himself,  

1698
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:16,380
'But why not? If so - well, 
that would explain everything.'

1699
02:13:20,580 --> 02:13:27,420
He turned to the other men in the carriage 
and asked, 'Have you had any useful thoughts?'

1700
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,660
'Thoughts, yes, but nothing 
very useful,' said the doctor.

1701
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:35,700
M. Bouc agreed.

1702
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:43,440
'I myself have thought of an explanation 
that would cover all the facts of the case.

1703
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:50,760
I am not yet sure that it is the 
correct one, but I will soon find out.

1704
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,980
Before that, let us discuss 
some points of interest.

1705
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:01,500
Firstly, an ink spot on a Hungarian passport.'

1706
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:07,500
M. Bouc looked at the passport 
of Count and Countess Andrenyi.

1707
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:12,000
'Is this the spot that you mean?' he asked.

1708
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:13,920
'Yes.

1709
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,280
It seems to be fresh ink.

1710
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,740
You notice where it is?'

1711
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:23,280
'At the beginning of the Countess's name.

1712
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:25,260
But what -?'

1713
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,980
'Now, let us think back to the handkerchief.

1714
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:35,460
It is a very expensive thing, hand-made in Paris.

1715
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:44,040
It has an H on it, but it is not something 
that unfashionable Mrs Hubbard would buy,  

1716
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:50,580
and it is certainly not the handkerchief 
of Hildegarde, the lady's maid.

1717
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:57,120
There are only two women on the train 
who might own a handkerchief like this.

1718
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:01,860
They are Princess Dragomiroff -'

1719
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:08,820
'Whose first name is Natalia,' 
interrupted M. Bouc and Countess Andrenyi.

1720
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:13,020
Now, I wonder about that ink spot.

1721
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:20,640
Perhaps it was just an accident, 
but perhaps it is hiding a letter.

1722
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:27,720
Perhaps the Countess's name 
is not Elena but Helena.'

1723
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,760
'Helena!' cried M. Bouc.

1724
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,080
'That is an idea.'

1725
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:38,520
'And there is something to support that idea too.

1726
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:44,040
One of the labels on the Countess's 
luggage was slightly wet.

1727
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:48,900
Perhaps there too a change to her name was made.'

1728
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:54,300
'I am starting to believe you,' said M. Bouc.

1729
02:15:54,960 --> 02:16:01,200
'But the Countess Andrenyi, a 
murderer? It is so unlikely.'

1730
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:08,580
'Now, let us imagine last night 
without the snow on the line.

1731
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:10,560
What happens?

1732
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:16,380
Well, the murder is discovered 
as the train enters Italy.

1733
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:22,800
The man in conductor's uniform is 
seen earlier-just before one o'clock.

1734
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:28,920
We find a button in Mrs Hubbard's 
compartment and the uniform in the toilets.

1735
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:32,819
We read the threatening 
letters produced by MacQueen.

1736
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:41,280
We decide that the murderer got off the 
train at Brod, where it stopped at 00.58.'

1737
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:44,160
'You mean -?'

1738
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:47,460
'I mean that the murder was planned to seem  

1739
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:52,200
like the work of someone from 
the outside, not a passenger.

1740
02:16:52,979 --> 02:16:56,759
But the snow changed everything.

1741
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:03,300
It made it impossible to believe that 
the murderer had got off the train.'

1742
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:07,380
'And where does the handkerchief fit in?'

1743
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:10,500
'Be patient, my friend.

1744
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:18,541
Now, we return to the burnt note which 
included the words Daisy Armstrong.

1745
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:23,040
The murderer did not want us to read that letter.

1746
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:24,899
Why not?

1747
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:28,260
There can be only one reason.

1748
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:34,800
Someone on this train must be very 
closely connected to the Armstrong family,  

1749
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:38,820
and the note would make that person look guilty.

1750
02:17:39,899 --> 02:17:44,280
I think that person is Countess Andrenyi.'

1751
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:51,000
'But what connection could she have 
with the Armstrongs?' cried M. Bouc.

1752
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:54,600
'She says that she has never been to America.'

1753
02:17:56,280 --> 02:18:02,939
'Yes, and she speaks only a little English, 
and she has a very foreign appearance.

1754
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:06,720
But this could all be an act.

1755
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,359
I am guessing that she is 
Linda Arden's younger daughter.

1756
02:18:13,319 --> 02:18:16,920
Arden was not the actress's real surname.

1757
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:21,541
Perhaps she was really called Goldenberg,

1758
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:28,560
and the daughter met and married Count 
Andrenyi while he was working in Washington.'

1759
02:18:29,939 --> 02:18:33,240
'But the Princess says that 
she married an Englishman.'

1760
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:41,099
'Princess Dragomiroff says that she cannot 
remember the name of the daughter's husband.

1761
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:48,420
Is that likely, when the Princess and 
the actress were such close friends?'

1762
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,800
One of the waiters interrupted them.

1763
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:57,661
'Excuse me, Monsieur Bouc, but 
should we serve dinner now?'

1764
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:00,480
M. Bouc looked at Poirot.

1765
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:07,080
'I think dinner would be most 
welcome,' said the detective.

1766
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:14,340
At dinner, Poirot shared a table 
with M. Bouc and the doctor.

1767
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,440
The other passengers spoke 
little - even Mrs Hubbard.

1768
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:24,000
Poirot heard her say, 'I don't think I can eat,'  

1769
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:28,140
then watched as she ate everything 
that was offered to her.

1770
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:34,440
Poirot had asked the waiter to serve 
the Count and Countess Andrenyi last.

1771
02:19:35,819 --> 02:19:38,759
All the other tables were empty 
when they finished their meal.

1772
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,080
As they stood up, Poirot stepped towards them.

1773
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:47,220
'You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame,'  

1774
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:51,840
he said, passing the Countess 
the small square of material.

1775
02:19:53,399 --> 02:19:56,580
She looked at it quickly, 
then gave it back to him.

1776
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,400
'You are mistaken, Monsieur.

1777
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:01,200
That is not my handkerchief.'

1778
02:20:02,819 --> 02:20:07,979
'But it has a letter H on it - 
the first letter of your name.'

1779
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:13,980
She said calmly, 'My name is Elena.

1780
02:20:13,979 --> 02:20:15,719
The first letter is E.'

1781
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:20,700
'1 think not,' said Poirot.

1782
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:24,720
'Your name is Helena, not Elena.

1783
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:30,720
You are Helena Goldenberg, 
the sister of Mrs Armstrong.'

1784
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:35,879
There was complete silence for a minute or two.

1785
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:39,980
Both the Count and the Countess had gone white.

1786
02:20:39,979 --> 02:20:45,899
Poirot said, more gently, 'You cannot deny it.

1787
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:47,519
We know.'

1788
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:53,700
'It is true, Monsieur,' said the Countess.

1789
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,399
Her voice had changed.

1790
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:58,620
It was, for the first time, American.

1791
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,840
'Why did you not tell me 
that this morning, Madame?  

1792
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:07,980
And why did you change the name on your passport?'

1793
02:21:09,899 --> 02:21:14,160
'I changed the name - it was 
not my wife,' said the Count.

1794
02:21:15,479 --> 02:21:20,939
'We had heard that a handkerchief with an H on it 
had been discovered by the murdered man's body.'

1795
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,380
Helena spoke in an emotional voice.

1796
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:31,020
'The dead man murdered my niece, killed my sister  

1797
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:39,360
and caused the death of my sister's husband - the 
three people that I loved best in all the world.

1798
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,320
I had such a good reason for killing him.'

1799
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:47,700
'And did you kill him, Madame?'

1800
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:51,960
'I promise you that I did not.'

1801
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:54,420
she said quietly.

1802
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:58,080
'It is true,' said the Count.

1803
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:01,920
'Helena never left her compartment last night.'

1804
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:10,080
He paused, then continued, 
'Imagine my position, M. Poirot.

1805
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:15,479
I did not want my wife, who I knew was 
innocent, to be taken to a police station,  

1806
02:22:15,479 --> 02:22:20,759
questioned, perhaps even judged 
guilty and sent to prison.'

1807
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:29,160
'If I am going to believe you, 
you must help me,' said Poirot.

1808
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:32,939
'Help you?' repeated the Countess.

1809
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:34,920
'Yes.

1810
02:22:35,939 --> 02:22:43,740
The reason for the murder lies in the past - 
in the deaths of your sister and her family.

1811
02:22:44,819 --> 02:22:51,780
Take me back into the past so that I can find 
the connection that explains everything.'

1812
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,880
'What can I tell you? They are all dead.

1813
02:22:57,780 --> 02:23:04,500
All dead - Robert, Sonia, dear little Daisy.'

1814
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:06,840
'Susanne too.

1815
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:10,320
What nationality was she, Madame?'

1816
02:23:10,319 --> 02:23:13,679
'Poor Susanne.

1817
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,640
She was French.'

1818
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,280
'Her surname?'

1819
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:24,060
'It's terrible, but I can't remember 
- we all just called her Susanne.

1820
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,939
A pretty, cheerful girl.

1821
02:23:27,899 --> 02:23:29,700
She was so fond of Daisy.

1822
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:32,340
She helped the nurse to look after her.'

1823
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,640
'Who was the nurse?'

1824
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,700
'Stengelberg was her name.

1825
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:40,979
She too loved Daisy.'

1826
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:49,620
'You yourself - you were a young girl 
at the time - did you have a governess?'

1827
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,580
'Oh, yes, a very frightening woman.

1828
02:23:53,580 --> 02:24:00,420
She was English - no, Scottish - a 
big, red-haired lady in her forties.'

1829
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:03,480
'What was her name?'

1830
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:05,820
'Miss Freebody.'

1831
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,319
'And there was no one else living with you?'

1832
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,541
'Only servants.'

1833
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:19,260
'Now, Madame, I want you to think 
carefully before you answer this question.

1834
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:26,760
Have you, since you were on this train, 
seen anyone that you recognised?'

1835
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:29,400
She stared at him.

1836
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:33,300
'I? No, no one.'

1837
02:24:34,859 --> 02:24:37,679
'What about Princess Dragomiroff?'

1838
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:40,500
'Oh, I know her, of course.

1839
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:46,560
I thought you meant anyone - 
anyone from - from that time.'

1840
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:49,081
'I did, Madame.

1841
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:51,840
Some years have passed, remember.

1842
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:56,040
The person may look very different now.'

1843
02:24:58,020 --> 02:24:59,281
She thought for a moment.

1844
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:03,840
'No - I am sure - there is no one.'

1845
02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:15,420
When the Count and Countess had left the carriage, 
M. Bouc cried, 'Excellent work, my friend.

1846
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:18,060
I never for one moment

1847
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:21,241
imagined that the Countess could be our murderer.'

1848
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:28,260
'So you feel sure that she 
is guilty?' asked M. Poirot.

1849
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:30,540
'Yes.

1850
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:35,460
The handkerchief proves it,' 
said M. Bouc confidently.

1851
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:40,200
'Oh, I am not sure about the handkerchief.

1852
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:45,300
There is another person who 
could be its owner, remember.

1853
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:48,179
I -'

1854
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:52,920
He stopped suddenly as Princess Dragomiroff 
entered the restaurant carriage.

1855
02:25:54,120 --> 02:26:01,859
She walked towards Poirot and said, 'I believe, 
Monsieur, that you have a handkerchief of mine.'

1856
02:26:01,859 --> 02:26:09,000
'Is this it, Madame?' He showed her the 
one found in Ratchett's compartment.

1857
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:11,280
'That is it.

1858
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:16,260
It has a letter N in the 
corner, for my name Natalia.'

1859
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:23,460
'But, Madame, it has the 
letter H, not N,' said M. Bouc.

1860
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:26,700
She gave him a cold stare.

1861
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:32,160
'My handkerchiefs always 
have Russian letters on them.

1862
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:36,000
H is N in Russian.'

1863
02:26:37,979 --> 02:26:42,899
There was something about this old lady 
that made M. Bouc feel very foolish.

1864
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:49,860
'You did not tell us that this handkerchief 
was yours when we questioned you this morning,'  

1865
02:26:50,819 --> 02:26:51,420
he said.

1866
02:26:52,859 --> 02:26:55,859
'You did not ask me,' said the Princess.

1867
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:05,160
'Your next question, I suppose, will be - why was 
my handkerchief lying by a murdered man's body?  

1868
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:10,620
My reply to that is that I have no idea.'

1869
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:19,019
'Please excuse me, Madame, but why 
would we believe you?' said Poirot.

1870
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:24,660
'You have already lied to us about 
Mrs Armstrong's younger sister.'

1871
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,200
'And I would do the same again.

1872
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,840
Her mother was my friend.

1873
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:38,940
I believe in loyalty - to friends, 
to family - above all else.'

1874
02:27:40,979 --> 02:27:43,500
'And in the case of the handkerchief,  

1875
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:48,660
perhaps you are again lying to 
protect your friend's daughter.'

1876
02:27:50,819 --> 02:27:56,880
'You think that the handkerchief 
is Helena's?' She smiled coldly.

1877
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:01,439
'Well, it is easy to prove that it is mine.

1878
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:07,200
I will give you the address of the 
people in Paris who made it for me.'

1879
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:14,400
'Your maid, Madame, did she 
recognise this handkerchief  

1880
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:16,620
when we showed it to her this morning?'

1881
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:19,139
'Probably.

1882
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:27,120
She saw it and said nothing? Ah, 
well, then she too can be loyal.'

1883
02:28:28,979 --> 02:28:32,040
She stood up and walked out 
of the restaurant carriage.

1884
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:39,240
'But the Princess cannot be our 
murderer,' said Dr Constantine.

1885
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:43,380
'She doesn't have the strength 
to make the deepest wounds.

1886
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:45,660
Her arms are very weak.'

1887
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:49,139
'But the smaller wounds?'

1888
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:52,860
'Yes, those could be her work, I suppose.'

1889
02:28:52,859 --> 02:28:56,399
M. Bouc shook his head.

1890
02:28:57,300 --> 02:29:00,540
'Lies - and more lies.

1891
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:05,340
I cannot believe how many lies 
we were told this morning!'

1892
02:29:07,319 --> 02:29:12,599
'There are many more lies to 
uncover,' said Poirot cheerfully.

1893
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:17,460
'I just need to make some more lucky guesses.'

1894
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,640
CHAPTER EIGHT

1895
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:25,859
Two Solutions

1896
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:32,160
Colonel Arbuthnot was called 
again to the restaurant carriage.

1897
02:29:32,939 --> 02:29:36,839
He came in, clearly annoyed, and said, 'Well?'

1898
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:42,781
'Firstly, I would like to 
show you a pipe cleaner.'

1899
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:45,480
Poirot held it up.

1900
02:29:46,740 --> 02:29:48,540
'Is it one of yours?'

1901
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:50,760
'I don't know.

1902
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:53,580
I don't put a private mark on them!'

1903
02:29:55,380 --> 02:29:59,160
'You are the only passenger who smokes a pipe.

1904
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:04,560
This pipe cleaner was found by 
the body of the murdered man.

1905
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:09,661
Can you tell us, Colonel, how it got there?'

1906
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,859
Colonel Arbuthnot looked surprised.

1907
02:30:14,939 --> 02:30:17,219
'I don't know,' he said.

1908
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:20,700
'I can only tell you that I 
didn't drop it there myself.'

1909
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:25,380
'Did you murder Mr Ratchett?'

1910
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:28,560
'I never even spoke to the man.

1911
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:33,720
Although, if I was the murderer, 
I wouldn't tell you, would I?'

1912
02:30:35,939 --> 02:30:36,899
'Oh well.

1913
02:30:36,899 --> 02:30:38,280
It doesn't matter.'

1914
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:42,480
Again, the Colonel looked surprised.

1915
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:48,960
'I really wanted to see you about 
something else,' continued Poirot.

1916
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:57,319
'Miss Debenham has told you that I heard her 
talking to you on the platform at Konya?'

1917
02:30:57,319 --> 02:31:00,240
Arbuthnot did not reply.

1918
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:03,900
'She said, "Not now.

1919
02:31:03,899 --> 02:31:05,639
When it's all over.

1920
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:12,180
When it's behind us." Do you 
know what those words meant?'

1921
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,080
'I must refuse to answer that question.'

1922
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:20,759
'You will not tell a lady's secrets?'

1923
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:22,620
'Exactly.'

1924
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:28,620
'Even when that lady is likely 
to be guilty of murder?'

1925
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:31,140
'That is crazy.

1926
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:33,720
Miss Debenham is not a murderer.'

1927
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:42,900
'Miss Debenham was the Armstrongs' governess at 
the time that Daisy was kidnapped,' said Poirot.

1928
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:45,780
There was a minute's silence.

1929
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:52,979
'You see, we know more than 
you think,' continued Poirot.

1930
02:31:54,060 --> 02:32:00,420
'If Miss Debenham is innocent, why did she 
say that she had never been to America?'

1931
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:03,899
The Colonel coughed.

1932
02:32:03,899 --> 02:32:06,420
'Perhaps you are mistaken.'

1933
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:09,540
'No, I am not mistaken.

1934
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,200
Why did Miss Debenham lie to me?'

1935
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:16,200
'I suggest that you ask her.

1936
02:32:16,859 --> 02:32:18,599
I still think that you are wrong.'

1937
02:32:19,819 --> 02:32:22,920
Poirot called to one of the waiters.

1938
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:29,700
'Go and ask the English lady in 
number 11 to come here, please.'

1939
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:36,420
The four men sat in silence until Miss 
Debenham had entered the carriage.

1940
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:39,960
Her head was thrown back bravely.

1941
02:32:40,859 --> 02:32:42,299
She looked very beautiful.

1942
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:48,121
Her eyes went to Arbuthnot 
for a moment - just a moment.

1943
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:52,979
Then she said to Poirot, 'You wished to see me?'

1944
02:32:54,600 --> 02:33:01,020
'I wished to ask you, Mademoiselle, why you 
told us that you had never been in America.

1945
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:07,741
We now know that you were living in the 
Armstrongs' house when Daisy was kidnapped.'

1946
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:14,520
Her face changed for a second, 
then returned to its usual calm.

1947
02:33:16,439 --> 02:33:21,120
'The reason for my lie is easy to 
explain,' she said with a smile.

1948
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:23,460
'I have to work.

1949
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:29,280
Do you know how hard it is to get 
and keep a good job as a governess?

1950
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:36,360
If my name were connected with this crime, if 
my photograph were in the English newspapers,  

1951
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:39,240
my reputation would be ruined.

1952
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,399
I would never work again.'

1953
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:46,980
'But if you were not guilty, 
there would be no problem.'

1954
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:55,560
'People remember names and faces - they do not 
remember who was guilty and who was innocent.'

1955
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:00,359
'It is always better to be honest, Mademoiselle.

1956
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:08,700
And you also kept secret the fact that Countess 
Andrenyi is Mrs Armstrong's younger sister.'

1957
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:15,899
'Countess Andrenyi? Really?' She shook her head.

1958
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:21,420
'It may seem unlikely, but I 
honestly didn't recognise her.

1959
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:27,300
Three years ago, when I last saw 
her, she was an American schoolgirl.

1960
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:30,059
She looks so different!

1961
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:36,000
It is true that, when I saw 
her, her face looked familiar.

1962
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:38,340
But I couldn't think who she was.

1963
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:42,059
After that, I didn't really notice her.

1964
02:34:42,899 --> 02:34:44,280
I had my own worries.'

1965
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:51,120
'You will not tell me your 
secret?' asked Poirot gently.

1966
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:58,980
She replied very quietly, 'I can't - I can't.'

1967
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:04,741
Suddenly her face was in her 
hands and she was crying.

1968
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,200
She seemed heartbroken.

1969
02:35:08,939 --> 02:35:12,179
The Colonel jumped up and 
stood uncomfortably beside her.

1970
02:35:13,319 --> 02:35:17,819
He shouted at Poirot, 'I'll 
break every bone in your body!'

1971
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:21,479
'Monsieur!' cried M. Bouc.

1972
02:35:23,220 --> 02:35:24,840
Arbuthnot was now talking to the girl.

1973
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:28,599
'Mary, please -'

1974
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:30,000
She jumped up.

1975
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:33,000
'It's nothing,' she said.

1976
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:34,440
'I'm fine.

1977
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:38,640
You don't need me any more, do you, M. Poirot?

1978
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:42,720
If you do, please come and find me.

1979
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:46,920
Oh, what a fool I'm making of myself!'

1980
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:52,680
She hurried out of the 
carriage, followed by Arbuthnot.

1981
02:35:56,100 --> 02:36:03,241
'Well, my friend,' smiled M. Bouc at 
Poirot, 'another excellent guess!'

1982
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:09,720
'How do you do it?' asked Dr 
Constantine in admiration.

1983
02:36:11,819 --> 02:36:13,740
'This time it was easy.

1984
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,600
Countess Andrenyi almost told me.'

1985
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:20,700
'What?!'

1986
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:27,840
'When I asked her governess's 
name, she said Freebody.

1987
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:35,700
You may not know, gentlemen, but there used to 
be a shop in London called Debenham and Freebody.

1988
02:36:36,899 --> 02:36:40,379
With the name Debenham running through her head,  

1989
02:36:40,380 --> 02:36:44,940
Freebody was the first name that 
the Countess could think of.

1990
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:49,140
I understood immediately, of course.'

1991
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,720
'Nothing would surprise me now,' said M. Bouc.

1992
02:36:55,500 --> 02:37:00,899
'Even if everybody on the train proved 
to be friends of the Armstrongs!'

1993
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:05,340
'It is certainly a most surprising case,'  

1994
02:37:06,359 --> 02:37:15,120
said Dr Constantine? 'Now, let us see 
your Italian, M. Bouc,' said Poirot.

1995
02:37:16,140 --> 02:37:19,500
He asked the waiter to call 
Foscarelli to the restaurant carriage.

1996
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,720
The big Italian soon arrived, 
looking very nervous.

1997
02:37:25,979 --> 02:37:28,439
'What do you want?' he said.

1998
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:31,500
'I have told you everything that I know.'

1999
02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:38,281
'But now we want the true story,' said Poirot.

2000
02:37:38,819 --> 02:37:45,599
'We already know it, but it will be 
better for you if you tell us yourself'

2001
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:51,840
'You sound like the American 
police,' he said angrily.

2002
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:57,900
' "Be honest with us," they say, "and 
the judges will be kind to you."'

2003
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:04,500
'Ah! You have had experience 
of the New York police?'

2004
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:07,260
'No, no, never.

2005
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:13,740
They could not prove anything against 
me - although they tried hard enough.'

2006
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:22,620
'That was in the Armstrong case, 
wasn't it?' said Poirot quietly.

2007
02:38:23,460 --> 02:38:30,359
'You drove their cars for them?' 
His eyes met the Italian's.

2008
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:37,080
'If you already know, why 
ask me?' the Italian said.

2009
02:38:38,939 --> 02:38:41,040
'Why did you lie this morning?'

2010
02:38:42,899 --> 02:38:48,780
'For business reasons, and because I do not 
want to be questioned by the Yugoslav police.

2011
02:38:48,780 --> 02:38:51,300
They hate Italians.

2012
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:54,120
They would just throw me in prison.'

2013
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:59,160
'Perhaps you deserve to be thrown in prison.'

2014
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:04,319
'No, no, I didn't murder that man.

2015
02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:07,799
The long-faced Englishman can tell you that.'

2016
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:11,580
'Very good,' said Poirot.

2017
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:13,201
'You can go.'

2018
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:20,460
'That man was a pig!' cried 
Foscarelli as he left the carriage.

2019
02:39:21,540 --> 02:39:23,160
There were tears in his eyes.

2020
02:39:24,300 --> 02:39:30,840
'Little Daisy - what a lovely 
child! She loved to play in my car.

2021
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:34,620
All the servants thought she was wonderful.'

2022
02:39:37,859 --> 02:39:40,319
Next Poirot called Greta Ohlsson.

2023
02:39:41,399 --> 02:39:46,319
She soon arrived, in tears, and fell 
back into the seat facing the detective.

2024
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:53,040
'Do not upset yourself, 
Mademoiselle,' Poirot said gently.

2025
02:39:54,899 --> 02:39:58,920
'You were the nurse who looked 
after little Daisy Armstrong?'

2026
02:40:01,319 --> 02:40:04,559
'It is true,' cried the unhappy woman.

2027
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:10,260
'Ah, she was a sweet, kind-hearted little girl.'

2028
02:40:11,819 --> 02:40:13,319
For a moment she could not continue.

2029
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:22,260
'I was wrong not to tell you this 
morning, but I was afraid - afraid.

2030
02:40:23,399 --> 02:40:30,479
I was so happy that the evil man was dead, that 
he could not kill any more little children.'

2031
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:35,639
Poirot touched her gently on the shoulder.

2032
02:40:36,779 --> 02:40:41,939
'I understand - I understand everything.

2033
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:46,319
I will ask you no more questions.'

2034
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:54,660
The Swedish lady moved slowly out of 
the carriage, her eyes blind with tears.

2035
02:40:56,279 --> 02:40:59,939
As she reached the door, she 
walked into a man coming in.

2036
02:41:00,779 --> 02:41:03,059
It was the manservant, Masterman.

2037
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:10,200
'Excuse me, sir,' he said to Poirot 
in his usual, unemotional voice.

2038
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:13,260
'I thought I should tell you immediately.

2039
02:41:13,979 --> 02:41:18,719
I worked for Colonel Armstrong in the 
war, sir, and afterwards in New York.

2040
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:21,899
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier.'

2041
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:24,359
He stopped.

2042
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,000
Poirot stared at him.

2043
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:31,140
'Is that all that you want to say?'

2044
02:41:32,580 --> 02:41:33,300
'Yes, sir.'

2045
02:41:34,439 --> 02:41:40,439
He paused; then, when Poirot did not 
speak, he turned and left the carriage.

2046
02:41:42,779 --> 02:41:48,240
'This is more unlikely than a murder 
mystery novel!' cried Dr Constantine.

2047
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:50,760
M. Bouc agreed.

2048
02:41:51,779 --> 02:41:57,719
'Of the twelve passengers, nine have got a 
definite connection with the Armstrong case.'

2049
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:06,360
'Perhaps we can fit them all into our 
little collection,' said Poirot, smiling.

2050
02:42:07,380 --> 02:42:14,700
'Maybe they are - I don't know-the 
Armstrongs' gardener, housekeeper and cook.'

2051
02:42:16,439 --> 02:42:19,740
'That would be too much to believe,' said M. Bouc.

2052
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:22,621
'They cannot all be connected.'

2053
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:25,380
Poirot looked at him.

2054
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:30,240
'You do not understand,' he said.

2055
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:34,380
'You do not understand at all.'

2056
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:38,640
'Do you?' asked M. Bouc.

2057
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:42,059
'Do you know who killed Ratchett?'

2058
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:46,200
'Oh, yes,' Poirot said.

2059
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,500
'I have known for some time.'

2060
02:42:51,899 --> 02:42:53,519
Poirot was silent for a minute.

2061
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:58,860
Then he said, 'M. Bouc, could

2062
02:42:58,859 --> 02:43:00,979
you please call everyone here.

2063
02:43:00,979 --> 02:43:05,580
There are two possible solutions to this case.

2064
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,599
I want to explain them both to you all.'

2065
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:18,600
The passengers crowded into the restaurant 
carriage and took their seats at the tables.

2066
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:21,121
They all looked nervous.

2067
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:26,460
The conductor, Michel, asked 
M. Poirot if he could stay.

2068
02:43:27,899 --> 02:43:31,500
'Of course, Michel,' the detective replied.

2069
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:35,519
He stood up and gave a little cough.

2070
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:43,741
'Ladies and gentlemen, we are 
here to find out who murdered  

2071
02:43:43,740 --> 02:43:49,439
Samuel Edward Ratchett - also known as Cassetti.

2072
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:53,759
There are two possible solutions to the crime.

2073
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,540
I will explain both solutions,  

2074
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:05,220
and ask M. Bouc and Dr Constantine 
here to judge which is the right one.

2075
02:44:07,319 --> 02:44:12,120
'Mr Ratchett died last night between 
midnight and two in the morning.

2076
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:19,260
At half an hour after midnight, the 
train stopped because of the thick snow.

2077
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:25,440
After that time it was impossible 
for anyone to leave the train.

2078
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:29,460
'Here is my first solution.

2079
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:35,279
An enemy of Mr Ratchett got 
onto the train at Belgrade.

2080
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:41,399
He was wearing a conductor's 
uniform and had a conductor's key,  

2081
02:44:41,399 --> 02:44:44,639
with which he opened Ratchett's locked door.

2082
02:44:45,420 --> 02:44:49,380
He attacked Ratchett with a knife and killed him.

2083
02:44:50,460 --> 02:44:54,899
Then he went into Mrs Hubbard's compartment -'

2084
02:44:54,899 --> 02:44:57,359
'That's true,' said Mrs Hubbard.

2085
02:44:58,200 --> 02:45:01,380
'He put his knife in Mrs Hubbard's sponge bag.

2086
02:45:02,279 --> 02:45:06,179
Without knowing it, he lost 
a button from his uniform.

2087
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:10,020
Then he went out into the corridor,  

2088
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:18,360
threw his uniform into a suitcase in an empty 
compartment and, dressed in ordinary clothes,  

2089
02:45:18,359 --> 02:45:24,420
left the train at Vincovci through 
the door near the restaurant car.'

2090
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:29,880
'But that explanation does 
not work!' cried M. Bouc.

2091
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:36,000
'What about the voice heard inside his 
compartment at twenty-three minutes to one?'

2092
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:43,500
'That was not Ratchett and not 
the murderer, but someone else.

2093
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:49,260
Perhaps someone had gone to speak 
to Ratchett and found him dead.

2094
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,500
He rang the bell to tell the conductor.

2095
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:58,920
Then, at the last minute, he changed 
his mind because he was afraid that

2096
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:02,580
people would think he was guilty of the crime.'

2097
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:07,920
Princess Dragomiroff was 
looking at Poirot strangely.

2098
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:16,500
'And the evidence of my maid, who saw the man 
in uniform at a quarter past one?' she asked.

2099
02:46:17,220 --> 02:46:19,440
'How do you explain that?'

2100
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:22,500
'It is simple, Madame.

2101
02:46:23,279 --> 02:46:28,859
She recognised your handkerchief and 
invented her story to protect you.'

2102
02:46:30,899 --> 02:46:34,379
'You have thought of 
everything,' said the Princess.

2103
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:37,740
There was silence.

2104
02:46:38,819 --> 02:46:44,099
Then everyone jumped as Dr Constantine 
suddenly hit the table with his hand.

2105
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:46,920
'But no,' he said.

2106
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:55,440
'No, no, and again no! That explanation 
does not work for so many reasons.

2107
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:58,979
You must know that perfectly well, Poirot.'

2108
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:06,240
'Then I must give my second 
solution,' said the detective.

2109
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:11,520
'But do not forget this first one too quickly.

2110
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:14,280
You may agree with it later.'

2111
02:47:18,479 --> 02:47:21,359
Poirot looked around the 
carriage before continuing,  

2112
02:47:22,859 --> 02:47:28,200
'It was immediately clear to 
me that many of you were lying.

2113
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:34,319
To protect someone, Mr Hardman, 
you should spend the night in  

2114
02:47:34,319 --> 02:47:39,599
the person's compartment or in a 
place where you can see his door.

2115
02:47:40,439 --> 02:47:47,160
Your method was completely useless 
- except for producing evidence  

2116
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:52,979
that no one in any other part of the 
train could be Ratchett's murderer.

2117
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:59,880
'Then there were Miss Debenham 
and Colonel Arbuthnot.

2118
02:48:01,319 --> 02:48:05,460
On the platform at Konya, he called her Mary.

2119
02:48:06,479 --> 02:48:12,359
A man like the Colonel does not use a woman's 
first name when he has only just met her.

2120
02:48:13,080 --> 02:48:16,680
Clearly they were lying about their relationship.

2121
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:21,360
'Mrs Hubbard also made a mistake.

2122
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:26,460
She said that her sponge bag 
was hanging on the handle of  

2123
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:31,500
the door to Ratchett's compartment, 
and that it hid the bolt on the door.

2124
02:48:32,580 --> 02:48:37,380
That would be possible in 
compartments 2, 4 and 12,  

2125
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:44,700
for example - all the even numbers - because 
the bolt is just under the door handle.

2126
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:49,320
But in her compartment, number 3,  

2127
02:48:49,979 --> 02:48:58,439
the bolt is a long way above the handle and so 
it could not be hidden by a hanging sponge bag.

2128
02:48:59,819 --> 02:49:03,599
Mrs Hubbard had clearly invented that story.

2129
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:09,600
'The watch in Ratchett's 
pyjamas was interesting too.

2130
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:13,920
What an uncomfortable place to keep a watch!

2131
02:49:14,939 --> 02:49:17,519
I was sure that it was a false clue.

2132
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:23,580
So was Ratchett murdered earlier, 
when a cry came from his room?

2133
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:25,799
I think not.

2134
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:30,720
He was so heavily drugged that 
he could not defend himself.

2135
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:33,420
He could not cry out either.

2136
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:38,939
I believe that the cry at twenty-three minutes to  

2137
02:49:38,939 --> 02:49:44,099
one - and the words in French 
- were planned to confuse me.

2138
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:49,680
MacQueen told me that Ratchett spoke no French.

2139
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:55,260
I was meant to think that Ratchett 
was killed at that moment.

2140
02:49:56,939 --> 02:50:04,439
'And the real time of the crime? I think 
Ratchett was killed at almost two o'clock.

2141
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:07,380
And the murderer?'  

2142
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,520
He paused, looking at the passengers.

2143
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:17,040
There was complete silence.

2144
02:50:18,540 --> 02:50:19,979
He continued slowly.

2145
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:27,540
'Everyone was proved innocent by 
another passenger - in most cases,  

2146
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:32,640
a passenger who was unlikely to 
be a friend in an earlier life.

2147
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:38,760
MacQueen and Arbuthnot, the 
English manservant and the Italian,  

2148
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:42,899
the Swedish lady and the English governess.

2149
02:50:44,939 --> 02:50:48,359
"This is very strange," I said to myself.

2150
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:52,260
"They cannot all be guilty."

2151
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:58,920
'And then, ladies and gentlemen, I realised.

2152
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:02,700
They were all guilty.

2153
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:07,800
It was impossible that so 
many people connected with  

2154
02:51:07,800 --> 02:51:12,180
the Armstrongs were travelling 
on the same train by chance.

2155
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:17,279
It could only happen if it was planned.

2156
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:24,360
That would also explain the crowded train 
at a time of year that is usually quiet.

2157
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:30,359
There were twelve passengers, 
after Ratchett's death.

2158
02:51:31,380 --> 02:51:34,859
There were twelve knife wounds in Ratchett's body.

2159
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:43,080
In America, murder cases are decided 
by a group of twelve ordinary people.

2160
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:48,600
'Ratchett had escaped punishment 
from the court in America,  

2161
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:52,860
although no one doubted that he was guilty.

2162
02:51:54,240 --> 02:52:00,840
I imagined a group of twelve people who 
decided, when the court case failed,  

2163
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:04,620
to give him his punishment another way.

2164
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:11,220
And immediately the whole case became clear to me.

2165
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:17,880
'Everything was explained - the 
strange wounds that did not bleed,  

2166
02:52:18,540 --> 02:52:21,720
the false threatening letters 
that were written only

2167
02:52:21,720 --> 02:52:28,320
to be produced as evidence, the description 
of the dark man with a high voice that  

2168
02:52:28,319 --> 02:52:34,259
fitted none of the real conductors and 
could equally mean a man or a woman.

2169
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:43,020
I believe that everyone entered Ratchett's 
compartment through Mrs Hubbard's - and  

2170
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:49,680
struck! No one could know which 
strike actually killed him.

2171
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:55,560
'Every detail of the evidence 
was very carefully planned.

2172
02:52:56,700 --> 02:52:59,580
The only possible solution appeared to be  

2173
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:04,559
a murderer who joined the train 
and left again during the night.

2174
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:12,960
But then there was the snow - 
the first piece of bad luck.

2175
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:21,300
I imagine that there was a quick discussion, 
and everyone decided to continue with the crime.

2176
02:53:22,740 --> 02:53:28,080
It would be clear that the murderer had 
to be one or more of the passengers,  

2177
02:53:28,740 --> 02:53:33,120
but they were still protected 
by each other's stories.

2178
02:53:34,740 --> 02:53:42,059
They added some extra clues to confuse the 
case - a pipe cleaner, a lady's handkerchief,  

2179
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:45,480
a woman in a red dressing gown.

2180
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:50,880
The dressing gown was 
probably Countess Andrenyi's,  

2181
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:53,760
as there is no dressing gown in her luggage.

2182
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:59,100
'MacQueen learnt that we had 
seen the word Armstrong on

2183
02:53:59,100 --> 02:54:02,161
the burnt letter, and told the others.

2184
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:05,760
It was their second piece of bad luck.

2185
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:14,040
The position of Countess Andrenyi became worrying, 
and the Count changed her name on the passport.

2186
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:20,400
'The plan was impossible without 
the help of Michel, the conductor.

2187
02:54:21,479 --> 02:54:28,200
But if he was one of the group, then 
there were thirteen people, not twelve.

2188
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:34,140
I believe that the Countess, who had 
the strongest reason to kill Cassetti,  

2189
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:37,560
was probably the one who did not do it.

2190
02:54:38,819 --> 02:54:43,259
Her husband has promised me that 
she did not leave her compartment.

2191
02:54:44,279 --> 02:54:45,300
I believe him.

2192
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:55,260
'But why was honest Michel in this? He was a good 
man who had worked on the train for many years.

2193
02:54:56,580 --> 02:55:02,819
Then I remembered Susanne, 
the Armstrongs' French maid.

2194
02:55:04,439 --> 02:55:08,219
Perhaps the unlucky girl was Michel's daughter.

2195
02:55:09,899 --> 02:55:15,299
And the others? Arbuthnot was probably 
an army friend of Armstrong's,  

2196
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:18,360
Hildegarde Schmidt the family's cook.

2197
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:26,340
Hardman probably worked as a detective on the 
case, or perhaps he had been in love with Susanne.

2198
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:30,960
And then there was Mrs Hubbard.

2199
02:55:32,279 --> 02:55:36,059
She had a difficult job, because she was in the  

2200
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:39,960
compartment through which 
everyone reached Ratchett.

2201
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:43,680
No one could say that they were with her.

2202
02:55:44,819 --> 02:55:54,660
To play the part of this foolish old woman, a 
true actress was needed - Mrs Armstrong's mother,  

2203
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:57,179
Linda Arden.'

2204
02:56:01,319 --> 02:56:02,099
He stopped.

2205
02:56:03,240 --> 02:56:09,240
Then, in a soft rich dreamy voice, very 
unlike the one she had used on the journey,  

2206
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:14,760
Mrs Hubbard said, 'I always 
liked playing amusing characters.

2207
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:18,480
That mistake with the sponge 
bag was silly, though.

2208
02:56:19,319 --> 02:56:25,139
We tried it on the journey east, but I was in 
an even numbered compartment then, I suppose.'

2209
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:32,099
She moved slightly and looked straight at Poirot.

2210
02:56:33,479 --> 02:56:36,240
'You have guessed so much, M. Poirot.

2211
02:56:37,080 --> 02:56:42,359
But even you can't imagine what it 
was like - that terrible day in New  

2212
02:56:42,359 --> 02:56:47,160
York when Hector MacQueen told us that 
Cassetti had walked free from the court.

2213
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:54,840
I was crazy with sadness and 
anger - and the servants were too.

2214
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:58,080
Colonel Arbuthnot was there.

2215
02:56:58,979 --> 02:57:01,679
He was Robert Armstrong's best friend.'

2216
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:06,939
'He saved my life in the war,' said Arbuthnot.

2217
02:57:07,859 --> 02:57:10,740
'We decided then and there 
to give him the punishment  

2218
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:14,279
that the court had failed to give him - death.

2219
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:17,760
Perhaps we were mad

2220
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,140
I don't know.

2221
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:27,180
There were twelve of us - well, eleven, because 
Susanne's father was in France, of course.

2222
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:31,140
Mary planned all the details with Hector.

2223
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:35,220
'It took a long time to perfect our plan.

2224
02:57:36,479 --> 02:57:38,519
Hardman managed to find Ratchett.

2225
02:57:39,060 --> 02:57:42,360
Then Masterman and Hector 
had to get jobs with him.

2226
02:57:43,560 --> 02:57:45,780
We had a meeting with Susanne's father.

2227
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:50,520
For Colonel Arbuthnot, it was important that there  

2228
02:57:50,520 --> 02:57:55,020
were twelve of us - it made 
it more correct, he thought.

2229
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:57,900
Michel was willing.

2230
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:02,580
We knew that Ratchett would come back 
from the East on the Orient Express,  

2231
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:05,640
so this seemed the perfect opportunity.

2232
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:10,260
'We tried to book every 
compartment in the carriage,  

2233
02:58:10,859 --> 02:58:16,319
but unfortunately one had been booked long 
before for someone from the train company.'

2234
02:58:17,939 --> 02:58:19,439
She smiled at M. Bouc.

2235
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:27,300
'Mr Harris, of course, was invented - we 
didn't want a stranger in Hector's compartment.

2236
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:33,779
Then, at the last minute, you came, M. Poirot.'

2237
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:36,541
She stopped.

2238
02:58:37,859 --> 02:58:41,939
'Well,' she said, 'you know everything now.

2239
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:48,899
But what are you going to do about 
it? If someone must be punished,  

2240
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:58,800
can't you blame me and only me for the crime? It's 
unnecessary to bring trouble to all these other  

2241
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:07,720
good people - poor Michel - and Mary and Colonel 
Arbuthnot - they love each other so much -'

2242
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:10,140
Poirot looked at his friend.

2243
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:13,859
'What do you say, M. Bouc?'

2244
02:59:13,859 --> 02:59:25,139
M. Bouc coughed and said, 'In my opinion, the 
first solution was the correct one - definitely.

2245
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:28,920
The murderer left the train at Vincovci.

2246
02:59:30,060 --> 02:59:35,220
I suggest that we give that solution to 
the Yugoslav police when they arrive.

2247
02:59:35,939 --> 02:59:37,620
Do you agree, Doctor?'

2248
02:59:39,180 --> 02:59:42,660
'Certainly I agree,' said Dr Constantine.

2249
02:59:43,800 --> 02:59:49,620
'I think I made some - er - rather silly 
suggestions about the medical evidence.'

2250
02:59:51,899 --> 02:59:57,120
'Then,' said Poirot, 'we have solved the case.

2251
02:59:58,560 --> 03:00:01,081
My work here is done.'
