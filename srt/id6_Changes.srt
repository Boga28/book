1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:10,490
Time: the present Place: Sheffield, England

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,080
Everybody knew about the comet.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,730
It was in all the newspapers.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,970
When it finally passed close to the Earth,
it lit up the sky for three nights.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,730
It was beautiful.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,829
People who were not usually interested in
looking beyond their television screens took

7
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,610
at least one look outside.

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,850
Even people like Darren.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,789
Darren was looking in the bathroom mirror
at the spots on his face.

10
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,871
They were near his nose.

11
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:48,920
His mum always said he got spots because he
ate too many sweets.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,039
But he hated sweets.

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,679
And he never ate chocolate.

14
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,360
His mum loved chocolate and she never got
spots.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,760
It wasn't fair.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,010
Darren was just going to examine his biggest
spot when his mum called out.

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,010
'Darren!

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,230
Darren, look at this!'

19
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,920
'Aw, Mum.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,610
I'm busy!'

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,180
But Darren's mum refused to take no for an
answer.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,720
She knew her thirteen-year-old son liked science
fiction.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,930
A bit of science fact would do him no harm.

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,450
This sort of thing didn't happen every day,
after all.

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,140
They said that this comet was only going to
pass the Earth once.

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,470
She didn't want Darren to miss it.

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,300
'Darren Miller, come down right now!'

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,850
When Darren got downstairs, the door to the
garden was open.

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,040
He could see both his parents outside.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,360
They were looking up, their faces lit by a
gentle light.

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
He went out and stood next to them.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,160
Then he, too, looked up.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,440
It was, indeed, a lovely thing to see.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Darren was pleased his mum had called him.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
The sky was full of beautiful, coloured light.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,840
It made Darren think of Christmas lights and
all the bright colours he loved when he was

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,480
younger.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,190
It was so beautiful that he almost forgot
about his spots.

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,510
The next day all of the newspapers were full
of pictures and stories about the comet.

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,310
Some of the newspapers were quite excited
about it, because the comet had passed very

41
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,920
close to the Earth.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,580
'Comet nearly hits Earth!' said one headline
in a newspaper.

43
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,819
'Earth escapes comet!' said another.

44
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,910
Most of the newspaper reports also mentioned
the beauty of the comet.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,300
They all said how lucky we were to see such
a wonderful thing.

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,480
Of course, there were the usual pessimists
who said that the comet would put something

47
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,200
nasty into the air we breathe.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,260
Others said the comet was a sign that the
end of the Earth was coming.

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,360
However, most people took no notice of these
warnings.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,290
Life went on as usual.

51
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,310
Life for Darren meant getting ready for school
again after the holidays.

52
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,580
Comets were nice but now he had more important
things to think about.

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,490
He had to make himself look good for the beautiful
Vanessa.

54
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,599
Darrens school was just an ordinary school
in the city of Sheffield in England.

55
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,100
It was no better than any other school in
Sheffield.

56
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,860
But it did have Vanessa.

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,660
Vanessa was a brown-haired, brown-eyed girl
in the same year as Darren.

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,610
She had smiled at Darren once.

59
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,120
He remembered it well.

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,880
It had happened in the last week before the
holidays.

61
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,349
He had let her go in front of him in the queue
for lunch.

62
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:06,739
She hadn't said 'thank you,' but she had given
him a little smile.

63
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,800
It had showed her perfect white teeth.

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,720
He had been too nervous to speak to her.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
He just couldn't do it.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,579
It would be easier, he felt, to grow wings
and fly up to the ceiling.

67
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,259
This time he would be ready.

68
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,319
He would put on lots of deodorant to make
himself smell nice.

69
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,740
He wanted to have another look at his spots
and, just maybe, have a shave.

70
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,960
The night before he had felt something above
his mouth that might be the first hairs of

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,990
a moustache.

72
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,219
He made sure he got to the bathroom before
everyone else that morning.

73
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:52,080
He wanted to have a close look at those spots...
and his new moustache.

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,389
'Darren, will you be in there for a long time?'

75
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,559
It was Darren's mum.

76
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:02,960
'Your father wants to use the bathroom.'

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,600
Darren knew his dad always spent ages in the
bathroom.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,939
Well, his dad could wait today, for a change.

79
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,840
'I'll be out soon, Mum,' said Darren.

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,349
But he was lying.

81
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,370
He wanted to look good and smell good.

82
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,529
It could take a long time.

83
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,960
His new deodorant smelled very good this morning.

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,039
He suddenly noticed all the different smells
that went into it.

85
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,910
There were flowers, spices - lots of things
he had never smelled before.

86
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,210
His nose felt a bit wet too.

87
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,470
Was he getting a cold?

88
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,180
Probably not, if he could smell things so
well.

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,789
Darren walked over to the mirror and looked
at his face.

90
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,360
His face looked worse than ever!

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,509
His nose was wet and shiny.

92
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,029
It was moving a lot, like an animal's nose.

93
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,819
It looked like a rabbit smelling its breakfast.

94
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,810
But this wasn't the most shocking thing.

95
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,339
His top lip had long, thick hairs on it.

96
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,270
They were like the hairs on an animal's nose.

97
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,090
They were like the whiskers of a rabbit!

98
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,930
Darren screamed.

99
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,569
Time: the present Place: Singapore

100
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:30,639
Julie Ong had been fourteen for three weeks.

101
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,529
A lot of her friends were fourteen too.

102
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,689
They all agreed that a young woman should
watch her weight.

103
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:44,569
It was especially important not to eat sweets
and cakes.

104
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,089
Julie hadn't eaten a cake or a piece of chocolate
since her birthday.

105
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:54,199
But there were still no signs that her parents
saw Julie as a young woman.

106
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,219
To them, she was still a child.

107
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,039
Then there was the strange thing with the
comet.

108
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,159
Everybody was talking about it.

109
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,389
Julies English teacher gave her class homework
about it.

110
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,360
They had to describe the comet in a poem.

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,899
It was so unfair!

112
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:20,009
The comet had been quite beautiful, but writing
about it was no fun at all.

113
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,100
Julie decided to take a break from her Sunday
morning homework.

114
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,819
Instead of writing she would comb her long
black hair in the mirror.

115
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,069
It was more interesting than writing a poem,
at least.

116
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:38,249
Her parents wouldn't notice that she was wasting
time.

117
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,089
She could hear them at the other end of the
house talking about the comet.

118
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,580
They weren't talking loudly, but she could
still hear them.

119
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,809
Her hearing wasn't normally that good.

120
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:51,759
It was very odd.

121
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,219
Julie picked up her hairbrush - her favourite
pink one - and walked towards her bedroom

122
00:07:58,219 --> 00:07:59,219
mirror.

123
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:04,469
But when she looked at herself, she immediately
noticed something strange.

124
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:10,800
There were two things rising up and out from
her hair.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
They were on both sides of her head.

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,960
Julie pushed back her hair and saw that the
two things were her ears.

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:29,949
They were now pointed at the top, like an
animal's ears, and they were bigger too.

128
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,419
Much bigger.

129
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,899
Julie fainted.

130
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,440
Darrens new whiskers grew even longer over
the next week.

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,419
His nose became much, much better at smelling
things too.

132
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,930
He could smell almost anything from a long
distance away now.

133
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,069
His dad had his own smell, so had his mum.

134
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:54,920
Everybody had their own smell.

135
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,510
Having a good nose was useful and Darren liked
it.

136
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,460
He liked his whiskers too, and he couldn't
really shave them off.

137
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,029
It would hurt, he was sure, if he tried.

138
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,180
Anyway, he was getting used to them.

139
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:19,610
In Singapore, Julie Ong discovered that her
hearing had become extremely good.

140
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,410
She could hear almost everything.

141
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,800
Darren didn't know it yet, but the beautiful
Vanessa had now grown long teeth like a cat's.

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,990
She had whiskers too.

143
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,230
And suddenly she seemed to enjoy eating a
lot of fish.

144
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,069
Darren, Julie and Vanessa were not alone.

145
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:46,370
Sudden changes were happening all over the
world.

146
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,529
Many young people between the ages of twelve
and eighteen had developed the special strength

147
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,110
of some kind of animal.

148
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,340
Sometimes it wasn't immediately obvious - like
having the fantastic eyesight of a hunting

149
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
bird.

150
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,310
But often the changes were obvious.

151
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,620
Some had grown long tails and they could hold
on to things with them.

152
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,830
Some had webbed skin on their hands and feet
so that they could swim fast.

153
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:24,829
Some had the strength of a bull; others could
run as fast as a horse.

154
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:30,360
They all looked human still, but in some way
they had changed.

155
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,170
Of course, adults everywhere were extremely
worried.

156
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,790
Why had their children changed?

157
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,290
What had produced the changes?

158
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,180
What could they do to help their children?

159
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,550
Darren discovered that his amazing nose had
many advantages too.

160
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,960
He found that he could tell what mood people
were in just by their smell - even if they

161
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,950
were trying to hide it.

162
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,529
That was useful.

163
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,290
This new sense of smell was useful in other
ways too.

164
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,339
If he lost something, he could always find
it by using his nose.

165
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:15,770
He helped his mum buy the freshest and tastiest
food in the supermarket.

166
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,300
He now used deodorant which didn't have a
strong smell.

167
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,820
His new nose didn't like strong smells any
more.

168
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,360
'You'd better not get too used to it,' said
his dad.

169
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,550
'Some day soon we'll be able to get you back
the way you were.'

170
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,810
'Maybe, Dad,' Darren said.

171
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,720
'But what if I don't want to go back to the
way I was?'

172
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,660
Darrens father didn't say anything.

173
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,740
Like many other parents, he didn't understand
how his son could like the changes.

174
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,259
He wanted the old Darren back - the Darren
without the whiskers and the amazing sense

175
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,240
of smell.

176
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,680
And why had some young people changed while
others hadn't?

177
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,730
That was the question every adult in the world
was asking.

178
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,509
Some adults blamed the children themselves
for the changes.

179
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,899
They said they watched too much TV or ate
the wrong things or didn't behave in the right

180
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,920
way.

181
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,129
Most people blamed the comet.

182
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:23,260
'Comet causes horrible teenage changes!'

183
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,199
was the kind of headline found on the front
page of many newspapers.

184
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,540
They all had similar stories.

185
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,120
Everybody was saying that it must have been
the comet - what else could it have been?

186
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,089
The comet had, in some strange way, affected
the bodies of some teenagers.

187
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:48,459
'I don't think the changes are horrible!'
said Julie to her friends.

188
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:52,060
'I think my new hearing is very useful.

189
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,519
I think my ears are rather beautiful too!'

190
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,540
Some of Julie's friends agreed with her.

191
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,720
'I like my new wings,' said one.

192
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,209
'I can change colour like a chameleon - isn't
that cool?' said another.

193
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:14,470
Teenagers everywhere were comparing their
changes.

194
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,269
Some were stronger, others were faster, others
could jump higher.

195
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:25,980
But no matter what changes happened, they
were still teenagers.

196
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,130
But then something strange happened.

197
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,110
Some teenagers began to return to normal.

198
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,880
Some eventually lost all sign of their changes
and went back to what they had been before.

199
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
But why?

200
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,829
The answer came almost by accident.

201
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:51,470
A teen called Danny was given a job in an
advertisement.

202
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,889
Danny had wings and he could fly.

203
00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:03,250
In the advertisement, Danny had to fly over
a childrens party and give out chocolate biscuits.

204
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,240
Danny hated chocolate biscuits, but he had
to eat some during the advertisement.

205
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,459
It was after he ate his second biscuit that
something started happening.

206
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,480
His wings started to get smaller.

207
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,749
Soon they disappeared completely.

208
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:25,069
He couldn't fly any more.

209
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,629
Danny was a 'normal' teenager again.

210
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:32,089
Why had it happened?

211
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,089
It was the chocolate.

212
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,270
It had to be.

213
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,439
Scientists tested the effect of chocolate
on other teenagers.

214
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:45,040
They discovered that if the teenagers ate
a few things with chocolate in them, they

215
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,259
went back to normal.

216
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,690
The world now knew why some children hadn't
been affected by the comet.

217
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,769
The mystery was solved.

218
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,860
The comet had only changed teenagers who didn't
eat chocolate!

219
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,350
'I don't like chocolate, you know that,' Darren
told his parents.

220
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,850
'I've never liked it.'

221
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:14,220
'But all you have to do is eat a bit and you'll
go back to normal!' said Dad.

222
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,529
'You want to be normal again, don't you, Darren?'

223
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,910
Darren thought about Vanessa.

224
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,209
He liked her new cat looks.

225
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,610
Vanessa had found Darrens changes attractive
too.

226
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,440
She had spoken to him quite a lot lately.

227
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,879
'If you mean do I want to be like most of
my friends, then yes.

228
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,500
But some of my friends have changed and we
like the changes.

229
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,559
Why should I want to go back?

230
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,199
Anyway, I hate chocolate.'

231
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,019
His parents couldn't make him change his mind.

232
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,310
Maybe if his friends agreed to change back,
Darren would too.

233
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,230
But that wasn't as easy as it seemed.

234
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,089
A lot of teenagers felt the same way as Darren.

235
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,790
Some adults accepted their new teenagers because
the changes were useful in daily life.

236
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,939
If you were faster and stronger, for example,
you could work better.

237
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:21,370
But most adults expected that their teenagers
would want to return to how they had been

238
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,370
before.

239
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,350
Many of them did.

240
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,990
But a lot of teenagers simply didn't care
what the adults wanted.

241
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,230
They refused to eat the chocolate.

242
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,809
In Singapore, Julie Ong finally ate some chocolate.

243
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:43,130
Soon, her beautiful big ears were gone.

244
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,220
She often remembered them and was sad.

245
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:53,240
In Sheffield, Darren Miller was using his
nose to enjoy the sweet smell of the carrots

246
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,880
growing in Vanessa's garden.

247
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,970
Vanessa watched him happily as she ate a fish
on top of the garden wall.

248
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,159
- THE END -
