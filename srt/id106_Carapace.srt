1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,740
Some questions are difficult to ask.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,950
So you ask a different question, or you drop
a little hint, and then a bigger hint.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,770
But sometimes people just don't want to hear.

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,830
They have a carapace around them, like the
hard shell of a sea-turtle, and they are deaf

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,760
to your words.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:56,949
The girl in this story has two men in her
life, and a question she must ask...

7
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:59,739
Anura Perera is coming over tonight.

8
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,650
Amma - my mother - says I ought to take him
seriously.

9
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,870
I told Vijay about it.

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,870
'So?'

11
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,400
Vijay said.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,630
'He's coming to see me because he's interested
in me and he has serious marriage intentions.

13
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,450
He lives in Australia!'

14
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,990
Vijay smiled and said nothing.

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,640
That's the way with Vijay.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,850
'Do you know who Anura Perera is?'

17
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,520
I asked him.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
He shook his head.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,020
'No.'

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,140
Then he laughed.

21
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,130
'So he's looking for a Sri Lankan wife?'

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,130
'Yes!'

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,619
I said.

24
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:48,740
'Anura Perera earns dollars, has a Sydney
house, and a ticket to Australia.'

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,920
'So what are you saying?'

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,500
Vijay laughed.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,310
'You are going to marry this fool with a foreign
job?

28
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,590
Is that what you've come to tell me?'

29
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,960
That wasn't what I had come to tell him at
all.

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,409
I first met Vijay at the new disco.

31
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,490
It was a birthday party and there were about
twenty people in our group.

32
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,580
I didn't know many of them.

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,750
My friend Lakshmi took me along to it.

34
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,310
It was her friend's birthday, and we had all
been looking forward to going to this new

35
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,890
place.

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,890
Everyone was talking about it.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,010
It was crowded that night.

38
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,090
The dance floor was fantastic - with lights
coming on underneath and other lights moving

39
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,379
fast around the room.

40
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,980
Vijay was not in our group.

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,950
He came up to me and said, 'How about a dance?'

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,099
It was difficult to hear him, but when the
lights shone on him, I could see in his face

43
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,900
that he really wanted to dance with me.

44
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,070
We danced all night.

45
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,580
He bought me drinks and smoked lots of cigarettes.

46
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,360
In the end he asked whether we could meet
again.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,890
Only the next day I discovered he is the cook
at the Beach Hut.

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,849
He is older than me; tall and long and always
smiling.

49
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,989
He has such lovely thick untidy hair, and
is so thin.

50
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,519
He never eats!

51
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,500
He says he likes to see his food eaten by
other people.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,270
To watch his customers, his friends, grow
fat and happy.

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:35,660
He says there is nothing he likes better than
to cook his prawns in front of the ocean.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,081
His face is big and square, and he always
seems ready to burst into a laugh.

55
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:48,200
And when he does, the whole sea seems to break
into smiling waves.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,830
The beach is so lovely with him.

57
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:58,030
When I went to see him today, he said, 'Hello,'
with a big smile on his face.

58
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,000
'Come and sit down, I won't be long.'

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,950
He had a bowl full of enormous prawns on his
knees.

60
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:15,069
He took off the heads and shells, then carefully
pulled out a thin blue vein that curved round

61
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,549
each prawn like a backbone.

62
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:25,800
'Look at that,' he said, holding the vein
up, 'sea-poison.'

63
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,821
At first I didn't even want to say a single
word about Anura Perera, but Amma says you

64
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:36,310
must always go for the best you can.

65
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,960
And I know Anura Perera will come in a big
modern car, with a stereo and dark glass in

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,720
the windows.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,530
I wanted Vijay to know.

68
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:56,419
When he finished with the prawns, he washed
his hands and poured out some coffee for me.

69
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,650
I wanted to know what he really felt for me.

70
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,350
'What are we going to do?'

71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,350
I asked.

72
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,870
'About what?' he said.

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,690
'About us,' I said.

74
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,600
'What are we going to do?'

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,830
He said, 'There's an American movie on at
the cinema.'

76
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,430
It is so easy for him.

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,150
He doesn't see anything.

78
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,130
There are no problems, no difficulties.

79
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,460
He's not like other guys, always trying to
persuade a girl into something she doesn't

80
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,360
want to do.

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,180
He always says exactly what he thinks.

82
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,139
But I suppose I looked worried, because he
bent forward.

83
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:47,520
'What is it you want to know then?' he asked,
touching my hand.

84
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,889
He has such a light touch.

85
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:57,680
His fingernails are like sea-shells, pale
pink, with little half-moons visible.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,750
When he touches my hand with his fingers,
I feel wonderful and I want to go on like

87
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,940
this for ever, just drinking coffee together
and looking at the sea.

88
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,599
I said, 'We've got to decide what to do.

89
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,099
Going to a movie won't solve anything.'

90
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,260
'But you like the movies,' he said.

91
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:31,240
For months nothing has happened and now suddenly
everything happens: Vijay first, then Anura

92
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,650
Perera.

93
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,509
When Amma talks to me, I see a whole new world.

94
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:38,509
I don't think

95
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,840
Vijay could even imagine it.

96
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,830
He would just laugh.

97
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,430
Amma said we could go and buy a new sari.

98
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,310
Something really nice.

99
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,190
And I saw just the right shoes at Tonio's,
next to the supermarket.

100
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,330
Imagine flying, stopping in Singapore!

101
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:06,860
I can't believe it, but it is what I've dreamed
of all along; something happening, so I can

102
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,350
be someone instead of this crazy feeling that
nothing matters.

103
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:18,160
But then when I go to Vijay, I really don't
know what I want...

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,200
He looked at me and put his head on one side.

105
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,280
'So what matters so much?' he asked.

106
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,160
He lit one of his thin cigarettes and stretched
out on his chair.

107
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,260
His head rested on the back of it; he let
his mouth stay open like a fish.

108
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,979
Sometimes he can be so silly!

109
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,690
But it isn't that simple!

110
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,449
'We can't just stay like this,' I said.

111
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,550
The Beach Hut isn't going to be here for ever.

112
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,930
The wood is already going soft in the sea
air, and the roof will soon fall apart.

113
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:08,080
I looked out of the doorway and watched the
green sandy water of the ocean rising and

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
falling.

115
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,389
'You can't be a beach cook for the rest of
your life,' I said.

116
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,610
'Or is that all you want?

117
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,409
Do you really only want to be a cook all your
life?'

118
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:27,099
I didn't want to hurt him, I just wanted him
to say something.

119
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,449
But he just stared at me.

120
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:36,310
I felt he was seeing me out at sea, floating
across the ocean.

121
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,880
But who is the drifter?

122
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,930
Not me.

123
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:47,580
A crowd of swimmers arrived, looking for beer
and food, so I said, 'I must go, you have

124
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,390
work to do.

125
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,880
Call me as soon as you can, before evening.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,710
It is important.

127
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,790
Call me, please.'

128
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,800
He smiled sweetly.

129
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,470
'OK,' he said.

130
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,890
Then he closed his eyes and breathed in the
last of his cigarette smoke.

131
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,710
At home everyone was busy.

132
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,500
I went to my room and stayed out of the way.

133
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
I wanted to be alone.

134
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,030
Nobody seemed to miss me.

135
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,580
By five o'clock, when I look out, the whole
place has been dusted and tidied up; Auntie

136
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,770
Manel has even brought flowers for that awful
green vase that sits by the telephone.

137
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,070
The house even smells different.

138
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,640
Amma has made sandwiches and little cakes
to put out in her special silver bowl.

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,890
I have never seen the place looking like this.

140
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,940
Amma is so excited and anxious.

141
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,920
She's been rushing round, arranging everything.

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,120
It's no accident that this first meeting is
happening tonight.

143
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,400
The stars must be in the right position today,
and that gives us our best chance of success

144
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,940
- I know she wouldn't take any risks!

145
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,020
I suppose I should stop all the preparations
and ask her, 'Do I have a choice in all of

146
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
this?'

147
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,970
But I don't want to choose.

148
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,120
I hate choosing.

149
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,400
It's all so crazy.

150
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,250
What's in Australia anyway?

151
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,280
Everyone wants to go there, especially when
there's any trouble here.

152
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,680
But what for?

153
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,100
I like the beach here.

154
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,200
I like our road, the purple bougainvillea
flowers climbing over the wall, and that sandy

155
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,250
path we take down to the sea.

156
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,560
I like travelling by yellow three-wheelers.

157
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,650
Just to live in a large house with a view
of Sydney Opera House or something!

158
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,360
What's so great about that?

159
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,590
Vijay would say it's all in the head.

160
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,160
I wish he would think of something.

161
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,000
But Amma would die if she knew about him.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,100
She'd go crazy.

163
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,670
A cook on the beach!

164
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:15,370
What she wants to say is, 'Good evening, Mr
Perera, so pleased to meet you.

165
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:22,370
Do come and take my daughter away; change
her world with your importance - and your

166
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,500
nice fat wallet.

167
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,540
Give her a modern house, a big car, designer
clothes, shoes she can afford to throw away

168
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,320
after every party.

169
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,800
Give her expensive things, and also your lifelong
respect, and all will be well.

170
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,700
She will be good for your business, your position
in society, she will be a priceless jewel

171
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,320
to you.

172
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,680
Just take her, Mr Perera, please take her
to Australia away from here, and don't forget

173
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,380
her mother...'

174
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,340
I waited and waited for Vijay to call.

175
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,680
I didn't know what I wanted him to say, but
I thought he would find something.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,430
He wouldn't let things slip if just a few
words could solve the problem.

177
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,890
Then about an hour ago the telephone rang.

178
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,200
I let it ring for a bit.

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,490
Amma was in the bathroom.

180
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,850
Nobody else answers the telephone in our house.

181
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,640
In the end I picked it up.

182
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,000
I was trembling so much that I almost couldn't
speak.

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,770
'What time can you come out to eat tonight?'

184
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,930
Vijay asked.

185
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,940
'I've made a special dish - fantastic, with
those big prawns!'

186
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,020
I could hear the ocean in the telephone.

187
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,480
I could see him with a big smile on his face,
pulling open his white shirt and rubbing his

188
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,730
bony chest with his long thin fingers.

189
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,570
He would have the lamps lit under the trees.

190
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,390
I said, 'I can't talk, the iron is on.'

191
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,980
I was ironing my green sari, the new one that
Amma bought for me.

192
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,130
'I have to put the phone down,' I said.

193
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,990
I put it down.

194
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,220
He won't ring again.

195
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:46,010
He thinks I know his number by heart: Mount
Lavinia 926979... 926979...

196
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:57,880
- THE END -
