00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,870
CHAPTER ONE
Blood Feuds

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,220
No one who has not felt it can understand
the pain of an exile.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,950
Living in a country that is not your own,
among people who are not your people.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:20,330
Always a foreigner, an outsider, someone who
does not belong.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:28,320
Two families, living in Zimbabwe, but the
country they call home is Malawi, a country

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:46,079
they have not seen for nearly thirty years,
a sad, troubled country...

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,179
Of course my father and Uncle Phala had their
little disagreements.

8
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,210
But they were the usual ones among friends.

9
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,949
Then there were all those moments of loneliness,
of no hope at all, that everyone in exile

10
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:04,629
feels.

11
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,780
But they always survived, because they missed
home so much.

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,980
They never doubted they would return one day.

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:21,720
That was all my father and Uncle Phala dreamed
about: the return to their own country.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,640
They talked about home all the time.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
How they grew up.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,530
The games they used to play.

17
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,740
The schools they went to, the fight for freedom.

18
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,810
'You young ones have no idea what we had to
do to get rid of the British,' Uncle Phala

19
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,930
used to tell us whenever he could.

20
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,700
He was proud of the injury to his leg, which
he said he got in a street battle against

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,090
the government in the 1950s.

22
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,850
And then my father, of course, felt he had
to show us the marks on his back, which he

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,040
got from beatings in prison.

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,720
'I was in prison for a week,' he would say
proudly, 'not like others who only got injured

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,400
in a fight.'

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,370
Over the years his time in prison became a
month, six weeks, then a year.

27
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,099
'Don't listen to him,' Uncle Phala would answer.

28
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,670
'He fell out of a tree.

29
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,069
That's how he got those marks!'

30
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,459
And he would break into a great, deep laugh.

31
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:35,099
'Now I'll tell you how he really got his injury!'

32
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,739
my father would say, also laughing.

33
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,250
And they would go on like this.

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,230
It wasn't just that they liked each other
- it was much more than that.

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,950
They called each other brother.

36
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:56,549
It was twelve years or more before I learned
that Uncle Phala was, in fact, not my real

37
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,569
uncle.

38
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:04,819
He and my father had met in the mining village
in Zimbabwe where I was born and grew up.

39
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:11,709
Their two families lived together in a flat
as big as a matchbox, and my brothers and

40
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:17,540
sisters and I grew up and went to school with
Uncle Phala's children.

41
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,739
When we finished school, I and most of my
brothers became miners and lived in the mining

42
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,299
village.

43
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:34,040
All through their years in Zimbabwe my father
and Uncle Phala were involved in exile politics.

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,439
It began with the mining village's Home Burial
Society.

45
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:45,510
This helped workers from our home country
in times of trouble, particularly burials.

46
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,840
Years later my father and Uncle Phala joined
the National Redemption Movement.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,569
This was an organization of exiles who were
against the government back home.

48
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:06,379
When I was a young boy, I sometimes went with
my father and Uncle Phala to the beer hall

49
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,749
where the Movement held its meetings.

50
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:15,069
They were both good organizers and fine speakers.

51
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:22,879
Whenever one of them rose to speak, the hall
became silent and people listened to every

52
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,030
word.

53
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:31,880
After they finished speaking, everybody would
clap, and I felt so proud of them.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,060
When they stopped working as miners at the
age of fifty, they began working full-time

55
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,350
for the Movement, which grew quickly, thanks
to a large exile community.

56
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,879
Over the years the news from home got worse.

57
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,180
We heard of arrests, violence, and worse.

58
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,780
It was not the government that my father and
Uncle Phala had fought for when the British

59
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,270
left in the 1960s and our country finally
became independent.

60
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:10,060
'In the beginning,' my father remembered,
'we loved them.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,229
We loved the government.

62
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,780
We thought it was ours.'

63
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,639
I remember Uncle Phala telling us when we
were small about the day of independence.

64
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,370
'Everything seemed so beautiful that day.

65
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:35,259
The sunshine felt a little gentler, the skies
were bluer, the plants were greener, and the

66
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,570
air smelled fresher.

67
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:46,389
Just before midnight the British flag was
taken down, and our flag was raised as thousands

68
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,090
clapped.

69
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,229
We loved every word our leader spoke.

70
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:59,680
We called him "the savior" - we thought he
would save us.'

71
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,750
Like so many other people, my father and Uncle
Phala spent all the money they had to go to

72
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,550
the capital for the independence ceremony
- a great day for our country.

73
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,240
At that time my father worked on a farm.

74
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,789
Soon afterwards he lost his job when the farm
was sold to one of the new government officers

75
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:31,930
who preferred to employ workers from his own
part of the country.

76
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,730
Uncle Phala lost his job because he was the
leader of a workers' organization at his factory.

77
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,800
The new government did not allow workers'
organizations any more, saying that the workers

78
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,500
had no enemies now that independence had been
won.

79
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,080
So Uncle Phala and my father left the country
a couple of years later, as so many others

80
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:04,039
had done before them, to look for jobs in
the mines of Zimbabwe.

81
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,860
The exiles in Zimbabwe learned to live with
the bad news that came from home.

82
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,250
They would discuss it and pass it on, but
it was something they did not actually experience.

83
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,070
Although exile was painful, they could hide
behind it and dream, and avoid being responsible

84
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,070
for their own lives.

85
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,550
I did not think of myself as one of them.

86
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,110
Of course, I considered where my parents came
from as my homeland too, although I had never

87
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,300
been there.

88
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,699
But I also felt strong ties to Zimbabwe, the
place of my birth.

89
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:55,080
At home we spoke my parents' language; elsewhere
we used one of the local languages.

90
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,000
I never really had to think much about my
real home until I was an adult.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,949
It didn't matter when I was a child.

92
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:11,009
Of course, the other children would sometimes
call us by rude names - whatever word was

93
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:17,240
fashionable for 'foreigners' at the time - but
it never mattered to me.

94
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,610
Not so in later years.

95
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,719
It was partly age, I suppose.

96
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:30,120
As you grow older, things seem to hurt a little
deeper.

97
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,710
The situation in Zimbabwe was also changing.

98
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:42,139
People began to think of themselves less as
Africans and more as Zimbabweans.

99
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:49,370
We became 'foreigners', even those of us who
were born in Zimbabwe, when it came to giving

100
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,630
out jobs and to finding someone to blame for
the nation's problems.

101
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,279
That is when I became more involved in the
National Redemption Movement.

102
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:09,889
Slowly, our community turned inward, and as
far as possible we kept together, helped one

103
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,480
another, and married among ourselves.

104
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,450
I married Uncle Phala's eldest daughter, Mwali,
which pleased both our parents greatly.

105
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,750
'We are now real brothers!'

106
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,190
the two men told everyone at the wedding ceremony.

107
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,180
I began to miss my homeland as much as my
father and Uncle Phala did.

108
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,470
I wanted to know more about it.

109
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:49,399
So I asked questions; I searched for information
in books, newspapers, and magazines.

110
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:58,610
I dreamed of the shining lake with its golden
sand beaches, the rivers, hills, and mountains,

111
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,080
and the cool green highlands.

112
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:10,680
A land, as my father and Uncle Phala remembered
it, of tidy villages, handsome cities, safe

113
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,100
streets, and smiling faces.

114
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:21,450
Not this dry, empty land that was only good
for exiles.

115
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,839
We hoped and dreamed.

116
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,199
In the meantime I grew older.

117
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,600
I had three children.

118
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,870
My father and Uncle Phala began to look like
the grandfathers they were.

119
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:43,940
They continued to be involved in the Movement,
but the situation in our homeland stayed the

120
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,140
same.

121
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,370
None of us thought it would change soon, although
we did not doubt that change would come in

122
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,350
the end.

123
00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:02,150
Nobody imagined how quickly the thirty-year-old
regime would fall a few years later.

124
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:08,149
People had been unhappy for years, of course,
but it was the church leaders who brought

125
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:11,060
it into the open.

126
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:19,600
One Easter Sunday the priests read out a letter
in churches throughout the country.

127
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,420
The letter did not ask for anything unusual,
just simple things like respect for the law,

128
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,740
freedom for political prisoners, food for
the hungry...

129
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,380
But the letter hit the country like a bomb.

130
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,329
No one had ever demanded these things openly
before.

131
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:49,820
Some church leaders were arrested and terrible
warnings were given.

132
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,310
But it was too late.

133
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,370
The students, young and impatient, joined
the fight.

134
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,110
'Give us free elections!'

135
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,880
they demanded.

136
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,779
'Let political prisoners go free!'

137
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:13,610
The universities and colleges were closed
and the students were sent home.

138
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,420
That only made things worse, because the students
took the message back to their home towns.

139
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,940
Then the workers joined the battle.

140
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,690
They stopped work, demanding better pay.

141
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,870
The police tried to break up one protest march,
but they only succeeded in shooting hundreds

142
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:41,440
of workers and starting angry protests all
over the country.

143
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,259
Even foreign governments and banks began to
talk about sending no more money to a regime

144
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:51,720
that had lost control.

145
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,000
I had never seen my father and Uncle Phala
so excited.

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,730
They had the radio and television on all the
time, following the news from home.

147
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,240
For some reason I was not as excited as I
had expected.

148
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,850
I had become so used to hoping and dreaming
that the possibility of return frightened

149
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,910
me.

150
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,680
Exile had always been my life.

151
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,279
It was all I knew.

152
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,949
Other things made me uneasy too.

153
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:36,730
Our community of exiles began to break into
two groups: those who wanted to return, and

154
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,170
those who were not so enthusiastic.

155
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:50,000
The same disagreements were seen in families,
and before long in the Movement itself.

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,649
At our yearly meeting there were so many arguments
that by the end the Movement had broken into

157
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,660
three separate groups.

158
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,670
It was sad to watch.

159
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:10,320
Nothing prepared me for what was waiting for
us in our dear homeland.

160
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,389
It was certainly beautiful, but that was all.

161
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,290
We went first to my father's village.

162
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,460
I was disappointed.

163
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,860
It was nothing more than a group of rough
mud houses.

164
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,730
I met some of my uncles and aunts for the
first time.

165
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:39,889
They all looked much older than my father,
although they were younger than he was.

166
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:46,209
They were nice and friendly, but that was
all they could offer us.

167
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:52,490
It was the same at my mother's village, which
was a few miles away.

168
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,620
I felt like a stranger.

169
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,579
Our relations called us machona, meaning the
long lost people.

170
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:10,360
As machona, we were expected to bring endless
presents, far more than the workers who returned

171
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,950
every two years or so, carrying huge suitcases
full of gifts for their relations - clothes,

172
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,380
blankets, radios, watches, sunglasses...

173
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,570
For a couple of months they would live like
chiefs.

174
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:38,110
Then, when all their money had gone, they
would leave for Zimbabwe once again.

175
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,540
But we disappointed our relations.

176
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:50,970
I suspected that this was one of the reasons
that my father had not returned for so long.

177
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:59,199
I also began to understand that my own people
were no different from the people of Zimbabwe,

178
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,190
who had many arguments and fights between
their different ethnic groups.

179
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,449
We were proud that our community of exiles
in the mining village had no silly ethnic

180
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:17,970
arguments of that kind, although we had people
who came from different places and ethnic

181
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,250
groups in the homeland.

182
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:28,790
My father, for example, was from the south,
and Uncle Phala from the north.

183
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:36,970
But back in our own country I heard the same
sad, silly arguments.

184
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,709
In fact, it was more serious than that.

185
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:48,350
All our politicians, old and new, seemed to
want to make trouble between the different

186
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,760
ethnic groups.

187
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:57,959
Perhaps this was because no political party
had any real ideas or plans for our country's

188
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,300
future.

189
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,990
My father, of course, soon got involved in
politics.

190
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:14,910
At first he was busy trying to start a business
with the money he had brought back from Zimbabwe.

191
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,270
Then someone asked him to be a leader of one
of the local parties.

192
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:28,690
He said no at first, but I think that was
only because he did not want to seem too enthusiastic.

193
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:36,740
'Well, I have to do what is best for my people,'
he said in the end.

194
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,010
'They need a man of my experience for leadership.'

195
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,070
It was good for his business.

196
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,650
Many of the local businesses here in the south
were owned by northerners, and people were

197
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,200
beginning to dislike this more and more.

198
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:04,110
A few weeks later I went north with my family
to visit Uncle Phala.

199
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,860
We were well received.

200
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,220
Uncle Phala proudly introduced me to his relations.

201
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,270
I liked his village better than my father's.

202
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:20,020
The place and the people seemed less miserable.

203
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,450
Mwali and I decided to make our home there
and start a business.

204
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,900
I bought two lorries to take fish from the
lake to the capital.

205
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,070
It would make me a lot of money.

206
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,940
My father was not pleased with my plan when
I returned for a visit.

207
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,250
He said I was turning my back on my people.

208
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:51,610
'But Father,' I protested, 'we're living with
Uncle Phala.

209
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,610
He's your "brother", remember?'

210
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,490
'Uncle Phala is all right.

211
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,880
It's his people who aren't.'

212
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:08,030
'I can't believe you, of all people, saying
that.'

213
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:13,020
I did not tell Uncle Phala about my father's
opinions.

214
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,820
He was pleased that we had decided to stay.

215
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,880
'You're my favourite son.

216
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,620
You've been good to my daughter.'

217
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,820
Uncle Phala did not have a son.

218
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,659
All of his eight children were girls.

219
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:39,690
Like my father, he had also started a business,
which was doing quite well.

220
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:46,070
Before long he, too, was asked to join a leading
local political party.

221
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:53,100
And like his 'brother', he waited for a while
before he agreed.

222
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:01,750
And so the two most important men in my life
became caught in the new politics.

223
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:09,450
Each party tried to organize bigger meetings,
bigger marches than the others; no one discussed

224
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,620
plans for government.

225
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,370
Political prisoners, locked up in prison,
were almost forgotten, except by their mothers.

226
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:27,470
And no party called for national discussions
on how to bring good government to our poor,

227
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,160
weak, unhappy country.

228
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,740
It was difficult not to be part of the noisy
business of politics, but I tried to stay

229
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,030
out of it.

230
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,240
I missed the quieter politics of exile.

231
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,370
Here there was no hoping, no dreaming - it
was all rough and real.

232
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,809
Too rough, in fact.

233
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:59,870
A couple of months before the elections were
held for a new government, violence broke

234
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,900
out.

235
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,760
It was not clear who started it.

236
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,490
Northerners accused southerners, and southerners
accused northerners.

237
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:19,419
Both sides chased the 'foreigners', the outsiders,
living among them.

238
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:25,650
Church leaders and others blamed the government
for making the troubles worse.

239
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,640
The government, of course, said that they
were not responsible.

240
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:39,520
Our "savior", now a very sick old man, said
the violence proved he was right.

241
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:49,600
It showed that party politics and elections
were as foreign to the country as winter.

242
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,610
One morning we were woken by a noise like
a bomb exploding.

243
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,440
We looked out of the window.

244
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,179
My lorries were on fire.

245
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,590
We all knew why, but we blamed thieves for
it.

246
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,770
It was less painful that way.

247
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:17,600
We were trying to keep the hopes and dreams
of exile alive, but we could not hide from

248
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,460
the real world any longer.

249
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:28,580
That evening Uncle Phala spoke what was on
our minds.

250
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,420
'You're not safe here.

251
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,539
Maybe you should go home.'

252
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:42,870
'I thought I was home,' I said, more in sadness
than in anger.

253
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,650
'So did I.

254
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,590
This isn't the country your father and I left
thirty years ago.

255
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:58,409
They've changed it into something else, something
terrible, that will eat us alive if we aren't

256
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,470
careful.'

257
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,760
For the first time he looked very old.

258
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,260
'We'll be out of here as soon as we can.'

259
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,179
'No, you'll go alone.

260
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:19,000
Mwali and the children will be as unsafe in
your home as you are here.'

261
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,200
'But I can't leave my family behind.'

262
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,080
'It's for their own good, and for your own
good too,' he said sadly.

263
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,170
'Believe me.'

264
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,929
'It's not right,' I said softly.

265
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,450
'It's just not right.'

266
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:50,490
He did not look at Mwali or me, but I could
see that he agreed.

267
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,880
Mwali and I spent a sleepless night discussing
the matter.

268
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,840
We decided that we would either stay together
or leave together.

269
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,500
Nothing would separate us.

270
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,809
But we did not have time to tell Uncle Phala
what we had decided, because early the next

271
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:17,810
morning we heard a large crowd shouting excitedly
outside.

272
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,500
'We want the southerner!'

273
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,840
they screamed.

274
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,530
'We want the southerner!

275
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,220
Give us the southerner!'

276
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:34,320
'Hide under the bed quick,' Mwali whispered.

277
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,100
The shouting came closer, and some people
started banging on the door.

278
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,070
Then the noise stopped, and we heard Uncle
Phala's voice.

279
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,740
'He ran away last night!'

280
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
'No!'

281
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,900
the crowd shouted with disappointment.

282
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,929
'We want the southerner!'

283
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,510
'You know how these southerners are!'

284
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,250
Uncle Phala shouted.

285
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,059
'They don't know what "brave" means.

286
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:12,860
They may be good with books and take all the
jobs for teachers and clerks, but that's all

287
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,600
they can do.

288
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,530
They can't fight.

289
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:24,390
That boy may have balls, but he's no braver
than a woman.'

290
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,090
The crowd laughed.

291
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,380
'Leave the house alone.'

292
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,840
Suddenly he called out Mwali's name.

293
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:41,200
'Come and tell these brave sons of the north
where your useless husband is.'

294
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,590
I could not believe what he was saying.

295
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,500
Had he gone crazy?

296
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,409
'What should I do?'

297
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:51,100
she asked me desperately.

298
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,100
'I don't know.

299
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,760
What's wrong with your father?

300
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,610
I thought he loved me.

301
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,990
He told me so himself.'

302
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,270
'Mwali!

303
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:09,559
Please come out and tell these men where your
good-for-nothing husband went.'

304
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,320
I felt suddenly angry.

305
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,570
'Go.

306
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,870
He's your father.'

307
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,740
I pushed her and she started crying.

308
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,740
'Go, I said!'

309
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,820
'Don't scream.

310
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,940
They'll hear you.'

311
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,390
She tried to get herself under control.

312
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,650
'Please stay where you are.

313
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,130
Don't move,' she said as she went unwillingly
to the door.

314
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,250
'See, she's crying,' Uncle Phala said when
she came out.

315
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,950
'I told her not to marry a southerner!'

316
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,910
The crowd began to go away, still shouting
about southerners.

317
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,220
Moments later Mwali returned, looking both
shaken and thankful.

318
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,380
I stayed indoors the whole day.

319
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,860
Later Uncle Phala came to me.

320
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,740
I could see the unhappiness on his face.

321
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,000
'I'm sorry I had to say all those things.'

322
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,649
'So you didn't mean it,' I said coldly.

323
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:23,649
'Of course not.'

324
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:25,799
He was trying not to cry.

325
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:33,590
'That was the only way I could save you, by
talking their kind of language.

326
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:41,770
You'll always be my favourite son, no matter
what.'

327
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:47,490
I do not know how long we sat there, staring
at the walls.

328
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:53,679
We all wished to be back in the old days of
exile.

329
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,350
I escaped that night, and my people were thankful
to see me safe.

330
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:08,289
'I always told you that northerners are cruel
and wild,' my father said.

331
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:12,400
I could not remember him ever saying that.

332
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,330
But I did not feel like arguing with him.

333
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:24,220
I just wanted to sleep and dream of the simpler
days of exile.

334
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,290
The elections were held on time.

335
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:34,240
The old governing party just managed to win,
but the other political parties refused to

336
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,019
accept the results and did not recognize the
government.

337
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:46,919
While this argument went on, the army appeared
on the streets, and the frightened country

338
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,539
became calm.

339
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:56,320
It seemed safe enough for me to ask Mwali
and the children to come.

340
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,770
Uncle Phala came with them.

341
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:07,410
When the two old men met, they put their arms
round each other.

342
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:16,010
For a while it seemed like the old days, except
that they both looked so much older now.

343
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,570
They were both much thinner.

344
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:27,529
Uncle Phala walked even more painfully, and
my father could not see or hear very well.

345
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:30,820
But it was not the old days.

346
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,840
They had little to talk about.

347
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,059
It was painful to watch.

348
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:42,140
The friendliness and the laughter had all
gone.

349
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,570
The days of exile now seemed so far away and
unreal.

350
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:54,789
And yet we had been back for about a year.

351
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,960
Uncle Phala only stayed a couple of days.

352
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,740
He left early in the morning.

353
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,899
We all went with him to the bus station, except
for my mother who was not feeling well.

354
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:15,769
My father and Uncle Phala stood in silence
with their arms round each other for what

355
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:20,049
seemed like a long time.

356
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:26,300
From the steps of the bus Uncle Phala waved
to us with his stick.

357
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,049
waved in return.

358
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:33,980
Then he climbed painfully onto the bus and
never looked back.

359
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,330
- THE END -
