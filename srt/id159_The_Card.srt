CHAPTER ONE
The Dance

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:13,340
Edward Henry Machin first saw daylight on
the 27th of May, 1867, in Brougham Street

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:22,570
in Bursley, the oldest of the Five Towns.
Brougham Street goes down a hill to the canal,

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:31,590
and contains a number of potbanks or pottery
factories as well as some small houses. The

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:39,890
rent for one of these houses was not high
- only about twenty-three pence a week.

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:49,209
Edward Henry's mother (his father was dead)
lived by making and washing clothes for fine

7
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:58,589
ladies. She did not often laugh, and if you
tried to argue with her, you never got very

8
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:10,590
far. She was a woman of few words, and saved
time every day by calling her son Denry, instead

9
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,460
of Edward Henry.

10
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:23,719
Denry did not work hard at school, and boys
who were lazy and not very clever usually

11
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:32,869
just found jobs in the potbanks. Luckily,
at the age of twelve, he won a place at the

12
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:44,130
best school in Bursley. It happened like this.
On the second day of the examination, Denry

13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:53,219
arrived a little early. As he walked around
the examination room, he came to the teacher's

14
00:01:53,219 --> 00:02:02,780
desk, where he saw a list of names with the
marks for the first day of the examination.

15
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:12,930
The highest possible mark was thirty, but
next to his name he saw the number 7. The

16
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:22,709
numbers were written in pencil, and the pencil
was on the desk. He picked it up, looked around

17
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:32,921
the empty room, and at the door, and then
wrote a 2 in front of the 7. Of course, this

18
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:42,569
was not honest, but how many truly honest
schoolboys are there? Denry was no worse than

19
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,400
most of them.

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:54,450
Denry did not do well at his new school, but
he did not do badly either - and he was usually

21
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:05,200
very pleased with himself. As he grew older,
he continued to think well of himself. He

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:15,310
knew that he was made for better things than
a job in the potbanks, working with his hands.

23
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,310
***

24
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:25,930
When Denry was sixteen, his mother made a
very fine dress for Mr Duncalf's sister. Mr

25
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:36,120
Duncalf was the most important lawyer in Bursley.
His sister was grateful to Mrs Machin, and

26
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:47,850
so Denry got a job in Mr Duncalf's office.
For several years Denry was happy. Then he

27
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,500
met the Countess.

28
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,760
The Countess of Chell was a very grand lady.
Her husband was one of the richest men in

29
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:09,250
the Five Towns and was the new Mayor of Bursley.
The mayor and his wife had decided to have

30
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:18,600
a ball and to invite all the most important
people in the town. There were thirty-five

31
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:28,510
thousand people in Bursley, and at least two
thousand of these thought that they were important.

32
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:35,540
But only two hundred could dance in the Town
Hall.

33
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:43,250
Three weeks and three days before the ball,
Denry was sitting, alone, in Mr Duncalf's

34
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:53,580
office when a tall and pretty young woman
walked in. Before Denry could hide the newspaper

35
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:02,140
he was reading, she said 'Good morning' in
a very friendly way.

36
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,700
'Good morning, madam,' answered Denry.

37
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,080
'Is Mr Duncalf in?'

38
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,210
'No, madam. He's at the Town Hall.'

39
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,730
'Well, just tell him I called.'

40
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:25,310
'Of course, madam. Nothing I can do?'

41
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:33,910
She was already turning away, but she turned
back and gave him a smile. 'Could you give

42
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:42,230
him this list? The other lists are coming
to him as well. The invitations must go out

43
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,880
by Wednesday.'

44
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,910
She was gone. It was the first time Denry
had seen the Countess, and she was even more

45
00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:03,200
beautiful than her photographs. And so easy
to talk to! He started looking at her list

46
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:15,680
of names, and he had a fantastic idea. He
could go to the ball himself. The Countess

47
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:24,500
had made a list of people to invite, but she
had asked four or five other people for lists

48
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:34,540
as well. She wanted Mr Duncalf to put the
lists together and send the invitations. Of

49
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:46,070
course the work was given to Denry, so it
was easy to add E. H. Machin to the list.

50
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:57,250
On Wednesday Denry received his invitation,
and on Thursday he accepted it.

51
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,250
***

52
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:06,000
Denry had never been to a ball. He couldn't
dance and he didn't have an evening suit.

53
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,270
All the rich young men of Bursley bought their
suits at Shillitoe's, so two days later Denry

54
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:25,630
stepped into Shillitoe's shop. 'I want you
to make me an evening suit,' he said to young

55
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,160
Shillitoe.

56
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:36,850
Shillitoe knew Denry and he also knew that
Denry did not have enough money to pay for

57
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:50,320
a suit. He replied that he was too busy. 'So
you're going to the ball, are you?' he asked,

58
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
surprised.

59
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,900
'Yes,' said Denry; 'are you?'

60
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:03,980
Shillitoe shook his head. 'I've no time for
balls.'

61
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:13,020
Denry looked around the shop, and at the door,
and then said, 'I can get you an invitation

62
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,710
if you like.'

63
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:23,840
Denry got his suit, and two years to pay for
it.

64
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:32,599
One of the best dancing teachers in Bursley
was Miss Ruth Earp. Denry learned to dance

65
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:45,550
quickly, but he paid nothing for his lessons.
Miss Earp also got an invitation to the ball.

66
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:55,910
Miss Earp was not beautiful, but she was young
and a very good dancer, and at his last lesson

67
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,870
Denry asked, 'Will you give me the first dance
at the ball?'

68
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,490
Ruth Earp thought for a minute, and then said
yes.

69
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,490
***

70
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:19,470
It took Denry two hours to get ready for the
ball, and he arrived a little late. He walked

71
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:28,310
up the beautiful double staircase into the
ballroom and looked for Ruth. When he found

72
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,540
her, he asked, 'What about that first dance?'

73
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,509
'It's nearly finished,' she answered, coldly.

74
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:45,209
'I'm awfully sorry. Can we finish it?'

75
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,319
'No!' she said, and walked away.

76
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:59,639
She was angry with him, and Denry did not
know what to say. But she was only at the

77
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:07,769
ball, he thought, because he had got her invitation
for her!

78
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:15,480
He joined a group of young men who were watching
the dancing. Harold Etches, who was one of

79
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,360
the richest young men in the Five Towns, was
there, with two or three of the Swetnam boys,

80
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:33,769
and Shillitoe. At first Denry did not say
anything. They all knew, of course, that he

81
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:42,560
was Mr Duncalf's office worker and the son
of a washer-woman, but all young men - rich

82
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,860
or poor - look the same in evening suits.

83
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:56,999
The conversation in the group was about the
Countess. All the important older men in the

84
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:07,310
town were standing around her, but she was
not dancing. Perhaps she didn't want to, but

85
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,070
perhaps they were all afraid to ask.

86
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:19,209
'Why doesn't someone ask her to dance?' asked
Denry suddenly.

87
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:28,249
'Why don't you?' said Shillitoe. 'It's a free
country.'

88
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:33,430
'Perhaps I will,' Denry said.

89
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:45,029
Harold Etches looked at Denry for a moment.'
You won't ask her,' he said. Then he smiled,

90
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:51,459
not very pleasantly. 'I'll give you five pounds
if you do.'

91
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:58,000
'All right,' said Denry, and quickly walked
away.

92
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:11,240
'She can't eat me! She can't eat me!' he said
to himself as he walked towards the Countess.

93
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:21,360
The men were still around her and one of them,
Denry saw, was Mr Duncalf. Denry was sorry

94
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:32,100
about this because Mr Duncalf didn't know,
of course, that Denry was coming to the ball.

95
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:40,059
Suddenly he found himself standing in front
of the Countess, and immediately he forgot

96
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:45,819
all the fine, polite words that Ruth Earp
had taught him.

97
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:56,079
'Could I have this dance with you?' he said
quickly, but smiling and showing his teeth.

98
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:05,209
('I've won that fiver, Mr Etches!' he said
to himself.)

99
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:13,899
The Countess had to accept. She could see
that everyone else was afraid to ask - and

100
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:25,740
she did want to dance! So they danced together,
and all the men of Bursley watched with open

101
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:35,069
mouths. Denry managed to dance well most of
the time, although once they nearly hit two

102
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:45,160
other dancers. When the music stopped, the
Countess looked at Denry and saw that he was

103
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,100
really just a boy.

104
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,529
'You dance well!' she said, smiling almost
like an aunt.

105
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:07,439
'Do I?' he smiled back. 'It's the first time
I've ever danced, except in a lesson.'

106
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:14,029
'Really? You pick things up easily, I suppose.'

107
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:20,220
'Yes,' he said. 'Do you?'

108
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:30,279
Something in Denry's question amused the Countess
very much. She put her head back and laughed,

109
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:39,170
and everybody in the room could see that Denry
had made the Countess laugh. She was still

110
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:47,329
laughing, and so was he, when he thanked her
for the dance.

111
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:56,249
As she turned away, Denry saw that she had
dropped her fan. Quickly, he picked it up

112
00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:03,879
and put it in his pocket. Then he walked back
to the group of young men.

113
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:14,740
'Here you are!' said Harold Etches, giving
Denry a five-pound note.

114
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:23,449
Denry just smiled, and put the note in his
pocket. He could see in the faces of the young

115
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:33,640
men around him that he was suddenly famous.
He was no longer just the son of a washer-woman;

116
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:41,269
he was the man who had first danced with the
Countess.

117
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:48,329
'Just the same as dancing with any other woman,'
he said, when Shillitoe asked him what it

118
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,860
was like.

119
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,560
'What was she laughing at?' someone asked.

120
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:03,290
'Ah!' said Denry. 'I can't tell you that.'

121
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:12,970
This was not the last time he was asked that
question, but he always refused to answer.

122
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:20,070
Many young ladies wanted to dance with him
now, after his success with the Countess.

123
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:30,959
Later, he saw Ruth Earp again and danced with
her, and with her young friend, Nellie. But

124
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:38,550
he said nothing at all about the Countess's
fan in his pocket.

125
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:45,999
At the end of the ball, just as the Countess
was leaving, Denry pushed through the crowd

126
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,689
and held out her fan.

127
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:53,760
'I've just picked it up,' he said to the Countess.

128
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:06,560
'Oh! Thank you so much!' she said. Then she
smiled. 'You do pick things up easily, don't

129
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,920
you?'

130
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:20,060
And both Denry and the Countess laughed and
laughed, but nobody in Bursley knew why.

131
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:29,180
Denry walked home that night in a dream, thinking
about the Countess, Ruth Earp and Nellie,

132
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:36,740
and about the five-pound note in his pocket
- more than he got for a month's work in Mr

133
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,530
Duncalf's office.

134
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:51,020
He was a happy man. But trouble was waiting
for him.

135
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:58,580
CHAPTER TWO
The Rent Collector and the Widow Hullins

136
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:07,870
The ball made a new man of Denry. He had danced
with the Countess - the first man to dance

137
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:18,870
with her. Bursley thought he was a wonderful
fellow, and so did Denry himself. He had always

138
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:30,040
been a hopeful, cheerful kind of person. Now
he was filled with happiness all the time,

139
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:38,530
and when he got out of bed in the morning,
he felt like singing and dancing. Something

140
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:50,920
good was going to happen, he knew; he just
had to wait. He didn't have to wait very long.

141
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:01,150
A few days after the ball, Mrs Codleyn came
to see Mr Duncalf. Mrs Codleyn was a widow,

142
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:11,160
a woman of nearly sixty. She owned about seventy
small houses in Bursley, and Mr Duncalf collected

143
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:20,281
the rents for her. (Denry, of course, actually
went to the houses to get the money.) Although

144
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:28,480
the rent from all these houses was about twelve
pounds a week, Mrs Codleyn always said that

145
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:39,930
it was not enough. And the taxes! Every year
the taxes on those houses got higher and higher,

146
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:46,520
and Mrs Codleyn hated paying her taxes.

147
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:55,000
Mr Duncalf was an important man at the Town
Hall. Because of this, Mrs Codleyn thought

148
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,451
that he should make the taxes lower on her
houses. Mrs Codleyn had chosen Mr Duncalf

149
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:11,630
to collect her rents because she thought he
was an honest man - but an honest man would

150
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:20,890
never try to change the taxes specially for
one person. What strange ideas people have

151
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,690
sometimes!

152
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:32,900
Mrs Codleyn had just heard that her taxes
were going up again, but she did not stay

153
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:41,820
long in Mr Duncalf's office. The conversation
(which Denry listened to through the wall)

154
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:53,280
was short, loud, and not very polite. When
Mrs Codleyn left, Mr Duncalf called Denry

155
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,010
into his office.

156
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:06,620
'Write this letter to Mrs Codleyn,' he said
angrily. 'Madam, I understand from our conversation

157
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:14,530
this morning that you prefer to find another
lawyer...'

158
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:24,650
Denry wrote down the letter. As he was leaving
the room, Mr Duncalf spoke again.

159
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,190
'Machin!'

160
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,740
Denry knew what was coming. He had known it
was coming ever since the ball.

161
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,370
'Who invited you to the ball?'

162
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,760
There it was. A very difficult question.

163
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:52,760
'I did, sir.' Denry just could not think of
a lie.

164
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,870
'Why?'

165
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,060
'I thought perhaps you'd forgotten to, sir.'

166
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:07,660
'I suppose you think you're a really fine
fellow after your dance with the Countess?'

167
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,920
Mr Duncalf said unpleasantly.

168
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:18,390
'Yes,' said Denry. 'Do you?'

169
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:26,240
He had not meant to say it. The same little
question had amused the Countess greatly,

170
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:35,390
but it was true to say that it was not amusing
his employer now. Mr Duncalf's own dance with

171
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:45,110
the Countess had come to a very quick ending,
because he had stepped heavily on her skirt.

172
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:53,250
'You will leave my office at the end of the
week,' said Mr Duncalf, coldly.

173
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:06,720
'Oh, very well,' said Denry. And he said to
himself: 'Something good must happen now.'

174
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:15,060
He had no idea what he would do next, but
he was still cheerful. And he still had Harold

175
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,280
Etches' five pounds.

176
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:28,630
The next morning both Mrs Codleyn and Denry
were late for church. Mrs Codleyn was late

177
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:37,630
by accident and also because she was fat.
Denry was late because he had planned it that

178
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,530
way. The two met at the church door.

179
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:53,010
'Well, you're nice people, I must say!' Mrs
Codleyn said to Denry. She meant Duncalf and

180
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,570
all his office workers.

181
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,010
'Nothing to do with me, you know!' said Denry.

182
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:06,830
'I wish I could find someone else to collect
my rents.'

183
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:14,680
'I can still collect them for you, if you
like,' said Denry.

184
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,920
'You?'

185
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:26,150
'I've told Duncalf I'm leaving him,' Denry
said. 'The fact is, he and I don't agree on

186
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,910
a lot of things.'

187
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:38,190
Mrs Codleyn looked at him and thought about
it. He was just a young office worker, and

188
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:46,830
his mother was a washer-woman. His suit was
clean, but old and unfashionable.

189
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:58,520
'And what's more,' Denry went on, 'I'll do
the work for less money. You pay Duncalf ninety

190
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:07,570
pence a week - well, I'll do it for sixty
pence a week. And I'll collect them better

191
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:14,560
than him. Give me a month and you'll see the
difference!'

192
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:22,920
At the end of the week a notice appeared on
the front door of Denry's mother's house,

193
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,140
which said:

194
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,210
E. H. MACHIN

195
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,780
Rent Collector

196
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:40,740
In a few weeks, Denry was doing very well.
He was working for himself, and in two days

197
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:50,220
he earned more money than in a week with Mr
Duncalf. He walked around the town, smiling,

198
00:25:50,220 --> 00:26:03,140
looking important, talking to other young
men, and thinking of new ways of making money.

199
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
***

200
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:11,710
One Monday morning he went to Mrs Hullins'
house to collect the rent. It was a very small

201
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:21,470
house, not much more than one room downstairs
and one room upstairs. The rent was fifteen

202
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:31,580
pence a week, and the Widow Hullins had not
paid any rent at all for some weeks. She had

203
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:42,950
lived there all her life, and after two husbands
and eleven children, she now lived alone.

204
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:49,710
She had seen a lot of life, and was old and
tired.

205
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,130
'I've nothing for you,' she said when Denry
came in.

206
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:04,560
'That's not good enough, I'm afraid,' said
Denry cheerfully. 'I'm not leaving until I

207
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,720
get ten pence.'

208
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:17,830
'It'll be a long wait. I'll have nothing until
Saturday, when my son Jack starts a new job.'

209
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:30,640
'I'm sorry,' said Denry kindly, 'but if you
don't pay, you'll have to go. Mrs Codleyn

210
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:39,210
will put you out in the street, you know.
Why don't you go and live with one of your

211
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,210
children?'

212
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:49,710
After some more conversation, Denry left the
house, still smiling cheerfully. And then,

213
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,180
two minutes later, he put his head round the
door again.

214
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:05,290
'Look here, mother,' he said, 'I'll lend you
ten pence if you like. But you must pay me

215
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:16,440
a penny a week for it. You must pay me back
next week and give me eleven pence.'

216
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,380
And he wrote down 'Ten pence, paid' in her
rent book.

217
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:32,540
'Eh, you're a funny fellow, Mr Machin,' said
Mrs Hullins.

218
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:39,410
The next Monday, all the neighbours knew that
Denry could be very helpful about problems

219
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:49,400
with the rent. And Denry, with his cheerful,
smiling face, saved many families from a life

220
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:59,901
in the street. Of course, it was good business
for him, too. If someone borrowed ten pence

221
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:09,570
for four weeks, when they paid Denry back,
they had to give him fourteen pence. If it

222
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:20,510
was for six months, they had to pay him back
thirty-six pence. Money made like this just

223
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:26,160
grows and grows.

224
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,860
Denry began to think that he was different
from other men. He had invited himself to

225
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:43,450
the ball, danced with the Countess, left his
job with Duncalf, taken Duncalf's rent-collecting,

226
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:53,390
and then introduced the idea of collecting
rents and lending money at the same time.

227
00:29:53,390 --> 00:30:02,890
He was becoming well-known in Bursley as an
unusual and amusing fellow - in other words,

228
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,330
a card.

229
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:15,080
But then the day came when Mrs Codleyn decided
to sell some of her smaller houses. This was

230
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:25,300
very bad news for Denry because these houses
were the most important part of his business.

231
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:33,340
Denry talked to her, and tried to show her
that it was not a sensible idea, but it was

232
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:44,590
no good. Finally, Denry said wildly that he
would buy some of the houses himself.

233
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:55,010
'I'll buy the Widow Hullins' house,' he said.
'I'll give you forty-five pounds for it.'

234
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,190
It was all the money he had.

235
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:10,490
Mrs Codleyn agreed. And selling this one house,
for the moment, seemed to be enough for her.

236
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,490
***

237
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:18,090
Denry was now a property owner. And he had
also joined the Sports Club - the club for

238
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:26,700
the rich, the fashionable, and the successful
men of Bursley. It was a great thing for the

239
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,070
son of a washer-woman to join a club like
this.

240
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:40,110
On Denry's second visit to the club, he saw
that some of the most important men in Bursley

241
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:47,960
were there. A group of them were arguing in
a corner of the comfortable bar.

242
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:57,570
'Some of the poor people in this town live
in the most terrible old houses,' said Charles

243
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:07,430
Fearns, a lawyer. 'And the town just doesn't
care about them. There's an old woman - Hullins

244
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:17,810
is her name - who's lived in the same awful
old house for fifty years. She pays fifteen

245
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:25,810
pence a week rent for this place, and now
she's going to be put out into the street

246
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,750
because she can't pay.'

247
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:34,160
'Who's the hard-hearted owner?' someone asked.

248
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,890
'Mrs Codleyn,' said Fearns.

249
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:48,540
'Mrs Codleyn isn't the owner,' called Denry,
who was sitting at the next table, smiling.

250
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,050
'I am.'

251
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,711
'Oh, I'm sorry,' said Fearns, 'I had no idea-'

252
00:32:56,711 --> 00:33:09,310
'Not at all!' said Denry. 'But what can I
do? She can't pay, or doesn't want to pay.

253
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:17,841
Do I let her live in the house for no rent
because she's seventy? Come on, tell me. What

254
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,840
do I do?'

255
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:28,780
'Fearns would make her a present of the house!'
a voice said laughing, and everybody else

256
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,450
laughed too.

257
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:41,720
'Well, that's what I'll do,' said Denry. 'I'll
give her the house. That's the kind of hard-hearted

258
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,310
owner I am.'

259
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,210
The room was silent for a moment.

260
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:59,110
'I mean it!' said Denry, and picked up his
glass. 'She can have the house! Good health

261
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,200
to the Widow Hullins.'

262
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:12,060
And the next morning, everybody in Bursley
was talking about it. 'I say, have you heard

263
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,429
Machin's latest?'

264
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:26,069
He was now not just a card; he was the card.

265
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:33,210
CHAPTER THREE
The Dancing Teacher and the Furniture Van

266
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:41,839
One day in July Denry knocked at the door
of a house at the top of Brougham Street.

267
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:50,210
The dancing teacher, Miss Ruth Earp, lived
there, in a house owned by Mr Calvert, and

268
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:56,230
Denry now collected Mr Calvert's rents for
him.

269
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:03,150
'Good morning, Miss Earp,' said Denry, when
she opened the door. 'I've come about the

270
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,319
rent.'

271
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:13,829
'The rent?' said Ruth, surprised. She gave
him a look which seemed to say, 'Why does

272
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:19,300
a little boy like you ask about my rent?'

273
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:29,519
'Yes. I collect rents for Mr Calvert now,'
Denry said. He did not like the 'little boy'

274
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:39,140
look on her face, and added, 'You haven't
paid any rent for more than a year.'

275
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:50,079
Ruth Earp gave a hard little laugh. 'I see,'
she said. 'So Mr Herbert Calvert is paying

276
00:35:50,079 --> 00:36:00,400
you to do his dirty work now. I must tell
you, Mr Machin, that not long ago Mr Calvert

277
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:09,519
was more interested in me than in my rent.
But when I decided that I could not return

278
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:17,329
his interest, he said things which hurt me
very much - very much indeed.'

279
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:27,940
'Oh,' said Denry. He told himself that he
was here on business.

280
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:36,380
'But if you can't pay your rent, Miss Earp,
I'm afraid you'll have to leave.'

281
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:46,289
Ruth looked at him, and then gave a slow,
sad smile. 'Of course I can pay it,' she said

282
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:55,970
gently. 'I just wanted to punish Mr Calvert
a little. I can't pay you just at this moment,

283
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:04,650
I'm afraid. The bank is closed. Can you come
back tomorrow? Come at four o'clock, and I'll

284
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,030
give you a cup of tea.'

285
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:17,839
The next day Denry returned. It was the first
time he had taken tea with a young lady, and

286
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,829
so he had put on his best summer suit. He
noticed that Ruth was wearing a very pretty

287
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:32,660
dress - something white with bits of pink
in it.

288
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:41,339
Ruth had introduced Denry to dancing, and
now she introduced him to taking tea. It was

289
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:49,960
all very beautifully done - tea in very small
cups, little squares of bread-and-butter,

290
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:58,049
and interesting conversation. Ruth seemed
much more friendly today, and Denry found

291
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:01,970
it all very pleasant.

292
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:10,670
Then suddenly Ruth stopped speaking, and lay
back in her chair with her eyes closed.

293
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,710
'Is something the matter?' asked Denry.

294
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:21,249
'I'm afraid I've got an awful headache,' she
answered.

295
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:31,329
'I'm sorry,' said Denry. 'Is there anything
I can do? Perhaps you should lie down. Would

296
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,460
you like me to go?'

297
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:43,020
'But I must pay you the rent first.' She put
her hand to her head. 'The money's in that

298
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,609
desk. Could you get it for me?'

299
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:56,140
She gave Denry a key. He went over to the
desk, put the key in the lock, and tried to

300
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:09,490
turn it. Nothing happened, and then the key
turned and turned. 'I can't open it,' he said.

301
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:19,329
Ruth stood up, holding her head. She came
over to the desk, and tried the key. 'Oh dear.

302
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:25,770
I'm afraid you've broken the lock. I'll have
to get someone to mend it tomorrow morning,

303
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,380
and then I'll bring the money round to you.'

304
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:39,160
'Don't worry,' said Denry. 'I can easily call
back for it tomorrow. And I'm very sorry about

305
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
the lock.'

306
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,710
***

307
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:50,170
Late that night Denry came home from an evening
at the Sports Club and just as he reached

308
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:59,119
his mother's house, he saw something strange
at the top end of Brougham Street. A large

309
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:08,369
furniture van was moving down the street all
on its own; there were no horses. Clearly,

310
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:16,769
the owner had left it there and forgotten
to put on the brakes. It was moving slowly

311
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:23,829
now, but Denry could see that when it reached
the bottom of Brougham Street, it could be

312
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:28,400
very dangerous.

313
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:36,980
Denry was always at his finest at difficult
or dangerous moments. As the van passed him,

314
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:45,090
moving at about five or six kilometres an
hour, he jumped on, losing his hat, and tried

315
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:54,609
to put the brakes on. For a second or two
the van seemed to slow down, but then Denry

316
00:40:54,609 --> 00:41:02,869
realized that the brakes were not working
and the van was moving faster and faster down

317
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:11,720
the hill. At the bottom of the street was
the canal, and clearly nothing was going to

318
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:21,559
stop the van now. It was too late to jump
off, so Denry closed his eyes and held on

319
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,450
hard.

320
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:33,259
When the van went in, Denry was under water
for a moment, but then he managed to climb

321
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:42,619
further up on the front of the van. Everything
was still and dark, except for a little starlight

322
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:51,869
on the water. Only Denry had seen the van's
strange journey down the hill.

323
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:59,269
'Well, well!' he said aloud to himself.

324
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:07,069
And a voice answered from inside the van:
'Who's there?'

325
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:14,230
Denry's heart seemed to stop beating. 'It's
me!' he said.

326
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,930
'Not Mr Machin?' said the voice.

327
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:28,349
'Yes,' said he. 'I jumped on as it came down
the street - and here we are!'

328
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:36,299
'Oh!' cried the voice. 'I wish you could get
round to me.'

329
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:46,490
It was Ruth Earp's voice. Denry understood
immediately. Ruth had played with him! She

330
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:54,849
had planned to take her furniture and run
away in the night. She had no rent money locked

331
00:42:54,849 --> 00:43:06,329
in her desk at all. But he was not angry with
her, just amused. Ruth was really very clever

332
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:13,650
- in fact, very like Denry himself.

333
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:21,220
He had to climb over the roof of the van to
get to the back. The van was black inside,

334
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,380
and the floor was under fifty centimetres
of water.

335
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,900
'Where are you?'

336
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:37,599
'I'm here. I'm on a table. It's the only thing
the men put in the van before they went to

337
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,119
have their supper.'

338
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,329
Denry felt around until he touched her wet
dress.

339
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:52,349
'You're a bad girl, you know,' he said.

340
00:43:52,349 --> 00:44:05,720
Ruth started to cry. 'I know,' she said miserably.
'But I had no money. What could I do?'

341
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,069
Denry climbed on to the table next to her.

342
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:13,740
'What can we do now?' she whispered.

343
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,410
'Wait until it gets light,' said he.

344
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:26,789
So they waited. On a hot July night it is
not unpleasant to sit in the dark with your

345
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:37,109
feet in water. Ruth told Denry all about her
life and her money problems.

346
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:43,480
When it started to get light, Denry saw that
the back of the van was only a metre from

347
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:53,900
the edge of the canal, so they jumped. In
the grey early light they looked at one another.

348
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:00,480
Ruth had a black eye, and Denry had lost his
hat.

349
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:08,421
'Go home by the back streets, not up Brougham
Street,' said Denry. 'I'll come and see you

350
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:12,200
in the morning.'

351
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,890
It was four o'clock in the morning when Denry
went quietly up his mother's stairs. He had

352
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,269
seen nobody.

353
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:25,269
***

354
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:32,069
Only two people in Bursley ever knew exactly
what had happened that night. Everybody knew

355
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:39,359
that Denry had tried to save the town from
a dangerous runaway van and had ended in the

356
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:49,109
canal. But as well as this one fact, there
were a great many stories about the accident,

357
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:59,329
and in these stories the names of Denry and
Ruth were always appearing.

358
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:08,220
One morning Denry went to see Mr Herbert Calvert
and gave him ten pounds which he said came

359
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,059
from Ruth Earp.

360
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:20,730
Calvert gave Denry a strange look. 'What's
going on?' he asked. 'Is it true that she

361
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:24,109
was trying to leave without paying?'

362
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:34,950
'I don't think so. It's all very extraordinary.
I think the van was at the wrong house.'

363
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:42,239
'Are you engaged to her?' asked Calvert.

364
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:51,759
Denry waited for a moment. 'Yes,' he said.
'Are you?'

365
00:46:51,759 --> 00:47:02,109
And Denry thought to himself that few engagements
had begun as strangely as theirs.

366
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:07,759
CHAPTER FOUR
Saved by a Storm

367
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:15,280
When newly engaged people like Denry and Ruth
want to go away on a summer holiday, there

368
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:23,509
are many things to think about. A businessman,
for example, who lives by collecting rents

369
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:33,479
every week cannot go away easily for two.
And a young woman who lives alone must always

370
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:41,349
be careful about what other people think,
so Ruth asked her friend Nellie Cotterill

371
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:44,529
to go with her.

372
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:53,720
Ruth and Nellie took a room together at 26
St Asaph's Road, Llandudno. Denry took a room

373
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:02,540
at number 28 St Asaph's Road. Who could want
more?

374
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:10,290
Denry had never seen the sea before. As he
walked along the beach in his best clothes,

375
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:20,180
with the girls on either side of him, he thought
it was all wonderful. He also saw fantastic

376
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:29,420
possibilities for making money, because here
were fifty thousand people, all on holiday,

377
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:39,019
all wanting to do interesting things, and
all with money to spend.

378
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:46,940
Denry thought about this a lot because he
felt he was now a serious person. He had something

379
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:55,950
to live for. He was very pleased and happy
to be engaged to Ruth, although still a little

380
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:02,789
surprised. What could this fine young lady
see in him?

381
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:13,599
They had not discussed money at all, although
Denry wanted to. It was clear that Ruth thought

382
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:22,220
he was a rich man, and Denry was spending
a lot of money. In fact, he could not move

383
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:32,640
without paying for something. The pier, swimming,
ice cream, chairs, fruit, boat trips, photographs,

384
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:41,640
teas, coffees - even a short walk with Ruth
was expensive.

385
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:49,309
Ruth had very little money, but it didn't
worry her. She didn't know what money was,

386
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:58,430
and she spent Denry's like water. The gentle,
silent Nellie often asked to pay for something

387
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:07,789
herself, but of course Denry couldn't let
her. He liked Nellie Cotterill. She thought

388
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:15,710
that he and Ruth were wonderful, and although
she was a very quiet person, she was also

389
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,960
very sensible.

390
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:27,910
At the end of the first week Denry was getting
more and more worried about money. On the

391
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:35,420
Monday morning he went back to Bursley to
collect rents, and returned to Llandudno on

392
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:44,539
Tuesday evening with his pockets full of rent
money. Something had to happen, he thought.

393
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:51,460
He didn't know what it was, but three months
of engagement with Ruth Earp was going to

394
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,310
leave him penniless.

395
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,310
***

396
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:04,349
He was saved by a storm at sea. They woke
up on Wednesday morning to find the rain and

397
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:13,279
wind crashing against the windows. The three
walked down into the town, where they learnt

398
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:21,640
that the town's lifeboat had gone out to a
ship further along the coast. A second lifeboat

399
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:29,880
(an old one, now owned by a fisherman) had
gone out to a Norwegian ship, the Hjalmar,

400
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:37,910
which was in difficulties just off Llandudno
itself. Everyone in the town was watching

401
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:46,609
the lifeboat save the sailors while the ship
went down. Denry and the girls went onto the

402
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:54,049
pier, and Denry even got his feet wet helping
one or two of the Norwegian sailors from the

403
00:51:54,049 --> 00:52:05,410
lifeboat onto the pier. After that, he talked
for a time to Cregeen, the owner of the lifeboat.

404
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:12,039
It was a very exciting day, and it gave Denry
an idea.

405
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:19,970
'I'll write a report about all this for the
Signal,' he said. This was the Five Towns

406
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,839
daily newspaper.

407
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:29,160
'Oh yes!' said Nellie. 'What a good idea!'

408
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:38,289
The next morning Denry was up early to send
the report off by train. Then he and the girls

409
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:48,519
walked into town - and spent more money. Everybody
in the town was talking about the storm, the

410
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:58,229
wreck of the Hjalmar and the wonderful rescue
of all the Norwegian sailors by the lifeboat.

411
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:03,039
After a few minutes, Ruth turned to Denry.

412
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:08,940
'I had the bill for our room this morning,'
she said.

413
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,779
'Oh!' he said. 'Did you pay it?'

414
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:21,970
'Yes. But now I've almost no money left. We
spent so much money while you were away in

415
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:33,049
Bursley. You don't know how quickly money
goes!' She waited a moment, then said, 'I

416
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:35,730
suppose we'll have to go home.'

417
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:41,859
'What a pity!' said Denry, sadly.

418
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:49,829
Of course, Ruth wanted Denry to say that he
could pay for her to stay. But all he said

419
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:53,890
was, 'What a pity!'

420
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,859
'I think I'll go home this afternoon.'

421
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:02,330
'I'm sorry,' said Denry.

422
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:10,390
At that moment a hand touched his arm. It
was Cregeen.

423
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:19,339
'Mr Machin. It's now or never. It's twenty-five
pounds if you can pay today.'

424
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:28,569
'Right!' said Denry. 'I'll see you this evening.'

425
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:33,150
Ruth pretended not to be interested in any
of this.

426
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,150
***

427
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:42,829
Poor Nellie. She knew something was wrong,
but she didn't know what it was. All she knew

428
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:51,210
was that her holiday was coming to a sudden
end. In the evening, the three of them walked

429
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,940
to the station.

430
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:59,390
'Where's your luggage?' Ruth asked Denry.

431
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:05,270
'I'm not going. I've got business here.'

432
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:12,809
There was a bookshop in the station. Denry
bought the Signal, which had just come in,

433
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:22,260
and there was his report: 'Terrible Storm
in North Wales - a report by Mr E. H. Machin

434
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:31,450
of Bursley'. Denry was ready to explode with
happiness, but he gave the newspaper calmly

435
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:34,270
to Ruth.

436
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:42,400
She did not look at it. 'We'll read it on
the train,' she said.

437
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:50,410
The bookshop also had a lot of souvenirs of
Llandudno. Ruth wanted a glass plate with

438
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:59,869
a picture of Great Orme Head on it, but the
man in the shop said that they had sold out.

439
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:04,759
'Couldn't you get one and send it to me?'
said Ruth.

440
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:13,089
'Oh yes,' said the man, taking out a book.
'What name?'

441
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:19,579
Ruth looked at Denry, in the way that a woman
always looks at a man when she wants him to

442
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,700
pay.

443
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:29,700
'Rothschild,' said Denry. 'The millionaire.'

444
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:39,319
These words ended their engagement. The next
day Denry received by post a ring in a box,

445
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:40,990
with a short letter.

446
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:54,899
'I only said "Rothschild"!' said Denry to
himself. But secretly, he was pleased.

447
00:56:54,899 --> 00:56:55,899

448
00:56:55,899 --> 00:57:03,519
An hour later Denry met Cregeen, and was soon
the owner of the old Llandudno lifeboat. He

449
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:12,509
then went to find Simeon, an old sailor with
a white beard. He had been in the lifeboat

450
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:15,960
when they rescued the men on the Hjalmar.

451
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:23,650
'I've got the boat,' said Denry. 'I'll give
you two pounds for the week.'

452
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:32,859
'All right,' said the old man. 'And I've seen
three of those Norwegians. They don't speak

453
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:37,849
English, but they understand about the money.'

454
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:45,609
'Good,' said Denry. 'I'll see you tomorrow
morning.'

455
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:54,211
At five o'clock the next morning a boat left
Llandudno. There were six men rowing, three

456
00:57:54,211 --> 00:58:04,859
of them Norwegians. There was also a man with
a white beard, and Denry. In twenty minutes

457
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:12,680
they were at the wreck of the Hjalmar and
Denry was feeling very ill. Twenty minutes

458
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:19,099
more and he was happy to be back on land.

459
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:25,900
At ten o'clock that morning two Norwegian
sailors were walking around the town giving

460
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,339
little notices to everyone they met.

461
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:32,299
THE WRECK OF THE HJALMAR

462
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:36,180
FAMOUS RESCUE AT LLANDUDNO

463
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:46,640
Every day at 11, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 o'clock
the famous lifeboat which rescued the Norwegian

464
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:55,450
sailors will visit the wreck of the Hjalmar.
The lifeboat's captain is Simeon Edwards,

465
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:03,250
one of the rescuers, and the lifeboat is rowed
by three of the rescued Norwegians.

466
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:09,650
Return trip, 12 pence

467
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:20,130
On the first day, Denry made twelve pounds.
That evening he received a packet in the post.

468
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:28,680
It was from Nellie. There was a box of chocolates
and a note which said: Thank you very much

469
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:40,339
for the holiday. I hope you will like these.
Nellie. Denry was very pleased by this. Ruth's

470
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:46,229
young friend, he thought, was much more grateful
than Ruth herself.

471
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:56,509
The boat trips out to the wreck became more
and more popular. In the afternoons, Denry

472
00:59:56,509 --> 01:00:04,029
had to ask 25 pence - it was the only way
to stop the big crowds that were waiting on

473
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:14,059
the beach. Soon, he was making a hundred pounds
a week. He was sorry the wreck had happened

474
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:25,339
in August and not July. He was sorry there
were not two or even forty Hjalmars.

475
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:32,369
One day in September when business was beginning
to slow down (he was down to fifty pounds

476
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:42,170
a week), Denry had a very pleasant surprise.
He met Nellie on the beach, and it was a fact

477
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:49,960
that seeing her gave him a great feeling of
happiness. She was with her father, Councillor

478
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:57,779
Cotterill, and her mother. The Councillor
was a builder who had become rich building

479
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,319
cheap houses for the people of the Five Towns.

480
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:07,109
'Well, young man!' said Councillor Cotterill.

481
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:16,130
He continued to call Denry 'young man' in
a way that made Denry cross. 'I've made more

482
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:25,729
money this summer than you have in a year,'
he said silently to the Councillor's back.

483
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:34,650
'You must have dinner with me one evening,'
Denry said finally. 'At the Majestic.' The

484
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:43,789
Majestic was the finest, and most expensive,
hotel in Llandudno. Some of the waiters were

485
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:46,180
French!

486
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:54,420
They agreed to go the next day. Then Mrs Cotterill
remembered that Ruth was coming to stay with

487
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,859
them for a few days.

488
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:02,790
'Bring her along too!' said Denry.

489
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:10,430
The dinner was a great success. Denry had
never arranged a dinner before, but it was

490
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:19,209
easy. You just walked into the hotel in the
morning and said what you wanted. The hotel

491
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:26,770
arranged everything! And it was easy to meet
a woman who had just broken off her engagement

492
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:35,940
to you. You just said, 'Good afternoon, how
are you?' and she said the same. Then you

493
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:42,250
shook hands. And there you were, still alive.

494
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:51,599
After the meal, Denry walked back with the
others to their hotel. Councillor Cotterill

495
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:59,150
had stopped calling Denry 'young man'; he
now called him 'my boy'.

496
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:08,069
'That lifeboat. It was just an idea, my boy,
just an idea.'

497
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:13,049
'Yes,' said Denry, 'but I thought of it.'

498
01:03:13,049 --> 01:03:22,589
'The question is,' said the Councillor, 'can
you think of any more ideas as good?'

499
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:30,209
'Well,' said Denry, 'can you?'

500
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:37,099
When they reached the Cotterills' hotel, Ruth
waited a moment while the others went in,

501
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:39,800
and then turned to Denry:

502
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:48,279
'I don't feel like sleeping at all. I suppose
you wouldn't like to go for a walk?'

503
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:49,289
'Well...'

504
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:52,529
'I suppose you're very tired.'

505
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:59,880
'No,' he replied. 'It's this moonlight I'm
afraid of.'

506
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:09,950
A few days later the Cotterills and Ruth Earp
went home, and Denry went with them. He had

507
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:18,180
now sold the lifeboat and brought all his
business in Llandudno to an end. He had very

508
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:28,759
little luggage, but he did have a new hat-box.
It was very heavy.

509
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:35,959
When Denry got home, he was pleased to see
his mother again. She had often collected

510
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:43,759
his rents for him during the summer, and had
done it very well. He gave the hat-box to

511
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:47,269
her, and she immediately dropped it.

512
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:57,539
'I don't want any of your games, young man,'
she said crossly. 'What's in it?'

513
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:02,789
'Some pretty stones from the beach.'

514
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:12,069
She picked up the hat-box, opened it, and
screamed. It fell to the floor with a crash

515
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:20,650
and Mrs Machin was standing up to her ankles
in money. She could see coins running all

516
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:31,579
over the floor. At last they stopped moving,
and then it was silent. Denry could hear his

517
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:41,030
heart beating. For once in her life his mother
could not find a word to say.

518
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:50,280
For several days afterwards Mrs Machin was
still picking up coins. The story of the money

519
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:59,079
in the hat-box quickly went round the town.
It was Denry's 'latest' and people talked

520
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:08,910
about it for weeks afterwards.

521
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:15,140
CHAPTER FIVE
The Rescue of the Countess

522
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:22,180
Denry's rent-collecting business grew and
grew. He had come back from the Llandudno

523
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:31,109
adventure with a thousand pounds. Two years
later he had two thousand pounds, and his

524
01:06:31,109 --> 01:06:40,450
bank manager spoke to him with great politeness.
Denry now rented a small office, and employed

525
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,599
an office-boy.

526
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:53,500
He also bought a mule and cart. He said he
needed them for his work. He could, of course,

527
01:06:53,500 --> 01:07:02,249
collect rents on a bicycle, and a bicycle
doesn't eat much, or run away. But Denry wanted

528
01:07:02,249 --> 01:07:10,269
a mule. It was a good advertisement for his
business.

529
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:17,440
Denry was happy that people talked about the
mule as his 'latest', and he was happy to

530
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:27,779
be making money. But he wanted more than money.
He was always looking for new ideas, exciting

531
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:36,150
things to do - things which would make sure
that he was always the greatest 'card' in

532
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:40,109
the Five Towns.

533
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:46,079
One day, a new notice appeared on Denry's
door:

534
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,989
FIVE TOWNS SAVINGS CLUB

535
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:55,219
Secretary and Manager - E. H. Machin

536
01:07:55,219 --> 01:08:03,960
Many shops in the Five Towns had savings clubs.
Every week customers paid a few pence into

537
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:13,339
the club. At Christmas the customers could
spend all the money they had paid in. Denry's

538
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:23,600
idea was for a savings club for every shop
in the Five Towns. It was a fantastic idea.

539
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:33,089
A poor person could pay just a little money
every week, and to make it easier, Denry could

540
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:43,359
come to the house and collect the money. Denry's
savings club was special in one very important

541
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:53,440
way. After paying a pound to Denry, someone
could spend two pounds in the shops immediately

542
01:08:53,440 --> 01:09:02,799
- although they must then, of course, continue
to pay into the club every week.

543
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:10,509
Denry needed to make a profit, of course,
and his profit would come from the shops.

544
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:20,310
For every six pence spent in a shop, the shop
had to pay him one penny. He started by going

545
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:29,400
to Bostocks, the biggest clothes shop in the
Five Towns. With Bostocks' name on the list

546
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:39,699
it was easier to find other shops. In two
weeks he had nearly a hundred.

547
01:09:39,699 --> 01:09:48,549
Now he needed something to give the club a
good start. For twenty-five pounds Denry could

548
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:58,090
put an advertisement on the front page of
the Signal, but he preferred free advertisements.

549
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:08,329
Then he had an idea. He could ask the Countess
of Chell to be the patron of his club. Hers

550
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:16,000
was the best possible name to have at the
top of his letter paper. She was the richest

551
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:25,320
woman in the Five Towns. Some people loved
her and some people hated her, but everybody

552
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,520
knew her.

553
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:38,610
'I'll ask her. I'll have her as a patron,'
he said to himself. 'I'll go to Sneyd Hall.

554
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,290
She can't eat me.'

555
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:51,659
So one morning he arrived, without his mule,
at the home of the Countess of Chell. He had

556
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:59,340
been to Sneyd Hall before; the gardens were
open to the people of the Five Towns, and

557
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:07,130
there were often hundreds of people there
on Sunday afternoons in summer. But today

558
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,900
the gardens were empty.

559
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:19,560
It was a long walk between the trees up to
the house, and a long walk up the steps. Denry

560
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,000
rang, and the door opened.

561
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,230
'Well?' said a lady. She was dressed in black.

562
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:35,170
'Can I see the Countess?' he asked, giving
her his card.

563
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:45,360
'I will ask,' she answered. She disappeared
into the house, leaving Denry in the hall.

564
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,719
A few moments later he heard the Countess's
voice:

565
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:59,020
'Oh, no! I'm terribly busy. I'm leaving in
a few minutes.'

566
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:09,400
Still Denry waited. Nobody came to see him.
Minutes passed and still nothing. Had they

567
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:18,750
forgotten him? Then, through an open door
in the back of the house he saw a man. It

568
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:26,940
was Jock, the son of a friend of his mother.
Jock worked at Sneyd Hall, where he drove

569
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:31,090
the Countess's carriage.

570
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:41,420
Denry did not want to shout through the house,
so he walked towards him. 'Jock!' he called,

571
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,080
softly.

572
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:51,829
Jock didn't hear, and disappeared through
another door. Denry followed, through door

573
01:12:51,829 --> 01:13:00,260
after door, until suddenly he found himself
in a long ballroom, full of mirrors, paintings

574
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:11,530
and rich furniture, with high windows to one
side and big doors on the other. Jock had

575
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:19,340
disappeared. Denry tried the big doors, but
they were all locked. He went back to the

576
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:28,989
door he had used to come into the room. But
strangely, that was now locked as well. Then

577
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:37,790
he heard horses outside, and running to a
window, he saw the Countess's carriage driving

578
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,790
away.

579
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:50,599
Denry tried knocking on all the doors, first
politely, then noisily. He tried calling out,

580
01:13:50,599 --> 01:14:00,800
then shouting as loudly as he could. Nothing.
At last he realized that there was nobody

581
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:09,699
to hear him. He was a prisoner in an empty
house.

582
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:19,440
He looked around the room. The only possible
escape was to break a window, so Denry preferred

583
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:27,880
to wait until night. He spent a long afternoon
in the great ballroom of Sneyd Hall, looking

584
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:38,530
at pictures and furniture. When night fell,
he broke one of the big windows and went home.

585
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:45,420
The Five Towns Savings Club began life without
the Countess.

586
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:54,880
The next morning, Denry opened the Signal
and suddenly felt very ill.

587
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,429
ROBBERY AT SNEYD HALL

588
01:14:57,429 --> 01:15:09,230
Yesterday, thieves broke into the great ballroom
at Sneyd, home of the Countess of Chell. The

589
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:16,969
police say that nothing seems to be missing.
The Countess (who is away in Italy) will pay

590
01:15:16,969 --> 01:15:23,920
twenty pounds for any information about the
thieves.

591
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:31,800
Denry was lucky. The robbery was the talk
of the town for a few days, but nobody, it

592
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:39,570
seemed, had remembered his visit to Sneyd
Hall, or found his visiting card. And because

593
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:49,210
nothing was stolen, the police were not very
interested. Indeed, a week or two later, Denry

594
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:57,290
saw a chance to make something out of his
adventure. All that long afternoon he had

595
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:07,949
been in the great ballroom, and he had used
his eyes well. He remembered everything. Soon,

596
01:16:07,949 --> 01:16:15,300
a report appeared in the Signal under Denry's
name. It began:

597
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:21,610
The recent robbery at Sneyd Hall gives us
a reason to remember the beautiful paintings

598
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:30,230
and furniture which it contains and which,
happily, were not stolen. Only friends of

599
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:37,040
the family, of course, ever see the great
ballroom, but perhaps readers of the Signal

600
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:44,739
will be interested to read a description of
this fine room...

601
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:52,449
Everybody read the report of course, and everybody
understood that Denry, who had already danced

602
01:16:52,449 --> 01:17:01,320
with the Countess, was now a good friend of
the family.

603
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,320
***

604
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:11,710
The Savings Club was a great success; in fact,
it became too successful. The reason was this.

605
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:19,710
When customers had paid in two pounds, they
were allowed to spend four pounds in the shops.

606
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:28,090
They did spend four pounds in the shops. And
Denry had to pay the shops. Customers were

607
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:34,429
still paying in their five pence and their
ten pence - but that wasn't enough to help

608
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:44,540
Denry. His two thousand pounds in the bank
was going very quickly. And then a whisper

609
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:51,960
began to go round that Denry's famous Savings
Club was not healthy, that it was going to

610
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:57,699
fail, and that everyone would lose their money.

611
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:06,760
Denry knew that he had to do something - and
do it very quickly. He thought of the Countess.

612
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:15,190
The Countess was very good at opening things.
She opened hospitals and schools all over

613
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:22,429
the Five Towns, and Denry read in the Signal
that she was going to open a new Police Club

614
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:30,580
in Hanbridge in a week's time. There are a
number of facts about what happened on the

615
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:39,260
day of the opening, and during the week before
it. Some people may have ideas to explain

616
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,199
some of these facts.

617
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:52,800
The facts are these. First: Denry called one
day at the house of Mrs Kemp in Brougham Street.

618
01:18:52,800 --> 01:19:01,330
Mrs Kemp was the mother of Jock, Denry's old
friend and carriage-driver to the Countess.

619
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:11,840
Second: a day or two later, Jock came to visit
his mother, and Denry also came to visit.

620
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:20,130
Denry and Jock went for a short walk together.
Third: on the afternoon of the opening of

621
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:27,449
the Police Club, the Countess's carriage broke
a wheel between Sneyd Hall and Hanbridge,

622
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:36,599
about five kilometres from Hanbridge. Fourth:
about five minutes later, Denry drove past

623
01:19:36,599 --> 01:19:47,570
in his mule cart, wearing his best clothes.
Fifth: as Denry drove past, Jock called out,

624
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:55,360
'Excuse me, sir!' and Denry stopped. These
are the facts.

625
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,730
'Good afternoon, Countess,' said Denry, lifting
his hat.

626
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:06,870
'Oh, it's you, is it?' said the Countess.
'Good afternoon.'

627
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:14,139
'I see you've had an accident,' said Denry.
'Are you going somewhere important?'

628
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:22,510
'Yes, I am going somewhere important! I've
got to be at the Police Club by three. And

629
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:26,380
I shan't be. I'm late now.'

630
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:33,159
'I can get you there by three o'clock,' said
Denry.

631
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:40,679
It was five kilometres to Hanbridge, and they
were there in seventeen minutes. The mule

632
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:49,670
was moving as fast as he could, but when they
came into the main square, he stopped suddenly.

633
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:56,409
There were several hundred policemen outside
the Police Club, waiting for the Countess.

634
01:20:56,409 --> 01:21:03,159
'Oh dear!' said Denry. 'He hates policemen.'

635
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,920
'I'll walk,' said the Countess.

636
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:15,020
'Oh no,' said Denry. 'It's all right.' He
hit the mule over the head with his whip.

637
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:23,760
The mule dashed off, but away from the Police
Club. They hit another cart, full of vegetables,

638
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:33,280
and turned it over. They dashed down a hill,
fast. Then the Countess noticed that Denry

639
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,000
was not using his right arm.

640
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,690
'I think I broke it when we hit the cart,'
he said. 'Don't worry. I'll go up this hill

641
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:47,860
- that'll stop him.'

642
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:55,150
Denry managed to turn the mule into Birches
Street, which went up a hill. The mule slowed

643
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,210
down, then stopped.

644
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:06,190
'Shall I drive him to the Club?' asked the
Countess. She could see that Denry's arm was

645
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:09,280
very painful.

646
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:18,500
And so the Countess arrived at the Police
Club in Denry's mule cart. And she invited

647
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:25,559
Denry to the Club opening, where she told
the five mayors and all the important people

648
01:22:25,559 --> 01:22:32,550
of the Five Towns how Denry had rescued her.

649
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:39,810
After the opening, Denry left the Club with
the Countess, to help her find her carriage.

650
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:42,570
But it still had not arrived.

651
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:48,160
'I can take you home in my cart,' offered
Denry.

652
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:53,179
'I think I'll wait,' said the Countess.

653
01:22:53,179 --> 01:22:59,790
'Well, let's go and have a cup of tea while
we're waiting,' said Denry. 'There's a good

654
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,490
tea-shop near here.'

655
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:12,099
The Countess loved tea, and they were soon
sitting in a corner of the tea-shop. The Countess

656
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:14,680
looked hard at Denry.

657
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:22,869
'How did you get all that information about
the rooms at Sneyd Hall?' she asked.

658
01:23:22,869 --> 01:23:29,420
After this, the conversation became exciting.

659
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:36,059
That evening a notice appeared in the Signal
which said that the Countess was now Patron

660
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:46,750
of the Five Towns Savings Club. In a few days
a thousand more people had joined the Club.

661
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:54,520
Denry had no more worries about money.

662
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:00,130
CHAPTER SIX
The Battle with Denry's Mother

663
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:06,070
Late one winter's evening a few years later,
Denry opened the door of his mother's house

664
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,570
in Brougham Street.

665
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:13,930
'Is that you, Denry?' came a tired voice.

666
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:19,010
'Yes,' he said, walking into the living room.

667
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:26,110
His mother was sitting very near the fire,
which was burning brightly. She looked cold

668
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,699
and ill.

669
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:31,280
'You must see a doctor, mother.'

670
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:38,960
'A doctor! What for? I've just got a bit of
a cold, that's all.'

671
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:45,949
'You've been ill a lot this winter,' said
Denry. 'It's this awful old house we live

672
01:24:45,949 --> 01:24:47,750
in.'

673
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:56,800
'It's a very good house. It was good enough
for your father and it's good enough for me.'

674
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:04,880
'Mother, I'm earning two thousand pounds a
year! And here we are, living in an old house

675
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,449
at a rent of twenty-three pence a week!'

676
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:16,690
Actually, Denry was making nearly four thousand
a year, but he was afraid to tell his mother

677
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:25,369
that. These days he was a great man in the
Five Towns, but his greatness was nothing

678
01:25:25,369 --> 01:25:26,900
in Brougham Street.

679
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:36,530
'You can go and live in a fine, grand house
if you like, Denry,' said his mother. 'But

680
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:40,489
I'm staying here.'

681
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:47,340
And so the battle went on. Denry wanted to
move, but his mother refused to leave Brougham

682
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:55,199
Street. And Denry wouldn't move to a new house
without her.

683
01:25:55,199 --> 01:26:02,030
One morning a few weeks later, there was a
letter for Mrs Machin from the man who owned

684
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:11,290
her house. He had sold the house, he wrote,
to a man in London, a Mr Wilbraham. From next

685
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:17,130
month Mrs Machin must pay her rent to him.

686
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:22,260
The next day Denry came home with some news.

687
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:30,179
'I've met Mr Wilbraham, the man who bought
our house. He came down from London. He wants

688
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:33,240
me to collect the rents for him.'

689
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,030
'What did you tell him?'

690
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:46,110
'I said yes. Why not? It's easier for you.
And he's an interesting man. He's building

691
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:54,250
a new house up at Bleakridge. It's going to
be a really modern house; a house where you

692
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:59,179
can live comfortably without servants.'

693
01:26:59,179 --> 01:27:07,579
'He's certainly a sensible man,' answered
Mrs Machin. She hated servants and said so

694
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:11,590
about once a week.

695
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:19,719
The house at Bleakridge started to grow. Mr
Wilbraham stayed in London. The builder was

696
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:27,210
Mr Cotterill (Denry had been friendly with
the family since Llandudno), but Denry also

697
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:34,949
kept an eye on things. The house was nearly
finished when Mrs Machin got a second letter

698
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:37,329
from Mr Wilbraham.

699
01:27:37,329 --> 01:27:49,159
'He says we have to leave,' she cried. 'He
wants us out immediately. Oh Denry, what shall

700
01:27:49,159 --> 01:27:50,610
we do!'

701
01:27:50,610 --> 01:28:00,230
'We'll go and see him,' said Denry. 'He's
coming to his new house tonight!'

702
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:07,560
So they put on their best clothes and went
up to Bleakridge. Half an hour later they

703
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:16,360
were standing outside Mr Wilbraham's house.
Denry rang the bell, and they waited.

704
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:26,020
'Dirty doorstep,' said Mrs Machin, looking
down at it. In Brougham Street it was important

705
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:33,060
to have a clean doorstep, even if your rent
was only twenty-three pence a week.

706
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:43,110
'Easy to clean,' said Denry. 'Watch!' He turned
a tap next to the doorstep, and water ran

707
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:45,730
over the step, washing it.

708
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:51,330
'Is that hot water?' asked Mrs Machin.

709
01:28:51,330 --> 01:29:00,760
'Of course,' said Denry. He could see his
mother liked the tap. 'Wilbraham's fixed a

710
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,130
lot of things like that in his house.'

711
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:13,590
He rang again but there was no answer. 'Perhaps
his train's late. I've got a key. We'll go

712
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:23,430
in and wait for him.' He opened the door and
turned on the electric light. Mrs Machin had

713
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:30,730
never seen electric light before. She thought
it was wonderful.

714
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:34,329
'It's very warm in here,' she said.

715
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:42,580
'Central heating,' said Denry. 'No fires to
light, no wood to carry, no fireplaces to

716
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,679
clean-'

717
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:46,380
The doorbell rang.

718
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:53,000
'There he is!' said Denry, moving to the door.

719
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:01,469
Three people stood on the washed doorstep
- Mr and Mrs Cotterill, and Nellie. Mr Wilbraham

720
01:30:01,469 --> 01:30:04,750
had invited them, said Mr Cotterill.

721
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:14,940
'Oh, come in, come in!' said Denry. 'He's
not here. Perhaps he's missed his train. But

722
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:23,020
the house is all ready for him. Come on, I'll
show you round.'

723
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:30,300
He and Nellie ran upstairs and the others
followed. Upstairs the house was as wonderful

724
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:41,190
as downstairs. So easy to clean. No work at
all. 'Why,' said Mrs Cotterill, 'I could live

725
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:48,880
here without any servants and still have it
clean and tidy by ten o'clock in the morning.'

726
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,040
Mrs Machin agreed.

727
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,310
Downstairs they found a fine cold supper ready
to eat.

728
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:05,139
'Come on,' said Denry. 'Let's eat. I'm sure
he'd like us to.'

729
01:31:05,139 --> 01:31:14,369
Mrs Machin didn't want to. 'It's very strange
that he isn't here,' she said.

730
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:19,420
'He's a strange man,' said Denry. 'I think
he's a little mad.'

731
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:32,120
'I don't think he can be mad,' said Mrs Machin.
'The house is much too sensible for a madman.'

732
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:41,150
Finally, they all sat down to supper, and
after some food and three bottles of wine

733
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:48,370
they started to enjoy themselves. Soon Denry
was searching the house for a fourth bottle

734
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:56,940
of wine. He found one, opened it, drank some,
and, with a cry, dropped the glass on the

735
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:00,750
floor, where it broke.

736
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:08,600
It was not wine. It was a bottle of cleaning
liquid. And the word POISON was written on

737
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:19,679
it in large letters. Nellie didn't seem to
realize how serious it was, and began to laugh.

738
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:28,090
Mrs Machin took Denry's arm. 'Come out to
the kitchen,' she said. 'You must have some

739
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,599
salt water, to make you sick.'

740
01:32:31,599 --> 01:32:37,150
'Oh no!' said Denry. 'I'll be all right.'

741
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:44,540
But his mother wouldn't listen to him, and
pulled him out of the room. Nellie had her

742
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:53,059
hand over her mouth, trying very hard not
to laugh, but not succeeding.

743
01:32:53,059 --> 01:33:02,920
Ten minutes later they returned. Denry looked
very white, and very cross. 'There's no danger

744
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:07,199
now,' said Mrs Machin.

745
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:13,809
So the party came to an end. The Cotterills
stood up to leave, and asked Denry how he

746
01:33:13,809 --> 01:33:14,860
was feeling.

747
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:24,880
'I feel much too ill to walk home,' he said.
'I'll sleep here. The bedrooms are all ready.

748
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,030
My mother can stay too.'

749
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:37,219
The Cotterills left and Denry went to bed.
After an hour his mother went to bed, too,

750
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:41,449
but she slept very badly.

751
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:49,420
The next morning she was up before Denry and
went out. Half an hour later she was back,

752
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:51,619
waking Denry up.

753
01:33:51,619 --> 01:34:01,090
'Oh, Denry! I've just been back home. They're
pulling the house down. The roof's gone and

754
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:05,340
the furniture...'

755
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,080
Denry sat up.

756
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:13,460
'I'll tell you something now,' he said. 'Wilbraham's
dead.'

757
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,239
'Dead!'

758
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:24,010
'Dead. Well, he was never really alive, of
course.'

759
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:32,070
And Mrs Machin understood. This was all Denry's
plan to move her out of Brougham Street and

760
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:41,580
up to Bleakridge. Soon all Bursley knew that
Denry had won the battle with his mother.

761
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:44,380
And they loved it.

762
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:52,659
But at least Mrs Machin had won with the salt
water.

763
01:34:52,659 --> 01:34:59,539
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Mayor, the Wife and the Football Club

764
01:34:59,539 --> 01:35:07,300
Soon after the move to Bleakridge, Bursley
made Denry a Town Councillor. He was the youngest

765
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:14,559
Councillor in the town, and one of the richest
men in the Five Towns, but Councillor Cotterill

766
01:35:14,559 --> 01:35:20,010
still called him 'young man'.

767
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:28,050
Denry did not like Councillor Cotterill, but
he was very friendly with Nellie and her mother.

768
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:34,820
So when he bought one of the first cars in
the Five Towns, he decided to invite them

769
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:41,090
to go for a drive. When he got there, Nellie
came to the door.

770
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:48,750
'Come in,' she said. 'I've got a surprise
for you.'

771
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:56,159
In the sitting room, next to Mrs Cotterill,
Denry saw a wonderful woman, beautifully dressed

772
01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:07,520
in black. When she turned to look at him,
Denry suddenly recognized her. It was Ruth.

773
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:15,809
Then he remembered that Ruth had married a
rich man, a Mr Capron-Smith, who had recently

774
01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:17,340
died.

775
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:23,989
'Well, Denry,' she said, softly.

776
01:36:23,989 --> 01:36:27,520
'Well, Ruth.'

777
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:34,659
Conversation was not difficult. Ruth was talking
about a holiday in Switzerland. Denry listened

778
01:36:34,659 --> 01:36:38,079
with interest.

779
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:45,719
After a few minutes, the front door opened,
and Mr Cotterill was heard in the hall. He

780
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:52,500
did not come into the sitting room, so Mrs
Cotterill went out to speak to him. When she

781
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:57,300
came back, she was crying.

782
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:07,119
'It's the bank!' she cried. 'After all these
years, and now, suddenly... all his money...'

783
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:17,349
Nellie and Ruth ran to her, and Denry decided
it was probably better to leave. But as he

784
01:37:17,349 --> 01:37:24,809
walked into the hall, he met Councillor Cotterill.
He was looking very worried.

785
01:37:24,809 --> 01:37:34,421
'Ah, Denry,' he said. 'You're a friend of
the family. We've no secrets from you. I'm

786
01:37:34,421 --> 01:37:43,849
afraid things are looking bad. The fact is,
the bank wants its money and I can't pay.'

787
01:37:43,849 --> 01:37:48,900
'What are you going to do?' asked Denry.

788
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:56,530
'We'll all go to Canada. My brother lives
there - he's in the building business. He'll

789
01:37:56,530 --> 01:38:05,580
give me a job. It's stupid really. I only
need two thousand pounds, for a month or two,

790
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:15,260
until I sell the houses I'm building. I say,'
he continued, 'you don't have a thousand or

791
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:23,739
two, do you, young man? There'll be an excellent
profit in two or three months. You and I have

792
01:38:23,739 --> 01:38:26,960
been friends for ten years.'

793
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:35,369
'And I suppose I've come to visit you once
a fortnight,' answered Denry. 'Perhaps two

794
01:38:35,369 --> 01:38:43,139
hundred and fifty times in ten years. That's
eight pounds a visit, Cotterill. That's more

795
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:49,329
expensive than the most fashionable doctor
in England!'

796
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:57,409
This conversation does not make Denry look
very kind. But Councillor Cotterill had called

797
01:38:57,409 --> 01:39:03,360
him 'young man' too many times.

798
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:09,550
Several weeks later the Cotterills left Bursley
and took the train to Liverpool, where they

799
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:17,320
would take the ship to Canada. On the day
they left the Five Towns, Denry happened to

800
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:21,160
meet Ruth in the street.

801
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:28,320
'Did you know they have the cheapest tickets
for the ship?' she said. 'It's terrible! And

802
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,170
it's too late to change them now.'

803
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:39,670
'No, it isn't,' said Denry. 'I could go to
Liverpool and arrange it. The ship doesn't

804
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:41,110
leave until tomorrow.'

805
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:51,020
'Let's both go!' she said. 'And we'll pay
half each for their new tickets.'

806
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:58,770
They had a very pleasant train journey. Ruth
was warm and friendly to Denry, and as the

807
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:06,940
train pulled into Liverpool, he had a very
strange thought. 'I could still marry her!

808
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:13,900
She's a fine woman, and now she's rich herself...'

809
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:19,039
They found the Cotterills, and paid for them
to travel in a more comfortable part of the

810
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:28,039
ship. Mr Cotterill said he would repay them,
Mrs Cotterill cried, and Nellie said nothing

811
01:40:28,039 --> 01:40:37,659
at all. The ship's bell rang for the second
time. Denry and Ruth said their goodbyes and

812
01:40:37,659 --> 01:40:41,090
started to leave.

813
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:49,809
Then Denry looked back and saw Nellie's sad
little face. He felt as he had never felt

814
01:40:49,809 --> 01:41:00,349
before in his life. He wondered what was happening
to his legs. He turned and ran back to Nellie.

815
01:41:00,349 --> 01:41:07,469
'Look here,' he whispered. 'Come with me for
a moment. There's something I want to give

816
01:41:07,469 --> 01:41:12,869
you. I left it in the taxi.'

817
01:41:12,869 --> 01:41:17,060
Ruth was already lost in the crowds of people
leaving the ship.

818
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:20,980
'But there's not time. The bell-'

819
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:28,849
'It'll only take a minute. Quick.' Without
waiting to argue, he took her hand, pulled

820
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:31,381
her off the ship, and towards a taxi.

821
01:41:31,381 --> 01:41:36,159
'Which taxi is yours?' asked Nellie.

822
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:43,480
'Any one. It doesn't matter. Jump in.' He
pushed her in.

823
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,719
'I'll miss the boat.'

824
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:51,020
'I know you will. I don't want you to go to
Canada.'

825
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:57,980
'What are you going to do with me?' whispered
Nellie.

826
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:10,780
'Well, what do you think?' shouted Denry.
'I'm going to marry you, of course!'

827
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:11,780
***

828
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:17,659
One evening Councillor Denry Machin sat down
to tea with his wife, Nellie, in the house

829
01:42:17,659 --> 01:42:27,010
in Bleakridge. He opened the newspaper and
read aloud: Sudden Death of Councillor Bloor.

830
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:33,520
'Poor man!' said Nellie. 'And he was going
to be mayor in November, wasn't he?'

831
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:38,010
'So he was,' said Denry.

832
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:41,699
'Who'll be mayor now?'

833
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:45,199
'Barlow, I suppose,' said Denry.

834
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:54,489
'Barlow! He's an awful man! Nobody likes Barlow.
Why don't they make you mayor?'

835
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:57,460
'Would you like to be mayoress?'

836
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:01,630
'I don't know. Why not?'

837
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:09,530
'I probably will be mayor after Barlow. But
I want to be the youngest mayor, which means

838
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:13,750
I'll have to do it this year, while I'm still
thirty-three.'

839
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:15,920
'Who decides?'

840
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:25,460
'The Council, of course. But you're right.
Nobody likes Barlow. And he's having a lot

841
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:32,760
of problems with the Football Club. He's the
chairman, you know.'

842
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:40,820
Bursley Football Club was having a very bad
year. In fact it had had several very bad

843
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:49,989
years. It lost most of its games, and because
not many people wanted to see Bursley lose,

844
01:43:49,989 --> 01:43:54,820
few people went to watch the games.

845
01:43:54,820 --> 01:44:00,710
A few days after Denry's conversation with
Nellie there was a crowded meeting at the

846
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:08,929
Town Hall to discuss the club's future. Barlow,
the chairman, got up to speak.

847
01:44:08,929 --> 01:44:17,880
'I've been chairman of this club for thirteen
years. In that time I've put two thousand

848
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:28,219
pounds of my own money into the club. I can't
put in any more. But what have you, the people

849
01:44:28,219 --> 01:44:37,500
of Bursley, done for your club? You don't
come and watch. If we lose a game you stay

850
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:48,370
at home the next week. We lose fifty or sixty
pounds every time we play, and we can't go

851
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:52,480
on like this.'

852
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:59,870
Several other people stood up to speak. Most
of them had nothing kind to say about Councillor

853
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:05,530
Barlow. All of them said that the club needed
new players.

854
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:15,590
'New players!' said Barlow. 'Where's the money
for new players? Has anybody got a thousand

855
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:18,940
pounds?'

856
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:27,550
Nobody offered money. But more speakers stood
up to ask for new players. Finally a man at

857
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:33,380
the back of the hall stood up and walked up
to the front.

858
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:40,460
'It's Machin!' said somebody. 'Good old Machin!'

859
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,139
Denry turned and looked at the sea of faces.

860
01:45:44,139 --> 01:45:54,060
'I don't know a lot about football,' he said,
'although I enjoy a good game. But I do want

861
01:45:54,060 --> 01:46:02,020
to say something about new players. Isn't
it true that one of the best players in England

862
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:04,079
comes from Bursley?'

863
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:13,010
'Yes!' shouted the crowd. 'Callear! He's the
best player in England!'

864
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:22,440
'That's right. Callear. He left Bursley when
he was nineteen to play for Liverpool. He

865
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:31,369
scored a lot of goals there in three years.
Then he went to York, didn't he? And York

866
01:46:31,369 --> 01:46:40,760
have some money problems now, I hear, and
want to sell some of their players. Gentlemen,

867
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:45,949
Callear must come back home to Bursley.'

868
01:46:45,949 --> 01:46:54,469
The crowd in the hall were now very noisy
and excited. Barlow jumped angrily to his

869
01:46:54,469 --> 01:46:55,469
feet.

870
01:46:55,469 --> 01:47:05,679
'And how are we going to get Callear? Councillor
Machin says he doesn't know much about football,

871
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:18,230
and it's true! Aston Villa have already offered
700 pounds for Callear. Blackburn have offered

872
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:26,380
750 pounds. Has anybody here got 800 pounds?'

873
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:34,110
'Have you finished?' asked Denry, who was
still standing.

874
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:38,010
The hall exploded with laughter.

875
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:48,909
'Now,' called Denry, 'Mr Callear, will you
please come up to the front of the hall?'

876
01:47:48,909 --> 01:47:56,219
The hall was suddenly silent. A tall young
man walked nervously down to the front of

877
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:57,650
the hall.

878
01:47:57,650 --> 01:48:08,170
'That's him!' said somebody. 'It's Callear.
Good old Callear! Good old Machin!'

879
01:48:08,170 --> 01:48:16,760
'Well?' asked Denry, turning to Barlow. 'Do
you want him?'

880
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,690
'Yes. But what about the money?'

881
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:33,070
'That's my problem. I've just come back from
York. If you want him, you can have him.'

882
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:42,670
Two days later a letter appeared in the Signal.
It said that Denry should be the next mayor.

883
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:50,040
Other letters followed, saying the same thing,
and that Bursley needed a young and popular

884
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:57,699
mayor. And when the Council met, it agreed.

885
01:48:57,699 --> 01:49:05,770
That evening Denry told Nellie: 'You'll be
the mayoress to the youngest mayor. And it's

886
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:16,969
cost me, with hotels and travel, about eight
hundred and eleven pounds!'

887
01:49:16,969 --> 01:49:22,420
After the meeting a group of councillors were
talking about Denry.

888
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:26,920
'What a card!' said one, laughing.

889
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:35,869
'There's never been a man like him in all
the Five Towns!' said another.

890
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:44,330
'But he's never done a day's work in his life,'
said Barlow. 'What's he done for the town?'

891
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:51,290
'What's he done? He's made us all laugh! That's
what he's done.'

892
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:52,449
- THE END -
