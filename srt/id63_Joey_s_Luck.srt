1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:01,840
Joey's Luck!

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:11,520
Joey Kerrigan arrived in London in January 
1912. He did not have a place to stay.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:21,920
'It doesn't matter,' he thought, smiling. 
'Joey's luck is going to find me a room.'

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
Joey thought a lot about luck.  

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:38,240
'One day I'm going to be rich,' he told 
everybody. 'Lucky people get rich, and I'm lucky.'

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,320
After a lot of walking, he found a room in 
a house. It was near Tower Bridge. The room  

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:58,400
wasn't very big but it was cheap. The landlord's 
name was Mr Webber. He looked Joey up and down.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,840
'What's your name?' he said. 'Where are you from?'

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,720
'Joe. Joe... Smith,' Joe said. 'I'm from Ireland.'

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:25,840
'Well, you can have the room,' Webber 
said, 'but I want two weeks' money now.'

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
'I've only got one week's money,' Joey said.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,520
'And tomorrow's Sunday,' Webber said.  

13
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,880
'You can't find work on a Sunday. So when 
can you give me the second week's money?'

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:54,480
Joey smiled with his mouth but not his eyes. 
'I can find work,' he said. 'I'm lucky.  

15
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,760
Good things happen to me. 
It's called Joey's luck.'

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,840
On Sunday, Joey stayed in bed 
all morning and in the afternoon,  

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,040
he went for a walk. After an hour, he 
took a bag from a woman in Fleet Street.

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
The woman shouted, 'Stop! Stop!'

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,440
But Joey was now fifty metres away, 
and there were no other people near.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,720
Joey laughed and ran down a little street, then 
between two tall buildings down to the river.

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,080
He stopped and opened the bag. There 
was some money in it, but not very much.  

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,200
He took the money out, then 
put the bag into the river.

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Later that day, he walked past a 
bookshop. There were lots of people there,  

24
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,240
looking at books, and Joey 
moved carefully between them.  

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:10,160
For a second he stood behind a fat man, 
then moved quietly away. The man did not  

26
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:18,560
feel Joey's hand in his back pocket, but the 
man's wallet was now inside Joey's shirt.

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,400
It was a big, fat wallet,  

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:32,080
and when he got back to the house, he gave the 
landlord the second week's money for the room.

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,200
'You found work on a Sunday?' 
Webber said. 'Where? Who with?'

30
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,680
Joey smiled. 'I told you, I'm lucky. Joey's luck!'

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,600
For the next three months, Joey Kerrigan 
walked the streets of London most days.  

32
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,760
He stole handbags from women, or things from 
shops, and he took wallets from men's pockets.  

33
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,240
One morning at the beginning of April, he 
took a wallet from the pocket of an old man  

34
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:21,280
with a red face. Joey was usually a very good 
pickpocket - people never knew anything about it.

35
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:31,360
But not that morning. The man with the red face 
was quick. He turned, saw Joey, and shouted.

36
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,480
'Hey! You! That's my wallet! Come back here!'

37
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,560
But Joey was a good runner too. In two seconds, 
he was round the corner into another street,  

38
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,160
then round another corner, 
and then he jumped onto a bus.

39
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,760
'Joey's luck!' Joey said, laughing.

40
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,200
There was more luck for Joey that week.

41
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,520
He first learned about Theo Goldman's 
money in a pub near his landlord's house.  

42
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,160
Webber went to the pub most evenings 
and sat with his friend, Goldman.

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Goldman had a shop not far from the pub. He bought 
and sold a lot of different things - tables,  

44
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,840
chairs, beds, clocks, watches, books, pictures...

45
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,600
When Joey went into the pub that evening, 
he saw Webber and Goldman at a table  

46
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,240
near the window. There were a lot of people in 
the pub. Joey bought a drink, then found a chair  

47
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:03,600
near Webber and Goldman. They did not see him. 
Joey sat with his back to them, and listened.

48
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,000
'But I need money to buy things when 
people bring them in,' Goldman said.

49
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:27,360
'Some money, yes,' Webber answered. 'But a hundred 
pounds or more? And in the shop? No, no, Theo!'

50
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,920
'It's not in the shop,' Goldman 
said. 'It's in my room at the back.'

51
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,200
'Do you have a good place to put it?' Webber said.

52
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,840
Goldman laughed. 'A very good place,' he said.

53
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,240
Joey sat with his drink, 
thinking. He knew Goldman's shop  

54
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,680
because it was in the same street as 
Webber's house. Joey often walked past it.

55
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,680
A hundred pounds or more. 'I'm 
going to get that hundred pounds!'  

56
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,800
he thought. 'Then I can do anything! 
Perhaps begin a new life in America!'

57
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,760
He smiled. Joey's luck again!

58
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:39,120
So the money was in the room at the back, in 
a very good place. But where was that place?

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,960
The next morning Joey walked slowly 
past Goldman's shop. He did not go in,  

60
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:57,840
but looked through the window. The old man 
was in the shop, but he did not see Joey.

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Joey saw an open door to the room at 
the back of the shop. Through the door,  

62
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:15,600
he could see a table, two chairs, and a big 
cupboard. Was Goldman's money in that cupboard?

63
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,320
Suddenly, the old man looked up, and 
Joey quickly turned and walked away.

64
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,480
He did not go to bed that night.  

65
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:40,480
He put all his things into a bag, sat in an 
armchair and waited. Midnight came, and went.  

66
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,080
At two o'clock in the morning, he went 
down the stairs and out of the house.

67
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,840
It was a cold night and Joey 
looked up at the moon in the sky.

68
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,600
'Are you a lucky moon?' he said, 
smiling. 'Joey's lucky moon?'

69
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,840
He walked to Goldman's shop and looked round.  

70
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,160
Nobody was in the street. He took 
a small hammer from his coat pocket  

71
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,840
and broke the glass in the shop door. Then 
he put his hand through and opened the door.

72
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:31,280
Joey moved quickly into the shop. He closed the 
door behind him and put his bag on the floor.  

73
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:41,520
Then he walked quietly across the shop to the door 
into the back room, opened it, and went through.  

74
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,840
It was dark, but moonlight came through the 
window, and Joey could see the big cupboard.

75
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,040
The little hammer soon opened the cupboard.  

76
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,840
There were a lot of books and papers inside; 
some of the papers fell out on to the floor.

77
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,160
'Who's there?'

78
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:17,440
Joey did not move. Only his eyes moved, 
looking around the room. Then a door at the  

79
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:25,280
back of the room opened, and Theo Goldman 
came in with an oil lamp. He saw Joey.

80
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
'What -!' he began.

81
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,960
Joey jumped across the room, 
grabbed the old man's arm,  

82
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,560
and pulled it up behind his back. Then he 
held the hammer in front of Goldman's face.

83
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,160
'Where's the money?' he said. 'Tell me!'

84
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,880
'M-money?' Goldman said. 'What - 
what money? There isn't any money.'

85
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
'Yes, there is,' Joey said.  

86
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,000
'You told Webber about it in the pub. 
A hundred pounds or more. Where is it?'

87
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
Goldman said nothing.

88
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,160
'Tell me,' Joey said, 'or 
I'm going to break your arms!  

89
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,400
First one arm, and then the 
other one. Where is it?'

90
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,640
Goldman tried to pull his arm away. He made 
small angry noises, but no words came out.

91
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,720
Joey held the hammer in front of Goldman's eyes. 
'Tell me! Or this hammer goes into your face!'

92
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:55,840
'All right! All right! It - it's under the 
floor,' Goldman said. 'Under the cupboard.'

93
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,600
Joey pushed the old man across to the 
cupboard. 'Get it,' he said. 'Now!'

94
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,680
The old man put the oil lamp on the floor 
and pulled the cupboard away from the wall.  

95
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,280
Then he got between the cupboard and the wall  

96
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,840
and pulled up some of the floor. There was a 
small box under the floor and Goldman got it out.

97
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Joey grabbed the box from the old man's 
hands, and opened it. It was full of money.

98
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
Joey smiled.

99
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:46,960
'I know you!' Goldman said suddenly. 
'You live at Albert Webber's house!'

100
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
'Albert who?' said Joey. 'Don't know him.'

101
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,560
He began to take the money out of the box 
and push it into the pockets of his coat.

102
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,760
'Yes, you do! You live in his house,' Goldman 
said. 'Albert told me about you. You're -'

103
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:21,120
'Be quiet!' Joey said. 'All right, so you 
know me. But nobody's going to find me.'  

104
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,600
He laughed. 'I can get a long 
way away with this money.'

105
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:37,040
All the money from Goldman's box was now in 
Joey's pockets. He gave Goldman a little push.  

106
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:48,320
'Now, get back in your bedroom and stay there.' 
He pushed him again. 'Go on! Get moving!'

107
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,600
The old man began to walk across the 
room with the oil lamp. Suddenly,  

108
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
he turned and hit Joey on the head with the lamp.

109
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,560
'Aaagh!' cried Joey.

110
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,520
The lamp broke and fell on the floor, 
next to the papers from the cupboard.  

111
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
The oil from the lamp ran across the 
floor, carrying the flames to the papers.

112
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Goldman tried to run into the shop but Joey jumped 
on him and the two of them fell to the floor.  

113
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,160
The old man's head hit the wall. 
After that, he did not move.

114
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
Joey heard the noise of the 
flames before he saw them.  

115
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:48,560
He looked behind him. The flames were big, and 
were already halfway up the legs of a table.

116
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,840
Joey jumped to his feet and ran through the shop.  

117
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,280
He found his bag by the front door, went 
out into the street and began to run again.  

118
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,120
At the end of the street, 
he stopped and looked back.

119
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,280
There were now flames in the shop window, 
and black smoke came from the shop door.  

120
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,320
He thought about the old man on the floor 
in the back room - but only for a second.

121
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Then he turned and ran again.

122
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:41,440
Two days later, on Wednesday 10th April, 1912, 
Joey was in Southampton, with thousands of other  

123
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:52,240
people. They came to see the new ship there - the 
biggest and fastest ship in the world. It was the  

124
00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:01,360
day of its first voyage across the Atlantic to 
New York, carrying more than two thousand people.

125
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
Some of the people in Southampton that day  

126
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,560
were the ship's passengers. Some of them 
just came to look at the wonderful new ship.

127
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,800
And there it was! Joey was a happy young man.  

128
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:31,680
He was a passenger, with a ticket in his pocket - 
a ticket to New York! Life was good, he thought.

129
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
'Joey's luck got me the money for my ticket!'  

130
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:49,840
he said, laughing. 'And Joey's luck is taking 
me to America. This is the end of my old life!'

131
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:59,360
And he walked onto the Titanic.
 
 
 
 

132
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,007
- THE END -
