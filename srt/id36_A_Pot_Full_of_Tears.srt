1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:19,490
Luck comes and goes like a thief in the night,
here one minute, gone the next.

2
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:28,510
Some women want children but can't have them;
others have children but can't keep them.

3
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:35,440
Some babies are born into loving families;
others never sleep in their own mother's arms,

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,910
and never know their father's name.

5
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,850
And in the end, which of them is lucky, and
which unlucky?

6
00:00:47,850 --> 00:01:06,280
Who can say?

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,039
The wind whispers through the walls of the
little wooden house, blowing the flame of

8
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,220
the smoky lamp from side to side.

9
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:27,369
An old man sits, resting his arms on his legs,
looking down at the wooden floor.

10
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:31,360
How long will it be, he thinks.

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,470
The end must come soon, it must.

12
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,720
Across the room from him sits a woman.

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,560
She is a stranger and does not belong in this
house.

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:56,829
Everything about her is different - she looks
different, she sounds different, she smells

15
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,240
different.

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,200
She has sat here in this poor little house
for seven hours, but still the wind carries

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,470
her expensive perfume, a smell from another
world.

18
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:22,829
She and the old man are different in every
way, but she, too, sits on an old wooden chair,

19
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,350
looking down at the wooden floor.

20
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,190
How long will it be, she thinks.

21
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,850
The end must come soon, it must.

22
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,000
Sometimes they hear a cry from the other room.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,230
Each time, the old man feels that cry all
through his body, a father feeling a child's

24
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,660
pain.

25
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:59,440
A loud scream brings both the old man and
woman stranger to their feet.

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
They wait.

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:13,130
Minutes later, an old woman comes through
the door, holding a baby in a blanket.

28
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,540
The blanket is new, brought by the woman stranger.

29
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,070
She now takes the baby from the old woman,
but she does not move the blanket to look

30
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,260
at the baby's face.

31
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,769
She is not interested in that.

32
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:39,020
She leaves the house without even a goodbye
to the old man.

33
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,440
It is months before.

34
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,540
Before a baby is taken away in the night from
a mother who is a child too young to be a

35
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,120
mother.

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,950
It is months before a father decides that
he must lock his daughter in the back room.

37
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,400
He must do this because he loves his daughter,
and she will never find a good husband if

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,540
people know her dark secret.

39
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,729
It is months before a child with long feet
like his father and a curved eyebrow like

40
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,600
his mother is taken away in the night...

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,600
A child who will never see the long feet of
his father or the curved eyebrow of his mother.

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:38,630
It is morning, on that day months before,
and a young woman, hundreds of miles away,

43
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,710
wakes up to find a little blood between her
legs.

44
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,780
Now her husband's family will decide that
she can never have children.

45
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:58,340
And her husband's mother will say, once again,
that she is no good.

46
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:05,880
She will say that a woman who cannot have
children is no use to the family.

47
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Tears run down the young woman's face and
she wants to die, because she does not want

48
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:22,590
to give this news to her husband, who was
hoping, hoping, hoping.

49
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,530
What can he do?

50
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:33,620
He has fought with his mother again and again,
but now he has to agree at last.

51
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,790
He has to say, yes, he will take this barren
woman back to her family.

52
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,210
There is no use for her here.

53
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,750
He is the only son of the house, and a wife
who cannot have children is no use to him

54
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,930
and his family.

55
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,830
The trouble is that he has learnt to like
this woman who is his wife.

56
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,340
Maybe he has even learnt to love her.

57
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,760
He talks to her softly while she cries in
his arms.

58
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:21,740
We will do something, he tells her, we will
do something.

59
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,680
They travel to a country, which is at war,
where the people live with death every day

60
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,620
of their lives.

61
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:37,150
And for these people, a baby who is taken
away from them is a baby who has escaped from

62
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,990
the house of death.

63
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:50,030
This is what the woman tells them - the woman
stranger who smells of expensive perfume.

64
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:57,690
Now she is in the place where she belongs,
in a cool modern office, with carpets on the

65
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,050
floor and soft comfortable chairs.

66
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:09,410
It will cost them money, the woman tells them
- a small sum of money for this only son and

67
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:18,610
his barren wife, but a very large sum of money
for the old man in his wooden house.

68
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,200
But he will not see that money.

69
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,919
It is not for him.

70
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:35,590
Months later, the only son and his barren
wife have a small boy; a baby with long feet

71
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,790
and a curved eyebrow.

72
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,080
They are happy.

73
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,930
There is a grandson in the house, and the
family name will continue.

74
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,490
The boy will eat well every day, he will have
the love of a family around him.

75
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:03,840
He will never be hungry, he will never know
war, he will never have to live in fear and

76
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:13,419
in pain, without friends, without hope, without
love.

77
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:20,169
Years are gone, and a young married woman
with a curved eyebrow cooks rice in a pot

78
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:24,280
over an open flame.

79
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:32,399
She looks at her small daughter, who shakes
her fat little feet at the sky.

80
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,750
And like a dream that never ends, the woman
sees the long feet of a child who will never

81
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,060
know where they came from.

82
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:56,490
The tears run slowly down her cheek, falling,
lost, in the steaming pot of rice.

83
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,080
- THE END -
