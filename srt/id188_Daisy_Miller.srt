CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,920
Veney, Switzerland

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,520
Vevey is a beautiful little town on the shore of 
a very blue lake in Switzerland. Tourism is the  

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:21,360
business of the place, and there are many hotels. 
American tourists particularly like the hotel  

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,840
called the Trois Couronnes. Two years ago, a 
young American named Frederick Winterbourne  

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,040
spent a few days there. He had come from Geneva to 
see his aunt, Mrs Costello, who was staying at the  

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Trois Couronnes. The morning after Winterbourne 
arrived in Vevey, his aunt had a headache,  

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,160
so he was free to sit in the garden of the hotel 
and enjoy its beauties. He sat by the wall,  

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,840
looking out at the Castle of Chillon, 
which stood on a small island in the lake.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Winterbourne was twenty-seven years old 
and had lived in Geneva for a long time.  

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,960
He had been at school and university there. 
When his friends spoke of him, they usually said  

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,760
that he was at Geneva 'studying'. When certain 
other people spoke of him they said that he  

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,240
spent so much time in Geneva because he was 
very attached to a lady who lived there - a  

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,800
European lady - a person older than himself. None 
of his American friends had ever met this lady.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,400
As Winterbourne was drinking his coffee 
in the garden of the Trois Couronnes,  

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
a small boy came up to him and said, 
'Can you give me a lump of sugar?'

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,600
Winterbourne noticed that the boy spoke with an 
American accent. He pointed to the bowl of sugar  

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,080
and said, 'Take one, but I don't 
think sugar is good for little boys.'

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,920
The boy took three lumps of sugar. He put 
two in his pocket and one in his mouth. 'I  

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,680
eat sugar lumps,' he said, 'because I can't get 
any candy here. American candy is the best.'

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
'And are American boys the 
best?' asked Winterbourne.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,880
'I don't know,' said the child. 'I am an 
American boy. Are you an American man?'

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,440
'Yes.'

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,000
'American men are the best!' said the boy. Then, 
looking round, he added, 'Here comes my sister!'

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Winterbourne looked up and saw a 
beautiful young lady coming towards them.  

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,560
'American girls are the best!' he 
said cheerfully to his companion.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,720
'My sister isn't the best,' said the 
boy. 'She's always criticising me.'

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,320
'That's probably your fault, not hers,' said 
Winterbourne. The young lady was dressed very  

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,320
elegantly in white. 'How pretty they are!' 
thought Winterbourne, preparing to get up.

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
The young lady stopped in front of him.  

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,080
She looked out over the blue lake. 
'Randolph!' she said. 'What are you doing?'

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
'I'm talking to this man,' said 
Randolph. 'He's an American.'

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,080
Winterbourne stood up and said, 'Your 
brother and I have been discussing America.'  

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,880
He felt a little embarrassed: in Geneva, a 
gentleman could not speak to a young lady without  

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,720
being formally introduced. The young lady looked 
at him quickly then looked back at the lake.

36
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
'We've been talking about 
American candy,' said the boy.  

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
'I don't want to go to Italy. 
I want to go home to America!'

38
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,760
'Are you going to Italy?' asked Winterbourne.

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
'Yes,' replied the young lady.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,240
'Italy is a beautiful place.'

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,920
'But can you get any candy there?' asked Randolph.

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,720
'I think you've had enough candy,' said 
his sister, 'and Mother thinks so too.'

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,640
'Isn't this a splendid lake?' said Winterbourne. 
He no longer felt embarrassed, because he realised  

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,720
that the young lady did not feel embarrassed. When 
she looked at him, her eyes were honest and fresh.  

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,840
They were very pretty eyes. In fact, she was 
the prettiest girl he had seen for a long time.  

46
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Her face was delicate but perhaps a little 
vulgar; it was bright, sweet, and superficial.  

47
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,960
He thought that she might be a flirt, 
but her expression was too innocent.  

48
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,320
Before long, she was speaking to him freely. She 
told him that she was going to Rome for the winter  

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
with her mother and Randolph. She told 
him that she was from New York State.

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,680
'Her name's Daisy Miller,' said Randolph. 'But 
that isn't her real name. Her real name is  

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,280
Annie P. Miller. And my father's name is 
Ezra B. Miller. He's back in New York State.  

52
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,840
He's got a big business. My father's rich.'

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,680
Miss Miller sat down and talked to Winterbourne 
while Randolph ran round the garden. She talked  

54
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,320
a lot - about her family, about her travels 
in Europe, about the hotels and the trains.  

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,600
Sometimes she looked at Winterbourne, 
and sometimes she looked out at the lake.

56
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,800
'The hotels are very good,' said Miss Daisy 
Miller. 'And I think Europe is perfectly  

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,120
sweet. I'm not disappointed - not at all. I 
knew a lot about Europe before I came here.  

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
I have lots of friends at home 
who have travelled in Europe,  

59
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
and they told me all about it. And back 
home I have lots of dresses from Paris...'

60
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,120
Winterbourne enjoyed this 
conversation. It was many years  

61
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,440
since he had heard a young girl talk so much.

62
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,640
'The only thing I don't like about Europe is 
the society,' said Miss Miller. 'I like society.  

63
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,040
Last winter seventeen dinners were given in my 
honour, three of them by gentlemen.' She looked at  

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,720
him with her slightly monotonous smile and said, 
'I've always had a lot of gentlemen friends.'

65
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and charmed. 
He felt that he had lived too long in Geneva  

66
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,640
and therefore could no longer understand young 
American girls. He had never met a girl like  

67
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:40,240
this before. Was she simply a pretty girl from 
New York - were they all like that? Or was she  

68
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,200
an immoral young woman? She looked extremely 
innocent. Winterbourne decided that she was  

69
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,920
just a pretty American flirt. He was happy to have 
found a formula to describe Miss Daisy Miller.

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,840
'Have you been to that old castle?' asked Miss 
Miller, pointing to the Castle of Chillon.

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,800
'Yes.'

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,400
'I want to go there, but 
Randolph doesn't want to go.'

73
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,320
'You could ask someone to stay 
with Randolph at the hotel.'

74
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
'Will you stay with him?'

75
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,480
'Can't I come to the Castle of Chillon with you?' 
asked Winterbourne. He was afraid that he had  

76
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,960
offended her, but she did not blush. 'And your 
mother, of course,' he said very respectfully.

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
'Oh, Mother won't come,' said Miss Daisy 
Miller. 'She'll stay with Randolph,  

78
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,040
and Eugenio will stay too - he's our 
courier - so we can go to the castle.'

79
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,200
Winterbourne thought, '"We" can only mean 
Miss Miller and I, it's too good to be true!'

80
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,000
At that moment Eugenio came up to 
them. He looked at Winterbourne  

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
with suspicion then said, 
'Lunch is ready, mademoiselle.'

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,320
'Oh, Eugenio!' Daisy Miller replied, 
'I'm going to that old castle anyway.'

83
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
'Really?' said Eugenio. He looked 
at Winterbourne disrespectfully.

84
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Miss Miller blushed a little. 'We are 
going, aren't we?' she asked Winterbourne.

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
'I won't be happy until we go!' he said.

86
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,920
'And you are staying at this hotel?' she 
continued. 'And you really are an American?'

87
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,080
'I'll introduce you to my aunt, Mrs 
Costello. She can tell you all about me.'

88
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,520
'Oh, well,' said Daisy 
Miller, 'we'll go some day.'  

89
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,080
She smiled at Winterbourne and walked 
back to the hotel with Eugenio.
 
 
 

90
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,120
CHAPTER TWO

91
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
Mrs Costello

92
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,960
The next day, Winterbourne went 
to see his aunt in her room.

93
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,000
'I hope you're feeling better,' he said.

94
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,400
'A little,' replied Mrs Costello. She was a rich 
widow and an important figure of New York society.  

95
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:03,200
She had a long pale face and a lot of white hair. 
She had two married sons in New York and a third  

96
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,000
son who was travelling in Europe but had not 
come to see her. Winterbourne had come to Vevey  

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,880
just to see his aunt. She often told him that he 
paid more attention to her than her own sons did.

98
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
'Have you noticed an American 
family here at the hotel?'  

99
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,320
asked Winterbourne. 'A family called Miller?'

100
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,800
'A mother, a daughter, a little boy, 
and a courier? Oh, yes! I've noticed  

101
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,200
them!' said Mrs Costello. 'I confess I'm very 
exclusive, but in New York you have to be.  

102
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,560
There are so many vulgar people in society these 
days. That Miller family is a perfect example.'

103
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
'The young girl is very 
pretty,' said Winterbourne.

104
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,120
'Of course she's pretty, but she's very 
vulgar. She's too friendly with the courier.  

105
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,480
Her mother is just as bad. They treat 
the courier like a family friend.  

106
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,640
He probably eats dinner with them. I'm sure 
they've never seen a man with such good manners,  

107
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,480
such fine clothes, so like a gentleman! He sits 
with them in the garden and smokes cigars.'

108
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
'I see what you mean, of 
course,' said the young man,  

109
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,880
'but I met the young lady in the garden. 
I'd like to introduce her to you.'

110
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,280
'I'm afraid I can't meet her! Why 
do you want to introduce her to me?'

111
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,600
'To guarantee my respectability.'

112
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
'But who'll guarantee hers?'

113
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,640
'Ah, you're cruel!' said the young man. 'She's 
a very nice girl and completely unsophisticated.  

114
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm going to take her to the Castle of Chillon.'

115
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:49,040
'Really? And how long had you known her when this 
plan was formed?' asked Mrs Costello in surprise.

116
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,240
'Half an hour!' said Winterbourne, smiling.

117
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,000
'Oh, what a terrible girl!' cried 
Mrs Costello. 'My dear Frederick,  

118
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,640
you've been away from America too long. You're 
too innocent. You'll make some great mistake.'

119
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
'I'm not so innocent!'

120
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
'You're too guilty, then!'

121
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,520
Winterbourne sat in silence for a while then 
said, 'So I can't introduce her to you?'

122
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,640
'No. I can't accept a girl who 
talks to strangers in hotels.'

123
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,880
'But don't all the young girls in 
America do that sort of thing?'

124
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
'My grand-daughters don't do that 
sort of thing!' said Mrs Costello.

125
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,560
Winterbourne had heard his pretty 
cousins in New York described as  

126
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,760
'terrible flirts'. If Miss Daisy Miller 
did things that his cousins did not do,  

127
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,160
she must be very unconventional indeed. 
Winterbourne was impatient to see her again.

128
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,240
That evening, he met Miss Daisy Miller walking in 
the garden. She seemed very pleased to see him.

129
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,680
'Have you been walking here all alone?' he asked.

130
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,960
'No,' she replied. 'I've been walking 
with Mother, but she's gone to find  

131
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,680
Randolph. She wants him to go to bed. He 
doesn't like to go to bed before eleven.'

132
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
Winterbourne and Daisy walked 
in the garden together.  

133
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,960
'I hear that your aunt is very exclusive,' said 
Daisy. 'I want to meet her. I know I'll like her.'

134
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,440
Winterbourne was embarrassed. 'I'm 
afraid she often has headaches,' he said.

135
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,680
Daisy looked at him for a moment then said, 
'She doesn't want to meet me! Why don't you  

136
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,840
just say so? You needn't be afraid. I'm not 
afraid!' She gave a little nervous laugh.

137
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,400
Winterbourne wanted to comfort her. He 
wanted to tell her that his aunt was a snob  

138
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,480
and that her opinion was 
not important. But just then  

139
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,520
a lady came into the garden and stood at a 
distance from them, looking out at the lake.

140
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,280
'Oh. There's Mother,' said Daisy Miller.

141
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,600
Mrs Miller was a small nervous-looking 
person, very elegantly dressed,  

142
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,320
with enormous diamonds in her ears.

143
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
'I should go,' said Winterbourne.

144
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
'No, no,' replied Daisy.  

145
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,880
'I want to introduce you to Mother. I always 
introduce my gentlemen friends to Mother.'

146
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,120
'She doesn't seem to want to be 
introduced to me,' said Winterbourne,  

147
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,600
since Mrs Miller still had not looked at him.

148
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,000
'She's very shy,' Daisy explained, then she 
took Winterbourne over to meet her mother.  

149
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,480
'Mother, this is Mr Winterbourne,' said Daisy 
very prettily. Yes, Miss Daisy Miller was vulgar,  

150
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,040
as Mrs Costello had said, but Winterbourne thought 
she also had an unusual and delicate grace.

151
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
'Did you convince Randolph 
to go to bed?' asked Daisy.

152
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,200
'No,' replied Mrs Miller. 'He won't go.'

153
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,680
'He won't do what he's told,' said Daisy. 
'He won't go to that castle either,  

154
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
so I'm going with Mr Winterbourne.'

155
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,120
'It's a beautiful castle, Mrs Miller,' said 
Winterbourne. 'Don't you want to see it?'

156
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
'No, thank you,' said Mrs 
Miller. 'Daisy will go, though.'  

157
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
Winterbourne thought how 
very different Mrs Miller was  

158
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,160
from the vigilant mothers of Geneva. They never 
let their daughters go anywhere unprotected.

159
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,440
'Mr Winterbourne,' said Daisy suddenly. 
'Will you take me out in a boat?'

160
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,320
'Now?'

161
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,080
'Yes, now.'

162
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,200
'Well, Annie Miller!' cried her mother.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,880
'I'm sure that Mr Winterbourne wants to take 
me out in a boat!' said Daisy, laughing.

164
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,400
'But what time is it? I'm sure it's 
time to go to bed!' said Mrs Miller.

165
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,800
'It's eleven o'clock, madam,' 
said a voice from the darkness.  

166
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,440
'Oh, Eugenio,' said Daisy. 
'I'm going out in a boat!'

167
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,400
'At eleven o'clock, mademoiselle?'

168
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
'Please tell her she can't go,'  

169
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,600
said Mrs Miller to the courier. 'Does 
mademoiselle want to go alone?' asked Eugenio.

170
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,000
'No,' Mrs Miller replied. 'She wants to go with 
this gentleman!' Eugenio looked at Winterbourne,  

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,960
then he said, 'As mademoiselle pleases.'

172
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,960
'Why don't you say no?' said Daisy to the courier.  

173
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,440
'I don't want to go now.' She 
turned to Winterbourne, smiled,  

174
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,040
and said, 'Good night. I hope you're 
disgusted or disappointed or something.'

175
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,680
'I'm confused,' said Winterbourne. He stood 
and watched the two ladies and their courier  

176
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
as they walked back into the hotel.
 
 
 

177
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
CHAPTER THREE

178
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
The Castle of Chillon

179
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,680
Two days later, Winterbourne and Miss Miller 
went to the Castle of Chillon. They met by  

180
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,600
the main door of the hotel. Daisy ran down 
the stairs, with a bright smile on her face.  

181
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,960
She was simply but elegantly dressed. All the 
couriers, servants, and foreign tourists in the  

182
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:12,080
main hall stared at her. To Winterbourne their 
trip to the castle seemed romantic: he thought  

183
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,800
of it as an adventure, and he hoped that she did 
too, but in this respect he was disappointed.  

184
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:27,040
She seemed happy but not excited. She did not 
blush when she looked at him or when she saw that  

185
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,480
other people were looking at her. Winterbourne 
wanted to go to the castle in a carriage,  

186
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,080
over the wooden bridge that connected 
the island to the shore, but Daisy  

187
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,520
said that she preferred to go in the little 
steamboat. She liked the breeze on the lake.

188
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,240
The steamboat was very crowded, and 
the people stared at Miss Daisy Miller.  

189
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,760
Winterbourne thought, 'Will she embarrass me by 
talking too loudly or laughing too much?' But soon  

190
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,720
he forgot those anxieties. He stood smiling at her 
and listening to her conversation. He had agreed  

191
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,000
with his aunt when she had said that Miss Daisy 
Miller was vulgar, but now he felt uncertain. 'Is  

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,080
she really vulgar?' he asked himself, watching her 
pretty face. Winterbourne did not feel embarrassed  

193
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:26,560
by her at all. In fact, he felt rather proud to 
be with such a beautiful and elegant young lady.

194
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,760
She talked a lot, and most of her conversation 
was about the things she had seen and done.  

195
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,240
She asked him many questions about his life 
and opinions, and she told him about herself  

196
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,640
and her family. At one point, she turned 
to him and said, 'Why are you so serious?'

197
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,760
'Serious?' asked the young man in surprise. 
'I thought I was grinning from ear to ear!'

198
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
'You look as if you were taking me to a funeral.  

199
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
If that's a grin, your ears 
are very close together!'

200
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,240
'I'm having the time of my 
life,' said Winterbourne quietly.

201
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
She looked at him for a moment then laughed:  

202
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,720
'I like to make you say those 
things! You're a strange mixture!'

203
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,080
It was a beautiful sunny day. At the castle, 
they walked around alone except for the guide.  

204
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,080
Winterbourne asked the guide not to hurry, 
to let them pause wherever they pleased.  

205
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
He gave the guide a generous tip as he said this.  

206
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,880
The guide thought he was being paid 
to leave them in peace, and he did so.

207
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,760
Daisy ran up the stairs and looked out of 
the little windows with great enthusiasm,  

208
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,560
but Winterbourne could see that she was 
not really interested in the old castle.  

209
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
She asked him about the history of the 
place, and when he had explained it,  

210
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,080
she said, 'You certainly know a lot. Do you want 
to come travelling with us and teach Randolph?'

211
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,040
'I'm afraid I can't,' Winterbourne replied.

212
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,840
'Why not? You don't work. You're not in 
business. Why can't you do what you want?'

213
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,520
'There are things I must do in Geneva. 
In fact, I must go back there tomorrow.'

214
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
'I don't believe it!' cried Miss Daisy Miller.

215
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
'I'm afraid it's true.'

216
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,680
'Well, Mr Winterbourne, I think you're 
horrible!' For the next ten minutes she  

217
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,960
kept repeating that he was horrible. 
Poor Winterbourne was confused. No  

218
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,840
young lady had ever done him the honour 
of being so agitated by his departure.

219
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
'I suppose you must be going to 
see a lady there!' said Daisy.

220
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,280
'No, I'm not!' protested Winterbourne, but he 
thought, 'How does she know about the lady?'  

221
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,400
He was surprised by her insight and by the honest 
way she confronted him about the lady in Geneva.  

222
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,120
Miss Daisy Miller seemed to him an extraordinary 
mixture of innocence and vulgarity.

223
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
'Does she never allow you out 
for more than three days?'  

224
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,800
asked Daisy sarcastically. 'Doesn't 
she give you a vacation in the summer?  

225
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,120
But never mind. I'll forgive you if you 
promise to come to Rome in the winter.'

226
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,440
'Certainly I'll come,' said 
Winterbourne. 'My aunt has a  

227
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,880
house in Rome, and I've promised 
to visit her there this winter.'

228
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,280
'I don't want you to come for your aunt,' said 
Miss Daisy Miller. 'I want you to come for me.'

229
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,760
After this, Daisy lost all interest in the 
castle and the lake. Winterbourne found  

230
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,600
a carriage to take them back to the hotel. 
On the journey back, she was very quiet.
 
 
 

231
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,560
CHAPTER FOUR

232
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
Meeting in rome

233
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:00,160
The next day, Winterbourne returned to Geneva, 
but in January he went to Rome, as promised.  

234
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,880
On his first evening there, his aunt 
said to him, 'That Miller family is here.  

235
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,760
The girl goes out alone with Italian 
men - well-known Roman fortune-hunters.  

236
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,680
And she takes them to respectable people's houses! 
It's a great scandal. When she comes to a party,  

237
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,160
she brings with her a gentleman with 
elegant manners and a splendid moustache.'

238
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,840
'And where's her mother?' asked Winterbourne.

239
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,160
'I've no idea,' Mrs Costello replied. 'They're 
terrible people.' Winterbourne thought for a  

240
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,240
moment. 'They're just very ignorant and innocent. 
I really don't believe that they're bad people.'

241
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,480
'They're very vulgar,' said his aunt. 'You may 
say that being vulgar is different from being bad,  

242
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,880
but I don't see the difference.' Winterbourne 
had imagined Miss Daisy Miller looking out of her  

243
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,480
window in a Roman hotel rather sadly, waiting for 
him to arrive. This new picture of her surrounded  

244
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:12,160
by Roman fortune-hunters did not please him, so he 
did not go to visit her on his first day in Rome.  

245
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,240
Instead he went to the house of Mrs Walker, an 
American lady he knew from Geneva, where her  

246
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,800
children were at school. She lived in the Via 
Gregoriana. Winterbourne found her in a little  

247
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:32,240
red drawing-room full of afternoon sunshine. As he 
was talking to Mrs Walker, the servant came in and  

248
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:40,160
announced, 'Mrs Miller!'. Then Randolph entered 
the room, followed by Daisy and her mother.

249
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,880
'Well!' said Daisy in surprise. 'I didn't know 
you were in Rome! Why didn't you come to see me?'

250
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
'I only arrived yesterday,' replied Winterbourne.

251
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
Randolph looked around the room and said, 
'We've got a bigger place than this.  

252
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
The walls are all gold.'

253
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
'Oh, Randolph!' said Mrs Miller nervously.

254
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,840
'Are you enjoying Rome?' Winterbourne asked her.

255
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,080
'Well, I'm rather disappointed,' she replied.  

256
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,680
'We'd heard so much about it, but we've 
seen other places I like much better.'

257
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,760
'Really? Which places?'

258
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,680
'For example, Zurich,' said Mrs 
Miller. 'I think Zurich is lovely,  

259
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,520
and we hadn't heard much about it.'

260
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,120
'The best place we've been is the 
City of Richmond,' said Randolph.

261
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,720
'He means the ship that brought us to Europe,'  

262
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Mrs Miller explained. 'Randolph 
enjoyed the City of Richmond.'

263
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,200
'It's the best place I've seen,' said 
Randolph, 'but it was going the wrong way.'

264
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
'I hope Miss Miller is enjoying 
Rome,' said Winterbourne.

265
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,840
'Oh, yes,' replied Mrs Miller. 'Daisy 
loves Rome. The society is splendid.  

266
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,080
She's invited to many people's houses. She 
goes out much more frequently than I do.  

267
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,600
And she knows a lot of gentlemen 
here. Yes, she loves Rome.  

268
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,520
Of course, young ladies are always happier in 
a place if they know a lot of gentlemen there.'

269
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Daisy had been talking to Mrs Walker, but 
now she turned to Winterbourne and said,  

270
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,160
'I've been telling Mrs Walker how 
horrible you were to me in Vevey.'

271
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,480
Winterbourne was rather irritated. She did 
not seem to appreciate the fact that he had  

272
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,840
travelled from Geneva without stopping 
at Bologna or Florence, simply because  

273
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,600
he was impatient to see her. He remembered an 
American friend of his who had told him that  

274
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,760
American women - the pretty ones - were the most 
demanding and least grateful women in the world.

275
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,560
'My dear young lady!' cried Winterbourne.  

276
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,000
'Have I come all the way to Rome 
just to hear you criticise me?'

277
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,480
But Daisy ignored him. She turned 
back to Mrs Walker and said,  

278
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,280
'Thank you for inviting us to your 
party. We gladly accept the invitation.'

279
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,160
'I'm delighted to hear it,' replied Mrs Walker.

280
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,000
'I've got a lovely dress.'

281
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
'I'm very sure of that.'

282
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,680
'But I want to ask you a favour: 
can I please bring a friend?'

283
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,480
'Certainly,' said Mrs Walker, smiling at Mrs 
Miller. 'Any friend of yours is welcome.'

284
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,280
'Oh, they're not my friends,' said Mrs Miller 
with a nervous smile. 'I've never met them!'

285
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,000
'He's a very close friend of 
mine,' said Daisy. 'Mr Giovanelli.'

286
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,320
Mrs Walker was silent for a moment. 
She looked quickly at Winterbourne  

287
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,280
then said, 'Mr Giovanelli is 
welcome to come to the party.'

288
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,960
'He's an Italian,' continued Daisy serenely. 
'He's the most handsome man in the world,  

289
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,640
except for Mr Winterbourne. He knows lots of 
Italians, but he wants to meet some Americans.  

290
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,000
He's very clever and perfectly lovely!'

291
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,960
'Daisy,' said Mrs Miller. 'It's 
time to go back to the hotel.'

292
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,280
'You go,' Daisy replied with a smile. 
'I'm going to the Pincio for a walk.'

293
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,320
'She's going to walk with Mr 
Giovanelli,' said Randolph.

294
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,680
'Alone, my dear?' asked Mrs Walker. 'And 
at this hour? I don't think it's safe.'

295
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,320
'Neither do I,' said Mrs 
Miller. 'You'll get the fever!'

296
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,280
'I'm not going alone,' said Daisy to Mrs Walker. 
'I'm going with the beautiful Mr Giovanelli.'

297
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
'My dear young friend,' said Mrs Walker.  

298
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,680
'Don't go to the Pincio at this 
hour to meet a beautiful Italian.'

299
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,480
'Oh!' said Daisy. 'I don't 
want to do anything improper.  

300
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,160
Perhaps Mr Winterbourne will walk to the 
Pincio with me. That'll solve the problem.'

301
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Winterbourne agreed, and they walked together 
down the stairs and past Mrs Miller's carriage,  

302
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,560
in which Eugenio was waiting.

303
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,840
'Goodbye, Eugenio,' cried Daisy. 
'I'm going for a walk.'
 
 
 

304
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,080
CHAPTER FIVE

305
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
Introducing Mr Giovanelli

306
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,760
As they walked, Daisy told Winterbourne 
all about her experiences in Rome.  

307
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:39,360
'We have very beautiful rooms at the hotel,' 
she said. 'We'll stay here all winter,  

308
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,200
unless we die of the fever, and in 
that case we'll stay even longer!  

309
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,480
I'm enjoying Rome very much. I know lots of 
charming people here...' She talked like this  

310
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,760
for some time, then she turned to him and 
asked, 'Why didn't you come to visit me?'

311
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,840
'I've already told you,' Winterbourne 
replied. 'I've only just got off the train.'

312
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,360
'You must have stayed on the train 
a long time after it stopped!'  

313
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,160
said Daisy, with a little laugh. 'Anyway, 
you've had time to go and visit Mrs Walker.'

314
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,480
'I know Mrs Walker from Geneva-'

315
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,920
'I know. She told me. Well, 
you know me from Vevey.  

316
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,440
That's just as good. So you 
ought to have come to visit me.'

317
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,320
When they reached the Pincio, 
Daisy saw Mr Giovanelli.  

318
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
He was standing by a tree, looking 
at the women in their carriages.  

319
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,320
He was a handsome little man, very elegantly 
dressed, with a flower in his buttonhole.

320
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,720
'Are you going to speak to 
that man?' asked Winterbourne.

321
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,080
'Of course!' said Daisy.

322
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,520
'Then I'm staying with you.'

323
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,640
Daisy stopped and looked at him for a 
moment in silence, but the expression  

324
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,360
on her face was still serene. 'I don't like 
the way you say that,' she said with a smile,  

325
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,960
'I never allow gentlemen to tell me what to do.'

326
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,920
'I think you've made a 
mistake,' Winterbourne replied.  

327
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,600
'You should sometimes listen to 
a gentleman - the right one.'

328
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,960
She looked at him again, more seriously this time, 
with her pretty eyes, then she laughed and said,  

329
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,840
'I do nothing but listen to gentlemen! 
Is Mr Giovanelli the right one?'

330
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,840
Just then, Giovanelli saw 
them and walked up to them.  

331
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,960
He had a brilliant smile and intelligent eyes.

332
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,160
'No, he isn't the right one,' said Winterbourne.

333
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Daisy introduced Giovanelli to Winterbourne, and 
they walked along, one gentleman on each side of  

334
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,520
Daisy. Mr Giovanelli spoke English very well. 
He made pleasant conversation with Winterbourne  

335
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,440
and Daisy. He was disappointed that Daisy 
had not come alone, but he did not show his  

336
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,960
disappointment. 'He's not a gentleman,' thought 
Winterbourne. 'He's a good imitation of one,  

337
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,640
but a nice girl ought to know the difference!' But 
was Miss Daisy Miller a nice girl? That was the  

338
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:20,160
question. She had no delicacy, and yet she did not 
seem impatient for Winterbourne to go: she did not  

339
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,960
seem to want to be alone with her lover. She was 
a strange combination of audacity and innocence.

340
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,920
Fifteen minutes later, Winterbourne noticed Mrs 
Walker sitting in her carriage at the side of the  

341
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,960
road. She waved to him. He left Miss Miller 
with Mr Giovanelli and went to Mrs Walker,  

342
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,320
who looked agitated. 'This is terrible!' said Mrs 
Walker. 'That girl mustn't do this kind of thing.  

343
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,920
She mustn't walk here with you two 
men. Fifty people have noticed her!'

344
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,160
'Is it really that important?' asked 
Winterbourne. 'She's very innocent.'

345
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,080
'She's very crazy!' cried Mrs Walker. 
'And her mother is an absolute  

346
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,960
fool! When you left, I thought that, 
since her mother won't warn her, I should,  

347
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,840
so I came here to find her. Tell 
her I want to speak to her.'

348
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,880
'I don't think it's a good idea,' 
said Winterbourne, 'but you can try.'

349
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,400
When Winterbourne gave Daisy this message,  

350
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,840
the young lady walked serenely to Mrs Walker's 
carriage with Mr Giovanelli at her side.

351
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,520
'Mrs Walker, this is Mr 
Giovanelli,' said Daisy prettily.

352
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,560
Mrs Walker nodded to the Italian 
then turned to Daisy and said,  

353
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,320
'Will you get in the carriage and drive with me?'

354
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,800
'No, thank you,' said Daisy. 'I'm perfectly happy 
as I am.' And she smiled at her two gentlemen.

355
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,240
'You may be perfectly happy, dear child,  

356
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,600
but it isn't the custom here for a young 
lady to walk alone with gentlemen.'

357
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,320
'Well, it ought to be!' said 
Daisy. 'I love walking!'

358
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,800
'You should walk with your 
mother, dear,' said Mrs Walker.

359
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,040
'My mother never goes for a walk. 
And I'm not five years old!'

360
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,000
'You're old enough to be more 
reasonable,' said Mrs Walker.  

361
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,320
'You're old enough, my dear Miss 
Miller, to cause a scandal.'

362
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,560
'What do you mean?' asked 
Daisy, smiling intensely.

363
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,280
'Come into my carriage, and I'll 
explain it to you,' Mrs Walker replied.

364
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,160
Daisy looked at Giovanelli then at Winterbourne. 
'I don't think I want to know what you mean!'  

365
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,480
She blushed, and Winterbourne thought she was 
extremely pretty. She looked at Winterbourne  

366
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,720
and said, 'Do you think that - to save my 
reputation - I should get into the carriage?'

367
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,440
Winterbourne blushed a little and hesitated. It 
seemed so strange to hear her talk that way of her  

368
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,560
'reputation'. He wanted to give the 
reply that was best for Daisy herself.  

369
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,720
He felt that it was in Daisy's best interest 
to hear the truth, and the truth, Winterbourne  

370
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,520
thought, was that she should do what Mrs Walker 
had asked her to do. He looked at her exquisite  

371
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:24,080
prettiness and then said, very gently, 'I 
think you should get into the carriage'.

372
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:33,680
Daisy gave a violent laugh. 'How ridiculous! If 
this is improper, Mrs Walker, then I am improper.  

373
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,840
Goodbye!' Then she turned and 
walked away with Mr Giovanelli.

374
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:46,000
Mrs Walker watched her go with tears in her eyes. 
'Get in the carriage,' she said to Winterbourne.

375
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
'I think I should accompany Miss Miller.'

376
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,520
'If you don't get into this carriage, I'll 
never speak to you again!' cried Mrs Walker.

377
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,320
Winterbourne said goodbye to Daisy and Giovanelli  

378
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,760
and got into the carriage. 'That 
wasn't very clever of you,' he said.

379
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,400
'I'm not trying to be clever;  

380
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm trying to be honest,' replied Mrs 
Walker. 'She's causing a great scandal.  

381
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,320
Italian men come to see her at her hotel late at 
night, when her mother has already gone to bed.'

382
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,240
'She's just unsophisticated,' 
said Winterbourne impatiently.

383
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,600
'She has no natural delicacy,' replied 
Mrs Walker. 'You must stop seeing her,  

384
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,400
stop flirting with her: leave her alone!'

385
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,880
'I can't do that. I like her very much.'

386
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,480
'Then you should want to protect her 
from scandal.' Winterbourne got out of  

387
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,400
the carriage and said goodbye to Mrs Walker. He 
saw Daisy and Giovanelli standing by the wall,  

388
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,160
looking at the beautiful Villa Borghese. 
Giovanelli took Daisy's parasol and  

389
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,920
opened it. He rested the parasol on her shoulder 
so that both their heads were hidden behind it.  

390
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,240
Winterbourne hesitated a moment, then he turned 
and walked away, towards his aunt's house.
 
 
 

391
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,080
CHAPTER SIX

392
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,440
Mrs Walker's party

393
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,320
Mrs Walker's party was a few days later. Mrs 
Miller came alone. The poor lady was very  

394
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,840
nervous. 'I've never been to a party alone before, 
especially in this country!' she told Mrs Walker,  

395
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,840
'I wanted to bring Randolph or Eugenio, 
but Daisy told me to go alone!'

396
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,840
'Is your daughter going to favour us 
with her company?' asked Mrs Walker,  

397
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,480
but Mrs Miller did not notice her sarcasm.

398
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,040
'Well, she's dressed for the party. She 
got dressed before dinner. But her friend  

399
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,200
is there - the Italian gentleman. Daisy's 
playing the piano and Mr Giovanelli's singing.  

400
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,760
He sings splendidly. But I think they'll 
come soon,' said Mrs Miller hopefully.

401
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,200
Mrs Walker turned to Winterbourne and said, 
'This is horrible! Miss Miller is trying to  

402
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,520
punish me for criticising her in the Pincio the 
other day. When she comes, I won't speak to her!'

403
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,320
Daisy came after eleven o'clock. 'I'm sorry 
I'm late,' she said to Mrs Walker with a  

404
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,800
smile. 'Mr Giovanelli and I were practicing 
his songs so that he can sing for your guests.  

405
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,040
He has such a beautiful voice.' Daisy looked 
very lovely as she said this in her sweet, bright  

406
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,760
voice. 'Is there anyone here I know?' she asked, 
looking around with interest at the other guests.

407
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,200
'I think everyone knows who you are!' 
said Mrs Walker coldly. Mr Giovanelli  

408
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,520
sang his songs very well, although no one had 
asked him to do so. Daisy talked as he sang.  

409
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,840
'I'd love to dance,' she said to 
Winterbourne, 'but these rooms are too small.'

410
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,000
'I don't want to dance,' Winterbourne 
replied. 'I can't dance.'

411
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,360
'Of course you can't dance; you're too stiff.'  

412
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,040
said Miss Daisy. 'I hope you enjoyed 
your ride in Mrs Walker's carriage.'

413
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,240
'No, I didn't enjoy it. I 
preferred walking with you.'

414
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,600
'You went with your friend, and I 
went with mine. That was much better.  

415
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,400
But really, Mrs Walker has such strange ideas!'  

416
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,600
continued Daisy. 'How could I get into her 
carriage and leave poor Mr Giovanelli?'

417
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,840
'Mr Giovanelli was wrong to 
ask you to walk with him.  

418
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,240
No young Italian lady walks 
with gentlemen in the streets.'

419
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,920
'In the streets?' cried Daisy. 'The Pincio 
is not "the streets"! And fortunately I'm  

420
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,240
not a young Italian lady! It seems 
to me they have a miserable time!'

421
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,040
'People here think you're 
a flirt,' said Winterbourne  

422
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,280
seriously. 'Of course I am!' 
said Daisy with a smile.  

423
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,800
'All nice girls are flirts! But I suppose 
you'll say that I'm not a nice girl.'

424
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,800
'You're a very nice girl,' said Winterbourne, 
'but I want you to flirt with me and nobody else.'

425
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,960
'Thank you!' replied Daisy. 'But I don't 
want to flirt with you: you're too stiff!'

426
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,560
'Well, at least stop flirting with Giovanelli. 
They don't understand that sort of thing here.'

427
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,960
'I thought they understood 
nothing else!' said Daisy.

428
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,400
'Not in young unmarried women.'

429
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
'It seems to me much more proper 
in young unmarried women than in  

430
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
old married ones,' cried Daisy.

431
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,040
'Well,' said Winterbourne, 'you 
must obey the customs of the place.  

432
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,920
Flirting is a purely American custom; 
it doesn't exist here. So when you  

433
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,840
go out in public with Mr Giovanelli and 
without your mother, people are shocked.'

434
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,120
'Poor Mother!' said Daisy.

435
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,320
'You are flirting, but Mr Giovanelli 
isn't: he's quite serious.'

436
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,920
'At least he doesn't tell me what 
to do!' cried Daisy. 'Anyway,  

437
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm not flirting with Mr Giovanelli. We're 
good friends, very intimate friends.'

438
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,280
'Ah,' replied Winterbourne, 'it's different 
if you're in love with each other.'

439
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,920
To Winterbourne's surprise, 
Daisy blushed and stood up  

440
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,920
angrily. 'At least Mr Giovanelli never 
says such horrible things!' she cried.

441
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,720
Daisy spent the rest of the evening sitting with 
Mr Giovanelli in a quiet corner of the room.  

442
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,240
When she came back to say goodbye to Mrs 
Walker, the lady ignored her. Daisy went pale  

443
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,920
and looked anxiously at her mother. 
Winterbourne felt very sorry for her.

444
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,880
'That was very cruel,' he said to 
Mrs Walker, after Daisy had left.

445
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,760
'I'll never invite her here 
again!' Mrs Walker replied.

446
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,280
In the weeks that followed, Winterbourne 
often went to visit Daisy at her hotel.  

447
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,680
Giovanelli was always there, but Daisy did 
not seem disturbed by Winterbourne's presence.  

448
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
It seemed that she could talk as 
happily with one gentleman or two.

449
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,920
One Sunday afternoon, Winterbourne went to St 
Peter's with his aunt. When he saw Daisy and  

450
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,000
Giovanelli walking together in the great church, 
he said to his aunt, 'There's Miss Miller!'

451
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,840
Mrs Costello looked at Daisy for a moment  

452
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,400
then said, 'Is that what makes 
you so distracted these days?'

453
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,960
'I'm not distracted,' replied Winterbourne.

454
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,520
'You seem very preoccupied: 
you're thinking of something.'

455
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,640
'And what do you think I'm thinking of?'

456
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,440
'Of Miss Miller's intimacy 
with that ridiculous Italian,'  

457
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,320
said Mrs Costello, indicating Giovanelli.

458
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,960
'I don't think it's an "intimacy" 
in the sense you mean.'

459
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,440
'Everyone else does. He's very handsome, and she's 
very vulgar. She thinks he's the most elegant  

460
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,000
gentleman in the world. He's even better than the 
courier! The courier probably introduced them,  

461
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,440
and when they're married this man will give the 
courier a lot of money. Yes, I see how it is.'

462
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,960
'I don't believe she's thinking of 
marrying him,' said Winterbourne,  

463
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,320
'and I don't think he hopes to marry her.'

464
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,120
'She's so vulgar that she probably doesn't think 
at all,' said Mrs Costello. 'But believe me,  

465
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,480
very soon she'll tell you that she's engaged.'

466
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,560
'I don't think so,' Winterbourne replied.  

467
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,480
'I've asked some questions about him. 
He's a perfectly respectable little man,  

468
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,400
but he's not from the best Italian society. 
He has no money and no title - he's not a  

469
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,920
count or a marchese - so he knows that he cannot 
hope to marry her. He probably doesn't realise  

470
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,480
that Daisy and her mother aren't sophisticated 
enough to want to catch a count or a marchese.'

471
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,280
'He thinks he can win her with his 
handsome face,' said Mrs Costello.

472
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,680
'No,' replied Winterbourne. 'He knows 
that he has nothing but his handsome  

473
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,120
face, and he knows that Mr Miller,  

474
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,200
in the mysterious land of dollars, will want his 
daughter to marry someone with more than that.'

475
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,000
Some of Mrs Costello's American friends joined 
them then, and Winterbourne heard a lot of talk  

476
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,920
about the scandalous Miss Daisy Miller. He 
felt sorry for her. He was sorry to hear them  

477
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,640
talking about her like that: to him she seemed 
just pretty and unprotected and natural.

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,520
CHAPTER SEVEN

479
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,760
Innocent or Immoral?

480
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,480
A few days later, Winterbourne went 
to see Mrs Miller at her hotel,  

481
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,800
hoping to persuade her to take 
better care of her daughter.

482
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,440
'I'm sorry, Daisy isn't here,' said Mrs Miller.  

483
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,200
'She's gone somewhere with Mr Giovanelli. She's 
always going somewhere with Mr Giovanelli.'

484
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,760
'I've noticed that they're very 
intimate,' said Winterbourne.

485
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,480
'Oh! It seems as if they couldn't live 
without each other!' said Mrs Miller. 'Well,  

486
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,080
at least he's a real gentleman. I keep 
telling Daisy that she's engaged!'

487
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,000
'And what does Daisy say?'

488
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,240
'Oh, she says she isn't engaged, but she acts 
as if she is! I asked Mr Giovanelli to tell me  

489
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,680
if they get engaged, so that I 
can write and tell Mr Miller.'

490
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,400
Winterbourne had never heard a parent speak 
of a daughter's behaviour in such a distant  

491
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,160
way. He found Mrs Miller's attitude so strange and 
confusing that he gave up the idea of warning her.

492
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:36,240
After that, Winterbourne noticed that Daisy was 
no longer invited to people's houses. Society  

493
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,440
had decided that Miss Daisy Miller had gone too 
far. How did she feel about that? Sometimes he  

494
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,240
thought she did not care: she was too childish and 
superficial to notice what people thought of her.  

495
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,440
At other moments he thought she knew 
perfectly well the impression she produced,  

496
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,240
but she refused to change because 
she knew that she was innocent.  

497
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,280
But then he thought perhaps she refused to 
change because she was irresponsible. It  

498
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,360
was becoming more and more difficult 
for him to believe in her innocence.

499
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,680
He was angry with himself because he 
could not decide what kind of young lady  

500
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,640
Miss Daisy Miller was. He had no idea whether 
her eccentricities were personal or national.  

501
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,160
By not inviting her to their parties, 
the other American residents in Rome  

502
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,240
were sending a clear message to their Italian 
friends, who were all aristocrats. They were  

503
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,360
telling the Italians that, though Miss 
Daisy Miller was an American young lady,  

504
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,440
she was not typical. So perhaps Daisy's 
eccentricities were purely personal.  

505
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,720
But was she innocent or immoral? Did she 
understand the consequences of her actions,  

506
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,920
or was she ignorant of them? Was she simply 
a child, or was she a rebellious young woman?

507
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,840
One day, he met her in the Palace of the Caesars.  

508
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,080
She was walking through the flowers in the 
beautiful deserted gardens with Mr Giovanelli.

509
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,760
'Aren't you lonely?' asked Daisy.

510
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,120
'Lonely?'

511
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,360
'Yes. You're always walking around alone. 
Can't you find anyone to walk with you?'

512
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,640
'I'm not as fortunate as your 
companion,' replied Winterbourne.

513
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,560
From the first, Giovanelli had treated 
Winterbourne with great courtesy and respect.  

514
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,320
He had listened to Winterbourne s conversation 
and laughed whenever Winterbourne said something  

515
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:46,240
amusing. He gave the impression that he 
considered Winterbourne a superior young man.  

516
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:54,960
He did not act like a jealous lover. Obviously, 
Giovanelli was very diplomatic. He did not mind  

517
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,840
showing a little humility 
in front of the American.  

518
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,280
At times, it even seemed to Winterbourne that 
Giovanelli wanted to talk to him privately - to  

519
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,240
explain that of course he, Giovanelli, knew 
that this young lady was too good for him. On  

520
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,160
this occasion, he walked away from his companions 
and went to pick some flowers for his buttonhole.

521
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,760
'I know why you say that,' said Daisy. 'You 
think I spend too much time with Mr Giovanelli.'

522
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,840
'Everyone thinks so.'

523
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,760
'They don't really care what I do,' Daisy replied.

524
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:39,120
'Oh yes, they do, and they'll be very unpleasant 
to you. They're already being unpleasant to you.  

525
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,160
Haven't you noticed?'

526
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,760
'I've noticed you,'  

527
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,840
said Daisy. 'But I noticed that you were very 
stiff and conventional the first time I saw you!'

528
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,120
'I'm not as stiff as some of the 
others,' said Winterbourne, smiling.  

529
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,120
'Haven't you noticed that they don't 
invite you to their houses anymore?'

530
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,320
'Why do you let people be so unkind?' cried Daisy.

531
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,200
'What can I do?' replied Winterbourne.

532
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,880
'You could say something to them.'

533
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,000
'I do say something. I say that 
your mother thinks you're engaged.'

534
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,680
'Well, she does,' said Daisy very simply.

535
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,400
'And does Randolph believe it?' 
asked Winterbourne, laughing.

536
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,920
'I don't know. I don't 
think he believes anything,'  

537
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,400
she replied, 'and since you've 
mentioned it, I am engaged.'

538
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,120
Winterbourne stopped laughing and looked at her 
in surprise. 'You don't believe it!' cried Daisy.

539
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,880
He was silent a moment and 
then said, 'Yes, I believe it.'

540
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,840
'Oh no, you don't!' she replied. 
'Well, then - I'm not!'
 
 
 

541
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,320
CHAPTER EIGHT

542
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,560
A night at the Golosseum

543
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,800
A week later, Winterbourne was walking home alone 
at eleven o'clock at night after dinner with  

544
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,680
friends. He decided to go into the Colosseum. 
Outside, he noticed a carriage was waiting.  

545
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,120
He walked into the silent arena in the moonlight. 
One half of the gigantic circus was in the shadow.  

546
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,880
The place had never seemed more splendid, 
and he remembered Byron's famous lines.  

547
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,920
But then he thought, 'The poets 
love the Colosseum by night,  

548
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:35,760
but the doctors say it's dangerous because of 
the risk of getting malaria. I should go soon.'

549
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,640
As he walked towards the great 
cross in the centre of the arena,  

550
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,800
he saw that two people were on the steps at 
its base. One, a woman, was sitting on a step;  

551
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,320
her companion was standing beside her. 
Then Winterbourne heard the woman's voice:  

552
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,840
'He looks at us as one of those old lions 
must have looked at the Christians!'  

553
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,040
It was the voice of Miss Daisy Miller.

554
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,200
'Let's hope he's not very hungry,' 
Giovanelli replied with a laugh.

555
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,960
Winterbourne stopped. He felt a combination 
of horror and relief. Now at last he knew  

556
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,240
what to think of Miss Daisy Miller: she was not a 
respectable young lady. He felt angry with himself  

557
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,800
for having spent so much time trying to decide 
what to think of her. He turned to walk out of  

558
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:36,880
the Colosseum, but then she spoke again: 'It's Mr 
Winterbourne! He saw me, and he didn't say hello!'  

559
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,800
How cleverly she played the part of the 
innocent! But he could not just ignore  

560
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,800
her. As he walked towards the great cross, 
Daisy stood up and Giovanelli raised his hat.  

561
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:55,440
Winterbourne now began to think how crazy 
she was to be there. A delicate young girl  

562
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,880
should not spend the evening in the Colosseum: she 
might get Roman fever. 'It's now clear,' thought  

563
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,160
Winterbourne, 'that she's an immoral young woman, 
but even so I don't want her to die of malaria.'

564
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,160
'How long have you been here?' he asked angrily.

565
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,960
Daisy, lovely in the moonlight, 
looked at him for a moment  

566
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,080
then said gently, 'We've been here 
all evening. Isn't it pretty?'

567
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:34,080
'You could get malaria! You won't think that's 
pretty!' cried Winterbourne. Then, turning to  

568
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:41,840
Giovanelli, he's said, 'You're a Roman. You know 
about Roman fever. Why did you bring her here?'

569
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,600
'Ah,' said the handsome Roman, 'I'm 
not afraid of getting malaria myself.'

570
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,480
'But what about this young lady?'

571
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,600
'I told the Signorina that it was 
dangerous, but she's never cautious.'

572
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,360
'I've never been ill a day 
in my life!' said Daisy.  

573
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:07,120
'I wanted to see the Colosseum by moonlight, 
and we've had a lovely time. When I get home,  

574
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,320
Eugenio will give me some of his medicine 
against malaria. He has some splendid pills.'

575
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,320
'Well, go home now and take 
one!' cried Winterbourne.

576
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,640
Giovanelli went out to find the carriage. 
Daisy followed with Winterbourne.  

577
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,000
She did not seem at all embarrassed. 
She talked about the beauty of the place  

578
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,680
and how glad she was to seen it by moonlight. 
Then she noticed that Winterbourne was silent.

579
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,960
'Why are you so quiet?' she asked.

580
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,880
Winterbourne did not reply but began to laugh.

581
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,560
'Did you believe that I was 
engaged the other day?' she asked.

582
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,920
'It doesn't matter what I believed the other 
day?' replied Winterbourne, still laughing. 'Now  

583
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,160
I believe it makes very little difference 
whether you're engaged or not!'

584
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,480
Daisy looked at him, but in the 
darkness he could not see her face.  

585
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,240
Then Giovanelli came to say 
that the carriage was ready.

586
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,200
'Don't forget to take Eugenio's 
pills!' said Winterbourne.

587
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,760
Daisy replied in a trembling voice, 'I don't 
care whether I get Roman fever or not!'  

588
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,120
Then she got into the 
carriage, and it drove off.
 
 
 

589
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,160
CHAPTER NINE

590
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,840
Daisy becomes ill

591
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,520
Winterbourne told no one that he had met Miss 
Miller at eleven o'clock in the Colosseum with  

592
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:41,040
a gentleman. Nevertheless, two days later, all 
the American residents in Rome knew about it  

593
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,080
and were talking about 'the little 
American flirt'. Winterbourne found  

594
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,960
that he no longer cared that people were 
saying unkind things about Daisy Miller.

595
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,880
Then he heard that Daisy was very ill. 
He went to the hotel to ask how she was.  

596
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,160
There he met three other visitors who 
said that Daisy was dangerously ill:  

597
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,680
she had a terrible case of 
malaria. He did not see Mrs Miller:  

598
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,120
finally that lady was where she should 
always have been - at her daughter's side.

599
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,240
Winterbourne went to the hotel often to ask 
for news of Daisy. One time he saw Mrs Miller.  

600
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,280
'Daisy spoke of you the other day,' said Daisy's 
mother. 'Half the time she's delirious from the  

601
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,080
fever and she doesn't know what she's 
saying, but that time I think she did.  

602
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,360
She told me to tell you that she was never engaged 
to that handsome Italian. I was very glad to hear  

603
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:46,400
that: Mr Giovanelli hasn't been to see us since 
she got ill. A lady told me that he's afraid  

604
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,440
that I'm angry with him for taking Daisy out at 
night. Well, I am angry with him, but I'm a lady:  

605
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,360
even when I'm angry I can be polite to guests. 
Anyway, Daisy said she's not engaged. I don't  

606
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:08,320
know why she wanted you to know. She told me three 
times. "Be sure to tell Mr Winterbourne" she said.  

607
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:14,240
And then she told me to ask if you remember the 
time you went to that castle in Switzerland.'

608
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,960
A week later, the poor girl died. Daisy's 
grave was in the little Protestant cemetery  

609
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,920
by the wall of imperial Rome, beneath 
the cypress trees and the spring flowers.  

610
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,880
Winterbourne was surprised by the number of people 
present at the funeral. Many people who had been  

611
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:40,400
unkind to her when she was alive came to pay their 
last respects now that she was dead. Giovanelli  

612
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:48,160
stood near Winterbourne. He was very pale. On 
this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole.

613
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,320
When the funeral was over, Giovanelli 
turned to Winterbourne and said,  

614
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,560
'She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw,  

615
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:03,920
and the nicest.' He was silent for a moment, 
then he said, 'And she was the most innocent.'

616
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,760
Winterbourne looked at him then repeated 
his words, 'And the most innocent?'

617
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,000
'The most innocent!'

618
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:22,640
Winterbourne felt very angry. 'Why the devil,' 
he asked, 'did you take her to that fatal place?'

619
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
Mr Giovanelli was silent for a moment,  

620
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,120
then he said, 'I had no fear for 
myself, and she wanted to go.'

621
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,040
'That's no reason!' cried Winterbourne.

622
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,960
Giovanelli was silent again, and then he said,  

623
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,440
'She didn't want to marry me. For a while I 
hoped, but now I'm sure that she didn't want to.'

624
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,920
Winterbourne listened to him. He looked down 
at the new grave surrounded by April flowers.  

625
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,600
When he looked up again, Mr Giovanelli had gone.

626
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,280
Winterbourne left Rome soon afterwards. 
In the months that followed,  

627
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,960
he often thought about Daisy Miller and her 
mysterious manners. The following summer,  

628
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,560
he went to see his aunt Mrs Costello in 
Vevey. One day he spoke to her about Daisy.

629
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,800
'I think I treated her unfairly,' he said.  

630
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,320
'She sent me a message before her death 
which I didn't understand at the time.  

631
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:30,000
But I have thought about it since, and now 
I understand. She wanted me to respect her.'

632
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:37,040
'Is that a modest way of saying she wanted 
you to love her?' asked Mrs Costello.

633
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:45,200
Winterbourne did not reply to this question. After 
a short silence, he continued: 'What you said last  

634
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:52,400
summer was true: I did make a great mistake. 
I've lived too long in foreign countries.'

635
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,880
Nevertheless, he went back to Geneva. His 
friends say that he is 'studying' there.  

636
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:07,840
Other people say that he is interested 
in a very clever foreign lady.
 
 
 
 

637
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,800
-  

638
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,130
THE END -
