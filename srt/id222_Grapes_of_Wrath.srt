CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
Tom Comes Home

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,809
The clouds appeared, but went away again.

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,289
It seemed they did not even try to make rain.

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:18,180
The surface of the earth had formed a dry
hard layer.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,120
The dirt layer broke and the dust formed.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:31,640
Every moving thing - a walking man, a wagon,
a car - lifted the dust into the air.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,960
People stayed in their houses, and they tied
cloth over their noses and wore glasses to

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,940
protect their eyes when they went out.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,040
A great red truck stood in front of a little
roadside diner.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,660
Inside, the truck driver sat on a chair and
rested his elbows on the counter and looked

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,950
over his coffee at the lean and lonely waitress.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:05,420
Outside, a man who was walking along the highway
crossed over and approached the truck.

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,780
He stopped in front of it and read the No
Riders sign on the windshield.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,250
The man outside was close to thirty.

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,710
His eyes were dark brown and his cheeks were
high and wide.

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,800
He wore a new gray suit but it was cheap.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,540
His gray cap was so new that it was still
stiff.

19
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,229
In the diner, the truck driver paid his bill.

20
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:38,892
He was a heavy red-faced man with broad shoulders
and a thick stomach.

21
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:42,990
He stepped outside and walked to the big red
truck.

22
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,440
The man in the cheap gray suit asked, "Could
you give me a lift, sir?"

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,310
"Didn't you see the No Riders sign on the
windshield?"

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,260
"I sure did, but my feet are really tired."

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,110
"New shoes," the truck driver said, looking
down at them.

26
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,450
"You shouldn't walk in new shoes in hot weather."

27
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:11,420
"I don't have any other shoes," the hitchhiker
said.

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,730
"Well, OK then."

29
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,830
"Thanks."

30
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,210
The hitchhiker opened the door and slid into
the seat.

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,430
The driver looked at him carefully, then started
the engine.

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,230
"Are you going far?"

33
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,630
the driver asked.

34
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,630
"No."

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,150
"Looking for a job?"

36
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,959
"No, my pa's got a place.

37
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,250
He's a tenant farmer and we've been there
a long time."

38
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,270
"A tenant farmer and he's still here?"

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,110
"Of course, I ain't heard lately."

40
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,110
The driver then asked, "Have you been at a
job?"

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,830
"I sure have," the hitchhiker said.

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,480
"I thought so.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,599
I see your hands.

44
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,400
They look like they've been swinging a hammer."

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,690
"Would you like to know anything else?

46
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,099
I'll tell you.

47
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,629
My name's Tom Joad.

48
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,690
My pa is old Tom Joad.

49
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,210
And you know where I just came from, don't
you!"

50
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,310
"Now, don't get angry.

51
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,830
That ain't my business," the driver said nervously.

52
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,110
"Well, I'll tell you.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah, I was in prison."

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,830
"It ain't my business," the driver said weakly.

55
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,100
"See that road up ahead?"

56
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Tom asked.

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
"Yeah."

58
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,879
"Well, I get off there."

59
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,610
Soon the truck stopped.

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,390
Tom thanked the driver and the truck went
off.

61
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,192
Tom took off his coat and then his shoes.

62
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:53,480
He wrapped the shoes in the coat and placed
them under his arm.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,760
At last, he walked up the side road through
the fields with a cloud of dust following

64
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,030
behind him.

65
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,430
Then he saw a man sitting under a tree.

66
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,239
The man wore old jeans and a blue shirt.

67
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,910
His shoes, gray with dust, lay on the ground
in front of him.

68
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,289
Tom stopped in the shade and wiped his face
with his cap.

69
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,599
"Hi, it's hotter than hell out here."

70
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,129
The seated man stared at Tom.

71
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,589
"Now, ain't you young Tom Joad?"

72
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:32,589
"Yeah.

73
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,439
Going home now."

74
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,099
"You probably don't remember me," the man
said.

75
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:43,909
"I was the preacher, Reverend Jim Casy.

76
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,219
Just Jim Casy now."

77
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,400
"Sure, I remember you," Tom said.

78
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,999
"You used to give a good service."

79
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,849
"Well, I ain't preaching now.

80
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,140
The spirit ain't in people.

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:04,169
Worse than that, the spirit ain't in me,"
he said sadly.

82
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:11,380
"It's a funny thing, but I was just thinking
about old Tom Joad when you came along.

83
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,999
I was thinking I should visit him.

84
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,379
How is your old pa?"

85
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,259
"I don't know how he is.

86
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,629
I ain't been home in four years."

87
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,139
"Didn't he write to you?"

88
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,330
Tom was embarrassed.

89
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,119
"Well, Pa never did write letters.

90
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:37,060
He could write his name all right, but he
never wrote letters to people."

91
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,120
"So, have you been traveling around?"

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,599
Casy asked.

93
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,339
Tom looked strangely at Casy.

94
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,529
"Didn't you hear about me?

95
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,990
It was in all the papers."

96
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,289
"No.

97
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,449
What happened?"

98
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:03,819
Tom said pleasantly, "Well..." he paused for
a moment and then said, "I've been in McAlester

99
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:05,849
for four years."

100
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:10,369
"I won't ask you any questions if you've done
something bad."

101
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,360
"I'd do it again," Tom said.

102
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
"I killed a guy in a fight.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,069
We were drunk at a dance.

104
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,909
He put a knife in me, so I killed him with
a shovel.

105
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,960
I got seven years for that.

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,449
I got out in four.

107
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,389
I'm out on parole."

108
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,990
"So, you ain't heard anything about your family
in four years."

109
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,289
"Just a couple of Christmas cards from Ma
and Grandma."

110
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,669
"Your pa's house is about a mile from here.

111
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,139
Let's go," Casy said as he got up from under
the tree.

112
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:55,360
The two men hesitated on the edge of the shade,
then walked out into the yellow sunlight.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,719
The path led them through fields of dusty
green cotton.

114
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:07,360
The sun was lower in the sky when Tom pointed
to a fence and said, "There's our line."

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,419
They moved over the top of a hill and saw
the Joad place below them.

116
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,419
Tom stopped.

117
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,680
"It ain't the same," he said.

118
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
"Look at that house.

119
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,479
Something happened.

120
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,559
There ain't anyone there."

121
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:33,240
The Reverend Casy and young Tom stood on the
hill and stared down at the small unpainted

122
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
house.

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,159
Casy said, "Let's look in the house.

124
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,419
It's all pushed out of shape.

125
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,489
If I was still a preacher, I'd say the arm
of God had struck.

126
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,899
But now I don't know what happened."

127
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:56,819
They walked down to the front of the house
and Tom said, "They're gone, or Ma's dead."

128
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,529
He pointed to the low gate across the front
door.

129
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:06,119
"If Ma was anywhere near, the gate would be
shut and hooked."

130
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:13,479
The sun had lowered until it shone through
the windows, and it flashed on the edges of

131
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,039
the broken glass.

132
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,460
Tom Joad turned at last and crossed the porch.

133
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,339
He rolled a cigarette, smoothed it, and lighted
it.

134
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:29,610
He breathed in deeply and blew the smoke out
through his nose.

135
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,510
"Something's wrong," he said.

136
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,740
The preacher stared across the fields.

137
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,819
"Somebody's coming.

138
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:37,819
Look!"

139
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:42,729
"I can't see him because of the dust he's
raising.

140
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,180
Who is that?"

141
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:51,460
The man came closer and, as he walked past
the barn, Tom said, "Oh, I know him.

142
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,720
You know him, Casy - that's Muley Graves."

143
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,740
Then he called out, "Hey, Muley!

144
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,899
How are you?"

145
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,440
The man stopped, and then he walked quickly.

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,769
He was a lean man, fairly short.

147
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,699
His movements were nervous and quick.

148
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:16,610
He wore blue jeans that were thin at the knee
and seat and an old black suit coat that was

149
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,360
spotted with dirt.

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
"Who's that?"

151
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,980
the man called.

152
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,940
Muley came very close before he recognized
the faces.

153
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,910
"Well ..." he said.

154
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,910
"It's Tommy Joad.

155
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,399
When did you get out, Tommy?"

156
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,959
"Two days ago," said Tom.

157
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,279
"It took a little time to hitchhike home.

158
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,279
And look what I find.

159
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,550
Where are my folks, Muley?

160
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,690
And why is the house destroyed?"

161
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,110
"By God, it's lucky that I came by!" said
Muley.

162
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,920
"Yeah, old Tom was worried about you coming
home and finding nobody."

163
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,639
"But where are my folks?"

164
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,170
Tom asked nervously.

165
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,740
"Well, it took three trips with your Uncle
John's wagon.

166
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,050
They're all at your Uncle John's," Muley said.

167
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,050
"Oh!

168
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,680
All at John's.

169
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,250
Well, what are they doing there?"

170
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,089
"They've been picking cotton, all of them,
even the kids and your grandpa.

171
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,680
They're getting money together so they can
go out west.

172
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,790
They're going to buy a car and go out west
where it's easy living.

173
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,790
There's nothing here."

174
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,310
Tom asked, "They ain't gone yet?"

175
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,310
"No," Muley said.

176
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:44,879
"But the last I heard was four days ago."

177
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,050
"OK," said Tom.

178
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,480
"You know the preacher here, Reverend Casy."

179
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,379
"Sure, sure," Muley said.

180
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,972
"Glad to see you again," he said to Casy.

181
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,510
The two men shook hands.

182
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,120
"Where have you been these days?" he asked.

183
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,089
"I've been away asking questions," said Casy.

184
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:09,019
"But, what happened here?

185
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,490
Why did they force folks off the land?"

186
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:20,110
"The dust came up and spoiled everything,
and the folks who owned the land said, We

187
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,680
can't afford to keep tenants.'

188
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,089
So they came with tractors and pushed all
the tenants off the land.

189
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,160
All except me."

190
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:37,370
A large red drop of sun fell over the horizon
and was gone.

191
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,030
Tom said, "Well, we ain't going to walk eight
miles to Uncle John's place tonight.

192
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,189
My feet are sore.

193
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:47,889
Can we go to your place, Muley?

194
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,629
It's only about a half mile away."

195
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:52,800
Muley seemed embarrassed.

196
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,790
"My wife and kids and her brother all left
and went to California.

197
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,110
There wasn't anything to eat here."

198
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,399
"And you didn't go?"

199
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,399
Casy asked.

200
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,529
"Why didn't you stay with your family?"

201
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,029
Muley said, "I couldn't go.

202
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,300
Something wouldn't let me."

203
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,170
"Well, I'm hungry," said Tom.

204
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,814
"Do you have anything to eat, Muley?

205
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:23,740
How have you been getting your dinner?"

206
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,129
Muley said, looking ashamed, "At first I ate
mice.

207
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,129
I had to.

208
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:36,690
But now I've made traps and I catch rabbits
and wild chickens."

209
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:43,050
He reached into his sack and three dead rabbits
came falling out.

210
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:50,250
"Well, it's more than four years since I ate
fresh-killed meat," said Tom.

211
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,230
He rubbed his hands together.

212
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,930
"Who's got a knife?"

213
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,800
Muley gave Tom his pocket knife and Tom prepared
the rabbits.

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,439
They made a fire from some broken wood from
the house.

215
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:11,860
Then Tom put the pieces of meat on a wire
that they found in the barn and turned them

216
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,629
over the fire.

217
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:22,370
After the three men finished eating, the preacher
stood up and said slowly, "Yeah, I'm going

218
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,600
with you, Tom.

219
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,420
And when your folks are out on the road, I'll
go with them."

220
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,810
"You're welcome," said Tom.

221
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,940
"Do you think you'll come along, Muley?"

222
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
"What?

223
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,009
No, I'm not going anywhere," Muley said.

224
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,600
He was staring out ahead.

225
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,910
"Do you see that beam of light moving over
there?

226
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,830
That's probably the man in charge of this
piece of land.

227
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,670
Somebody saw our fire."

228
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,670
Tom looked.

229
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,110
A beam of light was coming from over the hill.

230
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,800
"But we ain't doing anything.

231
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,680
We're just sitting here."

232
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,360
Muley laughed.

233
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,029
"Yeah, we're doing something just being here.

234
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,120
We're trespassing.

235
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
We can't stay.

236
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,450
They've been trying to catch me for two months."

237
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,709
"What's wrong with you, Muley?"

238
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:20,759
Tom asked.

239
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,940
"You never were the type of person to run
and hide."

240
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,420
"Yeah.

241
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,660
But when someone hunts you, that's different.

242
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,350
Something happens to you.

243
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,779
You ain't strong then.

244
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,990
You'll see.

245
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,069
You just sit here and the car will come.

246
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,069
Maybe it'll be Willy.

247
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:46,040
He's a sheriff now, and if you upset him he'll
beat you and send you back to McAlester."

248
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,170
"Well, I don't want that," Tom said.

249
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,189
"But I hate getting pushed around!"

250
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:57,600
"He has a gun," said Muley.

251
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:05,420
The strong lights beamed into the sky now,
and they could hear an approaching vehicle.

252
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,519
"Come on, Tom.

253
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,540
Come on, Casy" Muley waved the two other men
out into the cotton field.

254
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,670
The car came up to the house.

255
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,100
"Get down," Muley said.

256
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,379
Tom and Casy put their heads down.

257
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,779
"They're putting out our fire," Muley whispered.

258
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,300
"Kicking dust over it."

259
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,670
The headlights swung over the field where
the men were hiding.

260
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,480
They dropped their heads lower.

261
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,490
Soon the lights were gone and the car could
be heard driving away.

262
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,530
The three men quietly got up and crossed the
field to a wooded area where Tom looked for

263
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,920
a cave that he dug years ago.

264
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Muley said, "Oh, yeah.

265
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,410
I know the cave you're looking for.

266
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,600
I covered it with a dying bush so nobody could
find it."

267
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,170
Muley then walked a few steps and uncovered
the cave.

268
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,790
"I like it in here.

269
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,189
I feel like nobody can get me."

270
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:16,790
"We need to get some sleep," Tom said.

271
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,360
"We can start for Uncle John's in the morning."

272
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
CHAPTER TWO

273
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,439
The Joad Family

274
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:32,410
All over the southwestern states, the owners
of the land came onto the land, or more often,

275
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,410
someone came for them.

276
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:41,059
All of the owners told their tenants the same
thing: "You know the land's getting poorer.

277
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,939
The bank has to have profits all the time.

278
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:47,889
It can't wait for next year's crops.

279
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:54,269
One man on a tractor can take the place of
twelve or fourteen families.

280
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,160
You'll have to go."

281
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,260
Then the tractors came over the roads and
into the fields.

282
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,790
They drove through fences and houses to make
space for even larger fields.

283
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:15,909
Tom Joad and Jim Casy walked quickly along
a road that was only wheel marks through a

284
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,939
cotton field.

285
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,890
"We'll be at Uncle John's place soon," Tom
said.

286
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,220
Then they walked along in silence.

287
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:32,779
As the eastern sky grew bright, night birds
flew over toward the barns and hollow trees,

288
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,929
where they hid from the sun.

289
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:41,649
The preacher said, "I don't remember John
having a family.

290
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:45,390
He was always a lonely man, wasn't he?"

291
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,140
"The loneliest man in the world," Tom said.

292
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,610
"But he had a young wife some years ago.

293
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,740
They were married four months and she was
expecting a baby.

294
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,909
Then one night she got a pain in her stomach
and she asked John to get a doctor.

295
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:08,929
But he thought it was just a stomachache and
gave her some pills.

296
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:12,340
And, well, she died the next day."

297
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,429
"What was it?"

298
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:15,830
Casy asked.

299
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,880
"Something she ate?"

300
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,230
"No.

301
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,000
Her appendix burst.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,050
But John felt terrible about it.

303
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,200
He thinks he was wrong not to call the doctor."

304
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,321
"Poor fellow," said the preacher.

305
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,321
"Poor lonely fellow."

306
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:38,000
The preacher walked along with his head down.

307
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,620
The earth was brown in the growing light.

308
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,760
"Look," said Tom.

309
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,720
"There's Uncle John's place."

310
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,770
The house was a small square box, unpainted
and plain.

311
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,490
Smoke was rising from the metal chimney.

312
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,899
In the yard were chairs and tables and other
pieces of furniture.

313
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:05,610
"Christ, they're ready to go!"

314
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,610
Tom said.

315
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,549
A high-sided truck stood in the yard, a strange
truck.

316
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:18,960
The front was a car, but the top had been
cut off in the middle and a bed fitted on.

317
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,900
Tom moved forward and leaned against the truck.

318
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,010
His father looked at him, but did not see
him.

319
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,060
He was busy nailing some wood together to
make the truck sides.

320
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:38,190
Tom noticed that he had become older and grayer.

321
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,559
He said softly, "Pa."

322
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,390
"What do you want?"

323
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,570
his father spoke around the nails he had pressed
between his lips.

324
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:55,420
He was a short lean man and wore a dirty black
hat and a blue work shirt.

325
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:02,110
His jeans were held up by an old leather belt
that was ragged from years of wear.

326
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:09,560
He held his hammer in the air and was ready
to hit a nail into the wood when he realized

327
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,750
who it was.

328
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,269
His mouth opened, and the nails fell from
his mouth.

329
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:19,270
A look of fear came into his eyes.

330
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,799
"Tommy," he said softly.

331
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,750
"Did you escape?

332
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,990
Do you have to hide?"

333
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,150
He listened closely.

334
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,580
"No," said Tom.

335
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,190
"I'm paroled.

336
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,810
I'm free.

337
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,049
I have my papers."

338
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,080
Pa dropped the hammer.

339
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,669
He felt embarrassed and strange.

340
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:49,520
"Tommy," he said, "we're going to California,
and we were going to write and tell you.

341
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,250
But now you're back and you can go with us!"

342
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,419
His eyes were bright with excitement.

343
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,890
But then they grew sad.

344
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,850
"Can you go with us, Tom?

345
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,260
Will you break your parole if you leave the
state?"

346
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,510
"Only if they know I left," Tom said.

347
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,980
"Then I'd get sent back to McAlester.

348
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,059
But if they don't know, there's no problem.

349
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,919
We can't stay here."

350
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,500
"Ma will be so happy.

351
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,370
She was worried that she'd never see you again."

352
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,450
He then smiled at his son.

353
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,370
"Let's surprise her."

354
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,039
At last, he touched Tom, but only on the shoulder.

355
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,169
He looked at Jim Casy.

356
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,269
Tom said, "You remember the preacher, Pa.

357
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,750
He came along with me."

358
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,700
"Has he been in prison, too?"

359
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,410
"No, I met him on the road.

360
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,120
He's been away."

361
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,390
Pa shook Casy's hand.

362
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,669
"You're welcome here, sir."

363
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:57,649
Casy said, "I'm glad to be here.

364
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,840
It's a thing to see when a boy comes home."

365
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,420
"Come on," Pa said, walking quickly to the
house.

366
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,809
"I can't wait to see the look on her face
when she sees you."

367
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:19,500
Pa stepped into the doorway and stood there
to block it with his body.

368
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,570
He said, "Ma, there are a couple of fellows
here and they need some food."

369
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,360
"Let them in.

370
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
We have plenty.

371
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,490
But tell them they have to wash their hands."

372
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,899
Pa walked away from the doorway, and Tom looked
in at his mother.

373
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:46,850
She turned toward the door, but the sun was
behind Tom and she only saw a dark figure

374
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,050
with sunlight around it.

375
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,679
"Come in," she said warmly.

376
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,320
Tom continued to look.

377
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,710
Ma was heavy but not fat.

378
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,560
She was thick from having children and work.

379
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,820
Her old dress, with colors that had been washed
out, came down to her ankles.

380
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,440
Pa stood near Tom and shook with excitement.

381
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,990
"Come right in, sir," he said with a broad
smile.

382
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,549
Ma looked up again pleasantly from the frying
pan.

383
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:30,020
Then her hand dropped slowly to her side and
the fork fell to the wooden floor.

384
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,620
Her eyes opened wide.

385
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,590
She breathed heavily through her opened mouth.

386
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,130
Then she closed her eyes.

387
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,389
"Thank God," she said.

388
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:43,899
"Oh, thank God!"

389
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:48,399
But then, suddenly, her face looked worried.

390
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:52,010
"Tommy, you ain't wanted by the police?

391
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,700
You didn't escape?"

392
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,500
"No, Ma.

393
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Parole.

394
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,309
I have the papers right here," he said, touching
his pocket.

395
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,919
Ma moved toward him soundlessly.

396
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:13,779
Her small hand felt his arm and then her fingers
went up to his cheek as a blind person's fingers

397
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,070
might.

398
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,110
"Well," she cried.

399
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,030
"We almost left without you.

400
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,460
We were wondering how in the world you were
going to find us."

401
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,649
"Well, I'm back now, Ma."

402
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:32,720
She smiled gently and returned to preparing
the meal.

403
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,460
Tom asked, "Where's Grandpa?

404
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,190
I ain't seen the old devil."

405
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,000
Ma placed the plates on the table.

406
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,580
"Oh, he and Grandma sleep in the barn because
they get up so much during the night."

407
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,210
Then she looked at Pa.

408
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:57,410
"Pa, run outside and tell Grandma and Grandpa
that Tommy's home."

409
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,260
"Of course," said Pa as he went out the door.

410
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,120
"Ma, when I saw what they did to our house
..."

411
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,960
She moved up closely to Tom and said, "Now,
don't you go fighting them alone.

412
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,600
They'll hunt you down like a wild animal."

413
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,409
Across the yard came four people.

414
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:25,179
Grandpa was ahead.

415
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:29,470
He was a lean, ragged, quick old man.

416
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:36,789
Behind him was Grandma, who wore an old housedress
that she pulled above her knees as she walked.

417
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:41,690
The two old people raced each other to get
across the yard.

418
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:47,340
They fought over everything and loved and
needed the fighting.

419
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:57,090
Behind them were Pa and Noah - Noah, the firstborn
child, tall and strange, always with a puzzled

420
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,510
look on his face.

421
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,120
He moved slowly and rarely spoke.

422
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,610
Grandpa demanded, "Where is he?"

423
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,180
Then he saw Tom standing in the door.

424
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,940
Grandma suddenly cried, "Praise God!"

425
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:21,330
Grandpa walked up and hit Tom on the chest,
and his eyes smiled with love and pride.

426
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,159
"How are you, Tommy?"

427
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,850
"OK," said Tom.

428
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,230
Noah stood on the step and looked at Tom.

429
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,880
His face had little expression.

430
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Tom said, "How are you, Noah?"

431
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,740
"Fine," said Noah.

432
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,950
"How are you?"

433
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,440
That was all, but it was a comfortable thing.

434
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,240
Suddenly Tom said, "Hey!

435
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,320
Where's the preacher?

436
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,090
He was right here.

437
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,930
Where did he go?"

438
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,120
Pa said, "I saw him, but he's gone."

439
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:03,590
Tom stepped out onto the porch and called
out, "Jim, Jim Casy!"

440
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,929
The preacher appeared from behind the barn
and walked over to the house.

441
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,250
"Come on in and eat," said Tom.

442
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:20,010
They all ate quickly, and there was no talk
until the food was gone and the coffee drunk.

443
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,649
Then Tom and Pa stepped outside and looked
at the truck.

444
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:31,100
Pa said, "Your brother, Al, looked it over
before we bought it.

445
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,269
He says it's all right."

446
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,170
"What does that little kid know?"

447
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,610
"He worked for a company and drove a truck
last year.

448
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,230
He knows a little.

449
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,470
And he's sixteen now," Pa explained.

450
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,200
Tom asked, "Where is he?"

451
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,789
"Well," said Pa, "he's out chasing girls again.

452
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:57,850
That's all he thinks about, girls and engines."

453
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,950
"Where's Uncle John?

454
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,750
And where's Rosasharn and Ruthie and Winfield?"

455
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
Tom asked.

456
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,360
"Nobody said anything about them yet."

457
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,210
"Nobody asked," said Pa.

458
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:20,480
"Ruthie and Winfield went into town with John
early this morning to sell a load of stuff.

459
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,009
Rosasharn is staying with Connie and his folks.

460
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,539
Oh, you don't even know.

461
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,982
Rosasharn's married to Connie Rivers, and
she's going to have a baby in four or five

462
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:31,982
months."

463
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:35,149
"Jesus!" said Tom.

464
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:41,730
"Rosasharn was just a little kid when I last
saw her and now she's going to have a baby!"

465
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,399
He smiled at the thought.

466
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,990
"And when are we going to start out west,
Pa?"

467
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,990
"Well, we need to sell some more stuff first.

468
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,100
We ain't got a lot of money.

469
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,679
This man I know said that it's two thousand
miles to California.

470
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,130
Do you have any money?"

471
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,350
"Just a couple of dollars.

472
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,140
How did you get money?"

473
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:13,030
"Well," said Pa, "we sold stuff and then we
picked cotton, even Grandpa."

474
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,140
He looked at his son.

475
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,770
"Did you spend your money on those new clothes?"

476
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,789
"No, Pa.

477
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:23,090
They gave them to me.

478
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,440
I drove a truck at McAlester.

479
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,280
I could drive if you need me to."

480
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,650
"Good," said Pa.

481
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,330
"Hey, there's that little brother of yours
coming up the road."

482
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,440
Tom looked up the road.

483
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,090
He saw Al in stiff jeans and high boots walking
proudly toward them.

484
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,909
When Al got near, he recognized Tom's face
and his face lit up.

485
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:52,820
Tom said, "Wow, Al!

486
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,460
You've grown like a bean!"

487
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,570
Tom put out his hand and Al shook it hard
and fast.

488
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:08,510
Tom stayed in the house that morning and talked
to Ma, while Pa and Al drove into town to

489
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:13,299
sell more tools and furniture and to pick
up the others.

490
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:18,820
Casy went out for one last walk in the fields.

491
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:25,610
Ma said, "Tom, I hope things are good in California."

492
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,990
Tom turned to her.

493
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,610
"What makes you think they ain't?" he asked.

494
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,970
"Well, nothing.

495
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,419
I guess it seems too nice.

496
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:42,100
I've seen handbills being passed out, saying
that there are jobs and high wages.

497
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:49,000
And I've seen in the newspaper that they want
people to pick grapes, oranges, and peaches.

498
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,139
Won't that be great, Tom - picking peaches?"

499
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:59,350
Tom watched her working in the kitchen, and
his eyes smiled at her.

500
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,950
"That does sound good, Ma.

501
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,610
But I met a fellow who said that too many
folks are looking for work right now.

502
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:14,070
And he says the folks that pick the fruit
five in dirty camps and hardly get enough

503
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,429
to eat."

504
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,129
"Oh, no.

505
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:19,549
That ain't so," Ma said.

506
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:24,919
"Your father got a handbill saying that they
need folks to work.

507
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,040
They wouldn't bother making all those handbills
if it weren't true."

508
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,840
"I sure hope you're right, Ma."

509
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,880
In the late afternoon, the truck came back
in a cloud of dust.

510
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,889
The children - Ruthie, the twelve-year-old,
and Winfield, the ten-year-old - stood in

511
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:48,889
the back.

512
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:55,630
Beside them, holding onto the bars of the
truck was blond-haired Rosasharn, who was

513
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,109
thinking about the baby and being careful.

514
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:06,539
In recent weeks, she had become shy and thoughtful
as she worried about becoming a mother.

515
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:15,629
Her nineteen-year-old husband, Connie, a sharp-faced
and lean young man, was proud and afraid of

516
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:16,919
the change in her.

517
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:24,049
When the truck stopped, Ruthie and Winfield
climbed over the bar screaming, "Where is

518
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,049
he?

519
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,049
Where's Tom?"

520
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:33,299
Then they saw him standing beside the door
and stopped suddenly and walked slowly and

521
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,070
shyly toward him.

522
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,460
"Hello.

523
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,020
How are you kids doing?" he asked.

524
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
"Hello!

525
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,139
All right," they replied softly.

526
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:50,970
Then Tom said, "Hey, it's Rosasharn."

527
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:58,210
She smiled sweetly at her brother and said
proudly, "This is Connie Rivers, my husband."

528
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,409
The two young men shook hands.

529
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:06,510
The rest of the day was spent loading the
truck.

530
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:11,110
In the evening they killed and cooked the
last pig.

531
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,330
Then they salted the pieces of meat for the
journey.

532
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:22,980
With the children in bed, the adults gathered
together on the porch to make their plans.

533
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,020
Pa drew numbers in the dust and whispered
to himself.

534
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:34,799
He finally looked up and said, "One hundred
and fifty-four dollars.

535
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,500
That's what we have."

536
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,030
Pa shook his head.

537
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,700
"They say it's two thousand miles to California.

538
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,720
We should go soon."

539
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,960
Tom said, "Well, if we work all night, we
could be ready to leave in the morning."

540
00:33:51,960 --> 00:34:00,440
Tom helped Ma pack the kitchen and the meat,
while Pa and Noah put clothes and tools into

541
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,769
boxes and Casy helped Al prepare the truck.

542
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:12,610
The early morning sunlight was suddenly in
the sky.

543
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,980
Rosasharn and the children were woken first.

544
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,860
With tired faces, they climbed into the truck.

545
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,250
Then, when everything was ready, they woke
up Grandma and Grandpa.

546
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,540
Grandpa's eyes were dull.

547
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,910
He said in a loud voice, "Well, I ain't going!"

548
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,250
"Not going?" said Pa.

549
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,430
"What do you mean?

550
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,150
There's no place to stay."

551
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,550
"I'm staying," the old man said.

552
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,260
"This is my country.

553
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,290
I belong here.

554
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,900
I don't want any stupid oranges or grapes.

555
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,700
This is where I've always lived and this is
where I'm going to stay!"

556
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,000
"Oh, Grandpa," Ma said.

557
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,130
"We have to go.

558
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,830
Sit down and have coffee with us."

559
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,510
Pa and Tom gave Ma a strange look.

560
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:17,380
Grandpa sat down, still protesting, and Ma
prepared the coffee.

561
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,080
To Grandpa's cup she added some strong cough
medicine.

562
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,100
The family watched as he drank his coffee
and ate his pork.

563
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:34,080
They saw him yawn and then rest his head on
his arms and go to sleep.

564
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:41,250
Then Tom and Al lifted him up onto the truck
and laid him on top of the load.

565
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,280
The rest of the family and Casy got into the
truck or on the back.

566
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:55,710
Al started the engine, and as the truck slowly
went up the little hill, he said, "What a

567
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,710
load!

568
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,150
We won't be able to go very fast."

569
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:06,430
The people on top of the load looked back
and saw the house and the barn and a little

570
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,080
smoke still rising from the chimney.

571
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:15,670
The truck moved slowly through the dust toward
the highway and the west.

572
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,670
CHAPTER THREE

573
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,420
Highway 66

574
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:27,950
Highway 66 was the main route for a people
in flight from dust and empty land.

575
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:35,330
All day the cars and trucks filled with families
and everything they owned streamed along the

576
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,330
road.

577
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:43,390
Al was at the wheel, a serious look on his
face, his whole body listening to the truck

578
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,790
for weaknesses.

579
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,020
Grandma sat next to him half asleep.

580
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,140
Ma sat next to Grandma with one elbow out
the window.

581
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,600
Suddenly Grandma said, "I have to get out."

582
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,160
"OK," Al said.

583
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,330
The truck came to a stop at the side of the
road.

584
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,500
Ma and Grandma got out first.

585
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,690
Then the others in the back came to life and
jumped out.

586
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,240
Grandpa stayed in the truck.

587
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,150
"Ain't you going to come out, Grandpa?"

588
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,150
Tom asked.

589
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,020
"No, I ain't going, I'm telling you," Grandpa
said angrily.

590
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,880
"I'm going to stay here like old Muley Graves."

591
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,070
The old man then folded his arms.

592
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,370
"Tom," Ma called out.

593
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,200
"Get that food out.

594
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,460
We need to eat something."

595
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,330
Tom found a pan of pork bones and passed them
around.

596
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,180
Then Winfield said, "I want a drink."

597
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,300
Then Ruthie said, "Yeah, me too."

598
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,210
Al felt his fear growing.

599
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,700
"We'll get water at the first gas station
we come to.

600
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,130
We need gas as well."

601
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,830
The family agreed and quickly got back in.

602
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,550
Al started the motor and they moved on.

603
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:14,520
It was another twenty miles before they saw
a gas station.

604
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,480
Everyone was thirsty and tired.

605
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Al pulled the truck into the station and a
heavy man got up from a chair behind the gas

606
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
pumps.

607
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,860
"Are you folks going to buy anything?

608
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,930
Gas or stuff?" he asked.

609
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,500
"We need some gas, sir," Al said.

610
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,000
"Do you have any money?"

611
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,520
"Of course we do.

612
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
We're not begging."

613
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,010
"Well, that's all right then.

614
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,330
Help yourself to water."

615
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:50,550
Then he explained, "This road is full of people.

616
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:57,100
They come in, use water, dirty the restrooms,
and then they steal stuff.

617
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,800
They don't have any money to buy anything.

618
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,450
Some come here begging for a gallon of gas."

619
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,620
Tom moved angrily toward the man.

620
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,050
"We're paying our own way," he said in an
angry voice.

621
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,600
"We ain't asking for anything."

622
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,250
The man stepped back.

623
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:25,510
"Just help yourself to water, and the restrooms
are out back."

624
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:32,780
Winfield ran to the water and drank hurriedly
and then poured some over his head and face.

625
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,650
The man watched him with a smile.

626
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,540
He then looked at Tom and Al.

627
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,600
"Over fifty cars a day have been stopping
here.

628
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,020
All these folks are moving west.

629
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,940
Where are they going?

630
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,620
What are they going to do?"

631
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,280
"They're doing the same thing as we are.

632
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,700
Looking for work.

633
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,400
Trying to feed our families.

634
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,700
That's all," Tom said.

635
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,510
"Well, I'm just trying to run a business here.

636
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:08,770
These folks come by and beg for gas, and then
they give me stuff for the gas.

637
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:14,060
I can show you beds and baby toys and pots
and pans."

638
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,510
He picked up the gas fine and brought it to
the truck.

639
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,510
"I just don't know what this country is coming
to.

640
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,840
What's happening to people?"

641
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,860
Casy had been listening to the man.

642
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,580
"I've been walking around this country," Casy
said.

643
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,100
"And I've heard a lot of folks asking the
same questions.

644
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,430
Well, people are moving.

645
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:46,390
They're moving because they have to."

646
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,650
Over by the water, Connie and Rosasharn stood
together, talking secretly.

647
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,450
Connie washed a tin cup and filled it with
water.

648
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:02,420
He said, "If there's a lot of work in California,
we can get our own car.

649
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,010
Maybe we can get a house."

650
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,810
"I'd like to have a car," Rosasharn said.

651
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,620
"But the house would come first."

652
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:16,050
"Of course, a house would come first," he
said, looking at his new wife.

653
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,720
"Are you all right?"

654
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,080
"Tired.

655
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,120
I'm just tired from riding in the sun."

656
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,680
"We have to do that or we won't get to California."

657
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,030
"I know," she said.

658
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,760
Then Tom called out, "Come on, everyone.

659
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
We have to go.

660
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,080
We have lots of driving to do."

661
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,550
"Now, where are those kids?"

662
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,940
Pa asked.

663
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
"Winfield!

664
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,870
Ruthie!" he called out.

665
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,080
Then he whistled.

666
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,700
Tom asked Al, "Do you want me to drive?"

667
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,550
Al said, "OK.

668
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,590
But watch the oil and drive it slowly.

669
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,910
This truck is overloaded."

670
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:09,270
The truck drove along slowly and the sun lowered
in the sky in front of them.

671
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,600
The sign said Oklahoma City.

672
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,430
Tom drove straight on.

673
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,210
The outskirts were wide spread.

674
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:28,000
Tom drove carefully in the traffic, and then
they were on 66 - the great western road - again

675
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,340
and the sun was sinking on the line of the
road.

676
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:37,480
Tom said, "We stay on this road all the way."

677
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,460
Ma had been silent for a long time.

678
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,460
"Maybe we'd better find a place to stop before
sunset," she said.

679
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,700
"I have to get some pork boiling and some
bread made."

680
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,410
"Sure," Tom agreed.

681
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,600
"We ain't going to make this trip in one jump."

682
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,600
"Yeah, got to get some supper cooking."

683
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,710
And then she said, "Tom, I'm scared about
you crossing the state line.

684
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,650
Maybe they'll catch you."

685
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:15,310
Tom held his hand over his eyes to protect
himself from the brightness of the sun.

686
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,960
"Don't you worry," he said.

687
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,270
"There're lots of fellows out on parole and
there are more going into jail all the time.

688
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:31,610
If I get caught for anything else out west,
well, then they have my picture and my fingerprints

689
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,610
in Washington.

690
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,870
They'll send me back.

691
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:38,540
But if I don't do any crimes, they won't notice
me."

692
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,300
"I'm still scared about it.

693
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,560
Sometimes you do a crime and you don't even
know it.

694
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,800
Maybe they have crimes in California we don't
even know about."

695
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,210
"Stop worrying, Ma."

696
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,230
"I can't help it," she said.

697
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,230
"The minute you cross the line you've done
a crime."

698
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:04,750
"Well, it's better than staying in Oklahoma
and dying of hunger," he said.

699
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,770
"We need to look for a place to stop."

700
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,200
Then he pointed ahead.

701
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,150
"There're some folks camping.

702
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,190
It looks like a good place to me."

703
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,650
He slowed the truck and stopped beside the
road.

704
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:25,080
A middle-aged man stood looking down at the
motor of his old car.

705
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,260
His face was thin and his chin stood out sharply.

706
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,990
Tom leaned out of the window.

707
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:36,770
"Any law against folks stopping here for the
night?"

708
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,890
The man looked at Tom.

709
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,650
"I don't know," he said.

710
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,290
"We only stopped here because of this old
car."

711
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,340
"Any water here?"

712
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,040
The man pointed to a little house in the distance.

713
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,340
"There's water there."

714
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,490
Tom said, "Well, can we camp here with you?

715
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,540
You have a right to say if you want neighbors
or not."

716
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,720
The thin man's face smiled.

717
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,980
"Sure, come on off the road.

718
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,610
We're happy to have you."

719
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:16,540
Then he called, "Sairy, there are some folks
here that are going to stay with us."

720
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,770
He looked at Tom and added, "Sairy ain't well."

721
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:26,310
The tent opened and a small woman came out.

722
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:30,050
Her face was tired and dry.

723
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,330
When she spoke, her voice was beautiful and
soft.

724
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,480
"Tell them welcome," she said.

725
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,670
Tom drove off the road and brought the truck
into the field beside the car.

726
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,480
The family quickly jumped out of the truck.

727
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,000
Ma went speedily to work.

728
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,920
The man said, "I'm Wilson, Ivy Wilson."

729
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,730
"We're Joads," said Pa.

730
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,870
"Glad to meet you," Mr. Wilson said.

731
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:09,480
Noah and Uncle John and the preacher began
to unload the truck.

732
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,540
They helped Grandpa down and sat him on the
ground.

733
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,680
The old man sat, staring ahead.

734
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,160
"Are you sick, Grandpa?"

735
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,460
Noah asked.

736
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,840
"Yeah, I'm sick," Grandpa said weakly.

737
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,840
Sairy Wilson walked slowly and carefully toward
him.

738
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,710
"How would you like to come into our tent?

739
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,080
You could lie down and rest."

740
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,910
Without warning, Grandpa began to cry.

741
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:49,160
Ma lifted him to his feet and then helped
him into the tent.

742
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,710
Uncle John said, "He must be real sick.

743
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,050
He's never done that before.

744
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,600
I've never seen him cry in his life."

745
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,600
Ma came out of the tent and went to Casy.

746
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,000
"You've been around sick people," she said.

747
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,750
"Please go take a look at Grandpa."

748
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:16,030
Casy walked quickly to the tent and went inside.

749
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:20,720
He took the bony old wrist into his fingers.

750
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,440
"Feeling tired, Grandpa?"

751
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,070
The old man made sounds that were not words.

752
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,300
Ma looked into the tent.

753
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,260
"Grandma wants to come in.

754
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,670
Do you think he's all right?"

755
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,330
Casy shook his head slowly.

756
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,250
Ma said, "He's all right, Grandma.

757
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,630
He's just taking a rest."

758
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,590
Grandma answered, "Well, I want to see him."

759
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:56,280
She came running into the tent and looked
down at her old husband.

760
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,650
"What's the matter with you?"

761
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,490
she asked Grandpa.

762
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:07,140
Casy said gently, "He's sick, Grandma."

763
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,230
"Oh."

764
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,910
She looked down at the old man again.

765
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:14,780
"Sick bad, do you think?"

766
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,100
"Pretty sick, Grandma."

767
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:24,260
The people outside the tent were standing
quietly, listening to the sounds of dying.

768
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,880
Casy looked into Grandpa's eyes.

769
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:34,350
They were clear and deep and there was a knowing
peaceful look about them.

770
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,470
Then, Grandpa's breathing stopped.

771
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:47,060
Sairy took Grandma by the arm and led her
outside and Grandma moved with pride and held

772
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,230
her head high.

773
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,340
Casy stepped out of the tent.

774
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,710
The family sat together on the ground.

775
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,830
Pa was the head of the family now.

776
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:04,150
He looked at Casy and said, "What are we going
to do?

777
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,620
There are laws.

778
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:12,110
You have to report a death, and when you do
that, they either take forty dollars or they

779
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,730
think he's a pauper."

780
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,780
Uncle John said, "We've never been paupers
before."

781
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,990
"Maybe we have to learn," Tom said.

782
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,290
"We never were forced off our land before."

783
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,630
"No.

784
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:36,520
We'll wait for it to get darker, and we'll
bury Grandpa ourselves," Pa said.

785
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,860
On the edge of the ring of firelight the men
gathered.

786
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,260
Pa marked out a place on the ground eight
feet long and three feet wide.

787
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,920
When they finished digging the large hole,
Ma pulled a clear page out of the front of

788
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,500
the Bible and handed it to Tom.

789
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:06,760
He took a pencil out of his pocket and wrote,
"This is William James Joad, died an old,

790
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,300
old man.

791
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:15,030
His folks buried him because they didn't have
enough money for a funeral.

792
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:18,050
Nobody killed him."

793
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:29,140
After the men buried Grandpa and covered the
hole with dirt, the two families sat around

794
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,190
the fire eating the pork and potatoes.

795
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,000
They were all quiet, staring into the fire.

796
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,180
Then Pa said to Mr. Wilson, "How long have
you folks been on the road?"

797
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,270
Wilson cleared his teeth with his tongue and
swallowed.

798
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,440
"We ain't been lucky.

799
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,770
We've been away from home three weeks."

800
00:50:53,770 --> 00:51:01,060
"Well, we plan to be in California in ten
days or less."

801
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,710
Al said, "I don't know, Pa.

802
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,880
With the load we're carrying, we'll be lucky
to get there at all.

803
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,940
Not if there are mountains to go over."

804
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:17,290
Ma said, "Rosasharn, go lie down with Grandma.

805
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,630
She needs somebody now."

806
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:27,040
Rosasharn got to her feet and walked to the
old bed and lay beside Grandma.

807
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,210
The two whispered together.

808
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,810
Al said, "It's a shame about Grandpa.

809
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,520
Before we left, he was talking about what
he was going to do in California."

810
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,560
"He was pretending all the time," Casy said.

811
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,530
"I think he knew.

812
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:49,330
He didn't die tonight.

813
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:53,380
He died the minute you took him off the place."

814
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,950
"Are you sure of that?"

815
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:56,980
Pa cried.

816
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,170
"Oh, he was breathing, but he was dead.

817
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:06,530
He was that place, and he knew it."

818
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,790
Uncle John asked, "You knew he was dying?"

819
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:16,330
Casy said, "Yeah, but we couldn't do anything.

820
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,430
We had to go and he knew it.

821
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,090
And he didn't suffer.

822
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,420
He's just staying with the land.

823
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,260
He couldn't leave it."

824
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:33,030
Wilson said, "Yeah, we had to leave my brother
Will.

825
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,440
He couldn't leave the land, and we couldn't
wait.

826
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,990
So, we went one hundred miles when the car
broke down.

827
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,820
It cost thirty dollars to get it fixed.

828
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:50,610
And then we had to get a tire, and then Sairy
got sick.

829
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:55,020
Had to stop for ten days.

830
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,400
And now the car's broken again and money's
getting low.

831
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,380
I don't know when we'll ever get to California.

832
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:06,860
If I could only fix a car, but I don't know
anything about cars."

833
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,090
"What's the matter with it?"

834
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,090
Al asked.

835
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,630
"Runs a minute, and then stops."

836
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,490
Al spoke proudly.

837
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,730
"I think you have a blocked gas line.

838
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,000
I'll blow it out for you."

839
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,560
And Pa was proud, too.

840
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,810
"He's good with a car."

841
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:30,600
"Well, thank you for your help," Wilson said
to Al.

842
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:37,310
"Yeah, when we get to California we'll buy
a new car that doesn't break down."

843
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:41,260
"When we get there," Pa said.

844
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,920
"The problem is getting there."

845
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,410
"Oh, but it'll be worth it," said Wilson.

846
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:53,070
"I've seen handbills that say they need folks
for picking and for good wages.

847
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:57,870
They don't care how much you eat because they
have plenty.

848
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:03,670
And I bet in a couple of years a fellow could
have a place of his own."

849
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,980
Pa said, "We've seen those handbills.

850
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,260
I have one right here."

851
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:14,230
He took out his wallet and unfolded an orange
handbill.

852
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:19,280
In black type it said: "Pea Pickers Wanted
in California.

853
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,730
Good Wages All Season. 800 Pickers Wanted."

854
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:29,430
Wilson looked at it curiously "That's the
one I've seen.

855
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,750
The exact same one.

856
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,990
Do you suppose they have all eight hundred
already?"

857
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:41,540
Pa said, "This is just one little part of
California.

858
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,580
There are plenty of other places."

859
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,700
Then Tom said, "I've been thinking.

860
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,150
We have an overloaded truck, but Mr. and Mrs.
Wilson don't.

861
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:59,330
If some of us could ride with them and take
some of their light stuff in the truck, we

862
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,380
could get up hills.

863
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:06,830
We'd keep together on the road and it would
be good for everybody"

864
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,830
Wilson jumped up.

865
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:09,830
"Sure.

866
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,330
That would be great.

867
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:13,830
Did you hear that, Sairy?"

868
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,680
"It's a nice thing," Sairy said.

869
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,390
"I hope we aren't troubling you folks."

870
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:24,210
"You'd be helping us," Pa said.

871
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,810
Ma said, "You helped us with Grandpa.

872
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,710
Now we'll help you."

873
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,630
The relationship was plain.

874
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:37,800
Al cried, "That car will easily take six."

875
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,950
Sairy said, "If I get sick again, you have
to go on and get there."

876
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:52,190
Ma looked carefully at Sairy and said, "We're
going to see that you get through."

877
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,590
Sairy stared into the firelight.

878
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:58,260
"We have to get some sleep tonight."

879
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,460
She stood up.

880
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:07,370
"Grandpa - it's like he's been dead a year,"
Ma said sadly.

881
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:12,310
The families moved lazily to their sleep.

882
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,430
Only Sairy Wilson lay awake.

883
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:22,310
She stared into the sky and held her body
firmly against the pain.

884
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,670
CHAPTER FOUR

885
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,040
Mechanical Problems

886
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:34,190
Joads and Wilsons slowly moved west along
66 as a team.

887
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:41,900
That night they ate only pieces of bread,
cold and hard, left from breakfast.

888
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:50,750
For two days, the families were in flight,
out of Oklahoma and across Texas.

889
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:58,090
Al drove the car, and his mother sat beside
him and Rosasharn beside her.

890
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,980
The Wilsons sat quietly in the back.

891
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:08,890
"Ma," the girl said, "when we get there, all
of you are going to pick fruit and live in

892
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,480
the country, ain't you?"

893
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,830
Ma smiled.

894
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,890
"We ain't there yet.

895
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,950
We don't know what it's like."

896
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:22,190
"Me and Connie don't want to live in the country,"
the girl said.

897
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,890
"We have it all planned."

898
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:30,020
For a moment a little worry came on Ma's face.

899
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:36,070
"Ain't you going to stay with us - with the
family?"

900
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,940
"Well, Connie and me talked about it.

901
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,320
Ma, we want to live in a town."

902
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,680
She went on excitedly.

903
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,160
"Connie's going to get a job in a store or
maybe a factory.

904
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,030
And he's going to study at home.

905
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,880
And maybe later he'll have his own store.

906
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,730
And we'll go to the movies whenever we want."

907
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:04,270
Her face shone with excitement.

908
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:10,760
"And when Connie gets his store, Al could
work for him."

909
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,890
Ma said, "We don't want you to go away from
us.

910
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:18,930
It ain't good for folks to break up."

911
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,420
Al said, "Me work for Connie?

912
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,300
How about Connie working for me?"

913
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,370
A noise could be heard in the engine.

914
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:34,600
Al speeded up and the banging noise grew louder.

915
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,790
He drove the car to the side of the road.

916
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:43,210
Tom stopped the truck close to the car and
jumped out.

917
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,550
"What's the matter, Al?"

918
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,070
"Listen to this," Al said.

919
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:54,940
He turned on the engine and a loud banging
sound filled the air.

920
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,230
Tom listened.

921
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,610
"That doesn't sound good."

922
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,330
"I kept plenty of oil in there."

923
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,130
"Well, it's all dry now," Tom said.

924
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,470
"And we'll have to change that part."

925
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:11,300
He pointed with his finger.

926
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,470
Al whispered angrily to himself.

927
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:19,990
He drove the car into the shade and shut down
the engine.

928
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:26,590
The Wilsons and the Joads slowly got out of
the truck and the car.

929
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:30,420
Wilson said, "It's all my fault.

930
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,170
This stupid car has been trouble from the
start.

931
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,410
You folks have been nice to us.

932
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:40,970
You just pack up and get along.

933
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,720
Sairy and I will stay here."

934
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,750
Pa said slowly, "We ain't going to do that.

935
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,370
We're almost family.

936
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,660
Grandpa died in your tent."

937
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:59,430
Sairy said tiredly, "We've only been trouble."

938
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,900
Tom slowly made a cigarette and lighted it.

939
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,420
He took off his ruined cap and wiped his forehead.

940
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,070
"I have an idea," he said.

941
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:17,410
"The nearer we get to California, the quicker
we can be earning money.

942
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:22,580
Now this car will go twice as fast as that
truck.

943
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:29,210
You take some of the stuff out of the truck,
and then all of you folks can move on and

944
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,430
Casy and I will stay and fix this car.

945
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:38,690
And then we'll drive on, day and night, and
we'll catch up with you.

946
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:44,630
If you get through first, you'll be working
and things will be easy."

947
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:47,570
The family considered it.

948
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:50,630
Pa scratched the earth with his finger.

949
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:54,540
"I think Tom's right," he said.

950
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,470
"It's no good for all of us to stay here.

951
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:04,240
We can get fifty, a hundred miles before dark."

952
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,740
Ma said worriedly, "How are you going to find
us?"

953
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,340
"We'll be on the same road," said Tom.

954
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,500
"Sixty-six all the way.

955
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Go to a place called Bakersfield.

956
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,680
I've seen it on the map.

957
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,140
You go straight there."

958
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:29,340
"Looks like a very big place on the map,"
said Ma.

959
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:36,820
"But if we all lie around here, there's no
water and we can't move this car.

960
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:44,040
If you all get out there and start work, you'll
all have money and maybe a house to five in.

961
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,140
How about it, Casy?

962
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,380
Do you want to stay here with me?"

963
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,680
"I'll do whatever you all think," Casy said.

964
01:01:50,680 --> 01:02:01,470
Pa said, "Well, maybe we could do a hundred
miles before we stop."

965
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:03,660
Ma stepped in front of him.

966
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,460
"I ain't going."

967
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,170
Pa was surprised at her.

968
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:12,411
"What do you mean?

969
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:13,411
You have to go.

970
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:15,890
You have to look after the family"

971
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:20,470
Ma went to the back of the car and took a
large hammer from the floor.

972
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:26,920
She held it up in her hand and said, "I ain't
going to go."

973
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,510
"I tell you, you have to go.

974
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,070
We've made up our minds."

975
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:40,190
"Well, you're going to have to beat me first,"
she cried, holding the hammer higher in the

976
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,190
air.

977
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,470
Ruthie and Winfield laughed.

978
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:48,760
Pa looked helplessly around the group.

979
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,100
"Ma," Tom said.

980
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,660
"What's wrong?

981
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,770
Have you gone crazy?"

982
01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:01,170
Ma's face softened, but her eyes were still
full of anger.

983
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,850
"What have we got left in the world?

984
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,850
Just us.

985
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,690
Just the folks.

986
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:10,760
You want to break up the family."

987
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,480
Tom cried, "Ma, we'll catch up with you.

988
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:19,740
We ain't going to be a long time."

989
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,510
Ma waved the large hammer in the air.

990
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:26,880
"And if we camp and you drive by?

991
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,290
Or if we get through - how will we tell you?

992
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,300
How will you know who to ask?"

993
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:38,130
Uncle John said, "But we could be making some
money."

994
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:42,780
The eyes of the whole family moved back to
Ma.

995
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,220
"The money wouldn't do any good," she said.

996
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,880
"We need family."

997
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,380
Tom said calmly, "Ma, we can't camp here.

998
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,420
There's no water.

999
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,290
And Grandma needs shade."

1000
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,000
"All right," she said.

1001
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,540
"We'll go along.

1002
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:09,580
We'll stop at the first place where there's
water and shade.

1003
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:16,270
And the truck will come back and take you
into town to get your part and it will take

1004
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,270
you back.

1005
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,950
Then we'll wait for you."

1006
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:25,500
Tom looked at Pa, and then said, "All right,
Ma.

1007
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,730
You win.

1008
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:32,700
Now put that thing down before you hurt someone."

1009
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,430
Ma looked surprised at the large hammer in
her hand.

1010
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:41,920
She dropped her weapon on the ground, and
Tom carefully picked it up.

1011
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:49,710
He said, "Al, you drive the folks on and get
them camped, and then you bring the truck

1012
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,710
back here.

1013
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:54,690
Me and the preacher will get that part off."

1014
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:59,830
Al loaded the family back on the truck.

1015
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:05,630
Tom had already gone under the car when the
family drove off.

1016
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:11,120
He said to the preacher, "Casy, you've been
quiet these last few days.

1017
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,860
What's the matter?"

1018
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:17,730
Casy stretched out on his stomach, looking
under the car.

1019
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:22,120
"I did a lifetime's talking when I was a preacher."

1020
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,380
Tom made a few loud noises with the tools.

1021
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,340
"There it is," he said.

1022
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:36,880
The two men got to their feet and then sat
under the shade of a large advertising sign.

1023
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:46,420
Casy said, "Tom, I've been watching the cars
on the road, those we passed and those that

1024
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,600
passed us.

1025
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,240
It's like they're running away from soldiers.

1026
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,320
It's like the whole country is moving."

1027
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,390
"Yeah," Tom said.

1028
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,790
"The whole country is moving."

1029
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:04,090
"Well, what's going to happen if they can't
get jobs out there?"

1030
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,060
"Oh, I don't know," Tom cried.

1031
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,350
"I'm just putting one foot in front of the
other.

1032
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:13,250
I did that for four years in McAlester."

1033
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:17,860
"Yeah, maybe that's the best way."

1034
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,980
"Ain't that Al coming?"

1035
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,230
Tom asked.

1036
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,430
"Yeah.

1037
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:28,910
Looks like it."

1038
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,910
Tom stood up.

1039
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:30,910
The truck arrived.

1040
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:31,910
Tom shouted, "What took you so long?

1041
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:33,450
Did you have to go far?"

1042
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:38,960
"We had a mess," Al said.

1043
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,610
"Grandma started crying.

1044
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:41,610
Then, Rosasharn started."

1045
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:42,910
"Where did you leave them?"

1046
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,010
Tom asked.

1047
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:46,550
"Well, we found a camp.

1048
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:49,020
It has shade and water.

1049
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,560
Cost half a dollar to stay there.

1050
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,860
But Ma says we have to stay there because
Grandma's tired.

1051
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,720
We have the Wilsons' tent up.

1052
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,290
I think Grandma's going crazy."

1053
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:05,960
Tom looked at the lowering sun.

1054
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:13,540
"Casy," he said, "somebody has to stay with
this car."

1055
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,540
"Sure, I'll stay."

1056
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,130
Al took a paper bag from the seat.

1057
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:22,440
"Here's some bread and meat Ma sent, and I
have a bottle of water here."

1058
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,540
Tom got in the truck beside Al and the two
drove off.

1059
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:35,140
Soon they were at the edge of town, and there
on the right was a yard full of old cars,

1060
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:40,440
engines rusting on the ground, truck sides,
wheels, twisted iron.

1061
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:48,020
Al drove the truck up to an old house and
Tom got out and looked into the doorway.

1062
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,490
"Don't see anyone," Tom said.

1063
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:54,690
"Anybody here?" he called out.

1064
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:57,710
"I hope they have a '25 Dodge."

1065
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:03,880
Behind the house a door shut and a one-eyed
man came out.

1066
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:12,390
He was thin and dirty and his jeans and shirt
were thick and shiny with oil.

1067
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,510
Tom asked, "Are you the boss?"

1068
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,029
"I work for the boss."

1069
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:19,670
The one eye looked at them.

1070
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,730
"What do you want?"

1071
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:25,349
"Do you have an old '25 Dodge?

1072
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:31,079
We need a part like this," Tom explained,
holding the part in his hand.

1073
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,339
"I don't know.

1074
01:08:33,339 --> 01:08:35,809
The boss could tell you, but he went home."

1075
01:08:35,809 --> 01:08:39,089
"Can we look and see?"

1076
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:42,690
"Sure, I don't care."

1077
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:46,069
Tom and Al walked among the old cars.

1078
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:50,179
The sun disappeared behind the mountains.

1079
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:51,179
Al looked around.

1080
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:53,389
"Over there, look, Tom!

1081
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:57,480
That looks like a '25 or '26."

1082
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:03,089
They walked over to the rusting car, resting
on flat tires.

1083
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:06,900
"Sure, it's a '25," Al cried.

1084
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,239
"Can we take a part from it, mister?"

1085
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:14,179
Tom kneeled down and looked under the car.

1086
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:16,589
He then slid under it.

1087
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:21,949
The one-eyed man said, "I'll get you a box
of tools."

1088
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:28,230
Together Tom and Al removed a piece from the
engine and got to the part that they needed.

1089
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,989
There was a bang of metal.

1090
01:09:30,989 --> 01:09:33,279
"I got it," Al said.

1091
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,600
"And I got some rings we could use, too."

1092
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,519
Tom stood up and wiped his face and looked
at the part.

1093
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:44,059
"It looks OK to me.

1094
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:47,279
How much will that be, mister?"

1095
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,599
The one-eyed man brought out a flashlight
and shone it on a book full of the names of

1096
01:09:52,599 --> 01:09:54,840
parts and their prices.

1097
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,239
"I don't know exactly.

1098
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:01,620
If the boss were here, he'd be able to tell
you.

1099
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,420
How about a dollar?"

1100
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,949
"All right," Tom said.

1101
01:10:04,949 --> 01:10:07,949
"And what will you take for that flashlight?"

1102
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:13,590
"Well, it isn't very good - oh, thirty-five
cents."

1103
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,760
Tom handed over the silver coins.

1104
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:24,929
He and Al got into the truck, and as they
drove off Tom shouted, "Bye."

1105
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,079
The truck went noisily along the road.

1106
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:34,289
Al said, "Tom, did you hear Connie talking
about studying at nights.

1107
01:10:34,289 --> 01:10:39,160
I've been thinking that maybe I'd study at
nights, too.

1108
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,110
Learn about radio or engines.

1109
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:45,150
A fellow might get started that way."

1110
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,060
"Maybe," Tom said.

1111
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:51,969
"There were fellows taking lessons by mail
in McAlester.

1112
01:10:51,969 --> 01:10:54,090
I've never known one of them that finished.

1113
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,699
They got tired of it."

1114
01:10:56,699 --> 01:11:04,739
They fell into silence and the dark came and
the stars were sharp and white.

1115
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:12,590
When the truck arrived, Casy got out of the
back seat of the car and walked to the side

1116
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,590
of the road.

1117
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:18,260
"I never expected you so soon," he said.

1118
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:21,059
Tom gathered the parts in a sack.

1119
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:23,260
"We were lucky," he said.

1120
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,630
"Got a flashlight, too.

1121
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,530
We're going to fix it right up."

1122
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:31,469
The men got to work on the car.

1123
01:11:31,469 --> 01:11:34,480
Casy knelt down and took the flashlight.

1124
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,070
He kept the beam on the working hands.

1125
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:43,789
Tom held the part in place while Al tightened
the screws.

1126
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:47,190
"I guess that's it," Tom said.

1127
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,090
They got out from under the car.

1128
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:53,010
"OK, Al, try starting it."

1129
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:57,480
Al got into the car and stepped on the starter.

1130
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,539
The motor banged.

1131
01:11:59,539 --> 01:12:01,730
Blue smoke poured out of the back.

1132
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:05,510
"It'll burn oil like that for a few seconds.

1133
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,720
It'll be OK.

1134
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,849
Turn it off now.

1135
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:11,929
Let's get some dinner."

1136
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:14,489
"You'd make a good mechanic," Al said to Tom.

1137
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:18,639
"Well, I worked in a shop for a year.

1138
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,340
We'll drive real slowly for a couple of hundred
miles."

1139
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:29,739
Tom and Al quickly ate the boiled pork and
drank the water from the bottle.

1140
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:32,679
When they finished, Tom said, "All right.

1141
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:34,869
I'll drive the car.

1142
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:36,860
You bring the truck, Al."

1143
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:42,300
The preacher got in the car and Tom started
the engine.

1144
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:51,060
There was a small wooden house in the middle
of the campground and on the porch of the

1145
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,809
house a light beamed into a large circle.

1146
01:12:54,809 --> 01:13:00,550
Half a dozen tents were near the house and
cars stood beside the tents.

1147
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:04,170
A group of men had gathered on the porch.

1148
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:08,329
Tom drove the car to the side of the road
and parked.

1149
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:11,280
Al went through the gate in the truck.

1150
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,909
"No need to take this one in," Tom said.

1151
01:13:14,909 --> 01:13:17,679
He got out and walked through the gate.

1152
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:23,480
The owner dropped his front chair legs to
the floor and leaned forward.

1153
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,560
"You men want to camp here?"

1154
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,800
"No," Tom said.

1155
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,699
"We have folks here.

1156
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:32,360
Hi, Pa."

1157
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:37,500
Pa, seated on the bottom step, said, "Did
you get her fixed?"

1158
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,409
"We were lucky," Tom said.

1159
01:13:39,409 --> 01:13:41,179
"Got a part before dark."

1160
01:13:41,179 --> 01:13:44,510
"Ma's worried," Pa said.

1161
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,510
"Your Grandma's gone crazy."

1162
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:50,219
"Yeah, Al told me.

1163
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,130
Is she any better now?"

1164
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,849
"Well, she's sleeping."

1165
01:13:53,849 --> 01:14:01,090
The owner said, "If you want to bring the
car in and camp, it will cost you fifty cents.

1166
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:05,369
You get a place to camp and water and wood."

1167
01:14:05,369 --> 01:14:07,280
"What?" said Tom.

1168
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,610
"We can sleep right beside the road and it
won't cost a thing."

1169
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:15,530
The owner said, "But the sheriff comes by
at night.

1170
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:17,519
He'll make it hard for you.

1171
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,780
We have a law against sleeping out in this
state.

1172
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:23,050
We have a law about trespassers."

1173
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:28,179
"If I pay you half a dollar, I'm not a trespasser?"

1174
01:14:28,179 --> 01:14:29,179
Tom said.

1175
01:14:29,179 --> 01:14:30,179
"That's right.

1176
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,909
Ain't you got half a dollar?"

1177
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:34,949
Tom's eyes stared angrily.

1178
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:38,159
"Yeah, but I'm going to need it.

1179
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,449
I can't use it just for sleeping."

1180
01:14:40,449 --> 01:14:46,030
"Well, we all have to make a living," the
owner said.

1181
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:49,389
Pa said, "We'll get moving early.

1182
01:14:49,389 --> 01:14:52,429
Look, mister, we paid.

1183
01:14:52,429 --> 01:14:55,710
This fellow is a part of our family Can't
he stay?

1184
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:56,790
We paid."

1185
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,829
"Half a dollar a car," the owner said.

1186
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:05,860
"We'll drive along the road and meet you in
the morning," Tom said to Pa.

1187
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:11,989
He made a thin cigarette and added, "We'll
go along soon."

1188
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:17,330
Pa said to the other men in the circle, "We
used to be farmers.

1189
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:19,019
Worked all of our lives."

1190
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:23,869
Near the edge of the porch a ragged man stood.

1191
01:15:23,869 --> 01:15:27,769
His black coat hung in long pieces.

1192
01:15:27,769 --> 01:15:32,619
He said to Pa, "You folks must have a nice
little pot of money."

1193
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:36,079
"No, we don't have any money, now," Pa said.

1194
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:41,760
"But there are plenty of us able to work and
we're all good men!

1195
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,480
We'll get good wages out west."

1196
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:51,599
The ragged man stared while Pa spoke, and
then he laughed.

1197
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:53,520
The circle of faces turned to him.

1198
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,719
The laughing got out of control and turned
into coughing.

1199
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,510
His eyes became red and watery.

1200
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,260
"You're going out there?"

1201
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,099
The laughing started again.

1202
01:16:06,099 --> 01:16:09,949
He stopped himself "Picking oranges?

1203
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:12,260
Or maybe peaches?"

1204
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:15,829
Pa said, "We're going to take what they have.

1205
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:18,349
They have lots of work."

1206
01:16:18,349 --> 01:16:22,389
The ragged man said, "Me - I'm coming back.

1207
01:16:22,389 --> 01:16:24,320
I've been there."

1208
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,100
The faces turned quickly toward him.

1209
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,600
The men became stiff.

1210
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,239
The ragged man looked at their faces.

1211
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:37,070
"I'm going back home to die of hunger.

1212
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:40,150
I'd rather die all at once."

1213
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:43,060
Pa said, "What are you talking about?

1214
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:47,639
I have a handbill that says there are good
wages.

1215
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:51,869
And I read that they need folks to pick fruit."

1216
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:53,849
The ragged man turned to Pa.

1217
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:58,559
"Do you have any place to go back home?"

1218
01:16:58,559 --> 01:16:59,719
"No," said Pa.

1219
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:00,719
"We're out.

1220
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,750
They put a tractor past the house."

1221
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,980
"You wouldn't go back then?"

1222
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:06,980
"Of course not."

1223
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:12,000
"Then I'm not going to worry you," said the
ragged man.

1224
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
"Handbills?

1225
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,699
They need men?

1226
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:19,110
But you don't know what kind of men they need."

1227
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:22,250
"What are you talking about?"

1228
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,360
"Look," said the man.

1229
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,280
"This fellow wants eight hundred men.

1230
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:33,690
So, he prints five thousand of those things
and maybe twenty thousand people see them.

1231
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:38,860
And maybe two or three thousand folks start
moving because of this handbill."

1232
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:42,290
"But it doesn't make any sense!"

1233
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:43,290
Pa cried.

1234
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:46,900
"Not until you see the fellow that put out
the handbill.

1235
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,449
You'll see him, or someone who works for him.

1236
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:56,920
Maybe he needs two hundred men, so he talks
to five hundred, and they tell other folks,

1237
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:04,500
and when you get to the place, there are a
thousand men.

1238
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,360
Then the fellow says, 'I'm paying twenty cents
an hour.'

1239
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,170
And maybe half the men walk off.

1240
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:14,320
But there are still five hundred that are
so hungry they work for bread.

1241
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,820
Do you see now?

1242
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:23,449
If he can get a lot of men, hungry men, he
can pay them less."

1243
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:27,239
The faces in the circle looked coldly at the
man.

1244
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,489
"Let me tell you.

1245
01:18:29,489 --> 01:18:31,010
Ask him what he's going to pay.

1246
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:35,660
Ask him to write down what he's going to pay."

1247
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,440
The owner said, "He's just lying.

1248
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:43,660
There's plenty of them going around getting
people mad."

1249
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:48,139
The ragged man said, "Well, I tried to tell
you folks.

1250
01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:53,099
I guess you'll have to find out for yourselves."

1251
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:55,570
The circle was quiet.

1252
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:01,679
The man looked around and then he turned and
walked away into the darkness.

1253
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,619
Pa said, "Do you think he's telling the truth?"

1254
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:10,460
The preacher answered, "He's telling the truth,
all right.

1255
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,039
The truth for him."

1256
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,050
"How about us?"

1257
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,050
Tom demanded.

1258
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,199
"Is that the truth for us?"

1259
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,050
"I don't know," said Casy.

1260
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:24,469
"I don't know," said Pa.

1261
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:28,289
They walked to the tent and Ma came out to
meet them.

1262
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:31,800
"All sleeping," she said.

1263
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,590
"Grandma finally fell asleep."

1264
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:37,219
Then she saw Tom.

1265
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:40,340
"Is everything all right, Tom?"

1266
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,340
"Yeah.

1267
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,550
We got it fixed," said Tom.

1268
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:45,170
"We're ready to go."

1269
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:49,440
"Thank dear God for that," she said.

1270
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,699
Pa cleared his throat.

1271
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:54,829
"A fellow was just saying..."

1272
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:56,090
Tom touched his arm.

1273
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,541
"Funny what he says," Tom said.

1274
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:03,489
"He said that there are lots of folks on the
way."

1275
01:20:03,489 --> 01:20:05,860
Ma looked at them in the darkness.

1276
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,269
"We'll go now.

1277
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:11,699
We'll stop by the road on the right-hand side.

1278
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:12,699
Night, Ma."

1279
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:13,699
CHAPTER FIVE

1280
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:14,770
The Roadside Camps

1281
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:25,239
The cars of the migrant people came slowly
out of the side roads onto the great cross-country

1282
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:26,239
highway.

1283
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:32,719
In the daylight, they hurried to the west,
and as the dark caught them, they grouped

1284
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,219
near to shelter and water.

1285
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:42,429
It might be that one family camped near water,
and another camped for the water and some

1286
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:48,090
company, and a third because two families
found it good.

1287
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:52,420
And when the sun came down, maybe twenty families
were there.

1288
01:20:52,420 --> 01:21:00,940
In the evening, a strange thing happened - the
twenty families became one family; the children

1289
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,900
were the children of all.

1290
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:09,969
The Joad family moved slowly up into the mountains
of New Mexico.

1291
01:21:09,969 --> 01:21:14,039
They climbed into the high country of Arizona.

1292
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:17,309
There a border guard stopped them.

1293
01:21:17,309 --> 01:21:19,909
"Where are you going?"

1294
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:22,179
"To California," said Tom.

1295
01:21:22,179 --> 01:21:24,790
"How long do you plan to be in Arizona?"

1296
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,889
"Long enough to get across."

1297
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:31,079
The guard stuck a sign on the windshield.

1298
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:32,079
"OK.

1299
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:35,969
Go ahead, but you'd better keep moving."

1300
01:21:35,969 --> 01:21:36,969
"Sure.

1301
01:21:36,969 --> 01:21:39,449
We plan to."

1302
01:21:39,449 --> 01:21:46,929
They drove up and down hills, and finally
to a great flat area that was all desert.

1303
01:21:46,929 --> 01:21:51,719
They drove all night and came to the mountains
in the night.

1304
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,350
When the daylight came, they saw the Colorado
River below them.

1305
01:21:55,350 --> 01:22:01,309
They were stopped at the bridge, and a guard
washed the sign off their windshield.

1306
01:22:01,309 --> 01:22:06,070
They crossed the bridge, and finally stopped.

1307
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:11,989
Pa called, "We're here - we're in California!"

1308
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:14,250
They looked at the broken rock.

1309
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,349
"We've got to the desert," Tom said.

1310
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:20,510
"We have to get water and rest."

1311
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:27,699
The Joads and Wilsons drove to the river,
and they sat in the cars looking at the beautiful

1312
01:22:27,699 --> 01:22:29,260
water going by.

1313
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:33,210
There was a family camping near the river.

1314
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:39,059
Tom leaned his head out of the truck and said,
"Can we stop here?"

1315
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:41,480
A heavy woman looked up.

1316
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,900
"We don't own it, mister.

1317
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,900
Stop if you want.

1318
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,699
A cop will be down to have a look at you."

1319
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:53,080
The two cars parked in a clear place on the
grass.

1320
01:22:53,080 --> 01:23:00,579
The tents were passed down, the Wilson tent
put up, the Joads' stretched over a rope.

1321
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:05,570
Winfield and Ruthie walked slowly down through
the tall grass.

1322
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:09,130
Ruthie said, "This is California!

1323
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,050
And we're right in it."

1324
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:16,510
Then the two children walked into the water
and stood quietly.

1325
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:22,289
They heard Ma calling, "Ruthie, Winfield!

1326
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,820
You come back!"

1327
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:28,030
Tom said, "I'm going to go down and take a
bath.

1328
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,749
That's what I'm going to do - before I sleep.

1329
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:34,550
How's Grandma since we got her in the tent?"

1330
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:37,249
"Don't know," said Pa.

1331
01:23:37,249 --> 01:23:39,179
"I couldn't seem to wake her up."

1332
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:46,610
A crying sound came from the tent, and Ma
went inside quickly.

1333
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:49,650
"She's woken up," Noah said.

1334
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,920
"She's out of her senses."

1335
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,449
Tom said, "She's exhausted.

1336
01:23:55,449 --> 01:24:00,540
If she doesn't get some rest soon, she's not
going to get there."

1337
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:04,870
He moved away and the other men followed him.

1338
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:10,699
They took off their clothes and walked into
the water and sat down.

1339
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:14,300
Uncle John put his head under the water for
a few seconds.

1340
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,559
"Well, we're here.

1341
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:18,380
This is California."

1342
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:22,630
"We still have to cross the desert," said
Tom.

1343
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,599
"And I hear it's hell."

1344
01:24:24,599 --> 01:24:28,809
Noah asked, "Are you going to try tonight?"

1345
01:24:28,809 --> 01:24:31,050
"What do you think, Pa?"

1346
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,159
Tom asked.

1347
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,380
"Well, I don't know.

1348
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:38,099
It will do us good to get a little rest, especially
Grandma.

1349
01:24:38,099 --> 01:24:43,010
But I'd like to cross it and get settled in
a job.

1350
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:45,550
Only got about forty dollars left.

1351
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:50,850
I'll feel better when we're working and a
little money is coming in."

1352
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:56,199
Noah said lazily, "I'd just like to stay here.

1353
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:58,940
To lie here forever."

1354
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:03,940
Pa said, "Wait until we get to California.

1355
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,960
You'll see nice country then."

1356
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:13,659
"Pa, this is California!"

1357
01:25:13,659 --> 01:25:18,070
Two men dressed in jeans and blue shirts came
through the bushes.

1358
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:20,820
"Do you mind if we come in?"

1359
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,650
"It ain't our river," Pa said.

1360
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:30,190
The two men shook off their pants and their
shirts and stepped out into the water.

1361
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:34,300
They were a father and his boy.

1362
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,380
Pa asked, "Going west?"

1363
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,380
"No.

1364
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,880
We've just come from there.

1365
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,949
We're going back home.

1366
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:43,510
Can't make a living out there."

1367
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:46,470
Pa asked, "You can't?"

1368
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,470
"No.

1369
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:52,389
But at least we can die from hunger with folks
we know.

1370
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:56,030
We won't have a lot of fellows hating us."

1371
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:59,769
Pa said, "What makes them hate you?"

1372
01:25:59,769 --> 01:26:02,289
"Don't know," said the man.

1373
01:26:02,289 --> 01:26:05,400
"You ain't never been in California?"

1374
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,929
"No, we ain't."

1375
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:10,079
"Well, don't take my word.

1376
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:11,929
Go see for yourself.

1377
01:26:11,929 --> 01:26:14,909
Yes, it's a nice country.

1378
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:17,510
All valleys and fruit.

1379
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,120
But you can't have any of that.

1380
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,830
That belongs to a Land and Cattle Company.

1381
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:28,239
And if they don't want to work it, it ain't
going to get worked.

1382
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:33,070
If you go in there and plant a little corn,
you'll go to jail!"

1383
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:34,420
"Good land?

1384
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:37,810
And they ain't working it?"

1385
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:39,840
"Yes, that's right.

1386
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,010
And I'll tell you something - they hate you.

1387
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:46,699
You haven't been called an 'Oakie' yet."

1388
01:26:46,699 --> 01:26:48,630
Tom said, "Oakie?

1389
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:50,510
What's that?"

1390
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:55,250
"Well, Oakie used to mean you were from Oklahoma.

1391
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,610
Now it means you're a dirty nothing.

1392
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:00,820
But I can't tell you anything.

1393
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:03,820
You have to go there."

1394
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,170
The man looked at his son and laughed.

1395
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:09,079
"You ain't going to get any steady work.

1396
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:11,929
You're going to work hard for your dinner.

1397
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:17,699
And you're going to do it with people looking
mean at you."

1398
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:23,610
Pa asked slowly, "Ain't it nice out there
at all?"

1399
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:29,809
"Sure, nice to look at, but you can't have
any of it."

1400
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:32,599
The sun was flaming down now.

1401
01:27:32,599 --> 01:27:38,610
"If a fellow's willing to work hard, can't
he make it?"

1402
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:39,969
Pa asked.

1403
01:27:39,969 --> 01:27:42,869
The man sat up and faced him.

1404
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:46,530
"Mister, I don't know everything.

1405
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:51,020
You might go out there and fall into a steady
job, and I'd be telling lies.

1406
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:55,820
And then you might not ever get any work.

1407
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,929
A fellow doesn't know everything."

1408
01:27:57,929 --> 01:28:02,679
Pa turned his head and looked at Uncle John.

1409
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:06,499
"What do you think about all of this?"

1410
01:28:06,499 --> 01:28:10,599
Uncle John said, "I don't know anything about
it.

1411
01:28:10,599 --> 01:28:12,219
We're going there, ain't we?

1412
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:15,050
None of this talk is going to stop us going."

1413
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:19,010
"Yeah," Pa said.

1414
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:24,600
"Well, I'm going over there to get some sleep
then."

1415
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,940
Tom stood up and walked to the sandy shore.

1416
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:33,989
He slipped his clothes on his wet body, walked
among the bushes, and lay down.

1417
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:35,550
Noah followed him.

1418
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:36,650
"Tom."

1419
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,760
"Yeah?"

1420
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,280
"Tom, I ain't going on."

1421
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,280
Tom sat up.

1422
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,659
"What do you mean?"

1423
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:51,290
"Tom, I ain't going to leave this water.

1424
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,289
I'm going to walk on down this river."

1425
01:28:53,289 --> 01:28:56,940
"You're crazy," Tom said.

1426
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,050
"I'll get a piece of line.

1427
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,480
I'll catch fish.

1428
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:05,300
A fellow can't go hungry beside a nice river."

1429
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:08,510
Tom said, "How about the family?

1430
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,660
How about Ma?"

1431
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,579
"I can't help it.

1432
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:15,820
I can't leave this water.

1433
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:18,219
You know how it is, Tom.

1434
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:20,570
You know how the folks are nice to me.

1435
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:24,139
But they don't really care for me."

1436
01:29:24,139 --> 01:29:25,739
"You're crazy."

1437
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:27,790
"No, I ain't.

1438
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:29,989
I know how I am.

1439
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:32,269
I know they're sorry.

1440
01:29:32,269 --> 01:29:34,400
But, I ain't going.

1441
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,040
You tell Ma, Tom."

1442
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,829
"Now listen to me," Tom began.

1443
01:29:39,829 --> 01:29:41,170
"No.

1444
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:43,449
I was in that water.

1445
01:29:43,449 --> 01:29:47,040
And I ain't going to leave it.

1446
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,289
I'm going now, Tom - down the river.

1447
01:29:50,289 --> 01:29:52,199
I'll catch fish.

1448
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:54,449
I can't leave it.

1449
01:29:54,449 --> 01:29:56,980
I can't."

1450
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:59,030
He stepped out of the bushes.

1451
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:03,210
"You tell Ma, Tom."

1452
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,550
He walked away.

1453
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:08,840
Tom followed him to the river.

1454
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:13,030
"Listen, you stupid fool."

1455
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,119
"I'm sad.

1456
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:16,472
But I can't help it.

1457
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:19,070
I have to go."

1458
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,630
He walked along the shore.

1459
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:25,650
Tom started to follow and then he stopped.

1460
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:33,030
He watched Noah growing smaller on the edge
of the river, until he disappeared from sight.

1461
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:39,080
And Tom took off his cap and scratched his
head.

1462
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:45,410
He went back and lay down to sleep.

1463
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:55,450
In the tent Grandma lay on the bed, and Ma
sat beside her, and Rosasharn sat on the other

1464
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,320
side and watched her mother.

1465
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:03,239
"Told him to come right here," Grandma said.

1466
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:05,530
"I'll catch him."

1467
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:10,599
She closed her eyes and rolled her head from
side to side.

1468
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:14,020
Rosasharn looked helplessly at the old woman.

1469
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:18,590
She said softly, "She's awfully sick."

1470
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:25,760
Grandma kicked off the blanket with her legs,
which lay like gray, knotted sticks.

1471
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:33,810
And then her breathing grew steady and easy,
and she slept deeply and breathed through

1472
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,639
her half-opened mouth.

1473
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:42,219
The girl lay down on the edge of the bed and
closed her eyes.

1474
01:31:42,219 --> 01:31:47,750
Ma turned over on her back and crossed her
hands under her head.

1475
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:51,369
She yawned and then closed her eyes.

1476
01:31:51,369 --> 01:32:00,639
In her half-sleep, she heard footsteps approaching,
but it was a man's voice that awoke her.

1477
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,710
"Who's in here?"

1478
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:04,159
Ma sat up quickly.

1479
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:08,070
A brown-faced man bent over and looked in.

1480
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:13,599
He wore boots and a big silver star was pinned
to his shirt at the left breast.

1481
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:18,139
"Who's in here?" he demanded again.

1482
01:32:18,139 --> 01:32:19,519
Ma asked, "What do you want, mister?"

1483
01:32:19,519 --> 01:32:22,050
"What do you think I want?

1484
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,440
I want to know who's in here."

1485
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,480
"There's just the three of us in here.

1486
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,119
Me and Grandma and my girl."

1487
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:33,719
"Where are your men?"

1488
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:35,679
"They went down to clean up.

1489
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,560
We were driving all night."

1490
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,159
"Where'd you come from?"

1491
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:41,159
"Oklahoma."

1492
01:32:41,159 --> 01:32:43,289
"Well, you can't stay here."

1493
01:32:43,289 --> 01:32:47,530
"We plan to get out tonight and cross the
desert, mister."

1494
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:49,560
"Well, you'd better.

1495
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,599
If you're here tomorrow at this time, I'll
throw you in jail.

1496
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:57,440
We don't want any of you settling down here."

1497
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,150
Ma's face was red with anger.

1498
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:04,230
"Mister, where I come from you keep your voice
down.

1499
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:06,400
Frightening women."

1500
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,849
She came toward him with a cooking pan in
her hand.

1501
01:33:09,849 --> 01:33:10,849
"Go on.

1502
01:33:10,849 --> 01:33:13,469
I'm glad our men aren't here.

1503
01:33:13,469 --> 01:33:14,469
They'd pull you to pieces."

1504
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:18,380
The man took two steps backward.

1505
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:21,530
"Well, you ain't in your country now.

1506
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:27,010
You're in California, and we don't want you
Oakies settling down."

1507
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:28,329
"Oakies?"

1508
01:33:28,329 --> 01:33:29,329
Ma said softly.

1509
01:33:29,329 --> 01:33:30,329
"Yeah, Oakies!

1510
01:33:30,329 --> 01:33:34,679
And if you're here when I come tomorrow, I'll
put you in jail."

1511
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:42,440
He turned and walked to the next tent and
banged on the side with his hand.

1512
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,510
Tom heard his name called.

1513
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:50,139
"Tom, oh Tom."

1514
01:33:50,139 --> 01:33:52,840
He sat up and whistled through his teeth.

1515
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,250
The bushes shook and Ruthie stood looking
at him.

1516
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:59,010
"Ma wants you," she said.

1517
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:01,360
"Ma wants you right away."

1518
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:05,400
"All right," he said as he stood up.

1519
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:12,199
Ruthie ran, and Tom heard her call excitedly
for Winfield as she went.

1520
01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:16,389
Ma had started a fire and had a pan of water
heating.

1521
01:34:16,389 --> 01:34:18,570
She looked happy when she saw him.

1522
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:21,610
"What's the matter, Ma?" he asked.

1523
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:24,329
"I was scared," she said.

1524
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:25,941
"There was a policeman here.

1525
01:34:25,941 --> 01:34:28,789
He says we can't stay here.

1526
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:31,969
I was scared you'd hit him if he talked to
you."

1527
01:34:31,969 --> 01:34:34,679
"Why would I hit him?"

1528
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:35,679
Ma smiled.

1529
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:42,010
"Well, he talked so bad - I nearly hit him
myself."

1530
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:44,050
Tom took her arm and he laughed.

1531
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:47,400
He sat down on the ground, still laughing.

1532
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:48,979
"My God, Ma.

1533
01:34:48,979 --> 01:34:52,130
I knew you when you were gentle.

1534
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:54,349
What's happened to you?"

1535
01:34:54,349 --> 01:34:55,519
She looked serious.

1536
01:34:55,519 --> 01:34:58,130
"I don't know, Tom."

1537
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,599
"First you frighten us with that hammer, and
now you try to hit a cop."

1538
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:08,250
He laughed softly, "Tom."

1539
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,670
"Yeah."

1540
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:12,020
She waited a long time.

1541
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:18,479
"Tom, that policeman - he called us Oakies.

1542
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,020
And he said that we can't stay here."

1543
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,679
"Did he say why?"

1544
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:26,460
"He said that we ain't at home now.

1545
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:29,510
We're in California."

1546
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:36,260
Tom said slowly, "Ma, I have something to
tell you.

1547
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:40,030
Noah - he went on down the river.

1548
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:42,890
He ain't going on."

1549
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:47,719
It took a moment for Ma to understand.

1550
01:35:47,719 --> 01:35:49,630
"Why?"

1551
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:51,130
she asked softly.

1552
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:53,760
"I don't know.

1553
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,499
He said that he has to."

1554
01:35:55,499 --> 01:35:58,090
"How will he eat?"

1555
01:35:58,090 --> 01:36:00,210
"I don't know.

1556
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:03,369
He said he'll catch fish."

1557
01:36:03,369 --> 01:36:06,449
Ma was silent for a long time.

1558
01:36:06,449 --> 01:36:11,249
"The family's falling apart," she said.

1559
01:36:11,249 --> 01:36:13,829
"I don't know.

1560
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:15,770
Seems like I can't think.

1561
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:19,260
I just can't think.

1562
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:23,280
There's too much happening."

1563
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:27,099
Tom said, "He'll be all right, Ma.

1564
01:36:27,099 --> 01:36:28,099
He's a funny kind of guy."

1565
01:36:28,099 --> 01:36:33,280
The other men came up from the river.

1566
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,400
Their eyes were full of sleep.

1567
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,570
Pa said, "What's the matter?"

1568
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:40,650
"We're going," said Tom.

1569
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:43,420
"A cop said we have to go.

1570
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:45,499
We can get a good start.

1571
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:48,210
It's nearly three hundred miles where we're
going."

1572
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,280
Pa said, "I thought we were going to rest."

1573
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,020
"Well, we ain't.

1574
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:57,130
We have to go, Pa," Tom said.

1575
01:36:57,130 --> 01:37:00,610
"Noah ain't going.

1576
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,940
He walked on down the river."

1577
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,739
"Ain't going?

1578
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:06,330
What's the matter with him?"

1579
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:10,420
"Well, we have to go," said Tom.

1580
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,860
Wilson walked near for the last words.

1581
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:17,630
"We can't go, folks," he said.

1582
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:19,880
"Sairy can't go.

1583
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,110
If they jail us, well, they jail us.

1584
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:26,389
She's got to rest and get strong."

1585
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:30,580
Pa said, "Maybe we can wait and go together."

1586
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:32,260
"No," Wilson said.

1587
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:35,679
"You've been nice to us, but you can't stay
here.

1588
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,020
You have to get on and get jobs.

1589
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:41,750
We ain't going to let you stay."

1590
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:46,530
Pa said excitedly, "But you ain't got anything."

1591
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:50,320
Wilson smiled and said, "We never had anything.

1592
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:55,389
Now you go, or I'll get mean and mad."

1593
01:37:55,389 --> 01:38:02,729
The men started loading up the truck, Uncle
John on top, while the others passed things

1594
01:38:02,729 --> 01:38:03,729
up to him.

1595
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:10,429
Tom said, "With the load we're taking, this
old wagon will boil her head off.

1596
01:38:10,429 --> 01:38:13,570
We have to have plenty of water."

1597
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:16,420
Ma passed the boiled potatoes out.

1598
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:23,000
The family ate standing, throwing the hot
potatoes from hand to hand until they cooled.

1599
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,619
Then, the men went into the tent.

1600
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:30,860
Grandma was still asleep, her mouth wide open.

1601
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:36,890
They lifted the whole bed and gently passed
it up to the top of the truck.

1602
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:41,449
Grandma moved her head, but she did not wake.

1603
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:47,929
Ma went into the Wilsons' tent for about ten
minutes and came out quietly.

1604
01:38:47,929 --> 01:38:52,280
"It's time to go," she said.

1605
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:57,449
The family climbed on the truck, Ma on top,
beside Grandma.

1606
01:38:57,449 --> 01:39:03,390
Tom and Al and Pa sat in the seat, and Winfield
on Pa's knees.

1607
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:07,590
Connie and Rosasharn made a nest against the
front.

1608
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:13,400
The preacher, Uncle John, and Ruthie were
close together on the load.

1609
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,290
Pa called, "Goodbye."

1610
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:20,940
There was no answer from the Wilsons' tent.

1611
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:26,960
Tom started the engine and the truck slowly
moved away.

1612
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,250
Tom drove into a gas station and checked the
tires for air.

1613
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:36,849
He had the truck filled with gas and bought
two five-gallon cans of gas and a two-gallon

1614
01:39:36,849 --> 01:39:38,329
can of oil.

1615
01:39:38,329 --> 01:39:39,462
He looked at a map.

1616
01:39:39,462 --> 01:39:46,729
The gas station boy in his white uniform seemed
anxious until the bill was paid.

1617
01:39:46,729 --> 01:39:49,400
"You people sure have courage.

1618
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,570
Crossing in this old truck."

1619
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:59,210
The truck was back on the road and moved on
over the hot earth, and the hours passed.

1620
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:02,119
Ruthie and Winfield went to sleep.

1621
01:40:02,119 --> 01:40:09,289
Connie loosened a blanket from the load and
covered himself and Rosasharn with it.

1622
01:40:09,289 --> 01:40:15,420
On the back of the truck Ma lay on the bed
beside Grandma and she could not see with

1623
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:21,690
her eyes but she could feel the struggling
body and the struggling heart.

1624
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:24,269
And Ma said, "All right.

1625
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:28,440
It's going to be all right.

1626
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,510
You know the family has to get across.

1627
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:35,519
You know that."

1628
01:40:35,519 --> 01:40:42,800
It was near midnight when they came to the
next inspection station.

1629
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:49,530
A guard came out from an office and wrote
down the license number and looked around.

1630
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:53,019
Tom asked, "What's this about?"

1631
01:40:53,019 --> 01:40:54,019
"Inspection.

1632
01:40:54,019 --> 01:40:55,690
We have to look over your stuff.

1633
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:59,420
Do you have any vegetables or seeds?"

1634
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,940
"No," said Tom.

1635
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,300
"Well, we have to look over your stuff.

1636
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,960
You have to unload."

1637
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,070
Ma climbed down from the truck.

1638
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:09,230
"Look, mister.

1639
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:12,460
We have a sick old lady.

1640
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,480
We have to get her to a doctor.

1641
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,530
We can't wait.

1642
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:18,239
You can't make us wait."

1643
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,239
"Yeah?

1644
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:20,840
Well, we have to look you over."

1645
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:25,599
"I swear we ain't got anything," Ma cried.

1646
01:41:25,599 --> 01:41:26,949
"I swear.

1647
01:41:26,949 --> 01:41:30,110
And Grandma's really sick."

1648
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:33,190
Ma pulled herself up to the back of the truck.

1649
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:34,909
"Look," she said.

1650
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:40,070
The guard shot a flashlight up on the old
thin face.

1651
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:44,479
"By God, she is," he said.

1652
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:50,440
"Do you swear you don't have any seeds or
fruits or vegetables, no corn, no oranges?"

1653
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,639
"No, no.

1654
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:52,639
We don't!"

1655
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:53,780
"Then go ahead.

1656
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:57,090
You can get a doctor in Barstow.

1657
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,780
That's only eight miles.

1658
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,570
Go on ahead."

1659
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:04,360
Tom climbed in and drove on.

1660
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:11,920
He increased the speed, and in the little
town of Barstow he stopped, got out, and walked

1661
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,749
around to the back of the truck.

1662
01:42:14,749 --> 01:42:18,510
Ma leaned out, "It's all right.

1663
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,670
Let's not stop here.

1664
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:20,989
We need to get across."

1665
01:42:20,989 --> 01:42:23,290
"But how's Grandma?"

1666
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:25,460
"She's all right.

1667
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:26,460
Drive on.

1668
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,650
We have to get across."

1669
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:32,530
They drove through the night.

1670
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:40,639
In the morning light, the sun came up behind
them, and then - suddenly, they saw the great

1671
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:43,469
valley below them.

1672
01:42:43,469 --> 01:42:47,530
Al stepped on the brake and stopped in the
middle of the road.

1673
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,730
"Wow!

1674
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:51,659
Look!" he said.

1675
01:42:51,659 --> 01:43:00,150
The rows of fruit trees, the great flat valley,
green and beautiful, and the farmhouses.

1676
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:04,610
Pa said, "God!"

1677
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:07,270
Al drove to the side of the road and parked.

1678
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:11,340
"I just want to look at it."

1679
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:14,199
The grain fields golden in the morning.

1680
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:19,159
Pa said, "I never knew there was anything
like this."

1681
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:23,369
The peach trees and the dark green areas of
oranges.

1682
01:43:23,369 --> 01:43:28,039
And the red roofs of barns among the trees.

1683
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:29,119
Al got out.

1684
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,369
He called, "Ma - come look.

1685
01:43:32,369 --> 01:43:33,909
We're there!"

1686
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:39,650
Ruthie and Winfield hurried down from the
car, and then they stood, silent before the

1687
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:41,340
great valley.

1688
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,559
Ruthie whispered, "It's California."

1689
01:43:46,559 --> 01:43:50,239
Winfield said, "There's fruit."

1690
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:55,380
Casy and Uncle John, Connie and Rosasharn
climbed down.

1691
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:59,249
And they stood silently.

1692
01:43:59,249 --> 01:44:02,059
Tom said, "Where's Ma?

1693
01:44:02,059 --> 01:44:04,340
I want Ma to see it.

1694
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:10,639
Look, Ma!" Ma was climbing out slowly and
stiffly.

1695
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:12,969
Tom looked at her.

1696
01:44:12,969 --> 01:44:14,789
"Ma, are you sick?"

1697
01:44:14,789 --> 01:44:17,030
Her voice was weak.

1698
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:20,800
"Did you say we crossed?"

1699
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,699
Tom pointed to the great valley "Look!"

1700
01:44:24,699 --> 01:44:28,269
She turned her head and her mouth opened a
little.

1701
01:44:28,269 --> 01:44:30,580
"Thank God!"

1702
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:31,580
she said.

1703
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:34,179
"The family's here."

1704
01:44:34,179 --> 01:44:37,349
"Are you sick, Ma?"

1705
01:44:37,349 --> 01:44:39,570
"No, just tired."

1706
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:42,849
"Didn't you get any sleep?"

1707
01:44:42,849 --> 01:44:43,969
"No."

1708
01:44:43,969 --> 01:44:47,270
"Was Grandma bad?"

1709
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:52,440
Ma raised her eyes and looked over the valley.

1710
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:57,090
"Grandma's dead."

1711
01:44:57,090 --> 01:45:04,059
They looked at her, all of them, and Pa asked,
"When?"

1712
01:45:04,059 --> 01:45:07,210
"Before they stopped us last night."

1713
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:10,309
"So that's why you didn't want them to look."

1714
01:45:10,309 --> 01:45:15,369
"I was afraid we wouldn't get across," she
said.

1715
01:45:15,369 --> 01:45:19,020
"I told Grandma that we couldn't help her.

1716
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,679
The family had to get across.

1717
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:23,810
I told her."

1718
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:27,110
Tom said, "Wow.

1719
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:30,889
You were lying there with her all night long!"

1720
01:45:30,889 --> 01:45:33,969
"The family had to get across."

1721
01:45:33,969 --> 01:45:38,150
"We have to go now," Pa said.

1722
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:41,730
"We have to go on down."

1723
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:45,900
Al climbed on the load to make room for Ma
in the seat.

1724
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,730
He sat down beside Casy and Uncle John.

1725
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:52,840
"Well, she was old."

1726
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:57,260
Tom and Ma and Pa got into the front seat.

1727
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:02,930
The sun was behind them and the valley, gold
and green, was in front of them.

1728
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:06,309
Ma said, "It's pretty.

1729
01:46:06,309 --> 01:46:11,300
It's a pity that Grandpa and Grandma ain't
here to see this."

1730
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,030
"Yeah, it's a pity," Pa said.

1731
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:20,630
And the truck rolled down the mountain into
the great valley.

1732
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:23,300
CHAPTER SIX

1733
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,639
Hoovervilles

1734
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:33,179
In Kansas and Arkansas, in Oklahoma and Texas
and New Mexico, the tractors moved in and

1735
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:36,159
pushed the tenants out.

1736
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:41,249
Three hundred thousand in California and more
coming.

1737
01:46:41,249 --> 01:46:45,679
And in California there was a Hooverville
on the edge of every town.

1738
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:53,440
The tiny town lay close to the water and the
houses were tents and large boxes, a great

1739
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,780
trash pile.

1740
01:46:56,780 --> 01:47:02,880
The family, on top of the load, the children
and Connie and Rosasharn and the preacher,

1741
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,440
were stiff and uncomfortable.

1742
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:12,519
They had sat in the heat in front of the coroner's
office in Bakersfield while Pa and Ma and

1743
01:47:12,519 --> 01:47:15,400
Uncle John went in.

1744
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:19,820
Al and Tom walked along the street and looked
into the store windows.

1745
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:26,449
Then a basket was brought out and Grandma
was lifted down from the truck.

1746
01:47:26,449 --> 01:47:32,699
At last Pa and Ma and Uncle John came out,
and they were quiet.

1747
01:47:32,699 --> 01:47:38,119
Pa looked at Ma and said, "There wasn't anything
else we could do.

1748
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:40,539
We didn't have enough money."

1749
01:47:40,539 --> 01:47:43,420
"I know," Ma said.

1750
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:47,479
"But she always wanted a nice funeral."

1751
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:49,380
"Where are we going?"

1752
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,469
Tom asked.

1753
01:47:50,469 --> 01:47:54,239
Pa raised his hat and scratched his head.

1754
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,219
"Camp," he said.

1755
01:47:56,219 --> 01:48:00,639
"We ain't going to spend our last few dollars
until we get work.

1756
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,070
Drive out in the country."

1757
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:09,869
Tom started the car and they rolled through
the streets and out toward the country.

1758
01:48:09,869 --> 01:48:14,889
And by a bridge they saw a group of tents
and large boxes.

1759
01:48:14,889 --> 01:48:18,139
Tom said, "Why don't we stop here?

1760
01:48:18,139 --> 01:48:20,210
We can find out where work is."

1761
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:23,889
He drove down to the edge of the camp.

1762
01:48:23,889 --> 01:48:27,599
There was no order in the camp.

1763
01:48:27,599 --> 01:48:31,960
Little gray tents, houses made of boxes and
rusted metal.

1764
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:38,349
A group of boxes lay about, boxes to sit on,
to eat on.

1765
01:48:38,349 --> 01:48:40,969
Tom stopped the truck and looked at Pa.

1766
01:48:40,969 --> 01:48:43,770
"It ain't pretty," he said.

1767
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:47,289
"Do you want to go someplace else?"

1768
01:48:47,289 --> 01:48:51,590
Pa said, "We have to ask about work."

1769
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:57,869
Tom opened the door and stepped out, as the
family climbed down from the load and looked

1770
01:48:57,869 --> 01:48:59,800
curiously at the camp.

1771
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,320
A young man was working on an old car.

1772
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,659
He looked over at the Joad's truck.

1773
01:49:05,659 --> 01:49:08,929
Pa said, "Could we camp here?"

1774
01:49:08,929 --> 01:49:11,239
"Sure, why not.

1775
01:49:11,239 --> 01:49:14,310
Have you folks just come across?"

1776
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,679
"Yeah," said Tom.

1777
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,760
"We just got in this morning."

1778
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,790
"Have you never been in Hooverville before?"

1779
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:22,150
"Where's Hooverville?"

1780
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:24,179
"This is it."

1781
01:49:24,179 --> 01:49:26,219
"Oh!" said Tom.

1782
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:29,150
"We just got in."

1783
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:32,139
Ma said, "Let's get the camp up.

1784
01:49:32,139 --> 01:49:33,760
I'm tired.

1785
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,080
Maybe we can all rest."

1786
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:42,010
Pa and Uncle John climbed up on the truck
to unload the tent and the bed.

1787
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:47,039
The young man said to Tom, "But you can't
stay too long.

1788
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,869
If you just stay in one camp, you'll see how
quick a sheriff will push you along."

1789
01:49:51,869 --> 01:49:53,639
"But what for?"

1790
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:55,550
"I don't know.

1791
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:58,550
Some people say that they don't want us to
vote.

1792
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:01,190
Keep us moving so we can't vote.

1793
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:05,449
And some say that if we settled in one place,
we'd get organized."

1794
01:50:05,449 --> 01:50:09,230
"We're looking for work," Tom told him.

1795
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:11,719
"We'll take any kind of work.

1796
01:50:11,719 --> 01:50:16,639
Back home some fellows came through with handbills
- orange ones.

1797
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:21,469
It said they need lots of people out here
to work the crops."

1798
01:50:21,469 --> 01:50:22,920
The young man laughed.

1799
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:29,289
"They say that there are three hundred thousand
of us here, and I bet every family has seen

1800
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,690
those handbills."

1801
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,570
"But there is work," Tom said.

1802
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:39,050
"With all of the stuff that's growing around
here - vegetables, grapes - I've seen it.

1803
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:41,719
They have to have men."

1804
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:49,170
A baby cried from inside a tent, and the young
man walked away, shaking his head.

1805
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:56,079
Inside the Joad tent, Connie and Rosasharn
were talking quietly.

1806
01:50:56,079 --> 01:50:57,840
Connie's eyes were watery.

1807
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,489
"If I'd known that it was going to be like
this, I wouldn't have come.

1808
01:51:03,489 --> 01:51:08,809
I would have studied nights about tractors
back home and got a three-dollar job.

1809
01:51:08,809 --> 01:51:16,010
A fellow can live well on three dollars a
day, and go to the picture show every night,

1810
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,010
too."

1811
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:18,010
Rosasharn looked worried.

1812
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:21,979
"You're going to study nights about radios,"
she said.

1813
01:51:21,979 --> 01:51:23,810
He was silent.

1814
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,229
"Ain't you?"

1815
01:51:25,229 --> 01:51:26,229
she demanded.

1816
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:27,229
"Yeah, sure.

1817
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:30,239
As soon as I get a little money."

1818
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,590
She rolled up on her elbow.

1819
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:34,719
"You ain't giving it up!"

1820
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:37,659
"No, no - of course not.

1821
01:51:37,659 --> 01:51:43,570
But - I didn't know there were places like
this that we'd have to live in."

1822
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:45,530
The girl's eyes hardened.

1823
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:50,179
"You have to," she said.

1824
01:51:50,179 --> 01:51:56,280
Ma knelt beside the fire, breaking sticks
to keep the flames up under the pot of soup.

1825
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:01,249
The children of the camp, fifteen of them,
stood and watched.

1826
01:52:01,249 --> 01:52:04,289
"How long have you been in California?"

1827
01:52:04,289 --> 01:52:06,250
Ma asked an older girl.

1828
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:08,929
"Oh, about six months.

1829
01:52:08,929 --> 01:52:14,430
We lived in a government camp for a short
time, and then we went north, and when we

1830
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:16,090
came back it was full.

1831
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:18,499
That was a nice place to live."

1832
01:52:18,499 --> 01:52:19,959
"Where's that?"

1833
01:52:19,959 --> 01:52:21,420
Ma asked.

1834
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,619
"Over by Weedpatch.

1835
01:52:23,619 --> 01:52:29,150
Got nice toilets and bathtubs, and you can
wash clothes in a tub, and at night the folks

1836
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:33,690
play music and on Saturday nights they have
a dance."

1837
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:36,889
Ma said, "I'd like to go there."

1838
01:52:36,889 --> 01:52:42,050
Al had walked along to where the young man
was working on his car.

1839
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:45,829
"Can I help you with that?" he asked.

1840
01:52:45,829 --> 01:52:50,199
"Well, yeah, I could use some help," the young
man said.

1841
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:52,369
"My name's Floyd Knowles."

1842
01:52:52,369 --> 01:52:55,659
"I'm Al Joad."

1843
01:52:55,659 --> 01:52:57,350
He took out his pocket knife.

1844
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:04,170
"There isn't anything I love more than the
inside of an engine."

1845
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:08,500
Floyd then said, "You know, I've been here
for six months.

1846
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,449
Going all over this state, trying to find
work."

1847
01:53:11,449 --> 01:53:13,949
"Ain't there any work?"

1848
01:53:13,949 --> 01:53:15,150
Al asked.

1849
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:17,719
"No, there ain't any steady work."

1850
01:53:17,719 --> 01:53:23,889
The two young men continued to work and talk
about jobs.

1851
01:53:23,889 --> 01:53:25,519
"Al!"

1852
01:53:25,519 --> 01:53:27,320
Winfield called out.

1853
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:30,050
"Al, dinner's ready."

1854
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,349
Al wiped his hands on his pants.

1855
01:53:32,349 --> 01:53:35,599
"We ain't eaten today," he said to Floyd.

1856
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,980
"I'll come back and help after I've eaten."

1857
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:45,119
Ma mixed the soup more and put some in bowls
for the family.

1858
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:49,100
After dinner, Al said to Tom, "Come with me."

1859
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,739
They walked away together.

1860
01:53:50,739 --> 01:53:52,960
"What's the matter with you?"

1861
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,280
Tom asked.

1862
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:55,600
"Just wait."

1863
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:58,369
He led Tom to the broken car.

1864
01:53:58,369 --> 01:54:01,280
"This is Floyd Knowles," he said.

1865
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,300
"Yeah, I talked to him before.

1866
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,449
How are you?"

1867
01:54:04,449 --> 01:54:08,400
"Just getting this old thing repaired," Floyd
said.

1868
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,530
"Floyd just told me.

1869
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:12,829
Tell him, Floyd."

1870
01:54:12,829 --> 01:54:17,880
Floyd said, "A fellow came through and he
said there's going to be work up north."

1871
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,760
"Up north?"

1872
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,760
"Yeah."

1873
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,110
"What kind of work?"

1874
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:24,559
"Picking fruit.

1875
01:54:24,559 --> 01:54:25,559
It's near ready."

1876
01:54:25,559 --> 01:54:27,409
"How far?"

1877
01:54:27,409 --> 01:54:28,780
Tom demanded.

1878
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:31,469
"Oh, about two hundred miles."

1879
01:54:31,469 --> 01:54:34,320
"That's a long way," Tom said.

1880
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,079
"How do we know there's going to be work when
we get there?"

1881
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:40,989
"Well, we don't know," said Floyd.

1882
01:54:40,989 --> 01:54:43,940
"But there ain't anything here.

1883
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:46,579
This fellow got a letter from his brother
about it.

1884
01:54:46,579 --> 01:54:50,230
And he said don't tell anybody, or there'll
be too many.

1885
01:54:50,230 --> 01:54:53,460
We need to get out at night."

1886
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:56,590
Tom said, "Well, I don't know.

1887
01:54:56,590 --> 01:54:58,809
It's just a long way.

1888
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:04,440
And we hoped we could get work here and rent
a house to live in."

1889
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:08,969
Floyd said patiently, "I know you just got
here.

1890
01:55:08,969 --> 01:55:11,010
There's stuff you have to learn.

1891
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:17,780
You ain't going to settle down because there
ain't work to settle you."

1892
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:24,719
A bright new car turned off the highway and
headed down into the camp.

1893
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:27,329
It pulled into the center of the camp.

1894
01:55:27,329 --> 01:55:28,869
"Who's this?"

1895
01:55:28,869 --> 01:55:29,900
Tom asked Floyd.

1896
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:33,090
"I don't know - cops maybe."

1897
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:38,460
The car door opened and a man got out and
stood beside the car.

1898
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:42,119
Inside the car another man remained seated.

1899
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:45,769
The first man said, "Do you men want to work?

1900
01:55:45,769 --> 01:55:47,460
A place called Tulare.

1901
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:48,539
Fruit's ready.

1902
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:52,170
We need a lot of pickers."

1903
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:56,099
Floyd spoke up, "Are you doing the hiring?"

1904
01:55:56,099 --> 01:55:58,699
"Well, I'm contracting the land."

1905
01:55:58,699 --> 01:56:03,969
The men of the camp all grouped around now.

1906
01:56:03,969 --> 01:56:07,340
One of the men asked, "What are you paying?"

1907
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:10,159
"Well, I don't know exactly.

1908
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:11,260
About thirty cents."

1909
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:12,800
"Why don't you know?"

1910
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,030
"Well, it depends on the price of fruit."

1911
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:19,119
Floyd stepped ahead.

1912
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:21,690
He said quietly, "I'll go, mister.

1913
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:28,070
You just need to give us a written order for
work, showing us where and how much and we'll

1914
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:29,840
sign it."

1915
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:34,809
The contractor said angrily, "Are you telling
me how to do my job?"

1916
01:56:34,809 --> 01:56:38,579
He turned to the new car and said, "Joe!"

1917
01:56:38,579 --> 01:56:41,030
The man in the car stepped out.

1918
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:47,409
He was wearing tall boots and a brown uniform
and a sheriff's star on his shirt.

1919
01:56:47,409 --> 01:56:49,030
"What do you want?"

1920
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:51,860
"Have you ever seen this man, Joe?"

1921
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:54,469
The contractor asked, pointing to Floyd.

1922
01:56:54,469 --> 01:56:56,030
"What did he do?"

1923
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:58,420
"He was talking and causing trouble."

1924
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:01,340
"Hmm."

1925
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:04,380
The sheriff moved around Floyd slowly.

1926
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,940
"You see!"

1927
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:06,940
Floyd cried.

1928
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:09,840
"If this guy was honest, he wouldn't need
a cop with him."

1929
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:15,150
"Yeah, maybe I have seen him before," the
sheriff said.

1930
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:20,800
"He looks like one of the guys wanted for
stealing a car just last week."

1931
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,400
He shouted at Floyd, "Get in the car!"

1932
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:27,550
"You have nothing against him," Tom said.

1933
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:32,320
The sheriff said to Tom, "If I were you, I'd
keep my mouth shut."

1934
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,989
The contractor turned back to the men.

1935
01:57:35,989 --> 01:57:40,489
"Don't listen to these troublemakers - they'll
get you in trouble.

1936
01:57:40,489 --> 01:57:43,079
I can use all of you in Tulare."

1937
01:57:43,079 --> 01:57:47,199
The men did not answer.

1938
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:49,110
The sheriff turned back to them.

1939
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:51,449
"Maybe we should go," he said.

1940
01:57:51,449 --> 01:57:54,130
He had a thin smile on his face.

1941
01:57:54,130 --> 01:57:58,590
"The Health Department says that we have to
clean out this camp.

1942
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:00,300
You fellows should go to Tulare.

1943
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:05,159
That's just a friendly way of telling you.

1944
01:58:05,159 --> 01:58:08,479
A bunch of men might be here later.

1945
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:12,010
Someone might get hurt if you ain't gone."

1946
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:15,050
"That's all," the contractor said.

1947
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:18,119
"Men needed in Tulare."

1948
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:19,289
"Yeah, that's all.

1949
01:58:19,289 --> 01:58:22,500
I don't want to see you here tomorrow morning."

1950
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,539
The sheriff then looked at Floyd.

1951
01:58:25,539 --> 01:58:28,900
"Now you get in that car."

1952
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:34,300
Floyd looked at Tom, then he swung around
and hit the sheriff hard in the face, and

1953
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:37,250
then he was away, running past the tents.

1954
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:43,840
The sheriff started to fall back but then
moved forward and Tom put out his foot.

1955
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:47,540
The sheriff fell over it and rolled, reaching
for his gun.

1956
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:49,670
But Floyd was out of sight.

1957
01:58:49,670 --> 01:58:52,510
The sheriff fired from the ground.

1958
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:56,809
A woman screamed and then looked at her bloody
hand.

1959
01:58:56,809 --> 01:58:58,710
The sheriff raised his gun again.

1960
01:58:58,710 --> 01:59:04,769
The men in the group gathered around him and
Casy stepped up and kicked him in the neck.

1961
01:59:04,769 --> 01:59:08,550
The sheriff became unconscious.

1962
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:13,000
The motor of the new car sounded loudly as
the car drove off.

1963
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,289
A crowd gathered around the woman with the
broken hand.

1964
01:59:17,289 --> 01:59:19,579
Casy moved close to Tom.

1965
01:59:19,579 --> 01:59:22,170
"You have to get out," he said.

1966
01:59:22,170 --> 01:59:25,150
"Go down by the river and hide.

1967
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:27,409
He saw you put your foot out."

1968
01:59:27,409 --> 01:59:30,260
"I don't want to go," said Tom.

1969
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:33,630
Casy whispered, "They'll fingerprint you.

1970
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:34,860
You broke parole.

1971
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,980
They'll send you back."

1972
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:37,980
"Oh!

1973
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:38,980
I forgot!"

1974
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:41,349
"Go quick," Casy said.

1975
01:59:41,349 --> 01:59:45,040
"Before he gets up."

1976
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,040
Then he turned to Al.

1977
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,040
"Get out," he said.

1978
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,709
"Go on, get out - to the tent.

1979
01:59:49,709 --> 01:59:53,219
You don't know anything."

1980
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:54,219
"Yeah?

1981
01:59:54,219 --> 01:59:56,739
How about you?"

1982
01:59:56,739 --> 01:59:58,749
Casy smiled at him.

1983
01:59:58,749 --> 02:00:00,710
"Somebody has to take the blame.

1984
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:08,119
And your ma and pa will get in trouble and
they'll send Tom back to McAlester."

1985
02:00:08,119 --> 02:00:10,329
Al considered it for a moment.

1986
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:12,329
"OK," he said.

1987
02:00:12,329 --> 02:00:15,630
"I think you're a fool, though."

1988
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:21,519
Tires screamed on the highway and an open
car came quickly into the camp.

1989
02:00:21,519 --> 02:00:23,999
Four men with guns got out.

1990
02:00:23,999 --> 02:00:26,139
Casy walked to them.

1991
02:00:26,139 --> 02:00:28,060
"What's going on here?"

1992
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:33,340
Casy said, "I knocked out your man there."

1993
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:36,260
One of the men with guns went to the sheriff.

1994
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:37,800
He was conscious.

1995
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:40,209
"What happened here?"

1996
02:00:40,209 --> 02:00:44,969
"Well," said Casy, "he got mean, so I hit
him.

1997
02:00:44,969 --> 02:00:48,330
And then he started shooting - hit a woman
over there.

1998
02:00:48,330 --> 02:00:49,889
So I hit him again."

1999
02:00:49,889 --> 02:00:53,620
"What did you do in the first place?"

2000
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:55,709
"I talked back," said Casy.

2001
02:00:55,709 --> 02:00:58,500
"Get in the car."

2002
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,219
The sheriff was up.

2003
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:01,650
He looked at Casy.

2004
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:04,070
"It doesn't look like him."

2005
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:06,499
"It was me," Casy said.

2006
02:01:06,499 --> 02:01:11,640
"You got smart with the wrong fellow."

2007
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:16,969
When the police had gone, the people came
out of the tents.

2008
02:01:16,969 --> 02:01:22,840
The sun was down now and a gentle blue evening
light was in the camp.

2009
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:30,199
The women went back to the fires and the men
came together to talk softly.

2010
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:32,860
Rosasharn moved weakly out of the tent.

2011
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:34,420
"Where's Connie?"

2012
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:35,469
she asked angrily.

2013
02:01:35,469 --> 02:01:38,300
"I ain't seen Connie for a long time.

2014
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:40,780
Where did he go?"

2015
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:43,610
"I ain't seen him," Ma said.

2016
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:47,989
The tears started again in Rosasharn's eyes.

2017
02:01:47,989 --> 02:01:50,280
She went back toward the tent.

2018
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:54,729
The girl knelt down and started preparing
the potatoes.

2019
02:01:54,729 --> 02:01:57,969
She said, "Wait until I see him.

2020
02:01:57,969 --> 02:01:59,900
I'll tell him."

2021
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:06,219
Uncle John dug with his thumb into a small
pocket of his blue jeans and took out a dirty

2022
02:02:06,219 --> 02:02:08,190
folded bill.

2023
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:10,929
He spread it out and showed it to Pa.

2024
02:02:10,929 --> 02:02:13,500
"Five dollars," he said.

2025
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,749
"Steal it?"

2026
02:02:14,749 --> 02:02:15,749
Pa asked.

2027
02:02:15,749 --> 02:02:17,360
"No, I had it.

2028
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,120
Kept it to get drunk.

2029
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:24,249
I knew there was going to be a time when I
would have to get drunk.

2030
02:02:24,249 --> 02:02:28,039
The preacher went and gave himself up to save
Tom.

2031
02:02:28,039 --> 02:02:30,670
I just have to get drunk."

2032
02:02:30,670 --> 02:02:36,560
Pa took the dirty bill and gave Uncle John
two dollars.

2033
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,230
"There you are," he said.

2034
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:42,880
"A fellow has to do what he has to do."

2035
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:46,270
Uncle John stood up and walked away.

2036
02:02:46,270 --> 02:02:52,860
Pa and Ma and the children watched him walk
up to the highway and across the road to the

2037
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:54,969
grocery store.

2038
02:02:54,969 --> 02:03:00,869
Ruthie whispered to Winfield, "I'm going to
get drunk."

2039
02:03:00,869 --> 02:03:04,860
She swung around and crossed her eyes and
let her tongue hang out.

2040
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:06,900
"Look at me.

2041
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,269
I'm drunk."

2042
02:03:08,269 --> 02:03:09,929
"Look," Winfield cried.

2043
02:03:09,929 --> 02:03:12,239
"I'm Uncle John."

2044
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:17,210
He spun around and then fell to the ground.

2045
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:23,650
Al and Tom walked quietly toward the camp,
and they saw the children walking strangely.

2046
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:28,460
Tom stopped and said, "Are you two crazy?"

2047
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:30,650
The children stopped - embarrassed.

2048
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:34,619
"We were just playing," Ruthie said.

2049
02:03:34,619 --> 02:03:38,780
"It's a crazy way to play," Tom said.

2050
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:42,380
Ruthie said, "It ain't any crazier than a
lot of things."

2051
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:47,380
Tom and Al continued to walk quietly.

2052
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:50,619
Tom said, "Why did Casy do that?

2053
02:03:50,619 --> 02:03:54,949
He'd been talking about how he hadn't done
anything for us.

2054
02:03:54,949 --> 02:03:57,000
He's a funny fellow, Al.

2055
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,709
Thinking all the time."

2056
02:03:58,709 --> 02:04:01,679
They walked past the tents.

2057
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:04,309
Floyd popped his head out of his tent.

2058
02:04:04,309 --> 02:04:06,689
"Are you getting out?"

2059
02:04:06,689 --> 02:04:08,440
Tom said, "I don't know.

2060
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:10,959
Do you think we should?"

2061
02:04:10,959 --> 02:04:11,959
Floyd laughed.

2062
02:04:11,959 --> 02:04:14,310
"They'll burn you out if you don't.

2063
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:16,659
One of their men took a beating tonight.

2064
02:04:16,659 --> 02:04:19,650
Yeah, they'll burn us out."

2065
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:24,309
Al said, "A fellow told me about a government
camp near here.

2066
02:04:24,309 --> 02:04:25,310
Where is it?"

2067
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:27,469
"Oh, I think that's full."

2068
02:04:27,469 --> 02:04:29,809
"Well, where is it?"

2069
02:04:29,809 --> 02:04:37,210
"Go south on highway 99 about fourteen miles,
and turn east to Weedpatch.

2070
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:38,269
But I think it's full."

2071
02:04:38,269 --> 02:04:42,000
"A fellow says it's nice," Al said.

2072
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,650
"We have to move on," Tom said.

2073
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:47,329
"Bye, Floyd."

2074
02:04:47,329 --> 02:04:48,760
"Bye," Floyd said.

2075
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:54,300
"Hope to see you again."

2076
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:58,539
The frying pan of potatoes was cooking over
the fire.

2077
02:04:58,539 --> 02:05:02,179
Ma moved the thick slices around with a spoon.

2078
02:05:02,179 --> 02:05:05,670
Pa and Rosasharn sat near the fire.

2079
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:07,670
"It's Tom!"

2080
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:08,670
Ma cried.

2081
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:09,670
"Thank God."

2082
02:05:09,670 --> 02:05:13,289
"We have to get out of here," said Tom.

2083
02:05:13,289 --> 02:05:15,829
"They're going to burn the camp down tonight."

2084
02:05:15,829 --> 02:05:20,249
Rosasharn demanded, "Have you seen Connie?"

2085
02:05:20,249 --> 02:05:22,199
"Yeah," said Al.

2086
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:24,269
"Going south, up the river."

2087
02:05:24,269 --> 02:05:26,300
"Was he going away?"

2088
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:28,869
"I don't know."

2089
02:05:28,869 --> 02:05:30,810
Ma turned to the girl.

2090
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:35,989
"Rosasharn, you've been talking and acting
strangely.

2091
02:05:35,989 --> 02:05:38,469
What did Connie say to you?"

2092
02:05:38,469 --> 02:05:45,199
Rosasharn said sadly, "He said that he was
sorry he hadn't stayed home and studied about

2093
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:47,360
tractors."

2094
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,380
They were all quiet.

2095
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:53,030
Then Pa said, "Connie wasn't any good.

2096
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:57,070
I saw that a long time ago."

2097
02:05:57,070 --> 02:06:00,449
Rosasharn got up and went into the tent.

2098
02:06:00,449 --> 02:06:03,429
"Sh," Ma said to Pa.

2099
02:06:03,429 --> 02:06:06,590
"Well, he ain't any good," repeated Pa.

2100
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:10,829
"All the time saying what he's going to do,
then doing nothing."

2101
02:06:10,829 --> 02:06:12,619
"Sh!"

2102
02:06:12,619 --> 02:06:14,170
Ma said softly.

2103
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:17,539
Tom interrupted, "Hey.

2104
02:06:17,539 --> 02:06:19,390
We're not sure Connie's gone forever.

2105
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:22,130
We don't have time for talking.

2106
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:26,099
We have to eat and get on our way."

2107
02:06:26,099 --> 02:06:29,550
Ma had been turning the potatoes in the hot
oil.

2108
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:31,650
Now she made her decision.

2109
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:32,909
"Come on!"

2110
02:06:32,909 --> 02:06:33,909
she cried.

2111
02:06:33,909 --> 02:06:34,909
"Let's eat.

2112
02:06:34,909 --> 02:06:37,179
We have to go quick."

2113
02:06:37,179 --> 02:06:39,630
Pa said, "How about John?"

2114
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:42,170
"Where is Uncle John?"

2115
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:43,530
Tom asked.

2116
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:49,380
Pa and Ma were silent for a moment and then
Pa said, "He went to get drunk."

2117
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:51,170
"What?"

2118
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:52,170
Tom said.

2119
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:53,729
"Where did he go?"

2120
02:06:53,729 --> 02:06:57,020
"I don't know," said Pa.

2121
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,210
Tom stood up.

2122
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:02,150
"Look," he said, "you eat and get the stuff
loaded.

2123
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:04,679
I'll go look for Uncle John."

2124
02:07:04,679 --> 02:07:07,030
Tom walked away quickly.

2125
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:10,889
He went across the road to the grocery store.

2126
02:07:10,889 --> 02:07:14,540
When he walked inside, he saw a gray man behind
the counter.

2127
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:17,020
"Good evening," he said.

2128
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:18,979
"Good evening," said the man.

2129
02:07:18,979 --> 02:07:21,499
"Are you looking for something?"

2130
02:07:21,499 --> 02:07:23,829
"My uncle," Tom said.

2131
02:07:23,829 --> 02:07:28,159
The gray man looked puzzled and worried at
the same time.

2132
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:32,449
"Ten times a day someone comes in here looking
for someone."

2133
02:07:32,449 --> 02:07:40,139
"Well, did you see a fellow about sixty years
old, wearing black pants, buying alcohol?"

2134
02:07:40,139 --> 02:07:43,040
"Well, yes I did," said the man.

2135
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:47,829
"I've never seen so much drinking, so I looked
after him.

2136
02:07:47,829 --> 02:07:49,949
He went down to the river.

2137
02:07:49,949 --> 02:07:51,579
Six cans of the strong stuff.

2138
02:07:51,579 --> 02:07:54,429
He won't be far away."

2139
02:07:54,429 --> 02:07:56,869
Tom said, "Thank you, mister.

2140
02:07:56,869 --> 02:08:01,429
Oh, and if you see a young man named Connie,
tell him we went south."

2141
02:08:01,429 --> 02:08:07,310
He went outside and crossed the highway and
walked along the edge of it.

2142
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:11,580
Below him in the sunken field lay the Hooverville.

2143
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:13,590
Tom stopped and listened.

2144
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:18,459
A voice sang out.

2145
02:08:18,459 --> 02:08:27,119
The dull voice sang, "I've given my heart
to Jesus, so Jesus take me home."

2146
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:29,979
Tom followed the voice down to the river.

2147
02:08:29,979 --> 02:08:37,019
He saw Uncle John holding an empty bottle
and moving his body from side to side.

2148
02:08:37,019 --> 02:08:42,130
Tom said quietly, "Hey, Uncle John."

2149
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:43,999
Uncle John turned his head.

2150
02:08:43,999 --> 02:08:45,949
"Who are you?"

2151
02:08:45,949 --> 02:08:48,599
"You forgot me already?"

2152
02:08:48,599 --> 02:08:50,559
"No, Tom.

2153
02:08:50,559 --> 02:08:52,959
Don't try to trick me.

2154
02:08:52,959 --> 02:08:55,320
I'm all alone here."

2155
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:58,570
"Listen to me, Uncle John.

2156
02:08:58,570 --> 02:09:00,360
We're going to move on.

2157
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:04,400
You come along and you can sleep on the load."

2158
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,489
John shook his head.

2159
02:09:05,489 --> 02:09:06,489
"No.

2160
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:07,499
Go on.

2161
02:09:07,499 --> 02:09:09,159
I ain't going.

2162
02:09:09,159 --> 02:09:10,869
I'm going to stay here."

2163
02:09:10,869 --> 02:09:16,010
"Come on now, Uncle John," Tom said.

2164
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:18,630
Uncle John just shook his head.

2165
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:23,610
Tom bent down close to Uncle John and hit
him on the chin.

2166
02:09:23,610 --> 02:09:29,119
Uncle John's head fell back and then forward
with the rest of his body.

2167
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:33,340
Tom stood up and lifted the body over his
shoulders.

2168
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:39,130
When Tom returned to the camp, the truck was
loaded and ready.

2169
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:42,699
Tom and Al pushed Uncle John onto the load.

2170
02:09:42,699 --> 02:09:46,219
"All ready," said Pa.

2171
02:09:46,219 --> 02:09:49,230
Tom asked, "Where's Rosasharn?"

2172
02:09:49,230 --> 02:09:51,949
"Over there," said Ma.

2173
02:09:51,949 --> 02:09:53,750
"Come on, Rosasharn.

2174
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:54,750
We're going now."

2175
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:59,249
The girl sat with her head bent down.

2176
02:09:59,249 --> 02:10:01,789
"I ain't going."

2177
02:10:01,789 --> 02:10:03,650
She did not raise her head.

2178
02:10:03,650 --> 02:10:05,749
"You have to go."

2179
02:10:05,749 --> 02:10:07,849
"I want Connie.

2180
02:10:07,849 --> 02:10:12,320
I ain't going until he comes back."

2181
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:18,289
Three cars pulled out of the camp, up the
road to the highway, old cars loaded with

2182
02:10:18,289 --> 02:10:20,580
tents and people.

2183
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:23,559
Tom said, "Connie will find us.

2184
02:10:23,559 --> 02:10:25,749
I left a message at the store.

2185
02:10:25,749 --> 02:10:27,849
He'll find us."

2186
02:10:27,849 --> 02:10:30,869
Ma said, "Come on, honey"

2187
02:10:30,869 --> 02:10:32,749
"I want to wait."

2188
02:10:32,749 --> 02:10:36,019
"He'll find us," Tom said.

2189
02:10:36,019 --> 02:10:38,139
"Don't worry."

2190
02:10:38,139 --> 02:10:42,840
Rosasharn and Ma walked slowly together to
the truck.

2191
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:46,820
Pa and Al and Tom got into the seat.

2192
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:50,979
When everyone else was on the load, Tom drove
off.

2193
02:10:50,979 --> 02:10:54,599
The truck climbed up to the highway.

2194
02:10:54,599 --> 02:11:00,239
Behind them, a little row of red lights that
looked like flames ran across the highway

2195
02:11:00,239 --> 02:11:01,769
toward the Hooverville.

2196
02:11:01,769 --> 02:11:05,469
Tom stopped the truck at the side of the road.

2197
02:11:05,469 --> 02:11:10,239
He watched the red lights cross the entrance
of the dirt road and continue on.

2198
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:17,090
In a few moments, there came the sounds of
shouts and screams and then flames rose from

2199
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:19,539
the direction of the camp.

2200
02:11:19,539 --> 02:11:24,219
Tom turned on the engine and turned the car
south.

2201
02:11:24,219 --> 02:11:28,699
Ma asked carefully, "Where are we going, Tom?"

2202
02:11:28,699 --> 02:11:33,070
"I'm going to look for that government camp,"
Tom said.

2203
02:11:33,070 --> 02:11:36,099
"A fellow said that they don't have any cops
there."

2204
02:11:36,099 --> 02:11:37,099
CHAPTER SEVEN

2205
02:11:37,099 --> 02:11:38,099
The Government Camp

2206
02:11:38,099 --> 02:11:42,320
The migrants would work for low wages.

2207
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:45,849
They would work for food.

2208
02:11:45,849 --> 02:11:50,949
And this was good because wages went down
and prices stayed up.

2209
02:11:50,949 --> 02:11:57,150
The landowners were glad and they sent out
more handbills to bring more people in.

2210
02:11:57,150 --> 02:12:04,290
And now the great owners and companies bought
the little farms.

2211
02:12:04,290 --> 02:12:12,179
It was late when Tom Joad drove along a country
road looking for the Weedpatch camp.

2212
02:12:12,179 --> 02:12:15,829
There were few lights in the countryside.

2213
02:12:15,829 --> 02:12:22,039
Ma had been sleeping in the seat and Pa had
been quiet for a long time.

2214
02:12:22,039 --> 02:12:24,520
Tom saw a sign and then stopped.

2215
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:27,840
A high wire fence faced the road.

2216
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:33,749
Tom got out and asked the guard, "Do you have
any room here for us?"

2217
02:12:33,749 --> 02:12:36,849
"I have one place left.

2218
02:12:36,849 --> 02:12:38,929
Drive down to the end of that line.

2219
02:12:38,929 --> 02:12:42,250
You'll be in Unit Four."

2220
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:45,840
Tom drove slowly down the long dark row of
tents.

2221
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,040
"Park here," the guard said.

2222
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:52,539
Al jumped off the truck and walked around.

2223
02:12:52,539 --> 02:12:58,510
Tom said, "You and Pa unload while I go to
the office."

2224
02:12:58,510 --> 02:13:01,389
Tom followed the guard through the dark to
the office.

2225
02:13:01,389 --> 02:13:06,260
The guard sat down at a desk and took out
a form.

2226
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:13,389
While Tom filled in the form, the guard explained,
"The camp costs a dollar a week but you can

2227
02:13:13,389 --> 02:13:19,099
work instead, carrying garbage, keeping the
camp clean - stuff like that."

2228
02:13:19,099 --> 02:13:21,530
"We'll work," Tom said.

2229
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:24,389
"You'll see the committee tomorrow.

2230
02:13:24,389 --> 02:13:29,289
They'll show you how to use the camp and tell
you the rules."

2231
02:13:29,289 --> 02:13:33,170
Tom said, "What committee is this?"

2232
02:13:33,170 --> 02:13:35,340
The guard sat back in his chair.

2233
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,880
"It works pretty nice.

2234
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:39,019
There are five units.

2235
02:13:39,019 --> 02:13:44,539
Each unit elects a central committee and that
committee makes the laws."

2236
02:13:44,539 --> 02:13:48,469
"Do you mean there ain't any cops?"

2237
02:13:48,469 --> 02:13:50,570
"No cops.

2238
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:53,949
No cop can come in here without a reason.

2239
02:13:53,949 --> 02:13:56,230
Now you go get some sleep."

2240
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:59,059
"Good night," said Tom.

2241
02:13:59,059 --> 02:14:02,900
"Good night," said the guard.

2242
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:06,119
Tom returned to the truck and climbed into
the back.

2243
02:14:06,119 --> 02:14:10,340
He lay down on his back on the wooden floor.

2244
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:13,280
The night grew cooler.

2245
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:16,020
Tom buttoned his coat over his chest.

2246
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:21,150
The stars were clear and sharp over his head.

2247
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:25,139
It was dark when he awoke.

2248
02:14:25,139 --> 02:14:30,449
The sound of a cooking pan scratching across
a stove woke him.

2249
02:14:30,449 --> 02:14:36,329
Tom looked down the line of tents and saw
a small orange light outside one of them.

2250
02:14:36,329 --> 02:14:40,940
Then, he saw a girl working around the stove.

2251
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:44,079
He climbed out of the truck and moved closer.

2252
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:47,090
He smelled frying bacon and baking-bread.

2253
02:14:47,090 --> 02:14:53,219
"Good morning," she said and turned the bacon
in the pan.

2254
02:14:53,219 --> 02:14:55,400
Then, two men appeared.

2255
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,619
"Morning," said the older man.

2256
02:14:57,619 --> 02:15:00,449
"Good morning," said Tom.

2257
02:15:00,449 --> 02:15:02,739
And then the younger man said, "Morning."

2258
02:15:02,739 --> 02:15:09,400
Now the older man said to Tom, "Have you had
any breakfast yet?"

2259
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:10,939
"Well, no, I ain't.

2260
02:15:10,939 --> 02:15:13,280
But my folks are over there.

2261
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:14,630
They ain't up.

2262
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:16,309
Need the sleep."

2263
02:15:16,309 --> 02:15:18,539
"Well, sit down with us.

2264
02:15:18,539 --> 02:15:20,400
We have plenty - thank God."

2265
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:23,139
"Thank you," said Tom.

2266
02:15:23,139 --> 02:15:26,519
"It smells so good I can't say no."

2267
02:15:26,519 --> 02:15:33,989
They had all started eating when the younger
man said, "We're laying some pipe.

2268
02:15:33,989 --> 02:15:38,769
If you want to walk over with us, maybe we
can get you some work."

2269
02:15:38,769 --> 02:15:42,520
Tom said, "Well, that's very nice of you.

2270
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,260
And thank you for the breakfast."

2271
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:50,750
After they finished eating, the men got up
and Tom said, "Just wait a minute.

2272
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:53,889
I have to go tell my folks."

2273
02:15:53,889 --> 02:15:57,360
Tom hurried back to the Joad tent.

2274
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:01,030
Ruthie was awake and looking around outside.

2275
02:16:01,030 --> 02:16:04,510
He moved up to her and said, "Listen.

2276
02:16:04,510 --> 02:16:10,340
Don't wake anybody up, but when they get up,
tell them I have a chance at a job.

2277
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:14,679
And tell Ma I ate breakfast with the neighbors."

2278
02:16:14,679 --> 02:16:17,689
Ruthie agreed and turned her head away.

2279
02:16:17,689 --> 02:16:22,390
She then walked toward a large building with
an open door.

2280
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:27,400
The camp had begun to come to life.

2281
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:32,920
At the new fires the women worked, slicing
meat, making the bread.

2282
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:37,420
And the men were moving around the tents and
the cars.

2283
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:41,500
The sun showed its edge over the mountains.

2284
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:46,040
Tom went back to the neighbors and said, "It
seems funny.

2285
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:51,890
I've eaten your food, and I ain't told you
my name - I'm Tom Joad."

2286
02:16:51,890 --> 02:16:58,980
The older man said, "Well, I'm Timothy Wallace,
and this is my boy, Wilkie."

2287
02:16:58,980 --> 02:17:01,620
Tom said, "Have you been here long?"

2288
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:04,219
"Ten months," Wilkie said.

2289
02:17:04,219 --> 02:17:08,090
"We're working for a Mr. Thomas," Timothy
said.

2290
02:17:08,090 --> 02:17:09,610
"Nice job."

2291
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:12,360
Tom asked, "Don't you have a car?"

2292
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:17,510
Both Wallaces were silent, and Tom saw that
they were embarrassed.

2293
02:17:17,510 --> 02:17:22,130
Timothy said, "No, we don't have a car.

2294
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:23,870
We sold our car.

2295
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:26,030
Had to, for food.

2296
02:17:26,030 --> 02:17:27,640
Couldn't get a job."

2297
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:34,090
They turned off the highway and walked down
a small road.

2298
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:37,490
Behind some trees they came to a small white
farmhouse.

2299
02:17:37,490 --> 02:17:45,070
As the three men walked past the house, a
door banged shut and a heavy sunburned man

2300
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:47,250
came down the back steps.

2301
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:50,340
"Morning, Mr. Thomas," Timothy said.

2302
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:51,540
"Good morning."

2303
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:53,320
The man spoke angrily.

2304
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:57,270
Timothy said, "This is Tom Joad.

2305
02:17:57,270 --> 02:18:01,480
We wondered if you need another pair of hands?"

2306
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:04,890
Thomas looked hard at Tom and then laughed.

2307
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:05,990
"Oh, sure!

2308
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:07,091
I'll take him.

2309
02:18:07,091 --> 02:18:08,850
I'll take everybody.

2310
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:10,830
Maybe I'll take a hundred men."

2311
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:15,850
"We just thought - " Timothy said, apologizing.

2312
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:17,160
Mr. Thomas stopped him.

2313
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:20,440
"Yes, I've been thinking, too."

2314
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:22,210
He turned around to face them.

2315
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:25,190
"I've been paying you thirty cents an hour,
right?"

2316
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:26,190
"Yes, Mr. Thomas."

2317
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:31,990
"Well, this morning you're getting twenty-five
cents an hour, and you can take it or leave

2318
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:32,990
it."

2319
02:18:32,990 --> 02:18:36,680
His face became red with anger.

2320
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:40,070
Timothy said, "We've given you good work.

2321
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:41,580
You said so yourself."

2322
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:42,580
"I know.

2323
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:47,080
But it seems like I'm not hiring my own men
now," he said.

2324
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,660
"Did you ever hear of the Farmers' Association?"

2325
02:18:50,660 --> 02:18:51,660
"Sure."

2326
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:54,330
"Well, I belong to it.

2327
02:18:54,330 --> 02:18:56,010
We had a meeting last night.

2328
02:18:56,010 --> 02:18:59,179
Now, do you know who runs the Farmers' Association?

2329
02:18:59,179 --> 02:19:01,230
I'll tell you.

2330
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:03,690
The Bank of the West.

2331
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:06,900
That bank owns most of this valley.

2332
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:11,830
A person from the bank told me, 'You're paying
thirty cents an hour.

2333
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:13,122
You need to cut it down to twenty-five.

2334
02:19:13,122 --> 02:19:17,150
The wage is now twenty-five.

2335
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:19,710
If you pay thirty, it'll cause problems.'

2336
02:19:19,710 --> 02:19:26,750
And, he said to me, 'You're going to need
to borrow money for another crop next year.'"

2337
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:28,070
Mr. Thomas stopped.

2338
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:29,860
His breathing was heavy.

2339
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:34,890
"You see, I have no choice."

2340
02:19:34,890 --> 02:19:36,480
Timothy shook his head.

2341
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:39,290
"I don't know what to say."

2342
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:42,380
"Now, are you going to work?

2343
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:44,330
Twenty-five cents?"

2344
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:46,040
Timothy looked at the ground.

2345
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:47,930
"I'll work."

2346
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:51,880
"Me too," said Wilkie.

2347
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:55,400
Tom said, "It seems like I walked into something.

2348
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:57,211
Sure, I'll work.

2349
02:19:57,211 --> 02:19:59,540
I have to."

2350
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:02,061
Mr. Thomas wiped his mouth and chin.

2351
02:20:02,061 --> 02:20:05,580
"I don't know how long this can go on.

2352
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:08,830
I don't know how you men can feed a family
on what you get."

2353
02:20:08,830 --> 02:20:11,521
He looked at his watch.

2354
02:20:11,521 --> 02:20:14,811
"Well, I'm going to tell you something.

2355
02:20:14,811 --> 02:20:17,540
You fellows live in the government camp, don't
you?"

2356
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:19,470
Timothy said, "Yes."

2357
02:20:19,470 --> 02:20:23,440
"And you have dances every Saturday night?"

2358
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:24,780
Wilkie smiled.

2359
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:26,950
"We sure do."

2360
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:29,730
Mr. Thomas looked worried.

2361
02:20:29,730 --> 02:20:32,460
"Don't tell anyone that I told you.

2362
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:36,150
The Association doesn't like the government
camps.

2363
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:38,210
They can't get cops in there.

2364
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:45,720
But if there was a big fight and maybe shooting,
then they could send cops in.

2365
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:47,910
Don't you ever tell where you heard this.

2366
02:20:47,910 --> 02:20:54,960
But there's going to be a fight this Saturday
night and the cops will be ready to go in."

2367
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:57,200
Tom demanded, "Why?

2368
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,920
Those folks aren't bothering anybody."

2369
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:02,391
"Go on to work," Mr. Thomas said.

2370
02:21:02,391 --> 02:21:06,330
"And it's twenty-five cents an hour."

2371
02:21:06,330 --> 02:21:09,171
He walked toward the house.

2372
02:21:09,171 --> 02:21:13,590
The three men walked out past the little barn
and along a field.

2373
02:21:13,590 --> 02:21:19,311
They came to a long narrow hole with pieces
of pipe lying beside it.

2374
02:21:19,311 --> 02:21:25,601
They picked up shovels and began to work.

2375
02:21:25,601 --> 02:21:33,880
Ruthie walked carefully into the entrance
of the Joad tent and looked inside.

2376
02:21:33,880 --> 02:21:37,670
Winfield saw her and got out from under the
blanket.

2377
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:41,180
Ma and Pa and the others were still asleep.

2378
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:44,000
"Come on," Ruthie whispered.

2379
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,880
They went into the large building.

2380
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:51,251
The toilets were lined up on one side of the
room.

2381
02:21:51,251 --> 02:21:53,301
"There," said Ruthie.

2382
02:21:53,301 --> 02:21:55,891
"Those are toilets.

2383
02:21:55,891 --> 02:21:58,610
I've seen them in a magazine."

2384
02:21:58,610 --> 02:22:01,630
The children went near to one of the toilets.

2385
02:22:01,630 --> 02:22:04,000
Winfield was embarrassed.

2386
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,521
His hand twisted the lever.

2387
02:22:06,521 --> 02:22:10,000
There was a loud sound as the water ran into
the toilet.

2388
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,820
The children jumped into the air and stepped
away.

2389
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:15,721
The sound of running water continued.

2390
02:22:15,721 --> 02:22:18,860
"You broke it," Ruthie said.

2391
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:20,230
"Did not."

2392
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:23,970
The two children hurried back to the tent.

2393
02:22:23,970 --> 02:22:30,070
The sun was coming up just over the mountain
and the camp was waking up.

2394
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:32,800
The fires were burning in camp stoves.

2395
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:36,230
The smell of smoke was in the air.

2396
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:38,750
Ma stood outside the tent.

2397
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:41,290
She saw the children and came over to them.

2398
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:43,771
"I was worried," Ma said.

2399
02:22:43,771 --> 02:22:45,401
"I didn't know where you were."

2400
02:22:45,401 --> 02:22:49,360
"We were just looking," Ruthie said.

2401
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:51,230
"Well, where's Tom?

2402
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:52,521
Have you seen him?"

2403
02:22:52,521 --> 02:22:54,470
Ruthie became important.

2404
02:22:54,470 --> 02:22:55,950
"Yes, Ma.

2405
02:22:55,950 --> 02:23:00,090
He said to tell you he got work."

2406
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:02,410
Ma looked back into the tent.

2407
02:23:02,410 --> 02:23:04,660
"Pa," she called excitedly.

2408
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:06,230
"John, get up!

2409
02:23:06,230 --> 02:23:09,180
You, Al, get up and get washed.

2410
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:11,990
All of you, get up and get washed.

2411
02:23:11,990 --> 02:23:14,190
Tom's gone out and got some work.

2412
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:16,450
Now get up!"

2413
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:21,891
Rosasharn said sadly, "I don't feel good.

2414
02:23:21,891 --> 02:23:23,870
I want Connie."

2415
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:27,920
A frying pan smoked over the fire.

2416
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:30,960
The smell of coffee began to fill the air.

2417
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:33,831
Pa wandered back from the wash tubs.

2418
02:23:33,831 --> 02:23:37,820
He said, "Did you say that Tom's got work?"

2419
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:38,820
"Yes.

2420
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:42,410
He went out before we woke up," Ma said.

2421
02:23:42,410 --> 02:23:47,420
After they ate, Al got in the truck.

2422
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,731
"I have to get gas," he said.

2423
02:23:50,731 --> 02:23:51,771
He started the engine.

2424
02:23:51,771 --> 02:23:59,011
Pa and Uncle John climbed in beside him and
the truck moved away down the street.

2425
02:23:59,011 --> 02:24:02,001
Rosasharn came over to Ma.

2426
02:24:02,001 --> 02:24:08,830
"They have hot and cold water and the water
comes flooding down," the girl said.

2427
02:24:08,830 --> 02:24:13,820
"Well, I'm going to have a bath after I finish
here," Ma said.

2428
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:17,480
"I'm going to have one every day," Rosasharn
said.

2429
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:19,860
"There was a lady in there, too.

2430
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:23,910
And she said that there's a nurse who comes
every week.

2431
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:28,820
The nurse will tell me what to do so the baby's
strong."

2432
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:34,420
Ma said, "Praise God."

2433
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:41,080
The truck moved along the beautiful roads,
past fines of peach trees that were beginning

2434
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:42,080
to color.

2435
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:49,601
At each entrance gate Al slowed and at each
gate there was a sign: No Help Wanted.

2436
02:24:49,601 --> 02:24:50,920
No Trespassing.

2437
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:56,030
Then Al said, "How are you feeling, Uncle
John?"

2438
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:59,430
"I ache," said Uncle John.

2439
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:04,120
"I ache all over and I deserve it.

2440
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:08,851
I ought to go away where I don't bring problems
to my own folks."

2441
02:25:08,851 --> 02:25:12,540
Pa put his hand on John's knee.

2442
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:17,000
"Listen," he said, "don't you go running away.

2443
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:26,910
We're losing folks all the time - Grandpa
and Grandma dead - Noah and Connie gone - and

2444
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:28,460
the preacher in jail."

2445
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:34,590
They drove back to the camp in silence.

2446
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:38,351
Ma got up when she saw Pa coming down the
street.

2447
02:25:38,351 --> 02:25:43,311
He came near and she said, "Did you get any
work?"

2448
02:25:43,311 --> 02:25:45,920
"No," he said ashamed.

2449
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:48,460
"We looked."

2450
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:51,730
Ma said sadly, "This is a nice place.

2451
02:25:51,730 --> 02:25:54,740
We could be happy here."

2452
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:58,000
"If we got some work."

2453
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,450
She looked at him and she closed her eyes
slowly.

2454
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:07,880
Pa said, "I saw some birds today heading south."

2455
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:09,660
Ma smiled.

2456
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:10,730
"Remember?"

2457
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:11,730
she said.

2458
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:14,980
"Remember what we always said at home.

2459
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:19,610
Winter's coming early when the birds fly."

2460
02:26:19,610 --> 02:26:21,740
She looked gently at Pa.

2461
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:25,011
"I think about home too.

2462
02:26:25,011 --> 02:26:26,860
I want to forget it.

2463
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:28,820
And Noah."

2464
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:33,070
The next day was Saturday.

2465
02:26:33,070 --> 02:26:39,030
Wilkie went over to another young man and
said, "Have you heard about tonight?"

2466
02:26:39,030 --> 02:26:41,240
The young man smiled, "Yeah!"

2467
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:43,460
"What have you done?"

2468
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:44,460
Wilkie asked.

2469
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:48,720
"Well, I have twenty more men - all good strong
boys.

2470
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:53,171
They're going to dance and keep their eyes
open and their ears open.

2471
02:26:53,171 --> 02:26:58,050
And at the first sign of any talk or argument,
they'll close in tight.

2472
02:26:58,050 --> 02:27:03,261
When they move out, the fellows will go out
with them."

2473
02:27:03,261 --> 02:27:07,920
"Tell them they mustn't hurt the fellows."

2474
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:13,210
And now the evening darkness was falling and
the practicing of the string band seemed to

2475
02:27:13,210 --> 02:27:15,510
grow louder.

2476
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:18,851
Around the camp, the guards sat in the grass
and waited.

2477
02:27:18,851 --> 02:27:26,030
The cars of guests began to arrive, small
farmers and their families, migrants from

2478
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:27,061
other camps.

2479
02:27:27,061 --> 02:27:32,860
And as each guest came through the gate, he
mentioned the name of the camper who invited

2480
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:34,150
him.

2481
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:39,420
Pa and Uncle John were sitting with a group
of men by the office.

2482
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:42,660
"We nearly got work today," Pa said.

2483
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:46,950
"We were just a few minutes late."

2484
02:27:46,950 --> 02:27:50,670
Tom stood at the gate and watched people coming
into the dance.

2485
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:55,040
Jule, half Cherokee Indian, stood next to
Tom.

2486
02:27:55,040 --> 02:28:01,110
Then three young men came through the gate
- young working men in jeans.

2487
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:04,690
"I think those are our fellows," Jule said.

2488
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:06,271
"How do you know?"

2489
02:28:06,271 --> 02:28:07,790
"I don't know.

2490
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:11,500
I just feel it," Jule said.

2491
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,860
The dancing started.

2492
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:22,040
Boys and girls, men and women moved around
creating large squares on a large platform.

2493
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:28,320
Ma and Rosasharn sat and watched around the
platform with some of the old folks and children.

2494
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:35,921
The three young men walked onto the platform
and one said, "I'll dance with this girl here."

2495
02:28:35,921 --> 02:28:38,931
A blond boy looked up in surprise.

2496
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:40,290
"She's my partner."

2497
02:28:40,290 --> 02:28:44,380
"Listen, you little fool."

2498
02:28:44,380 --> 02:28:47,311
Off in the darkness, a whistle sounded.

2499
02:28:47,311 --> 02:28:49,500
The three were walled in now.

2500
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:54,040
And each one felt hands tightly on their wrists.

2501
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:58,580
And then the wall of men moved slowly off
the platform.

2502
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:02,340
A large car drove to the entrance.

2503
02:29:02,340 --> 02:29:04,460
The driver called, "Open up.

2504
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:07,210
We hear you have a fight."

2505
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:08,660
The guard did not move.

2506
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:11,330
"We don't have a fight here.

2507
02:29:11,330 --> 02:29:12,980
Listen to that music.

2508
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:14,760
Who are you?"

2509
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:15,760
"Police.

2510
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,760
Open up."

2511
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:18,320
"Got a reason?"

2512
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:21,811
"We don't need one if there's a fight here."

2513
02:29:21,811 --> 02:29:26,671
"Well, there's no fight here," said the guard.

2514
02:29:26,671 --> 02:29:33,150
The men in the car listened to the music and
then moved slowly away and parked across the

2515
02:29:33,150 --> 02:29:35,370
road and waited.

2516
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:36,900
CHAPTER EIGHT

2517
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:37,900
Migrant Work

2518
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:46,351
The companies and banks that owned the large
farms also owned the factories that canned

2519
02:29:46,351 --> 02:29:47,351
the fruit.

2520
02:29:47,351 --> 02:29:54,040
They paid the pickers low wages and made the
price of fresh fruit go down.

2521
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:58,190
The little farmers watched debt come up on
them like the tide.

2522
02:29:58,190 --> 02:30:04,500
They could not pay wages for pickers and they
could not pick the crop.

2523
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:06,510
The fruit was burned.

2524
02:30:06,510 --> 02:30:13,260
A million people hungry, needing the fruit,
and the fruit was burned.

2525
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:21,610
In the Weedpatch camp, on a quiet evening,
the Joad family sat around after supper.

2526
02:30:21,610 --> 02:30:25,391
"We have to do something," Ma said.

2527
02:30:25,391 --> 02:30:27,440
"One month we've been here.

2528
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:29,931
And Tom had five days of work.

2529
02:30:29,931 --> 02:30:34,760
And the rest of you looking every day and
no work."

2530
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:36,250
They looked at the ground.

2531
02:30:36,250 --> 02:30:39,141
"We have to go," Pa said.

2532
02:30:39,141 --> 02:30:41,521
"We don't want to go.

2533
02:30:41,521 --> 02:30:42,840
It's nice here.

2534
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:44,840
The folks are nice.

2535
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:47,351
We don't want to live in one of those Hoovervilles."

2536
02:30:47,351 --> 02:30:52,540
"But if we have to, we have to," Ma said.

2537
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:55,040
"We have to eat."

2538
02:30:55,040 --> 02:31:01,180
Uncle John said, "A fellow said that there's
cotton near Tulare.

2539
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:03,500
It's not very far, the fellow said."

2540
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:06,070
"Well, we have to go quick.

2541
02:31:06,070 --> 02:31:10,721
I ain't staying here, though it's nice."

2542
02:31:10,721 --> 02:31:14,790
Ma picked up her bucket and walked toward
the water pipe.

2543
02:31:14,790 --> 02:31:17,110
She returned with a bucket of hot water.

2544
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:20,580
"We'll go in the morning."

2545
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:22,000
She looked at Rosasharn.

2546
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,870
"Are you feeling all right?"

2547
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:31,380
"I ain't had the milk the nurse said I should
have," the girl said softly.

2548
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:33,120
"I know.

2549
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,291
We just don't have any milk."

2550
02:31:36,291 --> 02:31:43,540
Rosasharn said sadly, "If Connie hadn't gone
away, we would have had a little house by

2551
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:45,360
now, with him studying.

2552
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:48,540
I'd have the milk I need.

2553
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:50,931
I'd have a nice baby."

2554
02:31:50,931 --> 02:31:54,461
"We'll get you some milk soon."

2555
02:31:54,461 --> 02:31:59,421
It was still dark when Ma woke up her camp.

2556
02:31:59,421 --> 02:32:01,500
"Come on, get up.

2557
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:05,141
We have to get on our way."

2558
02:32:05,141 --> 02:32:08,910
She slipped on her dress over the underclothes
she wore to bed.

2559
02:32:08,910 --> 02:32:11,730
"We don't have any coffee," she said.

2560
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:14,420
"I have a few pieces of bread.

2561
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:16,320
We can eat them on the road.

2562
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:19,271
Just get up now and we'll load the truck.

2563
02:32:19,271 --> 02:32:21,450
Don't make any noise.

2564
02:32:21,450 --> 02:32:24,590
Don't want to wake up the neighbors."

2565
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:26,131
The family dressed.

2566
02:32:26,131 --> 02:32:30,120
The men pulled down the tent and loaded up
the truck.

2567
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:33,120
"All right, Ma," Tom said.

2568
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:34,811
"We're ready."

2569
02:32:34,811 --> 02:32:38,171
Ma held the pieces of bread in her hand.

2570
02:32:38,171 --> 02:32:40,101
"Now just one each.

2571
02:32:40,101 --> 02:32:41,990
That's all we have."

2572
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:47,931
Ruthie and Winfield took their bread and climbed
into the truck and covered themselves with

2573
02:32:47,931 --> 02:32:51,700
a blanket and fell asleep again.

2574
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:55,760
Tom got into the driver's seat and started
the engine.

2575
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:04,021
The light morning traffic moved speedily by
on the highway, and the sun grew warm and

2576
02:33:04,021 --> 02:33:05,021
bright.

2577
02:33:05,021 --> 02:33:08,920
The family stopped to fix a flat tire.

2578
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:13,351
Tom was pumping the tire when a small truck
stopped beside them.

2579
02:33:13,351 --> 02:33:19,280
A man dressed in a gray business suit got
out and walked over to Tom.

2580
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:23,141
"Good morning," he said pleasantly.

2581
02:33:23,141 --> 02:33:25,000
Tom stopped pumping and looked up.

2582
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
"Good morning."

2583
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,801
The man ran his fingers through his graying
hair.

2584
02:33:30,801 --> 02:33:33,561
"Are you people looking for work?"

2585
02:33:33,561 --> 02:33:36,150
"We sure are, mister."

2586
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:40,630
"Well, there's plenty of work for you about
forty miles north, picking peaches."

2587
02:33:40,630 --> 02:33:45,090
"If you tell us how to get there, we'll go
now," Tom said.

2588
02:33:45,090 --> 02:33:49,341
"Well, you go north to Pixley, that's thirty-five
miles.

2589
02:33:49,341 --> 02:33:53,230
Then you turn east and go for about six miles.

2590
02:33:53,230 --> 02:33:56,211
Ask anybody where the Hooper Ranch is."

2591
02:33:56,211 --> 02:33:59,700
"Thank you, mister," said Tom.

2592
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:03,300
The man tipped his hat and drove off.

2593
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:06,921
Tom and Al threw the tools into the car.

2594
02:34:06,921 --> 02:34:09,480
"Come on, let's go," Tom called.

2595
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:13,891
"We're going to get some work at last."

2596
02:34:13,891 --> 02:34:20,381
They drove through the sunny morning fields.

2597
02:34:20,381 --> 02:34:27,190
Ma said excitedly, "With four men working,
we can buy coffee, and meat, and milk.

2598
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:30,251
The nurse said Rosasharn needs milk."

2599
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:36,820
Al said, "I'm going to save some money and
then I'm going into a town and getting a job

2600
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:37,851
at a garage.

2601
02:34:37,851 --> 02:34:42,501
I'll live in a nice room and eat at restaurants."

2602
02:34:42,501 --> 02:34:49,800
As they came near to the Hooper Ranch, the
road was suddenly blocked with cars.

2603
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:54,230
A line of white motorcycles was parked along
the roadside.

2604
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:57,920
"It looks like an accident," Tom said.

2605
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:05,641
A policeman came walking down the road and
held up his hand and Al stopped the truck.

2606
02:35:05,641 --> 02:35:08,200
The policeman leaned on the side of the car.

2607
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:11,250
"Where are you going?" he asked.

2608
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:15,570
Al said, "A fellow said that there was work
here picking peaches."

2609
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:18,880
"Want to work, do you?"

2610
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:20,860
"Sure do," said Tom.

2611
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:22,061
"OK.

2612
02:35:22,061 --> 02:35:23,061
Wait here a minute."

2613
02:35:23,061 --> 02:35:28,341
He moved to the side of the road and called,
"One more.

2614
02:35:28,341 --> 02:35:29,740
That's six cars ready.

2615
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:31,431
We'd better take them through."

2616
02:35:31,431 --> 02:35:36,800
Then a group of motorcycles came toward the
line of six cars.

2617
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:41,130
The Joad truck was directed to the back of
the line.

2618
02:35:41,130 --> 02:35:46,670
Two motorcycles led the way and two followed
at the back.

2619
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:50,170
Tom said anxiously, "I wonder what's wrong."

2620
02:35:50,170 --> 02:35:53,830
"Maybe the road's closed," Al suggested.

2621
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:57,110
"They don't need four cops to lead us.

2622
02:35:57,110 --> 02:35:58,990
I don't like it."

2623
02:35:58,990 --> 02:36:04,440
Suddenly, the leading policeman turned off
the road into a wide entrance.

2624
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:07,330
The old cars followed.

2625
02:36:07,330 --> 02:36:13,730
Tom saw a line of men along the side of the
road, screaming and shaking their fists.

2626
02:36:13,730 --> 02:36:19,400
When they were away from the entrance, the
six cars were told to stop.

2627
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:23,950
Two men with large notebooks went from car
to car.

2628
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:26,010
"Do you want to work?"

2629
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:27,470
"Sure," Tom said.

2630
02:36:27,470 --> 02:36:28,930
"But, what is this?"

2631
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:30,410
"It's not your business.

2632
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:31,950
Do you want to work?"

2633
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:33,840
"Sure we do."

2634
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,040
"OK.

2635
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:37,070
Find house number sixty-three.

2636
02:36:37,070 --> 02:36:39,440
Wages are five cents a box.

2637
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:40,601
All right.

2638
02:36:40,601 --> 02:36:43,870
Move along now Go to work right away."

2639
02:36:43,870 --> 02:36:50,980
Al parked the truck close to the door of the
little house with number sixty-three on it.

2640
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:55,180
The family came down from the truck and stood
around looking puzzled.

2641
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:58,760
Two policemen approached them.

2642
02:36:58,760 --> 02:36:59,760
"Name?"

2643
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:01,021
"Joad," Tom said.

2644
02:37:01,021 --> 02:37:02,570
"What's going on?"

2645
02:37:02,570 --> 02:37:05,800
"Now, we don't want any trouble with you.

2646
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:10,050
Just do your work and mind your own business
and you'll be all right."

2647
02:37:10,050 --> 02:37:12,160
The two walked away.

2648
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:18,710
After they unloaded the truck, the four men
took their buckets and went into the field.

2649
02:37:18,710 --> 02:37:22,590
"The owner here doesn't waste any time," Tom
said.

2650
02:37:22,590 --> 02:37:27,690
Ruthie and Winfield helped by putting the
peaches into boxes.

2651
02:37:27,690 --> 02:37:30,851
They worked steadily through the afternoon.

2652
02:37:30,851 --> 02:37:36,240
When Tom finished the twentieth box, he got
a credit note for one dollar and took it to

2653
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:37,240
Ma.

2654
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:38,570
"Here you are.

2655
02:37:38,570 --> 02:37:42,070
You can get a dollar's worth of stuff at the
store."

2656
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:44,330
Ma hurried to the store.

2657
02:37:44,330 --> 02:37:46,280
She opened the screen door and went in.

2658
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:50,000
A tiny man stood behind the counter.

2659
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,970
"Good afternoon," Ma said.

2660
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:54,360
"Hi," he said.

2661
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:56,751
"I'd like some meat, please."

2662
02:37:56,751 --> 02:38:00,570
"I have all kinds of meat," he said.

2663
02:38:00,570 --> 02:38:01,870
"Hamburger, twenty cents a pound."

2664
02:38:01,870 --> 02:38:02,870
"Ain't that high?

2665
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:09,050
It seems to me hamburger was fifteen the last
time I got some."

2666
02:38:09,050 --> 02:38:11,080
"Well," he laughed softly, "yes, it's high.

2667
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:17,740
But if you go into town for a couple of pounds
of hamburger, it will cost you about a gallon

2668
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:19,540
of gas."

2669
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:21,880
Ma looked at him angrily for a moment.

2670
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:25,450
"Ain't you got some cheaper kind of meat?"

2671
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:27,740
"Soup bones," he said.

2672
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:29,460
"Ten cents a pound."

2673
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:31,851
"But those are just bones."

2674
02:38:31,851 --> 02:38:35,630
"Well, you can go into town and get it for
less.

2675
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:37,960
A gallon of gas."

2676
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:40,280
"OK," Ma said.

2677
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:46,610
"Two pounds of hamburger, a loaf of bread,
and five pounds of potatoes, and a bag of

2678
02:38:46,610 --> 02:38:47,610
coffee.

2679
02:38:47,610 --> 02:38:48,670
How much is that?"

2680
02:38:48,670 --> 02:38:52,190
"That's one dollar exactly," he said.

2681
02:38:52,190 --> 02:38:53,190
"What?

2682
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:55,440
These are high prices.

2683
02:38:55,440 --> 02:38:58,381
Who owns this store?"

2684
02:38:58,381 --> 02:38:59,851
"Hooper Ranch.

2685
02:38:59,851 --> 02:39:01,660
But if you want better prices..."

2686
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:05,580
"I know, I can go into town."

2687
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:10,760
Ma's face was hard as she handed the man her
credit note for one dollar.

2688
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:19,070
Tom and Al and Pa and Uncle John walked away
from the peach trees.

2689
02:39:19,070 --> 02:39:23,160
Their feet were a little heavy on the road.

2690
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:29,340
Tom said, "Pa, after we eat I'm going to walk
out and see what was going on outside that

2691
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:30,340
gate.

2692
02:39:30,340 --> 02:39:31,800
Do you want to come?"

2693
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:33,580
"No," Pa said.

2694
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:35,931
"I'm going to rest.

2695
02:39:35,931 --> 02:39:38,280
I'm tired from all of that picking."

2696
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:40,561
"How about you, Al?"

2697
02:39:40,561 --> 02:39:44,090
"I want to look around here first," he said.

2698
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:46,630
"Well, I know Uncle John won't come.

2699
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:48,210
I guess I'll go alone."

2700
02:39:48,210 --> 02:39:54,521
The dinner was cooking and the Joad house
was full of smoke.

2701
02:39:54,521 --> 02:40:00,011
Ma worked quickly near the fire while Rosasharn
rested on a box.

2702
02:40:00,011 --> 02:40:01,011
The men came in.

2703
02:40:01,011 --> 02:40:04,521
"Meat, by God!" said Tom.

2704
02:40:04,521 --> 02:40:05,540
"And coffee.

2705
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:07,080
I smell it.

2706
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:08,920
I'm sure hungry."

2707
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:14,950
They ate silently and wiped their plates with
bread.

2708
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:19,160
The children put their plates on the floor
and ate like little animals.

2709
02:40:19,160 --> 02:40:25,440
Tom swallowed the last piece of bread and
said, "Do you have any more, Ma?"

2710
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:26,500
"No," she said.

2711
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:27,500
"That's all.

2712
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:31,390
You made a dollar, and that's a dollar's worth.

2713
02:40:31,390 --> 02:40:34,251
They charge extra out here."

2714
02:40:34,251 --> 02:40:36,960
"I ain't full," said Tom.

2715
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:41,720
"Well, tomorrow you'll work a full day."

2716
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:42,750
Al wiped his mouth.

2717
02:40:42,750 --> 02:40:45,780
"I guess I'll take a look around."

2718
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:48,870
"Wait, I'll go with you," Tom said.

2719
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:54,340
The two walked out of the house together but
then went separate ways.

2720
02:40:54,340 --> 02:40:57,630
Tom walked over to the high wire gate.

2721
02:40:57,630 --> 02:41:00,370
A figure stood beside the road.

2722
02:41:00,370 --> 02:41:02,070
A voice said, "Hello.

2723
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:03,521
Who is it?

2724
02:41:03,521 --> 02:41:05,461
Where are you going?"

2725
02:41:05,461 --> 02:41:08,090
"Well, I thought I'd take a walk."

2726
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:10,420
"You'll have to go another way."

2727
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:12,510
"Can't I get out of here?"

2728
02:41:12,510 --> 02:41:13,590
Tom asked.

2729
02:41:13,590 --> 02:41:15,400
"Not tonight you can't.

2730
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:18,171
Those crazy troublemakers might get you.

2731
02:41:18,171 --> 02:41:19,891
"What troublemakers?"

2732
02:41:19,891 --> 02:41:22,880
"You saw them when you came in, didn't you?"

2733
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:25,051
"Well, I saw a bunch of men.

2734
02:41:25,051 --> 02:41:28,820
I thought it was an accident," Tom said.

2735
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:33,910
He then walked away from the gate until the
guard couldn't see him.

2736
02:41:33,910 --> 02:41:39,960
He heard some voices in the distance and hurried
off the road into an area full of bushes and

2737
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:41,881
tall grass.

2738
02:41:41,881 --> 02:41:47,210
He climbed over a wire fence and moved down
through the thick grass until he came to a

2739
02:41:47,210 --> 02:41:48,210
stream.

2740
02:41:48,210 --> 02:41:51,530
Then he followed the voices along the stream.

2741
02:41:51,530 --> 02:41:55,790
He stopped when he saw a man on a box in front
of a tent.

2742
02:41:55,790 --> 02:41:57,771
"Good evening," Tom said.

2743
02:41:57,771 --> 02:41:58,971
"Who are you?

2744
02:41:58,971 --> 02:42:02,510
Do you know anybody here?"

2745
02:42:02,510 --> 02:42:03,510
"No.

2746
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:04,510
I was just going past."

2747
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:07,510
A head appeared from the tent.

2748
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:10,570
A voice said, "What's the matter?"

2749
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:11,840
"Casy!"

2750
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:13,101
Tom cried.

2751
02:42:13,101 --> 02:42:14,131
"Casy.

2752
02:42:14,131 --> 02:42:15,940
What are you doing here?"

2753
02:42:15,940 --> 02:42:17,580
"My God.

2754
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:19,620
It's Tom Joad!

2755
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:20,870
Come on in, Tommy."

2756
02:42:20,870 --> 02:42:22,570
"Do you know him?"

2757
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:24,240
the man in front asked.

2758
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:27,900
"Yeah, I've known him for years," said Casy.

2759
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:30,750
He pulled Tom into the tent.

2760
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:35,540
Three other men sat on the ground in the middle
of the tent.

2761
02:42:35,540 --> 02:42:38,740
One man got up and said, "Glad to meet you.

2762
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:41,311
This is the fellow you told us about?"

2763
02:42:41,311 --> 02:42:42,311
"Sure.

2764
02:42:42,311 --> 02:42:43,990
This is him.

2765
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:45,351
Where are your folks, Tom?

2766
02:42:45,351 --> 02:42:48,050
What are you doing here?"

2767
02:42:48,050 --> 02:42:52,840
"Well," said Tom, "we heard that there was
some work this way.

2768
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:56,040
And I saw a bunch of fellows screaming outside
the gate.

2769
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:58,790
But the guards wouldn't tell us anything.

2770
02:42:58,790 --> 02:43:03,040
So, I came out here to see what's going on.

2771
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,110
How did you get here, Casy?"

2772
02:43:05,110 --> 02:43:09,601
"A jailhouse is a funny place," the preacher
said.

2773
02:43:09,601 --> 02:43:14,710
"I met lots of men who stole stuff because
they couldn't get it any other way.

2774
02:43:14,710 --> 02:43:16,440
Do you see?"

2775
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:18,860
"No," Tom said.

2776
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:22,341
"Well, maybe I can't tell you.

2777
02:43:22,341 --> 02:43:25,680
Maybe you have to see for yourself."

2778
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,870
Casy put his chin on his hands.

2779
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:30,521
"How's your sister?"

2780
02:43:30,521 --> 02:43:33,390
"She's as big as a cow.

2781
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:35,351
But you ain't told me what's going on."

2782
02:43:35,351 --> 02:43:41,000
The oldest man said, "This is a strike."

2783
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:47,240
"Well, five cents a box isn't much, but a
fellow can eat," Tom said.

2784
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:48,840
"Five cents?"

2785
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:50,771
the older man said.

2786
02:43:50,771 --> 02:43:54,260
A heavy silence fell in the tent.

2787
02:43:54,260 --> 02:43:56,750
Casy stared out the entrance.

2788
02:43:56,750 --> 02:43:58,230
"Tom," he said at last.

2789
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:59,230
"We came here to work.

2790
02:43:59,230 --> 02:44:04,200
They said that it was going to be five cents.

2791
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:08,730
But when we got here, it was only two and
a half cents.

2792
02:44:08,730 --> 02:44:10,961
A fellow can't eat on that.

2793
02:44:10,961 --> 02:44:13,160
So, we said we won't take it.

2794
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:15,660
So, they threw us out.

2795
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:17,820
Tell your folks, Tom.

2796
02:44:17,820 --> 02:44:21,540
As soon as we're gone, they'll start paying
you two and a half cents."

2797
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:25,740
"Well, I'll try to tell them," Tom said.

2798
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:30,480
"It's hard to talk around here with all those
guys walking around with guns."

2799
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:32,860
"Tell them, Tom."

2800
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:35,200
The older man said, "Sh.

2801
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,980
I hear something."

2802
02:44:36,980 --> 02:44:42,221
They all listened to the soft sound of footsteps
walking near.

2803
02:44:42,221 --> 02:44:44,540
"Let's go," said Casy.

2804
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:47,561
They moved quickly along the edge of the stream.

2805
02:44:47,561 --> 02:44:51,670
Then a voice called out, "There they are!"

2806
02:44:51,670 --> 02:44:56,390
Two flashlight beams fell on the men, caught
them, blinded them.

2807
02:44:56,390 --> 02:44:58,280
"Stand where you are.

2808
02:44:58,280 --> 02:44:59,630
That's him."

2809
02:44:59,630 --> 02:45:04,140
Casy said, "Listen, you fellows don't know
what you're doing.

2810
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:06,720
You're helping to kill kids."

2811
02:45:06,720 --> 02:45:10,710
A heavy man swung a large stick at Casy.

2812
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:16,431
The stick crashed into the side of his head
and Casy fell sideways out of the light.

2813
02:45:16,431 --> 02:45:21,931
"Oh God, George, I think you killed him,"
a voice said.

2814
02:45:21,931 --> 02:45:23,640
Tom looked down at the preacher.

2815
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:29,050
Then, he jumped silently at the man with the
stick and pulled it from his hands.

2816
02:45:29,050 --> 02:45:32,000
He swung once and hit the man's shoulder.

2817
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,530
He swung again and hit him hard on the head.

2818
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:38,490
The large body sank to the ground.

2819
02:45:38,490 --> 02:45:42,040
Tom hit his head three more times.

2820
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:46,021
There were shouts, the sound of running feet.

2821
02:45:46,021 --> 02:45:49,170
The flashlights moved up and down.

2822
02:45:49,170 --> 02:45:53,351
And then a stick reached Tom's head, a blow
to the side of his face.

2823
02:45:53,351 --> 02:45:58,340
He fell to the ground but got up quickly and
ran.

2824
02:45:58,340 --> 02:46:04,710
He went low along the ground and hid in the
tall grass until footsteps went past him.

2825
02:46:04,710 --> 02:46:09,250
He got up again and found his way to the fence.

2826
02:46:09,250 --> 02:46:12,891
He walked silently to the door of the Joad
house.

2827
02:46:12,891 --> 02:46:15,790
The door made a noise as he opened it.

2828
02:46:15,790 --> 02:46:19,490
And Ma's voice said, "Who's that?"

2829
02:46:19,490 --> 02:46:21,250
"Me, Tom."

2830
02:46:21,250 --> 02:46:26,760
"Well, you'd better get some sleep."

2831
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:30,400
Tom did not sleep.

2832
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:37,040
His wounded face hurt, his broken nose ached
with pain.

2833
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:39,630
The dawn came finally.

2834
02:46:39,630 --> 02:46:43,920
Pa put on his old coat, yawning and stretching.

2835
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:46,230
Ma looked over at Tom.

2836
02:46:46,230 --> 02:46:48,720
"What's the matter?"

2837
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:49,971
she said.

2838
02:46:49,971 --> 02:46:52,040
"Sh," Tom said.

2839
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:54,561
"I got into a fight."

2840
02:46:54,561 --> 02:46:55,561
"Tom."

2841
02:46:55,561 --> 02:46:58,070
"I couldn't help it, Ma."

2842
02:46:58,070 --> 02:46:59,900
"What's the matter?"

2843
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:01,420
Uncle John asked.

2844
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:02,990
"What is this?"

2845
02:47:02,990 --> 02:47:04,160
Pa demanded.

2846
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:08,840
"I found the preacher last night," Tom said.

2847
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:10,260
"The preacher?"

2848
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:11,680
Pa asked.

2849
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:12,680
"Yeah.

2850
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:19,240
But he was leading a strike and they came
for him and they killed him.

2851
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:22,330
I was standing there and I went crazy.

2852
02:47:22,330 --> 02:47:25,160
I hit a guy"

2853
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:27,950
Ma's breath caught in her throat.

2854
02:47:27,950 --> 02:47:32,070
Pa said softly, "Did you kill him?"

2855
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:35,070
"I don't know," Tom said.

2856
02:47:35,070 --> 02:47:37,330
"I hope so."

2857
02:47:37,330 --> 02:47:38,390
"Tom!"

2858
02:47:38,390 --> 02:47:39,450
Ma said.

2859
02:47:39,450 --> 02:47:42,250
"Oh, you have to know.

2860
02:47:42,250 --> 02:47:46,240
Casy came out here with other fellows to get
five cents.

2861
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:49,880
But then they changed it to two and a half
cents."

2862
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:52,610
"A fellow can't eat on that."

2863
02:47:52,610 --> 02:47:56,190
"And then the pickers went on strike.

2864
02:47:56,190 --> 02:47:59,551
And now the cops killed Casy."

2865
02:47:59,551 --> 02:48:03,550
"Well, we need to get to work."

2866
02:48:03,550 --> 02:48:05,960
Ma looked sadly at Tom.

2867
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:08,510
"Rosasharn will stay with you.

2868
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:12,460
We'll tell them that you're sick today."

2869
02:48:12,460 --> 02:48:14,730
The family went to work.

2870
02:48:14,730 --> 02:48:17,630
Tom finally fell asleep.

2871
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:21,570
His sister watched him and the door.

2872
02:48:21,570 --> 02:48:27,620
As the sun began to set, Ma came back to the
house.

2873
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:33,540
She carefully built a fire in one end of the
stove and filled a pot with water and put

2874
02:48:33,540 --> 02:48:35,140
it over the flame.

2875
02:48:35,140 --> 02:48:37,920
"How was picking today?"

2876
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,420
Tom asked.

2877
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:42,760
Ma took a cup of dried corn pieces out of
a bag.

2878
02:48:42,760 --> 02:48:47,420
"I don't want to talk about it," she said.

2879
02:48:47,420 --> 02:48:51,910
Pa and Al and Uncle John and the children
came into the house.

2880
02:48:51,910 --> 02:48:57,640
Al looked at Ma and said, "Is that all we
get after working until dark?"

2881
02:48:57,640 --> 02:49:01,070
"Al, you know we have to go.

2882
02:49:01,070 --> 02:49:04,790
It will take all of the money we have for
gas."

2883
02:49:04,790 --> 02:49:09,230
"But, Ma, a fellow needs meat if he's going
to work."

2884
02:49:09,230 --> 02:49:11,780
"Just sit," she said.

2885
02:49:11,780 --> 02:49:17,290
They all sat down to their small dinners and
coffee.

2886
02:49:17,290 --> 02:49:21,421
Pa said, "They dropped the price like you
said, Tom.

2887
02:49:21,421 --> 02:49:24,040
Two and a half cents."

2888
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:28,920
Uncle John said, "They say there are two hundred
more men coming tonight."

2889
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:32,260
They were silent for a few minutes.

2890
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:38,030
Then Pa said, "Tom, it looks like you've done
it."

2891
02:49:38,030 --> 02:49:40,710
"I thought so."

2892
02:49:40,710 --> 02:49:45,190
Uncle John said, "They have men out there
looking for you.

2893
02:49:45,190 --> 02:49:48,460
They said that they're going to kill the man
who did it."

2894
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:51,851
"But I only did it after they killed Casy."

2895
02:49:51,851 --> 02:49:56,290
"They're saying you started it," Pa said.

2896
02:49:56,290 --> 02:49:59,370
Ma cried, "It ain't true!"

2897
02:49:59,370 --> 02:50:03,721
Tom said, "Ma, I have to go."

2898
02:50:03,721 --> 02:50:04,721
She got to her feet.

2899
02:50:04,721 --> 02:50:05,721
"You ain't going.

2900
02:50:05,721 --> 02:50:11,890
We can hide you, and we can bring you something
to eat while your face gets well.

2901
02:50:11,890 --> 02:50:14,110
We'll take you out of here.

2902
02:50:14,110 --> 02:50:17,160
Al, you back the truck against the door.

2903
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:21,820
We'll put the load in and hide Tom underneath
some blankets."

2904
02:50:21,820 --> 02:50:24,140
The family stared at her for a moment.

2905
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:27,010
"Come on, it's dark enough.

2906
02:50:27,010 --> 02:50:28,521
Let's go."

2907
02:50:28,521 --> 02:50:36,580
Al drove down the smaller country roads away
from the lines of police cars and men on strike.

2908
02:50:36,580 --> 02:50:41,700
At the edge of the road he saw a sign that
said Cotton Pickers Wanted.

2909
02:50:41,700 --> 02:50:43,800
He slowed the car.

2910
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:49,710
The family got out and Tom said, "I know a
way I can stay with you without getting you

2911
02:50:49,710 --> 02:50:50,880
into any trouble.

2912
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:56,480
There's a small stream just up the road with
lots of bushes around it.

2913
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:58,680
I can hide there."

2914
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:04,750
"And we can live in one of those boxcars over
there, where the pickers live," Ma added.

2915
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:09,521
"As soon as my face is well, I'll come out,"
Tom said.

2916
02:51:09,521 --> 02:51:13,041
"It seems like a good idea to me," said Pa.

2917
02:51:13,041 --> 02:51:14,041
CHAPTER NINE

2918
02:51:14,041 --> 02:51:15,041
The Cotton Camps

2919
02:51:15,041 --> 02:51:20,610
Cotton Pickers Wanted said the signs along
the road.

2920
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:22,521
People appeared, ready to work.

2921
02:51:22,521 --> 02:51:27,140
They picked the cotton and put it into large
bags.

2922
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:31,290
If they did not have a bag, they had to buy
one for a dollar.

2923
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:34,880
When a bag broke, they sewed up the open end.

2924
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:38,970
When both ends broke, they used the cloth
to make clothes.

2925
02:51:38,970 --> 02:51:42,990
The bags full of cotton were weighed.

2926
02:51:42,990 --> 02:51:47,530
Sometimes, the scales cheated the cotton pickers
of money.

2927
02:51:47,530 --> 02:51:52,510
Sometimes, the cotton pickers put rocks in
the bags to make them heavier.

2928
02:51:52,510 --> 02:51:58,521
The cotton pickers and the scale man always
argued, always fought.

2929
02:51:58,521 --> 02:52:04,800
The cars moved into the cotton fields and
the cotton camps were set up.

2930
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:11,260
The boxcars, twelve of them, stood end to
end on a little flat area near the stream.

2931
02:52:11,260 --> 02:52:15,490
They had large sliding doors but no windows.

2932
02:52:15,490 --> 02:52:23,340
The Joads shared an end car with the Wainwrights,
so Ma hung a large blanket across the middle

2933
02:52:23,340 --> 02:52:24,740
of the boxcar.

2934
02:52:24,740 --> 02:52:29,421
The cotton pickers worked quickly until dark
each day.

2935
02:52:29,421 --> 02:52:33,320
They knew the work would soon end.

2936
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:38,650
Ma came into the boxcar carrying a large bag
full of food.

2937
02:52:38,650 --> 02:52:40,910
Rosasharn sat on a box beside the stove.

2938
02:52:40,910 --> 02:52:42,970
"Did you get milk?"

2939
02:52:42,970 --> 02:52:44,540
the girl demanded.

2940
02:52:44,540 --> 02:52:48,320
"Yeah, right here," Ma said.

2941
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:50,870
"Are the potatoes ready?"

2942
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:51,870
"Yeah, Ma."

2943
02:52:51,870 --> 02:52:57,601
"Well, we're going to have pork tonight,"
Ma said with a smile on her face.

2944
02:52:57,601 --> 02:53:00,860
Uncle John and Pa and Al came in.

2945
02:53:00,860 --> 02:53:03,280
Winfield followed behind.

2946
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:05,440
"Ma," Winfield said.

2947
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:07,230
"Ma, Ruthie told."

2948
02:53:07,230 --> 02:53:09,710
"Told what."

2949
02:53:09,710 --> 02:53:12,181
"About Tom."

2950
02:53:12,181 --> 02:53:14,080
Ma stared at Winfield.

2951
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:16,021
"What did she say?"

2952
02:53:16,021 --> 02:53:18,170
"She only told a little.

2953
02:53:18,170 --> 02:53:23,930
A big girl took her candy and Ruthie tried
to get it back and they got into a fight.

2954
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:27,690
And the big girl said that she was going to
get her big brother.

2955
02:53:27,690 --> 02:53:33,450
And Ruthie said she was going to get her big
brother who was hiding because he killed a

2956
02:53:33,450 --> 02:53:34,450
man."

2957
02:53:34,450 --> 02:53:35,450
"Oh!"

2958
02:53:35,450 --> 02:53:36,450
Ma said.

2959
02:53:36,450 --> 02:53:37,450
"Oh!

2960
02:53:37,450 --> 02:53:38,631
Dear God."

2961
02:53:38,631 --> 02:53:42,551
She looked at Winfield and said, "You go get
Ruthie.

2962
02:53:42,551 --> 02:53:49,291
Pa, you stay here, and I'll take Tom some
food and tell him what's happened."

2963
02:53:49,291 --> 02:53:53,061
"All right," Pa agreed.

2964
02:53:53,061 --> 02:53:58,090
Ma quickly put some food in a bowl and covered
it with a towel.

2965
02:53:58,090 --> 02:54:04,051
She stepped out of the boxcar and moved proudly
down the line of tents and cars.

2966
02:54:04,051 --> 02:54:09,630
She stepped in among the tall grass and bushes
along the stream until she found the cave

2967
02:54:09,630 --> 02:54:11,920
where Tom was hiding.

2968
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:14,101
"Tom," she called.

2969
02:54:14,101 --> 02:54:16,980
"Is that you, Ma?"

2970
02:54:16,980 --> 02:54:19,351
"Yeah, right over here.

2971
02:54:19,351 --> 02:54:21,900
I have to talk to you, Tom."

2972
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:26,290
"You have to come in so no one sees you."

2973
02:54:26,290 --> 02:54:28,950
She lowered her head and went into the cave.

2974
02:54:28,950 --> 02:54:33,470
It was dark and she could not see Tom's face.

2975
02:54:33,470 --> 02:54:36,250
But she knew that he was near.

2976
02:54:36,250 --> 02:54:41,340
She placed the food down and soon she could
hear him chewing.

2977
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:44,830
"Ruthie told about you, Tom."

2978
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:45,830
"What?

2979
02:54:45,830 --> 02:54:48,730
Why did she do that?"

2980
02:54:48,730 --> 02:54:51,910
"Well, it wasn't her fault.

2981
02:54:51,910 --> 02:54:55,480
Some kids were fighting and it came out."

2982
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:58,540
Then Ma was silent.

2983
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:02,730
She finally said, "You have to go, Tom.

2984
02:55:02,730 --> 02:55:05,261
I don't want you to."

2985
02:55:05,261 --> 02:55:07,490
"I know, Ma."

2986
02:55:07,490 --> 02:55:10,181
"How's your face?"

2987
02:55:10,181 --> 02:55:14,900
She reached out into the darkness and felt
his head and face.

2988
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:19,420
"You have a bad wound and your nose is all
bent."

2989
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:22,620
"Maybe that's a good thing.

2990
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:24,480
No one will know me."

2991
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:28,450
"Tom, I have some money for you.

2992
02:55:28,450 --> 02:55:29,490
Seven dollars.

2993
02:55:29,490 --> 02:55:30,811
It ain't much.

2994
02:55:30,811 --> 02:55:34,950
But you can take a bus far away from here."

2995
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:36,650
"Oh, Ma.

2996
02:55:36,650 --> 02:55:37,950
You need that money."

2997
02:55:37,950 --> 02:55:40,940
"Now, you just take it."

2998
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:43,970
"OK," he said.

2999
02:55:43,970 --> 02:55:47,521
He then ate the rest of the food.

3000
02:55:47,521 --> 02:55:50,490
Ma said, "What are you going to do?"

3001
02:55:50,490 --> 02:55:53,930
"What Casy did," he said.

3002
02:55:53,930 --> 02:55:56,811
"But they killed him."

3003
02:55:56,811 --> 02:55:58,250
"Yeah," said Tom.

3004
02:55:58,250 --> 02:56:00,290
"He didn't run quick enough.

3005
02:56:00,290 --> 02:56:04,030
He wasn't doing anything against the law.

3006
02:56:04,030 --> 02:56:10,391
And all of these people are working hard and
living like animals."

3007
02:56:10,391 --> 02:56:13,390
She put the money in Tom's hand.

3008
02:56:13,390 --> 02:56:16,150
"Goodbye," she said.

3009
02:56:16,150 --> 02:56:18,290
She walked away quickly.

3010
02:56:18,290 --> 02:56:23,200
"Goodbye," Tom said softly.

3011
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:28,250
When Ma returned to the boxcar, Pa and Uncle
John were sitting outside.

3012
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:33,771
Ma said, "I found Tom, and I sent him away."

3013
02:56:33,771 --> 02:56:36,730
Pa sadly looked away.

3014
02:56:36,730 --> 02:56:39,960
Uncle John dropped his chin on his chest.

3015
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:45,521
Then Pa said, "The cotton's nearly gone."

3016
02:56:45,521 --> 02:56:47,840
Al stepped out from the boxcar.

3017
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:51,120
Ma said, "We'll have to move along."

3018
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:54,740
"I'll have to go soon," Al said.

3019
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:56,490
"You can't," Ma said.

3020
02:56:56,490 --> 02:56:58,140
"We need you."

3021
02:56:58,140 --> 02:57:03,601
"Well, Aggie Wainwright and me are going to
get married and I'm going to get a job in

3022
02:57:03,601 --> 02:57:05,230
a garage and rent a house.

3023
02:57:05,230 --> 02:57:08,300
And nobody can stop us."

3024
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:12,061
Pa and Uncle John and Ma stared at him.

3025
02:57:12,061 --> 02:57:15,530
"Al," Ma said at last.

3026
02:57:15,530 --> 02:57:17,341
"We're glad.

3027
02:57:17,341 --> 02:57:20,061
We're very glad."

3028
02:57:20,061 --> 02:57:21,860
"You are?"

3029
02:57:21,860 --> 02:57:24,480
"Well, you're grown up.

3030
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:27,000
And a man needs a wife.

3031
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,400
But don't go now, Al.

3032
02:57:29,400 --> 02:57:31,931
Stay until spring."

3033
02:57:31,931 --> 02:57:35,320
Mrs. Wainwright's head appeared from the boxcar.

3034
02:57:35,320 --> 02:57:37,910
"Have you heard the news?"

3035
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:38,910
"Yeah.

3036
02:57:38,910 --> 02:57:40,300
Just heard," Ma said.

3037
02:57:40,300 --> 02:57:42,880
"Well, let's have a little party!"

3038
02:57:42,880 --> 02:57:46,820
Rosasharn came to the door of the boxcar.

3039
02:57:46,820 --> 02:57:48,410
"What's the matter?"

3040
02:57:48,410 --> 02:57:50,000
"It's good news!"

3041
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Ma said.

3042
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,811
"Al and Aggie are getting married.

3043
02:57:53,811 --> 02:57:56,740
And we're going to have a little party."

3044
02:57:56,740 --> 02:58:02,141
The next day, the rain started.

3045
02:58:02,141 --> 02:58:05,140
The roads were shiny with water.

3046
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:08,021
The rain fell steadily.

3047
02:58:08,021 --> 02:58:12,601
Hour by hour the cotton plants seemed to blacken
and die.

3048
02:58:12,601 --> 02:58:14,980
The evening came early.

3049
02:58:14,980 --> 02:58:17,460
The rain continued.

3050
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:24,990
In the boxcars the families stayed close together,
listening to the pouring water on the roofs.

3051
02:58:24,990 --> 02:58:32,820
The families knew that this meant no more
cotton, no work until spring - no money, no

3052
02:58:32,820 --> 02:58:33,820
food.

3053
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:41,230
Then pools of water formed and in the low
places little lakes formed in the fields.

3054
02:58:41,230 --> 02:58:44,150
The muddy lakes rose higher.

3055
02:58:44,150 --> 02:58:50,450
At last, the mountains were full and the hillsides
spilled into the streams.

3056
02:58:50,450 --> 02:58:55,141
On the third day of the rain, the sound of
the stream could be heard above the drumming

3057
02:58:55,141 --> 02:58:56,141
rain.

3058
02:58:56,141 --> 02:59:02,801
Pa and Uncle John stood in the open door and
looked out over the rising stream.

3059
02:59:02,801 --> 02:59:07,771
Uncle John said, "Some fellows are talking
about moving somewhere else."

3060
02:59:07,771 --> 02:59:11,450
"But these cars are dry," Pa said.

3061
02:59:11,450 --> 02:59:14,840
"You can't find as dry a place as these cars.

3062
02:59:14,840 --> 02:59:15,980
You wait."

3063
02:59:15,980 --> 02:59:17,900
He looked down at the water again.

3064
02:59:17,900 --> 02:59:19,800
"It's coming up fast.

3065
02:59:19,800 --> 02:59:25,521
Maybe those other fellows will want to dig
an area for the water to go into and a wall

3066
02:59:25,521 --> 02:59:28,380
to stop it coming over here."

3067
02:59:28,380 --> 02:59:33,601
Ma's voice called out, "Mrs.Wainwright, Mrs.
Wainwright!"

3068
02:59:33,601 --> 02:59:35,730
The fat little woman came down the car.

3069
02:59:35,730 --> 02:59:37,820
"Do you want me?"

3070
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:40,370
Ma pointed to Rosasharn's face.

3071
02:59:40,370 --> 02:59:41,370
"Look."

3072
02:59:41,370 --> 02:59:45,880
The girl's forehead was wet and fear filled
her eyes.

3073
02:59:45,880 --> 02:59:48,890
"I think it's coming.

3074
02:59:48,890 --> 02:59:50,399
It's early."

3075
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:54,101
Mrs. Wainwright bent over the girl and looked
at her carefully.

3076
02:59:54,101 --> 02:59:57,601
"It will be all right."

3077
02:59:57,601 --> 02:59:58,880
Ma said, "Ruthie!

3078
02:59:58,880 --> 03:00:02,101
You and Winfield go outside with Aggie.

3079
03:00:02,101 --> 03:00:04,160
Go on now."

3080
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:05,160
"Why?"

3081
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:06,230
they demanded.

3082
03:00:06,230 --> 03:00:10,170
"Because Rosasharn is going to have her baby.

3083
03:00:10,170 --> 03:00:11,290
Now go."

3084
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:14,400
Rosasharn said nervously, "Is it coming?"

3085
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:16,311
"Sure," Ma said.

3086
03:00:16,311 --> 03:00:19,230
"You're going to have a nice baby."

3087
03:00:19,230 --> 03:00:24,230
"We'll help you, honey," Mrs. Wainwright said.

3088
03:00:24,230 --> 03:00:28,070
Pa put his head in through the narrow opening
of the door.

3089
03:00:28,070 --> 03:00:30,570
"Why did you shut the door?"

3090
03:00:30,570 --> 03:00:33,601
Ma said, "Her time's come."

3091
03:00:33,601 --> 03:00:35,990
"Then, we have to build that wall.

3092
03:00:35,990 --> 03:00:38,370
We couldn't go if we wanted to."

3093
03:00:38,370 --> 03:00:39,370
"No.

3094
03:00:39,370 --> 03:00:41,521
We can't go now."

3095
03:00:41,521 --> 03:00:45,000
Pa ran outside, stepping heavily through the
mud.

3096
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,820
"We have to build the wall.

3097
03:00:47,820 --> 03:00:49,200
We can't go now.

3098
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:53,110
My girl is having a baby."

3099
03:00:53,110 --> 03:00:58,351
Twenty men helped build the wall, digging
the mud with shovels and buckets.

3100
03:00:58,351 --> 03:01:01,261
They worked quickly, like machines.

3101
03:01:01,261 --> 03:01:07,120
When one man dropped his shovel, another man
picked it up and continued shoveling.

3102
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:09,090
They took off their coats and hats.

3103
03:01:09,090 --> 03:01:13,400
Their clothes and shoes were covered in mud.

3104
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:16,660
A scream came from the Joad car.

3105
03:01:16,660 --> 03:01:22,181
The men stopped and listened anxiously and
then went back to work.

3106
03:01:22,181 --> 03:01:25,490
The water rose slowly up the side of the new
wall.

3107
03:01:25,490 --> 03:01:26,490
"Higher!"

3108
03:01:26,490 --> 03:01:27,490
Pa cried.

3109
03:01:27,490 --> 03:01:29,480
"We have to get it higher!"

3110
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:32,631
The evening came and the work went on.

3111
03:01:32,631 --> 03:01:36,870
And now the men were almost too tired to stand.

3112
03:01:36,870 --> 03:01:40,380
From time to time Pa looked in the car door.

3113
03:01:40,380 --> 03:01:42,780
"All right?" he asked.

3114
03:01:42,780 --> 03:01:43,780
"Yeah!

3115
03:01:43,780 --> 03:01:47,080
I think so," Ma said.

3116
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:50,101
The stream was suddenly growing more quickly.

3117
03:01:50,101 --> 03:01:53,380
Then, from up the stream came a loud crash.

3118
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:58,950
A large tree had fallen into the stream and
was coming down toward the wall.

3119
03:01:58,950 --> 03:02:03,690
The tired men watched, their mouths hanging
open.

3120
03:02:03,690 --> 03:02:06,900
The tree pushed and broke the wall.

3121
03:02:06,900 --> 03:02:13,300
The broken wall washed quickly down, washed
around ankles, around knees.

3122
03:02:13,300 --> 03:02:14,400
The men turned and ran.

3123
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:19,311
"Come on, the cars are high," Pa cried.

3124
03:02:19,311 --> 03:02:23,180
They ran back to the boxcars.

3125
03:02:23,180 --> 03:02:27,601
Some of the men hurried into their vehicles
and drove off through the mud.

3126
03:02:27,601 --> 03:02:31,910
Pa carefully squeezed through the narrow door
opening.

3127
03:02:31,910 --> 03:02:34,400
The two lamps were turned low.

3128
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:38,301
Ruthie and Winfield were asleep in the corner.

3129
03:02:38,301 --> 03:02:41,681
Ma sat on the bed beside Rosasharn.

3130
03:02:41,681 --> 03:02:45,771
Ma looked up when Pa entered, and then quickly
down.

3131
03:02:45,771 --> 03:02:48,170
"How is she?"

3132
03:02:48,170 --> 03:02:49,779
Pa asked.

3133
03:02:49,779 --> 03:02:51,680
Ma did not look up again.

3134
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:55,400
"All right, I think.

3135
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:56,400
Sleeping."

3136
03:02:56,400 --> 03:03:00,220
"Never breathed," said Mrs. Wainwright softly.

3137
03:03:00,220 --> 03:03:04,061
"Never was alive."

3138
03:03:04,061 --> 03:03:08,180
Pa said weakly, "We did what we could."

3139
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:11,011
"I know," Ma said.

3140
03:03:11,011 --> 03:03:13,480
"We worked all night.

3141
03:03:13,480 --> 03:03:16,400
And a tree cut through the wall."

3142
03:03:16,400 --> 03:03:19,150
"I know," she said.

3143
03:03:19,150 --> 03:03:23,160
"I don't know how high the stream's going
to rise.

3144
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:24,950
It might flood the boxcar.

3145
03:03:24,950 --> 03:03:27,940
Maybe we'll have to go."

3146
03:03:27,940 --> 03:03:30,450
Ruthie moved her hand over her eyes.

3147
03:03:30,450 --> 03:03:32,400
"Where's the baby?"

3148
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:34,040
she demanded.

3149
03:03:34,040 --> 03:03:35,771
Ma wet her lips.

3150
03:03:35,771 --> 03:03:37,811
"There ain't any baby.

3151
03:03:37,811 --> 03:03:40,511
There never was a baby.

3152
03:03:40,511 --> 03:03:41,811
We were wrong.

3153
03:03:41,811 --> 03:03:43,431
Now go back to sleep."

3154
03:03:43,431 --> 03:03:54,930
Pa and Al and Uncle John sat in the boxcar
doorway and watched the dawn come up.

3155
03:03:54,930 --> 03:03:56,391
The rain had stopped.

3156
03:03:56,391 --> 03:03:59,511
But the water was still climbing slowly.

3157
03:03:59,511 --> 03:04:03,130
"Do you think it will come in the boxcar?"

3158
03:04:03,130 --> 03:04:04,171
Al asked.

3159
03:04:04,171 --> 03:04:05,740
"I don't know."

3160
03:04:05,740 --> 03:04:08,881
"Well, I've been thinking.

3161
03:04:08,881 --> 03:04:13,190
We can take down the sideboards of the truck
and build a platform.

3162
03:04:13,190 --> 03:04:18,421
That way we can pile our stuff up and maybe
it will stay dry until the water level goes

3163
03:04:18,421 --> 03:04:19,711
back down.

3164
03:04:19,711 --> 03:04:25,101
And we can go across to the other side of
the highway, away from the stream water, on

3165
03:04:25,101 --> 03:04:26,101
higher ground."

3166
03:04:26,101 --> 03:04:29,521
Pa thought for a minute.

3167
03:04:29,521 --> 03:04:30,900
"Yeah.

3168
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:32,860
We need to do that.

3169
03:04:32,860 --> 03:04:34,641
We can't stay here."

3170
03:04:34,641 --> 03:04:38,220
"I'll get started," Al said.

3171
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:41,430
The rain began again.

3172
03:04:41,430 --> 03:04:45,280
Ma built a little fire with the last of the
dry sticks.

3173
03:04:45,280 --> 03:04:51,550
The family sat around and ate the last of
their food, boiled potatoes.

3174
03:04:51,550 --> 03:04:54,801
Finally Pa said, "It's time to go."

3175
03:04:54,801 --> 03:04:57,261
Al said, "I can't.

3176
03:04:57,261 --> 03:04:58,261
Aggie.

3177
03:04:58,261 --> 03:04:59,990
She and I ..."

3178
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:02,960
"Of course," Ma said.

3179
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:05,440
"You stay here, Al.

3180
03:05:05,440 --> 03:05:07,530
Take care of our stuff.

3181
03:05:07,530 --> 03:05:10,200
When the water goes down, we'll come back.

3182
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:13,840
Come on, Rosasharn, children.

3183
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:16,650
We're going to a dry place."

3184
03:05:16,650 --> 03:05:23,290
Pa and Uncle John hurried out first and stood
in the water waiting.

3185
03:05:23,290 --> 03:05:28,040
They helped Rosasharn, sad and weak.

3186
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:31,680
Pa held Rosasharn as high as he could.

3187
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:36,980
Uncle John carried Ruthie while Winfield rode
on his shoulders.

3188
03:05:36,980 --> 03:05:42,410
Together they walked slowly to the highway,
where the children got down.

3189
03:05:42,410 --> 03:05:46,580
Ma searched the land and flooded fields with
her eyes.

3190
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:49,080
Then she saw an old barn.

3191
03:05:49,080 --> 03:05:52,620
"Come on," she called to her family.

3192
03:05:52,620 --> 03:05:53,820
"This way."

3193
03:05:53,820 --> 03:05:56,320
The rain became heavier.

3194
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:59,670
"Hurry up, Ruthie, Winfield.

3195
03:05:59,670 --> 03:06:01,340
Run ahead."

3196
03:06:01,340 --> 03:06:04,400
They entered the old barn.

3197
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:06,561
It was dark inside.

3198
03:06:06,561 --> 03:06:11,430
A little light came in through the cracks
in the old boards.

3199
03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:14,080
Winfield said, "Look!

3200
03:06:14,080 --> 03:06:16,681
In the corner."

3201
03:06:16,681 --> 03:06:17,681
Ma looked.

3202
03:06:17,681 --> 03:06:25,790
There were two figures, a man who lay on his
back, and a boy sitting beside him.

3203
03:06:25,790 --> 03:06:31,740
The boy looked at them and said, "Do you own
this place?"

3204
03:06:31,740 --> 03:06:33,271
"No," Ma said.

3205
03:06:33,271 --> 03:06:36,561
"We've just come in from the rain.

3206
03:06:36,561 --> 03:06:39,181
We have a sick girl."

3207
03:06:39,181 --> 03:06:40,630
Ma looked at the man.

3208
03:06:40,630 --> 03:06:43,220
"What's the matter with him?"

3209
03:06:43,220 --> 03:06:46,340
"He got sick in the cotton.

3210
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:49,220
Hasn't eaten in six days.

3211
03:06:49,220 --> 03:06:53,030
Said he wasn't hungry or he just ate.

3212
03:06:53,030 --> 03:06:54,190
Gave me the food.

3213
03:06:54,190 --> 03:06:57,561
Now he's too weak to move."

3214
03:06:57,561 --> 03:06:59,891
"Is he your pa?"

3215
03:06:59,891 --> 03:07:01,950
Ma asked.

3216
03:07:01,950 --> 03:07:04,620
"Yeah," the boy said.

3217
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:07,110
He started to cry.

3218
03:07:07,110 --> 03:07:09,000
"He's dying.

3219
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:13,980
Last night I went and stole some bread but
he couldn't eat it.

3220
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:17,400
Got to have soup or milk.

3221
03:07:17,400 --> 03:07:21,180
Do you folks have money for milk?"

3222
03:07:21,180 --> 03:07:23,841
Ma said, "Don't worry.

3223
03:07:23,841 --> 03:07:27,490
We'll think of something."

3224
03:07:27,490 --> 03:07:32,320
She looked at Pa and Uncle John watching the
sick man.

3225
03:07:32,320 --> 03:07:38,720
She looked at Rosasharn, now sitting on the
floor with a blanket wrapped around her.

3226
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:42,922
Ma's eyes passed Rosasharn's eyes and then
came back to them.

3227
03:07:42,922 --> 03:07:49,230
And the two women looked deep into each other.

3228
03:07:49,230 --> 03:07:53,250
The girl said, "Yes."

3229
03:07:53,250 --> 03:07:54,470
Ma smiled.

3230
03:07:54,470 --> 03:07:59,510
"I knew you would," she said.

3231
03:07:59,510 --> 03:08:06,300
Rosasharn whispered, "Will - will you all
go out?"

3232
03:08:06,300 --> 03:08:12,461
Ma reached out and brushed the hair from her
daughter's forehead and then kissed her.

3233
03:08:12,461 --> 03:08:18,301
She said to the others, "Come on, let's go
outside for a few minutes."

3234
03:08:18,301 --> 03:08:22,771
She took the boy's arm and stepped outside
the barn.

3235
03:08:22,771 --> 03:08:29,380
Uncle John, Pa, and the children followed
her.

3236
03:08:29,380 --> 03:08:33,170
For a minute, Rosasharn sat quietly.

3237
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:40,110
Then, she raised her tired body and went over
to the dying man.

3238
03:08:40,110 --> 03:08:46,490
She stood looking down at the thin face, into
the wide frightened eyes.

3239
03:08:46,490 --> 03:08:50,950
Then, slowly she lay down beside him.

3240
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:55,980
He shook his head slowly from side to side.

3241
03:08:55,980 --> 03:09:00,670
Rosasharn loosened one side of the blanket
and let out her breast.

3242
03:09:00,670 --> 03:09:06,580
"You have to," she said and pulled his head
close.

3243
03:09:06,580 --> 03:09:08,101
"There!"

3244
03:09:08,101 --> 03:09:09,490
she said.

3245
03:09:09,490 --> 03:09:10,820
"There."

3246
03:09:10,820 --> 03:09:16,461
Her hand moved behind his head and supported
it.

3247
03:09:16,461 --> 03:09:20,771
Her fingers moved gently in his hair.

3248
03:09:20,771 --> 03:09:26,391
She looked up and across the barn and smiled
mysteriously.
