00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,480
The Damned Thing

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,960
It was night.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Eight men were sitting together 
in an empty room of a small house.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,240
The only pieces of furniture were a 
simple wooden table and eight chairs.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,400
The only light came from a lamp on the table.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
One of the men was reading a book.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,560
He held the book close to the lamp, so 
that he could see the words on the pages.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
There was a ninth man in the room.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,960
He owned the house.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,920
He was lying on the table, beneath a white sheet.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
The ninth man was dead.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
It was quiet in the house.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,160
Outside, there were the sounds of birds 
and insects in the trees around the house.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
Visitors from the city always noticed 
these strange cries and calls.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,400
But the men in the room took 
no notice of these sounds.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
They heard them every day.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
Seven of the men were farmers and woodsmen.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
They worked in the fields and 
forests every day of the year.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,400
The skin on their faces had been 
burned by the sun and the wind.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
They were wearing hats with broad brims.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,480
The man with the book did 
not look like the others.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
He was not wearing a broad-brimmed hat.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,480
His face was smooth, intelligent and handsome.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,720
He looked like an educated, important man.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,760
He was a coroner.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,320
All of the men were here this 
evening to do an important job.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
An inquest was taking place in the room.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,840
The men had come to look at 
the dead body on the table.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,320
They had to answer this 
question: How did this man die?

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
The coroner was reading a diary.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
It belonged to the dead man.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,080
The coroner and the seven men were waiting for 
a witness to attend the dead man's inquest.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
Suddenly, they heard the sound 
of a horse galloping on the road.

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,480
Someone was riding quickly toward the house.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
The horse stopped outside, the door 
opened and a young man came in.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
"I'm late.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
I'm sorry," he said.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,840
"We've been waiting for you," said the coroner.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
"We must finish this job tonight.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,080
Hugh Morgan must be buried tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Where have you been?"

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,160
"I went to the telegraph office and 
sent a telegram," said the young man.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,160
"I've written a report about Hugh Morgan's death.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
The report will be in the San 
Francisco newspapers tomorrow.

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm a reporter.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,960
I write stories for the newspapers."

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,640
"You're not here to tell us a 
newspaper story," said the coroner.

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,800
"You're here to tell us 
what happened to Mr Morgan.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,520
You must tell the truth.

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
You must swear that you'll do this."

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,200
"Yes.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,960
I'll tell you the truth," said the young man.

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,240
"Rut you might not believe me."

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,160
"That isn't a good beginning," said the coroner.

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
"Is your newspaper report different from 
the story that you're going to tell us?"

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,840
For a moment, the young man had 
an angry expression on his face.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,120
"I've come here to tell you 
what really happened," he said.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,480
"I promise that I'll tell you the truth.

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
Everything that I say to you will be true.

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,560
You can read what I wrote for the newspaper.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,000
These are the true facts.

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
This is what I saw and heard and did.

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
The report isn't fiction."

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
"Let's begin," said the coroner.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
The men took off their hats.

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
The young man lifted his right hand 
and began to speak slowly and clearly.

67
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
"I swear before God.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,840
I will tell the truth, the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth," he said.

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,200
"What is your name?" asked the coroner.

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
"William Harker."

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,280
"Age?"

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,280
"Twenty-seven."

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
"Did you know the dead man, Hugh Morgan?"

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
"Yes, I did."

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
"Were you with him when he died?"

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
"I was near him."

77
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,280
"Tell us what happened," said the coroner.

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,320
"Why were you with Mr Morgan, 
and what did you see?"

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,600
"I was visiting him," said Harker.

80
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
"Morgan and I were good friends.

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,280
I live in San Francisco, but I 
often came here to stay with Morgan.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,000
We hunted birds and animals in the 
forest, and we caught fish in the rivers.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,440
Morgan and I went hunting and 
fishing together many times."

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,840
"Tell us what happened on the day that 
Mr Morgan died," said the coroner.

85
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,360
"We left this house at sunrise," said Harker.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
"We wanted to hunt quails.

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
We took Morgan's dog with us 
and we both carried shotguns.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,800
Morgan told me, 'There's a field 
of wild oats over the hill.

89
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,640
There are many good, large quails there.

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
They'll be good to eat.'

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,320
So we went to the field.

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
But we found something bigger than quails."

93
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,000
"What do you mean?" asked the coroner.

94
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,000
"Did you find an animal?"

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
"Yes-er-no," said Harker.

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
"I don't know what kind of animal it was.

97
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,320
But I saw the oats moving in the field.

98
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,000
Something was coming toward us.

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,320
I couldn't see the animal, 
but I guessed that it was big.

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,680
Morgan didn't say anything.

101
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
He lifted his gun and aimed it at the oats."

102
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,160
Harker stopped speaking and 
looked toward the window.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,840
"Please continue, Mr Harker," said the coroner.

104
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
"What happened next?"

105
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,560
"I pointed at the moving plants," replied Harker.

106
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,920
"I said, 'Morgan! If that's a deer, you 
won't be able to kill it with a shotgun.

107
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,800
You'll need a more powerful gun-a rifle.

108
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,960
But maybe it's something bigger than a deer.

109
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,120
It might be a bear, or a mountain 
lion!' But Morgan didn't reply.

110
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,240
He just aimed his gun at the oats and stared.

111
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,840
I began to be afraid.

112
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,440
Our shotguns wouldn't stop 
an angry bear or a lion."

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,840
"Mr Harker, you say that it was 
a big animal," said the coroner.

114
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,880
"Do you know the difference between 
a bear and a lion and a deer?"

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
"Yes, I do, sir," said the 
young man quickly and angrily.

116
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,480
"And that's the strangest part of this story.

117
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,160
I saw the oats moving.

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,840
And I heard something coming through the plants.

119
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,840
But I couldn't see what it was.

120
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,680
A big thing was moving toward 
us, but I couldn't see it."

121
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,080
"Did you speak to Mr Morgan 
again?" asked the coroner.

122
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,200
"Yes," said Harker.

123
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,640
"I shouted, 'What is it?' But Morgan didn't reply.

124
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,960
The animal-or thing-was coming closer 
and Morgan got ready to fire his gun.

125
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,000
Suddenly he said, 'It's that 
Damned Thing!' He was terrified."

126
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,640
"Did Mr Morgan know what 
it was?" asked the coroner.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
"Is that what you believe, Mr Harker?"

128
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
"Yes, sir," Harker replied.

129
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
"I believe that Morgan had seen it before.

130
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,080
Then he fired his gun and 
I heard a terrible sound.

131
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,840
It was the scream of a wild animal."

132
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,480
"And did you fire your gun 
too?" asked the coroner.

133
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
"No, I didn't.

134
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
I couldn't," replied Harker.

135
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
"The smoke from Morgan's gun was in my eyes.

136
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
I couldn't see where to aim my own gun.

137
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,200
Then, suddenly, Morgan dropped 
his gun and started to run."

138
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
"He left you ?" asked the coroner.

139
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,040
"Well, I was surprised," said Harker.

140
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,080
"But I didn't have time to think about it.

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Something knocked me to the ground."

142
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,760
"What knocked you down?" asked the coroner.

143
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
"Well, I didn't see it.

144
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,040
But it was soft and heavy.

145
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,840
It moved very fast."

146
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
"And then what happened?"

147
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
"I heard wild screams near me.

148
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,920
They were like the sounds 
made by dogs who are fighting.

149
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
Then I saw that Morgan was fighting.

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
He was on the ground.

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
He was fighting for his life."

152
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,840
"Fighting what?" asked the coroner.

153
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,040
"I-I don't know," said the young man.

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
"I couldn't see anything, or anyone.

155
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,720
But Morgan was on the ground and there was 
a strange movement in the air around him.

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know how to describe it.

157
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,880
It seemed as if the fight 
was happening under water.

158
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
Sometimes I couldn't see one of Morgan's hands.

159
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
Sometimes his head disappeared.

160
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,040
Then his whole body moved again."

161
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,160
"And did you try to help Mr 
Morgan?" asked the coroner.

162
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
"Of course I did.

163
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,640
I ran toward him.

164
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,720
But I found him like this..." Harker 
pointed to the dead body on the table.

165
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
"And where was the animal?" asked the coroner.

166
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,640
"I don't know.

167
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,640
I only saw the oats moving again.

168
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,440
They moved as if there was 
wind blowing across them.

169
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,840
The thing- whatever it was-went into the woods.

170
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,240
My friend was dead.

171
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
I came into town to get a police officer."

172
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,080
"Very well," said the coroner, 
"we'll examine the body."

173
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,200
He lifted the white sheet off Morgan's body.

174
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,640
Then he removed a handkerchief that 
was tied around the dead man's head.

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,880
The handkerchief kept Morgan's mouth closed.

176
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
The other men looked closely.

177
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
One of them held the lamp high.

178
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
Its light shone on the body of the dead man.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,840
Hugh Morgan's throat had been torn open.

180
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,840
There were many terrible deep 
injuries all over his body.

181
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,200
His clothes were soaked with blood.

182
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,520
"Gentlemen, you've heard Mr 
Harker's story," said the coroner.

183
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,640
"You've seen Mr Morgan's body.

184
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,480
What shall we write on the death certificate?  

185
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,960
Did a wild animal kill Mr Morgan, 
or was he murdered? We must decide."

186
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,920
The seven men went out of the room and spoke 
together quietly for two or three minutes.

187
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,080
William Harker turned toward the coroner.

188
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,360
"I see that you have Morgan's 
diary, sir," he said.

189
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,840
"Have you read it? Does it 
tell us anything important?"

190
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,960
"I've read it quickly," said the coroner,  

191
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,960
"No, it doesn't tell us anything 
about the cause of Mr Morgan's death."

192
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,000
The seven men came back into the room.

193
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,000
One of them stood in front 
of the coroner and spoke.

194
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,320
"We believe that Hugh Morgan was 
killed by a mountain lion," he said.

195
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,960
"Thank you, gentlemen," said the coroner.

196
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,360
"Everyone can leave now.

197
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,120
Mr Morgan will be buried in the morning.

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,840
I'll send for an undertaker."

199
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,200
That was the end of the inquest.

200
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
But it was not quite the end of the story.

201
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,840
William Harker was a writer.

202
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,400
He wanted to read Hugh Morgan's diary and 
write a story about his friend's death.

203
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,960
He stayed in the town after Morgan was buried.

204
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,640
A few days later, Morgan's 
property and belongings were sold.

205
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
William Harker bought the diary.

206
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Hugh Morgan had been a lonely man who had 
written all his thoughts in his diary.

207
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,640
But he had not always written 
days and dates in the diary.

208
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,920
And some of the pages in the book were torn.

209
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,400
Other pages were missing.

210
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,520
This is what Morgan had written before his death:

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,640
My dog is behaving strangely.

212
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
He barks and turns around again and again.

213
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
He looks at something that isn't there.

214
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,560
He runs after something that he can't see.

215
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
This has happened several times.

216
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
1 September

217
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,560
Tonight, I was looking at the 
stars in the sky above the hill.

218
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,560
Then something strange happened.

219
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,640
Someone-or something-moved 
between me and the stars.

220
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,360
The stars suddenly looked like a pool 
when you drop a stone in the water.

221
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,480
Am I going crazy?

222
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,160
27 September

223
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,680
It's been here again.

224
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
It moves around the house.

225
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,440
Now I keep my gun beside me always.

226
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,840
Does this Thing only come at night?

227
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,080
Today I saw footprints in the 
soft ground, near the house.

228
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
What's happening here?

229
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Am I going crazy?

230
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,120
2 October

231
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,800
I shall not leave my home.

232
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,600
I will not run away because of this Thing.

233
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
But it might make me crazy.

234
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
5 October

235
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,600
I've invited my friend, Harker, to stay here.

236
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,920
I'll say nothing.

237
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
Maybe he'll find an answer.

238
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
Maybe he'll see the Thing too.

239
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,640
Can the dog see it?

240
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,320
I'm sure that the dog hears it.

241
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,840
It hears things that I can't hear.

242
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,560
Can the dog see things that I can't see?

243
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
Perhaps that is the answer.

244
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:44,480
If there are sounds that men can't hear, 
are there colors that men can't see?

245
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,240
Is the Damned Thing a color that men can't see?
