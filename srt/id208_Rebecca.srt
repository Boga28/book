CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,200
Meet Maxim de Winter

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,640
What would I be today if I had not gone 
to Monte Carlo with Mrs Van Hopper?  

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,880
I would have lived another life. I 
would have become a different person.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,120
Mrs Van Hopper was not a pleasant woman. She 
loved to meet people who were rich and famous.  

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,360
Every summer, Mrs Van Hopper stayed at the Hotel 
Cote d'Azur, the biggest and most expensive hotel  

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,720
in Monte Carlo. Here, Mrs Van Hopper found out 
which well-known people were staying in the town.  

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,160
She always found an excuse to speak to 
them. Then, pretending to know them well,  

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,920
she asked her victims rude questions 
in her loud American voice.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,680
I was young and shy. I hated my life 
with Mrs Van Hopper, but she paid me  

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,040
a little money to be her companion. I was not 
exactly a servant and certainly not a friend.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,760
We must have looked a strange pair as we 
walked into the hotel restaurant that day.  

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,120
Mrs Van Hopper walked in front of me on 
her high-heeled shoes. Her fat, heavy body  

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,800
swayed above her short fat legs. I followed 
slowly, my eyes looking down at the floor.  

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
With my straight hair and badly-fitting 
clothes I looked like an awkward schoolgirl.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,280
Mrs Van Hopper sat down at her usual table 
and stared at everyone in the restaurant.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
'There isn't one well-known person 
here,' she said in her loud voice.  

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,840
'There's no one I want to talk to.'

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,440
Mrs Van Hopper was very greedy. She ordered a 
large lunch for herself. Soon she was eating a  

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,680
large plateful of spaghetti. We ate in silence. 
The rich sauce ran down Mrs Van Hopper's chin.  

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,120
I looked away. Then I saw that a new 
guest was sitting down at the next table.  

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,080
Mrs Van Hopper saw him too. She put 
down her fork and stared at him hard.  

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,200
How an excited look come into her small eyes.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,720
'It's Max de Winter,' she said to 
me. 'The man who owns Manderley.  

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,040
You must have heard of it - a beautiful 
old house in the west of England.  

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,000
He looks ill, doesn't he? His wife died suddenly 
last year. They say he's broken hearted.'

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,160
I felt sorry for de Winter already. He was 
Mrs Van Hopper's next victim. She finished  

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
her meal as quickly as possible. 
I knew what she was going to do.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
There was a long seat in the hotel 
lounge, with a low table in front of it.  

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,240
The seat was between the restaurant 
and the main door of the hotel.  

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Everyone who left the restaurant 
had to walk past this seat.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,320
'I'll take my coffee in the lounge,' Mrs 
Van Hopper told the waiter, 'straight away.'

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,840
She turned to me, her eyes shining: 'Go upstairs 
and find that letter from my nephew, Billy.  

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Bring it to me in the lounge and the photographs 
too. Billy met Max de Winter in London. Be quick.'

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
I went up to Mrs Van Hopper's 
rooms as slowly as I could.  

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
I hoped that de Winter would 
get away before I returned.

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,160
When I came back with the letter, Mrs Van Hopper 
was already on the seat in the lounge. De Winter  

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,080
was sitting next to her. He was a dark-haired, 
handsome man. His face was pale and his dark  

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,520
eyes had a sad, lost look. De Winter stood up 
politely as I gave Mrs Van Hopper her letter.

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
'Mr de Winter is having coffee 
with us. Go and ask the waiter  

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
for another cup,' Mrs Van Hopper told me.

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,760
'No, you are my guests,' said 
de Winter. He called the waiter.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,760
In a moment, de Winter was 
sitting on a small chair  

44
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,240
and I was next to Mrs Van Hopper on the long seat.

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,240
'I recognized you at once,' Mrs Van Hopper said.  

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,360
'I met you at my nephew's party, in 
London. But I don't suppose you remember an  

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,320
old woman like me?' And Mrs Van Hopper 
gave de Winter one of her biggest smiles.

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,840
'You are wrong, I could never forget you,' 
said de Winter in a cold, hard voice.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,080
'Billy's on holiday now,' Mrs Van 
Hopper went on. 'He loves travelling.  

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,200
But if he had a home like Manderley, he would 
never leave it. People say that Manderley's  

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,480
one of the most beautiful houses in England. I 
wonder what you are doing here in Monte Carlo?'

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,080
For a few moments there was 
silence. Then de Winter spoke.  

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
'Manderley was looking very 
lovely when I came away.'  

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,200
There was another silence. De Winter had not 
answered Mrs Van Hopper's question. She was not  

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,400
silent for long, of course. She started to tell de 
Winter all the unpleasant gossip of Monte Carlo.

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,320
After his moment of rudeness, de Winter 
listened to her politely. I looked down  

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,520
at the floor and tried not to hear Mrs Van 
Hopper's loud voice. At last she had to stop.  

58
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,640
A waiter came up to her with a message. Mrs Van 
Hopper's dressmaker was waiting for her upstairs.

59
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,160
De Winter stood up at once. 'You mustn't 
keep your dressmaker waiting,' he said.

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,320
Mrs Van Hopper smiled. 'You 
must have a drink with me,'  

61
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,920
she said. 'Why not tomorrow evening? 
I'm having a few friends...'

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,880
'I'm sorry,' de Winter said quickly. 
'I shall be away all day tomorrow.  

63
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
If you will excuse me...' He turned 
and walked out of the lounge.

64
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,560
'What a strange man Max de Winter is,' said 
Mrs Van Hopper when we were standing in the  

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,520
lift. 'He left so suddenly. But he is certainly 
an attractive man. By the way, dear, you were  

66
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,400
rather rude to him. You must look at people when 
they are speaking. You are not a child, you know.'

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,680
Mrs Van Hopper was soon busy with her dressmaker. 
I sat on a window seat, looking at the bright day  

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
outside. I could not go out. Some of Mrs 
Van Hopper's friends were coming to tea.  

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,360
They were fat, rude women like 
herself. My job was to talk to them,  

70
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,320
light their cigarettes and tidy 
the room after they had gone.

71
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
There was a knock on the door. A waiter came 
in with a note in his hand. 'Madame is in the  

72
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,280
bedroom,' I told him. But the note was for me. 
There were a few words in an unknown handwriting.

73
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
'Forgive me. I was very rude after lunch.'  

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,840
The note was not signed, but 
I knew it was from de Winter.

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,440
'Is there an answer?' the waiter asked 
me. I looked up. 'No. No answer,' I said.

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
After the waiter had gone, I put the note 
in my pocket. Mrs Van Hopper called me from  

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:33,840
her bedroom. I got up slowly, thinking 
about de Winter and about Manderley.
 
 

78
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
CHAPTER TWO

79
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
A Day Out Together

80
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,400
The following day, Mrs Van Hopper woke up 
with a sore throat and a high temperature.  

81
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
I rang up her doctor and he came round at once.

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,400
'You have flu, Madame,' the doctor 
told her. 'You won't get better  

83
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
unless you stay quietly in 
bed. Your heart isn't strong.  

84
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,640
You'll need a nurse to look after you. 
You must stay in bed for a week or two.'

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,680
'I'm sure I could look after Mrs Van Hopper,' 
I said. But the doctor said no. To my surprise,  

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Mrs Van Hopper agreed with him. Monte Carlo had 
begun to bore her. She would enjoy staying in bed.  

87
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
She would enjoy giving orders 
to the nurse as well as to me.

88
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,560
The nurse soon arrived and I was no longer wanted. 
I went down to the restaurant by myself. I was  

89
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,800
glad to be alone. It was half an hour before our 
usual lunch-time. The restaurant was almost empty.  

90
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,080
I went to our usual table. Then I saw 
that de Winter was already at his table.  

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,200
It was too late for me to go back. I sat down 
awkwardly trying not to look at him. As I picked  

92
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,240
up the menu, I knocked over the flowers on the 
table. The water went all over the cloth and  

93
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,720
ran down on to my skirt. The waiter was at the 
other end of the restaurant and saw nothing.  

94
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
In a moment, de Winter was standing by my chair.

95
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
'You can't sit here now,' he said. He 
called to the waiter who came up at once.  

96
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,480
'Lay another place at my table,' de Winter 
said. 'This lady is lunching with me.'

97
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,600
'Oh no,' I said. 'I couldn't...'

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,280
'Why not?' he said. 'I want you to have 
lunch with me. I was going to ask you anyway.  

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,040
Come and sit down. You needn't 
talk if you don't want to.'

100
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,760
We ordered our food and sat for a 
time in a pleasant, easy silence.

101
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,240
'What's happened to your friend?' de Winter asked 
me. I told him about Mrs Van Hopper's illness.

102
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,840
'I'm sorry,' he said politely. 
'You got my note, I suppose.  

103
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,120
It's very kind of you to lunch 
with me after my rudeness.'

104
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
'You were not rude,' I said. 'At 
least, she did not think you were.  

105
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,280
She is always so curious about anyone important.'

106
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,320
'Important? Why does she think that 
I'm important?' de Winter asked.

107
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,200
'I think it's because of Manderley,'  

108
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,160
I said. He did not answer. I felt that 
he did not want to talk about his home.

109
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
'Your friend is very different 
from you,' he said at last.  

110
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,400
'And she's much older than 
you too. Is she a relation?'

111
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,600
'Mrs Van Hopper is not my friend,' I said. 
'I work for her. I have to, I need the money.  

112
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
I have no family and there 
is nothing else I can do.'

113
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,760
De Winter asked me more questions about myself. 
I forgot my shyness. I told him about my father,  

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,320
who had been a painter. I talked about my 
mother and her great love for my father.  

115
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
When my father had died very suddenly, my 
mother had lived only a few weeks after him.

116
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,760
I suddenly realized that we had been 
sitting at the table for more than an  

117
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
hour. I began to apologize.

118
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,760
'But I've enjoyed this hour 
so much,' de Winter said.  

119
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,400
'We are alike in some ways. We are both alone 
in the world. I have a sister, but that's all.'

120
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,760
'You forget,' I told him, 'that 
you have a home and I have none.'

121
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,000
'An empty house, even a very beautiful 
one, can be lonely,' de Winter said.

122
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,240
I thought for a moment that he was 
going to tell me about Manderley.  

123
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,880
But instead he said, 'Well, I suppose you have a 
holiday this afternoon. What are you going to do?'

124
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
I told him that I was going to do some sketching.  

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,520
I wanted to draw some of the old houses in a 
nearby town. The bus left at half past two.

126
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,720
'I'll drive you there in my car,' de Winter 
said. 'Go upstairs and get your coat.'

127
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,760
I got my things very quietly. I did not want Mrs 
Van Hopper to hear me. I ran down the stairs,  

128
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,840
holding my gloves in one hand. I felt excited 
and grown-up. I did not feel shy with de Winter.  

129
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
He enjoyed my company. He had asked 
me to go out with him in his car.

130
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,640
We soon reached the place where 
I wanted to sketch. But the wind  

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,520
was too strong - it blew the paper away. 
We got into the car again and drove on,  

132
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,040
up the steep mountain road. Then suddenly 
the road came to an end. De Winter stopped  

133
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,680
the car at the very edge. Far below us lay 
the sea. I felt cold and a little afraid.

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,480
'Do you know this place?' I said. 
'Have you been here before?'

135
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,160
De Winter looked at me as though I were 
a stranger. He was lost in the past.  

136
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,320
There was a strange, faraway look on his face. 
He looked like a man walking in his sleep.

137
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,200
'It's getting late, shall we go home?' 
I said. Then he looked at me and smiled.

138
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,440
'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I should 
not have brought you up here.  

139
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,280
Yes, I have been here before, many years ago.'

140
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,920
Those years seemed to stretch between us. For 
the first time, I wished that I had not come.

141
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
De Winter turned the car carefully, and 
we drove down the twisting road again.  

142
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
The sun was setting now and 
the air was cold and clear.

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,040
Then, at last, he began to talk about 
Manderley. He did not talk about his life there,  

144
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,080
but about the house itself. He told me about 
the gardens and the flowers in the woods.  

145
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
He told me about the sea. It was so near 
that the sound of its waters could always  

146
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
be heard from the house. He told me about 
a little, secret valley close to the sea.  

147
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,920
This little valley, hidden away from the 
world, was full of the scent of flowers.

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,760
Then we were back in Monte Carlo. 
We drove slowly through the brightly  

149
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
lit streets towards the hotel. I took 
my gloves from the shelf of the car.  

150
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,840
There was a book there. I looked 
at it, trying to read the title.

151
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,640
'You can take the book and look at it, if you 
like,' de Winter said. I was glad and I held  

152
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,840
the book tightly in my hand. I wanted to have 
something of his now that our day was over.

153
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,520
'Out you get,' he said, 'I must put the car away.  

154
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,160
I won't see you tonight. I shall 
be out. But thank you for today.'

155
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
I walked slowly up the hotel steps. I felt 
like a child going home after a party.  

156
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,600
I thought of the long hours to 
bedtime. I could not meet Mrs Van  

157
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Hopper and answer the endless questions. 
I went into the lounge and ordered tea.

158
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,040
The waiter brought me tea that was 
nearly cold. The sandwiches were dry,  

159
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,920
but I ate them without thinking. In my 
mind I was with Max de Winter at Manderley.  

160
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
If he loved his home so much, why had he left it?

161
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,560
I picked up the book he had 
given me. It was a book of poems.  

162
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,840
On the front page there was some writing 
- hard, clear writing in black ink:

163
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,400
"Max - from Rebecca, 17th May."

164
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,920
The name Rebecca stood out black and strong. The 
"R" was tall, much bigger than the other letters.  

165
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,600
I shut the book quickly. I remembered what Mrs 
Van Hopper had told me about de Winter's wife.

166
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,480
'It was dreadful,' she had said. 'Her death 
was in all the newspapers. They say he never  

167
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,720
talks about it, never says her name. Rebecca was 
drowned, you know, in the sea near Manderley.'

168
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,400
I stood up slowly, the book in my hand.  

169
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,200
I walked unhappily to the lift 
and back to Mrs Van Hopper.
 
 

170
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,680
CHAPTER THREE

171
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,240
In Love

172
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,200
I was twenty-one and de Winter was 
the first man I had ever loved.  

173
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,320
First love is not always happy. It can 
sometimes be like a terrible illness.

174
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,840
Mrs Van Hopper had been in bed for about ten days.  

175
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,800
She was bored now, and more bad tempered than 
usual. She asked me what I had been doing.

176
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,320
'You haven't got enough to do and so you 
are doing nothing,' she said unpleasantly.  

177
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,080
'You never have any drawings to show 
me. When I ask you to do some shopping,  

178
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,840
you always forget something. You are 
getting lazy without me to watch you.'

179
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,800
I did not reply. I could not tell 
Mrs Van Hopper that every morning  

180
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,240
I drove with de Winter in his car. Every 
day I had lunch with him at his table.

181
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,800
I have forgotten the places we went to, but I have 
not forgotten the excitement of those mornings.  

182
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
I remember how I ran down the stairs 
because the lift was too slow.  

183
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,960
He was always waiting in his car, reading the 
paper. When he saw me, he would smile and say,  

184
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,520
'Well, how is the companion this 
morning? Where would you like to go?'

185
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,680
If we had driven round-in 
circles, I would not have cared.  

186
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,440
I was happy to sit next to him, to be alone 
with him. But the time always went too quickly.  

187
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
There was a clock in the car. I could 
not help looking at it as we drove along.

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
'If only we could keep our 
memories like scent in a bottle,'  

189
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,520
I said one day. 'And then we could open the bottle 
when we wanted to remember the moment again.'

190
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,240
'And what moment would you like to 
keep?' de Winter said with a smile.

191
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,320
'I'm not sure,' I began. Then I said quickly, 'I'd 
like to keep this moment and never forget it.'

192
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,160
De Winter laughed. I suddenly 
felt very young and very silly.

193
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,600
'I wish,' I said angrily, '... 
I wish I was a woman of about  

194
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,840
thirty-six. I wish I was wearing a lot 
of make-up and had expensive clothes.'

195
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,320
'You would not be in this car now 
if you were like that,' he said.

196
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
'Why do you ask me to come out in 
your car, day after day?' I said.  

197
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,840
'I'm young, I know nothing. I am 
not an interesting person at all.  

198
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,160
You know all about me now. I have told you 
everything. But I know nothing about you,  

199
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,200
nothing - except that you live at Manderley 
and... and that your wife is dead.'

200
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,440
I had said the words, at last. Your wife. 
Your wife. He would never forgive me.  

201
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,520
I shall never drive with him again, I 
thought. He slowed down the car and we  

202
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,840
stopped by the side of the road. 
Then he turned to me and spoke.

203
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,560
'A little while ago, you said you 
wanted to keep your memories. For me,  

204
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:15,680
it is different. All my memories are unhappy. I 
want to forget them. Something happened a year  

205
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,880
ago that changed my whole life. I want to forget 
everything that happened to me before that time.  

206
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,720
That's why I came to Monte Carlo. If you had 
not been here, I would have left long ago.  

207
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,840
I ask you to drive with me because 
I like you. I enjoy your company.  

208
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,120
If you don't believe me, you 
can get out of the car now.'

209
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
I sat very still. I could not speak. I 
could feel the tears coming into my eyes.  

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
'I want to go home now,' I said.

211
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,080
Without a word, he started 
the car and we drove on.  

212
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,320
The tears began to run down my cheeks. 
Suddenly de Winter took my hand and kissed it.  

213
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,040
Then he gave me his handkerchief. I wiped 
my red eyes. I had never felt more alone.

214
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,080
'To hell with this,' he said and put his 
arm round my shoulders. 'You are so young,  

215
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,800
I don't know how to speak to you. Forget 
everything I told you. Let's start again.  

216
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,680
My family always call me Maxim. 
I'd like you to call me that too.'

217
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,520
I smiled then, and he laughed back at me.  

218
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,760
The morning was happy again. The afternoon 
with Mrs Van Hopper did not matter. I could  

219
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,920
look forward to tomorrow morning and the morning 
after. I could call him Maxim. He had kissed me.

220
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,200
I had to play cards with Mrs Van Hopper that 
afternoon, but I was still happy. When we had  

221
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,400
finished our game, Mrs Van Hopper said, 'Tell 
me, is Max de Winter still in the hotel?'

222
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,920
'Yes. Yes, I think so. He comes into 
the restaurant sometimes,' I said.

223
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,440
Someone has told her, I thought.  

224
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,040
Someone has seen us together. I waited for 
her to ask more questions. But she did not.

225
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,840
'He's an attractive man,' she said, 'but 
not easy to know. I never saw his wife.  

226
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,640
People say she was very lovely. She was clever 
too, and always beautifully dressed, of course.  

227
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,240
Her death was very sudden. 
Everyone says he adored her.'

228
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,080
I did not answer. I was thinking about Rebecca - 
beautiful and clever. People could not forget her.  

229
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
Somehow, she and her beauty had not died.

230
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,200
In my bedroom was a book that Rebecca had held in 
her hands. His family called him Maxim. Rebecca  

231
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,200
had called him Max. I thought of the writing 
on that page. It was bold and full of life.  

232
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,040
Rebecca was all the things that I would never 
be. I thought of all the letters Rebecca had  

233
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,800
written to her husband. They must have 
been full of the life they had shared.

234
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,840
I thought I could hear her voice 
calling him. She called him Max.  

235
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,840
It was her special name for him. 
And I had to call him Maxim.
 
 

236
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,840
CHAPTER FOUR

237
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
I Leave Monte Carlo

238
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,640
Two days later, everything had changed. Mrs Van 
Hopper and I were ready to leave Monte Carlo.  

239
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
All the trunks and bags were packed. All 
the drawers and cupboards were empty.

240
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,880
Mrs Van Hopper had read a letter 
from her daughter at breakfast.  

241
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,680
'Helen is sailing for New York 
on Saturday. Her child's ill.  

242
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,960
We are going too. I'm tired of living 
here. How would you like to see New York?'

243
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,920
The thought of leaving Monte Carlo and 
Maxim de Winter was a terrible one.  

244
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
My unhappiness must have shown on my face.

245
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,680
'What a strange child you are,'  

246
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,320
Mrs Van Hopper said. 'I can't understand 
you. I thought you didn't like Monte Carlo.'

247
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
'I've got used to it,' I said.

248
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,960
'Well, you'll have to get used to New York, 
that's all. We're going on the same boat as Helen.  

249
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,800
You'll have to arrange everything at 
once. Go down to the hotel office now.  

250
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,560
You will be too busy to feel unhappy.'

251
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
She laughed unpleasantly at my sad face.  

252
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,320
She walked over to the telephone. She wanted 
to tell everyone that she was leaving.

253
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,160
I went into the bathroom and locked the 
door. I wanted to be alone for a few minutes.  

254
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,360
My happiness was at an end. By tomorrow evening, 
I should be on the train. The train would carry  

255
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,120
me away from Maxim, mile by mile. He would be 
sitting in the restaurant, reading perhaps and not  

256
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,840
thinking of me. Where would I say goodbye to him? 
In the lounge, with Mrs Van Hopper standing near?  

257
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,080
I was going and everything was over. We 
would say goodbye like two strangers.

258
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,080
Mrs Van Hopper knocked on the bathroom door.

259
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
'What are you doing in there?'  

260
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,440
she said. 'There's no time to dream this 
morning. There's too much to be done.'

261
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,560
I washed my face with cold water and came out of 
the bathroom at once. I spent the rest of the day  

262
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,840
packing and arranging the journey. In the evening, 
Mrs Van Hopper's friends came to say goodbye.  

263
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,600
We had dinner upstairs and Mrs Van Hopper went to 
bed early. I had not seen Maxim all day. I went  

264
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,400
down to the lounge at half past nine. A waiter 
saw me. He knew who I was looking for, of course.

265
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,480
'Mr de Winter is out this evening,' he told 
me. 'He will not be back before midnight.'

266
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,680
I walked slowly back up the 
stairs. Tomorrow would be too late.  

267
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,480
I should not be able to speak to 
him at all. That night I cried.  

268
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,560
My pillow was wet with tears. In the 
morning, my eyes were red and swollen.

269
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,680
'You haven't got a cold, have you?' said 
Mrs Van Hopper when she saw my face.

270
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,360
'No,' I said, 'I don't think 
so.' I tried not to look at her.

271
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,520
'I hate waiting around when everything is packed,' 
Mrs Van Hopper said bad temperedly. 'We ought to  

272
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,360
have gone on the earlier train.' She looked at 
her watch. 'I think we could still catch it.  

273
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,480
Go down to the reception desk and ask. Hurry up.'

274
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,240
So my last morning was to be taken away from me.  

275
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,840
I would not see Maxim. Suddenly, I made up my 
mind. Instead of going down to the reception desk,  

276
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,080
I ran up the stairs. I knew the number 
of his room. I knocked on the door.

277
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,720
'Come in,' Maxim shouted. I opened the 
door. He was having breakfast at a small  

278
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,040
table in his sitting-room. I stood by 
the door, feeling silly and awkward.

279
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,040
'What do you want?' he said. 'Is something wrong?'

280
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,840
'I've come to say goodbye,' I said. 'We're 
going this morning. In about an hour.  

281
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,240
I thought I would not see you again.'

282
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,000
Maxim stared at me. 'Why didn't you 
tell me about this before?' he said.

283
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,040
'Mrs Van Hopper only decided to leave 
yesterday. Her daughter sails for New  

284
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,080
York on Saturday and we're going with her. 
I don't want to go. I'll hate New York.'

285
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
'Why go there, then?'

286
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,680
'I have to. I work for her, you know 
that. I can't afford to leave her.'

287
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,600
'Sit down,' he said. 'Have some coffee.'

288
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,360
'I haven't time,' I told him. 
'I should be downstairs now.'

289
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,120
'Never mind about that, I've got to talk to you.'

290
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
I sat down at the table.

291
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
'So Mrs Van Hopper wants to go 
home,' said Maxim. 'So do I.  

292
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,360
She goes to New York and I go to Manderley. 
Which do you prefer? You can take your choice.'

293
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,120
'Please don't joke about it,' I 
said. 'I must say goodbye now.'

294
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,080
'I'm not joking,' said Maxim. 'Either 
you go to America with Mrs Van Hopper  

295
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,760
or you come home to Manderley with me.'

296
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
'Do you want a secretary?' I 
asked, not understanding him.

297
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
'No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.'

298
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,080
I sat with my hands in my lap, 
watching him drink his coffee.

299
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,280
'You can't marry me,' I said at 
last. 'I'm different from you.  

300
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,240
I don't belong to your kind of world. I 
don't belong to a place like Manderley.'

301
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,400
'What do you know about Manderley?' Maxim said. 
'I want you to marry me. Are you going to?'

302
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,320
I sat there, staring at him. 
I could not think clearly.

303
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,760
'The idea doesn't seem to please you,' Maxim 
said. 'I'm sorry, I thought you loved me.'

304
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,000
'I do love you,' I said, 'I do. I've been crying 
all night. I thought I would never see you again.'

305
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,200
When I said this, Maxim laughed 
and put his hand over mine.

306
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,280
'One day I'll remind you of those words. 
It's a pity you have to grow up,' he said.

307
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,840
Was Maxim laughing at me? Was it all a joke?

308
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,240
He saw the look on my face. 'I haven't done 
this very well, have I?' Maxim said. 'Men don't  

309
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,920
usually propose at breakfast. But I'll take you to 
Venice for our honeymoon. We'll travel round Italy  

310
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,920
for a time. Then, in the spring, we'll go back to 
Manderley. I want to show you Manderley so much.'

311
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,320
Maxim wanted to show me Manderley. Suddenly I 
believed everything. I would be Maxim's wife.  

312
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,560
We would walk in the gardens of 
Manderley together. We would walk  

313
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:33,120
through that hidden valley to the sea. 
Mrs de Winter - I would be Mrs de Winter.

314
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,040
'Am I going to tell Mrs Van Hopper 
or are you?' said Maxim with a smile.

315
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,600
I had forgotten all about Mrs Van Hopper. 
'You tell her,' I said. 'She'll be so angry.'

316
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,200
We got up from the table and 
walked out of the room together.  

317
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:56,320
Maxim took my hand. 'I'm forty-two,' he 
said. 'That must seem very old to you.'

318
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,600
'Oh, no,' I said. 'I don't like young men.' I was 
still afraid that Maxim would change his mind.

319
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
We came to the door of Mrs Van Hopper's rooms.

320
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,960
'I think I'll talk to her alone,' Maxim said. 
'I'll tell her we are getting married very soon.  

321
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,400
We'll have a quiet wedding. Everything 
can be arranged in a few days.'

322
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,000
'Of course,' I said. 'I don't want a lot of fuss.'

323
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
I opened the door.

324
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,840
'Is that you?' called Mrs Van Hopper. 'Where have 
you been? What have you been doing all this time?'

325
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,080
I did not know whether to laugh or cry. 
Maxim walked towards the sitting-room.

326
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
'I'm afraid it's all my fault,' he said  

327
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,120
and then he shut the door. I 
went into my bedroom and waited.

328
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,640
I wondered what Maxim was 
saying to Mrs Van Hopper.  

329
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
Was he saying, 'I love her. I 
want to marry her at once.'?

330
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,040
Love. Maxim had not said anything to me about 
love. He had said we would get married. But he had  

331
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:03,680
not said that he loved me. He had loved Rebecca, 
of course. How could he love me, after her?  

332
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
I would be a companion for him. 
Someone to make him laugh perhaps.

333
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,200
The book of poems was beside me, on the bed. I 
opened it. I read again, 'Max, from Rebecca.'  

334
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,000
She was dead. But the writing 
still looked fresh and alive.

335
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,440
I took some scissors and cut the page out of the 
book. I tore up the page. I lit a match and set  

336
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,840
fire to the pieces. The paper twisted, blackened 
and turned to ashes. The letter "R" was the  

337
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,840
last to be burnt. Then the flame destroyed it. I 
washed my hands. I felt better, much better now.

338
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,240
As I stood there, the door 
opened and Maxim came in.

339
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,760
'Everything is all right,' he said. 'She could 
not speak at first. She was too surprised.  

340
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,640
Go in and talk to her. I'm going 
downstairs to arrange about her train.  

341
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
I don't want her to come to the wedding.'

342
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,640
Maxim was smiling, but he said nothing about 
being happy. He said nothing about love.  

343
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,800
I walked slowly into Mrs Van Hopper's bedroom. She 
was standing by the window, smoking a cigarette.  

344
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
She turned round and looked at me carefully.

345
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,800
'Well,' she said, 'you are more clever 
than I thought. How did you do it?'

346
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,600
I did not know what to say. Mrs Van Hopper was 
smiling, but there was no kindness in her smile.  

347
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,760
'It was lucky for you that I was ill,' she said.  

348
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,160
'You certainly made the most of your time. 
He tells me that he wants to marry you in  

349
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,960
a few days. Well, I can't stop you. 
He's much older than you, you know.'

350
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,160
'He's only forty-two,' I said.  

351
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,120
'I know what I'm doing.' Mrs Van Hopper looked 
at me again with the same unpleasant smile.

352
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,080
'I hope you do. You won't find 
it easy to look after Manderley.  

353
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,040
You haven't any experience and you're too shy.  

354
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,560
Max de Winter is very attractive, of course. 
But I think you're making a big mistake.'

355
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,560
I did not say anything. I was young 
and shy, I knew that. But I was going  

356
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,520
to be Mrs de Winter. I was going to live at 
Manderley. And I was going to make Maxim happy.

357
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Mrs Van Hopper put out her cigarette. 
She walked slowly towards me.

358
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
'Of course,' she said, 'you know 
why he is marrying you, don't you?  

359
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,520
He's not in love with you. The truth is he's 
lonely by himself at Manderley. He can't live  

360
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:49,840
in that empty house without Rebecca. He's marrying 
you because he can't go on living there alone.'
 
 

361
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
CHAPTER FIVE

362
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,720
I Come to Manderley

363
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,120
Wе саmе to Manderley early in May. It was the 
best time of year, before the heat of summer.  

364
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,600
When we left London, it was raining 
hard. I remember Maxim saying,  

365
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,480
'This is London rain. The sun will be 
shining for you when we come to Manderley.'

366
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,600
He was right. Long before we reached 
Manderley, there was blue sky over our heads.  

367
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,240
I was glad to see the sun. I 
welcomed it as a sign of happiness.

368
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,760
'Feeling better?' said Maxim, looking at me. 
I smiled at him and took his hand. It was so  

369
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,880
easy for Maxim. He was going back to his own home. 
But for me, everything was new and strange. I was  

370
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,640
going to Manderley for the first time. And I was 
going there as the second wife of Maxim de Winter.

371
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,240
'Only two more miles,' said Maxim 
at last. 'Can you see those trees  

372
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,080
on the hill in front of us? Manderley 
is in the valley beyond those trees.'

373
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,640
I tried to smile but suddenly 
I felt lonely and afraid.  

374
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
I was like a child on her first day at school.

375
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
Turning a corner, we came to a crossroads 
and the beginning of a high wall.

376
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,760
'Here we are,' Maxim said. 'Manderley at last.' 
I could hear the excitement in his voice.

377
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,080
The road turned again. On the left, were two 
high iron gates and beside them a small lodge.  

378
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,280
The gates were wide open for us. People were 
looking out of the windows of the lodge.  

379
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:28,000
They were looking at me. I sat back in my 
seat. I wanted to hide from their curious eyes.

380
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,080
'You mustn't mind if people stare at you,' 
Maxim said. 'They are all very interested  

381
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,040
in you. Don't worry. Be yourself and 
everyone at Manderley will love you.  

382
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:45,040
Mrs Danvers looks after the house. She's been 
housekeeper here for years. Leave everything to  

383
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,800
her. She may be rather strange at first, but don't 
worry about that. She will soon get used to you.'

384
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,440
We were going along the drive now that led up 
to the house. The drive turned and twisted like  

385
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,000
a snake. The tall trees met over our heads. Only a 
little sunlight came through their thick branches.  

386
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:12,560
Everything was very quiet. On and on we went. 
Then suddenly the trees came to an end. The sun  

387
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,320
shone again. Beautiful high bushes covered with 
bright red flowers stood on either side of us.

388
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,120
We were not far from the house now. The drive 
widened. We turned the last corner and there was  

389
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,880
Manderley. The old house was perfect. 
It was built in a small hollow and  

390
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,840
its grey stones glowed in the sunlight. 
Smooth green lawns surrounded the house.  

391
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,400
Beyond the lawns were gardens 
and beyond the gardens, the sea.

392
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,440
Maxim drove up to the wide stone steps 
and stopped the car in front of them.  

393
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,800
At the top of the steps, a 
big door stood wide open.  

394
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,640
I saw that the hall beyond was full of people. 
I could see their faces, all turned towards us.  

395
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,120
I was suddenly shy and afraid again. 'What's 
the matter?' I said. 'Who are all those people?'

396
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,520
'I'm sorry,' Maxim said. 'This must be 
Mrs Danvers' idea. Everyone who works  

397
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,040
at Manderley is here. Don't look so frightened. 
You won't have to say anything. I'll do it all.'

398
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,640
An old man with a kind face came down the steps.

399
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,120
'Well, here we are, Frith,' 
said Maxim. 'Everyone well?'

400
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,280
'Yes, thank you, sir,' said Frith. 'We are 
all very glad to see you at home again.  

401
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,320
We hope you are well. And Madam too, of course.'

402
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,120
'Yes, we are both well, thank you, Frith. But 
we're tired from the drive and we want our tea.  

403
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,600
I didn't expect all these people.'

404
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,680
'Mrs Danvers' orders, sir,' said Frith.

405
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,080
'I thought so,' Maxim said.  

406
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,280
'Come on,' he said to me. 'It won't take long 
and then you can have your tea in peace.'

407
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,640
We went together up the wide stone steps. Inside 
the open door, the servants stood in two lines.  

408
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:08,000
A tall, thin woman dressed in black came towards 
us. Her pale, thin face was hard. There was no  

409
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,840
welcome in her dark eyes. The hand she placed 
in mine was cold and heavy, like something dead.

410
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,200
'This is Mrs Danvers, our housekeeper,' said 
Maxim. The woman began to speak in a cold,  

411
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,440
lifeless voice. I remember nothing of what she 
said. I suppose she was welcoming me to Manderley.  

412
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,000
As I thanked her, Mrs Danvers looked at me with 
her hard, dark eyes. I dropped my gloves on  

413
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,080
the floor and Mrs Danvers picked them up 
with a twisted little smile on her lips.  

414
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,840
She could see that I was awkward and shy, and 
a little afraid of my new life at Manderley.

415
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,920
Maxim noticed nothing. He thanked Mrs Danvers 
quickly and took me into the library for tea.  

416
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,840
We were alone at last.

417
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,360
A dog ran up from the fireside to greet us. He 
went first to Maxim and then sat down beside me.  

418
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,840
I was glad of the dog's friendly welcome. 
The library was a large comfortable room.  

419
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,640
Its walls were covered with books 
from the floor to the ceiling.  

420
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Comfortable chairs stood on either 
side of a great open fireplace.  

421
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,560
From its long windows I could see the lawns 
and beyond the lawns, the sea. There was a  

422
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,840
quiet peace in the room. It was a place for 
rest, for reading and for quiet thinking.

423
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
Tea was brought to us by Frith and a younger 
servant. There was a special table and a  

424
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,680
snow-white cloth to cover it. The teapot and 
kettle were of silver and the china was very fine.  

425
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,240
There were sandwiches, bread and 
butter and several kinds of cake.  

426
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,040
There was far too much food for two people. But 
this was the tea served at Manderley every day.

427
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,000
Maxim sat in a chair by the fire reading 
the letters that had been waiting for him.  

428
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,320
Now and again, he looked up at me and smiled. 
I leant back in my chair, drinking my tea  

429
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,920
and trying to feel at home. It was true. 
Manderley was my home now - my home and Maxim's.  

430
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,320
But somehow I still could not believe it.

431
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,600
My thoughts were interrupted by the 
opening of the door. It was Frith.

432
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,160
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said. 'Mrs Danvers 
asked if you would like to see your room.'

433
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,240
Maxim looked up from his letters. 'What do the 
rooms in the east wing look like now?' he said.

434
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,760
'Very nice indeed, sir,' Frith replied. 'I 
think you will be very comfortable there.'

435
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,440
'Have you been making changes?' I asked.

436
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,560
'Oh, nothing much,' said Maxim. 'They have been 
getting the rooms in the east wing ready for us.  

437
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,040
There is a lovely view of the rose-garden from  

438
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,800
there. You go and make friends with 
Mrs Danvers. I'll come up later.'

439
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,720
I got up slowly and went out with Frith into 
the hall. I did not want to be alone with  

440
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,480
Mrs Danvers. The hall seemed very big, and my 
footsteps sounded very loud on the stone floor.

441
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,120
Mrs Danvers was standing at the top of the wide 
flight of stairs. Her dark eyes watched me as  

442
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,400
I walked slowly up the stairs towards her. 
'I hope I haven't kept you waiting,' I said.

443
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,000
'It is my duty to wait for you, Madam,' Mrs 
Danvers said. 'I'm here to carry out your orders.'

444
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,080
She led me along a wide passage. We passed 
through doors and up and down wide stairs.  

445
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,240
At last Mrs Danvers opened a door leading 
into a small room. This room led into a large,  

446
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,000
light bedroom with wide windows. I went at once 
to a window and looked out. The rose-garden lay  

447
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,920
below me. Beyond the rose-garden, the 
smooth grass stretched to the woods.

448
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
'You can't see the sea from here,' 
I said, turning to Mrs Danvers.

449
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,840
'No, not from this wing,' she answered,  

450
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,320
'and you can't hear it either. You 
would never know the sea was so near.'

451
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,520
Mrs Danvers spoke in a strange way, as 
though this was somehow important to her.

452
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,840
'I'm sorry about that; I like the sea,' I said.  

453
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,720
'But this is a very charming room. 
I'm sure I shall be comfortable here.'

454
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,600
'Mr de Winter gave very careful 
orders in his letter about this room.  

455
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,920
The rooms here have been 
specially arranged for you.'

456
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
'Then this was not his bedroom before?'

457
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,200
'Oh, no, Madam. He has never used this room.'

458
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,080
There was silence. I did not know what to 
say. I wished Mrs Danvers would go away.

459
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,800
'I suppose you have been at 
Manderley for many years,' I said.

460
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,760
'Yes, Madam. I came here when the first Mrs de 
Winter was a bride.' Her voice was suddenly harsh.  

461
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,280
There was some colour in her pale face now. And 
for a moment I saw a look of hatred in her eyes.

462
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,400
'Mrs Danvers,' I heard myself 
saying, 'I hope we shall be friends.  

463
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,200
This sort of life is new to me. I 
do want to make Mr de Winter happy.  

464
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,160
I know I can leave the housekeeping to 
you. I shan't want to make any changes.'

465
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,800
'Very well,' she said. 'I 
hope you will be satisfied.  

466
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,960
I have been looking after the house for the past 
year. When the late Mrs de Winter was alive, there  

467
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,520
were lots of parties and visitors, of course. 
She liked to look after everything herself.'

468
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,520
'I would rather leave it to 
you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.  

469
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,320
'And I'm sure we'll be very 
comfortable in these rooms.'

470
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,480
'Mr de Winter said you would rather be on this 
side of the house. They used the rooms in the  

471
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,440
west wing when Mrs de Winter was alive. 
The windows there look down to the sea.'

472
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,840
There was a sound outside the door and Mrs 
Danvers stopped talking. Maxim came into the room.

473
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,240
'Well, what do you think?'  

474
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,960
Maxim said to me. 'I hope you like the rooms. 
I think you've done very well, Mrs Danvers.'

475
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,920
'Thank you, sir,' she said. Then she 
turned and went quietly out of the room.

476
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,280
Maxim walked to the window. 'I love the 
rose-garden,' he said. 'There's something  

477
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,800
very quiet and peaceful about this room. 
How did you get on with Mrs Danvers? She's  

478
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,360
a strange woman in many ways. I think that 
some of the young servants are afraid of her.'

479
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,680
'I expect we'll get on well when 
she knows me better,' I said.  

480
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
'She may not like me at first, of course.'

481
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,480
'Not like you? Why shouldn't she like you?'  

482
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,000
said Maxim and he came across 
the room and kissed me gently.

483
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,360
'Let's forget about Mrs Danvers,' he said. 
'Come along, and I'll show you Manderley.'

484
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,200
I felt happier as I walked 
through the house with Maxim.  

485
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,840
We looked at the pictures in the long 
gallery and at most of the rooms downstairs.  

486
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,160
Maxim put his arm round my shoulder. I began 
to feel that Manderley really was my home.

487
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,520
After dinner, we sat in the library. The curtains 
were drawn and more logs put on the fire. It was  

488
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,560
new for us to sit together quietly like this. 
In Italy we had walked about in the evenings,  

489
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,280
or gone for a drive. Maxim sat in the 
chair to the left of the fireplace.

490
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,280
He picked up the paper. He put a cushion 
behind his head and lit a cigarette.

491
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,800
This is what he always did, I thought. 
This is what he did before he knew me.  

492
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,680
It is what he has done every evening for years.

493
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,040
Maxim did not look at me. He went on reading 
his paper. He was comfortable, the master of  

494
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,360
his house. I poured myself another cup of coffee. 
I bent down to the dog and stroked its soft ears.

495
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,040
Suddenly I shivered as though a door had opened 
behind me. Someone else had sat in my chair.  

496
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,160
Someone else had poured 
coffee and stroked the dog.  

497
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,680
I was sitting in Rebecca's chair. I 
was leaning against Rebecca's cushion.  

498
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,160
The dog, Jasper, came to me because 
in the past he had come to Rebecca.
 
 

499
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,760
CHAPTER SIX

500
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,200
In the Morning-Room

501
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,400
Life at Manderley was very carefully planned. The 
same things happened at the same time every day.  

502
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,160
I remember our first morning there very clearly. 
I had slept well and came downstairs a little  

503
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,680
after nine o'clock. To my surprise, I found 
that Maxim had nearly finished his breakfast.

504
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,400
Maxim looked up at me and smiled.

505
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,320
'I always get up early here,' he said. 'Looking 
after Manderley takes a lot of my time.  

506
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,800
I work very hard. But you don't have 
to. Help yourself to anything you want.'

507
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
I remember the size of that breakfast.  

508
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,680
It was the normal Manderley breakfast, 
but far too much for two people.  

509
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,520
As I took an egg and some coffee, I wondered 
what happened to the food that was left. Would  

510
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,440
it be eaten or thrown away? I would never know of 
course. I would certainly be too afraid to ask.

511
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,960
'My sister, Beatrice, is coming over to 
lunch with her husband,' Maxim told me.  

512
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,800
'She invited herself, of course. I 
suppose she wants to have a look at you.'

513
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,520
They're coming today?' I said, 
feeling less happy than before.

514
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,200
'Yes, but she won't stay long. I think you'll 
like Beatrice. She believes in telling the truth.  

515
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,680
If she doesn't like you, she'll tell you so.'

516
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,320
Maxim stood up and lit a cigarette.

517
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,800
'I've so many things to do this morning. 
Why don't you go into the garden.  

518
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,840
You don't mind being alone, do you?'

519
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,960
'Of course not,' I said. 'I 
shall be perfectly happy.'

520
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,360
But I did not feel very happy 
as Maxim walked out of the room.  

521
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,200
I had thought we would spend our 
first morning at Manderley together.

522
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,560
I had thought that perhaps we would walk down to 
the sea, or sit under the great tree on the lawn.

523
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,000
I finished my breakfast alone. I left the 
dining-room and went into the library.  

524
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,160
The room was cold. The fire was laid, but 
not lit. I looked round for a box of matches,  

525
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,840
but I could not find one. I went across the 
hall and into the dining-room once more. Yes,  

526
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,440
there was a box of matches on the table. I picked 
it up. At that moment, Frith came into the room.

527
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,120
'Oh, Frith,' I said awkwardly, 
'I could not find any matches.  

528
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,960
I thought I would light the fire in the 
library. It's rather cold in there.'

529
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,560
'The fire in the library is not usually 
lit until the afternoon, Madam,'  

530
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,480
he said. 'Mrs de Winter always used 
the morning-room before lunch. There  

531
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,040
is a good fire in there. Of course, I can give 
orders for the fire in the library to be lit.'

532
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,560
'Oh no,' I said. 'I'll go into the 
morning-room. Thank you, Frith.'

533
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,240
'Mrs de Winter always wrote her letters 
in the morning-room after breakfast.  

534
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,000
The house telephone is there too, 
if you want to talk to Mrs Danvers.'

535
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:50,160
'Thank you, Frith,' I said. I went into the hall 
again, I did not know which way to go. I could not  

536
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,040
tell Frith that I had never seen the morning-room. 
Maxim had not shown it to me the night before.

537
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,520
'You go through the drawing-room 
to the morning-room, Madam,'  

538
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,480
Frith said, watching me. 'Then turn to your left.'

539
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,000
'Thank you, Frith,' I said. I felt very stupid.

540
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,880
I found my way into the little morning-room.  

541
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,960
I was glad to see the dog, Jasper, 
there, sitting in front of the fire.

542
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,200
The morning-room was quite small and very 
different from the library. It was a woman's  

543
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,560
room, graceful and charming. Someone had chosen 
everything in this room with the greatest care.  

544
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,560
Each chair, each rug, each small ornament 
had been put there to make the room perfect.

545
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,200
Flowers filled the room, glowing blood-red 
flowers. They were the same flowers we had  

546
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,840
seen in the drive. A beautiful old 
writing-desk stood near the window.  

547
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,000
I went over and opened the desk carefully. Every 
drawer was labelled and everything was in order.  

548
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,120
Inside one of the drawers was a flat leather 
book: 'Guests at Manderley'. I opened the book.  

549
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,200
The writing inside the book and the 
writing on the labels was the same.  

550
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,320
I had seen that tall sloping writing before. It 
was Rebecca's writing. This was Rebecca's desk.  

551
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,760
I sat down and opened the Guest Book. Every 
page was covered with the same writing.

552
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,760
I felt that Rebecca would come 
back into the room at any moment.  

553
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,400
The mistress of the house would come in and 
find me, a stranger, sitting at her desk.

554
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,000
Suddenly the telephone on the desk began to ring.  

555
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,520
My heart jumped. I picked up the phone. 
'Who is it?' I said. 'Who do you want?'

556
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,600
'Mrs de Winter?' said a hard, 
deep voice, 'Mrs de Winter?'

557
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,760
My hand was shaking.  

558
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,120
'I'm afraid you have made a mistake,' I said. 
'Mrs de Winter has been dead for over a year.'

559
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,080
I suddenly realized what I had said.

560
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,040
'It's Mrs Danvers, Madam,' said the voice. 
'I'm speaking to you on the house telephone.'

561
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,880
'I'm so sorry, Mrs Danvers,' I said. 
'I didn't know what I was saying.  

562
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
I did not expect the telephone to ring.'

563
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,840
'I wondered if you had seen the menus for the day. 
You will find the list on the desk beside you.'

564
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,280
I found the piece of paper 
and looked at it quickly.

565
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,280
'Yes, Mrs Danvers. Yes, very nice indeed.'

566
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,560
'I'm very sorry to have disturbed you, Madam.'

567
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,520
'You didn't disturb me at all. 
Thank you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

568
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,080
I put down the phone and looked at the 
desk. I felt very stupid. Rebecca would  

569
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:37,920
not have answered like that. I thought of 
Rebecca sitting at that desk. Here she had  

570
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,760
chosen her guests and written letters to her 
friends. Who could I write to? I knew nobody.  

571
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,760
Then I thought of Mrs Van Hopper, far away in 
New York. I took a piece of paper and a pen.

572
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:58,160
'Dear Mrs Van Hopper,' I began. As I wrote I 
noticed my own handwriting for the first time.  

573
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,440
How weak and childish it was! It was 
like the writing of a schoolgirl.
 
 

574
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,440
CHAPTER SEVEN

575
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,840
You Are So Very Different...

576
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,360
When I heard the sound of a car in 
the drive, I stood up in sudden fear.  

577
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,560
Beatrice and her husband had arrived. 
They were earlier than I expected.  

578
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,240
And Maxim had not come back. I 
could not meet them by myself.

579
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,880
I ran quickly out of the morning-room. 
I took a door to the left.  

580
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:42,160
I was in a stone corridor. A servant stared at me 
in surprise. I hurried up some stairs, hoping that  

581
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,960
I could find my way to my bedroom in the east 
wing. I could stay there until Maxim came back.

582
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,160
Somehow I lost my way. But I went on and 
came to a wide staircase. I went up it.  

583
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,440
All was quiet and dark. I was in a corridor 
with doors on either side. I walked on and  

584
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,680
at last I came to a long window. I looked out. 
Below me I could see green lawns and the sea.  

585
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,480
The sea was bright green, with white-topped 
waves. It was closer than I thought, much closer.  

586
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,160
I knew then that I had walked right round 
the house. I was standing in the corridor  

587
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:25,840
of the west wing. Yes, Mrs Danvers was 
right, you could hear the sea from here.

588
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,320
I was glad that my rooms were in the east wing. 
I loved the quiet beauty of the rose-garden.  

589
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,960
The sea was too near here. As I turned to 
go back to the stairs, I heard a door open  

590
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,480
behind me. Mrs Danvers stood there. We stared 
at one another for a moment without speaking.

591
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,680
'I lost my way,' I said, 'I 
was trying to find my room.'

592
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,280
'This is the west wing,' she said. 
'Did you go into any of the rooms?  

593
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,840
If you wish to see them, please tell 
me. I could show them to you now.'

594
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,000
I shook my head. 'No, no thank you,' I said.  

595
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,920
'I must go downstairs.' As I began to walk 
towards the stairs, Mrs Danvers followed me.

596
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
'If you want to see the rooms in the west 
wing, I can show them to you at any time.'

597
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,640
'It's very kind of you, Mrs Danvers,' I said. 'I 
will let you know.' Mrs Danvers walked beside me.

598
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,640
'Major and Mrs Lacy have been here some 
time,' she said. 'Didn't you hear their  

599
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,600
car? Frith took them to the morning-room. 
I think you know your way now, don't you?'

600
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,600
'Yes, Mrs Danvers,' I said. I knew 
then that she had been watching me,  

601
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,600
laughing at my fear. As I went into 
the drawing-room, I looked back.  

602
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,360
Mrs Danvers was still watching 
me from the top of the stairs.

603
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,200
I could hear the sound of voices from 
the morning-room. I stood for a moment  

604
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,000
and then walked in.

605
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,440
'Here she is at last,' Maxim 
said. 'Where have you been hiding?  

606
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,720
Here is Beatrice and this is Giles. 
And this is Frank Crawley, our agent.'

607
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,280
Beatrice was tall, broad-shouldered and very 
much like Maxim. She shook hands with me and  

608
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,160
said to Maxim, 'She's quite different from what 
I expected. Not like your description at all.'

609
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,840
Everyone laughed, but they seemed friendly. 
Giles was a big, heavy man. His eyes smiled at  

610
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,440
me from behind his thick glasses. Frank Crawley 
was a thin man with a pleasant, worried face.  

611
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,520
Maxim had told me how hard Frank 
Crawley worked for Manderley.  

612
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,080
The men began to talk together and I 
had to answer Beatrice's questions.

613
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,600
'What do you think of Manderley?' she asked me.

614
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,160
'I haven't seen much of it yet,' I said. 
'The house is beautiful, of course. I haven't  

615
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,640
seen the gardens, but I'm sure I shall 
never get tired of them. I love walking.  

616
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,360
I can swim too, when the weather is warmer.'

617
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,480
'My dear, the water is always far 
too cold here,' said Beatrice.

618
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,520
'I don't mind that, I love swimming. 
Is it safe to swim in the bays?'  

619
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,640
Everyone stopped talking. I realized what 
I had said. Rebecca had been drowned in the  

620
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:19,040
bay. I could not look at Maxim. I bent 
down to stroke the dog's head. Then,  

621
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,920
thank God, Frith came in to say that lunch was 
ready. Beatrice walked with me through the hall.

622
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:31,520
'You know,' she said, 'you are much younger than 
I expected. Tell me, do you love Maxim very much?'

623
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,800
Beatrice looked at my surprised face and laughed.

624
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,680
'Don't answer,' she said. 'I can see that 
you do. Maxim looks very well. We were all  

625
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,440
very worried about him last year. But 
of course, you know the whole story.'

626
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,480
But Beatrice was wrong. I did not know 
what had happened down in the bay.  

627
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,840
Maxim had told me nothing. I had 
never asked him about Rebecca's death.

628
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,040
Beatrice talked to Maxim all through lunch. 
Frank Crawley told me a lot about Manderley.  

629
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,920
I could see that he loved it as much as Maxim did.

630
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,840
When lunch was over, I could 
see that Maxim was tired.  

631
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,200
I wished we hadn't had visitors so soon. 
I took Beatrice out on to the terrace.  

632
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,280
She asked me how I had met Maxim. I told her about 
Mrs Van Hopper and how surprised she had been.

633
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,760
'It was rather a shock to us too,' Beatrice said. 
'Maxim said in his letter that you were very young  

634
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,680
and pretty. We expected a very modern sort of 
girl.' Beatrice laughed and I laughed with her.

635
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,320
'Poor Maxim. He had a terrible time,' Beatrice 
said. 'Let's hope you have made him forget all  

636
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,720
about it. He loves Manderley so much. 
But you never know what he is thinking.  

637
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,280
How do you get on with Mrs Danvers?'

638
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,160
I was surprised by Beatrice's question.

639
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,840
'She frightens me a little,' I said.

640
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,920
'She may try to make things 
unpleasant for you,' Beatrice went on.  

641
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,920
'She's very jealous, of course. 
She must hate you being here.'

642
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,840
'Why?' I asked. 'Why must she 
hate me being at Manderley?'

643
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,520
'My dear child,' Beatrice answered 
slowly, 'I thought Maxim had told you.  

644
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,440
Mrs Danvers adored Rebecca. She still does.'

645
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:22,000
At that moment, the men came out of the house. 
A servant brought rugs and chairs and we all sat  

646
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,320
under the great tree on the lawn. I hoped everyone 
would go soon. I wanted to be alone with Maxim.  

647
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,520
I was sitting on a rug, leaning against Maxim's 
chair. I listened to the others talking. The  

648
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,520
afternoon was sleepy and peaceful. Everything was 
quiet and still. Even the sea seemed far away.

649
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,840
This is what I wanted, I thought. This is 
how I thought life at Manderley would be.

650
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,200
This moment was safe. It could not be touched. 
Here we sat together, Maxim and I, hand in hand.  

651
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The past and the future did not matter 
at all. At this moment I was not afraid.

652
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,560
The moment passed. Beatrice stood up.

653
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,720
'We must be going,' she said. 
'We've got people coming to dinner.'  

654
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,680
We all got up and Giles looked up at the sky.

655
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,600
'I'm afraid we're going to have some rain,' he 
said. We all walked slowly back to the drive.

656
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,840
Beatrice took my hand. Then 
she bent down and kissed me.  

657
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,600
'Forgive me if I've asked you a 
lot of rude questions, my dear.  

658
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,360
As I said before, you are not what we expected. 
You are so very different from Rebecca.'

659
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,520
As we reached the car, the sun went behind 
a cloud and a little rain began to fall.  

660
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:57,840
Maxim and I watched the car drive away. We 
turned and walked back into the house.
 
 

661
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,040
CHAPTER EIGHT

662
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,720
The Happy Valley

663
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,240
As we stood in the hall, Maxim 
put his arm round my shoulders.

664
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,080
'Thank God that's over,' he said. 
'Get a coat quickly and let's go out.  

665
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,600
Never mind the rain, I want a walk.'

666
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,800
Maxim looked white and ill. Had Beatrice said 
something to make him angry? I could not remember.

667
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,280
'Just a moment,' I said. 'I'll 
get my coat from upstairs.'

668
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,800
'There are plenty of raincoats 
downstairs,' Maxim said.  

669
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,840
'Robert, will you fetch a coat for Mrs de Winter?'

670
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,760
Maxim was standing in the 
drive now, calling to Jasper.  

671
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,960
'Come on, you lazy little fellow. You're too fat.'

672
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:47,680
Jasper ran round in circles, barking loudly. 
The young servant, Robert, ran out of the hall,  

673
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,880
carrying a raincoat. I put it on quickly. 
It was too big, of course, and too long.  

674
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,880
But Maxim was waiting impatiently and 
there was no time to change the coat.  

675
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,920
We set off together across the lawns 
to the woods. Jasper ran on in front.

676
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,920
'I soon get tired of my family,' Maxim 
said. 'Beatrice is very kind-hearted,  

677
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,280
but she always says the wrong thing.'

678
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,080
I was not sure what Beatrice had said 
and I thought it better not to ask.

679
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,240
'What did you think of Beatrice?' Maxim asked 
me. 'What did she talk to you about after lunch?'

680
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,080
'I think I did most of the talking,' I said.  

681
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,440
'I was telling her about how we met. She said 
I was quite different from what she expected.'

682
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,920
'What on earth did she expect?'

683
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,880
'Someone much smarter, I 
think. A modern young woman.'

684
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,400
Maxim did not answer. He bent down and 
threw a stick for Jasper to run after.

685
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,880
We climbed the grass bank above the 
lawns and walked down into the woods.  

686
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,800
The trees grew very close together 
over our heads and it was very dark.  

687
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,640
We walked on last year's leaves. The green 
shoots of flowers were beginning to show through.  

688
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,920
Jasper was silent now, with 
his nose to the ground.

689
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,200
We came to a clearing in the woods. 
There were two paths, going in opposite  

690
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,840
directions. Jasper ran on ahead and took 
the right-hand path without waiting for us.

691
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,600
'Not that way,' called Maxim. 'Come on, old boy.'

692
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,320
The dog looked back at us. He 
stood there, wagging his tail.

693
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,360
'Why does he want to go that way?' I asked.

694
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,960
'I suppose he's used to it,' Maxim said quickly.  

695
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:32,160
'It leads to a small bay where we used to keep 
a boat. Come on, Jasper, old boy, this way.'

696
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,800
We turned on to the left-hand 
path, not saying anything.  

697
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,080
I looked over my shoulder and 
saw that Jasper was following us.

698
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,640
'This path brings us to the valley 
I told you about,' Maxim told me.  

699
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,600
'You can smell the flowers already. Never 
mind the rain, it will bring out the scent.'

700
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,000
Maxim seemed all right again now, happy 
and cheerful. He began talking about  

701
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,480
Frank Crawley. He told me what a good 
agent he was and how he loved Manderley.

702
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,160
I held Maxim's arm and looked up into his face.  

703
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,680
Talking about Manderley 
always made Maxim happy again.

704
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,560
We had reached the top of a small hill. 
The path ran down into a little valley,  

705
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,680
by the side of a stream.

706
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,360
'There,' said Maxim, 'look at that.'

707
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,240
There were no dark trees in this valley, no thick 
bushes. On either side of the narrow path stood  

708
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:28,240
high graceful bushes covered with flowers. 
The flowers were pink, white and gold. They  

709
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,240
were things of beauty and grace. The soft summer 
rain fell and the air was full of a sweet scent.  

710
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,600
There was no sound except for 
the noise of a little stream  

711
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,600
and the quiet rain on the leaves. When 
Maxim spoke, his voice was gentle and low.

712
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,280
'We call it the Happy Valley,' he said.

713
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,480
We stood still, not speaking. I looked down 
at the clear white flowers. Maxim picked up  

714
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,720
a fallen flower and gave it to me. As I rubbed it 
between my hands, the scent was sweet and strong.

715
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,720
A bird began to sing, a high, clear sound. 
Other birds began to sing too. I had never  

716
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,600
been in so beautiful a place. As we walked along 
the path, drops of rain fell on my hands and face.  

717
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,040
I held Maxim's hand. The Happy 
Valley was the heart of Manderley,  

718
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,320
the Manderley I would soon know and love.

CHAPTER NINE

720
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,840
The Cottage in the Bay

721
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,240
We came to the end of the path. The bushes made an 
arch over our heads so that we had to bend down.  

722
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:50,560
I stood straight again, brushing the rain from 
my head. I saw that the valley was behind us.  

723
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,960
We were standing in a little narrow bay. 
There, almost at our feet was the sea.

724
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,960
Maxim looked down at me, smiling 
at the surprise on my face.

725
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,840
'It is a surprise, isn't it?' he 
said. 'No one ever expects it.'

726
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,600
Maxim picked up a stone and threw 
it across the beach for Jasper.

727
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:15,760
'Fetch it, good boy,' he said. Jasper ran 
after the stone, barking with excitement.

728
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,520
We both went down to the water's edge and threw 
more stones. The tide was coming up into the  

729
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,560
bay and the water was beginning to cover the 
stones. Maxim turned to me, laughing and wiping  

730
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,680
the hair out of his eyes. I rolled up the long 
sleeves of the raincoat. It was a happy moment.

731
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Then we saw that Jasper had gone. We 
called and whistled, but he did not come.

732
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,040
'Has he gone back to the Happy Valley?' I asked.

733
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,600
'He was by that rock a minute ago,' said Maxim.

734
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
We walked up the beach towards the valley again.

735
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,040
'Jasper, Jasper,' called Maxim.

736
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,960
In the distance, beyond a line of rocks to 
the right of the beach, I heard a sharp bark.

737
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:02,720
'Do you hear that?' I said. 'He's gone over 
this way.' I began to climb up the wet rocks.

738
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,880
'Come back,' Maxim said sharply, 
'we don't want to go that way.'

739
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,240
'I must get him,' I said. 'He may be hurt.'

740
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,320
'He's all right,' said Maxim. 
'Leave him. He knows the way home.'

741
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,920
I began climbing over the rocks towards Jasper. 
I thought Maxim was being very unkind. I got to  

742
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,680
the top of the largest rock and looked beyond 
it. There was another bay. A small stone wall  

743
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:33,520
across the bay made it into a small harbour. In 
the bay was a green and white buoy, but no boat.

744
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,600
The woods came right down to the shore. At the 
edge of the woods was a low stone building,  

745
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,320
a cottage or a boat-house. There was a man 
standing on the shore, dressed like a fisherman.  

746
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,920
Jasper was barking at him and running round 
and round. The man took no notice of the dog.

747
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,160
'Jasper,' I shouted, 'Jasper, come here.'

748
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,400
The dog looked up, but he did not come to 
me. I looked back, but I could not see Maxim.  

749
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,160
I climbed down into the bay and the man looked at 
me for the first time. There was something strange  

750
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:13,200
about him. He had small, stupid looking eyes. His 
face was fat and round and he had thick, red lips.

751
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,400
'Bad weather, isn't it?' the 
man said with a stupid smile.

752
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,080
'It's not very nice weather,' I said. 
'Come on Jasper, we must go home now.'

753
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,880
But Jasper ran away, barking.

754
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,520
'Have you got any string?' I asked the 
man. 'I want something to tie the dog.  

755
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,400
He won't follow me.'

756
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,280
'I know that dog, it's not 
yours. It comes from the house.'

757
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,960
'He's Mr de Winter's dog,' I said 
kindly. 'I must take him back.'

758
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,520
The man said nothing, but stared 
at me in the same stupid way.

759
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,400
I walked up the shore to the cottage. 
Perhaps there was some string there.  

760
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,000
The grass round the little house had grown 
very long. The windows had pieces of wood  

761
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,840
over them. I pushed at the door. To my 
surprise it opened and I went inside.

762
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,520
The room was furnished and 
there were books on the shelves.

763
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,400
But everything was covered with thick 
dust. The air was damp and still.  

764
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,080
Another door at the end of the room led into a 
small boat-house. I saw some string on a shelf  

765
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,480
and an old knife. I cut a piece of string 
for Jasper and went out of the cottage.  

766
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,080
There was something frightening about that 
small, dark room. I was glad to be outside again.

767
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,840
The man was still watching 
me, staring like a child.  

768
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,440
Jasper was quiet now and let me tie the string.

769
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,080
'I saw you go in there,' the man said.  

770
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:51,440
'She doesn't go in there now. She's gone 
in the sea. She won't come back, will she?'

771
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,360
'No,' I said. 'She won't come back.'

772
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,440
'I didn't say anything, did I?' 
The man's eyes were full of fear.  

773
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,560
He turned away and walked back towards the sea.

774
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,600
Maxim was waiting for me beside 
the rocks. He looked angry.

775
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,760
'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I had to get some 
string for Jasper. Who is that man?'

776
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,760
'That's Ben. He's a bit mad, but he won't 
hurt you. Where did you get that string?'

777
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,520
'I found it in the cottage. The door was open.  

778
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,720
There's dust everywhere. The 
place ought to be cleaned.'

779
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,840
'The door should be locked,' Maxim 
said. He was walking very fast now.  

780
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,560
He went up past the cottage and on to 
a path through the woods. It was very  

781
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,280
different here from the Happy Valley. The path 
was steep and the trees were thick, and dark.  

782
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,360
It was cold now and my legs ached. Jasper 
was tired too, and walked very slowly.

783
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,280
'Come on, Jasper, for God's sake,'  

784
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,200
said Maxim angrily. 'Pull at that 
string, can't you?' he said to me.

785
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,640
'It's your fault,' I said, 'you walk so fast.'

786
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,400
'If you had listened to me,  

787
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,760
we would be home by now. There was 
no need for you to go after Jasper.'

788
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,720
'I thought you would come with me,' I answered.

789
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:14,160
'Why should I run after the damned 
dog?' Maxim said, not looking at me.

790
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,160
'That's an excuse. You didn't want 
to go over the rocks,' I answered.

791
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,280
'All right, I didn't. I didn't want 
to go to the other bay. I never  

792
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,880
go near the place or that damned 
cottage. If you had my memories,  

793
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,720
you would not go there either. You wouldn't 
talk about it or even think about it.'

794
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,680
Maxim's face was white. His eyes had a dark, 
lost look. I took his hand and held it tight.

795
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,240
'Please, Maxim, please,' I said. 'I 
don't want you to look like that.  

796
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,520
I'm sorry, darling. Please don't let us quarrel.'

797
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,360
'We should have stayed in Italy,' Maxim said. 
'I was a fool to bring you back to Manderley.'

798
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,040
I had to run to keep up with him now. At last 
we came to the top of the path and out on to  

799
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,480
the lawn. Maxim's face was hard. He walked 
straight into the house and spoke to Frith.

800
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,880
'We want tea at once,' said Maxim. Then he went 
quickly into the library and shut the door.

801
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,360
I tried to keep back my tears. Frith must not see  

802
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,480
them. I turned away as he helped me off with 
the raincoat. He picked up a handkerchief.

803
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,520
'Is this yours, Madam?' he said.

804
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,240
I put the handkerchief in my pocket and 
walked slowly across the hall to the library.  

805
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,080
Maxim was sitting in his usual 
chair, with Jasper at his feet.  

806
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,160
I walked across the room and 
knelt down by Maxim's chair.

807
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,840
'Don't be angry with me any more,' I said.

808
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,080
Maxim looked down at me.

809
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,280
'I'm not angry with you,' he said.

810
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:48,400
'But I've made you unhappy,' I replied. 'I 
want you to be happy so much. I love you.'

811
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,680
'Do you?' he said. His eyes 
were full of pain and fear.

812
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,920
'What is it, darling?' I said. 
'Why do you look like that?'

813
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:03,600
The door opened before Maxim could answer. 
It was Frith and Robert with the tea.  

814
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,520
The small table was put near the fire 
and covered with the white cloth.  

815
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,600
Frith brought in the silver teapot and kettle. 
Then came the cups, the sandwiches and cakes.  

816
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,000
Everything was the same as yesterday. 
When the servants had gone,  

817
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,040
I looked at Maxim's face. The colour had 
come back into it. He took a sandwich.

818
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:29,040
'Pour me a cup of tea, darling,' he said to 
me. 'And forgive me for being so unkind.'

819
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,040
There was nothing more to say. Maxim 
smiled at me and picked up his paper.  

820
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,200
Maxim's smile was like a pat 
on the head given to Jasper.

821
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,760
I was not hungry and I felt very tired. I 
gave Jasper a piece of cake and took out the  

822
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:52,000
handkerchief to wipe my hands. The handkerchief 
was not mine. It must have come from the raincoat  

823
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:00,080
pocket. There were some letters in the corner 
- a tall "R" and "de W." It was Rebecca's.  

824
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,640
The raincoat, too wide, too long 
for me, must have been hers too.  

825
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Rebecca had worn that raincoat. She had 
left the handkerchief in the pocket.  

826
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,840
I could smell a scent, a scent I knew. I shut 
my eyes and tried to remember what it was.

827
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:22,640
Suddenly I knew. The scent on the handkerchief 
was the scent of the flowers in the Happy Valley.  

828
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,840
Was there nowhere I could escape from Rebecca?
 
 

829
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,080
CHAPTER TEN

830
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,520
Questions and Answers

831
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,560
The weather was wet and cold for over a 
week. We did not go down to the beach again.  

832
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,280
I could see the sea from the terrace and 
the lawns. It looked cold and grey. When  

833
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,960
I stood on the terrace, I could hear 
the sound of great waves on the shore.  

834
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,920
I began to understand why some people 
hated the low, angry voice of the sea.  

835
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,000
I was glad that our rooms were in the east 
wing. If I could not sleep, I went to the  

836
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,280
window and looked out on to the rose-garden. 
I was not troubled by the sea's unhappy music.

837
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,520
Sometimes I thought about 
the cottage down in the bay.  

838
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,040
There were so many questions I wanted to 
ask Maxim. I could not forget the lost look  

839
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:35,280
in Maxim's eyes. I could not forget his words: 
'I was a fool to bring you back to Manderley.'

840
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,320
It was all my fault. I had gone down into the bay.  

841
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,800
I had reminded Maxim of the past. We 
lived our lives together sleeping,  

842
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,080
eating, walking. But, every hour of the 
day, the past made a wall between us.

843
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,240
I became nervous and afraid. I did not want 
anyone to talk about the sea or boats. When  

844
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:04,640
visitors came to Manderley, I was shy and awkward. 
I knew that they compared me with Rebecca. She  

845
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,920
had been charming, interested in everyone. 
I was dull and stupid, like a schoolgirl.

846
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,280
One afternoon, I was having tea alone 
when the wife of the bishop called.  

847
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,480
She was a kind woman and tried hard 
to make me talk. At last she said,

848
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,520
'Will your husband hold the 
Manderley Fancy Dress Ball this year?  

849
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:32,000
I remember the last one so well. It was such 
a lovely sight. I shall never forget it.'

850
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:38,160
I smiled and said, 'We have not decided. 
There have been so many things to do.'

851
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,880
I could not tell the woman that Maxim 
had never spoken about the ball.

852
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,600
'Manderley looked so beautiful,' 
the bishop's wife went on.  

853
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,320
'And there was dancing, and 
music and flowers everywhere.'

854
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,200
'Yes,' I said. 'Yes, I must ask Maxim about it.'

855
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:04,480
'We came to a garden-party too, one summer,' 
the bishop's wife went on. 'It was a lovely day.  

856
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:11,360
We all had tea in the rose-garden. It was such a 
clever idea. Of course, she was a clever person.'

857
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,320
She stopped, her face rather 
red. I heard myself saying,  

858
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,120
'Rebecca must have been a wonderful person...'

859
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,280
I had said her name at last. 
'Rebecca.' I had said it aloud.

860
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,600
'You never met her then?'  

861
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:34,720
the woman asked. 'Yes, she was a lovely 
person. So full of life. Everyone loved her.'

862
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,800
'She was so good at everything too,' I 
said. 'Clever, beautiful and fond of sport.'

863
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,320
'Rebecca was certainly beautiful,' my visitor 
went on. 'I remember her on the night of the Ball.  

864
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:54,320
She had a cloud of dark hair. Her skin was 
very white. And she had such a lovely dress.'

865
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,840
'She looked after everything in the house, too,'  

866
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,880
I said. 'I'm afraid I leave 
it all to the housekeeper.'

867
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,160
'Oh well, you are very young, aren't 
you? We can't all do everything.  

868
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,760
I must go now. Do ask your 
husband to have another ball.'

869
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,160
'Yes, of course I will.'

870
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,560
I sat in the library after my visitor had gone.  

871
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,720
I thought about Manderley, full of people in 
beautiful costumes, dancing in the hall. I thought  

872
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:30,640
of Rebecca, lively and beautiful, arranging 
everything. What must people think about me?

873
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:39,840
I suddenly sat up straight. I did not mind. I did 
not care. I was Mrs de Winter now, not Rebecca.  

874
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,920
I decided that I would find out more about the 
Fancy Dress Ball. But I did not want to ask Maxim.

875
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,400
Later that afternoon, Frank 
Crawley came up to the house.

876
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,080
'I have been hearing about the Fancy Dress Ball,  

877
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,440
Frank,' I said. 'I did not 
know you had dances here.'

878
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:04,880
Frank did not reply at once. Then he said, 
'The Manderley Ball was held every year.  

879
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,080
People came from miles around. 
They even came down from London.'

880
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,800
'It must have been a lot of work,' I 
said. 'I suppose Rebecca did most of it.'

881
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,040
Frank looked straight ahead.

882
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,080
'We all helped,' he said.

883
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,920
'Will you ask Maxim about the Ball?' 
I asked. 'It does seem a good idea.'

884
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,640
Frank did not answer me.

885
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,840
'I went into that cottage in 
the bay a few days ago,' I said.  

886
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,840
'It's very dirty. Why doesn't 
someone do something about it?'

887
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,120
'Maxim would tell me if he wanted 
anything done,' Frank replied.

888
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,400
'Are they Rebecca's things?' I asked.

889
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,720
'Yes,' Frank said.

890
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,240
'Did Rebecca use the cottage a lot?'

891
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:58,160
'Yes, she did. She slept in the cottage sometimes. 
She had moonlight picnics on the shore.'

892
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,080
I noticed that Frank always called 
Rebecca 'she'. He never used her name.

893
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,480
'Why is there a buoy in the bay?' I asked. 
'There's no boat there. What happened to it?  

894
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,680
Was it the boat Rebecca 
was sailing when she died?'

895
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,000
'Yes,' said Frank, quietly. 
'It turned over and sank.  

896
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,880
She was washed overboard and drowned. The 
sea is sometimes very rough in the bay.'

897
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,720
'Couldn't anyone have helped her?' I asked.

898
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,760
'Nobody saw the accident. Nobody knew she was 
sailing. She often went out alone like that.'

899
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,360
'When did they find her?' I 
felt I must know everything now.  

900
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,760
I had been thinking about that 
terrible night for so long.

901
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:50,080
'They found her two months later. The sea 
had carried her forty miles up the coast.  

902
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,640
Maxim had to identify the body.'

903
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,160
Suddenly I was ashamed of all my questions.

904
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,720
'Frank,' I said, 'I'm sorry I asked you 
all those questions. But everything is so  

905
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:07,840
strange to me at Manderley. And when I meet 
anyone new, I know what they are thinking:  

906
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,440
"How different she is from Rebecca." '

907
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,400
'Mrs de Winter, you mustn't think that,' 
said Frank, looking at me for the first time.  

908
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,000
'I am so glad you have married Maxim. It 
will make such a difference to his life.  

909
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,200
And Manderley needs someone like you, 
someone young, fresh and charming.'

910
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,680
'But Rebecca was so charming - and 
clever. People still remember her.'

911
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,720
'Maxim would be very unhappy to hear you talking 
like this, Mrs de Winter. Forget the past, as  

912
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:46,800
Maxim has done. None of us want to bring back the 
past. Your job here is to lead us away from it.'

913
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,480
I was much happier now. But I had 
to ask Frank one more question.

914
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,840
Tell me, Frank,' I said. 
'Was Rebecca very beautiful?'

915
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,440
Frank turned away from me so 
that I could not see his face.

916
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:11,840
'Yes,' he said slowly. 'Yes, I suppose she was 
the most beautiful woman I ever saw in my life.'
 
 

917
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,880
CHAPTER ELEVEN

918
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,720
The China Cupid

919
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,440
Frank had told me to forget the past. I wanted 
to. But Frank did not sit in the morning room  

920
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,320
every day as I did. He did not sit at Rebecca's 
desk and touch the things she had touched.  

921
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,560
Dear God, I did not want to think about 
Rebecca. I wanted to be happy. I wanted  

922
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,040
Maxim to be happy too. But Rebecca 
was always in my thoughts and dreams.

923
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,880
Beatrice, Maxim's sister, had promised to give me 
a wedding present. She did not forget. One day,  

924
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,840
Robert brought a large parcel into the 
morning-room where I was sitting alone.  

925
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:41,920
I cut the string excitedly and tore off the 
dark brown paper. Beatrice had sent me four  

926
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,600
big books about painting. She knew that I enjoyed 
sketching and she had really tried to please me.

927
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,680
I was glad to have something at Manderley that 
belonged to me. I looked round the room for  

928
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,320
somewhere to put the books. I stood them in 
a row on top of the desk and looked at them.  

929
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:05,120
But the books were far too heavy. First one 
fell and then the others followed. A little  

930
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:10,320
china ornament which always stood on the desk was 
knocked on to the floor. The ornament broke into  

931
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,600
many pieces. It was a beautiful little cupid 
and one of the loveliest things in the house.  

932
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,400
I was suddenly very frightened. I found an 
envelope in a drawer and carefully put the  

933
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,680
pieces of china into it. Then, like a 
child, I hid the envelope in the desk.  

934
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,720
I decided to put my new books in the 
library and I said nothing about the cupid.

935
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,400
The following day, after lunch, Frith 
brought our coffee to the library as usual.  

936
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,520
Instead of leaving, he stood by Maxim's chair.

937
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:47,360
'Could I speak to you, sir?' he 
said. Maxim looked up from his paper.

938
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,360
'Yes, Frith, what is it?'

939
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:57,280
'It's about Robert, sir. He's very upset. Mrs 
Danvers has accused him of taking a valuable  

940
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,240
ornament from the morning-room. Mrs Danvers 
noticed it was missing late this morning.  

941
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,640
She says that Robert must have taken it or broken 
it. Robert says he knows nothing about it.'

942
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,400
'Perhaps it was one of the maids,' said Maxim.  

943
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,600
I knew he hated any kind of 
trouble with the servants.

944
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,680
'No, sir. No one except 
Robert has been in the room,  

945
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:24,800
apart from Madam, of course. Mrs Danvers 
doesn't let the maids clean the morning-room.'

946
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,800
'Well, Mrs Danvers had better come 
and see me. What ornament was it?'

947
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,360
'The china cupid, sir. It stands on the desk.'

948
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:42,880
'Oh dear,' said Maxim. 'That's very valuable. 
It must be found. I'll see Mrs Danvers at once.'

949
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,440
'Very good, sir,' said Frith 
and quietly left the room.

950
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,600
'Darling,' I said to Maxim when we were alone,  

951
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,640
'I meant to tell you before, but I 
forgot. I broke the cupid yesterday.'

952
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,480
'You broke it?  

953
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,520
Why didn't you say so when Frith was here? 
You'll have to explain to Mrs Danvers now.'

954
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,480
'Oh no. Please, Maxim, you 
tell her. Let me go upstairs.'

955
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,840
'Don't be silly,' said Maxim angrily. 'Anyone 
would think you were afraid of Mrs Danvers.'

956
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,840
'I am afraid of her. At least not afraid, but...'

957
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,160
The door opened without a sound 
and Mrs Danvers came into the room.  

958
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,600
I looked nervously at Maxim. His 
face was half amused, half angry.

959
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,360
'It's all a mistake, Mrs Danvers,'  

960
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:37,920
Maxim told her. 'Mrs de Winter broke the 
cupid herself. She forgot to tell us.'

961
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,280
I felt like a child again.

962
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,560
'I'm so sorry,' I said, 'I never 
thought Robert would get into trouble.'

963
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,640
'Is it possible to repair the cupid, Madam?'  

964
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:55,520
said Mrs Danvers. She did not seem surprised. 
I felt she had known the truth all the time.

965
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,400
'I'm afraid not,' I said. 
'It's in hundreds of pieces.'

966
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,080
'What did you do with the pieces?' said Maxim.

967
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,840
They are in an envelope in a 
drawer of the writing desk.'

968
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,480
'Find the pieces, Mrs Danvers. 
Try to get them mended in London.'

969
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,440
'I never thought that Mrs de 
Winter had broken the ornament,'  

970
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:22,720
said Mrs Danvers. As she left the room I 
could see the scorn and hatred in her eyes.

971
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,560
'I'm very sorry, darling,' I said. 'It 
was very silly and careless of me.'

972
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,160
'Forget it,' said Maxim. 'But 
you do act strangely sometimes.  

973
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,560
More like a servant than 
the mistress of Manderley.  

974
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,840
Even when we have visitors, you sit on the edge 
of your chair and say only "yes" and "no".'

975
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,160
'I can't help being shy.'

976
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,160
'I know you can't, darling. 
But you must learn to hide it.'

977
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:55,440
'I do try. But I'm not used to this kind of life. 
People look at me and ask me so many questions.'

978
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,680
'What does it matter? They are 
interested in us, that's all.'

979
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,120
'They can't find me very interesting,' I 
said. 'I suppose that's why you married  

980
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,600
me. You knew I was dull and quiet. 
No one would ever gossip about me.'

981
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,520
Maxim threw his paper on the 
ground and got up from his chair.  

982
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,120
His face was dark with anger 
and his voice was hard.

983
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,480
'What do you know about any gossip down 
here?' he said. 'Who's been talking to you?'

984
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,800
'No one. No one at all.'

985
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,120
Maxim stared at me.

986
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,840
'Perhaps I did a very selfish 
thing when I married you,'  

987
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,160
he said slowly. 'I am so much older than you.'

988
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,120
I felt cold and frightened.

989
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:46,640
'Age doesn't matter,' I said. 'I'm happy. You know 
I love you more than anything else in the world.  

990
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,320
I love Manderley too. I love everything 
here. You're happy too, darling, aren't you?'

991
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,840
Maxim did not answer. He stood 
staring out of the window.

992
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,840
'If you don't think we're happy, you must tell 
me,' I went on. 'I don't want you to lie to me.'

993
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,960
Maxim took my face in his hands.

994
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,840
'How can I answer you?' he said. 'If 
you are happy, then we are both happy.'

995
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,200
He kissed me and walked across the room.

996
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,480
'But you are disappointed in me. You 
think I am not right for Manderley.  

997
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:27,200
If only I hadn't broken that 
cupid. Was it very valuable?'

998
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:35,120
'I think so,' Maxim answered. 'It was a wedding 
present. Rebecca knew a lot about china.'

999
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,320
Maxim went on staring straight in front of him.

1000
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,120
He is thinking about Rebecca, I said to myself. 
I have broken one of their wedding presents.

1001
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:52,240
Maxim went back to his chair and picked up his 
paper. I sat on the long seat under the window.  

1002
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:07,840
After a time, Jasper came to 
me and climbed on to my lap.
 
 

1003
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,040
CHAPTER TWELVE

1004
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,640
In the West Wing

1005
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:23,920
Maxim had to go up to London at the end of June. 
It was the first time that I had been left alone  

1006
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,200
at Manderley. I was sure that Maxim would 
have a terrible accident or even be killed.  

1007
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:36,000
I was too worried to eat any lunch. At about two 
o'clock, Robert brought me a message. Maxim had  

1008
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,160
arrived safely in London after a good journey. 
I felt happy again and also rather hungry.  

1009
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,080
I went back into the dining-room 
and took an apple and some biscuits.  

1010
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,840
Then I called Jasper and we 
went together into the woods.

1011
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,240
As I sat there I felt happier 
than I had ever been at Manderley.  

1012
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,640
I could not understand it. I had not wanted Maxim 
to go to London, but now I was glad to be alone.

1013
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,000
I walked through the Happy Valley 
to the bay. The sea was very calm.  

1014
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,040
Jasper ran up the rocks leading to the next bay.

1015
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,840
'Not that way, Jasper,' I 
called. The dog took no notice.

1016
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:20,880
Oh well, it doesn't matter, I thought. Maxim isn't 
here. And I climbed over the rocks after Jasper.

1017
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,800
The tide was out and there was 
very little water in the bay.  

1018
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,760
The white and green buoy was still 
there. I could read the name on it now:  

1019
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:38,240
Je Reviens. A strange name for a boat - "I'll come 
back". And that boat would never come back now.

1020
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,800
I walked slowly across the beach to the cottage. 
The sun was shining today and the cottage did  

1021
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:50,320
not look frightening any more. I pushed open 
the door. Everything was exactly as before.  

1022
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,840
There was a sound in the boat-house and 
Jasper ran up to the doorway, barking angrily.

1023
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,800
'Is anybody there?' I said.

1024
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,000
I looked through the door and saw Ben sitting 
by the wall. He looked very frightened.

1025
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,160
'I think you should come out,' I said. 'Mr de 
Winter doesn't like people coming in here.'

1026
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,840
Ben followed me out into the sunshine.

1027
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,520
'I'm not doing anything wrong,' he 
said. 'You won't lock me up, will you?'

1028
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,880
His whole body was shaking with fear and 
tears were rolling down his fat, round face.

1029
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,760
'I didn't do anything. I 
didn't tell anyone,' he said.

1030
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:35,760
'That's all right, Ben. No one's going to hurt 
you. But don't go into the cottage again.'

1031
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,680
Ben smiled.

1032
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:46,160
'You're not like the other one,' he said. 'She 
was tall and dark. She had eyes like a snake.  

1033
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,280
She came here at night. She 
saw me once, looking at her.  

1034
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:58,480
"You'll be locked up. People will hurt you," 
she said. But you won't lock me up, will you?'

1035
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,360
'No, of course not, Ben,' I said.

1036
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,280
Ben smiled again and went off 
down the beach to the sea.  

1037
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:12,960
I went up towards the wood. Jasper followed me. 
When I looked back, Ben had gone. But I had a  

1038
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:20,080
strange feeling that someone was watching me. 
Someone tall and dark, who watched and listened.

1039
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,960
I started to run up the path and did not feel safe 
until I reached the lawn. The house stood there,  

1040
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:33,440
safe and secure. The sun shone on something metal 
in the drive. A green sports car was parked there.  

1041
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:38,000
I had never seen it before and I hoped 
the visitor did not want to stay to tea.

1042
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:44,720
As I walked across the lawn, I looked up at the 
west wing. One of the shutters was open and a  

1043
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:50,560
man stood at the window. Then another figure, 
dressed in black, closed the shutter. I was sure  

1044
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,320
it was Mrs Danvers. But who was the man? And 
why had he come when Maxim was away in London?

1045
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,960
I walked up the steps, through the 
hall and into the morning-room.  

1046
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:06,720
I could smell cigarette smoke. Then I heard voices 
and, without thinking, I hid behind the door.  

1047
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:13,120
I heard Mrs Danvers say, 'I expect she went 
into the library. Wait here while I go and see.'

1048
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,000
She was talking about me of course.  

1049
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,360
I did not know what to do. Jasper had moved 
towards the drawing-room, wagging his tail.

1050
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,960
'Hallo, Jasper, old boy,' said a man's voice 
and Jasper ran back into the morning-room.  

1051
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:34,240
The man followed. He saw me standing behind the 
door. I have never seen anyone more surprised.

1052
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:40,720
'I beg your pardon,' the man said, looking down at 
me with a rather unpleasant smile. He was a big,  

1053
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:46,640
handsome man, but his face was red and his eyes 
were a hard blue. His breath smelt of whisky.

1054
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:52,560
'I'm so sorry,' he said. 'I called to 
see Danny. She's an old friend of mine.'

1055
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,360
He lit a cigarette and looked round the room.

1056
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,080
'How's old Max?' he asked.

1057
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,840
'Maxim's very well, he's in London,' I said.

1058
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:08,400
'What? He's left you all alone? That's not 
fair, is it?' The man gave an unpleasant laugh.  

1059
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,080
I did not like him at all.

1060
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,160
At that moment, Mrs Danvers came 
back. She looked at me angrily.

1061
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:21,040
'Well, Danny,' the man said, 'aren't you 
going to introduce me to the new bride?'

1062
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,280
'This is Mr Favell, Madam,' said Mrs Danvers.

1063
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,840
'How do you do?' I said 
politely. 'Will you stay to tea?'

1064
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,600
The man laughed again.

1065
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,200
'Now isn't that kind, Danny,' he 
said. 'But I had better be going.  

1066
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:43,840
Come and look at my car,' he said to me. 'It's 
a good car. Much faster than the one Max has.'

1067
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,880
I did not like the way that Favell spoke about 
Maxim. I did not want to look at his car.  

1068
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,040
But I followed him out into the hall.

1069
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,840
'Goodbye, Danny. Take care of yourself. 
You know my telephone number.'

1070
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,640
'Dear old Manderley,' Favell said 
as we walked out of the house.  

1071
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,160
'What do you think of it? 
Aren't you lonely living here?'

1072
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,280
'I'm very fond of Manderley,' I said.

1073
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,840
'I have enjoyed meeting you,' 
Favell said, standing by his car.  

1074
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,280
'But I'd rather you didn't 
tell Max about my visit.  

1075
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:21,280
I'm afraid your husband doesn't like me very 
much. He might be cross with poor old Danny.'

1076
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:27,920
'No, all right,' I said awkwardly. 
'I won't say anything to Maxim.'

1077
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,040
He got into the car and started the engine.

1078
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,880
'That's very kind,' he said. 'Perhaps I'll 
come back and see you one day. Goodbye.'

1079
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:44,560
Favell drove away noisily and much too fast. I 
walked slowly back to the house. Mrs Danvers had  

1080
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:51,440
gone. I wondered who Favell was. He had certainly 
been to Manderley before. And, like Rebecca,  

1081
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:57,760
he called Maxim 'Max'. Had Favell known Rebecca? 
What had he been doing in the west wing?  

1082
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,920
There were some very valuable things in 
the house. Perhaps the man was a thief.

1083
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:08,560
I decided to go up to the west wing. I must see 
that everything was all right. The house seemed  

1084
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,080
very quiet as I began to walk up the stairs. 
My heart was beating in a strange, excited way.

1085
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,840
I was again in the corridor where I had stood on 
my first morning at Manderley. I turned the handle  

1086
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,760
of the nearest door and went inside. Everything 
was dark. I found the light and switched it on.  

1087
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,880
I was surprised to see that the room was 
completely furnished. There was no dust  

1088
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:39,200
and everything was clean and tidy. The room, a 
bedroom, was the most beautiful I had ever seen.  

1089
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:43,760
There were flowers on the dressing 
table and on the table beside the bed.  

1090
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:49,840
A satin dressing-gown lay on a chair. 
There was a pair of slippers under a chair.

1091
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:57,200
I walked slowly into the middle of the room. No, 
it was not used. It was not lived in any more.  

1092
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:03,840
The air was not fresh. Rebecca would 
never come back to this room again.  

1093
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,080
I could hear the sea clearly. I went 
to the window and opened a shutter.  

1094
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,200
Yes, I was standing at the window where 
I had seen Mrs Danvers and Favell.

1095
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,080
I felt afraid and my legs began to tremble. I 
sat down on the stool by the dressing-table.  

1096
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:26,080
I looked round the room, the most beautiful 
in Manderley. A room that was never used now.

1097
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,080
I got up and went to the chair. I 
touched the satin dressing-gown.  

1098
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,320
I picked up the slippers and held them in my hand.

1099
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,600
On the bed lay Rebecca's 
nightdress. I went to the bed  

1100
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:45,840
and held the nightdress to my face. It was cold 
and smelt of the flowers in the Happy Valley.

1101
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,680
As I stood looking down at the 
bed, I heard a step behind me.

1102
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,720
I turned quickly. It was Mrs Danvers.  

1103
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:59,840
I shall never forget the look on her face. It 
was a look of strange, terrible excitement.

1104
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,440
She came nearer and I could 
feel her breath on my face.

1105
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:11,520
'Is there anything the matter, Madam? Are you 
feeling unwell?' Mrs Danvers said quietly.

1106
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:18,240
'I did not expect to see you here, Mrs Danvers. 
I came up to fasten one of the shutters.'

1107
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,480
'I will fasten it,' Mrs Danvers said.

1108
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,400
Mrs Danvers came back from the 
window and stood beside me.

1109
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,680
'You opened the shutter yourself, didn't you?' she 
said. 'You wanted to see this room, didn't you?  

1110
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,520
Now you are here, let me show you everything.'

1111
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,840
Her voice now was as soft and sweet as honey.

1112
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:50,640
'It's a lovely room, isn't it? That was her bed. 
I keep it just as it was. This was her nightdress.  

1113
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,840
She was wearing it the night before 
she died. These are her slippers.'

1114
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,360
Mrs Danvers put the slippers back under the chair 
and walked across the room to a large wardrobe.

1115
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,760
'All her evening clothes are here. Her furs,  

1116
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,640
too. Mr de Winter was always buying 
clothes for her, beautiful clothes.'

1117
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,760
Mrs Danvers held my arm tightly with her long 
thin fingers. Her eyes looked deep into mine.

1118
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:26,480
'I blame myself for the accident,' she said. 
'I was out that evening. When I came in,  

1119
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:32,320
I heard she had gone down to the bay. I 
was worried. The wind was blowing hard.  

1120
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,360
Mr de Winter came in at about eleven. The wind was 
blowing harder, and still she had not come back.

1121
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,120
'I sat on my bed until after five. Then I 
put on my coat and went down to the bay.  

1122
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,680
I saw at once that the boat had gone.'

1123
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,160
Mrs Danvers' hand fell back to her side.

1124
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:56,960
'That is why Mr de Winter doesn't use 
these rooms any more. Listen to the sea.'

1125
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:03,760
Even with the shutters and windows closed, I could 
hear the dull, harsh sound of the sea in the bay.

1126
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,200
'I come into these room and dust 
them every day,' Mrs Danvers said.  

1127
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,320
'If you want to come again, ask 
me. No one comes here but me.

1128
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,880
'Sometimes I feel she is standing here, behind me.  

1129
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:26,560
I feel her everywhere. In the morning-room 
and in the hall. You feel her too, don't you?'

1130
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,680
I tried to smile, but I felt sick and ill.

1131
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,040
'Do you think she can see us  

1132
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:40,720
now?' Mrs Danvers asked me. 'Do you 
think the dead watch the living?'

1133
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,960
'I don't know,' I said. 'I don't know.'

1134
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:53,440
'Sometimes I think she watches you and Mr 
de Winter together,' Mrs Danvers whispered.

1135
01:37:54,720 --> 01:38:00,080
We stood there by the door, staring at one 
another. I could not take my eyes away from hers.  

1136
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:06,000
Then I turned and walked into the corridor. I went 
down the stairs and through the door to the east  

1137
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,120
wing. I pushed open the door to my own bedroom. 
I shut the door of the room and locked it.

1138
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:29,840
Then I lay down on my bed and closed 
my eyes. I felt terribly sick.
 
 

1139
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,720
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1140
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,720
More About Jack Favell

1141
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,960
Maxim rang up the next morning. I heard 
the phone ring while I was having breakfast  

1142
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,520
and Frith answered it. I hoped that 
Maxim would ask for me but he did not.

1143
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,720
'Mr de Winter will be back at about 
six this evening,' Frith told me.

1144
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,920
'All right, Frith. Thank you,' I said.

1145
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:03,120
I went on eating breakfast as slowly as I could. 
Jasper was sitting at my feet. I wondered what  

1146
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:08,800
I should do all day. I had slept badly. I 
could not forget my visit to the west wing.  

1147
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,240
I knew now how much Mrs Danvers hated me.

1148
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:17,600
About ten o'clock, the telephone rang 
again. This time it was Beatrice.

1149
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:22,880
'Well, my dear, how are you?' she said. 
'Shall I come and have lunch with you today?'

1150
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,560
'I'd like you to come very 
much, Beatrice,' I said.

1151
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,120
'All right, my dear. See you later.'

1152
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:37,520
I put the phone down. I was glad that Beatrice was 
coming. It gave me something to look forward to. I  

1153
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:43,200
wandered out on to the lawn. I felt different 
from yesterday. I wanted Maxim to come home.

1154
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:49,440
I tried not to remember my visit to the west wing. 
But I could not stop thinking about Favell and his  

1155
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:55,920
friendship with Mrs Danvers. I began to feel that 
Mrs Danvers was watching me. There were so many  

1156
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:01,280
rooms that Maxim and I never used. It was easy for 
Mrs Danvers to watch me from one of their windows.

1157
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:07,840
Beatrice arrived by car at about half past twelve. 
This time I went out to the drive to meet her.

1158
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,120
'Well, my dear, here I am,' she 
said. 'It's a lovely day, isn't it?'

1159
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,160
She gave me a kiss and then 
looked at me carefully.

1160
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:22,160
'You don't look well,' Beatrice said. 
'You are much too thin. Your face is pale,  

1161
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:23,520
too. What's wrong with you?'

1162
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,360
'Nothing,' I said. 'My face is always pale.'

1163
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:30,640
'You looked quite different 
when I saw you before,'  

1164
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,520
Beatrice told me. 'You are not 
going to have a baby, are you?'

1165
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,320
'No, I don't think so,' I said.

1166
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,880
'Well, I hope you will sometime. 
Maxim would be so happy to have a son.  

1167
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:44,880
What have you been doing with 
yourself? Have you done much sketching?  

1168
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,760
Did you like the books I sent 
you? Have you had anyone to stay?'

1169
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,000
I had forgotten that Beatrice 
asked so many questions.

1170
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,880
'No, we've had no one to stay. People 
come to tea sometimes, of course.'

1171
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:03,280
I wondered whether to tell Beatrice about 
Mrs Danvers' visitor, Favell. I did not want  

1172
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,760
Beatrice to tell Maxim about the visit. But 
I did want to find out more about the man.

1173
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,560
'Have you ever heard of a man called 
Jack Favell, Beatrice?' I asked her.

1174
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:22,720
'Jack Favell?' said Beatrice slowly. 'Yes, I do 
know the name. Wait a minute - Jack Favell. Yes,  

1175
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:27,840
of course. I remember him now. He's an 
awful man. I met him once, years ago.'

1176
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:32,800
'He was here yesterday,' I told 
her. 'He came to see Mrs Danvers.'

1177
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,960
Beatrice did not look at me.

1178
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,440
'Oh well,' she said, 'I suppose 
he knows Mrs Danvers quite well.'

1179
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,840
'But why?' I asked.

1180
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,160
'Jack Favell is Rebecca's cousin,'  

1181
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,080
Beatrice said. 'I think he came to Manderley 
quite a lot when Rebecca was alive. I'm not sure.'

1182
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,200
'I did not like him,' I said.

1183
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:57,200
'No, I don't suppose that 
you did,' Beatrice answered.

1184
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,800
I hoped that she would tell me more about Favell,  

1185
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,320
but she did not. For the rest of the 
time we talked about other things.

1186
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,840
Beatrice stayed for tea and left soon afterwards.  

1187
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,880
She had promised to meet her 
husband, Giles, at the station.

1188
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,560
'I hope you won't be so thin next time I see 
you,' Beatrice said as she got into her car.  

1189
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:21,040
'Give Maxim my love. Look after 
him, and look after yourself, too.'

1190
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:28,000
I watched Beatrice's car go down the drive. 
Maxim would not be back for another hour.  

1191
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,160
I did not feel like sitting 
in the house by myself.  

1192
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:35,200
I called Jasper and we went for a walk through 
the woods. But I did not go near the sea.  

1193
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:41,840
I missed Maxim now and felt lonely without him. 
Beatrice's questions had made me feel tired too.

1194
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,720
When I came back from my walk, I saw 
Maxim's car standing in front of the house.  

1195
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:51,920
At once, I felt much happier. I ran 
quickly up the steps and into the hall.  

1196
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:56,320
As I walked towards the library, 
I heard the sound of voices.  

1197
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:02,800
One voice was Maxim's, very loud and angry. The 
door was shut, but I could hear what he said.

1198
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,560
'You can tell Favell to keep away from 
Manderley. Tell him I said so,' Maxim was saying.

1199
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:13,520
'I know he was here. Never mind who told 
me. His car was seen here yesterday.  

1200
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,320
If you want to meet him, meet him somewhere 
else. I don't want that man at Manderley.  

1201
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,600
I won't even have him in the gardens. 
I'm telling you for the last time.'

1202
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,560
I heard footsteps. I ran quickly 
up the stairs and hid myself.

1203
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:31,440
Mrs Danvers came out of the library. She 
shut the door and walked up the stairs.  

1204
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,520
Her face was grey with anger and 
the look in her eyes frightened me.  

1205
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,200
Thank God she did not know I was watching her. Mrs 
Danvers went through the door to the west wing.

1206
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,520
I waited a moment and then went 
downstairs and into the library.  

1207
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,720
Maxim was standing by the window. When he 
heard the door open, he turned round quickly.

1208
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,360
I smiled and held out my hand to him.

1209
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,080
'Oh, it's you,' Maxim said.

1210
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:02,400
I could tell that he was very angry. His face was 
white and his mouth hard. I took his hand in mine.

1211
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,640
'I missed you so much,' I said. 
'I hate being here without you.'

1212
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:12,560
'Do you?' Maxim said. He did not say 
anything about Mrs Danvers or Favell.

1213
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,320
'Are you worried about something?' I asked.

1214
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,480
'I've had a long day,' Maxim answered. 
'And London was very hot and noisy.  

1215
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,600
I always hate going there.'

1216
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:30,560
Maxim lit a cigarette and moved away from me. I 
knew then that he was not going to tell me about  

1217
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:36,320
his anger with Mrs Danvers. Maxim still thought 
of me as a child - someone who must not hear  

1218
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:42,480
unpleasant things. But he was wrong. I felt 
I was growing up a little more every day.  

1219
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,840
My life at Manderley was 
turning me into a woman.
 
 

1220
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:55,680
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1221
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,760
Preparations for the Ball

1222
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,080
It was on a Sunday afternoon when someone 
spoke about the Fancy Dress Ball again.  

1223
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,280
Frank Crawley had come to lunch and the three 
of us were hoping to have a quiet afternoon.  

1224
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,840
But as we were walking out to the big tree on 
the lawn, we heard a car in the drive. We had  

1225
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:22,000
to go back into the house to welcome the visitors. 
Very soon, more people arrived and then some more.

1226
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:28,720
They all stayed to tea, of course. As we sat 
in the drawing-room eating cake and sandwiches,  

1227
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:32,960
one of our visitors suddenly 
said to Maxim, 'Oh, Mr de Winter.  

1228
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,600
There is something I must ask you. Are you having 
a Fancy Dress Ball at Manderley this year?'

1229
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,160
Maxim answered quietly.

1230
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:45,680
'I haven't thought about it,' he said. 'And 
I don't think anyone else has, either.'

1231
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,720
'Oh, but you are wrong,' said another 
woman. 'We have all been thinking about it.  

1232
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,440
We used to enjoy the Manderley Ball so much.'

1233
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,640
'Well, I don't know,' said Maxim. 
'There would be a great deal to do.  

1234
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,880
You had better ask Frank Crawley. 
He would do most of the work.'

1235
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:11,840
'I don't mind the work,' said Frank, looking at 
me. 'It's for Maxim and Mrs de Winter to decide.'

1236
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,720
Everyone looked at me and started to talk at once.

1237
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,000
'Now, Mrs de Winter, you must help 
us. Your husband will listen to you.  

1238
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,040
After all, you are a new bride. 
The Ball will be for you.'

1239
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,800
'Yes, of course,' said a man, 'we all missed your  

1240
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,080
wedding. There ought to be some 
kind of party here at Manderley.'

1241
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,200
Everyone laughed and clapped their hands.

1242
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,440
Maxim looked at me.

1243
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,840
'What about you? Would you like it?' he said.

1244
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:45,520
I did not know what Maxim was thinking. Perhaps 
he thought I was too shy to want the Ball.

1245
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,080
'I think I rather like the 
idea,' I said with a smile.

1246
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,080
Maxim turned away.

1247
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:57,360
'All right, then, Frank. We'll have 
the dance. Mrs Danvers can help you.  

1248
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:03,200
She will know what to do. Now, if we've all 
finished tea, we'll go into the garden.'

1249
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:09,520
We all went outside. Our visitors were talking 
happily now about their costumes for the Ball.  

1250
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,520
I felt excited too.

1251
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,800
'What will you wear?' I said to Maxim.

1252
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:21,840
'I never wear fancy dress,' Maxim replied. 
'I'm the host, so I can do as I like.'

1253
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,680
'What shall I wear?' I 
said. 'I've no idea at all.'

1254
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,760
Maxim smiled at me.

1255
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,840
'If you look pretty, I don't mind 
what you put on,' he told me.

1256
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:37,840
'All right,' I said. 'My costume will be 
a secret. I shall keep it as a surprise.'

1257
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:44,240
Maxim laughed and patted me on the shoulder. 
As usual, he was treating me like a child.  

1258
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:49,840
I did not want to be a child. I 
wanted to be a grown-up woman.

1259
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,200
I shall wear a beautiful dress 
at the Ball, I told myself.  

1260
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,280
Everyone will say how charming I am. They will 
think of me as the real Mrs de Winter at last.  

1261
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,840
Maxim will love me as his 
wife and forget about Rebecca.

1262
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,600
Soon everyone at Manderley was 
talking about the Fancy Dress Ball.  

1263
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,400
My little maid, Clarice, spoke of nothing else.

1264
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:18,560
'Oh, Madam, it's so exciting,' she said. 
'I'm looking forward to it so much.'

1265
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,320
The preparations went on. Frank was 
very busy and so was Mrs Danvers.  

1266
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,280
I saw very little of her, and I was glad.

1267
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:32,320
I began to get worried about my 
costume. I did not know what to wear.  

1268
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:38,160
I looked through the books that Beatrice had 
given me. I made sketches of some of the costumes,  

1269
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:43,040
but I did not like any of them. I wanted 
something that was pretty and simple too.

1270
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:48,400
That evening, as I was getting ready for 
dinner, there was a knock at my bedroom door.  

1271
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:54,000
To my surprise, it was Mrs Danvers. She 
was holding a piece of paper in her hand.  

1272
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:58,000
It was a drawing of a costume which 
I had sketched and then thrown away.

1273
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:04,720
'I found this, Madam,' Mrs Danvers said. 'I 
thought you had thrown it away by mistake.'

1274
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,680
'No, Mrs Danvers, I don't want 
it, thank you,' I said quickly.

1275
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,840
I hoped she would go, but she stood at the door.

1276
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:19,760
'So you haven't decided what to wear, 
Madam,' Mrs Danvers said in a friendly voice.

1277
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,520
'No, I haven't decided yet,' I replied.

1278
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:28,960
'Perhaps you could copy one of the pictures 
in the gallery,' Mrs Danvers suggested.  

1279
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,000
'Many of them would make beautiful 
costumes. What does Mr de Winter think?'

1280
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:42,240
'I don't know,' I said. 'I wanted to surprise 
him. I was going to keep my costume a secret.'

1281
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,480
Mrs Danvers looked pleased at my words.

1282
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,440
'Then I suggest that you have your 
costume made in London, Madam.  

1283
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:55,120
There is a shop in Bond Street that would 
do it really well. I have always liked  

1284
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:59,520
the picture of the girl in white,' Mrs 
Danvers went on in the same friendly way.

1285
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:05,520
'The picture is about two hundred years 
old. The girl's wearing a very simple dress.  

1286
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,920
It would be easy to copy.'

1287
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:15,120
I did not know what to say. I knew the picture 
well. I wished I had thought of the idea myself.

1288
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:18,400
'Thank you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

1289
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,840
Mrs Danvers went out quietly. I 
wondered why she was so friendly.  

1290
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:27,200
Perhaps Maxim's anger had frightened her a little.

1291
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,840
As I went down to dinner, I stopped in 
front of the picture of the young girl.  

1292
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:39,440
Her name was Caroline de Winter and she had been 
famous for her beauty. The dress was very simple,  

1293
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:45,600
with short sleeves and a long, full skirt. Her 
hair was in curls. I would have to wear a wig  

1294
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:51,840
over my own straight hair. I felt very excited. 
I was glad that I had chosen my costume at last.  

1295
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:56,960
I said nothing to Maxim. The next 
day I made a sketch of the picture.  

1296
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,760
Then I sent the drawing to the shop in London with 
careful instructions about the dress and the wig.

1297
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,840
The preparations for the great day went 
on. No one expected me to do anything.  

1298
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,840
Slowly, the great house began to change. 
Furniture was moved as the great hall was  

1299
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:19,840
prepared for dancing. Coloured lights were hung in 
the trees outside. There were flowers everywhere.  

1300
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:24,960
Hundreds of them were brought in from the garden 
and Mrs Danvers knew exactly how to arrange them.  

1301
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:33,840
Manderley took on a new beauty. I had never 
seen the old house looking so lovely.
 
 

1302
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,200
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1303
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,280
Miss Caroline de Winter

1304
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,240
On the day of the Ball, Maxim 
and I had lunch with Frank.  

1305
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:53,760
My dress and the wig had arrived and they 
both looked perfect. Maxim and Frank asked  

1306
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,200
me about my costume but I told them nothing. 
The secret made me feel excited and important.

1307
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:04,720
'You won't know it's me,' I told them. 'You 
will both have the surprise of your lives.'

1308
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:10,720
Maxim and I went back to the house after lunch. 
The band had arrived and we welcomed the men.  

1309
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,200
The afternoon seemed very long. 
I thought about going for a walk.  

1310
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,240
Then suddenly, it was tea-time and Beatrice 
and her husband, Giles, had arrived.

1311
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:26,960
'This is like old times,' said Beatrice, looking 
around. 'Everything is as beautiful as ever.  

1312
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:31,920
What's everyone going to wear? I suppose 
you refuse to wear fancy dress, Maxim?'

1313
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:35,920
'Of course,' Maxim said. 'I 
prefer to be comfortable.'

1314
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,800
'I'm going to dress as an Arab,' said 
Giles. 'I got the idea from a friend.'

1315
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,960
'What about you, Mrs Lacy?' 
Frank said to Beatrice.

1316
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,680
'I'm in Eastern dress, too. I'm 
wearing a veil and lots of jewellery.  

1317
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:52,080
I'll be cool and comfortable. 
That's all that matters.'

1318
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,080
Beatrice turned to me.

1319
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:59,920
'And what is our hostess going to wear?' 
she asked. 'The Ball is for you, after all.  

1320
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,160
We all expect you to wear 
something really special.'

1321
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,840
'Don't ask her,' said Maxim. 'She won't tell 
anyone. She's had the dress made in London.'

1322
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,640
'It's quite simple really,' I said.

1323
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:15,200
'What fun it all is,' said Beatrice. 
'I'm getting excited already.'

1324
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,280
'You've got her to thank for 
it,' said Maxim, smiling at me.

1325
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:24,320
Everyone looked at me and 
smiled. I felt pleased and happy.  

1326
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,600
This Ball was for me because I was 
a bride, the new Mrs de Winter.  

1327
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,320
Manderley had been made into a place 
of light and beauty, just for me.

1328
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:40,240
'What's the time?' I said. 'I think 
we ought to be getting ready.'

1329
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:45,440
I found Clarice waiting for me in my bedroom, 
her face full of excitement. I locked the door  

1330
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:50,960
and took the dress from its box. It fitted 
perfectly. I looked at myself in the mirror.  

1331
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:58,160
I smiled. I felt different already. I was someone 
more exciting and interesting than my usual self.

1332
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:03,200
'Give me the wig, Clarice,' I said. 'Be 
careful, the curls mustn't be flat.'

1333
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:08,800
I brushed back my own straight hair. 
Carefully, I put the wig in place.  

1334
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:15,520
I looked in the mirror again. The wig and the 
tightly fitting dress made me almost beautiful.

1335
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,080
'Oh, Clarice,' I said. 'What 
will Mr de Winter say?'

1336
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,240
There was a knock on the door.

1337
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,440
'Who's there?' I called. 'You can't come in.'

1338
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,520
'It's me, my dear,' said Beatrice. 'Are 
you ready? I want to have a look at you.'

1339
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:36,720
'No, no,' I said, 'you can't come in. Tell Maxim  

1340
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:39,680
that he can't come in either. 
I'll come down when I'm ready.'

1341
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:45,120
I looked in the mirror 
again. My eyes looked larger  

1342
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:50,400
and the curls made a soft cloud round my head. 
I lifted the skirt of the dress in my hands.

1343
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,880
'Unlock the door,' I said to 
Clarice. 'I'm going down.'

1344
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,880
I stood in the gallery and 
looked down on the hall below.

1345
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:04,960
There was Giles in his white Arab costume. 
Beatrice was wearing a long green dress.  

1346
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:09,840
Frank was dressed as a sailor. Only 
Maxim was wearing evening clothes.

1347
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,440
'I don't know what she's 
doing,' I heard Maxim say.  

1348
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:18,160
'What's the time, Frank? She must be down soon.'

1349
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:23,280
I looked up at the picture of Caroline 
de Winter. Yes, her dress was exactly  

1350
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,640
like mine and she had the same curled hair. 
The band was playing softly in the gallery.

1351
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,920
'Beat the drum,' I said, 'and call 
out: Miss Caroline de Winter.'

1352
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,680
The drum sounded. Everyone looked up.

1353
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,040
'Miss Caroline de Winter,' the man shouted.

1354
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,840
I stood at the top of the stairs, smiling.  

1355
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,760
I expected everyone to laugh and 
clap as I walked down the stairs.

1356
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:58,640
Nobody laughed. Nobody clapped. They all 
stared at me without moving. I smiled at Maxim.

1357
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,760
'How do you do, Mr de Winter?' I said.

1358
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:06,640
Maxim stared up at me. His 
face was completely white.  

1359
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:14,240
Something was wrong. Why was Maxim looking 
like that? He moved towards the stairs.

1360
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,720
'What the hell do you think 
you're doing?' he said.

1361
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,200
His eyes were on fire with anger.

1362
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,800
'It's the picture,' I said. 
'The one in the gallery.'

1363
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:28,240
There was a long silence. Still nobody moved.

1364
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:30,800
'What is it?' I said. 'What have I done?'

1365
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:38,880
When Maxim answered, his voice was cold and 
hard. 'Go and take off that dress! It doesn't  

1366
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,640
matter what you wear. Any evening dress 
will do. Go quickly, before anyone comes.'  

1367
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:48,080
I could not speak. I stood staring at Maxim.  

1368
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,880
'What are you standing there for?' he 
asked me. 'Didn't you hear what I said?'

1369
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,960
I turned and ran up the stairs. 
My eyes were full of tears.  

1370
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:03,600
I did not know what I was doing. 
The door to the west wing was open.  

1371
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:10,320
Mrs Danvers was standing there. I shall 
never forget the terrible look on her face.  

1372
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:17,840
It was a look of joy - of joy and the most 
terrible hate. She stood there, smiling at me.

1373
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:23,840
Then I ran from her, back to my room, tripping 
and nearly falling over my long skirt.

1374
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,800
Clarice was waiting for me in my 
bedroom. She had heard what had happened.  

1375
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,920
When she saw my face, Clarice started to cry.

1376
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:38,160
'It doesn't matter, Clarice,' I said. 
'Help me take off this dress. Quickly.'

1377
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:44,480
'What will you wear, Madam?' Clarice asked 
me. 'I don't know,' I said. 'Leave me alone  

1378
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:51,840
now. I'll be all right. Go down and enjoy the 
party. Don't tell anyone what has happened.'

1379
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:58,080
After Clarice had gone, someone knocked at 
the door. It opened and Beatrice came in.

1380
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:04,560
'My dear,' she said, 'are you all right?' I 
put a hand up to my head and took off the wig.  

1381
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:10,320
'Of course I knew at once that it was a mistake,' 
Beatrice said. 'You could not have known.'

1382
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,080
'Known what?' I said, turning to look at her.

1383
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:20,640
'Why, about your costume. It was exactly what 
Rebecca wore at the last Fancy Dress Ball here.  

1384
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:24,560
As you stood on the stairs, I 
thought for one terrible moment...'

1385
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,080
'I ought to have known,' I said.

1386
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:35,440
I was thinking of Mrs Danvers. She had 
planned this. She had known what would happen.

1387
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,760
'How could you know?' said Beatrice. 
'But it was a terrible shock to Maxim.  

1388
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:48,160
He thinks that you did it as a joke. He thinks 
that is why you kept your dress a secret. But he  

1389
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:53,040
will understand when you speak to him. I'm going 
to tell everyone that your dress didn't fit.'

1390
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,360
I did not say anything.

1391
01:58:56,320 --> 01:59:02,240
'Now, what can you wear?' Beatrice said. 'Here, 
this blue dress is very pretty. Put this on.'

1392
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,760
'No,' I said. 'I'm not going down.'

1393
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,800
Beatrice stared at me before she spoke.

1394
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:13,280
'But, my dear, you must. It will look so strange.'

1395
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,840
I felt very tired.

1396
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,640
'What does it matter?' I said.

1397
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,600
Beatrice looked shocked at my words.

1398
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:26,320
'Think of Maxim. You must 
come down for him,' she said.

1399
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,480
'I can't, I can't,' I answered.

1400
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,800
Beatrice stared at me.

1401
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,160
'I must go down now,' she said at last. 
'They will be waiting for me at dinner.  

1402
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,200
I'll tell Maxim you'll be 
down in a minute, shall I?'

1403
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,320
I did not answer and Beatrice walked 
slowly to the door and went out.

1404
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,960
After a long time I got up from 
the bed where I was sitting.  

1405
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:56,000
I walked across to the window. I could 
see the coloured lights in the trees.  

1406
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:01,280
I walked back to the dressing-table and looked 
at my white face and red eyes in the mirror.  

1407
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:08,400
Then slowly I washed my face and combed my hair. I 
put the white dress and the wig back into the box.  

1408
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:14,000
I never wanted to see them again. I 
picked up the blue dress and put it on.

1409
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,480
When I was ready, I opened the 
door and walked along the corridor.  

1410
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:23,840
Everything was still and quiet. 
Then I heard the sound of voices.  

1411
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:28,800
The door of the dining-room was open. The guests 
were coming out of dinner. Someone laughed.

1412
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I walked slowly down the stairs to meet them.

1413
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,640
I remember very little of the first party 
at Manderley. It was the first and the last  

1414
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:43,520
we ever held there. I remember that Frank 
tried to make me drink a little champagne.  

1415
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:48,400
I remember Beatrice smiling at 
me. I remember dancing with Giles.

1416
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:54,320
The band played and people danced. 
I stood there smiling at everyone.  

1417
02:00:54,320 --> 02:01:01,040
Maxim stood beside me. His eyes were cold and 
hard, not the eyes of the man I knew and loved.  

1418
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,800
All through that long night, 
Maxim never looked at me.

1419
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,480
Once, Beatrice came up to me and said, 'Why 
don't you sit down? You look like death.'

1420
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:16,720
What was the time? I did not know. 
The night passed, hour after hour.  

1421
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:22,080
Then at last Giles came up to me and said, 
'Come and look at the fireworks on the terrace.'

1422
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:28,720
I remember standing on the terrace and staring 
up at the sky. The fireworks rose into the sky  

1423
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:34,560
and turned into stars and flowers. The sky 
was red and gold. Every window of the house  

1424
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,520
was coloured by the falling lights. The grey 
walls of Manderley looked heavy and dark.

1425
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:46,640
Then suddenly, the sky was dark too. The 
fireworks were over. I heard the sound of cars  

1426
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:51,920
starting in the drive. 'They're beginning to go,' 
I thought. 'Thank God, they're beginning to go.'

1427
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,040
People came up to me to say goodbye.

1428
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:59,040
'Such a wonderful party,' they said. 'Thank you so  

1429
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,880
much for a wonderful evening. The best 
party I've been to for a long time.'

1430
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:06,080
I shook hands with them all. I smiled.

1431
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:12,320
'I'm so glad, so glad,' I said. 
I could think of no other words.

1432
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:17,840
Maxim had gone with Frank to stand 
in the drive. Beatrice Came up to me.

1433
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:24,320
'Well done, my dear,' she said. 'The Ball was 
a great success. No one had any idea about...  

1434
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:30,320
you know. You must go to bed now. You look 
very tired. Have your breakfast in bed.'

1435
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,640
'Yes. Yes, perhaps I shall,' I said.

1436
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,520
'I'll tell Maxim you've gone up to bed, shall I?'

1437
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:39,440
'Yes, please, Beatrice.'

1438
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,240
'All right, my dear. Sleep well.'

1439
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:48,960
I walked slowly into the house. The lights 
had been turned off. The rooms were empty.  

1440
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:55,280
I went up the stairs and along the corridor 
to my room. It was almost light now and a bird  

1441
02:02:55,280 --> 02:03:02,080
had started to sing. I undressed slowly and 
got into bed. I lay back and closed my eyes.

1442
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,920
My body was tired, but my mind would not rest.  

1443
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:11,920
I wondered how long Maxim would be. The little 
clock by my bed ticked away the minutes.  

1444
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:27,840
I lay on my side, watching it. An hour 
went by. But Maxim did not come.
 
 

1445
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,440
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1446
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,280
'Why Don't You Jump?'

1447
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,640
I fell asleep at about seven o'clock. 
When I woke up again, it was after eleven.  

1448
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,280
Clarice had brought me some tea. 
It was cold now, but I drank it.  

1449
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:51,200
Maxim's bed was empty. He had not come to bed at 
all. I sat up, looking straight in front of me.

1450
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:59,520
My marriage was a failure. It had failed after 
only three months. I was too young for Maxim,  

1451
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:04,720
I knew too little about the world. The fact 
that I loved him made no difference. It was  

1452
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:09,840
not the sort of love he needed. Maxim was 
not in love with me. He had never loved me.  

1453
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:15,680
He did not belong to me, he belonged to 
Rebecca. Rebecca was the real Mrs de Winter.

1454
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:22,240
I could never be the mistress of Manderley. 
Wherever I walked, wherever I sat,  

1455
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:30,240
I saw Rebecca. I knew her well. I knew her tall, 
slim figure, her small face and clear white skin.  

1456
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,280
If I ever heard her voice, I would know it.  

1457
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:41,440
Rebecca - always Rebecca. I would never escape 
from Rebecca. She was too strong for me.

1458
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:47,600
I got out of bed and opened the 
curtains. Sunlight filled the room.  

1459
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:53,680
I could not hide in my bedroom any longer. 
I had a bath, dressed and went downstairs.  

1460
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,680
The servants had been very busy. The rooms 
were clean and tidy. The flowers had gone.  

1461
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:03,360
Soon there would be nothing to 
remind us of the Fancy Dress Ball.

1462
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,080
I met Robert in the dining-room.

1463
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:11,760
'Good morning, Robert,' I said. 'Have 
you seen Mr de Winter anywhere?'

1464
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,640
'He went out soon after breakfast, 
Madam. He has not been in since.'

1465
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:21,440
I went into the small room behind the 
library and picked up the telephone.  

1466
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:28,480
Perhaps Maxim was with Frank. I had to talk 
to Maxim. I had to explain about last night.

1467
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:33,840
'Frank, it's me,' I said when 
he answered. 'Where's Maxim?'

1468
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:41,760
'I don't know. I haven't seen him,' Frank said. 
'How did he sleep? How was he at breakfast?'

1469
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:47,840
'Frank,' I said slowly, 'Maxim 
did not come to bed last night.'

1470
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,200
There was silence.

1471
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,240
'I was afraid something like that 
would happen,' Frank said at last.

1472
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:59,440
'Where do you think he's gone?' 
I asked. 'I must see him.  

1473
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:04,160
I've got to explain about last night. 
Maxim thinks I did it as a joke.'

1474
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:09,440
I could not stop my tears now. They 
poured down my face as I spoke.

1475
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:14,960
'You mustn't talk like that,' Frank 
said. 'Let me come up and see you.'

1476
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:20,080
'No,' I said. 'It has happened. 
Nothing can be changed now.  

1477
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:24,880
Perhaps that's a good thing. I 
understand things more clearly now.'

1478
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:27,920
'What do you mean?' said Frank, quickly.

1479
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,160
'Maxim doesn't love me, he loves Rebecca,' I said.  

1480
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:39,280
'He's never forgotten her. He's never loved me, 
Frank. It's always Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca.'

1481
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,000
I heard Frank cry out.

1482
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,720
'I've got to come and see you,' he said.

1483
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:51,200
I put down the telephone stood up. I did 
not want to see Frank. He could not help me.  

1484
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,440
No one could help me, but myself.

1485
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:59,920
Perhaps I would never see Maxim again. Perhaps 
Maxim had left me and would never come back.  

1486
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,960
I could not get these thoughts out of my mind.

1487
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:08,160
I went to the window and looked 
out. A fog had come up from the sea.  

1488
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:13,600
I could not see the woods. It was very hot, 
but the sun was hidden behind the wall of fog.  

1489
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,960
I could hear the sea and I 
could smell it in the fog.  

1490
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:24,240
I walked out of the house and on to the lawn. I 
looked back at the house. One of the shutters in  

1491
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:30,240
the west wing had been pulled back. Someone was 
standing there, looking down at me. For a moment,  

1492
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:36,000
I thought that it was Maxim. Then the figure 
moved and I saw that it was Mrs Danvers.

1493
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,600
I felt that she knew about my tears. 
She had planned all this to happen.  

1494
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,600
This was her triumph - hers and Rebecca's.

1495
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:52,320
I remembered Mrs Danvers smiling at me, like a 
devil. But she was a living woman like myself.  

1496
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:59,200
She was not dead, like Rebecca. I could not speak 
to Rebecca, but I could speak to Mrs Danvers.

1497
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:05,120
I walked back across the lawn. I went through 
the house, along the dark silent corridor of  

1498
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:09,440
the west wing to Rebecca's room. I turned 
the handle of the door and went inside.

1499
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:16,720
Mrs Danvers was still standing by the window. 
The shutter was folded back. She turned to me  

1500
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:21,840
and I saw that her eyes were red with crying. 
There were dark shadows on her white face.

1501
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:25,920
'You've done what you 
wanted, Mrs Danvers,' I said.  

1502
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:31,200
'You wanted this to happen, didn't you? 
Are you pleased now? Are you happy?'

1503
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,760
She turned her head away from me.

1504
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:38,000
'Why did you ever come to Manderley?' she said.  

1505
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,760
'Nobody wanted you. We were 
all right until you came.'

1506
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,920
'You seem to forget that I 
love Mr de Winter,' I said.

1507
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,320
'If you loved him, you would never 
have married him,' Mrs Danvers said.

1508
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:55,200
'Why do you hate me?' I asked. 
'What have I done to you?'

1509
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,680
'You tried to take Mrs de 
Winter's place,' she said.

1510
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:06,480
'But I changed nothing here. I left everything 
to you. I wanted to be friends with you,' I said.

1511
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,400
She did not answer.

1512
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:14,560
'Many people marry twice,' I said. 'My 
marriage to Mr de Winter isn't a crime.  

1513
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:18,240
Haven't we a right to be happy?'

1514
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:22,880
'Mr de Winter is not happy,' Mrs 
Danvers said, looking at me at last.  

1515
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:29,360
'Look into his eyes. He's in hell. He has 
looked like that ever since she died.'

1516
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:35,440
'It's not true,' I said. 'It's not true. He 
was happy when we were in Italy together.'

1517
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:42,400
'Well, he's a man, isn't he?' she said with a hard 
laugh. 'Every man likes to enjoy his honeymoon.'

1518
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:47,600
I was suddenly very angry and not 
afraid of Mrs Danvers any more.  

1519
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:50,160
I went up to her and shook her by the arm.

1520
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:56,720
'How dare you speak to me like that? How dare 
you? You made me wear that dress last night. You  

1521
02:09:56,720 --> 02:10:01,520
wanted to hurt Mr de Winter. Do you think his pain 
and unhappiness will bring Mrs de Winter back?'

1522
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,240
Mrs Danvers moved away from me.

1523
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:10,880
'What do I care for his pain?' she said. 
'He's never cared about mine. How do you  

1524
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:15,280
think I've felt, watching you sit in 
her place, using the things she used?  

1525
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:21,360
I hear the servants calling you Mrs de Winter. 
And all the time, the real Mrs de Winter,  

1526
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:25,360
with her smile and her lovely face is 
lying cold and dead in the church.'

1527
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:30,240
Mrs Danvers' face was twisted with 
pain. Her voice was loud and hard.

1528
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:34,320
'Mr de Winter deserves his pain, marrying a  

1529
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:39,200
young girl like you - and only ten months 
afterwards. Well, he's paying for it now.  

1530
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:44,640
He knows she is watching him. My 
lady comes at night and watches him.

1531
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,320
'I looked after her when she 
was a child. Did you know that?'

1532
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:54,480
'No,' I said, 'no. What's the use of this, 
Mrs Danvers? I don't want to hear any more.'

1533
02:10:55,680 --> 02:11:00,400
Mrs Danvers did not seem to hear me. She 
went on speaking in a high, harsh voice.

1534
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:06,800
'Mrs de Winter was a lovely child,' she 
said. 'When she was only twelve years old,  

1535
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:11,760
the men could not stop looking at her. But 
even then, she cared for nothing and nobody.  

1536
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:17,440
And that's how she was when she grew up. She 
was beaten in the end. But it wasn't a man.  

1537
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:23,840
It wasn't a woman. The sea got her. The 
sea was too strong for her in the end.'

1538
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,960
Mrs Danvers began to cry noisily, 
with her mouth open and her eyes dry.

1539
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:33,680
'Mrs Danvers, you're not well. 
You ought to be in bed,' I said.

1540
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,520
She looked at me angrily.

1541
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:40,560
'Leave me alone. Why shouldn't 
I cry? What's it to do with you?  

1542
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:44,320
You came here and thought you 
could take Mrs de Winter's place.  

1543
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:49,120
You! Why, even the servants laughed 
at you when you came to Manderley.'

1544
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:53,520
'You'd better stop this, Mrs Danvers,' 
I said. 'You'd better go to your room.'

1545
02:11:54,640 --> 02:12:00,080
'Yes. And then what will you do? You'll 
go to Mr de Winter and tell him that Mrs  

1546
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:05,840
Danvers has been unkind to you. You'll go to 
him like you did when Mr Favell came here.

1547
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:09,760
'Mr de Winter was jealous of 
Mr Favell when she was alive.  

1548
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,920
He's jealous now. That shows you 
he's not forgotten her, doesn't it?  

1549
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:20,400
Of course Mr de Winter was jealous. She didn't 
care. She only laughed. All the men fell in  

1550
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:25,920
love with her, Mr de Winter, Mr Favell, 
Mr Crawley. It was like a game to her.'

1551
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,360
'I don't want to know,' I 
said. 'I don't want to know.'

1552
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:33,840
Mrs Danvers came close to me 
and put her face near to mine.

1553
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:40,640
'It's no use, is it?' she said. 'She's 
the real Mrs de Winter, not you.'

1554
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:48,000
I backed away from her, towards the 
window. She took my hand and held it.

1555
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,600
'Why don't you go?' she said again. 
'He doesn't want you, he never did.  

1556
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:59,120
He can't forget her. He wants to be 
alone in the house again, with her.'

1557
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:04,320
She pushed me towards the open window. I 
could see the stones of the terrace below.  

1558
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,040
Beyond the terrace was a white wall of fog.

1559
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:15,280
'Look down there,' Mrs Danvers said. 
'It's easy, isn't it? Why don't you  

1560
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:24,240
jump? It wouldn't hurt. It's not like drowning. 
Why don't you try it? Why don't you go?'

1561
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:28,880
The fog came in through the 
open window, damp and thick.  

1562
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,760
I held on to the window ledge with both hands.

1563
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:36,640
'Don't be afraid,' said Mrs 
Danvers. 'I won't push you.  

1564
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:46,240
You can jump. You're not happy. Mr de Winter 
doesn't love you. Why don't you jump now?'

1565
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:52,160
The fog was thicker than before. 
There was fog below and all around me.  

1566
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:59,840
If I jumped now, I would not see the stones. 
The fall would kill me. Maxim did not love me.

1567
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:07,760
'Go on,' whispered Mrs Danvers. 
'Go on, don't be afraid.'

1568
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,960
I shut my eyes. My fingers 
ached from holding the ledge.  

1569
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:19,920
The thick fog made me forget my unhappiness. 
I could forget about loving Maxim. I could  

1570
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:25,920
forget about Rebecca. I would not have 
to think about Rebecca any more...

1571
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:31,680
A loud explosion shook the window where we 
stood. The glass cracked. I opened my eyes  

1572
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:37,360
and stared at Mrs Danvers. The first explosion was 
followed by another, then a third and a fourth.

1573
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,120
'What is it?' I said. 'What has happened?'

1574
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:46,560
Mrs Danvers let go my arm. She stared 
out of the window into the fog.

1575
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:52,080
'It's the rockets,' she said. 'There 
must be a ship in trouble in the bay.'

1576
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,720
We listened, staring into the white fog together.  

1577
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:07,840
And then we heard the sound of 
footsteps on the terrace below us.
 
 

1578
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:17,920
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

1579
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:22,320
Rebecca Has Won

1580
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:26,800
It was Maxim down on the terrace. I could 
not see him, but I could hear his voice.  

1581
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,280
I heard Frith answer from the hall.

1582
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:36,080
'A ship's hit the rocks in the bay,' Maxim 
called out. 'The fog is terrible out there.  

1583
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:38,720
Tell Mrs Danvers to have food 
and drink ready for the men.  

1584
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,440
I'm going back to the bay to 
see if I can do anything.'

1585
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:44,640
Mrs Danvers moved back from the window.

1586
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:50,000
'We had better go down,' 
she said in her usual voice.  

1587
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:55,120
'Frith will be looking for me. Be careful of 
your hands. I am going to close the window.'

1588
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,800
Then she went to the door and held it open for me.

1589
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,080
'When you see Mr de Winter, Madam,  

1590
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:05,280
please tell him there will be a hot 
meal ready for the men at any time.'

1591
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,600
I stared at her.

1592
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:12,240
'Yes,' I said. 'Yes, Mrs Danvers.'

1593
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:20,160
She turned her back on me and went along the 
corridor. I walked slowly out of the room. I  

1594
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:25,760
felt as though I had just woken up from a long 
sleep. When I reached the hall, I saw Frith.

1595
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:32,080
'Did you hear the rockets, Madam?' he 
said. 'Mr de Winter's gone down to the bay.  

1596
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:35,120
He went across the lawn only a few minutes ago.'

1597
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:40,240
I went out on to the terrace. The 
fog was beginning to clear and I  

1598
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:44,479
could see the woods again. I looked up 
at the window above my head. It looked  

1599
02:16:44,479 --> 02:16:50,319
very high. I suddenly felt very hot. 
My head ached and my hands were wet.  

1600
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:58,639
I stood very still. Then for the first time I 
realized that Maxim had not gone away. I had heard  

1601
02:16:58,640 --> 02:17:06,080
his voice and he was down there in the bay. Maxim 
was safe. Nothing else mattered if Maxim was safe.

1602
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:11,519
I began to walk along the path through 
the woods. The fog had almost gone now.  

1603
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:16,559
When I came to the bay, I could see the 
ship at once. She was on the rocks about  

1604
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:20,000
two miles from the shore. There 
were some small boats near her.

1605
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,359
I climbed up the path to the cliffs above the bay.  

1606
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:27,840
Frank was there talking to a 
coast-guard, but I could not see Maxim.

1607
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:32,719
'They're going to send a diver down soon, 
Mrs de Winter,' said the coastguard.  

1608
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:35,040
'They want to see if they can 
get the ship off the rocks.'

1609
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,240
'Have you seen Maxim?' I asked Frank.

1610
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:45,519
'He's taken one of the sailors to hospital,' Frank 
told me. 'The man was hurt. Maxim is always a  

1611
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:50,880
great help at times like this. What are you going 
to do? Can I walk back with you to the house?'

1612
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:55,840
'I think I'll stay here. I want 
to see the diver go down,' I said.

1613
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:00,320
'Very well,' Frank said. 'I shall 
be at the office if you want me.'

1614
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:03,041
The coastguard looked at his watch.

1615
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,359
'Well, I must be getting along 
too,' he said. 'Good afternoon.'

1616
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:15,599
The sea was calm now. The diver went down and came 
up again. Nothing else happened. It was very hot.  

1617
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,840
I sat on the cliffs for a long time 
doing nothing, thinking of nothing.

1618
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:25,680
When I looked at my watch again, it was three 
o'clock. I got up and walked down the hill to  

1619
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:31,120
the bay. When I came to the other side, 
I saw Ben. He stood there, smiling at me.

1620
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:34,720
'Seen the big ship?' he said.

1621
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:38,640
'Yes,' I said. 'She's on the rocks, isn't she?'

1622
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:45,280
'She'll break up,' he said. 'The big 
ship won't go down like the little one.  

1623
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,840
She won't come back, will she?'

1624
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,160
'Who?' I asked him.

1625
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:53,840
'Her,' he said. 'The other one.'

1626
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:59,840
I did not know what Ben meant. I left him and 
walked towards the path through the woods.  

1627
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:05,840
I did not look at the cottage. As I went up the 
path, a strange fear began to fill my heart.

1628
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:10,560
The house looked very peaceful. 
Manderley was a place of safety  

1629
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:16,720
and looked more beautiful than I had ever seen it. 
I felt, for the first time, that it was my home.  

1630
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,880
I belonged to Manderley and 
Manderley belonged to me.

1631
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:27,359
I went through the house and into the library. 
Jasper was not there. He must have gone out with  

1632
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:33,839
Maxim. I suddenly felt very hungry, and so I 
asked Robert to bring in the tea. I still had  

1633
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:40,240
a strange feeling of fear in my heart. I felt that 
I was waiting for something - something terrible.

1634
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:44,560
As I sat drinking my tea, 
Robert came back into the room.

1635
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,840
'Captain Searle, the harbour-master, 
is on the phone, Madam,' he told me.  

1636
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:54,160
'He wants to come here and speak to Mr de 
Winter at once. He says it's very important.'

1637
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:01,920
'Mr de Winter is not back yet, Robert,' I told 
him. 'Ask Captain Searle to come up and wait.'

1638
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:06,319
Robert went out of the room with the message. 
I wondered what Captain Searle wanted to say.  

1639
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:11,359
It must be something to do with the ship out 
in the bay. But why did he want to see Maxim?

1640
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,160
Captain Searle came into the 
library about fifteen minutes later.  

1641
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,560
He looked at me with his bright blue eyes.

1642
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,560
'I'm afraid I've got some bad news for Mr 
de Winter. I don't know how to tell him.'

1643
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:28,000
'What sort of news, Captain Searle?' I asked him.

1644
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:34,720
'Well, Mrs de Winter, it's not very pleasant. 
When we sent the diver down to look at the ship,  

1645
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:38,960
he found something else. It 
was a little sailing boat.  

1646
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,840
It's the boat that belonged 
to the late Mrs de Winter.'

1647
02:20:44,479 --> 02:20:50,000
'I'm sorry,' I said. 'Must you tell Mr 
de Winter? Can't the boat be left there?'

1648
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:57,439
'The man found something else,' Captain Searle 
answered slowly. 'The cabin door was closed,  

1649
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:04,160
so he broke a window and looked in. Then he got 
a terrible fright. There was a body in there  

1650
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:11,840
on the cabin floor. I must tell your husband, 
Mrs de Winter. The police will have to know too.'

1651
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:15,040
This was the reason for the 
strange fear in my heart.  

1652
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,319
Someone had been in the boat 
with Rebecca that night.

1653
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,360
'Do we have to tell him?' I asked.

1654
02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:29,599
'I've got to do my duty,' Captain Searle said. 
He stopped. The door had opened. It was Maxim.

1655
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:34,000
'Hello,' he said. 'Is something 
the matter, Captain Searle?'

1656
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:41,040
I felt very afraid. I went out of the room 
quickly and shut the door behind me. Jasper was  

1657
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:47,120
in the hall and he walked out on to the terrace 
with me. I sat down. I must not fail Maxim now.

1658
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:51,599
I sat on the terrace until I heard 
Captain Searle's car drive away.  

1659
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,559
Then I stood up and walked 
slowly back to the library.

1660
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:59,440
Maxim was standing by the window. 
I went and stood beside him.  

1661
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,559
I took his hand and held it against my face.

1662
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:10,799
'I want to help you, Maxim,' I said. 'I've 
grown up, you know. I'm not a child any more.'

1663
02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:14,799
Maxim put his arm round me and held me closely.

1664
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:19,120
'I was angry with you last 
night, wasn't I?' he said.

1665
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:24,080
'Maxim,' I asked him, 'can't we start again?'

1666
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:32,720
'It's too late, my darling, too late,' he said. 
'We've lost our chance of happiness. Something  

1667
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:38,720
has happened. Something I've dreamt about, night 
after night. I knew we could never be happy.'

1668
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:42,880
Maxim held both my hands and looked into my face.

1669
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:46,080
'Rebecca has won,' he said.

1670
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:52,559
I stared at him. My heart began to beat 
fast. What was Maxim trying to tell me?

1671
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:56,160
'I always knew this would happen,' Maxim said.  

1672
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:02,080
'Rebecca has kept us apart all this time. I 
remember how she looked at me before she died.  

1673
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:08,160
I remember her smile. She knew this would 
happen. She knew she would win in the end.'

1674
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:16,000
'Maxim,' I whispered. 'What are you trying to tell 
me? Captain Searle told me about the boat. There  

1675
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:21,840
was someone sailing with Rebecca. You have to 
find out who it was. That's it, isn't it, Maxim?'

1676
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:32,000
'No,' he said, 'you don't understand. There 
was no one with Rebecca. She was alone.'

1677
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,960
I stood there watching his 
face, watching his eyes.

1678
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:38,960
'It's Rebecca's body lying 
there on the cabin floor.'

1679
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:41,840
'No,' I said. 'No!'

1680
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:50,160
'The woman buried in the church is not Rebecca. 
I always knew that,' Maxim said. 'Rebecca was  

1681
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:57,760
not drowned. I killed her. I shot Rebecca in 
the cottage. I carried her body to the cabin,  

1682
02:23:58,399 --> 02:24:03,679
took the boat out that night and sank it. It's 
Rebecca who's lying there on the cabin floor.  

1683
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:13,840
Will you look into my eyes and 
tell me that you love me now?'
 
 

1684
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:24,880
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

1685
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,840
The Truth About Rebecca

1686
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:35,280
It was very quiet in the library. When people have 
a great shock, they feel nothing at first. I stood  

1687
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:41,840
beside Maxim and I had no feelings at all. Then 
Maxim took me in his arms and began to kiss me.  

1688
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:46,480
I shut my eyes. He had never 
kissed me like this before.

1689
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,000
'I love you so much,' he whispered.

1690
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:56,160
This is what I had wanted him to say, every day 
and every night. But I could feel nothing now.

1691
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,920
Maxim stopped suddenly and 
pushed me away from him.

1692
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:05,600
'You see, I was right,' he said. 'It's 
too late. You don't love me now.'

1693
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:12,319
'It's not too late,' I said, putting my arms round 
him. 'I love you more than anything in the world.'

1694
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:20,640
'It's no use now,' said Maxim. 'We have no time. 
They've found the boat. They've found Rebecca.'

1695
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,880
I stared at him, not understanding.

1696
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:27,760
'What will they do?' I said.

1697
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:32,960
'They will make sure that the body in 
the cabin is Rebecca. Then they will  

1698
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:38,640
remember that other body in the church. The 
other woman - the one I said was Rebecca.'

1699
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:42,080
'What are we going to do?' I said.

1700
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:44,240
Maxim did not answer.

1701
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:48,800
'Does anyone know? Anyone at all?' I said.

1702
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,920
Maxim shook his head.

1703
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:54,640
'Are you sure Frank doesn't 
know?' I asked quickly.

1704
02:25:55,600 --> 02:26:01,360
'How could he?' said Maxim. 'There was 
nobody there but me. It was dark...'  

1705
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,480
He stopped. He sat down on a chair 
and I went and knelt beside him.

1706
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:10,400
'Why didn't you tell me?' I whispered.

1707
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:17,359
'I nearly did, once,' Maxim said. 'But 
you always seemed so unhappy and so shy.'

1708
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:20,399
I answered very quietly.

1709
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:24,000
'I knew you were thinking 
about Rebecca all the time.  

1710
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,080
How could I ask you to love me 
when I knew you loved Rebecca?'

1711
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,240
'You thought I loved Rebecca?' he said.  

1712
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:39,040
'I hated her. We never loved each other. 
Rebecca never loved anyone except herself.'

1713
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,640
I sat on the floor, staring at him.

1714
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:47,920
'She was clever of course,' Maxim went on. 
'Everyone thought she was the kindest, the  

1715
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:52,880
most charming person. When I married her, people 
told me I was the luckiest man in the world.'

1716
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:57,920
'I found out the truth five days after 
we were married. We were in the hills  

1717
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:03,600
near Monte Carlo. It was the same place I went 
to with you. Do you remember? She sat there in  

1718
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:08,880
the car and told me terrible, evil things about 
herself. Things that I could not tell anyone.'

1719
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,520
Maxim stared out of the window.

1720
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:16,241
'I did not kill her then,' 
he said. 'I let her laugh.  

1721
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:21,200
She knew that I would take her to Manderley. 
She knew I would never divorce her.  

1722
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:24,640
I would never tell people all the 
terrible things she had told me.'

1723
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,399
Maxim came up to me and held out his hands.

1724
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:34,240
'You hate me, don't you?' he said. 
'You can't understand me, can you?'

1725
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:39,680
I did not say anything. I held 
his hands against my heart.  

1726
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:48,400
Only one thing mattered. Maxim did not love 
Rebecca. He had never loved her, never, never.

1727
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:51,040
Maxim was talking again.

1728
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:57,840
'I thought about Manderley too much,' he said. 
'I put Manderley first, before anything else.  

1729
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:02,720
I can't tell you about those terrible 
years with Rebecca. But she made  

1730
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:07,680
Manderley the place of beauty it is today. And 
I accepted everything, because of Manderley.

1731
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:14,319
'Rebecca was careful at first,' Maxim went 
on. 'She had a flat in London. She met her  

1732
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:20,319
friends there. Then she began to grow careless. 
She invited friends down here, to Manderley.  

1733
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:27,519
I warned her. I told her that Manderley was mine. 
Rebecca did not say anything. She only smiled.

1734
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:31,201
'Then Frank came to me and 
told me he wanted to leave.  

1735
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,840
He wouldn't say why at first. But I 
got the truth from him in the end.  

1736
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:42,319
Rebecca never left him alone. She was always 
going to his house and asking him to her cottage.

1737
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:48,479
'Rebecca went up to London for a time. When 
she came back, she took Giles out sailing  

1738
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:54,080
with her. I knew what had happened as soon as 
they came back. Beatrice and Giles never stayed  

1739
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:59,600
at Manderley again. After that, I knew 
I could never trust Rebecca with anyone.

1740
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:06,080
'She had a cousin, an awful man, called Jack 
Favell. He started to come here when I was away.'

1741
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:12,399
'I've met him,' I said. 'He came here the 
day you went to London. I didn't tell you.  

1742
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:14,000
I didn't want to remind you of Rebecca.'

1743
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:19,280
'Remind me?' said Maxim. 'Oh God, 
I never needed to be reminded.

1744
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:26,479
'Favell often stayed with Rebecca down at the 
cottage. He is a bad man. He's been in trouble  

1745
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:31,679
with the police many times. I told Rebecca that I 
would shoot Favell if he came to Manderley again.

1746
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,840
'Then, one night, I could 
stand our life here no longer.  

1747
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:40,241
Rebecca came back from London very 
late. She went to the cottage.  

1748
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:46,000
I thought Favell was with her. I went 
after them. I took a gun to frighten him.'

1749
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:51,359
Maxim was talking in quick, short 
sentences. I held his hand tightly.

1750
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,320
'I saw a light in the cottage and went in.  

1751
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:58,479
To my surprise, Rebecca was 
alone. She looked ill and strange.

1752
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:05,121
"This is the end," I told her. "I can't stand 
any more." Rebecca looked at me and smiled.

1753
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:10,640
"It won't be easy to divorce me," she said. 
"Everyone believes our marriage is perfect."

1754
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:12,480
'Then she stood up and walked towards me.

1755
02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:18,719
"If I had a child, Max," she said, "Everyone 
would think it was yours. You would like a son,  

1756
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:24,000
wouldn't you? A boy to grow up at Manderley. 
And you would never know who his father was."

1757
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:32,160
'And she smiled at me again. She was smiling when 
I killed her. The bullet went through her heart.'

1758
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:35,200
Maxim's voice was very low. He spoke slowly.

1759
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:41,280
'There was blood all over the floor. I had 
to get water from the sea to clean the place.

1760
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:47,280
'There was no moon and it was very dark,' 
Maxim went on. 'I carried Rebecca's body  

1761
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:53,120
to the boat. I laid the body on the floor of 
the cabin. Then I took the boat out into the  

1762
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:58,000
bay. I wanted to take the boat a good way 
out, but the wind was too strong for me.

1763
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:04,479
'I made some holes in the wooden planks with a 
metal spike. I opened the sea cocks and the sea  

1764
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:11,359
water flowed in. In a few minutes it had covered 
my feet. I shut the cabin door behind me, climbed  

1765
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:17,920
into the dinghy and rowed back. Rebecca's boat was 
already sinking. I sat and watched it go down.'

1766
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:20,399
Maxim looked at me.

1767
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:25,201
'That's all,' he said. 'There's no more to tell.'

1768
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:32,560
The library was very quiet. We sat there together 
for some minutes without saying anything.  

1769
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:35,120
Then Maxim began to speak again.

1770
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:39,360
'I knew the boat would be found one day,' he said.  

1771
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:44,399
'Rebecca knew she would win in the 
end. I saw her smile when she died.'

1772
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:49,840
'But Rebecca is dead,' I told him. 
'That's what we must remember.'

1773
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:55,840
'The diver has seen the body. They're 
going to get the boat up tomorrow morning.  

1774
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:59,440
They'll find out that it's 
Rebecca's body in the cabin.'

1775
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:04,480
'Then you must say you made a mistake about 
the other body. Nobody saw you that night.  

1776
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,920
We are the only two people who know 
what happened that night, Maxim.'

1777
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:12,080
'Yes,' he said. 'Yes, I suppose so.'

1778
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:15,840
'They will think the boat sank when 
Rebecca went down into the cabin.  

1779
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:21,040
They'll think she was trapped there. They'll 
think that, won't they, Maxim?' I said.

1780
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:27,281
'I don't know,' Maxim replied 
slowly. 'I don't know.'

1781
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:37,840
At that moment, the telephone in 
the next room began to ring.
 
 

1782
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:43,040
CHAPTER NINETEEN

1783
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:44,640
Colonel Julyan

1784
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:52,080
Maxim went into the little room and closed 
the door. I sat there, listening to the sound  

1785
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:58,000
of Maxim's voice. I was no longer afraid 
of Rebecca; I did not hate her any more.  

1786
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:06,000
Maxim and I were going to fight this 
together. Rebecca had not won, she had lost.

1787
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,520
'That was Colonel Julyan,' said Maxim, as he came 
back into the room. He is the local magistrate.  

1788
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,840
He has to be there when they get 
the boat up tomorrow. He asked  

1789
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,840
me if I had made a mistake about the other body.'

1790
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:24,000
The telephone began to ring again. Maxim answered 
it quickly and came back into the library.

1791
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,720
'It's begun,' he said.

1792
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:29,040
'What do you mean?' asked.

1793
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:34,800
'That was a reporter. The whole thing will be in 
the papers tomorrow. There's nothing we can do.'

1794
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:39,200
After dinner, we went back 
into the library as usual.  

1795
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:47,840
I sat at Maxim's feet, my head against his knees. 
In a strange way, we were completely happy.

1796
02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:52,799
Rain fell in the night. When I woke up in 
the morning, Maxim had already gone out.  

1797
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:59,280
I went down to breakfast as usual. There were 
a lot of letters thanking us for the Ball. How  

1798
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:06,559
far away that seemed! I felt calmer, much older 
now. I took the letters into the morning-room.  

1799
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:12,800
To my surprise, the room was dusty and untidy. 
The windows were tightly closed and some of the  

1800
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:18,480
flowers were dead. I rang the bell for a maid 
and when she came, I spoke to her angrily.  

1801
02:34:19,439 --> 02:34:22,080
I wondered why I had been 
frightened of the servants before.

1802
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:27,840
The menu for the day lay on the desk. 
It was the same food as the day before.  

1803
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,480
I crossed everything out and rang for Robert.

1804
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:34,480
'Tell Mrs Danvers to order 
something different,' I told him.  

1805
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:40,800
Then I went out into the garden and cut some 
roses. Very soon Maxim will be back, I thought.  

1806
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:48,160
I must be calm and quiet. I took the roses back 
into the morning-room. It was clean and tidy now.

1807
02:34:49,439 --> 02:34:52,160
As I began to arrange the flowers, 
there was a knock at the door.

1808
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:57,840
It was Mrs Danvers, holding the menu 
in her hand. She looked pale and tired.

1809
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:04,720
'I don't understand,' she said. 'I'm not 
used to having messages sent by Robert.  

1810
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:09,120
When Mrs de Winter wanted any change 
in the menu, she spoke to me herself.'

1811
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:15,120
'I am Mrs de Winter now, Mrs Danvers,' I 
said. 'And I shall do things in my own way.'

1812
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:17,839
Mrs Danvers stared at me.

1813
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,000
'Is it true,' she asked slowly,  

1814
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:27,360
'that Mrs de Winter's boat has been found 
and that there was a body in the cabin?'

1815
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:31,120
'I am afraid I don't know 
anything about that,' I said.

1816
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:38,241
'Don't you?' Mrs Danvers said. She 
stood looking at me. I turned away.

1817
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:42,560
'I will give orders about the lunch,' she said.  

1818
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:47,440
She waited, but I did not say 
anything. She went out of the room.

1819
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:54,240
Mrs Danvers did not frighten me any more. 
She was my enemy and I did not care.  

1820
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,559
But if she learnt the truth about Rebecca's 
death, she would become Maxim's enemy too.  

1821
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:04,480
I suddenly felt sick and ill. I went out on 
to the terrace and began to walk up and down.

1822
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:08,400
At half past eleven, Maxim 
phoned me from Frank's office.  

1823
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,920
He told me he was bringing Colonel 
Julyan and Frank back for lunch.

1824
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:17,520
The time dragged by. At five to one, I 
heard the sound of a car in the drive.  

1825
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:22,080
Maxim came into the hall with 
Frank and Colonel Julyan.

1826
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:26,559
Colonel Julyan, the magistrate, was a 
middle-aged man with a kind face and grey hair.

1827
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,760
'This is most unpleasant for you and 
your husband,' Colonel Julyan said to me.  

1828
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,000
'I feel very sorry for both of you.'

1829
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:40,399
Maxim and Frank went on into the dining-room and 
Colonel Julyan continued to speak to me quietly.

1830
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:46,000
'We found a body in the boat this morning. 
It is the body of the late Mrs de Winter.  

1831
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:51,360
As you know, Mr de Winter identified the 
other body found in the sea as his wife.  

1832
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:54,479
That makes things rather difficult for us now.'

1833
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:58,320
The Colonel stopped suddenly as 
Maxim came back into the hall.

1834
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:01,920
'Lunch is ready; shall we go in?' he said.

1835
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:08,000
I did not look at Maxim during lunch. We talked 
about the weather and Colonel Julyan asked me  

1836
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:13,359
about my life in France. Frith and Robert were in 
the room and no one wanted to talk about the boat.  

1837
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:17,840
At last Frith served coffee 
and the servants left us.

1838
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:22,240
'I wish an inquest wasn't 
necessary,' Colonel Julyan said,  

1839
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:26,000
'but I'm afraid it is. I don't 
think it will take very long.  

1840
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:30,960
De Winter will have to say that the body in 
the boat was the late Mrs de Winter. Then the  

1841
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:35,760
boat-builder will say that the boat was in good 
order when he last saw it. This must be done.'

1842
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:40,639
'That's quite all right,' 
Maxim said. 'We understand.'

1843
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,439
'I suppose Mrs de Winter had to go down into 
the cabin for something. Then the door shut and,  

1844
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:52,240
somehow, she was trapped there. Don't you 
think so, Crawley?' the Colonel asked Frank.

1845
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:58,399
'Oh yes, of course,' said Frank. I had a 
sudden feeling that Frank knew the truth.

1846
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,920
'The inquest will be on Tuesday 
afternoon,' Colonel Julyan told us.  

1847
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:08,240
'We'll keep it as short as possible, but 
I'm afraid the reporters will be there.'

1848
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:10,559
There was another silence.

1849
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:13,840
'Shall we go into the garden?' I said.

1850
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:18,640
We all stood on the terrace for a moment 
and then Colonel Julyan looked at his watch.

1851
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:23,520
'Thank you for the lunch,' he said 
to me. 'I'm afraid I must leave now.  

1852
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,519
Would you like a lift, Crawley?'

1853
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:31,040
Maxim walked with them to the car. When they 
had gone, he came back to me on the terrace.

1854
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:36,319
'It's going to be all right,' Maxim said. 
'There won't be any trouble at the inquest.  

1855
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:40,640
There is nothing to show what I did. 
Colonel Julyan thinks she was trapped  

1856
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,480
in the cabin and the jury will think that too.'

1857
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:44,400
I said nothing.

1858
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:50,880
'It's you I'm sorry for,' Maxim told me 
sadly. 'I don't care about anything else.  

1859
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:57,840
I'm glad that I killed Rebecca. But I can't forget 
what this has done to you. You have lost that  

1860
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:04,640
young, sweet look. And it will never come back. In 
twenty-four hours, you have grown so much older.'

1861
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:09,840
Frith brought in the newspapers 
at breakfast the following day.  

1862
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:15,200
The story was in all of them. There was a 
picture of Manderley and an awful one of Maxim.  

1863
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:19,840
All the papers said that Rebecca's body 
had been found after the Fancy Dress Ball.  

1864
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:26,240
They said how everyone had loved Rebecca. They all 
said that Maxim had married his young, second wife  

1865
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:32,639
within a year of Rebecca's death. It all made a 
good story. Maxim's face went whiter and whiter.

1866
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:36,319
I wondered what the papers would 
say if they knew the truth.  

1867
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:40,880
That terrible word - murder - 
would be on every front page.

1868
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:46,719
Frank was a great help to us. We had no more 
phone calls from reporters and no visitors.  

1869
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,840
It was just a question of waiting 
- of waiting until Tuesday.

1870
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:55,440
Maxim and I stayed quietly in 
the house or in the gardens.  

1871
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:58,399
We did not walk in the 
woods or go down to the sea.  

1872
02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:05,839
The weather was very hot and the air was heavy. 
There were clouds, but the rain did not fall.
 
 

1873
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:17,200
CHAPTER TWENTY

1874
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:19,840
The Inquest

1875
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:24,559
Tuesday came at last. The 
inquest was at two o'clock.  

1876
02:40:25,359 --> 02:40:27,839
After an early lunch, I drove 
into the town with Maxim.

1877
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:34,080
'I think I shall stay here in the car,' I 
said. 'I won't come in with you after all.'

1878
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:38,399
'I didn't want you to come,' Maxim said. 
'I wish you had stayed at Manderley.'

1879
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:43,760
Maxim went off and left me sitting 
there. The minutes went by.  

1880
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:49,120
I wondered what was happening at the inquest. I 
got out of the car and began walking up and down.

1881
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:51,279
A policeman looked at me.

1882
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:58,319
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said. 'Aren't you Mrs 
de Winter? You can wait inside if you like.'

1883
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:03,680
The policeman took me into an empty room. 
Five minutes passed. Nothing happened.  

1884
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:08,160
I got up and walked out of the little room. 
The policeman was still standing there.

1885
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,200
'How long will they be?' I asked him.

1886
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,240
'I'll go and see if you like,' the policeman 
said. He was back again in a moment.

1887
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:23,200
'It won't last much longer,' he told me. 'Mr de 
Winter has just finished giving his evidence.  

1888
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,760
There's only the boat-builder, 
Mr Tabb, to speak now.  

1889
02:41:26,479 --> 02:41:29,839
Would you like to go in? There's 
an empty seat near the door.'

1890
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:36,800
I followed the policeman. He opened the door 
for me and I went in quietly and sat down. The  

1891
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:44,560
room was small and full of people. The air was hot 
and stuffy. Frank was sitting next to Maxim. To my  

1892
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:50,960
surprise, Mrs Danvers was there too, with Favell 
beside her. I wondered whether Maxim had seen him.

1893
02:41:52,399 --> 02:41:58,240
Tabb, the boat-builder, standing in the centre of 
the room, was answering the Coroner's questions.

1894
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:01,439
'Was the boat in good condition?' 
the Coroner was asking.

1895
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:05,680
'Yes, it certainly was the last time I saw it,'  

1896
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:11,840
Tabb said. 'It was a strong little boat. I 
can't understand why it sank that night.'

1897
02:42:13,279 --> 02:42:15,679
'Accidents have happened 
before,' the Coroner said.  

1898
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:19,520
'Mrs de Winter was careless 
for a moment and she died.'

1899
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:25,840
'Excuse me, sir,' said the boat-builder. 
'I would like to say something else.'

1900
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,840
'Very well, go on,' said the Coroner.

1901
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:36,319
'It's this, sir. There was nothing wrong 
with that boat when I last saw it. So  

1902
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:43,279
what I want to know is this. Who made those 
holes in the planks? Rocks didn't do it.  

1903
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,960
The boat sank too far away from them. And 
those holes were mad with something sharp.'

1904
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:53,840
I could not look at anyone. 
I stared down at the floor.

1905
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:57,040
For a moment, the Coroner 
was too surprised to speak.  

1906
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:01,600
Then he said, 'What do you 
mean? What sort of holes?'

1907
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:05,840
'There were three of them, in 
different parts of the boat.  

1908
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:10,720
And that's not all. The sea-cocks 
had been turned full on.'

1909
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:15,649
'The sea-cocks? What are they?' asked the Coroner.

1910
02:43:15,649 --> 02:43:19,680
'The sea-cocks close the pipes 
leading to the wash-basins, sir.  

1911
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:25,920
They must be kept tightly closed when the boat 
is sailing. Otherwise the sea water comes in.'

1912
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:31,760
It was hot in that crowded room, far too 
hot. I wished someone would open a window.  

1913
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:33,920
The boat-builder was speaking again.

1914
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:40,880
'With those holes, sir, and the sea-cocks open, 
a small boat like Mrs de Winter's would soon  

1915
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:46,960
sink. It's my opinion that there was no 
accident. That boat was sunk on purpose.'

1916
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:53,279
I must try and get out of the door, 
I thought. There was no air. People  

1917
02:43:53,279 --> 02:43:58,160
were standing up and talking loudly. I 
heard the Coroner say, 'Mr de Winter.'

1918
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:01,759
Maxim was standing up. I could not look at him.

1919
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:04,800
'Mr de Winter,' the Coroner said,  

1920
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:09,599
'you have heard James Tabb's evidence. 
Do you know anything about those holes?'

1921
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,380
'Nothing.'

1922
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,081
'Can you think why they are there?'

1923
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:16,559
'No, of course not.'

1924
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:20,319
'This news is a shock to you, of course?'

1925
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:25,201
'Of course it is a shock. Does it 
surprise you that I am shocked?'

1926
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:27,840
Maxim's voice was hard and angry.

1927
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,840
Oh God, I thought, don't 
let Maxim lose his temper.

1928
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:34,240
The Coroner was speaking again.

1929
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:39,599
'Mr de Winter, I want to find out 
exactly how your late wife died.  

1930
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:42,160
Who looked after Mrs de Winter's boat?'

1931
02:44:43,279 --> 02:44:44,559
'She looked after it herself.'

1932
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:52,000
'Then whoever took the boat out that night also 
made those holes and opened the sea-cocks.'

1933
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:53,920
'I suppose so.'

1934
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:58,799
'You have told us that the door and 
windows of the cabin were shut?'

1935
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:00,260
'Yes.'

1936
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:03,920
'Doesn't this seem very 
strange to you, Mr de Winter?'

1937
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:05,760
'Yes, it does.'

1938
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:10,240
'Mr de Winter, I'm afraid I 
must ask you one other question.  

1939
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:14,720
Were you and the late Mrs 
de Winter happily married?'

1940
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:20,479
It was hot, so hot. I tried 
to stand up, but I could not.  

1941
02:45:21,279 --> 02:45:25,759
The ground came up to meet me. And then 
I heard Maxim's voice, clear and strong.

1942
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:29,440
'Will someone take my wife 
outside? She is going to faint.'

1943
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:35,120
I was sitting in the little 
room again. Frank was beside me.

1944
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:39,680
'I'm sorry,' I said. 'It was so hot in there.'

1945
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,760
'Are you feeling better, 
Mrs de Winter?' Frank asked.  

1946
02:45:44,399 --> 02:45:48,799
'Maxim has told me to take you back to 
Manderley.' Frank helped me to get up.

1947
02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:53,440
'I'd much rather stay,' I said. 
'I want to wait for Maxim.'

1948
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:59,920
'Maxim may be some time,' Frank told me. 
'They may have to go over the evidence again.'

1949
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:02,320
'But what are they trying to find out?'

1950
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:07,679
Frank did not answer. We were in his 
car now and he was driving very fast.

1951
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:13,279
'Did you see Favell there?' I asked. 
'He was sitting with Mrs Danvers.  

1952
02:46:14,319 --> 02:46:16,719
I don't trust them, Frank. 
They might make trouble.'

1953
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:23,840
Frank did not answer. He could not know how much 
Maxim had told me. Then we were back at Manderley.

1954
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:30,000
'Will you be all right now?' Frank asked 
me. 'I shall go back. Maxim may want me.'  

1955
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:33,439
He got quickly back into the 
car again and drove away.

1956
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:40,399
I went upstairs to my room, and lay down on 
my bed. What were they all saying now? What  

1957
02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:44,799
was happening? What would I do if Frank 
came back to Manderley without Maxim?  

1958
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:48,560
I thought again of that dreadful word - murder.  

1959
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:53,760
God, let me not think about it. Let me 
think about something else, anything...

1960
02:46:56,720 --> 02:47:03,760
I must have fallen asleep. I woke up suddenly. It 
was five o'clock. I got up and went to the window.  

1961
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:08,240
There was no wind. Lightning 
flashed against the grey sky.  

1962
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:13,200
I heard thunder in the distance. 
A few drops of rain began to fall.

1963
02:47:14,479 --> 02:47:19,839
I went downstairs and sat 
with Jasper in the library.
 
 

1964
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,560
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE

1965
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:30,000
A Visit From Jack Favell

1966
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:34,800
It was after six when I heard 
the sound of Maxim's car.  

1967
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,520
I tried to stand up but my legs were so 
weak that I had to lean against a chair.  

1968
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:45,120
Maxim came into the room and stood 
by the door. He looked tired and old.

1969
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:52,559
'It's all over,' he said. I waited. I 
could not speak or walk towards him.

1970
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:59,360
'Suicide,' Maxim said. 'That's the verdict. 
They said that Rebecca killed herself.'

1971
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:06,880
I sat down. 'Suicide,' I repeated. 
'Why do they think Rebecca did that?'

1972
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:10,000
'God knows,' Maxim said.  

1973
02:48:11,279 --> 02:48:17,439
He went and stood by the window. 'There's one more 
thing to be done. Rebecca's body has to be buried.  

1974
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:22,161
I'm going down to the church now. We'll 
talk about everything when I get back.  

1975
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:29,759
We've got to start our lives all over again. The 
past can't hurt us if we are together. We'll have  

1976
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:35,840
children too, I promise you. I must go now. I'm 
meeting Frank and Colonel Julyan at the church.'  

1977
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:40,879
He left the room quickly and then I 
heard the sound of his car driving away.

1978
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:47,760
It was quiet in the library. I thought about the 
church where Rebecca was being buried at last.

1979
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:54,160
Just before seven, the rain began to fall 
heavily. I opened the windows to let in the  

1980
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:59,279
cold, clean air. The rain was falling so 
heavily that I did not hear Frith come in.

1981
02:49:00,720 --> 02:49:07,280
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said. 'There's a 
gentleman to see Mr de Winter. It's Mr Favell.'

1982
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:09,600
I was very surprised.

1983
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:15,439
'I think I had better see Mr Favell,' 
I said. 'Bring him in here, please,  

1984
02:49:15,439 --> 02:49:22,559
Frith.' I hoped that Favell would go before Maxim 
came back. I could not think why Favell had come.

1985
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:28,000
'I'm afraid Maxim is not here,' I 
said, when Favell walked into the room.  

1986
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:32,240
His eyes were red. I wondered 
if he had been drinking.

1987
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:38,559
'I don't mind waiting,' Favell replied. 
'Max will be back for dinner, I'm sure.'

1988
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:44,320
'Mr Favell,' I said. 'I don't want 
to be rude, but I am very tired.  

1989
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,040
It will be better if you 
come back in the morning.'

1990
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:52,160
'No, no,' he said, coming towards me, 
'I've got something to say to Max.  

1991
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:56,480
This has been a shock to me, you 
know. I was very fond of Rebecca.'

1992
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:00,319
'Yes, of course,' I said. 
'I'm very sorry for you.'

1993
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:04,639
'I was fonder of Rebecca than 
of anyone else in the world,'  

1994
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:10,000
Favell went on. 'And she was fond of me. That's 
why I've come here to find out the truth.  

1995
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:16,240
Suicide... my God. You and I know 
it wasn't suicide, don't we?'

1996
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:22,240
As Favell was speaking, the door 
opened and Maxim and Frank came in.

1997
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:25,120
'What the hell are you doing 
here?' Maxim said to Favell.

1998
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:32,240
'Why, hello, Max, old man,' Favell said. 'You 
must be feeling very pleased with yourself.'

1999
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:38,320
'Do you mind leaving the house?' said 
Maxim coldly. 'I don't want you here.'

2000
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:46,000
'Now, wait a minute, Max,' Favell answered. 
'You've been very lucky. But I can still  

2001
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:52,000
make life unpleasant for you. And dangerous 
too, perhaps.' Maxim stared hard at Favell.

2002
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:57,040
'Oh yes?' he said. 'In what way 
can you make things dangerous?'

2003
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:02,640
'I'll tell you, Max,' said 
Favell with an unpleasant smile.  

2004
02:51:03,439 --> 02:51:07,200
'You know all about Rebecca and 
me. Her death was a great shock.  

2005
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:12,240
Then I read about Rebecca's boat and 
the body in the cabin. So I went to the  

2006
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:17,840
inquest. I heard the boat-builder's evidence. 
What about those holes in the boat, Max?'

2007
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:24,720
'You heard the verdict,' Maxim told him. 'I 
have nothing more to say.' Favell laughed.

2008
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:30,880
'You know Rebecca didn't kill herself. I've 
a note here that may interest you. I kept  

2009
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:34,080
it because it was the last thing 
Rebecca ever wrote to me. Listen.'

2010
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:40,400
Favell took a piece of paper from his pocket. 
I recognized Rebecca's hard, black writing.

2011
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,960
"I tried to phone you," Favell 
read, "but you were out.  

2012
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:49,680
I'm leaving London now and going back 
to Manderley. I'll wait for you in  

2013
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:55,760
the cottage. Come down as soon as you 
can. I've got something to tell you." '

2014
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,600
Favell put the note back in his pocket.

2015
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:03,201
'I found that in my London flat. It was 
too late to drive down to Manderley.  

2016
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:06,160
When I phoned the following day, Rebecca was dead.  

2017
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:09,840
Do you really think Rebecca killed 
herself after writing that note?'

2018
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,240
Maxim said nothing.

2019
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:21,279
'Now, Max, old man,' Favell said at last, 
'you know I'm not a rich man. If I had two  

2020
02:52:21,279 --> 02:52:28,080
or three thousand pounds, I could live quite 
well. I'd never come back, I promise you.'

2021
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:32,960
'I've already asked you to leave the house,' 
Maxim said. 'The door is behind you.'

2022
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:35,040
Favell laughed again.

2023
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:38,399
'Think again, Max,' said Favell.  

2024
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:43,200
'I don't suppose your new bride wants 
to be known as the wife of a murderer.'

2025
02:52:44,399 --> 02:52:47,120
'You can't frighten me, Favell,' Maxim answered.  

2026
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:51,279
'Shall I phone Colonel Julyan? 
You can tell your story to him.'

2027
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:58,080
'You wouldn't dare, Max,' said Favell. 'I 
have enough evidence to hang you, Max.'

2028
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:02,000
Maxim walked slowly towards 
the telephone in the next room.

2029
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:05,440
'Stop him,' I said to Frank. 
'Stop him for God's sake.'  

2030
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,640
But it was too late. Maxim was already speaking.

2031
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:14,320
'Is that Colonel Julyan? It's de Winter here. 
Could you come over to Manderley at once?  

2032
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:19,519
No - I can't say anything over the 
phone. Thank you very much, goodbye.'

2033
02:53:21,359 --> 02:53:24,240
Maxim came back again into the room.

2034
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:26,719
'Colonel Julyan will be here 
in ten minutes,' he said.

2035
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:32,319
We waited in silence. The rain was so heavy 
that we did not hear the sound of the car.  

2036
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:36,720
We were taken by surprise when Frith 
brought the magistrate into the library.

2037
02:53:37,760 --> 02:53:40,560
'Good evening, Colonel 
Julyan,' Maxim said at once.  

2038
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:45,359
'This is Jack Favell, my late wife's 
cousin. He has something to say to you.'

2039
02:53:46,319 --> 02:53:51,040
Favell went up to Colonel Julyan. 
'I'm not happy about the verdict.  

2040
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:56,399
I want you to read this note. Tell me whether you 
think the writer had decided to kill herself.'  

2041
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,920
Colonel Julyan took the note and read it slowly.

2042
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:05,840
'I see what you mean,' he said. 
'But the note is not clear.  

2043
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:11,200
What do you think really happened to 
Mrs de Winter?' Favell looked at Maxim.

2044
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:18,800
'I'll tell you what I think,' he said slowly. 
'Rebecca never opened those sea-cocks.  

2045
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:23,359
She didn't make those holes in the 
boat. Rebecca didn't kill herself.  

2046
02:54:23,359 --> 02:54:28,880
I say she was murdered. Do you want to 
know who the murderer is? He's there,  

2047
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:36,480
standing by the window. Mr Maximilian de Winter 
- he's your murderer. Take a good look at him.'

2048
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:47,840
Favell began to laugh, a high stupid laugh, as he 
twisted the note round and round in his fingers.
 
 

2049
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,760
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

2050
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:02,880
Rebecca's Diary

2051
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:11,359
Thank God for Favell's laugh. I saw a look 
of disgust come into Colonel Julyan's face.

2052
02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:15,839
'The man's drunk,' he said quickly. 
'He doesn't know what he's saying.'

2053
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:19,760
'Drunk, am I?' shouted Favell. 'Oh no,  

2054
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:24,240
I'm not drunk. Max de Winter murdered 
Rebecca, and I'm going to prove it.'

2055
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:29,840
'Wait a minute,' said Colonel 
Julyan. 'I want to hear your proof.'

2056
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:35,600
'Proof?' said Favell. 'Aren't those 
holes in the boat enough proof for you?'

2057
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:41,600
'Certainly not,' said Colonel Julyan. 'Unless 
you can find someone who saw him do it.'

2058
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:49,279
'I'll get your proof for you,' shouted Favell. 
'De Winter killed Rebecca because of me.  

2059
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:55,359
He was jealous because she loved me. He went 
down to the cottage and killed her there.  

2060
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:59,520
Wait a minute... I think I 
can find someone who saw him.'

2061
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:03,760
I suddenly knew what Favell meant. Someone had  

2062
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:08,400
seen it all happen - someone who was 
often down there in the bay - Ben.

2063
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:13,520
'There's an idiot who was always 
around the cottage,' Favell said.  

2064
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:16,800
'He often slept on the beach. 
I'm sure he saw everything.'

2065
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:21,200
'Can we get this man and question 
him?' asked Colonel Julyan.

2066
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:27,600
'Of course,' said Maxim. 'His name 
is Ben. Could you go and get him,  

2067
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:34,800
Frank? Take your car.' Frank went out quickly. 
Favell laughed angrily. His face was very red.  

2068
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:40,319
'You all help each other down here, don't 
you?' he said. 'Crawley knows the truth,  

2069
02:56:40,319 --> 02:56:45,040
I'm sure. He'll be there to hold the young 
bride's arm when Max is sentenced to death.'

2070
02:56:46,319 --> 02:56:49,439
Without warning, Maxim went 
up to Favell and hit him hard.  

2071
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:54,399
Favell fell heavily to the floor. I 
wished that Maxim had not hit him.  

2072
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:59,680
Favell got slowly to his feet, walked over to 
a small table and poured himself some whisky.  

2073
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:05,840
I saw Colonel Julyan look thoughtfully at Maxim. 
Was he beginning to believe Favell's story?

2074
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:08,560
The door opened and Frank came in.

2075
02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:13,359
'All right, Ben,' he said 
quietly. 'Don't be frightened.'

2076
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:19,600
Ben stepped into the room and stared at everyone 
with his small eyes. Favell walked up to him.

2077
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:24,800
'You know who I am, don't you?' 
he said. Ben did not answer.

2078
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:29,520
'Come on,' said Favell. 'You've seen 
me in the cottage, haven't you?'

2079
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:37,680
Ben held Frank's arm. 'I've never seen him,' 
he said. 'Is he going to take me away?'

2080
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:45,680
'No, of course not,' said Colonel Julyan. 
'Now listen to me, Ben. You remember the lady  

2081
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:50,400
with the boat. Were you on the beach when 
she took her boat out for the last time?'

2082
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:55,200
'You were there, weren't you?' 
said Favell, standing over Ben.  

2083
02:57:56,080 --> 02:58:01,439
'You saw Mrs de Winter go into the cottage 
and Mr de Winter too. What happened then?'

2084
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:04,880
Ben shook his head and 
moved back against the wall.  

2085
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:09,920
'I didn't see anything,' he said. He began to cry.

2086
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:15,920
'You damned little idiot,' Favell said slowly.

2087
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:20,800
'I think Ben can go home now, 
don't you, Colonel Julyan?'  

2088
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:25,279
Maxim said. Frank took Ben out of the 
room as the Colonel nodded his head.

2089
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:29,120
'That poor fellow was terrified,' he said.  

2090
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:33,600
'He's no use to you, Favell. I'm 
afraid you can't prove your story.'

2091
02:58:34,880 --> 02:58:38,240
Favell did not answer. Instead, he rang the bell  

2092
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:42,399
and when Frith came in, he said, 'Ask 
Mrs Danvers to come here, Frith.'

2093
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:48,560
'Isn't Mrs Danvers the housekeeper?' asked 
Colonel Julyan as Frith left the room.

2094
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:56,560
'She was also Rebecca's friend. She knew her for 
years,' Favell said, with his unpleasant smile.

2095
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:02,320
We all waited, watching the door. Then Mrs 
Danvers came in and shut the door behind her.

2096
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,480
'Good evening, Mrs Danvers,' Colonel Julyan said.  

2097
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:11,679
'I would like to ask you a question. 
You knew the late Mrs de Winter well.  

2098
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:17,840
Mr Favell has told us that Mrs de Winter 
was in love with him. Is that true?'

2099
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:22,240
'No, it is not,' Mrs Danvers answered.

2100
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:27,840
'Now, listen, Danny,' Favell began to 
shout, but Mrs Danvers took no notice.

2101
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:34,080
'She was not in love with you, Mr Jack. Or 
with Mr de Winter. She was not in love with  

2102
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:39,279
anyone. She thought men were fools. She 
amused herself with you, that was all.'

2103
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:45,840
Maxim went very white. Favell stared at Mrs 
Danvers as though he did not understand her.

2104
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:49,920
'Mrs Danvers,' Colonel Julyan said quietly,  

2105
02:59:50,720 --> 02:59:54,160
'can you think of any reason why 
Mrs de Winter killed herself?'

2106
02:59:55,200 --> 03:00:00,240
Mrs Danvers shook her head. 
'No, certainly not,' she said.

2107
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:04,640
'There you are! What did I 
tell you?' Favell shouted.

2108
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:11,599
'Be quiet, will you. Let Mrs Danvers read the 
note. She may understand it,' Colonel Julyan said.  

2109
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:15,920
Mrs Danvers took the note, read 
it and then shook her head again.

2110
03:00:17,439 --> 03:00:21,759
'I don't know what she meant. If it was 
something important, she would have told me.'

2111
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:26,399
'Can you tell us how Mrs de Winter 
spent that last day in London?  

2112
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:30,000
Did she keep a diary?' asked Colonel Julyan.

2113
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:34,559
'I've got her diary in my 
room,' Mrs Danvers replied.  

2114
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:37,840
'I kept all her things. I'll go and get it.'

2115
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:44,480
'Well, de Winter,' said Colonel Julyan, 
'do you mind us seeing this diary?'

2116
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:51,840
'Of course not,' said Maxim. Once again, I 
saw Colonel Julyan give Maxim a hard look.  

2117
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:57,759
This time Frank saw it too. Somehow I felt 
sure that the truth was in that diary.

2118
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:01,599
Mrs Danvers came back with 
a small book in her hand.

2119
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:08,880
'Here is the page for the day Mrs de Winter died,' 
she said. Colonel Julyan looked at it carefully.

2120
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:16,399
'Yes,' he said, 'here it is. Hairdressers 
at twelve o'clock. Then lunch. And  

2121
03:01:16,399 --> 03:01:24,399
then - Baker - two o'clock. Who was Baker?' 
He looked at Maxim. Maxim shook his head.

2122
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:29,920
'Baker?' repeated Mrs Danvers. 
'She knew no one called Baker.'

2123
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:34,399
'We must find out who this 
person was,' said Colonel Julyan.  

2124
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:38,719
'If he wasn't a friend, perhaps 
it was someone she was afraid of.'

2125
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:46,160
'Mrs de Winter afraid?' said Mrs Danvers. 
'She was afraid of nothing and no one.  

2126
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:52,480
Only one thing worried her. That was the 
thought of illness, of dying slowly in her bed.'

2127
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:59,360
'What does all this matter?' said Favell. 'If 
Baker was important Danny would know about him.'  

2128
03:02:00,319 --> 03:02:02,719
Mrs Danvers was turning the pages of the diary.

2129
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:08,161
'There's a telephone number here at the 
back,' she said. 'And the name Baker again.'

2130
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:14,400
'Well,' said Maxim, lighting a cigarette. 
'Perhaps someone should phone that number.  

2131
03:02:15,120 --> 03:02:16,160
Would you mind, Frank?'

2132
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:22,960
Frank took the diary without a word and went 
into the next room. He shut the door behind him.  

2133
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:27,680
When he came back, he said, 
'That was a doctor's number.  

2134
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:30,640
Dr Baker used to live there, 
but he left six months ago.  

2135
03:02:31,840 --> 03:02:37,279
They gave me his new address. I have written 
it here.' And Frank held out a piece of paper.

2136
03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:43,839
It was then that Maxim looked at me. He looked at 
me like a man saying goodbye for the last time.  

2137
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:47,519
That piece of paper was enough to hang Maxim.

2138
03:02:49,359 --> 03:02:53,759
I knew why Rebecca had gone to a doctor. 
I knew what she had wanted to tell Favell.  

2139
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:58,000
Rebecca had been pregnant when 
she died. She had been going  

2140
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:02,880
to have a child. It was the one clear 
proof that Rebecca had not killed herself.

2141
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:08,000
I was sure that this was the 
truth. I knew Maxim thought so too.

2142
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:14,000
'Well done, Frank,' said Maxim calmly. 
'Where does the doctor live now?'

2143
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:22,799
'In north London,' Frank replied. 'But he's not on 
the phone. He's a very well-known women's doctor.'

2144
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:27,920
'Well,' said Colonel Julyan. 'There must have 
been something wrong with her after all.'

2145
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:31,439
'I'll write him a letter,' Frank said.

2146
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:35,200
'I don't think he would tell 
you anything,' Colonel Julyan  

2147
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:38,399
answered. 'I think de Winter 
should see him and explain.'

2148
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:44,241
'I'm ready to go,' said Maxim quietly. 
'Shall I go up in the morning?'

2149
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:49,680
'He's not going alone,' Favell said 
with a laugh. 'You go with him,  

2150
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:54,080
Julyan. And I think I'd better 
go too. What time do we start?'

2151
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:55,680
Colonel Julyan looked at Maxim.

2152
03:03:56,800 --> 03:04:00,400
'Nine o'clock?' he said. 'Perhaps 
you will take me in your car.'

2153
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:06,081
'We'll meet at the crossroads just after 
nine,' Favell said. He walked to the door.

2154
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:10,160
'I suppose you're not going to ask 
me to dinner, so I'll say goodbye.  

2155
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:13,920
Come on, Danny. I'll see you in the morning, Max.'

2156
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:17,200
Colonel Julyan came up to me and took my hand.

2157
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:22,160
'Good night,' he said. 'Get 
your husband to bed early.  

2158
03:04:22,160 --> 03:04:26,479
Tomorrow will be a long day.' 
He held my hand for a moment,  

2159
03:04:26,479 --> 03:04:32,719
but he did not look into my eyes. He and Frank 
went out together. Maxim and I were alone at last.

2160
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:36,720
'I'm coming with you tomorrow,' I said.

2161
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:41,760
'Yes,' Maxim answered. 'We must 
be together as long as we can.'

2162
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:49,200
I put my arms around him and held him. We 
did not say anything. Then Maxim held me  

2163
03:04:49,200 --> 03:05:03,840
tightly. We began to kiss each other, like 
guilty lovers who had never kissed before.
 
 

2164
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:12,720
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE

2165
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:13,440
Dr Baker

2166
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:18,240
I woke up early the following 
morning at about six o'clock.  

2167
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:22,479
I got up and went to the window. 
The trees were covered in mist.

2168
03:05:22,479 --> 03:05:26,080
There was a sharp coolness in 
the air. Autumn had arrived.

2169
03:05:27,359 --> 03:05:32,319
This was the start of a new day at Manderley. 
Soon the servants would be starting work.  

2170
03:05:33,520 --> 03:05:39,680
Whatever happened to us, life at Manderley would 
go on. The peace of Manderley could not be broken.  

2171
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:44,719
Its beauty could not be destroyed. 
The flowers would come every year,  

2172
03:05:44,720 --> 03:05:50,320
the birds would sing. Manderley would always be 
here, safe and secure, within sound of the sea.

2173
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:57,200
Maxim slept on and I did not wake him. 
The day ahead would be long and tiring.  

2174
03:05:57,200 --> 03:06:02,000
London was many miles away. We did not know 
what we should find at the end of the journey.

2175
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:08,399
Somewhere in London lived a man called 
Baker. He had never heard of us.  

2176
03:06:08,399 --> 03:06:10,000
But our future was in his hands.

2177
03:06:11,439 --> 03:06:17,599
I had a bath, dressed and then woke Maxim. He 
got up and went into the bathroom. I began to  

2178
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:23,279
pack a few things. We might have to stay 
overnight in London. I looked at my small  

2179
03:06:23,279 --> 03:06:29,840
case. It seemed so long since I had used it. But 
it was only four months. I could not believe it.

2180
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:34,161
We had breakfast together and 
I went out on to the terrace.  

2181
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:38,480
The air was fresh and clear now. 
It was going to be a perfect day.  

2182
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:43,280
At nine o'clock exactly, Frank 
brought up Colonel Julyan in his car.

2183
03:06:44,319 --> 03:06:49,040
We were going in Maxim's car. I sat beside 
Maxim and Colonel Julyan got into the back.

2184
03:06:50,319 --> 03:06:53,759
'You will telephone, won't you?' 
Frank said as he stood on the steps.

2185
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:59,520
'Yes, of course,' Maxim said. As we 
drove away, I looked back at the house.  

2186
03:07:00,319 --> 03:07:05,120
It had never looked more beautiful. For 
some reason, my eyes filled with tears.  

2187
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:09,840
Then we were round the bend of the drive 
and I could see the house no longer.

2188
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:13,440
When we came to the crossroads, 
Favell was already waiting.  

2189
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:19,279
He waved when he saw us and started up his car. 
I settled down for the long journey to London.  

2190
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:24,960
The hours passed and the miles went 
by, Favell's car always behind us.

2191
03:07:26,240 --> 03:07:31,200
We had lunch somewhere and reached London at 
about three o'clock. It was then that I began to  

2192
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:37,519
feel tired. It was warm and the streets were busy. 
The drive through the centre of London seemed very  

2193
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:44,880
long. Maxim looked pale and tired, but he did not 
say anything. Favell's car was always behind us.

2194
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:52,080
We reached Baker's house at about five o'clock. 
Maxim stopped the car and we got out. Favell came  

2195
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:58,080
up to meet us. We all walked slowly up the path 
to the front door. Colonel Julyan rang the bell.

2196
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:00,399
A woman opened the door.

2197
03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:07,040
'Is Dr Baker at home?' said Colonel Julyan. 
'He is expecting us. I sent a telegram.'

2198
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:14,000
'Yes, of course,' said the woman. 'My husband 
is in the garden. I'll tell him you are here.'

2199
03:08:15,359 --> 03:08:17,679
She took us into a cool room 
at the back of the house.  

2200
03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:21,679
She went out and in a few minutes 
a tall man came into the room.

2201
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:28,000
'I'm Dr Baker. I'm sorry to keep you 
waiting. Please sit down,' he said.

2202
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:35,720
'We are sorry to trouble you, Dr Baker,' Colonel 
Julyan said. 'My name is Julyan. This is Mr de  

2203
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:41,840
Winter, Mrs de Winter and Mr Favell. We have 
come about the death of the late Mrs de Winter.  

2204
03:08:42,560 --> 03:08:44,640
You may have read the report in the papers.'

2205
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:51,040
'The verdict was suicide,' Favell said. 'I 
knew Mrs de Winter very well. She did not kill  

2206
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:56,560
herself. She had no reason to. We want to know 
why she came to see you on the day she died.'

2207
03:08:57,680 --> 03:09:02,000
Dr Baker looked surprised. 'I 
think you've made a mistake,'  

2208
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:05,279
he said. 'No one called de 
Winter has ever come to me.'

2209
03:09:06,720 --> 03:09:10,400
'But we found your old telephone 
number in Mrs de Winter's diary.'  

2210
03:09:11,359 --> 03:09:16,240
Dr Baker looked at the page from the diary 
that Colonel Julyan was holding out to him.

2211
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:18,800
'That certainly was my number,' he said.

2212
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:24,000
'Perhaps Mrs de Winter gave you a 
different name,' Colonel Julyan suggested.

2213
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:28,160
'It's possible,' said Dr Baker slowly.

2214
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:32,479
'If you have any record of a visit 
on that day, could we see it?'  

2215
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:36,000
Colonel Julyan asked. 'This 
is an important matter.'

2216
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:38,720
'Murder,' Favell said.

2217
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:43,840
'Of course,' said the doctor. 'I had 
no idea there was any question of that.  

2218
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:45,760
I'll go and get my book.'

2219
03:09:47,279 --> 03:09:49,679
While Dr Baker was out of 
the room, we said nothing.  

2220
03:09:50,560 --> 03:09:54,960
No one looked at anyone else. Favell 
whistled quietly under his breath.

2221
03:09:56,239 --> 03:09:58,559
Dr Baker came back into 
the room with a large book.  

2222
03:09:59,279 --> 03:10:03,120
He opened the book and turned the 
pages. We all stood watching his face.

2223
03:10:04,479 --> 03:10:09,519
'I saw a Mrs Danvers on the 12th at 
two o'clock,' Dr Baker said at last.

2224
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:15,200
'Danny? Why did...?' Favell began. Maxim broke in.

2225
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:20,880
'Rebecca gave the wrong name, of course,' 
he said. 'Do you remember the visit now,  

2226
03:10:20,880 --> 03:10:26,560
Doctor?' But Dr Baker was already searching 
his files. He picked out a card and read it.

2227
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:31,360
'Yes,' he said slowly, 'I remember now.'

2228
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:36,960
'Was she tall and dark, a beautiful 
woman?' Colonel Julyan asked.

2229
03:10:37,920 --> 03:10:44,720
'Yes,' said Dr Baker. He put back the card 
and looked at Maxim. The doctor spoke slowly.

2230
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:52,319
'The woman who called herself Mrs Danvers was 
very ill indeed. She had come to me the week  

2231
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:59,519
before. I took some X-rays. She had come back to 
hear the result. I remember her words exactly.  

2232
03:11:00,399 --> 03:11:07,839
"I want to know the truth," she said. "If I'm 
really ill, I want to know." So I told her.'

2233
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:10,800
Dr Baker stopped and looked down at the files.

2234
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:16,080
'There was nothing to be done,' he went 
on. 'An operation would have been useless.  

2235
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:21,840
I told her that. In six months, 
she would have been dead.'

2236
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:27,840
No one said a word and the doctor went 
on, 'Mrs de Winter looked a healthy woman.  

2237
03:11:28,399 --> 03:11:34,239
She had very little pain at that time. But 
the pain would have come. The X-rays showed  

2238
03:11:34,239 --> 03:11:38,479
that she could never have had a child. But 
that was nothing to do with her illness.'

2239
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:45,120
Everyone was standing up. We shook hands with Dr 
Baker and he walked with us to the front door.

2240
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:48,960
'Shall I send you my report?' Dr Baker asked.

2241
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:55,280
'We may not need it,' said Colonel Julyan. 'We'll 
write to you if we do. Thank you very much.'

2242
03:11:56,399 --> 03:12:03,839
'I am glad to have been of some use,' said 
Dr Baker. 'Goodbye.' And he shut the door.
 
 

2243
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:13,279
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR

2244
03:12:13,279 --> 03:12:14,719
The Return to Manderley

2245
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:21,120
We went and stood by the car. No 
one said anything for a few minutes.  

2246
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:25,680
Favell's face was grey. His hand 
shook as he lit a cigarette.

2247
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:32,720
'She kept it a secret from everyone, even Danny. 
It's been a dreadful shock to me,' Favell said.  

2248
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:36,640
'You're all right, of course, Max. 
You've been lucky, haven't you?  

2249
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:39,840
You and your young wife can 
go back to Manderley now.  

2250
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:46,000
You think you've won, but don't be too 
sure, I haven't finished with you yet.'

2251
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:49,920
'Shall we get into the car and 
go?' Colonel Julyan asked Maxim.  

2252
03:12:50,880 --> 03:12:56,400
Favell smiled unpleasantly. As we drove away, 
he was still standing there, watching us.

2253
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:00,880
'Favell can't do anything,' 
Colonel Julyan told us.  

2254
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:06,000
'I'll soon deal with him if he comes near 
Manderley again. I don't think the papers will  

2255
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:10,880
bother you any more. There may be some talk, but 
I'll make sure that people hear about Dr Baker.'

2256
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:14,160
'Thank you very much,' Maxim said.

2257
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:20,319
'What a dreadful thing illness is,' Colonel 
Julyan went on. 'I suppose she could not  

2258
03:13:20,319 --> 03:13:26,319
face the pain. She was such a lovely young 
woman, too.' Neither of us answered him.

2259
03:13:27,439 --> 03:13:31,599
Colonel Julyan's sister lived in London and 
he asked Maxim to take him to her house.

2260
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:37,200
'We must thank you for all your help,' Maxim 
said as the magistrate got out of the car.

2261
03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:40,960
'I've been glad to help. 
You must forget it all now.  

2262
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:46,960
Why don't you have a holiday, go abroad perhaps. 
Goodbye, both of you. It's been a long day.'

2263
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:53,120
As Maxim started up the car, I leant 
back in my seat and closed my eyes.  

2264
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:59,120
We drove on through the traffic and I felt 
full of peace. Nothing could hurt us any more.

2265
03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:03,439
We had dinner in a restaurant 
and Maxim phoned Frank.

2266
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:08,239
'Do you think Colonel Julyan knows 
the truth about Rebecca's death?'  

2267
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:10,319
I asked Maxim as we were drinking our coffee.

2268
03:14:11,359 --> 03:14:17,759
'Of course he knows,' Maxim said. 'But he will 
never say anything. I believe that Rebecca lied to  

2269
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:24,640
me on purpose. She wanted me to kill her. That's 
why she laughed. She was laughing when she died.'

2270
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:32,559
I did not say anything. It was all over. There was 
no need for Maxim to look so white and troubled.

2271
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:37,840
'I'm not sure that Rebecca hasn't 
won, even now,' Maxim went on.  

2272
03:14:38,560 --> 03:14:43,680
'Frank told me something rather strange on 
the phone. Mrs Danvers has left Manderley.  

2273
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:49,359
There was a long-distance call for her at 
six. By a quarter to seven, she had gone.'

2274
03:14:50,800 --> 03:14:56,960
'Isn't that a good thing?' I said. 'Favell phoned 
her, of course. But they can't do anything to us.'

2275
03:14:58,640 --> 03:15:02,560
I was glad that Mrs Danvers had 
gone. Manderley could be ours.  

2276
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:08,240
We would have people to stay. And soon, 
very soon Maxim and I would have children.

2277
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:12,480
'Have you finished your coffee?' 
Maxim said to me suddenly.  

2278
03:15:13,359 --> 03:15:18,399
'I feel that we must get back to Manderley as soon 
as possible. Something's wrong, I know it is.'

2279
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:21,520
'But you'll be so tired,' I said.

2280
03:15:22,239 --> 03:15:25,359
'No, I shall be all right. We can 
be at Manderley by two o'clock.'

2281
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:32,800
We went out to the car and Maxim covered me with 
a rug. It was dark now and I fell asleep almost  

2282
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:40,239
at once. I started to dream. I saw the staircase 
at Manderley and Mrs Danvers standing there in  

2283
03:15:40,239 --> 03:15:46,399
her long, black dress. Then, in my dream, 
I was alone in the woods near Manderley.  

2284
03:15:47,439 --> 03:15:50,319
I wanted to get to the Happy 
Valley, but I could not find it.  

2285
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:56,479
The dark trees were all round me. Then I 
was standing on the terrace. Moonlight shone  

2286
03:15:56,479 --> 03:16:01,839
on the windows. The gardens had gone and the 
dark woods came up to the walls of the house.

2287
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:04,160
I woke up suddenly.

2288
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:11,280
'You've slept for two hours,' Maxim told me. 'It's 
quarter past two. We shall be home by three.'

2289
03:16:13,359 --> 03:16:17,679
The early morning was very cold. The sky 
was dark now and there were no stars.

2290
03:16:19,120 --> 03:16:21,599
'What time did you say it was?' I said suddenly.

2291
03:16:22,479 --> 03:16:24,959
'It's twenty past two,' Maxim replied.

2292
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:31,600
'That's strange,' I said. 'The dawn seems to 
be coming up over there, behind those hills.  

2293
03:16:32,399 --> 03:16:34,479
But it can't be, it's too early.'

2294
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:39,201
'It's the wrong direction, too,' 
Maxim said 'you're looking west.'

2295
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:44,160
I went on watching the sky. 
It was still getting lighter.  

2296
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:51,359
A blood-red light was spreading across the 
sky. Maxim began to drive faster, much faster.

2297
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:55,519
'That's not the dawn,' he 
said, 'that's Manderley.'

2298
03:16:57,439 --> 03:17:03,679
We reached the top of the hill. The road to 
Manderley lay before us. There was no moon  

2299
03:17:03,680 --> 03:17:09,201
and the sky above our heads was black. But the 
sky in front of us was full of dreadful light.  

2300
03:17:10,239 --> 03:17:16,559
And the light was red, red like blood. 
The wind blew towards us from the sea.  

2301
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:25,840
The wind smelt of smoke and it was grey with 
ashes. They were the ashes of Manderley.
 
 
 
 
 
 

2302
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:42,000
-  

2303
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:42,500
THE END -
