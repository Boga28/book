1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,200
These things happened to me nearly ten years ago.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,360
I lived in a city, but the city was hot in summer.  

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,920
I wanted to see the country. I wanted to 
walk in the woods and see green trees.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:33,040
I had a little red car and I had a map, 
too. I drove all night out into the country.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:44,160
I was happy in my car. We had a very good 
summer that year. The country was very pretty  

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:54,160
in the early morning. The sun was hot, and the 
sky was blue. I heard the birds in the trees.

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,000
And then my car stopped suddenly.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,320
'What's wrong?' I thought. 'Oh 
dear, I haven't got any petrol.  

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,720
Now I'll have to walk. I'll have to find a 
town and buy some petrol. But where am I?'

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,200
I looked at the map. I wasn't near 
a town. I was lost in the country.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:39,360
And then I saw the girl. She walked down 
the road, with flowers in her hand. She wore  

12
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:48,240
a long dress, and her hair was long, too. It 
was long and black, and it shone in the sun.  

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,480
She was very pretty. I wanted to 
speak to her, so I got out of the car.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,680
'Hello,' I said. 'I'm lost. Where am I?'

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,880
She looked afraid, so I spoke quietly.

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,000
'I haven't got any petrol,' I 
said. 'Where can I find some?'

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Her blue eyes looked at me, and she smiled.

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,240
'She's a very pretty girl!' I thought.

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,040
'I do not know,' she said. 'Come with me 
to the village. Perhaps we can help you.'

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,480
I went with her happily, and we walked a long way.

21
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,160
'There isn't a village on the map,' I 
thought. 'Perhaps it's a very small village.'

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
There was a village, and it was old and pretty.  

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,800
The houses were black and white and 
very small. There were a lot of animals.

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,160
The girl stopped at a house and smiled at me.

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
'Come in, please,' she said.

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,440
I went in. The house was very clean, but it was  

27
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,640
strange, too. There was a fire and 
some food above it. I felt hungry then.

28
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:33,120
'That's strange,' I thought. 'They cook their food 
over a wood fire! Perhaps they have no money.'

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,160
I met her father and mother, and I liked them.  

30
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
They were nice people, but 
their clothes were strange.

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,000
'Sit down,' said the old man. 
'Are you thirsty after your walk?'

32
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,480
He gave me a drink, and I said, 'Thank you.'  

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
But the drink was strange, too. 
It was dark brown and very strong.

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
I didn't understand. But I was happy there.

35
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,400
I asked about petrol, but the 
old man didn't understand.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,960
'Petrol?' he asked. 'What is that?'

37
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,280
'This is strange,' I thought. Then 
I asked, 'Do you walk everywhere?'

38
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,200
The old man smiled. 'Oh, 
no, we use horses,' he said.

39
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,080
'Horses!' I thought. 'Horses are 
very slow. Why don't they have cars?'

40
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
But I didn't say that to the old man.

41
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,080
I felt happy there. I stayed all day, 
and I ate dinner with them that evening.  

42
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,920
Then the girl and I went out into 
the garden. The girl's name was Mary.

43
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,840
'This is nice,' she said. 'We like having 
visitors. We do not see many people here.'

44
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,720
We spoke happily. She was very beautiful.  

45
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,760
But after a time, she began to 
talk quietly, and her face was sad.

46
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,080
'Why are you sad?' I asked her.

47
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,920
'I cannot tell you,' she said.  

48
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,840
'You are only a visitor here. We have to 
say goodbye tonight. You have to go now.'

49
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,920
I didn't understand. I loved her. I 
knew that. And I wanted to help her.  

50
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:57,200
Why did I have to go? But Mary said again in a 
sad voice, 'You have to go. It is dangerous here.'

51
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,840
So I said, 'I'll go to the next town and 
find some petrol. Then I'll come back.'

52
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
She didn't speak.

53
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,480
'I love you, Mary,' I said. 'And I'll 
come back to you. You won't stop me.'

54
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:27,840
She said goodbye to me at the door. Her face was 
very sad, and I was sad, too. I didn't want to go.

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,440
It was midnight. The night was very dark, but I 
walked and walked. I was very tired when I saw  

56
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,760
the lights of a town. I found some petrol, 
and then I asked the name of the village.  

57
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,480
But the man at the garage gave me a strange look.

58
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
'What village?' he asked.

59
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,840
I told him about the village. I told him about the 
old houses and the people with strange clothes.

60
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,840
Again he gave me a strange look. He thought, 
and then he said, 'There was a village there,  

61
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,480
but it isn't there now. There are 
stories about it - strange stories.'

62
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,280
'What do people say about it?' I asked.

63
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,920
He didn't want to tell me, but 
then he said, 'There was a big  

64
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,640
fire in the village. Everybody died. There 
aren't any people or houses there now.'

65
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
'How did it happen?' I asked. 'And why?'

66
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,240
'Oliver Cromwell killed them,' he said.  

67
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,200
'He was angry with the villagers because 
they helped the king in the war.'

68
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,760
I couldn't speak.

69
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,280
'This isn't right,' I thought. 
'That war happened 350 years ago!'

70
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,000
Then I remembered the strange clothes, 
the long hair, the food over the fire,  

71
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,480
and the old houses. And I 
remembered, too, about the horses.

72
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,560
'But I don't understand,' I cried. 
'I saw the people and the village.  

73
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
I spoke to some people there!'

74
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,320
The man looked quickly at me, and then he spoke.

75
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,640
'There's an interesting story about the 
village. For one day every ten years,  

76
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:50,080
it lives again - but only for one day. Then it 
goes away again for another ten years. On that  

77
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:58,160
one day, you can find the village. But you have 
to leave before morning, or you will never leave.'

78
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:10,000
'Can this be right?' I thought. Perhaps it 
was. Mary said, 'You have to go.' She loved me,  

79
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:21,840
but she said, 'We have to say goodbye.' She was 
afraid for me. 'Now I understand,' I thought.

80
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,760
I went back to the village, but it wasn't there. 
I looked again and again, but I couldn't find it.  

81
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,280
I saw only flowers and trees. I heard 
only the sound of the birds and the wind.  

82
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,520
I was very sad. I sat down 
on the ground and cried.

83
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,680
I will never forget that day. I remember 
Mary, and I will always love her.

84
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Now, I only have to wait two months. The 
village will conic back again. On the right day,  

85
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,760
I will go back. I will find her again, 
my love with the long, black hair.  

86
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:24,480
And this time, I will not leave before 
morning. I will stay with her.
 
 
 
 

87
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,065
- THE END -
