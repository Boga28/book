00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,760
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,920
Let's Do It!

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:32,240
Jack Griggs stands on his boat. The wind is 
strong and his boat moves quickly over the sea.  

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,920
A big, white bird goes past and 
makes a noise. 'Keyaaaa', it cries.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,440
Jack smiles and says: 'Hello, 
bird. How are you, today?'

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,280
Jack's friends laugh and 
give some fish to the bird.

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:09,280
'Ah,' says Jack. 'Hungry, I see.' Jack's friends 
are Max and Sasha, and his wife's name is Tonya.

8
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,560
'I am hungry, too,' says Jack. 'Sandwiches 
and drinks everybody? Tonya. Can you steer?'

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Half an hour later they are eating. 
'What are we going to do now?' asks Jack.

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,840
'Oh, I am going to read my book. 
Then I'm going to sleep,' says Tonya.

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,440
'No - what about tomorrow...? 
Next month...? Next year?'  

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,320
Jack looks at everyone. 'We have lots 
of money from our old business, but...'

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,720
'We can start another business,' says Max.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
'A sailing business?' says Sasha.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,480
'I don't want to work any more,' 
says Tonya. 'We don't need to work.'

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,800
'OK, listen to me,' says Jack. 'I am 
thinking about sailing around the world.'

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,240
Max, Tonya and Sasha look at Jack.

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,640
'What? From here to Australia?' says Tonya.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:45,920
'Of course,' says Jack. He is getting very 
excited now. 'Max, what do you think?'

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
'I think we must talk about it,' says Max.

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:06,000
They talk for hours. It is night when Max, Sasha 
and Tonya say excitedly: 'OK. Let's do it!'

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,680
They have to do a lot before they leave.  

23
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,680
Jack talks to a man who knows about sailing around 
the world. He tells Jack that it is hard work.

24
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
'Does the sea frighten you? 
Your boat is very small.  

25
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Do you know your friends well? Are 
they good at sailing?' he asks.

26
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,800
'We know each other well. They are the 
best people in the world,' says Jack.

27
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:54,880
The four friends look at lots of maps. Sasha 
wants to see a whale. Max wants to see Africa.

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
'I want to sit in the sun and 
catch fish to eat,' laughs Tonya.

29
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,840
It is exciting for all of them. 
And at first everything is easy.

30
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,240
The big day arrives - they are leaving. Some 
of their friends and family come to watch.  

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Their friends stand by the water and say goodbye.

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
'Good luck,' one of them says.

33
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
'Don't forget us!' says Sasha's sister.

34
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,840
'Write to me every day,' says Tonya's 
friend. 'Give the letters to a bird.'

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,440
Sasha begins to cry. 'What are we 
doing? Do I really want to go?'  

36
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:03,040
she thinks. Max takes her hand. All of them 
are quiet, excited, and a little unhappy.

37
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
'Bye,' says Jack quietly.
 
 
 

38
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,280
CHAPTER TWO

39
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
Sailing South

40
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,240
The wind is strong and the 
boat moves faster and faster.  

41
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,280
Jack, Max, Sasha and Tonya are 
happy at sea. There is a lot to do  

42
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:53,360
on the boat. The wind is behind them and soon 
they cannot see England. They are not unhappy now.

43
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:06,080
They are sailing south. In France they 
stop at L'Orient and Biarritz. In Spain,  

44
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:20,080
they visit La Coruna, and in Portugal they stop 
in Lisbon. The sun gets hotter and they feel good.

45
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,560
Sasha catches a big fish and they eat it for tea.

46
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,840
Soon, they are sailing past Africa. 
Here, everything is different.  

47
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:48,000
They stop in Gambia and people look at them. 
Small children bring beads and shells and cloth.  

48
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,240
Tonya buys a green hat. There is a lot 
of colour and noise and excitement.

49
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:08,720
They sail for weeks and weeks past Africa. They 
stop at many small towns and villages by the sea.

50
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,680
'Africa is so interesting, so big,' 
says Sasha. 'It goes on and on.  

51
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,040
I look at it on the map, but...'

52
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,480
'This is why we are here,' says 
Jack. 'Talking to different people,  

53
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:45,600
seeing different things. The boat, the sea, 
the wind. Nothing is better than this, is it?'

54
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Some days later they see a big 
fishing boat. It is moving very fast.

55
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:08,240
'Hello!' they shout at the boat. The 
men on the boat look at them angrily.  

56
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,040
Max looks carefully at the 
boat through his binoculars.

57
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,640
'There is something wrong with their fishing 
net,' he says. Max moves the binoculars  

58
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,040
and sees something in the sea. 
'I can see some net over there.'  

59
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:39,840
He points to their left. 'Why are 
they leaving it? Let's have a look.'

60
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:51,760
They get nearer to the net and Tonya takes 
the binoculars. 'What in the world...' says  

61
00:08:51,760 --> 00:09:02,400
Tonya. 'What's that? There is something 
in the net. It's alive, but what is it?'

62
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:17,200
Very slowly they move nearer to the net. The thing 
in the net is big and it is making a lot of noise.

63
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:32,080
'I can see it now,' says Tonya. 'It's an 
orca - a killer whale - and it's hurt.  

64
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,840
There is blood in the water. What 
can we do? How can we help it?'

65
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:51,840
'I can see it too. It is a baby 
but we must be careful,' says Max.

66
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,960
Jack is in the water. He is carrying  

67
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:08,160
a long paddle. 'I am going to help it. 
I can get the net off its fin,' he says.

68
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:21,360
'Where's its mother?' asks Sasha. She looks 
at the sea. 'I can't see any other whales,  

69
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,720
but they are near here, I 
think. Be careful, Jack.'

70
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:39,920
Jack gets the net off the baby killer whale. 
There is a big cut on its fin, but it swims away.  

71
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,080
Suddenly there are other 
killer whales near the boat.

72
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,160
'Jack!' Tonya shouts. 'Get in quickly.'

73
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,400
Jack swims to the boat as fast as a fish.

74
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:13,840
'That baby killer whale... I am 
going to call it Lucky,' he says.
 
 
 

75
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,080
CHAPTER THREE

76
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,080
The Big Wave

77
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:35,200
It begins to rain as they move away 
from the killer whales. Suddenly  

78
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,840
it is raining very hard and there 
is a lot of wind. The sky is black.

79
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:57,200
Jack says: 'This is bad. We must get away from 
the wind. I can see a town over there. Let's go.'

80
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:07,040
'I'm frightened,' says Tonya. It is 
difficult to hear her because of the wind.

81
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,640
'We're all frightened,' says 
Jack. 'But everything is OK.'

82
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,840
The town gets nearer but the 
waves get bigger and bigger.  

83
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:32,720
Suddenly a very big wave hits the 
boat. There is water everywhere.

84
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,760
'Is everyone OK,' shouts Jack. 'Max?'

85
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
'Yes,' says Max.

86
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,800
'Sasha?'

87
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,840
'My arm hurts but I'm OK,' says Sasha.

88
00:12:52,640 --> 00:13:00,880
'Tonya...? Tonya...? Where's Tonya?' shouts Jack.

89
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,280
'She's not in the boat,' says Sasha. 
'She's in the water. But where?'

90
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,000
They look in the cold, dark water for hours.

91
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:25,120
'Tonya! Say something, Tonya. 
Where are you?' shouts Max.

92
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:36,000
The wind gets stronger and the boat is full 
of water. Another big wave hits the boat.  

93
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,240
Sasha's arm hurts a lot now.

94
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:53,440
'Jack, we must stop. Do you want us all to 
die?' says Max. He puts his arm around Jack.  

95
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:05,440
'We can't do any more. Tonya is wearing 
a lifejacket and she can swim very well.  

96
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
Let's sail to the town.'

97
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:21,040
Jack puts his head in his hands. 'This 
can't happen. It can't!' he says.

98
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,840
Max begins to steer the boat. 
But the wind is too strong.  

99
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:41,280
Some time later the boat hits a beach. The 
three friends get out. They are very tired.

100
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:52,240
They stop there. Max and Sasha sleep on 
the beach, but Jack sits near the water.  

101
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,840
He looks at the sea, thinking about Tonya.
 
 
 

102
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
CHAPTER FOUR

103
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,960
Tonya

104
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,840
Tonya is five hundred metres away 
out in the sea. She begins to swim,  

105
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,560
but the waves are too big 
and the water is too cold.  

106
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,320
She finds some wood and puts her arms around it.

107
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,080
Tonya is thinking: 'I must be 
strong. I am not going to die.  

108
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,440
I want to see the sun again. 
Jack is going to find me.'

109
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:10,240
Tonya sees a boat far away. She calls 
to it. 'Help! Help me! I'm over here!'  

110
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,480
She moves her arms and shouts, but nobody hears 
her. The wind moves her away from the boat.

111
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:34,080
'Oh, Jack. I'm sorry,' she says. 
Her head goes down on to the wood.  

112
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,880
In the arms of the sea, she sleeps.

113
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:51,360
Suddenly Tonya is not sleeping. There 
is no wind and she can see the sun.  

114
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:01,440
She looks everywhere. There is a beach in 
front of her - but she cannot swim to it.

115
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,960
'I am too cold and too tired,' she 
thinks. 'I must see a boat soon.'

116
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:20,640
She looks at the sea. There are no 
boats, no people, but some birds.

117
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,720
'Can the birds help me?' she thinks sleepily.

118
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:38,240
Tonya listens to the sea. She likes the 
noise. Then she hears something different.

119
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,840
'Is it a baby crying?' she thinks and looks up.

120
00:17:47,280 --> 00:18:00,880
Ten metres in front of her is a big fin... a 
very big fin. Under the fin is a killer whale.  

121
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:14,320
The whale is making the noise. But it 
is not a baby - it is five metres long.  

122
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,760
Behind it is another whale. 
And another. And another.

123
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,560
'Killer whales eat people. I 
am going to die,' thinks Tonya.

124
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:41,840
The killer whales come nearer and 
nearer. Tonya can't feel her legs.  

125
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:55,840
'It's OK, they are cold. That's all,' she thinks. 
She starts to swim away from the big fins.

126
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,160
'Help me!' she shouts. 'Help, help, help!'

127
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:18,320
The killer whales are all around her. She 
closes her eyes and waits. But she does not die.

128
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:28,000
The biggest killer whale is under 
her. Suddenly she is on his back.

129
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:38,320
'What is happening? Perhaps they 
are not hungry.' Tonya thinks.

130
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:46,480
The killer whale moves slowly to the 
shore. He is taking Tonya to the beach.

131
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,880
Tonya puts her hands on the fin in front of her.

132
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,800
'This is a very big fish - too 
big for my tea!' she thinks.  

133
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:19,840
She smiles and puts her head on his big 
back. Soon, she is sleeping again.
 
 
 

134
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,520
CHAPTER FIVE

135
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,080
'Tonya? Is That You?'

136
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:45,040
Jack sits on the beach. The sun is in 
the sky. Behind him, Max and Sasha sleep.

137
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:56,000
'I must do something,' he thinks. 'I can't 
take my boat but I must look for Tonya.'

138
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,400
He begins to walk along the 
beach. 'There is a town near here.  

139
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,480
I can get a new boat, then I can look for Tonya.'

140
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:22,560
Just then Jack sees something on the 
beach. He walks nearer. It is a woman.

141
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,000
Jack runs to the woman on the beach.

142
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,480
'Tonya?' he shouts. 'Tonya! Is that you?'

143
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
Tonya moves her head slowly.

144
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,800
'Jack! Oh, Jack. You're OK!'

145
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:59,600
Jack puts his arms around Tonya. He kisses her 
face and cries. He can't speak - he is too happy.

146
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,320
Tonya says: 'What about Max 
and Sasha? Are they OK, too?'

147
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,360
'Everyone is OK,' answers Jack.

148
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,640
They sit on the beach and look at the sea.

149
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,840
Jack says: 'We are very, very lucky.'

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,920
Tonya sits up and sees a small fin 
in the water. It has a cut on it.  

151
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:48,160
The fin waves slowly and moves out to 
sea. It is waving goodbye, thinks Tonya.

152
00:22:49,760 --> 00:23:07,840
'Lucky. Yes, Lucky,' she 
says quietly to Jack.

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,184
- THE END -
