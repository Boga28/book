00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:03,639
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,399
Ali Baba was a woodcutter.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,239
He was from Persia, in the Middle East.

4
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:27,119
One day he was at work in the woods when he saw forty men on forty black horses.

5
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,819
They stopped near a huge rock.

6
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,099
They had forty big, heavy, brown sacks on their backs.

7
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:42,419
Ali Baba watched the men as they got off their horses.

8
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:54,000
A tall man walked to the rock and said "Open Sesame." Ali Baba looked and looked again...

9
00:00:55,919 --> 00:01:00,879
Something amazing happened... the rock opened!

10
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,500
Behind the rock was a cave.

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,699
The forty men went into the cave with their sacks.

12
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:16,720
Later, when the men came out of the cave, they didn't have their sacks.

13
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,860
"Close Sesame," said the tall man, and the rock closed!

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,360
The forty men got on their horses and went away.

15
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,360
Ali Baba went to the rock.

16
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,019
"Open Sesame," he said.

17
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:45,799
The rock opened... and inside the cave there were hundreds of sacks and wooden boxes.

18
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:52,599
Ali Baba opened a sack and... it was full of diamonds!

19
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,119
He opened another sack and... it was full of gold coins!

20
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,999
He opened a box and... it was full of silver!

21
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,939
He opened another box and... it was full of beautiful jewels!

22
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,619
"These forty men are thieves," thought Ali.

23
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:24,679
"I'm going to take some of these coins home for my wife!"

24
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:31,519
He put some gold coins into his bag and went out of the cave.

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,779
"Close Sesame," he said.

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,999
The rock closed and he went home.

27
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,459
Ali Baba's wife, Nasreen, was in the kitchen.

28
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,239
Ali Baba told her about the forty thieves and the treasure in the cave.

29
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:57,399
"This is wonderful news," said Nasreen.

30
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:03,879
"Can we take more money and buy a new house and new clothes?"

31
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,219
"Yes, but we mustn't tell anyone," said Ali.

32
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,499
"The forty thieves are very dangerous men."

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,619
Ali's brother, Cassim, was outside the kitchen.

34
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,739
He opened the door.

35
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,279
"Tell me where the cave is!" he shouted.

36
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,919
"You must tell me or I'm going to go and look for it myself!"

37
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,459
"No! Don't do that!" said Ali.

38
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:53,119
"Go into the woods. There's a huge rock near the big baobab tree. The rock opens when you say "Open Sesame" and closes when you say "Close Sesame".

39
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:05,838
Cassim went to the rock. "Open Sesame," he said. He went into the cave and the rock closed.

40
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:15,718
"This is amazing," thought Cassim. "Gold, silver... beautiful jewels!"

41
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:23,778
He had three big sacks with him and filled them with gold and silver and jewels.

42
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:32,738
He stood in front of the rock and said "Open Wheat", but the rock didn't open!

43
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:39,698
He said "Open Corn," but the rock didn't open!

44
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,938
"Oh! What is the right word?" he thought.

45
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,919
Cassim was angry.

46
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,598
He couldn't remember the word!

47
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:55,818
He sat down to think, but suddenly he heard horses.

48
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:59,658
The forty thieves were outside the cave!

49
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:01,638
Look!

50
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,758
A horse!

51
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,198
Someone's in our cave!

52
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:12,158
"He can't have our treasure! He must die!" said the tall man.

53
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:19,459
The next morning Cassim's wife, Zhila, went to Ali Baba.

54
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:27,378
"Cassim didn't come home last night! Do you know where he is?" she asked.

55
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:31,058
Ali told Zhila about the cave.

56
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:39,639
"Please go to the cave! The thieves are dangerous men. They'll kill him!" she said.

57
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:42,518
Ali went to the rock.

58
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:47,538
It was closed but he heard a noise.

59
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,618
"Cassim, are you there?" he said.

60
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:56,758
"Yes, yes... I'm here. Help me! I'm hurt."

61
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,577
"Open Sesame," said Ali Baba and the rock opened.

62
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,478
Cassim was on the floor... he couldn't walk!

63
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:14,157
"The thieves said I must die but I didn't die!" he said.

64
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:23,537
"You didn't die but you're hurt! Let's go home now and the doctor can come to the house later tonight."

65
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:29,577
The next afternoon the thieves went back to the cave.

66
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:34,317
"He isn't here!" said the tall man.

67
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:41,818
"We must find him. He was hurt! We must find the doctor who helped him!"

68
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,337
The tall man found the doctor's house.

69
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:48,117
He was angry.

70
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:55,478
"Where's the man you helped yesterday? Where's his house?" he asked.

71
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,197
"I don't know," said the doctor.

72
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:06,437
"It was dark and I couldn't see the road or the houses."

73
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:15,437
"Then take me to the house tonight when it's dark," said the tall man.

74
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:23,837
The, doctor took the tall man to Ali's house later that night and the tall man painted a white cross on the door.

75
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:30,358
"Now I know where Cassim and his family live," he thought.

76
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:36,577
"They must all die! And I've got a plan!"

77
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:44,617
The tall man went to the market and bought thirty-nine big oil pots.

78
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:51,998
"Put the pots on your horses then hide inside them" he told the thieves.

79
00:07:53,117 --> 00:08:01,996
"I'm going to Ali Baba's house and you'll be in the pots. We'll kill them all tonight when they are asleep!"

80
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,077
That evening he went to Ali Baba's house.

81
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:22,457
"Good evening. I'm an oil merchant from India and I'm very tired," he said "Have you got a room where I can sleep and a place for my horses?"

82
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:28,416
"Of course! Welcome to my home," said Ali.

83
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,756
Zhila was in the kitchen with Nasreen.

84
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:39,116
"That man isn't Indian; he's Persian," said Zhila.

85
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:45,216
"I don't like him. Let's go and look at the pots on his horses."

86
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:50,036
They went out of the house into the garden.

87
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:56,256
There were lots of stars in the sky and everything was very quiet.

88
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:06,376
Suddenly they heard a man's voice: "When are we going to kill Cassim and AliBaba and their wives?"

89
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,576
"When they're asleep," said another voice.

90
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,876
The women looked at the pots on the horses.

91
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:23,777
Thirty-nine pots in their garden... thirty-nine men in the pots, and one man in the house...

92
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,256
The Forty Thieves!

93
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,256
"Quickly!" said Zhila.

94
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:30,436
"Open the gate."

95
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:33,637
Nasreen opened the gate.

96
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:41,816
"Shoo, shoo, go away! Shoo, shoo, go away!" they shouted at the horses.

97
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,216
The horses ran out of the garden.

98
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:49,756
They ran and they ran and they ran.

99
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:54,276
They ran into the desert and never came back.

100
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:59,795
The tall man went into the garden when everyone was sleeping.

101
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,755
His horses weren't there!

102
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,175
His pots weren't there!

103
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,796
His men weren't there!

104
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:16,915
He ran out of the garden, he ran into the desert, but he couldn't see his horses or his men.

105
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:23,275
He ran and he ran and he ran and he never came back.

106
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:30,875
In the morning Cassim and Ali Baba woke up early and went into the garden.

107
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,295
"This is very strange," said Ali.

108
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:40,576
The oil merchant isn't here, and his horses aren't here!

109
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:42,815
Where are they?"

110
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:48,256
"You men are very silly," said Nasreen.

111
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:52,575
"Yes, very silly," said Zhila.

112
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:58,615
"The oil merchant from India wasn't an oil merchant from India."

113
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,635
"No," said Nasreen.

114
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:04,895
"He was the leader of the forty thieves!"

115
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:10,415
"Where are the forty thieves now?" said Cassim.

116
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:18,056
"They ran into the desert, and let's hope they'll never come back!" said Zhila.

117
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:25,215
"Tomorrow you can go and get the treasure and we'll give some to everyone in the village!"

118
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:33,335
The next day Cassim and Ali Baba went back to the rock with ten grey donkeys.

119
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:37,295
"Open Wheat," said Cassim.

120
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:47,255
"No, silly! Don't you remember? It's not Wheat. It's Sesame!" said Ali Baba.

121
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:56,115
"Of course, the word is "Sesame". Open Sesame," said Cassim.

122
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:03,915
The rock opened and they put all the wooden boxes and sacks of treasure on the donkeys.

123
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:09,755
Then they went back to the village and gave the treasure to the poor villagers.

124
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:14,654
"Thank you, Nasreen and Zhila" said the villagers.

125
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:17,875
"You're very clever women!"
