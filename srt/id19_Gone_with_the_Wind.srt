CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:06,180
News of a Wedding

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,339
Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men
did not realize this when caught by her charm

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:21,250
as the Tarleton twins were. Her eyes were
green, and her skin was that soft white skin

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:27,740
which Southern women valued so highly, and
covered so carefully from the hot Georgia

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,430
sun with hats and gloves.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:40,710
On that bright April afternoon of 1861, sixteen-year-old
Scarlett sat in the cool shadows of the house

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:49,320
at Tara, her father's plantation. Stuart and
Brent Tarleton sat each side of her. They

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,179
were friendly young men with deep red-brown
hair, and were clever in the things that mattered

10
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:04,269
in north Georgia at that time - growing good
cotton, riding well, shooting straight and

11
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,460
behaving like a gentleman.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:15,250
'Don't you two care about being sent home
from the University of Georgia for bad behaviour?'

13
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,540
Scarlett was saying.

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,840
'The war will start soon,' said Brent. 'You
didn't think we'd stay in university with

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,070
a war going on, did you?'

16
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:32,350
'There isn't going to be a war,' said Scarlett,
looking bored. 'Ashley Wilkes and his father

17
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:38,860
told Pa just last week that our men in Washington
will come to an agreement with Mr Lincoln

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,820
about the Confederacy. Anyway, the Yankees
are too frightened of us to fight. And if

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,921
you say "war" once more, I'll go inside the
house and shut the door!'

20
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:58,740
They looked across the red earth of Gerald
O'Hara's land, which stretched away as far

21
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,780
as the eye could see. The white house was
like an island, sitting in a wild red sea,

22
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,730
the earth blood-coloured after the rains of
recent weeks.

23
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,590
'Scarlett, you'll promise to dance with us
at the party at Twelve Oaks tomorrow, won't

24
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,800
you?' said Brent.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,209
'If you do, we'll tell you a secret,' said
Stuart.

26
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,680
'What secret?' asked Scarlett. 'Who told you?'

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,329
'Miss Pittypat Hamilton, Ashley Wilkes' cousin
who lives in Atlanta. Charles and Melanie

28
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,680
Hamilton's aunt,' said Stuart.

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,739
'She said that we'll hear news of a wedding
tomorrow night, at the party,' said Brent.

30
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:58,140
'Oh, I know that!' said Scarlett, disappointed.
'It's about Charlie Hamilton and Honey Wilkes.

31
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,390
Everyone knows they'll get married some day.'

32
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:12,599
'No, it's about Ashley,' said Stuart. 'He's
going to marry Charlie's sister, Miss Melanie!'

33
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,439
Scarlett's face did not change but her lips
went white - like a person who is in the first

34
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,340
moments of shock.

35
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:28,029
'They weren't going to marry until next year,'
said Stuart, 'but with all the talk of war,

36
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:36,299
both families think it will be better if they're
married soon.' He smiled. 'Now, Scarlett,

37
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,180
you must promise to eat supper with us at
the party.'

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,790
'Of course I will,' said Scarlett automatically.

39
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,019
'And give us plenty of dances?'

40
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,849
'Yes.' She spoke as if in a dream.

41
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,480
'And sit with us at lunch, too?' said Brent.

42
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,599
'What?' said Scarlett. 'Oh, yes, of course.'

43
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:11,590
The twins were unable to believe their good
luck. They talked on about the dance, and

44
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:19,280
Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. They laughed
and joked, and waited for Scarlett to invite

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:27,479
them to supper; and it was some time before
they realized she was not listening to them.

46
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,479
***

47
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,850
Scarlett watched the twins ride away.

48
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:41,250
Ashley was going to marry Melanie Hamilton!
Oh, it couldn't be true! It was all a mistake.

49
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,639
Ashley was in love with her, not Melanie!

50
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,009
Mammy came out of the house. She was a big
old negro who loved Ellen O'Hara and her family.

51
00:04:54,009 --> 00:05:02,360
'Are the gentlemen gone?' she asked. 'Why
didn't you ask them to stay to supper?'

52
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:10,060
'I didn't want to listen to them talking to
Pa about the war all through supper,' said

53
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,280
Scarlett.

54
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,570
'You just ain't polite, Miss Scarlett,' said
Mammy. 'Now come into the house before you

55
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,050
get cold.'

56
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:27,979
'I want to watch the sun go down,' said Scarlett.
'I'll sit here until Pa comes home. Just fetch

57
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,600
me a light coat, Mammy.'

58
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,080
Mammy went back into the house and Scarlett
made a sudden decision. 'I'll go and meet

59
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,069
Pa,' she thought. 'He'll be coming back from
Twelve Oaks soon, and he'll know about Ashley.'

60
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:56,360
As a child, Scarlett had not given Ashley
Wilkes a single thought. But two years ago,

61
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,870
he had arrived home after touring Europe - riding
up to Tara with the sun so bright on his fair

62
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:14,180
hair that it shone like silver. 'You've grown
up, Scarlett,' he had said, kissing her hand.

63
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,669
And from that moment on, she wanted him as
simply as she wanted food to eat, and horses

64
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,580
to ride, and a soft bed to sleep in.

65
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:34,110
For two years, he took her to dances and suppers,
and a week did not go past without Ashley

66
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,750
calling at Tara. It was true he never spoke
to her of love, and his clear grey eyes never

67
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:48,729
burned with that hot light Scarlett knew so
well in other men. But she was sure that he

68
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:58,590
loved her. She saw him looking at her sometimes,
in that sad, strange way of his.

69
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,870
Scarlett heard the sound of Gerald O'Hara's
horse and saw him coming across the fields

70
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:12,229
at full speed. Gerald was sixty years old,
a small man with silver-white hair and hard

71
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:17,469
little blue eyes. He was surprised to see
her.

72
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:21,990
'How is everyone at Twelve Oaks?' she asked
him.

73
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,370
'They're all talking about the war,' he said,
'and-'

74
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,060
'Did they speak about the party?' Scarlett
asked quickly.

75
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:40,949
'Yes, I think they did,' said Gerald. 'Miss
Melanie Hamilton and her brother Charles have

76
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,800
come from Atlanta and-'

77
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:52,840
'Oh, so she did come!' Scarlett's heart became
heavy. 'Was Ashley there, too?'

78
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:00,969
'Yes, he was.' Gerald looked closely at his
daughter. 'That's why you came to meet me,

79
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:08,009
isn't it? Why didn't you say so before? Now
what's all this about you and Ashley?'

80
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,530
'There's nothing, Pa,' she said.

81
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,310
'Has he asked to marry you?'

82
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,590
'No,' said Scarlett, quietly.

83
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:26,080
'And he won't,' said Gerald. 'John Wilkes
says that Ashley is to marry Miss Melanie.

84
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,039
They'll tell everyone tomorrow.'

85
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,880
A pain cut across Scarlett's heart and she
found it hard to breathe. Her father watched

86
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,550
her, and looked uncomfortable.

87
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,959
'Have you run after a man who's not in love
with you?'

88
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,700
'No!' said Scarlett.

89
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:54,450
'You're lying!' said Gerald. Then went on
in a kind way, 'There are lots of other young

90
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:01,620
men, Scarlett. I want you to be happy, and
you wouldn't be happy with him.'

91
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,760
'Oh, I would! I would!'

92
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,680
'The Wilkes are different from other people,'
said Gerald. They marry their cousins and

93
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,060
keep their strangeness in the family. Look
how they read books, and go to Boston and

94
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,160
New York to see paintings and hear music.'

95
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,110
'Nobody rides a horse better than Ashley!'
said Scarlett.

96
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:36,760
'Oh, yes, Ashley can ride and drink with the
best of men, but he cares nothing about those

97
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:45,520
things,' said Gerald. 'Now listen, there are
other fine boys to marry, Scarlett. And when

98
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you and-'

99
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:58,560
'I don't want Tara!' cried Scarlett, angrily.
'Plantations don't mean anything when-' She

100
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:06,000
was going to say when you don't have the man
you want, but Gerald's shout stopped her.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,029
'Not mean anything! Land is the only thing
in the world that does mean anything!' he

102
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:20,690
cried. 'It will come to you, Scarlett, this
love of the land. It's in your blood and there's

103
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,750
no denying it.' He held her arm as they walked
towards the house. 'I'll not worry your mother

104
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,880
with this, and nor must you.'

105
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,230
They met Ellen O'Hara at the door. She was
carrying the black bag in which she always

106
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:47,560
kept the medicines she used for the slaves.
Mammy was with her, and did not look pleased.

107
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:56,079
'Mr O'Hara,' Ellen said, 'a baby is dying
at the Slattery house and Mammy and I are

108
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,320
going to see what we can do.'

109
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,670
'The Slatterys!' shouted Gerald. 'Those white
trash?'

110
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:12,649
'She is always nursin' negroes and white trash
who could not look after themselves,' said

111
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,279
Mammy, annoyed.

112
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,160
'Take my place at supper, Scarlett,' said
Ellen, touching her daughter's cheek. She

113
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,019
was a tall woman, with a quiet, gentle voice
and a warm smile that charmed everyone.

114
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:35,709
There was something magical about her mother's
touch, thought Scarlett, and for a moment

115
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,660
forgot all about Ashley.

116
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:48,750
But later an idea came to her. 'Ashley doesn't
know I love him!' she thought. 'He thinks

117
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:56,060
I love Brent or Stuart, and he's marrying
Melanie because he thinks he can't have me!

118
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:05,199
I must tell him, then we can run off to Jonesboro
and get married! By this time tomorrow night,

119
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:12,589
I might be Mrs Ashley Wilkes!'

120
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,290
CHAPTER TWO

121
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,290
Rhett Butler

122
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:24,440
Early the next morning, Gerald told his plantation
manager, Jonas Wilkerson, to pack his things

123
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:32,279
and leave. Jonas, Ellen had discovered, was
the father of Emmie Slattery's dead baby,

124
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:40,009
and now Ellen would not have him working at
Tara. Jonas was a Yankee and hated all Southerners,

125
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,970
and he was angry at losing the best manager's
job in the neighbourhood.

126
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:53,480
Ellen told Gerald that she was not going to
the party at Twelve Oaks. 'I must check Jonas's

127
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,320
figures in the plantation books,' she said.
'Mammy will stay and help me.'

128
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:08,310
So Gerald rode on his horse beside the carriage
that took Scarlett and her two sisters down

129
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,740
the road to Twelve Oaks.

130
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,459
Scarlett thought about her plans to marry
Ashley. 'No one must suspect anything,' she

131
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:27,910
thought, 'so I'll flirt with every man there,
from old Frank Kennedy to shy Charlie Hamilton.

132
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,290
It will be cruel to Ashley, but it will make
him want me more.'

133
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:41,389
'I don't know why you look so happy this morning,'
said her sister, Suellen, looking at Scarlett.

134
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:49,430
'You know Ashley's going to marry Melanie,
Pa said so. And I know you love Ashley!'

135
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:58,690
'Suellen, that's not true!' said Careen, the
youngest of the three. 'It's Brent that Scarlett

136
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,120
cares about.'

137
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,079
The whole family knew that Careen loved Brent
Tarleton. But he never gave her a thought

138
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:16,029
except as Scarlett's baby sister. 'I don't
care about Brent,' said Scarlett, smiling,

139
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:23,280
'and he doesn't care about me. He's waiting
for you to grow up!'

140
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:31,550
Careen went red in the face, 'Oh, Scarlett,
is he really?' she said.

141
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:38,000
They went over the hill, and saw Twelve Oaks.
The house was white and beautiful under the

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,730
blue sky. Lunch was going to be served outside,
and Scarlett saw the Tarleton twins with their

143
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:53,470
two brothers, Boyd and Tom; and Alex and Tony
Fontaine; and the two Calvert boys, Raiford

144
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,650
and Cade.

145
00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:00,050
'Good! Everyone is here!' thought Scarlett.

146
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:07,319
John Wilkes stood on the entrance steps, a
silver-haired man with a quiet charm that

147
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:15,230
was as warm as a summer sun. Next to him was
his daughter, Honey Wilkes. His other daughter,

148
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,339
India, was nowhere to be seen, and Scarlett
guessed that she was in the kitchen giving

149
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,810
final orders to the servants.

150
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:31,230
'Poor India,' thought Scarlett. 'She's been
so busy looking after Twelve Oaks since her

151
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:38,199
mother died that she's had no time to catch
any man except Stuart Tarleton, and it's not

152
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,529
my problem if he thinks I'm prettier than
her.'

153
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:48,910
John Wilkes helped Scarlett from the carriage,
and Frank Kennedy hurried to give a helping

154
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:58,860
hand to Suellen, who went red but looked delighted.
Frank was forty, with a thin red beard. He

155
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,839
was nervous with women and was surprised when
Scarlett, remembering her plan, gave him one

156
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,990
of her best smiles.

157
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,339
Stuart and Brent Tarleton moved towards her,
and Scarlett looked around as she talked and

158
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:22,279
laughed with them. Suddenly, she noticed a
stranger standing alone. He looked at least

159
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:30,199
thirty-five and was tall and strong, with
a black moustache. Scarlett went red as he

160
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:37,940
stared at her with a cool smile. Then he turned
away as someone called, 'Rhett! Rhett Butler!'

161
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:48,990
Rhett Butler? Did she know the name? Scarlett's
thoughts turned to Ashley and she forgot about

162
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,459
the smiling man.

163
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:58,250
'I must go and comb my hair,' she told Stuart
and Brent. 'You boys wait for me, and don't

164
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,290
run off with any other girl!'

165
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:09,059
As she went up the wide stairs, a shy voice
behind her called her name. Scarlett turned

166
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:17,640
and saw Charles Hamilton, a nice-looking boy
with soft brown hair and deep brown eyes.

167
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:27,429
She gave him her biggest smile. 'Why, Charles
Hamilton, you handsome old thing! I'm sure

168
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:35,000
you came all the way from Atlanta just to
break my poor heart!'

169
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,730
Charles almost fainted. This was the way girls
talked to other boys, not to him!

170
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,610
'Now you wait here until I come back,' said
Scarlett. 'And don't talk to those other girls

171
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,830
or I'll be very jealous!'

172
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,990
'I - I won't,' he said.

173
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,750
Scarlett saw Rhett Butler, a few feet away.
He was smiling again, and had a strange look

174
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:13,919
in his eye as he stared at her. Scarlett went
red again and hurried on up the stairs.

175
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,700
Cathleen Calvert was in the bedroom.

176
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,570
'Cathleen,' said Scarlett, 'who is that nasty
man Butler?'

177
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:31,190
'My dear, don't you know?' whispered Cathleen,
excitedly. 'He's from Charleston, but his

178
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,220
family won't speak to him!'

179
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,159
'Really?' said Scarlett. 'Why?'

180
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:45,190
'He took a girl out riding in a carriage one
afternoon and they stayed out nearly all night!

181
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:51,630
When they finally arrived home, he said that
the horse ran away and that they got lost

182
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,240
in the forest. And guess what?'

183
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,640
'Tell me,' said Scarlett, hoping for the worst.

184
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,050
'He refused to marry her the next day!'

185
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,750
'Oh,' said Scarlett, disappointed.

186
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:14,700
'He said that he did nothing to her, but her
brother invited him to fight - and Mr Butler

187
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,970
shot him! Well, after that, Mr Butler had
to leave Charleston.'

188
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,320
'Did she have a baby?' whispered Scarlett.

189
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,730
'No,' said Cathleen, 'but no one will ever
marry her now.'

190
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:38,789
'I wish Ashley would stay out all night with
me,' thought Scarlett. 'He's too much of a

191
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:45,850
gentleman not to marry me afterwards.'

192
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,530
CHAPTER THREE

193
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,809
Changes

194
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:57,110
Scarlett sat under a large tree, with her
lunch on a plate in front of her. But although

195
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:03,700
there were seven handsome young men sitting
around her, Ashley was not one of them and

196
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:12,409
she was not happy. He was sitting on the grass
with Melanie Hamilton, talking quietly and

197
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:21,470
smiling the slow, lazy smile that Scarlett
loved. Melanie had dark hair and a heart-shaped

198
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:28,840
face. She was small, but seemed older than
her seventeen years.

199
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,770
Scarlett saw Rhett Butler talking to John
Wilkes. He looked at her and laughed, and

200
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:43,470
she had the feeling that this nasty man knew
her true feelings about Ashley, and was amused.

201
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:50,600
It was two o'clock and the sun was warm. Scarlett
was just wondering if India would suggest

202
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,390
that the ladies went into the house, when
she heard Gerald arguing with John Wilkes.

203
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:04,700
'Hope for peace with the Yankees?' Gerald
was shouting. 'No, the South must show that

204
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,880
it's strong and ready for a fight!'

205
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,059
Other men joined in the discussion. 'Of course
we'll fight!'

206
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,770
'Yankee thieves!'

207
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:23,120
'One Southerner can fight twenty Yankees!'
Charles Hamilton found himself alone with

208
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:35,680
Scarlett as the others moved away. 'Miss O'Hara,'
he said, 'if I go to fight, will you be sorry?'

209
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,410
Scarlett thought men were stupid to think
women were interested in these things, but

210
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:48,190
she answered, 'I'll cry into my pillow every
night,' not meaning a word of it.

211
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:58,580
'Miss O'Hara, I must tell you something,'
said Charles, suddenly feeling brave. 'I - I

212
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:07,840
love you! I want to marry you!' Scarlett wanted
to tell Charles he looked silly, but said

213
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,480
automatically, 'This is so sudden. I don't
know what to say.'

214
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,809
'I'll wait for ever!' cried Charles.

215
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:26,050
Scarlett noticed that Ashley was now with
the group of men. 'If Georgia fights, I'll

216
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:33,030
go with her,' Ashley was saying. 'But most
of the sadness in the world was caused by

217
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:39,320
wars, and when they were over, no one knew
what they were about.'

218
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:47,540
More arguing burst out after this until Rhett
Butler spoke. 'Gentlemen,' he said, 'can I

219
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:54,980
say a word? There's not one gun factory in
the South, and not a wool or cotton factory

220
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,400
either. We haven't a single war-ship, and
the Yankees could quickly stop us selling

221
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:10,380
our cotton abroad with a blockade. They have
all the things we haven't got, gentlemen.

222
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:18,460
All we have is cotton and slaves - and brave
talk!'

223
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:25,070
Everyone was shocked, but Scarlett could not
help feeling he was right. She had never seen

224
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:33,740
a factory, and did not know anyone who had.
'But he's no gentleman to say these things

225
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,040
at a party, where everyone is having a good
time,' she thought.

226
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
***

227
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,110
It was late afternoon, and the ladies were
resting in the six great bedrooms at Twelve

228
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:52,730
Oaks, to be ready for the dance that evening.
They had their dresses off, and most were

229
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,480
asleep.

230
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,500
Scarlett checked that Melanie was lying down
next to Honey Wilkes before she quietly left

231
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,960
the room and went down the stairs. From a
window, she saw Ashley drinking and talking

232
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,140
with a group of men on the step outside. She
walked silently across to the library. 'I'll

233
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:26,460
wait in here until he comes into the house,'
she thought, 'and then I'll call to him.'

234
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:33,470
The library was half-dark with the curtains
closed to keep out the sun. Across the room

235
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:41,820
was a sofa with its high back towards her,
and around the walls were hundreds of books.

236
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:49,529
Scarlett left the door open and tried to remember
what she was going to say to Ashley. 'Perhaps

237
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:57,399
it will help if I pray,' she thought, and
closed her eyes.

238
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:03,830
'Scarlett!' It was Ashley's voice. She opened
her eyes and saw him looking at her from the

239
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:10,940
doorway. 'Are you hiding from Charles or the
Tarletons?' he said.

240
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,380
She pulled him into the room.

241
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,419
'What is it?' he said. 'Have you got a secret
to tell me?'

242
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:25,419
'Yes - a secret,' she said. 'I love you!'

243
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:32,510
He was silent, and there was a worried and
confused look in his eyes. Then he made himself

244
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:40,100
smile and said lightly, 'You have every other
man's heart here today, Scarlett, isn't that

245
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:47,330
enough? Do you want mine, too? Well, you've
always had it.'

246
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:55,549
'He doesn't believe me!' she thought. 'He
thinks I'm just flirting with him!' Scarlett

247
00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:05,490
looked into his eyes. 'Ashley! Tell me you
love me, my dear!' she cried.

248
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:10,640
He put his hand across her lips. 'Don't say
these things.'

249
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:21,620
'But I love you,' she cried, 'and I know you
love me. Ashley, you do care, don't you?'

250
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,980
'Yes,' he said quietly. 'I care.'

251
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,460
'And you do want to marry me?' she said.

252
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:37,240
'I'm going to marry Melanie,' he replied.
He took her hands in his. 'How can I make

253
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,200
you understand, Scarlett? Love just isn't
enough when two people are as different as

254
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,070
we are.'

255
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,430
'But you said you cared for me,' said Scarlett.

256
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,399
'I was wrong to say it.'

257
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:02,530
She began to get angry. 'You're afraid to
marry me!' she said, her voice getting louder.

258
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:09,840
'You'll marry that stupid little fool who
can only say "No" and "Yes"!'

259
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,460
Ashley's face went white. 'Stop!' he said.

260
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:22,620
She pulled away from him. 'I'll hate you until
I die!' she shouted, and she hit him hard

261
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,399
across the face.

262
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:32,660
He said nothing, but lifted her hand to his
lips and kissed it. Then he was gone, and

263
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,059
the memory of the sad and hopeless look on
his face would stay with her until the day

264
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:42,019
she died.

265
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:50,789
Scarlett began to shake. 'Now he'll hate me,'
she thought. 'Every time he looks at me he'll

266
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:59,261
remember me saying all those things.' She
began to feel hot all over. Did other people

267
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:06,179
know how she felt about Ashley? Was everyone
laughing at her?

268
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:11,799
Her hand dropped to a little table next to
her, and her fingers closed around a pretty

269
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:19,010
glass bowl. She picked it up and threw it
wildly across the room. It missed the top

270
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,650
of the sofa but crashed against the wall beyond.

271
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:32,710
'This,' said a voice from the other side of
the sofa, 'is too much!' A man had been lying

272
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,380
on it, but now he stood up.

273
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,630
It was Rhett Butler.

274
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:46,760
Scarlett almost fainted. 'Sir,' she said,
'you are no gentleman to listen to other people's

275
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
conversations!'

276
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:58,490
'And you, Miss, are no lady,' he said. 'But
ladies rarely interest me, and I cannot understand,

277
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:06,640
my dear Miss O'Hara, what a wild and hot-blooded
girl like you can find to like about the handsome

278
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,690
but very boring Mr Wilkes.'

279
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:16,390
'You aren't good enough to clean his boots!'
she shouted.

280
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:25,111
He laughed. 'And you were going to hate him
all your life!' She wanted to kill him, but

281
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:32,609
she walked out of the room and pulled the
heavy door shut behind her with a crash.

282
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:33,609
***

283
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:42,480
A horse came fast towards the house, its rider
low over the animal's back. Excitement was

284
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,769
in every line of the man's face as he jumped
down. The other men crowded round him, and

285
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:56,540
he spoke quickly. Suddenly, Stuart Tarleton
gave a shout.

286
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:03,650
Scarlett saw these things through a window
as she went quietly back up the stairs. 'Somebody's

287
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,090
house must be on fire,' she thought. She went
on to the bedroom and was about to open the

288
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,649
door when she heard voices inside.

289
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:20,390
'Scarlett flirted with every man here today,'
Honey Wilkes was saying. 'She was certainly

290
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,380
going after Charles, and you know Charles
and I are going to be married.'

291
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,149
'Are you really!' whispered other voices excitedly.

292
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:37,799
'Yes, but don't tell anybody yet,' said Honey.
'But there's only one person Scarlett cares

293
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,510
about - and that's Ashley!'

294
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:48,910
'Honey, you know that isn't true,' said Melanie.
'And it's so unkind to say it.'

295
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:55,570
'It is true! Scarlett took Stuart from India,
and today she tried to take Mr Kennedy from

296
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,960
Suellen. And Ashley-'

297
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,690
Scarlett ran back down the stairs. 'I must
get home!' she thought. But when she was on

298
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:13,630
the steps outside, she stopped. She couldn't
go home! She couldn't run away and show them

299
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:19,549
how ashamed she was feeling! It would only
make things worse.

300
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:25,179
She hated them. She hated Ashley. She hated
everyone!

301
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:33,529
'I'll stay and make them sorry,' she thought.
'I will!'

302
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:38,510
She turned towards the house - and saw Charles
Hamilton.

303
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,220
'Do you know what's happened?' he cried.

304
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,420
She said nothing, only stared at him.

305
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:54,789
'Mr Lincoln called for soldiers!' he said.
'Seventy-five thousand of them! Of course,

306
00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:03,000
it will mean fighting, Miss Scarlett, but
don't you worry, it'll be all over in a month.'

307
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,429
Scarlett was only half-listening. 'He has
plenty of money,' she was thinking. 'He lives

308
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:17,880
in Atlanta, and if I marry him quickly it
will show Ashley that I don't care - that

309
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:25,659
I was only flirting with him. And it will
just kill Honey. She'll never get another

310
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:32,760
man, and everyone will laugh at her! And it
will hurt Melanie because she loves Charles

311
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,200
so much.'

312
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,639
'Will you wait for me, Miss Scarlett?' Charles
was saying.

313
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:47,289
Scarlett made a decision. 'I don't want to
wait,' she said.

314
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:55,750
He held her hand, his mouth wide open. Twice
he tried to say something, but the words wouldn't

315
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:07,220
come. At last he said, 'Can - can you possibly
love me?'

316
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:14,470
She said nothing but looked down at the floor,
pretending to be shy. Charles wanted to shout

317
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:22,570
and sing and kiss her, and then to tell everyone
that Scarlett O'Hara loved him!

318
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:29,060
'Will you marry me soon?' he said, not daring
to breathe.

319
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:35,129
'The sooner the better,' she said.

320
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:36,129
***

321
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:43,070
Within two weeks, Ashley was married to Melanie,
and Scarlett was married to Charles. Two months

322
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:47,450
later she was a widow.

323
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:54,750
Charles died from typhoid. He never fought
a battle. He never got close to a Yankee.

324
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:02,120
Soon after, Scarlett discovered that she was
going to have a baby, and she became the mother

325
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:11,500
of Charles son. She called him Wade. She did
not love or want the child, and it did not

326
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,580
seem possible that he was hers.

327
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:23,060
Every time she thought of Ashley, she cried,
and went back to her bed and refused to eat.

328
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:31,110
Ellen tried to help but failed. And then Charles
aunt, Miss Pittypat Hamilton, wrote asking

329
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:38,260
if Scarlett could come to Atlanta for a long
visit. She and Melanie wanted very much to

330
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,080
see Charlie's dear little baby.

331
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:49,680
So Scarlett went to Atlanta with Wade, and
Prissy, her young slave. She did not want

332
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:56,840
to go, but any change was welcome.

333
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,530
CHAPTER FOUR

334
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,220
Atlanta

335
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:08,310
The war was making Atlanta a busy city. Trains
thundered in and out, and the narrow, muddy

336
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:15,340
streets were full of army wagons and ambulances.
Scarlett rode from the railway station in

337
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:22,670
Miss Pittypat's carriage, with 'Uncle Peter',
a tall, thin negro who was Aunt Pitty's old

338
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,050
slave.

339
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:31,020
She saw a tall, handsome woman in a bright
coloured dress, and with hair so red that

340
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,380
it couldn't possibly be the real colour. 'Who
is that, Uncle Peter?' she whispered.

341
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,970
'I don't know,' said Uncle Peter, looking
away quickly.

342
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,310
'Yes, you do. Who is she?'

343
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:56,190
'Belle Watling,' he said after a moment. 'Miss
Pitty ain't going to like you asking questions

344
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,010
about women like that.'

345
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:09,140
Scarlett was suddenly shocked. 'She must be
a bad woman!' she thought, staring. She had

346
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,340
never seen a prostitute before.

347
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:21,020
Miss Pittypat's red-brick house was on Peachtree
Road, and Aunt Pitty was waiting excitedly

348
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:28,360
on the front step. Melanie was with her and
Scarlett saw the loving smile of welcome on

349
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:34,670
the little heart-shaped face - and felt a
rush of dislike.

350
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:40,800
This jealous dislike grew as the days went
by, and sometimes Scarlett had to leave the

351
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,790
room when Melanie talked about Ashley. But
Atlanta was more interesting than Tara, and

352
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:56,680
she was busy nursing at the hospital with
Mrs Meade, the doctor's wife, and other women.

353
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,800
All married women in Atlanta nursed the soldiers,
and most were glad to do it. But Scarlett

354
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,940
was a nurse only because she had to be.

355
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:15,440
'Melanie is content to stay at home and never
go to parties, and to wear black for her brother

356
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:22,880
when she's only eighteen years old,' thought
Scarlett. 'But she was never popular like

357
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:34,540
me and she doesn't miss the things I miss.
And she's got Ashley and I haven't got anybody!'

358
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,290
And she began to cry.

359
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:45,320
One afternoon, two ladies of the town - Mrs
Merriwether and Mrs Elsing - visited Aunt

360
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,330
Pitty.

361
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:53,430
'The McLure girls were called to Virginia
to bring home their brother,' Mrs Elsing told

362
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,850
them. 'He was hurt.'

363
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:04,450
'Pitty, we need you and Melanie to take their
places at the sale tonight,' said Mrs Merriwether.

364
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:11,510
'Oh, but we can't go,' said Aunt Pitty. 'With
poor Charlie dead only a-'

365
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:19,210
'Don't say "can't" to me, Pittypat Hamilton,'
said Mrs Merriwether. 'We need you to watch

366
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:26,410
the negroes with the food, and we need Melanie
for the McLure girls' table. Just remember,

367
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,370
it's to make money for the Cause!'

368
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:39,150
'I think we should go,' said Scarlett suddenly,
trying not to look too enthusiastic. 'We must

369
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,670
do it for the hospital.'

370
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:49,500
They all looked surprised that it was Scarlett
who offered, but Mrs Merriwether said, 'Scarlett's

371
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:55,070
right. You must all come.'

372
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,070
***

373
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,740
Scarlett sat behind a table with Melanie at
the sale. They were in a large room, which

374
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,200
was usually full of soldiers learning the
business of war. But tonight there were flowers

375
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,900
and coloured lights around the room, and music
was playing. There would be dancing soon,

376
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:21,230
but already Scarlett's feet were secretly
moving in time with the music.

377
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:29,060
Across the room, a tall man, dressed in black,
with a fine white shirt, was staring at her.

378
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:37,050
He smiled and she smiled back - until she
remembered who he was, and then her hand flew

379
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,920
to her mouth! It was Rhett Butler, and now
he was coming over!

380
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:52,440
'I did not think you would remember me, Miss
O'Hara,' he said. There was laughter in his

381
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:59,610
eyes, and Scarlett's face went bright red
as she remembered their last meeting.

382
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:05,820
Melanie turned at the sound of his voice.
'Oh, it's Mr Rhett Butler, isn't it?' she

383
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,990
said, smiling. 'I met you-'

384
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,500
'At Twelve Oaks,' he finished for her.

385
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:17,320
'What are you doing so far from Charleston,
Mr Butler?'

386
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:24,710
'Business,' he said. 'I find I must not only
bring things into your city but must also

387
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,500
stay here to sell them.'

388
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,630
Melanie gave him a delighted smile. 'You must
be the famous Captain Butler we've heard so

389
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:44,740
much about - the blockade runner. Scarlett,
what's the matter? Are you feeling faint?'

390
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:51,750
Scarlett sat down on a chair. 'Of all the
people to come here,' she was thinking, 'why

391
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,640
did he have to come?'

392
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:04,270
'It's quite warm in here,' Rhett was saying.
'Can I take you across to a window, Miss O'Hara?'

393
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:11,010
'No,' said Scarlett, so rudely that Melanie
stared.

394
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:20,010
'She's not Miss O'Hara any longer,' said Melanie,
smiling in a kind way. 'She is Mrs Hamilton,

395
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,530
and my sister now.'

396
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:30,560
'Oh,' said Rhett, looking closely at Scarlett.
'And are your husbands here tonight?'

397
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:41,950
'My husband is in Virginia,' said Melanie,
proudly. 'But Charles-' She could not go on.

398
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,610
'Charles is dead,' said Scarlett.

399
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:54,120
'My dear ladies!' said Rhett. 'I'm so sorry.
But to die for one's country is to live for

400
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,540
ever.'

401
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:03,550
Melanie smiled at him through her tears while
Scarlett felt herself hating him. 'He doesn't

402
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:08,370
mean a word,' she thought.

403
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:15,060
Melanie forgot about Captain Butler and Scarlett
as customers crowded round her table. Scarlett

404
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,930
sat quietly on her chair, wishing that Captain
Butler was back on his ship.

405
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:27,310
'Has your husband been dead long?' he asked
her.

406
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,390
'Yes, almost a year.'

407
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,930
'And this is the first time-?'

408
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:40,000
'I know it looks strange,' she said, 'but
the McLure girls couldn't come, so Melanie

409
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,650
and I came-'

410
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,420
'For the Cause,' he finished for her.

411
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:53,890
'Why does he make it sound so cheap?' thought
Scarlett. When Mrs Merriwether spoke of 'the

412
00:42:53,890 --> 00:43:00,410
Cause', she spoke proudly. Scarlett wanted
to tell him this but then remembered she was

413
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,360
only here because she was tired of sitting
at home.

414
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:11,660
He seemed to guess her thoughts, because he
said, 'Would you be here if the Confederacy

415
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,930
didn't need you, Mrs Hamilton?'

416
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:23,690
'Of course not,' said Scarlett. 'People would
think I hadn't loved-' And she stopped. She

417
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,400
could not pretend to him that she had loved
Charlie, not after the things he had heard

418
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,390
in the library at Twelve Oaks.

419
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:42,310
He moved close to her. 'Don't worry.' he whispered.
'Your guilty secret is safe with me!'

420
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:51,030
'How can you say those things!' she said,
angrily. But then she looked at him, saw the

421
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:58,370
laughter in his eyes and realized he was joking
with her - and she found herself laughing,

422
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,850
too.

423
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:06,290
Several people near them were shocked to see
Charles' widow laughing with a strange man,

424
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,970
and began to whisper about it.

425
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:17,001
Dr Meade called for everyone to be quiet.
'Gentlemen,' he said, 'if you want to dance

426
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:27,890
with a lady this evening, you must pay for
her! Remember, all the money is for the Cause!'

427
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:34,710
The young girls whispered excitedly, while
the men laughed. 'Oh, if only I could wear

428
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:41,220
an apple-green dress and have flowers in my
hair!' thought Scarlett. 'Twenty men would

429
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,790
fight to dance with me and pay their money
to the doctor!'

430
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:56,070
Rhett Butler was watching her. Suddenly, he
called out: 'Mrs Charles Hamilton - one hundred

431
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:06,590
and fifty dollars in gold!' Scarlett was so
surprised, she could not move. Everyone looked

432
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:13,620
at her, and she saw the doctor whisper to
Rhett Butler, probably telling him that widows

433
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,950
could not dance.

434
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:22,420
'Another one of our young ladies, perhaps?'
said Dr Meade.

435
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,160
'No,' said Rhett. 'Mrs Hamilton.'

436
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,800
'Impossible,' said the doctor. 'Mrs Hamilton
will not-'

437
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,830
'Yes, I will!' Scarlett heard herself shout.

438
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:45,170
She saw the shocked faces of Melanie and the
older women; she saw the surprised and annoyed

439
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:53,030
faces of the younger girls. But Scarlett didn't
care. She was going to dance again!

440
00:45:53,030 --> 00:46:04,440
'I - I'm doing it for the Cause,' Scarlett
told Rhett, and he began to laugh. 'Stop laughing,

441
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,370
everyone is looking at us!'

442
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:12,100
'Do you care if people talk?' said Rhett.

443
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:22,680
'No - but - well, a nice girl is supposed
to care.' She changed the subject. 'Tell me,

444
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,410
do you have a lot of money?'

445
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:34,880
'What a rude question, Mrs Hamilton!' he laughed.
'But the answer is yes, and I'll make a million

446
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:41,270
on the blockade. One can always make money
from a war, whether one is on the winning

447
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,980
side or not.'

448
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,360
'Do you think the Confederacy will lose?'

449
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,590
'Yes,' he said.

450
00:46:49,590 --> 00:47:00,550
'Oh, well, these things bore me,' said Scarlett.
'Captain Butler, don't hold me so tightly,

451
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,850
people are looking.'

452
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:09,490
'If no one was looking, would you care?' he
said, smiling.

453
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:18,420
'Captain Butler!' she said, pretending to
be shocked. Then added, 'You dance very well

454
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:24,560
for a big man, but it will be years and years
before I'll dance again.'

455
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:32,960
'I'll offer more money for you in the next
dance,' he said, 'and the next, and the next.'

456
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:40,270
'Oh, it's the end of the music,' said Scarlett.
'And here's Aunt Pittypat coming out of the

457
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:50,170
back room. I suppose Mrs Merriwether told
her. Her eyes are as big as saucers.'

458
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,170
***

459
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:57,450
'I don't care if they talk,' said Scarlett,
next morning. 'I'm sure I made more money

460
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,600
for the hospital than any girl there.'

461
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:11,150
'What does the money matter?' cried Aunt Pitty.
'Poor Charlie dead only a year! And that Captain

462
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,740
Butler is a terrible person, Scarlett.'

463
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:21,430
'I can't believe he's all that bad,' said
Melanie, gently. 'When you think how brave

464
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,500
he's been, running the blockade-'

465
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:31,380
'He isn't brave,' said Scarlett. 'He does
it for money. He doesn't care about the Confederacy,

466
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:38,550
and he says we're going to lose. But he dances
wonderfully.'

467
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,240
Pittypat and Melanie were so shocked they
could not speak.

468
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,330
'I'm tired of sitting at home and I'm not
going to do it any more,' Scarlett went on.

469
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:57,250
'If they all talked about me last night, then
it won't matter what they say about me now.'

470
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:04,470
Melanie put her arm round Scarlett. 'You did
a brave thing last night,' she said, 'and

471
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:12,000
it's going to help the hospital a lot. Aunt
Pitty, it's been difficult for Scarlett. And

472
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,280
war times aren't like other times. Think of
all the soldiers who are far from home and

473
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:25,300
without friends. We've been selfish. We must
have a soldier here to dinner every Sunday

474
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,470
from now on.'

475
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,780
CHAPTER FIVE

476
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,980
Heroes

477
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:43,130
The autumn of 1862 went quickly for Scarlett,
with nursing, parties and visits to Tara.

478
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:49,170
The visits to Tara were disappointing, because
Ellen worked from morning until night, and

479
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:56,270
Gerald was busy because he could not get a
manager to take Jonas Wilkerson's place. Suellen

480
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:02,670
was waiting for the war to end so that she
could marry Frank Kennedy, and Careen dreamed

481
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:10,150
about Brent Tarleton. So Scarlett was never
sorry to return from Tara to Atlanta.

482
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:17,630
There were many things she did not tell Ellen,
but her biggest secret was that Rhett Butler

483
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:24,630
called at Aunt Pittypat's house whenever he
was in town. Scarlett went riding with him

484
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:31,430
in his carriage, and he took her to dances
and sales. She looked forward to his visits

485
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:37,230
because there was something exciting about
him, something different from any other man

486
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:45,900
she knew. 'It's as if I'm in love with him!'
she thought. 'But I'm not.'

487
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:53,330
He sat and listened to Melanie for hours as
she talked about Ashley and how proud she

488
00:50:53,330 --> 00:51:01,600
was of him. 'But I only have to say Ashley's
name and he smiles nastily at me!' thought

489
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Scarlett.

490
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:09,850
'Why are you nicer to Melanie than to me?'
she asked him one day. 'I'm much prettier

491
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,390
than she is.'

492
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:16,350
'Dare I hope that you're jealous?' he said,
smiling.

493
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:20,400
'Don't be silly!' she said.

494
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,890
'Another hope gone! If I am "nicer" to Mrs
Wilkes, it's because she is one of the very

495
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:36,210
few kind and unselfish people I know. And,
although she is still young, she is one of

496
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:40,380
the few great ladies I have been lucky enough
to meet.'

497
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,650
'Don't you think I'm a great lady, too?' said
Scarlett.

498
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:54,690
'My dear, I think we agreed when we first
met that you were no lady at all,' said Rhett.

499
00:51:54,690 --> 00:52:03,770
'Oh, you rude, horrible man, reminding me
of that again!' she said. But he only laughed

500
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,180
at her.

501
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:14,010
The older men and women in Atlanta did not
like Rhett, but they agreed that he was brave.

502
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:19,670
But when they told him this, he replied that
he was as frightened as the 'brave boys' who

503
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:27,450
were fighting. This annoyed them because everyone
knew there wasn't a cowardly Confederate soldier

504
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:38,110
anywhere. He always said 'our brave boys'
or 'our heroes in grey', but made it sound

505
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:45,170
like an insult. And when young ladies thanked
him for being one of the heroes who fought

506
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:52,070
for them, he smiled and said that he would
do the same thing for Yankee women if the

507
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,010
Yankees paid him enough money.

508
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:02,390
At an evening of music at Mrs Elsing's home,
Rhett was talking with a group of men when

509
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:09,690
Scarlett heard an angry voice arguing with
him, 'Are you saying, sir, that the Cause

510
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:15,120
for which our heroes are dying is not sacred?'

511
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:21,680
'All wars are sacred to those who have to
fight them,' replied Rhett, in a bored and

512
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,440
lazy voice. 'If the people who started wars
didn't pretend they were sacred, who would

513
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:35,440
be foolish enough to fight? No, it's money
that wars are really fought about, but few

514
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:43,730
people realize it. Their ears are too full
of fine words from stay-at-home speakers.'

515
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:47,220
And before Scarlett could reach him, he was
leaving.

516
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:56,110
'Let him go,' said Mrs Elsing, holding her
arm. 'He's not one of us. He's a snake-in-the-grass

517
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,650
who we were foolish enough to invite into
our homes!'

518
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:08,700
Later, Mrs Merriwether rode home in Aunt Pitty's
carriage, and immediately said what she thought.

519
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:16,320
'He insulted us all and the Confederacy, too,'
she said. 'Saying that we were fighting for

520
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:23,690
money! Saying that our leaders have lied to
us! Pitty, you must never let that man into

521
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:29,931
your house again!' She turned to Scarlett
and Melanie. 'And I don't want to hear you

522
00:54:29,931 --> 00:54:36,640
two girls speaking to him again - Melanie,
what's the matter?'

523
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:44,480
Melanie was white and her eyes were wide open.
'I will speak to him again,' she said in a

524
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:52,180
low voice. 'I will not be rude to him. I will
not tell him to stay away from the house.'

525
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:59,320
Mrs Merriwether's mouth fell open, and Aunt
Pitty's did the same. Uncle Peter turned to

526
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,310
stare.

527
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:06,930
'Now why didn't I say that?' thought Scarlett.

528
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:12,920
Melanie's hands were shaking but she went
on quickly. 'I won't be rude to him because

529
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,570
of what he said, because it's - it's what
Ashley thinks.'

530
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:27,680
'Melanie Hamilton, that's a lie!' said Mrs
Merriwether. 'There was never a Wilkes who

531
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,520
was a coward-'

532
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:37,280
'I never said Ashley was a coward,' said Melanie.
'I said he thinks what Captain Butler thinks,

533
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,890
and he does. But he says it differently. In
his letters, Ashley says we should not be

534
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:52,080
fighting the Yankees. He says war isn't wonderful
or sacred or any of those things, it's just

535
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:58,140
dirty and useless and a terrible waste of
men's lives.'

536
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:04,300
Scarlett said nothing. She was shocked to
realize anyone as perfect as Ashley could

537
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:11,260
think the same as a man like Rhett Butler.
'They both understand what is true about the

538
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:19,280
war,' she thought, 'but Ashley will fight
and die for it and Rhett won't. I think that

539
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,000
shows Rhett is sensible.'

540
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,410
It was all very confusing.

541
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,410
CHAPTER SIX

542
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,690
Missing

543
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:39,250
In the early part of 1863, the war went well
for the Confederacy, but on the fourth day

544
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:45,230
of July, there was news about hard fighting
in Pennsylvania, near a little town called

545
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:53,810
Gettysburg. The news came slowly, and fear
began to spread across the town. Mothers prayed

546
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:59,760
that their boys were not in Pennsylvania,
but those who knew their relations were fighting

547
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,080
next to Dr Meade's son, Darcy, said they were
proud for them to be in the big fight that

548
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,070
would win the war.

549
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:15,560
In Aunt Pitty's house, the three women looked
into each other's eyes with fear. Ashley was

550
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,050
fighting with Darcy.

551
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:24,710
People waited outside the newspaper office
for news. Scarlett, Melanie and Aunt Pitty

552
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:31,810
came and waited in their carriage. Scarlett
saw Mrs Meade with her youngest son, Phil,

553
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:38,110
waiting for news of Darcy. Then the crowd
began to move as Rhett Butler came through

554
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:39,590
on his horse.

555
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:47,370
'The first lists will be out soon,' he said.
'Yes, look!'

556
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:53,750
The side window of the newspaper office opened
and a hand came out. In it were the lists

557
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:01,870
of the dead - long, narrow pieces of paper
with the names close together. The crowd began

558
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:07,230
to fight for them and there were shouts of,
'Let me through!'

559
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:12,690
Rhett got off his horse and pushed his way
forward, his heavy shoulders above the rest

560
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:21,090
of the crowd. Then he was back with five or
six lists in his hand. He gave one to Melanie,

561
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:25,340
and the others to the ladies in the carriages
near him.

562
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,880
Melanie's hands shook so much that she gave
the list to Scarlett, who quickly began to

563
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:41,309
read. 'White... Wilkins... Winn... Zebulon...
Oh, Melanie, he's not on it! He's not on it!'

564
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:47,490
Melanie began to cry with happiness, while
Scarlett's heart seemed ready to burst. Ashley

565
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:53,190
was alive! Ashley was alive!

566
00:58:53,190 --> 00:59:01,390
Mrs Meade sat in her carriage and looked across
at Melanie. 'Darcy won't need those new boots

567
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,740
now,' she said.

568
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:10,410
'Oh, my dear!' cried Melanie, and jumped from
her carriage.

569
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:18,520
'Mother, you've still got me,' said Phil.
'And if you'll just let me, I'll go and kill

570
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,490
all the Yankees-'

571
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,200
'No!' cried Mrs Meade.

572
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:31,490
'Phil Meade, don't talk like that!' said Melanie,
climbing in with Mrs Meade. 'Drive us home.

573
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:37,710
Captain Butler, can you tell the doctor? He's
at the hospital.'

574
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:45,530
Scarlett looked at the list again. So many
names from Atlanta, and from all of Georgia.

575
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:55,980
Calvert - Fontaine - Munroe. And surely there
couldn't be three Tarletons! But there were.

576
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:05,190
'Tarleton - Brenton, Stuart and Thomas.' And
Boyd killed the first year somewhere in Virginia.

577
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:09,710
All the Tarleton boys gone!

578
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:15,810
'I'm sorry, Scarlett,' said Rhett. 'Many of
your friends?'

579
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:24,380
'Yes,' she said. 'Oh, Rhett, why do there
have to be wars? Why didn't the Yankees just

580
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:30,180
pay for the negroes? Or why didn't we just
give them the negroes for nothing?'

581
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:38,510
'It isn't about the negroes, Scarlett,' he
said. 'They were just the excuse. There'll

582
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:51,440
always be wars because men love wars.' He
turned away. 'Now, I'm going to find Dr Meade.'

583
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,440
***

584
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,160
After losing the battle of Gettysburg, the
tired and much smaller Confederate army were

585
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:04,410
pushed back into Virginia for the winter.
As Christmas got closer, Ashley came home

586
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:11,790
for a week. His father and his sisters - Honey
and India - came to Atlanta to join him and

587
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,730
Melanie.

588
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:19,711
Scarlett wanted to cry with happiness when
she saw him. There was something new and strange

589
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:29,550
in the lines of his sun-burned face. He was
the same handsome Ashley, but much more exciting!

590
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:37,460
He looked at her and said, 'Oh, Scarlett!
You pretty, pretty thing!' and kissed her

591
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,170
on the cheek.

592
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:46,900
Each day she tried to speak to Ashley alone,
but Melanie was always with him. They all

593
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:52,980
had questions to ask him about the war but,
although he told them jokes and funny stories

594
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:59,250
about friends, it seemed to Scarlett that
he did this to stop them asking the questions

595
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:03,020
he did not want to answer.

596
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:10,490
The week passed quickly, and Ashley had to
return to Virginia. He said goodbye to Melanie

597
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:15,710
in their room, and then Scarlett was at last
able to see him alone.

598
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:21,760
'Ashley, may I go to the station with you?'
she asked him.

599
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:28,900
'Father and the girls will be there,' he said.
'I want to remember you saying goodbye here.

600
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,390
Will you let me do that?'

601
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:36,060
'Ashley, I'd do anything for you,' she said.

602
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:41,400
'Would you?' he said. 'There's something you
can do for me.'

603
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,610
'What is it?' she asked, happily.

604
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:49,880
'Will you look after Melanie for me?' he said.

605
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,420
'Look after Melanie?' she said, disappointed.

606
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:01,600
'She loves you so much,' he said. 'Scarlett,
when I think of what might happen to her if

607
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,440
I was killed-'

608
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,560
'Don't say it!' she said. 'It's bad luck to
speak of death!'

609
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:17,430
'I can't tell what will happen to me or to
any of us,' said Ashley. 'But when the end

610
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:26,170
comes, if I'm alive, I'll be far away from
here. Too far to look after Melanie.'

611
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:31,110
'The - the end?' said Scarlett.

612
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:36,700
'The end of the war - and the end of the world.'

613
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:43,160
'Ashley, surely you don't think the Yankees
will win.'

614
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:49,470
'All this week I've talked lies,' he said,
'I didn't want to frighten Melanie or Aunt

615
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:57,410
Pitty. But yes, Scarlett, I think the Yankees
will win. Gettysburg was the beginning of

616
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,410
the end.'

617
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:04,510
'I couldn't live if you were dead!' she thought
wildly.

618
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:11,570
'Don't repeat what I've said,' he told her.
'I don't want to frighten the others. You're

619
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:17,320
strong, and it will be good to know that you
and Melanie are together if anything happens

620
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:22,040
to me. You will promise, won't you?'

621
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:31,220
'Oh, yes!' she cried, ready to promise him
anything. 'Ashley! I can't let you go away!

622
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,770
I can't be brave about it!'

623
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:42,330
'You must be brave,' he said. He took her
face in his hands and kissed her lightly.

624
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:53,500
'Scarlett! Scarlett! You're so fine and good
and strong. So beautiful - not just your sweet

625
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:57,960
face, my dear, but your mind and your body.'

626
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:08,370
'Oh, Ashley,' she whispered happily, waiting
for him to say the three magic words 'I love

627
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:18,260
you'. But they didn't come. Instead, she heard
Uncle Peter with the carriage outside. 'Goodbye,'

628
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,620
Ashley said softly.

629
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:28,280
'Kiss me,' she whispered. 'Kiss me goodbye.'

630
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:34,390
At the first touch of his lips on hers, she
threw her arms around his neck and pulled

631
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:40,690
him to her. For a moment he held her close,
but then quickly pushed her away.

632
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:45,930
'No, Scarlett, no,' he said in a low voice.

633
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:51,860
'I love you!' she cried. 'Ashley, say you
love me!'

634
01:05:51,860 --> 01:06:00,200
She looked into his face - and it was the
unhappiest face she was ever to see. 'Goodbye!'

635
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:06,349
he said, his voice a whisper.

636
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:07,349
***

637
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:13,100
For the next two months, Scarlett was happy.
She had felt the quickness of Ashley's heart

638
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:22,070
when her arms went round his neck. She had
seen the look on his face. Oh, he loved her!

639
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:28,420
She was sure of this now, and could almost
feel sorry for Melanie.

640
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:36,140
But then in March Melanie said that she was
going to have a baby, and a sharp pain cut

641
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,680
right through Scarlett.

642
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:46,040
'Dr Meade says it will be here in late August
or September,' Melanie said happily. 'Oh,

643
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,000
Scarlett, isn't it wonderful?'

644
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:59,380
'Dear God!' thought Scarlett. 'A baby! Ashley's
baby. Oh, how could he when he loves me and

645
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:06,460
not Melanie? I can't go on living here now.
I'll go home to Tara.'

646
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:11,740
And the next morning she got up intending
to pack her things, but something happened

647
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,210
that stopped her.

648
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:20,970
News came that Ashley was missing. He'd been
missing for three days, after going on a five-man

649
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:27,250
search to discover where the Yankee army were
preparing to fight their next battle.

650
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:35,790
A shocked Scarlett was certain that God was
punishing her for loving a married man. Melanie's

651
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:41,970
face was white and frightened, like a child
lost in the dark.

652
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:52,720
'Scarlett,' she said. 'You're all I've got
now. Oh, I know Ashley is dead!' Suddenly,

653
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,940
she was in Scarlett's arms, and they were
crying and holding each other close.

654
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:02,700
'At least I've got his baby,' whispered Melanie.

655
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:11,860
'And I've got nothing,' thought Scarlett.
'Nothing but the look on his face when he

656
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,130
said goodbye.'

657
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,130
***

658
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:22,440
The first reports were 'Missing - believed
killed,' but they changed to 'Missing - believed

659
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:31,190
to be a prisoner.' Melanie, her hopes alive
again, met every train, praying for a letter.

660
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:37,859
She refused to obey Dr Meade and stay in bed,
and one afternoon she fainted at the station

661
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,799
and Rhett Butler brought her home.

662
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:48,870
'Mrs Wilkes, you're going to have a baby,
aren't you?' he said. And when she gave an

663
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:55,960
embarrassed nod, he went on, 'Then you must
take better care of yourself or you'll harm

664
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:04,020
the baby. I'll talk to some people I know
in Washington. If Mr Wilkes is a prisoner,

665
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:12,180
he'll be on a prisoners' list, and if he isn't
- well, there's nothing worse than not knowing.

666
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:17,620
But you must promise me you'll take care of
yourself, or I won't help.'

667
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:22,900
'Oh, you're so kind,' cried Melanie.

668
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:32,530
A month later, Rhett brought news that Ashley
was not dead but at Rock Island, a cruel and

669
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:39,010
terrible prison in Illinois where many men
would die before the end of the war.

670
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:47,160
'He had a chance to get out, but refused it,'
said Rhett. 'The Yankees need men to fight

671
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:52,960
the Indians in the West, and any prisoner
who will join the Yankee army and fight the

672
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,390
Indians for two years can get out of prison.'

673
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:04,680
'Why didn't he do that?' cried Scarlett. 'Why
didn't he join, and then run away and come

674
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:13,200
home as soon as he got out?' Melanie became
angry. 'How can you suggest that? I'd prefer

675
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:20,970
to know he was dead at Rock Island than he
was no longer a Confederate but a Yankee soldier!

676
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:24,640
Of course he refused.'

677
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,610
When Scarlett was alone with Rhett, she asked,
'Wouldn't you join the Yankees to get out

678
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:33,960
of that place, and then run away?'

679
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,570
'Of course,' said Rhett, with a cold smile.

680
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:42,640
'Then why didn't Ashley?' said Scarlett.

681
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:50,560
'He's a gentleman,' said Rhett - meaning Ashley
was a fool.

682
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,560
CHAPTER SEVEN

683
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,421
News from Tara

684
01:10:53,421 --> 01:11:00,920
That summer, for the first time since the
war began, the people of Atlanta heard the

685
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:09,520
sound of battle. The Yankees were getting
closer! Many old men, like John Wilkes, and

686
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,070
young boys, like Phil Meade, were sent to
guard the bridges at Chattahoochee River,

687
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:18,080
at the back of the main Confederate army.

688
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:26,270
Then, on a hot July afternoon, after a terrible
battle at Peachtree Creek, a stream of Confederate

689
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:33,210
soldiers began to arrive in Atlanta. Some
were covered in blood, others helped those

690
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:36,340
who couldn't walk to get to the hospitals.

691
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:43,380
Within days, the Yankees were on three sides
of Atlanta, and the railway to Tennessee was

692
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:51,021
under Yankee control. Only one railway to
the south, to Macon, was still open. But if

693
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:56,150
they could hold it, Atlanta could stand against
the Yankees.

694
01:11:56,150 --> 01:12:03,040
But when shells began to fall in the streets,
women, children and old people began leaving

695
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:10,660
the city. Mrs Elsing and Mrs Merriwether refused
to leave. They were needed at the hospital,

696
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:17,601
they said proudly, and no Yankee was going
to run them out of their homes. Mrs Meade

697
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:25,950
also refused. Phil was fighting not far away
and she wanted to be near. Aunt Pitty was

698
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:33,440
among the first to leave. She went to Macon
to stay with a cousin. 'You girls should come

699
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,580
with me,' she said.

700
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:42,810
But Scarlett did not like Aunt Pitty's cousin.
'I'll go to Tara, and Melanie can go to Macon

701
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,590
with you,' she said.

702
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:52,060
'Scarlett, don't leave me!' cried Melanie.
'I'll die if you aren't with me when the baby

703
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:58,570
comes! You promised Ashley that you'd take
care of me. He told me he was going to ask

704
01:12:58,570 --> 01:12:59,570
you.'

705
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:07,730
'I'll keep my promise,' Scarlett said, tiredly,
'but I won't go to Macon. I'll go home to

706
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:10,500
Tara, and you can come with me.'

707
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:18,590
But Dr Meade stopped Melanie going to Macon
or Tara. 'You cannot travel,' he said. 'It

708
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:25,930
might be dangerous. Miss Pitty, you go to
Macon and leave the young ladies here. Miss

709
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:31,330
Melanie, you must stay in bed until the baby
comes.'

710
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:38,990
He spoke privately to Scarlett 'She is going
to have a difficult time,' he said. 'You must

711
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:47,640
stay with her until the baby comes. With these
shells falling, it may be at any time.'

712
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:53,900
So Aunt Pitty went to Macon, taking Uncle
Peter with her. And Scarlett and Melanie were

713
01:13:53,900 --> 01:14:00,540
left alone in Atlanta with Wade and Prissy.

714
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,540
***

715
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:06,540
Those first days, Scarlett would not go into
the streets. Every time she heard the scream

716
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:12,330
of a shell coming, she rushed to Melanie's
room and threw herself on the bed, and the

717
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:19,350
two of them hid their heads in the pillow.
Prissy and Wade hid under a table downstairs,

718
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:22,670
Wade crying and Prissy screaming.

719
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:30,050
'I'd rather let Melanie die than go out and
find the doctor when the shells are falling,'

720
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,000
thought Scarlett.

721
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,060
But Prissy calmed Scarlett's fears. 'Don't
you worry, Miss Scarlett. I know all about

722
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:48,810
deliverin' babies,' she said. 'Ain't my mother
told me all about it? Just leave it to me.'

723
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:55,780
At the end of July, Scarlett received a letter
from Gerald telling her that Careen was ill

724
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:03,960
with typhoid and that Scarlett must not come
home. That night, she sat outside the house

725
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:11,620
and thought of Tara. Life there would never
be the same. She would never again hear the

726
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:19,361
wild, happy voices of the Tarleton boys. Or
the Munroe boys, or little Joe Fontaine, or

727
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:20,680
-

728
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:27,210
The front gate opened and she quickly brushed
tears from her face before looking up.

729
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:35,770
It was Rhett Butler. 'So you didn't go to
Macon,' he said. 'Why did you stay?'

730
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:42,560
'To be with Melanie. She - well, she can't
go just now.'

731
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:52,840
'Is Mrs Wilkes still here?' he said. He lit
a cigar. 'And you stayed with her. How strange.'

732
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,630
'I see nothing strange about it,' she said,
uncomfortably.

733
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:05,960
'You think Mrs Wilkes is silly and stupid,'
he said. 'So why do you stay when there are

734
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,220
Yankee shells falling all around?'

735
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:16,960
'Because she's Charlie's sister and - and
like a sister to me,' said Scarlett, her cheeks

736
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,000
getting hot.

737
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,530
'You mean because she's Ashley Wilkes' widow,'
said Rhett.

738
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:31,080
Scarlett became angry. She liked to think
she was a mystery to men, but Rhett could

739
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,840
see through her like glass.

740
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:42,540
He took her hand in his. 'How lucky, to find
you alone,' he said, and something in his

741
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:46,870
voice made her face go hot again.

742
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:52,760
'He's going to tell me he loves me!' she thought.
'Then I can tell him he's wasting his time,

743
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,420
and he'll feel a fool!'

744
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:02,920
He kissed her hand, and something electric
passed through her whole body as his warm

745
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:10,610
mouth touched her skin. 'I'm not in love with
him,' she told herself. 'I'm in love with

746
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,580
Ashley.'

747
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:19,130
'Scarlett, you do like me, don't you?' he
said.

748
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:24,290
'Well... sometimes,' she said.

749
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,920
'Could you ever love me?'

750
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:34,000
'I've got him!' she thought, and answered
in a cool voice. 'Certainly not! Not until

751
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,460
you behave like a real gentleman.'

752
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:47,000
'And I don't intend to do that,' he said.
'So you don't love me? Good, because although

753
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:55,250
I like you, Scarlett, I don't love you, and
I didn't want to be the second man not to

754
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:59,130
return your love, my dear.'

755
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:04,920
'You - you don't love me?' she said.

756
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:11,560
'Did you hope that I did? I'm sorry. But I
do like you a lot. I know you still think

757
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:19,140
lovingly of the wooden-headed Mr Wilkes, who
has probably been dead these last six months.

758
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:27,000
But there must be room in your heart for me,
too. Scarlett, I want you more than I've ever

759
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,470
wanted any woman.'

760
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:39,050
Scarlett was surprised and confused. 'Are
you asking me to marry you?' she said.

761
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:46,560
He dropped her hand and laughed loudly. 'No,
I'm not a marrying man, didn't I tell you

762
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,560
that?'

763
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,860
'But - but - what-?'

764
01:18:49,860 --> 01:19:03,210
'My dear,' he said quietly. 'I'm asking you
to be my lover.' Lover! Scarlett felt shock

765
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:11,380
and disappointment at the same time. 'Get
out!' she cried. 'Get out and don't ever come

766
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:18,070
back! I'll - I'll tell my father, and he'll
kill you!'

767
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:25,690
She watched him smile. He was not ashamed,
he was amused! She ran into the house and

768
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:29,960
tried to crash the door shut behind her, but
it was too heavy.

769
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,790
'May I help you?' he asked.

770
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:38,000
And he crashed it shut for her as she ran
upstairs.

771
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
***

772
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:47,650
As the hot, noisy days of August came to an
end, the shelling stopped. Then worrying news

773
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:54,360
came from the south. The Yankees were trying
to take the railway at Jonesboro, and Tara

774
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:00,830
was close to the fighting. Eventually a soldier
came to say that the Confederate army had

775
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:07,620
pushed the Yankees back, but the railway was
damaged and it would be some time before trains

776
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:13,750
could travel again. He brought Scarlett a
letter from her father, after meeting him

777
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:19,660
in Jonesboro, and was able to tell her that
the Yankees hadn't got to Tara.

778
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:24,420
'But what was Pa doing in Jonesboro?' she
asked.

779
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:33,380
The soldier looked nervous. 'He - he was looking
for an army doctor to go to Tara with him,'

780
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,850
he said.

781
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:40,510
Scarlett opened her father's letter and began
to read:

782
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:47,760
Dear Daughter, Your mother and both girls
have typhoid and are very ill, but we must

783
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:54,110
hope for the best. When your mother went to
her bed, she told me to write and say that

784
01:20:54,110 --> 01:21:01,910
you must not come home and put yourself and
Wade in danger, too. She sends her love and

785
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:04,580
asks you to pray for her.

786
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:13,560
For the next week, Scarlett waited nervously
for more news, but none came. No one knew

787
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,820
where the Confederates were, or what the Yankees
were doing. She had seen enough typhoid in

788
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:25,360
the Atlanta hospitals to know that a week
was a long time with that terrible illness,

789
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:31,810
and she wanted to be at home. 'Oh, why doesn't
this baby come?' she thought.

790
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:41,150
The last day of August arrived, and with it
came rumours of a big battle south of Atlanta.

791
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:49,880
People waited for news. If the Yankees won
the Macon railway, they would soon be in Atlanta!

792
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:57,570
On the first of September, Scarlett woke to
hear a sound like distant thunder. 'Rain coming,'

793
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:04,960
she thought at first. Then she went to the
window. 'No, not rain, guns! And from the

794
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:12,020
south!' There lay Jonesboro, Tara - and her
mother.

795
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:17,710
Scarlett went to Melanie's room. Melanie was
in bed, her eyes closed and with dark circles

796
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:25,070
around them. She looked worse than any sick
person Scarlett had ever seen. Then her eyes

797
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:29,180
opened and a soft warm smile lit her face.

798
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:37,170
'Scarlett,' she said. 'There's something I
want to ask you.' Scarlett sat down on the

799
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:41,540
bed and Melanie held her hand.

800
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:49,250
'I'm sorry about the guns, dear,' said Melanie.
'They're towards Jonesboro, aren't they? I

801
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:56,330
know how worried you are. You could be at
home if it weren't for me, couldn't you?'

802
01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:00,450
'Yes,' said Scarlett, rudely.

803
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:10,190
'You're so good to me, and I love you for
it. If I die, I want you to take my baby.

804
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:12,900
Will you do that?'

805
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:18,630
Scarlett pulled her hand away, frightened.
'Don't be silly, Melanie,' she said. 'You're

806
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:19,950
not going to die.'

807
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:29,500
'Promise me, Scarlett, then I won't be afraid,'
said Melanie. 'I'm sure my baby will come

808
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,860
today.'

809
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:38,460
'Oh, all right, I promise,' said Scarlett.
'Why do you think it will come today?'

810
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:43,050
'I've been having pains.'

811
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:47,500
'I'll send Prissy for Dr Meade,' said Scarlett.

812
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:56,870
'No, you know how busy he is. Just send for
Mrs Meade.'

813
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,950
CHAPTER EIGHT

814
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:02,770
The Yankees Are Coming

815
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:09,170
Scarlett sent Prissy for Mrs Meade and, after
a long time, the little black girl returned

816
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,170
alone.

817
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:17,480
'She wasn't there,' said Prissy. 'She got
news that Mr Phil was shot and she went with

818
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,210
a carriage to fetch him home.'

819
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:29,710
Scarlett stared, wanting to shake her. 'Well,
don't just stand there, go and fetch Mrs Merriwether!'

820
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:37,630
'She ain't there,' said Prissy. 'I stopped
on my way home, but the house was shut up.

821
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:41,100
She's probably at the hospital.'

822
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:46,990
Scarlett thought for a moment. 'Go to Mrs
Elsing and explain everything,' she said.

823
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:51,250
'Ask her to come. And hurry!'

824
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:58,690
She went back to Melanie's room where Melanie
was lying on her side, her face white. 'Mrs

825
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:04,590
Meade is at the hospital,' lied Scarlett.
She didn't want to worry Melanie by telling

826
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:11,470
her about Phil getting shot. 'But Mrs Elsing
is coming.'

827
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:18,770
It was an hour before Prissy came back, walking
slowly along the road. Scarlett hurried out

828
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,380
to meet her.

829
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:27,510
'Mrs Elsing is over at the hospital,' said
Prissy. 'A lot of soldiers came in on the

830
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:31,820
early train, most of them hurt bad-'

831
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:38,630
'You must go to the hospital,' said Scarlett.
'I'll give you a letter for Dr Meade, but

832
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:45,880
if he isn't there, give it to one of the other
doctors. And hurry back this time!'

833
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:53,750
Minutes later, Prissy went off with a letter
and Scarlett went back upstairs. Melanie asked

834
01:25:53,750 --> 01:26:02,540
no questions, but her face was full of pain.
An hour passed and then another. Afternoon

835
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:11,420
came, and Melanie's pains were worse. Where
was Prissy? Why didn't she come? Scarlett

836
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:19,281
went to the window. Had the sound of the guns
died away, or was it her imagination? Then

837
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:26,790
she saw Prissy running down the street, fear
written all over her little black face. Scarlett

838
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:29,960
quickly moved from the window.

839
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:34,290
'I'll get some cooler water,' she told Melanie.

840
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:40,840
She got downstairs as Prissy came in. 'They're
fighting at Jonesboro, Miss Scarlett! They

841
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:44,030
say we're losing the war!'

842
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:48,930
'Where's Dr Meade? When is he conning?' said
Scarlett.

843
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:55,820
'He ain't at the hospital. Mrs Merriwether
and Mrs Elsin's ain't there either. A man

844
01:26:55,820 --> 01:27:01,750
told me the doctor was down at the railway
station with the soldiers from Jonesboro.

845
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:08,170
But, Miss Scarlett, I was too frightened to
go down there. People are dying down there,

846
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:10,830
and I'm frightened of dead people.'

847
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:15,370
'What about the other doctors?' asked Scarlett.

848
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:22,170
'Miss Scarlett, I couldn't get them to read
your letter,' said Prissy. 'They're working

849
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:29,780
in the hospital like they're all crazy! "Don't
worry me about babies when we've got men dying

850
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,440
here!" one of them shouted at me.'

851
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:39,450
'Listen,' said Scarlett. 'I'll get Dr Meade
and you sit with Miss Melanie. Don't tell

852
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:44,651
her where the fighting is, and don't tell
her that the other doctors won't come, do

853
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:47,290
you hear?'

854
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:53,220
Scarlett hurried out of the house and into
the hot sun. A soldier came riding past and

855
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,520
she stopped him.

856
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,900
'Are the Yankees coming?' she asked him.

857
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:07,091
'Yes, Miss,' he said. 'The army are leaving
Atlanta soon.' Scarlett began to run. People

858
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:13,300
rushed past her as she pushed her way through
the crowd and on towards the station. But

859
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:18,100
as she went round the side of the Atlanta
Hotel, she stopped.

860
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:24,900
There, lying on the ground under the heat
of the sun, were hundreds and hundreds of

861
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:33,370
men. Some were screaming with pain. There
was blood everywhere, and the smell of unwashed

862
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:39,560
bodies came to meet her. She put a hand across
her mouth and nose.

863
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:46,630
Then she lifted her skirts and stepped over
dead men, and men with blood on their uniforms,

864
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:52,260
and men making sounds which had to mean: 'Water!
Water!'

865
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:58,210
'Dr Meade!' cried Scarlett. 'Is Dr Meade here?'

866
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:06,740
A man looked up. It was the doctor. His shirt
and trousers were red with blood, and his

867
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,620
face was grey with tiredness.

868
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:16,900
'Thank God you're here,' he said to Scarlett.
'I can use every pair of hands. Quickly, come

869
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,520
here!'

870
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:25,650
She went to him as fast as she could across
the rows of bodies. 'Doctor, you must come!

871
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:29,380
Melanie is having her baby!'

872
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:38,240
'Baby?' thundered the doctor. 'Are you crazy?
I can't leave these men. Get some woman to

873
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:43,640
help you. Get my wife.'

874
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:50,120
She started to tell him why Mrs Meade could
not come - then stopped. She could not tell

875
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,420
him his son was hurt.

876
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:58,180
'Doctor, please!' she cried. 'Please come!'

877
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:04,550
He looked at her. 'The Yankees are coming
and the army is moving out of town. I don't

878
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:09,920
know what they'll do with these men. There
aren't any trains. The Macon line is under

879
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:17,780
Yankee control. Listen, I can't promise, Scarlett,
but I'll try.'

880
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:24,390
Scarlett went back through the rows of men.
On the streets beyond the Atlanta Hotel, soldiers

881
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:31,460
were moving out of the city. There seemed
to be thousands of them. Wagons went past,

882
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:39,120
throwing up clouds of dust. There were drunken
women with painted faces among the crowd.

883
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:47,050
Scarlett saw Belle Wading, and heard her drunken
laugh as she held on to a one-armed soldier.

884
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:53,960
Scarlett began to run again. When she got
back to the house, Wade was waiting outside.

885
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,860
'Wade hungry,' he cried.

886
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:06,060
'Be quiet!' said Scarlett. 'Go and play in
the back garden.' She looked up and saw Prissy

887
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:13,430
at the bedroom window. Scarlett waved at her
to come down, then went into the house. Prissy

888
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:16,110
came down the stairs three at a time.

889
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:24,950
'The doctors can't come,' said Scarlett. 'You've
got to deliver the baby, and I'll help you.'

890
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,910
Prissy's mouth fell open.

891
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:31,370
'What's the matter?' said Scarlett.

892
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:39,760
'I - Miss Scarlett - I don't know nothin'
about deliverin' babies,' said Prissy, looking

893
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,970
at the floor.

894
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:48,550
Scarlett took Prissy's arm and squeezed it.
'You black liar! What do you mean? You said

895
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,030
you knew everything about-'

896
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:56,320
'I was lyin', Miss Scarlett!' cried Prissy.

897
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:02,020
Scarlett had never hit a slave in all her
life, but she hit Prissy's black cheek as

898
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:07,560
hard as she could. Prissy screamed loudly
and tried to pull away.

899
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:20,970
'Scarlett, is it you?' Melanie's weak voice
came from upstairs. 'Please come! Please!'

900
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:27,670
Scarlett tried to remember what Mammy and
Ellen did when Wade was born. 'Build a fire

901
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:33,610
and make sure there's plenty of water,' she
told Prissy. 'Bring all the towels you can

902
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:40,210
find, and some string and a pair of scissors.
Quickly!'

903
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:47,700
She pushed Prissy towards the kitchen, then
took a deep breath before going upstairs.

904
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:48,700
***

905
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:55,270
There was never an afternoon as long as this
one. Or as hot. Scarlett pulled the bedroom

906
01:32:55,270 --> 01:33:02,540
curtains across to keep out the sun. Melanie
tried to be brave, but when evening came,

907
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:09,790
she began calling for Ashley - over and over
- until Scarlett wanted to cover her face

908
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:17,040
with a pillow. 'Perhaps the doctor will come
after all,' thought Scarlett, and she told

909
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:22,860
Prissy to go to the Meades' house and see
if he or Mrs Meade were there.

910
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:26,760
Prissy went, but came back soon after, alone.

911
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:35,600
'The doctor ain't been home all day,' she
reported. 'An', Miss Scarlett, Mr Phil is

912
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:43,190
dead. He was shot. I didn't see Mrs Meade
because she was gettin' his body ready for-'

913
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:47,130
'All right,' said Scarlett quickly.

914
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:50,270
Melanie opened her eyes and whispered, 'Are
the Yankees coming?'

915
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:55,570
'No,' said Scarlett. 'Prissy's a liar.'

916
01:33:55,570 --> 01:34:01,170
'Yes, Miss, I am,' agreed Prissy.

917
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:10,080
'The Yankees are coming,' whispered Melanie,
guessing correctly. 'My poor baby. Scarlett,

918
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,160
you mustn't stay here.'

919
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:18,640
'You know I won't leave you,' said Scarlett.

920
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:28,240
'Why not?' said Melanie. 'I'm going to die
anyway.'

921
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,820
CHAPTER NINE

922
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:33,490
Escape from Atlanta

923
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:39,950
Scarlett came down the dark stairs slowly,
like an old woman. She went outside and sat

924
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:48,690
on the front step. It was all over. Melanie
was not dead, and Prissy was giving the small

925
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:53,630
baby boy his first bath while Melanie was
asleep.

926
01:34:53,630 --> 01:35:02,360
The night air was cool and fresh on her face
and arms. More soldiers were leaving the city,

927
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,910
passing by the house, although she could not
see them clearly in the darkness.

928
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:17,860
What could she do? Where could she turn for
help? Scarlett remembered Rhett. He was strong

929
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:26,720
and clever, and he wasn't afraid of the Yankees.
And he had a horse and carriage, too.

930
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:34,630
She called Prissy. 'Captain Butler lives at
the Atlanta Hotel,' she said. 'Go there quickly

931
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:40,620
and tell him about the baby. Tell him that
I want him to get us out of here.'

932
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:45,860
'Suppose Cap'n Butler ain't at the hotel?'
said Prissy.

933
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:53,110
'Go to the bar-rooms, go to Belle Watling's
house,' said Scarlett. 'Just find him, or

934
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:57,360
the Yankees will get us all!'

935
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:03,360
Scarlett went back into the house and waited.
After some time, she saw that the sky was

936
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:11,720
becoming pink over the east of the city. Then
a large flame shot high into the darkness.

937
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:17,520
'The Yankees are burning the city!' she thought.

938
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,310
Moments later, Prissy ran into the room.

939
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:22,680
'The Yankees-?' Scarlett began.

940
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:30,350
'No, it's our men,' said Prissy. 'They're
burnin' the gun factory, an' what the army

941
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:34,160
left. We're all going to burn up!'

942
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:38,000
'Did you see Captain Butler?' said Scarlett.

943
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:46,310
'Yes, I saw him, an' I says "Come quick, Cap'n
Butler, and bring your horse and carriage."

944
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:51,780
And he says they took his horse but he'll
steal another one.'

945
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,890
'He's coming? He's going to bring a horse?'

946
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:58,070
'So he says.'

947
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:05,239
Scarlett began to feel better. She would forgive
Rhett anything if he got them out of this

948
01:37:05,239 --> 01:37:12,739
mess. 'Wake up Wade and dress him,' she told
Prissy. 'Then pack some clothes for all of

949
01:37:12,739 --> 01:37:19,940
us. Don't tell Miss Melanie we're going, not
yet, but put two thick towels around the baby

950
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:24,120
and pack his clothes, too.'

951
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:29,970
It seemed hours before Rhett finally came
with a wagon. He was dressed as if he was

952
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:37,180
going dancing, in a white coat and trousers.
He carried two guns, and his pockets were

953
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:38,989
full of bullets.

954
01:37:38,989 --> 01:37:48,350
'Good evening,' he said, smiling and taking
off his hat. 'Fine weather we're having! I

955
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:50,220
hear you're going on a trip.'

956
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:59,520
'If you make any jokes, I'll never speak to
you again,' said Scarlett, her voice shaking.

957
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,980
'You're frightened!' He pretended to be surprised.

958
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:12,250
'Yes, I am! And if you had any sense, you'd
be frightened, too!' she said. 'We must get

959
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,670
out of here.'

960
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:19,870
'And where are you going?' he asked politely.

961
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:23,440
'I'm going home,' she said.

962
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:32,130
'You mean to Tara?' he said. 'Scarlett, are
you mad? The Yankees may be all over Tara

963
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:36,610
by now. You can't go right through the Yankee
army!'

964
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:46,100
'I will go home!' she cried, tears running
down her cheeks. Suddenly, she was in his

965
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:54,360
arms. His hands smoothed her hair gently,
and when he spoke his voice was gentle, too.

966
01:38:54,360 --> 01:39:02,830
'Don't cry, my brave little girl,' he said.
'I'll take you home.'

967
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:03,830
***

968
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:08,210
Rhett turned west along the narrow street,
and the wheel of the wagon hit a stone so

969
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:14,940
hard that Melanie cried out in the back of
the wagon. Wade and Prissy were next to her

970
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:19,910
with the new baby. Scarlett was in the front
next to Rhett.

971
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:25,210
'Must we go through the fire?' she asked him.

972
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:28,310
'Not if we hurry,' he said.

973
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:34,400
He stopped the horse suddenly. 'Soldiers,'
he said.

974
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:40,720
Long lines of Confederate soldiers walked
through Marietta Street, too tired to care

975
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:47,710
about the burning buildings around them. Many
had no shoes, and their uniforms were torn

976
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:54,960
and dirty. They went past silently, like ghosts.

977
01:39:54,960 --> 01:40:02,200
'Take a good look,' said Rhett, 'so you can
tell your grandchildren that you saw the last

978
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:06,280
soliders of the sacred Cause.'

979
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:13,640
Suddenly she hated him for insulting these
broken men. She thought of Charles, of Ashley

980
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:21,900
who might be dead, and all those brave young
boys, now dead. She forgot that she had once

981
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:25,380
thought they were fools.

982
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:31,800
Rhett watched the soldiers with a strange
and thoughtful look on his face. Then there

983
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:38,720
was a crash of falling wood and Scarlett saw
a thin flame above the building next to them.

984
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:44,010
'Rhett, hurry!' she shouted.

985
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:49,720
They went quickly from one narrow street to
another until the sound of the flames died

986
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:57,200
behind them. Rhett did not speak. His face
looked cold and hard, as if he'd forgotten

987
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:06,300
where he was. Scarlett wanted him to say something
- anything - but he only sat and stared at

988
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,850
the dark road ahead.

989
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:15,710
'Oh, Rhett,' she said. 'I'm so glad you aren't
in the army!'

990
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:24,790
At this, he turned his head - and she saw
in his eyes how angry and confused he was.

991
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:28,040
After that, she said nothing.

992
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:33,650
At last, they were on a wider, smoother road.

993
01:41:33,650 --> 01:41:41,901
'We're out of the city,' said Rhett. 'Do you
still want to do this crazy thing? The Yankee

994
01:41:41,901 --> 01:41:45,470
army are between you and Tara.'

995
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:50,170
'Yes!' she said. 'Please, Rhett, let's hurry!'

996
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:56,840
'You can't go to Jonesboro down this road,'
he said, 'they've been fighting up and down

997
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:00,820
there all day. Do you know any wagon paths?'

998
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:09,470
'Oh, yes,' cried Scarlett. 'I know a wagon
path. Pa and I used to ride it. It comes out

999
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,900
only a mile from Tara.'

1000
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:18,490
'Good,' said Rhett. 'Maybe the Yankees aren't
there yet. Maybe you can get through if-'

1001
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:23,800
'I can get through? Aren't you going to take
us?'

1002
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,580
'No,' he said. 'I'm leaving you here.'

1003
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:34,590
'Leaving us?' she said wildly. 'Where are
you going?'

1004
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:36,050
'I'm going with the army,' he said.

1005
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,050
'Rhett, stop joking!'

1006
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:38,050
'I'm not joking, my dear,' he said, smiling.
'Think how delighted our soldiers will be

1007
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:39,050
at my last-minute appearance.'

1008
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:40,050
'Oh, Rhett!' she cried. 'Why are you going?'

1009
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,050
He laughed. 'Perhaps because I'm a Southerner,
and I'm ashamed. Who knows?'

1010
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:42,050
'You should die of shame, leaving us alone
and helpless-'

1011
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:43,050
'Scarlett, anyone as selfish and strong-minded
as you is never helpless. God help the Yankees

1012
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:44,050
if they get you!' He stepped down from the
wagon. Then he put his hands up, caught her

1013
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:45,050
under the arms and brought her to the ground
next to him. He took her several steps away

1014
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:46,050
from the wagon. 'I'm not asking you to understand
or forgive,' he said. 'I'll never understand

1015
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:47,050
or forgive myself for this foolishness. But
the South needs every man, so I'm off to the

1016
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:48,050
wars.' His warm, strong hands moved up her
arms. 'I do love you, Scarlett, although I

1017
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,050
told you I didn't. Do you want to change your
mind about what I suggested before? A soldier

1018
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:50,050
would go to his death with beautiful memories.'

1019
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:51,050
He was kissing her now with slow, hot lips.
Charles had never kissed her like this. The

1020
01:42:51,050 --> 01:42:52,050
kisses of the Tarleton and Calvert boys never
made her go hot and cold like this.

1021
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:53,050
A voice came from the wagon. It was Wade's.

1022
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:54,050
'Wade frightened!'

1023
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:55,050
And suddenly Scarlett remembered that she
was frightened, too, and that Rhett was leaving

1024
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,050
her. And on top of it all, he was insulting
her with his shocking suggestions!

1025
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:57,050
She pulled herself away from him. 'You coward!'
she screamed. 'You nasty, horrible thing!'

1026
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:58,050
And she hit him across the mouth with all
her strength.

1027
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:59,050
He put a hand to his face. 'I see,' he said
quietly.

1028
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,050
'Go on!' cried Scarlett. 'I don't want to
see you ever again! I hope a shell lands right

1029
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:01,050
on you. I hope it blows you into a million
pieces. I hope-'

1030
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,050
'Never mind the rest,' said Rhett, smiling.
'I understand your general idea.' He walked

1031
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,050
back to the wagon. 'Mrs Wilkes?'

1032
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:04,050
Prissy's frightened voice answered from the
wagon. 'Miss Melanie fainted a long way back,

1033
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:05,050
Cap'n Butler.'

1034
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,050
'That's probably best,' he said. 'If she was
awake, I doubt that she could live through

1035
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:07,050
all the pain. Take good care of her, Prissy.'
He turned round. 'Goodbye, Scarlett.'

1036
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:08,050
Scarlett knew he was looking at her but she
did not speak. She saw his big shoulders moving

1037
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,050
in the dark, then he was gone. She came slowly
back to the wagon, her knees shaking. She

1038
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:10,050
put her head against the neck of the horse
and cried.

1039
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,050
CHAPTER TEN

1040
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,050
Home

1041
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,050
Many times on that journey Scarlett heard
soldiers coming, and had to hide the wagon

1042
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:14,050
in fields among the trees; then wait while
the men went past like ghosts in the darkness.

1043
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:15,050
She lost her way and cried when she could
not find the little wagon path she knew so

1044
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:16,050
well. But a few miles after she found it,
the horse dropped to its knees, too tired

1045
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:17,050
to go any further.

1046
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:18,050
Scarlett climbed into the back of the wagon,
heard Melanie whisper, 'Scarlett, can I have

1047
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:19,050
some water please?' and heard herself answer,
'There isn't any,' before she went to sleep.

1048
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:20,050
When she woke, the sun was pouring through
the trees and everything was silent. She sat

1049
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:21,050
up and looked round quickly, but there were
no soldiers anywhere. In the wagon, Melanie

1050
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:22,050
lay so still and white that at first Scarlett
thought she must be dead, but then she saw

1051
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:23,050
Melanie's shallow breathing.

1052
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:24,050
They were under some trees in someone's front
garden, Scarlett noticed. 'It's the Mallory

1053
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:25,050
place!' she thought, excited at the thought
of friends and help. But the stillness of

1054
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:26,050
death lay over the plantation and, when she
looked towards the house, there were only

1055
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:27,050
some smoke-blackened stones left.

1056
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:28,050
'Is this what Tara will be like?' she thought.

1057
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:29,050
She woke Prissy, then looked over and saw
that Melanie's eyes were open.

1058
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:30,050
Scarlett found some apples under the trees,
then got some water from a stream near the

1059
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:31,050
house. They all had a drink, then Scarlett
gave the rest of the water to the horse. The

1060
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:32,050
animal was on its feet again but it was very
old, she saw now.

1061
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:33,050
They were fifteen miles from Tara, but the
horse moved so slowly it took all day to travel

1062
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,050
there. Every empty, burned-out house they
passed frightened Scarlett more. There were

1063
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:35,050
dead men and dead horses lying by the road,
and the fields and trees seemed full of ghosts

1064
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:36,050
in the afternoon sun.

1065
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:37,050
There was a sudden noise and Prissy screamed
loudly. But it was only a cow coming from

1066
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:38,050
behind some trees. The animal looked at them
with large, frightened eyes.

1067
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:39,050
'She needs milking,' said Prissy.

1068
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:40,050
'It must be one of Mr Macintosh's that the
Yankees didn't get,' said Scarlett. 'We'll

1069
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:41,050
take it with us, then we can have some milk
for the baby.'

1070
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:42,050
It was evening when they reached the top of
a hill and went down through the line of trees

1071
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:43,050
that led to Tara. Was it there? Or was the
darkness hiding just a few smoke-blackened

1072
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,050
stones like the Macintosh place? But no! Tara
had escaped! It was there! The white walls

1073
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:45,050
showed through the darkness.

1074
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:46,050
Then Scarlett saw a shadow come from inside
the house. Someone was home! A shout of delight

1075
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:47,050
started in her throat - but died there. The
shadow did not move or call to her but, stiffly

1076
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:48,050
and slowly, came down the steps.

1077
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:49,050
'Pa?' she whispered. 'It's me, Scarlett. I've
come home.'

1078
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:50,050
Her father looked at her. 'Daughter,' he said.
'Daughter.'

1079
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:51,050
'He's an old man!' thought Scarlett, shocked.

1080
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,050
A baby's cry came from the wagon and Gerald
looked across.

1081
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:53,050
'It's Melanie and her baby,' whispered Scarlett.
'She's very ill - I brought her home.'

1082
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:54,050
Gerald went to the wagon, straightening his
shoulders. 'Cousin Melanie!' he said. 'Twelve

1083
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:55,050
Oaks is burned. You must stay with us.'

1084
01:43:55,050 --> 01:43:56,050
'We must carry her,' said Scarlett. 'She can't
walk.'

1085
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,050
Another person came from the house. It was
Pork, Gerald's personal slave. He ran down

1086
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:58,050
the steps. 'Miss Scarlett!'

1087
01:43:58,050 --> 01:43:59,050
Scarlett caught him by the arms and felt his
tears on her hands as he held them. 'Glad

1088
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:00,050
- glad you're back!' he cried.

1089
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:01,050
It was Pork who carried Melanie indoors. Prissy
took the baby, Wade followed them up the steps

1090
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:02,050
into the house. Scarlett caught her father's
arm before he could follow, too.

1091
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:03,050
'Did they get well, Pa?' she said.

1092
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:04,050
'The girls are getting better,' he said. 'Your
mother-'

1093
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,050
'Yes?'

1094
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,050
'Your mother died yesterday,' said Gerald.

1095
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:07,050
***

1096
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,050
Gerald said it over and over again as he followed
Scarlett around the house. 'She died yesterday

1097
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,050
- she died yesterday.' Scarlett felt nothing
except a great tiredness. She would think

1098
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,050
of Mother later, or she would simply cry and
cry.

1099
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:11,050
Later, when she was alone with her father,
she asked, 'Why didn't the Yankees burn Tara?'

1100
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:12,050
'They used the house for offices,' said Gerald.

1101
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:13,050
'Yankees - in this house?' The thought made
her feel sick.

1102
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:14,050
'They were, daughter,' said Gerald. 'We saw
the smoke from Twelve Oaks before they came.

1103
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:15,050
But Miss Honey and Miss India were in Macon,
so we didn't worry about them. We couldn't

1104
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,050
go to Macon. The girls were so sick - your
mother - we couldn't go. Our negroes ran away.

1105
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:17,050
They stole the wagons and the horses. Only
Mammy, Dilcey and Pork stayed. The Yankees

1106
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:18,050
came up the road from the river and I met
them at the front door.'

1107
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,050
'Oh, brave little Gerald!' thought Scarlett.

1108
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:20,050
'They told me to leave,' went on Gerald. 'They
told me they were going to burn the place.

1109
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:21,050
I told them that we had typhoid in the house
and they would burn it over the heads of three

1110
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:22,050
dying women. The young officer was - was a
gentleman.'

1111
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:23,050
'A Yankee gentleman? Pa!'

1112
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:24,050
'A gentleman,' said Gerald. 'He rode away
and came back with an army doctor who looked

1113
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:25,050
at the girls - and your mother.'

1114
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,050
'You let a Yankee into their room?'

1115
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,050
'He had medicine and we had none. He saved
your sisters,' said Gerald. 'They didn't burn

1116
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:28,050
the house, they moved in. The officers filled
all the rooms except the sick room, and the

1117
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:29,050
soldiers lived in tents around the place.
They killed the cows, the chickens and the

1118
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,050
pigs. They took the pictures and some of the
furniture.'

1119
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:31,050
'And - and Mother? Did she know Yankees were
in the house?'

1120
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:32,050
'She never knew anything.'

1121
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:33,050
'Thank God,' said Scarlett.

1122
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:34,050
'And then they moved on.' He was silent for
a long time and then he held her hand. 'I'm

1123
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:35,050
glad you're home,' he said simply.

1124
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:36,050
***

1125
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,050
After Gerald went to bed, Scarlett went to
the room where Careen and Suellen were sleeping.

1126
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:38,050
Mammy was there, watching them. Her eyes lit
up when she saw Scarlett.

1127
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:39,050
'My child is home!' Mammy said softly. 'Oh,
Miss Scarlett, now that Miss Ellen is dead,

1128
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:40,050
what are we going to do?'

1129
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:41,050
Scarlett sat down next to the bed. 'I want
you to tell me about Mother,' she said, 'I

1130
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,050
just couldn't ask Pa about her.'

1131
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,050
Tears came from Mammy's eyes. 'It was those
Slattery trash that killed Miss Ellen. I told

1132
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:44,050
her and told her not to-'

1133
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:45,050
'Slatterys?' said Scarlett, confused.

1134
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,050
'Emmie Slattery was sick with typhoid and
Miss Ellen went to nurse her,' said Mammy.

1135
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:47,050
'I told her to leave those white trash alone,
but she didn't listen. Then, when Emmie was

1136
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:48,050
getting better, Miss Careen went down with
typhoid, and then Miss Suellen. So Miss Ellen

1137
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:49,050
had to nurse them, too. With all the fighting
up the road, and the Yankees across the river,

1138
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,050
and the field negroes running off every night,
I was nearly crazy with worry. But Miss Ellen

1139
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,050
was cool and calm, except that she worried
because we couldn't get medicines. And then

1140
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:52,050
she went down with typhoid, too.' Mammy dried
her tears before she went on. 'Miss Ellen

1141
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:53,050
went fast, Miss Scarlett. Even that nice Yankee
doctor couldn't do anythin' for her. She died

1142
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:54,050
a few nights after the cotton burned-'

1143
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,050
'Has the cotton gone?' said Scarlett. 'Tell
me!'

1144
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:56,050
'Yes, Miss Scarlett. The Yankees burned it.'

1145
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:57,050
'Three years' cotton!' thought Scarlett. 'One
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, in one

1146
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,050
big fire!'

1147
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,050
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1148
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,050
Murder

1149
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:01,050
Next morning, when Scarlett went down to breakfast,
Gerald was sitting at the table. As Scarlett

1150
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,050
sat down, he said, 'We will wait for Mrs O'Hara.
She is late.'

1151
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:03,050
Scarlett stared at him. He was looking at
her in a strange and confused way, and his

1152
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:04,050
hands were shaking.

1153
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:05,050
'Has Pa lost his mind?' thought Scarlett.
'No! He'll get better. He must get better!

1154
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:06,050
I won't think about it now. I won't think
of him or Mother or any of these awful things!'

1155
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,050
She left the room without eating.

1156
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,050
Pork was outside the house. 'Have you been
over to Twelve Oaks or the Macintosh place

1157
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:09,050
to see if there's anything left in the gardens
that we can eat?' Scarlett asked him.

1158
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:10,050
'No, Miss,' said Pork, 'We ain't left Tara.'

1159
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:11,050
'You go to Macintosh, and I'll go to Twelve
Oaks,' she said.

1160
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:12,050
The road was hot and dusty, but she was hungry,
and they needed food from somewhere. At the

1161
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,050
bottom of the hill was the river, and Scarlett
took off her shoes and put her feet into the

1162
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:14,050
cool water before going on to Twelve Oaks.

1163
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:15,050
It was burned down, and just a few blackened
stones were left of the house where she had

1164
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:16,050
danced and flirted with the men, and dreamed
her dreams of marrying Ashley.

1165
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:17,050
'Oh, Ashley, I hope you are dead!' she thought.
'I don't want you to see this!'

1166
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:18,050
She walked to the garden and found some potatoes
in the soft earth. Without stopping to clean

1167
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,050
it, Scarlett picked up a potato and began
to eat. But it was old and the taste was bitter,

1168
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:20,050
and Scarlett was sick almost immediately.

1169
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:21,050
Then she lay down, her face against the earth,
and thought of the people who were dead, the

1170
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:22,050
way of life that had gone forever, and the
dark and frightening future.

1171
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,050
But the past was the past, Scarlett told herself,
sitting up. Those lazy, happy old days were

1172
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:24,050
gone, never to return. There was no going
back. 'I'm going to live through this,' she

1173
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:25,050
said aloud. 'And when it's over, I'm never
going to be hungry again. If I have to steal

1174
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:26,050
or kill - as God is my witness - I'm never
going to be hungry again!'

1175
01:45:26,050 --> 01:45:27,050
***

1176
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:28,050
After two weeks, she knew that her father
would never get any better. He would always

1177
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:29,050
be waiting for Ellen, always listening for
her. When Scarlett asked him for advice, his

1178
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:30,050
only answer was, 'Do what you think best,
daughter.'

1179
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:31,050
One morning, she was at the open window of
her bedroom. She had hurt her foot and was

1180
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:32,050
sitting in a chair. Melanie was in her room
with the children, Careen and Suellen were

1181
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:33,050
in their room, and Gerald, Mammy, Pork and
Dilcey were in the fields.

1182
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,050
Scarlett was wondering how they were going
to buy food. The only money in the house was

1183
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:35,050
Confederate money, and that had almost no
value now. 'And if I can get my hands on some

1184
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:36,050
money,' she thought, 'how can we carry food
from Jonesboro to Tara?' The old horse that

1185
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:37,050
brought them from Atlanta had died.

1186
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:38,050
It was while she was worrying that she heard
the sound of a horse. She looked up quickly

1187
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:39,050
- and saw a Yankee soldier. He was a rough-looking
man with an untidy black beard - and a gun!

1188
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,050
And he was getting off his horse outside the
front door.

1189
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,050
Scarlett heard him come into the house and
walk through the rooms downstairs. 'In a moment,'

1190
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,050
she thought, 'he'll walk into the kitchen!'
There, cooking over the fire in two large

1191
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,050
pots, were apples and vegetables - brought
painfully from Twelve Oaks and the Macintosh

1192
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:44,050
garden - dinner for nine hungry people, but
only really enough for two. The thought of

1193
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:45,050
the Yankee eating their meal made Scarlett
so angry that she began to shake.

1194
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:46,050
She went to the cupboard and took out the
heavy gun which Charles had never used. Then,

1195
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:47,050
quickly and silently, she ran downstairs,
holding it behind her.

1196
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:48,050
'Who's there?' he shouted. And she stopped
in the middle of the stairs. He was standing

1197
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,050
in the doorway of the dining room, his gun
in one hand. 'So there is somebody home,'

1198
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:50,050
he said, smiling and putting his gun away.
He walked across until he was standing below

1199
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:51,050
her. 'All alone, little lady?' he said.

1200
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:52,050
Before he could move again, Scarlett lifted
her gun and shot him in the face. The noise

1201
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:53,050
filled her ears and the man crashed backwards
on to the floor. Scarlett ran down and stood

1202
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:54,050
over him, looking into what was left of his
face. As she looked, two streams of blood

1203
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:55,050
ran across the floor, one from his face and
one from the back of his head. He was dead.

1204
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:56,050
She had killed a man. 'Murder,' she thought.
'I've done murder. Oh, this can't be happening

1205
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:57,050
to me!'

1206
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,050
A sound behind her made Scarlett turn round.
Melanie, wearing only a night-dress, was coming

1207
01:45:58,050 --> 01:45:59,050
down the stairs. She saw the dead Yankee,
then smiled proudly at Scarlett.

1208
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:00,050
'She - she's like me!' thought Scarlett. 'She
would do the same thing!'

1209
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:01,050
'Scarlett! Scarlett!' cried the frightened
voices of her sisters. Then Wade began to

1210
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:02,050
scream. Melanie climbed back up the stairs
and opened the door of the girls' room.

1211
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:03,050
'Don't be frightened!' she said, laughing.
'Your sister was trying to clean Charles gun,

1212
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:04,050
and it went off and nearly frightened her
to death! Wade, your mother just shot your

1213
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:05,050
dear Pa's gun. When you get older, she'll
let you shoot it, too.'

1214
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:06,050
'What a cool liar!' thought Scarlett. 'I couldn't
think that quickly. But why did she lie? They've

1215
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,050
got to know I've done it.'

1216
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:08,050
Melanie came back downstairs, although she
was weak and in pain. 'Scarlett, we must get

1217
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:09,050
him out of here,' she said. 'He may not be
alone, and if more soldiers come and find

1218
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:10,050
him-'

1219
01:46:10,050 --> 01:46:11,050
'He must be alone,' said Scarlett. 'I didn't
see any others from the upstairs window.'

1220
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:12,050
'Well, no one must know about it,' said Melanie.
'The negroes might talk and then they'll come

1221
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,050
and get you. We must hide him before they
come back.'

1222
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:14,050
'I could dig a hole in the corner of the garden
and put him in it,' said Scarlett. 'But how

1223
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,050
will I get him there?'

1224
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:16,050
'We'll each take a leg and pull him,' said
Melanie.

1225
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,050
'You couldn't pull a cat. You'll kill yourself.'

1226
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:18,050
'All right,' said Melanie. 'You pull him out
and I'll clean up the mess. But can't we go

1227
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:19,050
through his bag and his pockets first? He
might have something to eat.'

1228
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:20,050
Scarlett found a wallet inside his coat. It
was full of money - United States money as

1229
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:21,050
well as Confederate money, and one ten-dollar
gold coin and two five-dollar gold coins.

1230
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,050
Melanie found some coffee in the bag, and
there were rings and other small pieces of

1231
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:23,050
jewellery in his pockets.

1232
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:24,050
'A thief!' whispered Melanie. 'He stole all
this! I'm glad you killed him, Scarlett.'

1233
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:25,050
***

1234
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:26,050
No one asked where the horse came from, they
were just pleased to have him. The Yankee

1235
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,050
lay covered in the hole in the corner of the
garden. No ghost came to frighten Scarlett

1236
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:28,050
during the long nights when she lay awake
afterwards.

1237
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:29,050
'I won't think about it,' she said to herself.

1238
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:30,050
But whenever she had to do something difficult
after this, she thought: 'I've done murder,

1239
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,050
so I can do this.'

1240
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:32,050
CHAPTER TWELVE

1241
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,050
Peace, At Last

1242
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:34,050
By May, 1865, the war was over and the Confederacy
had lost. The dream they had loved and hoped

1243
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,050
for, the Cause which took the lives of their
friends, was finished. But Scarlett cried

1244
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:36,050
no tears. She simply thought: 'Thank God!
Now the cow won't be stolen. Now the horse

1245
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:37,050
is safe. Now I won't be afraid to drive round
the country looking for something to eat.

1246
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:38,050
And if Ashley is alive, he'll be coming home.'

1247
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:39,050
In that warm summer after peace came, a stream
of Confederate soldiers came through Tara,

1248
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:40,050
on their way home. Most were walking, although
a few lucky ones had a horse. They asked each

1249
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:41,050
soldier for news of Ashley, and Suellen asked
about Mr Kennedy, but none of them knew anything.

1250
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:42,050
Then, one afternoon, Uncle Peter surprised
them all by arriving from Atlanta. He came

1251
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:43,050
on an old horse and brought news of Aunt Pitty,
who wanted Melanie and Scarlett to come back

1252
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:44,050
to live with her again.

1253
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:45,050
He also brought a letter - from Ashley.

1254
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:46,050
'He's coming home!' Uncle Peter told them.
'He's alive!'

1255
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:47,050
Melanie fainted, but Scarlett took the letter
and opened it quickly. She recognized Ashley's

1256
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:48,050
writing:

1257
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:49,050
My love, I am coming home to you.

1258
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,050
Tears filled her eyes so that she could not
read any more. Holding the letter, she ran

1259
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:51,050
to her mother's room while the others tried
to help Melanie. She shut the door, then crying

1260
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:52,050
and laughing and kissing the letter, she whispered,
'My love, I am coming home to you!'

1261
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:53,050
***

1262
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,050
When weeks went by and Ashley did not come,
Scarlett began to worry that something had

1263
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:55,050
happened to him along the way.

1264
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:56,050
The never-ending line of soldiers went through,
and Scarlett's heart began to grow hard. They

1265
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:57,050
were eating the food which was meant for the
mouths of Tara. Food was hard to get, and

1266
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:58,050
the money in the Yankee's wallet would not
last forever.

1267
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:59,050
Will Benteen was a soldier who was very ill
when he arrived. One of his legs finished

1268
01:46:59,050 --> 01:47:00,050
at the knee, and a roughly cut wooden leg
was fitted to it. He looked like a poor farmer,

1269
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,050
not a plantation owner, but this did not stop
the girls working to save his life. Then,

1270
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,050
one day, he opened his light blue eyes and
saw Careen sitting beside him.

1271
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,050
'Then you weren't a dream, after all,' he
said.

1272
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:04,050
Will had owned a small farm in Georgia, and
two negroes. He knew that his slaves were

1273
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,050
free now, and that his farm was burned, but
these things did not seem to worry him.

1274
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:06,050
'You've been good to me, Miss Scarlett,' he
said. 'And, if you'll let me, I'm goin' to

1275
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:07,050
stay here and help you with all the work until
I've paid you back. I can't ever pay it all,

1276
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:08,050
because there's no price a man can pay for
his life.'

1277
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:09,050
So he stayed and, slowly and quietly, a large
part of the work and worry of Tara, passed

1278
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:10,050
from Scarlett to him.

1279
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:11,050
***

1280
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:12,050
It was a warm September afternoon, and Will
was sitting on the front steps of Tara, talking

1281
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:13,050
to Scarlett. Melanie came out to join them.
Although she did her share of the work at

1282
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:14,050
Tara, she was thin and never completely well.

1283
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:15,050
Will was talking about his trip to Fayetteville
that morning when he looked along the road

1284
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:16,050
leading to Tara.

1285
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,050
'Another soldier,' he said.

1286
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:18,050
Scarlett looked and saw a man with a beard,
wearing the usual grey and blue uniform which

1287
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:19,050
was dusty and torn.

1288
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,050
'I hope he isn't very hungry,' she said.

1289
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:21,050
'He'll be hungry,' said Will.

1290
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,050
Melanie stood up. 'I'll tell Dilcey to-'

1291
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:23,050
She stopped so suddenly that Scarlett turned
to look at her. Melanie's hand was at her

1292
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:24,050
throat and her face was white. 'She's going
to faint,' thought Scarlett, jumping to her

1293
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:25,050
feet.

1294
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:26,050
But Melanie was running down the steps, her
arms stretching out towards the soldier. And

1295
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:27,050
then Scarlett knew the truth.

1296
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:28,050
The man lifted his face and looked towards
the house, as if he was too tired to take

1297
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,050
another step. Melanie, crying out, threw herself
into his arms.

1298
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,050
Scarlett took two steps forward, but Will
stopped her.

1299
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:31,050
'Don't spoil it,' he said quietly.

1300
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:32,050
'Let me go, you fool! Let me go! It's Ashley!'

1301
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:33,050
Will held her. 'He's her husband, ain't he?'
he said calmly.

1302
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,050
Scarlett looked at him angrily - and in the
quiet kindness of his eyes she saw understanding

1303
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:35,050
and pity.

1304
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:35,052
- THE END -
