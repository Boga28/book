00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,200
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,550
Failure and Success

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,420
The older Monsieur Bovary, Monsieur Charles
Denis Bartholome Bovary, had been a good-looking

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,090
man when younger, with a big moustache and
rings on his fingers.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,619
He was not, however, an impressive man, and
although he wore expensive clothes, he always

6
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,550
looked like an uncomfortable mixture of a
military man and a cheap shopkeeper.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,841
His good looks and ability to sell himself
did, nevertheless, win him a wife with a good

8
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:36,930
income.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,210
After he was safely married, he lived for
two or three years on her money.

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,219
He ate and drank well, and spent his days
lying in bed till midday, smoking his pipe

11
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,110
and never coming home till the theatres and
cafes closed.

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:00,289
When his father-in-law died, the old man left
very little money to his daughter.

13
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:07,259
Disappointed, Monsieur Bovary tried to start
a textile business, but lost a lot of money

14
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:12,799
and finally retired into the country with
the idea of showing the people there how to

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,369
run a farm.

16
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,229
However, he knew as little about agriculture
as he did about textiles.

17
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:25,869
He rode his horses instead of making them
work, ate the fattest chickens instead of

18
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,459
selling them, and cleaned his shooting-boots
with his own best bacon-fat.

19
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:38,459
He soon discovered that he had little chance
of making a fortune.

20
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,259
Around this time he found a place on the borders
of Caux and Picardy, half farm, half private

21
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,130
house, which he could rent for two hundred
francs a year.

22
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:56,119
He took it and there, an angry, disappointed
man, at war with the rest of the world, he

23
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,229
shut himself up at the age of forty-five.

24
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,429
He said that he was disgusted with other people
and wanted only to live by himself.

25
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:13,819
At the beginning, his wife had loved him above
all others, but this only seemed to add to

26
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,140
his dislike of the world and he never had
a kind word for her.

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,120
She had been cheerful, kind-hearted and friendly,
but as she grew older, in the same way that

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,400
good wine turns into vinegar, she became bad-tempered
and bad company.

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,129
She was a hard worker, though, unlike her
husband.

30
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:40,849
She was always on her feet, always busy, hurrying
to see the lawyers, knowing exactly when the

31
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,049
next bills had to be paid.

32
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,750
Indoors she was always working: sewing, washing,
keeping an eye on the men and paying them

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,750
their wages.

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,501
Her lord and master, paying no attention to
what was going on around him, sat smoking

35
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,129
by the fire.

36
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:03,330
When the first Madame Bovary had a child,
it became the centre of her world.

37
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,519
The child's father, however, would have been
happy to let him go without shoes.

38
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,599
He said that it would be more natural not
to give him clothes and to let him run around

39
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,670
like a young animal.

40
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,900
In contrast to his wife's ideas, he thought
a boy would grow up to be a better man if

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,550
he undressed in the cold, learned to drink
alcohol and laughed at the village priest.

42
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:33,829
The child, a gentle little thing, made little
progress in this kind of education.

43
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,420
His mother always kept him close to her; she
cut out pictures for him from the newspaper

44
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,830
and made up countless stories.

45
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,860
In loving her son, she was looking for something
to make up for the loneliness of her life.

46
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,329
She dreamed he would be famous.

47
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:57,069
She could see him as a tall, handsome, clever
man, high up in the government service.

48
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:02,849
She taught him to read, and to sing - while
she played on her old piano.

49
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,290
Monsieur Bovary said this was all a waste
of time.

50
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,550
How were they ever going to afford to educate
him for a government job, or help him start

51
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,019
in business?

52
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,639
Madame Bovary bit her lip and did not argue
with her husband, and the child was allowed

53
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,720
to run wild in the village.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,030
He went around with the farm workers, scared
the birds by throwing stones at them, looked

55
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:35,490
for wild fruit, helped in the fields, wandered
through the woods and played with other children.

56
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,000
On Saints' days, he helped ring the bells
in the church, and he loved to hang on to

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,440
the big rope and feel himself carried up as
it rose in the air.

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,530
And he grew as strong as a young oak tree,
with big hands and red cheeks.

59
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,639
When he reached the age of twelve, his mother
managed to arrange for him to begin his studies

60
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,690
with the priest, but the lessons were so short
and badly organized that they did not do him

61
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,090
much good.

62
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,380
Sometimes it would be hot and the child would
grow tired, and before long the old man would

63
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,280
be sleeping with his mouth wide open.

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,120
At other times the priest would see Charles
playing with his friends and would call him

65
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,410
over to test his Latin verbs.

66
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,310
But then, perhaps, it would begin to rain,
or someone they knew would come along, and

67
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,280
lessons would be over for that day.

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,349
The priest always had a good word for his
pupil, though, and said that the young man

69
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,389
had a very good memory.

70
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,660
By the time young Charles was thirteen, even
his father saw that something must be done,

71
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,720
and Charles left his unhappy home to spend
three unhappy years in the College at Rouen.

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,560
He wrote to his mother every week; he did
his homework.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,250
He never did very well in his studies, but
he never failed altogether.

74
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,940
At the end of three years, his mother took
him away from the College, with the plan that

75
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,449
he should study medicine.

76
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:11,680
She got him a room on the fourth floor of
a house overlooking a little river.

77
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,650
She made arrangements for his meals, found
some bits of furniture - a table and a couple

78
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,190
of chairs and an old bed - and made sure there
was plenty of firewood to keep her poor boy

79
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,290
warm.

80
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,650
After a week of preparations she went back
home, asking him over and over again to look

81
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,409
after himself and to study hard.

82
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:39,060
The list of lectures which he read at the
beginning of the term made his head spin.

83
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,370
There were lectures on subjects he had never
heard of, with names he could not even pronounce.

84
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,470
He listened as hard as he could, but he could
not understand what the lecturers were talking

85
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,610
about.

86
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,509
However, he attended every lecture and filled
notebook after notebook.

87
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,389
He got through his work like a horse that
is used to turn a mill-wheel, going round

88
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,889
and round in the same place with his eyes
covered, never knowing what he was doing or

89
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:10,280
where he was going.

90
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,870
Charles failed his medical examinations the
first time - the course was too difficult

91
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,870
for him.

92
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,730
But his mother still believed in him, and
made his father pay for one more year.

93
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:28,470
This time Charles managed to pass and his
mother began to plan again.

94
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,629
First he must have somewhere to work, and
then he must have a wife.

95
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:41,189
The first problem was solved when the old
doctor in Tostes, a small town near Rouen,

96
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:42,229
died.

97
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,169
Charles became the next doctor.

98
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,969
Then his mother found a 45-year-old widow
in Dieppe, with an income of twelve hundred

99
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:53,050
francs a year.

100
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,069
Though she was ugly and bad-tempered (and
twenty-five years older than Charles), her

101
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:05,300
income made her attractive and Charles thought
the marriage would make his life better.

102
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,520
He thought he would now have freedom and money
to spend.

103
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,550
He was wrong.

104
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,340
His wife was in charge.

105
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,729
She told him what to say, and what not to
say.

106
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:22,360
She opened his letters, watched his movements
and, when women patients were in the surgery,

107
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,240
she listened from the next room.

108
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,080
At night, when Charles came to bed, she put
her long bony arms round his neck and told

109
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,700
him all her troubles.

110
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,530
He did not love her, he loved someone else.

111
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,030
Yes, she knew she would always be unhappy.

112
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:47,020
And she always ended by asking him for some
medicine - and for a little more love.

113
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,760
CHAPTER TWO
Mademoiselle Emma

114
00:08:51,760 --> 00:09:00,680
One night, Charles received a letter asking
him to come at once to a farm at Les Bertaux

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,830
where the farmer had broken his leg.

116
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,070
The night was dark and the farm was twenty-five
kilometres away, but the farmer was a rich

117
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,370
man and Charles was still building up his
business.

118
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,180
So at four o'clock in the morning, Dr Bovary
set out.

119
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,710
A child was waiting at an open gate as he
approached the farm.

120
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,200
'Are you the doctor?' he asked.

121
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,800
As Charles rode along, he learned from the
boy that Monsieur Rouault had broken his leg

122
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
the night before.

123
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,970
He also learned that he had lost his wife
two years ago, and had no one with him now

124
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,260
except for his daughter, who looked after
the house for him.

125
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,400
Mademoiselle Emma, the farmer's daughter,
came to the door and showed him into the kitchen.

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,030
A fire was burning and the men's dinner was
cooking in big polished pans.

127
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,320
Charles went upstairs to see the farmer.

128
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,990
The broken leg was a simple problem and Charles
asked the servant and the young woman to help

129
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,400
with the patient.

130
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,380
As they tied up the farmer's leg, Charles
was surprised to see how white her nails were.

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,700
Her hands, however, were not beautiful - perhaps
a little too red.

132
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,740
She herself was too tall, and she did not
have the kind of soft figure Charles liked.

133
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,450
Her good point was her eyes.

134
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,530
They were dark, almost black, and she looked
at you honestly and fearlessly.

135
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,630
As soon as he had finished looking after his
patient, the doctor was invited by Monsieur

136
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,060
Rouault to eat before he left.

137
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,660
Charles went down into the room below, where
two places had been laid with shining silver

138
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,510
on a small table and Mademoiselle Emma was
waiting for him.

139
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,850
A smell of flowers and clean clothes came
from a cupboard opposite the window and on

140
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,610
the floor, in the corner, stood a few bags
of wheat.

141
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,260
Someone had hung a drawing of a Greek god
in the middle of one of the walls.

142
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:14,550
It was in an attractive frame, and written
at the bottom were the words 'To my dear Father'.

143
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:21,070
They began by talking about Monsieur Rouault,
and went on to discuss the weather and the

144
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,690
cold winter.

145
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,630
Mademoiselle Emma did not like the country
very much, especially now she had almost all

146
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,360
the responsibility of the farm on her shoulders.

147
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,030
When Charles, who had been upstairs to say
goodbye to the farmer, came back into the

148
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,740
dining room, he found her standing by the
window looking out into the garden.

149
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,070
She turned round.

150
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,610
'Are you looking for something?'

151
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,700
she asked.

152
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,040
'Yes, I'm trying to find my riding-whip,'
he replied, and he began to look behind the

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,750
doors and under the chairs.

154
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,110
Mademoiselle Emma found it between the bags
of wheat and the wall, and Charles went over

155
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,190
to help.

156
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,740
As he bent down, he felt the young woman's
back rubbing against his chest.

157
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:21,160
She stood up, blushing, and, looking at him
over her shoulder, handed him his whip.

158
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,060
Instead of going back to Les Bertaux three
days later, as he said he would, he returned

159
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,930
the next day, and he then went to the farm
twice a week.

160
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,420
After forty-six days, Monsieur Rouault could
move around without help, and people began

161
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,160
to say what an excellent doctor Monsieur Bovary
was.

162
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,060
Pere Rouault said the very best doctors in
Yvetot or Rouen itself could not have treated

163
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,720
him better.

164
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,550
Charles did not ask himself why he liked going
to Les Bertaux.

165
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,170
If he had thought about it he would have said
to himself that it was a serious case, or

166
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,700
he expected to earn a good fee.

167
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,910
But was that really the reason why these visits
to the farm were so pleasant?

168
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,670
On days when he was visiting, he got up early
and rode to the farm as quickly as he could,

169
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,170
only stopping to clean his boots and to put
on his black gloves before going into the

170
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,300
house.

171
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:25,510
He liked to ride into the yard, and see the
farm boys as they came forward to meet him.

172
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:31,160
He liked the house, and Monsieur Rouault,
who held his hand and said he had saved his

173
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,850
life; he liked the sound of Mademoiselle Emma's
wooden shoes on the clean stone floor of the

174
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,850
kitchen.

175
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,990
When he left, she always came with him to
the top of the steps, and would wait with

176
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,690
him until the boys brought his horse.

177
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,390
One day, at the end of the winter, it started
to rain as he was leaving the house.

178
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,110
She went back inside for an umbrella and put
it up.

179
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,450
It was a silk one, and it caught the sunlight,
reflecting little coloured patches of light

180
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,890
on to the whiteness of her skin.

181
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,680
She smiled at him, and you could hear the
sound of the rain drops as they fell, one

182
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,610
by one, on to the tight surface of the silk.

183
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:22,240
When Charles first began his visits to Les
Bertaux, his wife always asked about his patient.

184
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,180
But when she learned that the farmer's daughter
had been to school and had learned dancing,

185
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:35,580
geography and drawing, and could play the
piano, her interest changed to anger and dislike.

186
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,810
At first she made unfriendly remarks about
Mademoiselle Rouault, but Charles ignored

187
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,820
them because he did not want an argument.

188
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,110
So at last she told him to his face what she
thought of him, and he did not know what to

189
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,110
reply.

190
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,980
Why did he keep going to Les Bertaux?

191
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,060
Monsieur Rouault was well again now and he
had not paid his bill.

192
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,670
Ah, she knew all about it!

193
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,800
There was someone else there, someone who
was a good talker, someone who was well educated

194
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,830
and clever.

195
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,910
That was what he liked - young, pretty ladies!

196
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:16,590
So Charles agreed to stop his visits to Les
Bertaux, but now that he could not see Mademoiselle

197
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,120
Emma he decided he could love her.

198
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,240
His wife was so unattractive, just skin and
bone.

199
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,000
She wore the same black clothes and gray stockings,
the same ugly shoes all year round.

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,230
So if he could not see the farmer's daughter
any more, he would dream of her!

201
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:44,360
This unhappy situation lasted for several
months until, one fine day in the early spring,

202
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:52,350
the lawyer who had looked after Madame Bovary's
affairs left town with all his clients' money.

203
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:58,260
She still had a share in a ship that was worth
six thousand francs, and her house in Dieppe,

204
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,570
but there was nothing left of that fortune
she had been so proud of.

205
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,800
And when her financial affairs were looked
into more carefully, Charles's father found

206
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,880
out that the house in Dieppe was mortgaged
and her share in the vessel was not worth

207
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,850
more than two hundred francs.

208
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,370
She had lied, the good lady!

209
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,250
Monsieur Bovary senior was so angry that he
took up a chair and smashed it on the stone

210
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:32,100
floor, and he told his wife she had ruined
her son by making him marry an old woman like

211
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
that.

212
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,240
They came to Tostes to tell Charles's rich
wife what they thought of her.

213
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,370
There was a terrible argument.

214
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,300
Heloise begged her husband to defend her against
his parents, and Charles did his best, but

215
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,080
the old people were still angry when they
left the house.

216
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,030
The damage had been done.

217
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:59,320
A week later, as she was hanging out the washing
in the yard, Heloise Bovary found that she

218
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,830
was spitting blood.

219
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,360
The next day, while Charles had his back to
her, opening the curtains, she cried out,

220
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,339
'Oh God!' and fell to the floor.

221
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,250
She was dead!

222
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,309
How amazing!

223
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,209
When the funeral was over, Charles returned
to the house.

224
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:26,259
He went up into the bedroom and saw her dress
hanging up at the foot of the bed.

225
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:32,049
He stayed there until it was dark, lost in
sorrowful thought.

226
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:38,570
After all, perhaps she had loved him.

227
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,950
CHAPTER THREE
A New Wife

228
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,330
One morning Pere Rouault came to pay Charles
for his treatment, and to say how sorry he

229
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,679
was to hear about his wife's death.

230
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,799
Seeing how unhappy Charles looked, he said,
'You must make an effort, Monsieur Bovary;

231
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,919
you will be happy again one day.

232
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,970
Come and see us.

233
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,240
My daughter asks about you and says that you
are forgetting her.

234
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,610
Spring will soon be here.

235
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,899
Come and shoot a rabbit or two!'

236
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,250
Charles took his advice.

237
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,841
He went back to Les Bertaux, and found everything
there just the same as before.

238
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:26,480
The apple trees were already in flower, and
Pere Rouault did his best to make the doctor

239
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,380
feel comfortable.

240
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,320
He even told him a few stories, and Charles
was surprised to find himself laughing.

241
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,899
When he remembered his wife he became serious
again, but then the coffee came in and he

242
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,799
thought no more about her.

243
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:47,510
Back home, he also thought of her less and
less as he got used to living alone.

244
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,850
He was free now to have his meals when he
liked, he could go out and come in without

245
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,289
having to give explanations, and when he was
very tired he could stretch out his arms and

246
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,860
legs in bed as far as he liked.

247
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:09,090
He gave himself little treats, let himself
feel self-pity and let people be nice to him.

248
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,120
Moreover, his wife's death had been rather
good for him professionally because, for a

249
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,000
whole month, people had been saying, 'Poor
young man!

250
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
What bad luck!'

251
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,860
So his name had been heard and his practice
had increased and he could go to Les Bertaux

252
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,250
whenever he wanted to.

253
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,340
He was strangely happy and, looking at himself
in the mirror as he brushed his moustache,

254
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,590
he thought he had become better-looking.

255
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,000
He arrived at the farm one day at about three
o'clock when everyone was out in the fields.

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,090
He went into the kitchen, but did not see
Emma at first.

257
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,809
The sunlight shone on the kitchen floor in
long narrow bars, reflecting on the ceiling.

258
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:00,929
Flies on the table crawled up the glasses
that had not been washed, or drowned in the

259
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:03,620
cider in the bottom of a jug.

260
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,289
Between the window and the fireplace Emma
sat sewing.

261
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:15,730
She had no scarf around her neck, and he could
see the fine hairs on her shoulders.

262
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,809
Like all country people, she offered him a
drink.

263
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:27,190
He said no at first, but at last, with a laugh,
she persuaded him to have a glass with her.

264
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,279
She went to the cupboard and brought out the
bottle, took down two small glasses, filled

265
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:38,320
one, poured two or three drops into the other
and, tapping it against the doctor's, put

266
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,730
it to her lips.

267
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:46,749
As it was nearly empty, she leaned back to
drink and, with her head back, she began to

268
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:49,299
laugh because she could not taste anything.

269
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:54,200
At the same time, she tried to catch some
of the drops from the bottom of the glass

270
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,549
with the tip of her tongue.

271
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:05,059
Then she sat down and took up her work again
- a white cotton sock which she was repairing.

272
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,740
She worked with her head bent forward.

273
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,539
She did not talk, nor did Charles.

274
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:15,350
As he watched her, the only sound he could
hear was the excitement of a hen that had

275
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,970
laid an egg in the yard outside.

276
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,190
After some time, Emma started to talk to him.

277
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,769
She had been complaining ever since the spring
about feeling dizzy; she wondered whether

278
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,190
bathing in the sea would do her any good.

279
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,000
She began to talk about her convent school,
and Charles about his college days.

280
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,610
They went upstairs to her room, where she
showed him her old music books and the prizes

281
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,490
she had won.

282
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,600
And she went on to speak of her mother, and
even pointed out the bed in the garden where

283
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,490
she gathered flowers on the first Friday in
every month, to lay on her mothers grave.

284
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,899
She said she would like to live in town in
the winter, although perhaps the long days

285
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:06,029
made the country even more boring in the summer;
and according to what she was saying, her

286
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:13,649
voice was clear and strong, musical or almost
a whisper, as if she were speaking to herself.

287
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:21,130
That night, as he was riding home, Charles
thought about the different things she had

288
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,159
said, trying to remember them exactly to discover
what they meant, so that he might understand

289
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,509
how her life had been before he met her.

290
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:38,210
Then he began to wonder how she would become
if she married - and whom she would marry.

291
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:44,909
Unfortunately, old Rouault was apparently
very wealthy, and she herself...

292
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,190
so beautiful!

293
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,249
But the thought kept coming to him: 'The doctor
wants a wife.

294
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:55,880
Yes, the doctor wants a wife.'

295
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,520
That night he could not sleep.

296
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,980
He got up, took a drink from the water-jug
and opened his window.

297
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:12,240
The sky was filled with stars, a warm breeze
was blowing and, a long way off, some dogs

298
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
were barking.

299
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,760
He turned his head towards Les Bertaux.

300
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,980
Thinking that, after all, he had nothing to
lose by it, Charles made up his mind to ask

301
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,110
her to marry him.

302
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,190
But every time he was alone with her, the
fear of being unable to find the right words

303
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,549
left him unable to speak.

304
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:38,440
In fact Pere Rouault would have been happy
to see his daughter married, especially as

305
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,480
she was very little use in the house.

306
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,299
He made excuses for her, telling himself that
she had too much intelligence for the farming

307
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,299
life.

308
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,720
When, therefore, he noticed that Charles blushed
each time he was near his daughter, and that

309
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,620
the young man was clearly interested in her,
he gave the matter some thought.

310
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,070
Although Charles was not the sort of man he
would have chosen for a son-in-law, he was

311
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,049
well educated and a hard worker, and would
not ask him for too much money to take his

312
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,960
daughter off his hands.

313
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,009
This mattered, as Monsieur Rouault had debts
with most of his suppliers and had just had

314
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:18,389
to sell a large amount of land.

315
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:24,090
'If he asks me,' he said to himself, 'he can
have her.'

316
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:31,210
A little later, Charles came to spend three
days at Les Bertaux.

317
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:37,049
The time went quickly, and he never seemed
to find the right moment to speak.

318
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,159
As he was leaving, Monsieur Rouault came out
to see him on his way.

319
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,630
They had reached a bend in the road and were
preparing to say goodbye.

320
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,559
It was now or never.

321
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,429
Charles gave himself until the corner of the
field and at last, when they had passed it,

322
00:24:53,429 --> 00:25:00,470
he said, almost in a whisper, 'Monsieur Rouault,
there is something I want to say to you.'

323
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,389
They stopped.

324
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:06,379
Charles could not speak.

325
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,400
'Come on then, out with it!

326
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,919
Do you think I don't know what it's all about?'
said the farmer, laughing quietly.

327
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:17,360
'Pere Rouault...

328
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,799
Pere Rouault...'

329
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,679
'Well,' the farmer went on, 'there's nothing
I would like better.

330
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:32,869
But, though I am sure my little girl will
agree, we must put the question to her.

331
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,529
You go on; I'll go back to the farm.

332
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:39,470
If it's yes, there'll be no need for you to
come back...

333
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,850
She'll need some time to get used to the idea!

334
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,919
But so you can be sure, I'll open the window
in the front bedroom.

335
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,009
You'll be able to see it from the back here.'

336
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,440
And with these words he returned to the house.

337
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,809
Charles tied his horse to a tree.

338
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,220
He hurried back to take up his position, and
waited.

339
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:10,730
Half an hour went by, then nineteen more minutes,
which he timed by his watch.

340
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,440
Suddenly something banged against the wall.

341
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,720
The window was open.

342
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,630
She had accepted him!

343
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,740
Next day, by nine o'clock, he was at the farm.

344
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,830
Emma blushed when he came in, but tried to
laugh a little, too.

345
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,519
Pere Rouault took his son-in-law in his arms.

346
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,360
Then they began to talk about the arrangements.

347
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,009
They had plenty of time before them, since
the wedding could not take place until at

348
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:44,580
least twelve months after the death of Charles's
first wife, and that meant the spring of the

349
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,220
following year.

350
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,820
The wedding dinner was a grand affair.

351
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,970
Forty-three people sat down at the table and
remained there for sixteen hours, and the

352
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,289
party which followed went on for several days.

353
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:04,900
For most of the guests it was a wedding to
remember.

354
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,519
The only person who did not enter the spirit
of things seemed to be Madame Bovary senior,

355
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,029
who sat through the whole event with a sour
look on her face.

356
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:22,090
No one had asked her about the bride's dress,
or the arrangements for the party.

357
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,159
She went to bed early.

358
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,950
Her husband, however, did not follow her,
but sent into Saint-Victor for cigars.

359
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:37,370
He sat with the men and smoked until the morning,
drinking and laughing until the sun rose.

360
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:44,090
On the day of the wedding, Charles had not
been a great success; he was neither a confident

361
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,549
speaker nor a great teller of jokes.

362
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:51,499
Next day, however, he seemed a different man.

363
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:57,230
While Emma did not give the smallest idea
of what she thought about it all, Charles

364
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,450
was completely changed.

365
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:06,350
He called her his wife, his dear, kept asking
where she was, looked for her everywhere and

366
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:11,820
frequently took her out into the yard, where
he was seen among the trees with his arm round

367
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,489
her waist.

368
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:18,780
Two days after the wedding, the newly married
couple left.

369
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,239
Charles could not be away from his practice
any longer.

370
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:29,450
Monsieur Rouault sent them home in his carriage,
and went with them himself as far as Vassonville.

371
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:35,610
There he kissed his daughter goodbye, and
started for home again on foot.

372
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,379
When he had gone about a hundred metres he
stopped and looked back at the carriage disappearing

373
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:41,940
down the road.

374
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,110
Then he thought of his own wedding.

375
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,769
Like Charles, he, too, had been happy when
he took his wife from her father's house,

376
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,070
back to his own.

377
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,580
She had ridden behind him through the snow;
it was near Christmas and the country all

378
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,450
white.

379
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,750
One of her arms held on to him, and over the
other she carried her basket.

380
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:09,259
When he turned his head he saw close by him,
just above his shoulder, her little smiling

381
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,320
face.

382
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,559
To warm her fingers she had pushed them, from
time to time, inside his jacket.

383
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,860
How far away it seemed now.

384
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,120
He looked back again, and there was nothing
to be seen along the road.

385
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,299
He felt as sad as an empty house.

386
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:36,120
Monsieur and Madame Charles arrived at Tostes
at about six o'clock.

387
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,020
The neighbours came to their windows to take
a look at the doctor's new wife.

388
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,739
The old servant came to meet them and made
excuses for the dinner not being ready, and

389
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:54,789
suggested that, for the moment, Madame should
come in and look around the house.

390
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,650
CHAPTER FOUR
Two Worlds

391
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,179
The front of the house looked straight on
to the street.

392
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:08,480
Hanging up behind the front door were the
doctor's coat, a belt, a black leather cap

393
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,220
and, on the floor in the corner, a pair of
boots covered with dried mud.

394
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,030
To the right was the sitting room, where meals
were also eaten.

395
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:24,830
White cotton curtains with a red border were
hung along the windows, and above the fireplace

396
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,490
there was a splendid clock and a head of Hippocrates.

397
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,919
On the other side of the passage was Charles's
consulting room, a little box of a place about

398
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,170
two metres wide with a table, three ordinary
chairs and one armchair.

399
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:45,989
A set of books, the Dictionary of Medical
Science, took up almost all the six shelves

400
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:52,289
of the bookcase; they had been owned by many
earlier doctors in Tostes, but never read.

401
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:58,029
The smell of cooking would come in through
the thin wall during consultations, and anyone

402
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:03,130
in the kitchen could hear the patients coughing
and talking to the doctor as clearly as if

403
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,809
they were in the room.

404
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:10,289
The long, narrow garden ran down to the fields.

405
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:15,720
Fruit trees grew along the stone walls and
four flower beds, planted with weak-looking

406
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,279
roses, were set around a square area which
was used for vegetables.

407
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,690
At the far end, under some low trees, there
was a small white statue of a priest reading

408
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,419
a prayer book.

409
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,859
Emma went up to see the bedrooms.

410
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:38,100
There was no furniture in the first one but
the second, their bedroom, contained their

411
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,989
new bed with its red curtains.

412
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:47,960
There was a box made of seashells on a chest
of drawers and on the desk, by the window,

413
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,749
stood a glass bottle with a bunch of dried
flowers tied with white ribbon.

414
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:58,529
They were the flowers from his first wife's
wedding.

415
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,929
Charles saw her looking at them, and took
them out of the room.

416
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:08,249
Sitting in an armchair, while her maid unpacked
her things, Emma thought about her own wedding

417
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:13,350
flowers, lying in one of the boxes, and she
wondered what would happen to them if she

418
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,759
died young.

419
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,130
Charles was a happy man now.

420
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,629
In bed in the morning, with her head on the
pillow beside him, he would look at the sunlight

421
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,340
on her cheek and at her beautiful eyes when
she woke.

422
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:34,929
He could lose himself in those eyes, looking
into them until he saw a tiny picture of himself,

423
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:39,690
his nightcap on his head and the collar of
his shirt open.

424
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:45,109
As soon as he was up and dressed, she would
go to the window to see him start his day.

425
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:50,100
Down in the street below, Charles would prepare
to get on to his horse while she went on talking

426
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,790
to him from above.

427
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,090
Sometimes she might find a feather and send
it floating through the air to be caught in

428
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,679
the long hair on his old white horse's neck.

429
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:07,340
As he rode off, Charles would blow her a kiss
and she would wave back to him.

430
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,999
It was the first time in his life that he
had tasted such happiness.

431
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:16,570
He had been lonely and friendless at school
and when he was studying medicine.

432
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:22,330
And then he had had fourteen months of married
life with the widow, whose feet, in bed, were

433
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,779
like lumps of ice.

434
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:29,350
But now this lovely woman was his for life!

435
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:35,559
Before she married, Emma too had thought she
was in love, but the happiness that should

436
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:39,049
have come from love was somehow missing.

437
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:45,169
It seemed to her that she must have made a
mistake, must have misunderstood things in

438
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,330
one way or another.

439
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:53,379
And as she stood by her bedroom window, morning
after morning, Emma tried hard to understand

440
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:58,289
what, exactly, the words joy, love, desire
meant.

441
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:07,330
They had always seemed so beautiful to her
in books, but what did they mean in real life?

442
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,120
Novels had always seemed more real to her
than the life she had to live.

443
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,830
When she was at her convent school, a teacher
sometimes secretly lent such books to the

444
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,830
older girls.

445
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:23,810
They were all about love, lovers, beautiful
girls, ladies in danger, horses ridden till

446
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:31,560
they dropped dead, dark forests, tears and
kisses, and gentlemen as brave as lions.

447
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,820
When she was fifteen, Emma read the works
of Walter Scott for the first time and found

448
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,120
she was happier in this imagined past than
her rather boring present; the characters

449
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,190
she read about in these books were much more
interesting than the teachers and students

450
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,630
she saw around her.

451
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:56,600
She had felt a thrill each time she blew back
the thin paper which protected the pictures.

452
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:03,160
She saw young men holding young women in white
dresses in their arms, or English ladies with

453
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,080
golden hair, who looked at you with big, bright
eyes.

454
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:14,200
In her reading she was able to listen to the
sound of heavenly music and of falling leaves.

455
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,090
Later, after her mother died, she even fell
in love with the church and thought of staying

456
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,220
in the convent, of never going out into the
world.

457
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,680
But in her last year of school, she began
to lose her interest in religion.

458
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,110
When her father took her away, her teachers
were not sorry to see her go.

459
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:40,570
She had, they thought, stopped showing any
respect for their community.

460
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:46,220
On her return home, Emma tried to find an
interest in managing her father's house, but

461
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,040
she soon grew tired of the country and wished
herself back in her convent.

462
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,090
When Charles came to Les Bertaux for the first
time, she thought of herself as a disappointed

463
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:05,340
woman, one for whom life had nothing new to
offer, either in knowledge or experience.

464
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,310
Maybe her wish for a change - possibly, too,
the unrest caused by the presence of an unknown

465
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,370
man - had been enough to make her believe
that she was at last in love.

466
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:24,370
But now she could not believe that her present
state was the happiness she had dreamed about.

467
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:31,780
Nevertheless, she sometimes thought that these
were, in fact, the happiest days of her life.

468
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,920
Of course, it would have been so much better
if they could have gone far away to lands

469
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,500
whose names fall like music on the ear, where
the weddings of lovers are followed by mornings

470
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,910
of soft delight and where, when the sun goes
down, you breathe, sitting beside the sea,

471
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,790
the sweet perfume of the lemon trees.

472
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,320
Why did her bedroom window not look out on
to the Swiss or Scottish mountains?

473
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,400
Why did her husband not stand beside her in
a black silk jacket, the wind blowing his

474
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,860
long hair back from his pale, white forehead?

475
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:13,150
But Charles could not read these thoughts,
and was not able to share her dreams, and

476
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,730
as their lives became closer Emma, in fact,
began to have a secret feeling of distance

477
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,370
from her husband.

478
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,290
Charles's conversation was uninteresting to
her.

479
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:29,780
He told her that when he lived in Rouen he
never had the smallest desire to go to the

480
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,780
theatre.

481
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,750
He could not swim, he had no idea of how to
use a sword, he could not fire a gun.

482
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,570
He knew nothing, and he wanted nothing.

483
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:48,980
He thought she was happy, and his heavy, comfortable
happiness had begun to annoy her.

484
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,050
A few weeks after they came to Tostes, one
of Charles's patients presented Madame with

485
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,130
a little Italian hunting dog.

486
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,270
She took it with her for walks, because she
used to go out sometimes just to get a few

487
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:07,500
moments to herself and to enjoy a change from
the garden and the dusty road.

488
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,430
She would go as far as the woods near Banneville,
along by the empty summer house at the end

489
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,650
of the wall, towards the open country.

490
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:21,780
There, at the side of the lake, the plants
grew higher than a man and had leaves as sharp

491
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,900
as knives.

492
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,130
Sitting at the edge of the wood among the
pink and blue wild flowers, her thoughts would

493
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:33,040
wander here and there, like her dog, which
ran from one place to the next chasing the

494
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
birds and insects.

495
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,020
But in the same way that her dog always came
back to her, she always came back to the same

496
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:47,590
question: 'My God, why did I marry him?'

497
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:53,500
She would then call Djali (the name she had
given her dog) to come to her and, stroking

498
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:01,240
her long, graceful head, would say, 'Come,
kiss your mistress; you have no worries, have

499
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
you?'

500
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,730
Then she would look into the creature's beautiful,
sad eyes, and a feeling of tenderness would

501
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,290
come over her.

502
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:15,240
Pretending the animal was herself, she would
talk to her aloud as if she were comforting

503
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,540
someone.

504
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:22,810
Towards the end of September, however, an
extraordinary event happened in her life:

505
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:28,990
she was invited to La Vaubyessard, the home
of the Marquis d'Andervilliers.

506
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,060
The Marquis, who had been a Minister in the
national government, wanted to get back into

507
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,980
politics, and he was now doing his best to
make himself popular.

508
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,190
During the winter months he had given firewood
to the poor, and he was always the first to

509
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,790
demand new roads for his district.

510
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:51,560
During the summer, he had had a painful mouth
infection, which Charles had managed to cure

511
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,980
before it became really serious.

512
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,730
The servant who was sent to Tostes to pay
for the treatment told his master, when he

513
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,690
got back, that he had seen some splendid cherries
in the doctor's little garden.

514
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:10,180
Cherries did not grow well at La Vaubyessard,
and the Marquis asked Bovary to let him have

515
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,680
a few baskets.

516
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,500
He then decided to come in person to thank
the doctor, saw Emma, and noted that she had

517
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,770
a pretty figure and good manners.

518
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:26,470
After this, the Marquis decided that he would
not harm his chances in the coming vote if

519
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,890
he sent the young people an invitation to
his house.

520
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,600
And so, one Wednesday at three o'clock, Monsieur
and Madame Bovary set off in their carriage

521
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,790
to La Vaubyessard, with a big travelling bag
tied on behind, and a hatbox fixed in front.

522
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:48,600
They arrived when it was getting dark, just
as the lamps were being lit in the park to

523
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,400
guide the carriages.

524
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,760
The Chateau la Vaubyessard, a large building
in sixteenth-century style, stood in the centre

525
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,080
of parkland.

526
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,510
A stream flowed between tall trees and beneath
a bridge, and through the evening mist they

527
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,350
could see cottages and farm buildings.

528
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:12,120
Charles stopped the carriage at the foot of
the steps leading up to the front door, and

529
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,150
two servants came down to take their bags.

530
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:20,470
Then the Marquis came forward and, offering
his arm to the doctor's lady, walked with

531
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,440
her into the hall.

532
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,750
Under the high ceiling, their voices and footsteps
sounded as if they were in a church.

533
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,820
As she passed through on her way to the main
room, Emma saw large, dark paintings of the

534
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,940
Marquis's relatives, some in the clothes of
the royal court, others in the uniforms of

535
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,920
army or navy officers.

536
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,520
When the Marquis opened the door for them,
one of the ladies rose (it was the Marquise

537
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,930
herself) and came forward to welcome Emma.

538
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,630
She made her sit down beside her on a low
chair, and began to chat with her, as if she

539
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,340
had known her for a long time.

540
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,640
At seven o'clock dinner was served.

541
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,400
The men were seated at the first table, in
the hall, the ladies at the second, in the

542
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,360
dining room, with the Marquis and the Marquise.

543
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:16,410
At the long dining tables, the glasses were
filled with iced champagne.

544
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:21,500
Emma felt a thrill go through her as she tasted
the coldness of it in her mouth.

545
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,440
She had never seen some of the fruit that
they had on the table, and even the sugar

546
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,830
seemed whiter here, and more finely powdered,
than elsewhere.

547
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,780
After dinner, there was dancing.

548
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,160
More guests were arriving and the room filled
with people.

549
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,790
Emma sat down near the door and watched the
men talking and smoking cigars in small groups

550
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,540
in their black and white evening dress, as
the servants moved among them carrying drinks

551
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,430
and more small, delicate things to eat.

552
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:58,070
All along the rows of seated women she could
see smiles half-hidden, half-revealed, by

553
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:04,960
the flowers the ladies held; everywhere there
was silk, the flash of jewels and gold, white

554
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,410
arms, and hair piled high on elegant heads.

555
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:14,430
Emma's heart beat faster when, her partner
holding her by the tips of her fingers, she

556
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,950
took her place in line and stood waiting for
the dance to begin.

557
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:24,300
But her nervousness soon disappeared and,
moving to the music, she flew on as light

558
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,310
as a bird.

559
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,730
The memories of her past life, which until
then had always been so clear, disappeared

560
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,890
so completely in the magic of the moment that
she could hardly persuade herself they were

561
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,330
not a dream.

562
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,310
There she was.

563
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,280
No doubt about that!

564
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:49,410
During a break in the dancing supper was served,
and again the wine flowed freely, accompanied

565
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:55,160
by sea-food soup, sweet puddings and all kinds
of cold meats.

566
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,780
Now people with longer journeys began to get
into their carriages and drive off one after

567
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
another.

568
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,800
Charles was half-asleep with his back against
a door.

569
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,230
But not everyone was ready to leave, and it
was at three in the morning when the last

570
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,600
dance began.

571
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,530
Only the guests who were staying the night
at the chateau were still there.

572
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:22,350
One of these, a Viscount whose evening dress
fitted him like a glove, came a second time

573
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,880
to invite Madame Bovary to dance.

574
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,270
They began slowly, and then increased their
speed.

575
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:35,430
They turned, and everything around them turned
- the lamps, the furniture and the floor.

576
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,460
As they swung past the doors, Emma's dress
blew up in the air.

577
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:45,281
The Viscount looked down at her, she raised
her eyes to his; for a moment she lost her

578
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:46,690
breath and stopped.

579
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:52,080
Then off they went again, quicker than ever,
racing down to the high windows at the far

580
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,510
end of the room, where she nearly fell and,
for a moment, rested her head on his chest.

581
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:04,160
And then, still turning, but more gently now,
he took her to her seat.

582
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,540
She leaned back against the wall and covered
her eyes with her hands.

583
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:15,330
Then there was a little more conversation
and, after saying goodnight (or good morning),

584
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,540
the guests went off to bed.

585
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,540
Charles dragged himself upstairs on heavy
legs.

586
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,560
But Emma did not want to sleep.

587
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,460
She opened the window and sat with her head
in her hand.

588
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,030
The night was dark.

589
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,610
A few drops of rain were falling.

590
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,710
She breathed in the damp wind that blew cool
against her eyelids.

591
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:43,060
The dance music was still playing in her ears,
and she tried to keep awake in order to keep

592
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,870
the dream alive for as long as she could.

593
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:52,720
As she stood there, the sun began to rise
beyond the trees and she shivered with cold.

594
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,900
She undressed and got down between the sheets,
close up to Charles, who was asleep.

595
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,710
There were twelve or fifteen of them at breakfast,
which, to Charles's surprise, was all over

596
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,740
in ten minutes.

597
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:12,380
After that, a small group went with Mademoiselle
d'Andervilliers for a walk through the park,

598
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,940
and then, to amuse the lady, the Marquis took
Emma to see his stables, while Charles went

599
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,390
to ask one of the men to bring his horse and
carriage.

600
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:27,650
When Emma returned, the Bovarys said their
goodbyes to the Marquis and Marquise and turned

601
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,560
their horse's head towards Tostes and home.

602
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,170
Emma sat in silence.

603
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,630
Their bags banged against the back of the
carriage as they made their way down the rough

604
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,420
road.

605
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,650
They had reached the high ground at Thibourville
when suddenly a group of gentlemen, laughing

606
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,480
and smoking cigars, rode past them.

607
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,490
Emma thought she recognized the Viscount who
had danced with her last night.

608
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,190
She turned round to have another look, but
they were already too far away.

609
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:02,470
A little later, they had to stop to make a
small repair to the carriage.

610
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:07,570
When he had finished, Charles noticed something
lying on the ground between his horse's legs.

611
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:13,780
He bent down and picked up a beautifully-made
green silk cigar-case with two cigars still

612
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,360
inside it.

613
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,030
'They'll be good this evening after dinner.'

614
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,440
He put the case in his pocket and started
the horse.

615
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,750
When they got home, the evening meal was not
ready.

616
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:32,160
Madame became angry and the maid, Nastasie,
replied rudely.

617
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,960
'You can leave,' said Emma.

618
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,130
'You are finished here!'

619
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:43,020
So all they had for dinner was onion soup
with a small piece of meat and some vegetables.

620
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:48,730
'How nice it is to be back home again!' said
Charles, cheerfully rubbing his hands as he

621
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,590
sat down opposite Emma.

622
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,210
They could hear Nastasie weeping as they ate.

623
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,780
Charles was rather fond of the poor girl,
who had kept him company after his first wife

624
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,630
died, when he had nothing to do.

625
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,810
She had been his first patient, the first
person he ever got to know in Tostes.

626
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,230
'Have you really told her to leave?' he said
at last.

627
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,230
'Yes.

628
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,670
Why not?'

629
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,860
she replied.

630
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,930
After supper, they went into the kitchen to
warm themselves while the bedroom was being

631
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,020
prepared.

632
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,980
Charles began to smoke.

633
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,750
He pushed out his lips, spat repeatedly, and
pulled his head back every time he breathed

634
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,620
in the smoke from the cigar.

635
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,730
'You'll make yourself ill!'

636
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,910
she said.

637
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:39,120
He put the cigar down, and went to get himself
a drink of water.

638
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:46,580
Quick as lightning, Emma picked up the cigar-case
and threw it into the back of the cupboard.

639
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,880
Time went so slowly the next day!

640
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,940
Emma walked around her little garden, up and
down, up and down, stopping to look at the

641
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,870
flower-beds, at the fruit trees; looking at
all these familiar things, things that she

642
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:04,370
knew so well but which now seemed so strange.

643
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,450
How far away the chateau seemed already!

644
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:14,220
Her journey to La Vaubyessard had changed
her life, but left it feeling empty.

645
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,090
However, she accepted her fate.

646
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:23,000
She folded up her beautiful dress and laid
it carefully away in the chest of drawers,

647
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,190
with her dancing shoes.

648
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,120
She had now known wealth and luxury, and life
would never be the same.

649
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,620
The memory of this visit to the chateau became
part of her life.

650
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:41,382
Each Wednesday she would sigh as she awoke
and say to herself, 'A week ago today...

651
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:48,990
a fortnight ago... three weeks ago, I was
there!'

652
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:55,420
But little by little the faces of the people
became faint in her memory, and she forgot

653
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,270
the tunes she had danced to.

654
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:03,690
The servants' clothes, the look of the rooms
came back less clearly to her vision.

655
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:12,720
Some of the details faded away, but the empty
space in her heart remained.

656
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,041
CHAPTER FIVE
Moving Home

657
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:22,370
Often, when Charles was out of the house,
Emma would go to the cupboard and take out

658
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,420
the green silk cigar-case she had hidden there.

659
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,490
It must have belonged to the Viscount.

660
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:33,890
Perhaps it was a present from a lady friend
in Paris, made with love and care in every

661
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,410
stitch.

662
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,940
Paris!

663
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,640
What sort of a place was it?

664
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,640
'Paris!'

665
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,831
- she said the name under her breath, because
she loved the sound of it.

666
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:50,010
It was like the great bell in an old church;
the word seemed to add a golden light to everything

667
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:56,160
around it - even to the labels of her little
pots of cheap make-up.

668
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,870
She bought a guidebook to Paris and, with
her fingertip on the map, she would make little

669
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:04,240
imaginary journeys around the capital.

670
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,600
She pretended she was walking along the wide
streets, looking in wonder at the great houses.

671
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:16,310
At last, growing tired, she would let her
eyes close, and then in the darkness she dreamed

672
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,970
she saw the flame of the street lamps, and
the steps of the carriages being let down

673
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,900
at the entrance to the theatre.

674
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:30,540
She buried herself in women's magazines, reading
every word about opera and fashion and the

675
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,920
life of the rich.

676
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,440
She read the latest novels - even bringing
her book with her to the table and turning

677
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,580
the pages while Charles ate and talked.

678
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:46,830
And as she read, the memory of the Viscount
came back to her and her dreams became more

679
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:51,460
important, more real to her than her life
as a country doctor's wife.

680
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,030
But she tried to improve things in her house.

681
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:00,840
She taught her maid to hand a glass of water
held in a white cloth, to knock before entering

682
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,610
a room, to dress her mistress.

683
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:10,550
In the daytime, Emma wore a long dress with
a silk belt and little red silk shoes.

684
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:16,850
She had bought herself a writing-case, a pen-holder
and some envelopes, although she had no one

685
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,080
to write to.

686
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,310
She thought she would like to travel, or to
go back to her school.

687
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:28,570
She wanted to die - and she wanted to go and
live in Paris.

688
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:34,240
And Charles rode from farm to farm on his
old horse.

689
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,930
He ate breakfast in farmhouse kitchens, visited
sick people in their dirty beds, got blood

690
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:44,610
on his hands and face and listened to the
last words of the dying.

691
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:50,990
But every night he came home to a fire, a
good dinner, a comfortable chair, and a pretty

692
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,810
wife who had so many little ways of giving
pleasure.

693
00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:01,140
It might be paper shades for the candles,
a new ribbon for her dress or an extraordinary

694
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:07,990
name for a very ordinary dish, which Charles
ate happily, enjoying every bit of it.

695
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:12,880
Everything Emma did added something to the
pleasure of his senses and of his home.

696
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,010
It was like finding gold-dust in the middle
of the narrow pathway of his life.

697
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,260
He felt well, and looked well.

698
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,200
People liked him.

699
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:28,260
He talked to their children, did not drink,
could be trusted and was especially good with

700
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,730
the chest complaints that were so common among
country people.

701
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:37,440
A major reason for Charles's success was that
he was so afraid of killing his patients that

702
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,260
he never gave them anything more than simple
medicines - but he was not frightened of surgery,

703
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,580
and had a strong wrist when he pulled teeth.

704
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,030
The people of the region were happy with their
doctor.

705
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,790
Charles did have some ambitions.

706
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:58,520
He tried to read a professional journal after
dinner, but the warmth of the room and the

707
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,080
good meal he had eaten would send him to sleep
after five minutes.

708
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,660
And there he sat, his head resting on his
two hands and his long hair hanging over his

709
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,440
face.

710
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,380
Emma looked at him and asked herself why she
had not got one of those strong, silent men

711
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:21,900
for a husband, men who sit up at night with
their books, and become famous, if not rich.

712
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,070
She would have liked the name of Bovary, which
was hers now, to be famous, to be seen in

713
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,300
the bookshops, talked about in the papers,
known all over France.

714
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:37,540
But Charles did not have that kind of ambition,
and sometimes she felt like hitting him.

715
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,460
'What a man!

716
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,510
What a poor kind of man!'

717
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,120
she said to herself, biting her lips.

718
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:53,550
So as time went on, Emma felt herself less
and less able to put up with her husband.

719
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,150
He was growing more unpleasant as he got older.

720
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:01,690
He sucked his teeth after eating, and made
a horrible noise at every mouthful of soup

721
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,520
he swallowed.

722
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,400
As he was beginning to put on weight, his
eyes, which were already small, looked as

723
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,580
if they would start to disappear into his
increasingly fat face.

724
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,560
Deep down in her heart, she was waiting for
something to happen.

725
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,670
She did not know what it would be, what the
wind would blow to her.

726
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:28,010
But every morning when she awoke, she hoped
it would come that day.

727
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:32,960
She listened to every sound, watched every
new face in the street outside her house for

728
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,740
a sign, and could not understand why nothing
happened.

729
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:45,960
And then at sunset, sadder than ever, she
would long for the next day to come.

730
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,600
The spring came again.

731
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:55,220
With the first touch of heat, when the apple
trees were in flower, she began to have attacks

732
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,040
of dizziness.

733
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,560
And when July came, she counted on her fingers
how many weeks it would be to October, thinking

734
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:09,250
that perhaps the Marquis d'Andervilliers would
be giving another dance at La Vaubyessard.

735
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:15,660
But September came and went, and no one called
or wrote.

736
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:20,710
After this disappointment there was the same
emptiness in her heart, and the empty days

737
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,730
began again as before.

738
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:28,530
The future was like a corridor in which there
was no light, and at the end of it only a

739
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,250
closed door.

740
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,410
She gave up her music.

741
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,020
What was the use of playing?

742
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,450
Who was there to hear?

743
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,030
She stopped her drawing.

744
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,520
What was the good, what was the good of it
all?

745
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,400
Even sewing bored her.

746
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,840
'There's nothing left to read,' she said to
herself.

747
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,650
And there she sat, staring at the falling
rain.

748
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,280
Was this hopeless life going to last for ever?

749
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,650
Was there no escape?

750
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,200
She knew she was just as good as the luckier
ones.

751
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,170
At La Vaubyessard she had seen great ladies
who were not as pretty or intelligent as her;

752
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,580
why was she so unlucky?

753
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:16,160
She would lean her head against the wall and
weep, wanting so much for a life of excitement,

754
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,130
pleasures, all the delights which must be
out there in the world, but which were not

755
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,130
hers.

756
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:28,390
There were days when she would talk and talk;
then the excitement would die away, and she

757
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:35,880
would fall back into a kind of dream world
and sit without moving or saying a word.

758
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:42,040
As she was always saying how she hated Tostes,
Charles thought her illness must be caused

759
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,590
by the place itself.

760
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:51,030
The idea grew on him, and he began seriously
to think of going elsewhere.

761
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:55,650
Then she started drinking vinegar to make
herself lose weight, coughed a little dry

762
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,060
cough and could not touch her food.

763
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,940
It was hard for Charles to leave Tostes.

764
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,120
He had been there for four years and was building
a good practice.

765
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,330
However, what must be must be.

766
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,120
He took her to Rouen to see another doctor.

767
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,450
The doctor said it was a case of nerves.

768
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:19,260
What she needed was a change.

769
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,790
So Charles looked around all over the place,
and at last heard of a busy little market

770
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:29,200
town called Yonville-l'Abbaye, somewhere in
the Neufchatel area, where the doctor had

771
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,820
recently left town and no replacement had
been found.

772
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,620
He wrote to the local pharmacist asking him
to let him know how many people there were

773
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:43,530
in the place, what sort of competition there
was, and how much a year the other man used

774
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,530
to make.

775
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:50,370
The answers were satisfactory, and Charles
decided he would make a move in the spring

776
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:55,260
if Emma's health had not improved.

777
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,000
One day, when she was emptying a drawer in
preparation for the move, Emma felt something

778
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,820
sharp against her finger.

779
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:08,200
It was the piece of wire around her wedding
flowers, faded and dusty now, and the ribbon

780
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,370
eaten by insects.

781
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:15,710
She threw them on the fire, where they burned
like a handful of dry grass and then lay like

782
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:17,960
a red bush in the fireplace.

783
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:25,210
As she watched them burn, the paper berries
burst, the wire bent and twisted, and the

784
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:31,280
paper flowers were held in the hot air like
black insects until, at last, they flew up

785
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,440
the chimney.

786
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:41,330
In March, when they left Tostes, Madame Bovary
was pregnant.

787
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:44,720
CHAPTER SIX
Yonville

788
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,720
Yonville-l'Abbaye is a market town about twenty-six
kilometres from Rouen, between the Abbeville

789
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,240
and Beauvais roads.

790
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:59,110
It is on the borders of Normandy, Picardy
and the Ile-de-France, the sort of place where

791
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:03,150
the language has no accent and the landscape
no character.

792
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:08,620
Here they make the worst cheese in the whole
district, and farming is expensive because

793
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:13,450
the sandy, stony soil is so poor.

794
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:19,440
Until 1835 there was no good road to Yonville,
and although a new one has been built, nothing

795
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,500
has really changed there for a hundred years.

796
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:28,260
Walking into the town you still pass small
farmhouses set in their own gardens, and see

797
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,610
that the fields stretch almost into the centre
of the town.

798
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:37,270
The market, with its red roof supported by
twenty or more wooden posts, takes up half

799
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,530
of the town square.

800
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:45,170
The Town Hall is a large, important looking
building, but what really catches the eye

801
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:52,630
is the pharmacy of Monsieur Homais just opposite
the town's one hotel, the Lion d'Or.

802
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:57,250
The pharmacy is especially attractive at night
when the lamps are lit and the big red and

803
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:02,520
green glass bottles in the window send long
beams of coloured light far out along the

804
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,600
ground.

805
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,130
From top to bottom, the building is covered
with advertisements for medicines and mineral

806
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:14,110
water, and the shop-sign which goes right
across the front carries in golden letters

807
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,690
the words 'Homais, Pharmacist'.

808
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:23,130
At the far end of the shop, the word 'Laboratory'
appears over a glass door on which, halfway

809
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:28,120
up, the name 'Homais' is repeated in more
gold letters on black.

810
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,810
And that is all there is worth seeing in Yonville.

811
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:37,490
The one and only street, with a shop or two
on either side of it, stops at the bend in

812
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:39,010
the road.

813
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:43,960
If you turn to your right and follow the path
at the foot of the hill, you come to the cemetery.

814
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:50,700
The night the Bovarys arrived in Yonville,
Madame Lefrancois, who ran the inn, was so

815
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:56,470
busy that the sweat ran down her face as she
rushed around among her pots and pans.

816
01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:00,880
Tomorrow was market day and she still had
the meat to cook, the soup to make and the

817
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,360
coffee to get ready.

818
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,280
Then there was the meal for her regular customers,
as well as for the new doctor and his wife

819
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,400
and maid - whose coach was now half an hour
late.

820
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:17,560
Shouts of laughter came from the bar, where
three workmen were calling for more wine and

821
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,480
the wood fire was burning.

822
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:25,260
A man in soft green leather shoes, a smoking
cap on his head, was standing warming his

823
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,330
back by the fire.

824
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:32,530
He had a look of complete self-satisfaction
on his face, and he appeared to be as carefree

825
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,200
as the small bird in the cage which hung from
the ceiling.

826
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:43,330
It was the pharmacist, waiting for the evening
meal which he regularly ate at the hotel.

827
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,550
He did not have to wait too long.

828
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:51,230
Soon, Madame Lefrancois heard the sound of
wheels and the metal shoes of a tired horse

829
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,280
on the road outside.

830
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,440
As soon as the coach stopped, other villagers
came to the inn, and all began to speak at

831
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,850
once, asking for news, explanations and packages
they had been waiting for.

832
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:10,200
As he gave out his parcels, Hivert, the coachman,
told them they had been delayed because Madame

833
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:15,850
Bovary's little dog had run away and had not
been found.

834
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,680
Emma had, in fact, been crying for the last
hour.

835
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,780
She said it was Charles's fault.

836
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,550
Monsieur Lheureux, who was travelling inside
the coach and who had the fabric shop in the

837
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:31,560
village, had done his best to make her happier
by telling her of several cases in which dogs

838
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,090
had come back to their masters after years
of separation.

839
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:40,520
There was a story, he said, of a dog that
found its way back to Paris all the way from

840
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,360
Constantinople!

841
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:49,570
Dog or no dog, they had arrived at their new
home, and had to leave the coach.

842
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:55,710
Emma got out first, then Felicite, her maid,
and then Monsieur Lheureux.

843
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:01,460
They had to wake Charles up; he had fallen
asleep in his corner as soon as it grew dark.

844
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:07,620
Homais introduced himself, offered his services
to Madame and his respects to Monsieur, told

845
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:12,080
them he was charmed to have been able to do
them a service, adding with a smile that he

846
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,000
had invited himself to dinner as his wife
was away from home.

847
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,740
As soon as she was in the kitchen, Madame
Bovary went over to the fire.

848
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:26,220
With the tips of two fingers she took hold
of her dress at the knee and, raising it above

849
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,700
her ankles, stretched out a foot to the flames
- a little foot in a black boot.

850
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:38,570
The fire lit her from top to toe, its red
light making her dress shine and showing the

851
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,140
perfect white skin of her face.

852
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:47,900
On the other side of the fireplace, a fair-haired
young man watched her in silence.

853
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:56,250
Monsieur Leon Dupuis, clerk to the town's
only lawyer, also ate regularly at the Lion

854
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,250
d'Or.

855
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:02,470
As he found life in Yonville almost impossibly
boring, he would often delay his meal in the

856
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:06,430
hope that a traveller would arrive at the
inn with whom he could enjoy a conversation

857
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:07,770
in the evening.

858
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:12,610
It was therefore with some pleasure that he
accepted the suggestion that he should sit

859
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,460
down with the Bovarys.

860
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:21,520
At the table, Homais asked permission to keep
on his cap, for fear of catching cold.

861
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,640
'Madame must be a little tired,' he said,
turning to Emma.

862
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,670
'It is not a comfortable journey.'

863
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:33,050
'Very true,' she answered, 'but I love moving
around.

864
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,700
I hate staying in one place.'

865
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,090
'Oh, I agree.

866
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:41,110
Staying in one place is horrible!' said the
clerk.

867
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:46,460
'But if you were like me,' said Charles, 'and
always had to be on your horse...'

868
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,230
And so the meal continued.

869
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:54,610
Charles spent most of his time discussing
medical matters with Monsieur Homais, while

870
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:59,260
Leon told Madame Bovary about the attractions
of the neighbourhood.

871
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,970
They quickly discovered that they shared the
same romantic tastes.

872
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:10,210
'I think there's nothing so beautiful as a
sunset, especially by the sea!' said Madame

873
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,210
Bovary.

874
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,950
'Oh, I love the sea!'

875
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,430
Monsieur Leon replied.

876
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:21,620
'And doesn't it seem to you, somehow, that
you think more freely, and that it raises

877
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:26,350
your soul and makes you think of the endless
nature of things?'

878
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:29,970
'It's just the same where there are mountains,'
Leon went on.

879
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:37,400
So they continued talking of Switzerland and
Italy, which they had never visited, and music,

880
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:44,580
which neither of them could play, and reading
- the one thing that both of them did enthusiastically.

881
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:49,840
'What can be better than sitting by the fire
in the evening with a book, when the lamp

882
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,890
is lit and the wind beats against the window?'
said Leon.

883
01:06:53,890 --> 01:07:01,290
'That's just what I think,' she replied, looking
at him with her big, dark eyes.

884
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,940
'You forget everything,' he went on.

885
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,790
'The hours slip by.

886
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:11,980
Sitting still in your armchair, you can wander
in strange places and imagine they are there

887
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,120
before your eyes.'

888
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,950
'Oh yes, that's true!'

889
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:16,950
she said.

890
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:23,200
They had been at the table for two and a half
hours by now, since Artemise, the servant,

891
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,560
did not hurry as she brought the dishes in
from the kitchen.

892
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:32,070
Quite unconsciously, Leon had put his foot
up on one of the bars of the chair on which

893
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:38,130
Madame Bovary was sitting, moving closer so
he could catch everything she said.

894
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:43,170
And so, while Charles and the pharmacist went
on with their discussion, Emma and Leon sat

895
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:48,560
close to one another, and entered into a conversation
in which they talked about the interests they

896
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:55,330
shared: the Paris theatres, names of novels,
the latest dances, the world of fashion, which

897
01:07:55,330 --> 01:08:01,190
neither of them knew anything about, Tostes,
where she had lived, and Yonville, where they

898
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,770
were now.

899
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:09,600
They discussed anything and everything, and
talked all through dinner.

900
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,560
When the coffee was brought in, Felicite went
to arrange the bedroom in the new house, and

901
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:19,489
the group around the dinner table soon afterwards
rose to go.

902
01:08:19,489 --> 01:08:24,779
Madame Lefrancois had fallen asleep by the
dying fire, while the manservant, lamp in

903
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:27,801
hand, was waiting to show Monsieur and Madame
Bovary to their house.

904
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:33,210
The house felt damp and cold after the warmth
of the inn.

905
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:37,489
The walls were new and the wooden stairs had
no carpet.

906
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:44,120
Upstairs in the bedroom, a pale light came
in through the curtainless windows.

907
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:50,960
The tops of some trees could just be seen,
and beyond them, the fields in the moonlight.

908
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,850
This would be the fourth time Emma had slept
in a new bedroom.

909
01:08:54,850 --> 01:09:00,179
The first was when she went to the convent,
the second when she came to Tostes, the third

910
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:03,789
at La Vaubyessard, and now this was the fourth.

911
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:08,900
And every time, it had seemed as if she were
entering a new stage in her life.

912
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:14,190
She could not believe that things would look
and be the same in different places.

913
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:21,540
The most recent period of her life had been
bad, so the next part would have to be better.

914
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:26,440
CHAPTER SEVEN
In Love

915
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:35,549
Next morning, when she awoke, Emma saw the
clerk walking across the square.

916
01:09:35,549 --> 01:09:37,619
She was in her dressing-gown.

917
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:39,829
He looked up and took off his hat.

918
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:43,350
She gave a little nod and quickly shut the
window.

919
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:48,509
All day long, Leon waited for six o'clock
to arrive.

920
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:54,170
But when he went round to the inn, the only
person there was Monsieur Binet, the tax collector,

921
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,710
already seated at the table.

922
01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:00,909
The dinner of the night before had been an
important event for Leon.

923
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:06,900
It was the first time in his life that he
had talked to a woman for a whole evening.

924
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:11,699
How did he manage to tell her, and in such
brilliant language, so many things he could

925
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:14,170
not have expressed so well before?

926
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:19,179
Unfortunately, it did not look as if he would
have the chance to repeat his performance

927
01:10:19,179 --> 01:10:20,370
for the moment.

928
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:26,449
Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist, however,
was able to visit Madame Bovary and show what

929
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:28,289
a good neighbour he was.

930
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:33,610
He told her all about the shopkeepers, where
to get her butter cheaply, and he helped her

931
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,889
find a gardener.

932
01:10:35,889 --> 01:10:39,780
It has to be said, however, that he was not
doing this out of pure kindness.

933
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:45,619
Monsieur Homais had, a year earlier, broken
the law which forbade the practice of medicine

934
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:48,820
by all unqualified persons.

935
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:53,920
Someone had told the authorities, and Monsieur
Homais had been given a very severe warning

936
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,090
by the magistrate in Rouen.

937
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:01,349
The problem was that he still liked to give
quick, innocent consultations in his shop,

938
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:08,659
but the Mayor did not like him, others were
jealous, and he was playing a dangerous game.

939
01:11:08,659 --> 01:11:13,040
So Monsieur Homais thought to himself that
if he did things for Monsieur and Madame Bovary,

940
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,590
Monsieur Bovary would be grateful, and a grateful
man does not make complaints to the authorities

941
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:21,349
in Rouen.

942
01:11:21,349 --> 01:11:26,940
Every morning, Homais would come across with
the newspaper and often, during the afternoon,

943
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:31,820
he would leave his shop for a minute or two
to chat with the new doctor.

944
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,130
Charles was not a happy man; patients did
not come.

945
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:40,949
He sat for hour after hour in silence, or
he went to sleep in his surgery or watched

946
01:11:40,949 --> 01:11:42,230
his wife sew.

947
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:47,380
He even started doing some small jobs at home,
trying to paint the bedroom with some paint

948
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,739
the men had left behind.

949
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,489
Money was his great worry.

950
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:58,380
He had spent such a lot on repairs at Tostes,
on his wife's clothes and on moving, and most

951
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,650
of his savings and Emma's money had gone in
two years.

952
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:08,431
But Charles also had something pleasant to
think about, as his wife was expecting a child,

953
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:13,630
and the closer they got to the time, the more
loving he became.

954
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:19,800
It was another link between them, real evidence
of their marriage.

955
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,739
When he watched her heavier walk, when she
sat opposite him at the table, or when she

956
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:30,300
was in her armchair after dinner, he could
not stop himself getting up, kissing her,

957
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:34,409
stroking her face, calling her 'little mother'.

958
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:38,159
The idea of being a father pleased him very
much.

959
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,579
He lacked nothing.

960
01:12:40,579 --> 01:12:47,179
At first Emma was surprised by his attention;
then all she wanted was to have the baby as

961
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:53,130
soon as possible, so that she would know how
it felt to be a mother.

962
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:56,679
Their shortage of money meant that she could
not buy all the things she wanted for the

963
01:12:56,679 --> 01:13:02,090
new arrival, so perhaps she did not feel as
much love for the child she carried as she

964
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,179
wanted to give.

965
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,119
But she thought about it all the time.

966
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:09,190
She hoped it would be a boy.

967
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:13,579
He should be strong and dark, and they would
call him George.

968
01:13:13,579 --> 01:13:16,469
And the thought of having a boy somehow made
her feel better.

969
01:13:16,469 --> 01:13:21,380
A man would be free, while a woman is always
limited.

970
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:26,499
She is weaker and economically dependent,
and the habits of society do not permit her

971
01:13:26,499 --> 01:13:28,889
the same freedom.

972
01:13:28,889 --> 01:13:36,530
Emma's baby was born on a Sunday morning at
about six, just as the sun was rising.

973
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:41,409
'It's a girl,' said Charles.

974
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:44,389
She turned away her head and fainted.

975
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:50,560
Madame Homais came to the house as soon as
the news was given to congratulate her, and

976
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,199
so did Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or.

977
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:57,789
The pharmacist offered his congratulations
through the half-open door.

978
01:13:57,789 --> 01:14:04,440
He then asked to see the baby and declared
it was the most well formed he had ever seen.

979
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:10,190
As the doctor felt that his wife was not strong
enough to feed the baby herself, the little

980
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,400
girl was sent to a wet nurse.

981
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:18,320
With nothing else to do in the days after
the birth, Emma tried to think of a name for

982
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,369
her daughter.

983
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:26,190
First she went through names with Italian
endings, like Clara, Louisa, Amanda.

984
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:32,610
She rather liked old names like Galsuinde,
or Yseult or Leocadie.

985
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:35,809
Charles wanted the child to be called after
her mother.

986
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,630
Emma said no.

987
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:44,139
At last Emma remembered that at the Chateau
de la Vaubyessard she had heard the Marquise

988
01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:46,880
call a young woman by the name of Berthe.

989
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,860
That decision was made.

990
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:57,199
Four or five weeks after the birth, Emma felt
a sudden need to see her little girl, so she

991
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:01,630
set out in the direction of the wet nurse's
house at the far end of the village.

992
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:06,290
It was midday and the sun beat down from a
cloudless sky.

993
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:12,349
A hot wind was blowing and when she had gone
some way, Emma began to feel weak from the

994
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:14,280
effort of walking.

995
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,849
She started to think she should return home
or go in somewhere and sit down.

996
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:25,699
Just then, Monsieur Leon came out from a house
close by, with some papers under his arm.

997
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:31,390
He came up and spoke, and took her into the
shade outside Lheureux's shop.

998
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:35,579
Madame Bovary said she was on her way to see
her baby, but that she was beginning to feel

999
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:36,719
tired.

1000
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:43,030
'If...' began Leon, but he stopped, not daring
to continue.

1001
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:45,409
'Are you very busy?'

1002
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:46,989
she asked.

1003
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:52,619
And when the clerk said that he was not, she
begged him to walk with her.

1004
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:57,050
To reach the nurse's house they had to go
along to the end of the street and then turn,

1005
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,889
as if they were going to the cemetery.

1006
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:04,880
They set off side by side, and recognized
the house by an old tree that shaded it.

1007
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:11,900
It was a low, badly maintained house with
a brown roof and small, untidy garden.

1008
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,019
Hearing the gate open, the woman came out,
carrying a baby at her breast.

1009
01:16:16,019 --> 01:16:21,140
With her other hand she was dragging along
a poor, miserable-looking two-year-old with

1010
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,219
spots all over his face.

1011
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:25,730
'Come in,' she said.

1012
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:30,420
'Your little one is in there asleep.'

1013
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:35,739
She went into the dark bedroom, and showed
Emma where the little girl was sleeping.

1014
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:41,280
Emma took the baby in her arms, wrapped up
in a dirty blanket, and began to sing gently

1015
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,429
as she held her.

1016
01:16:42,429 --> 01:16:45,630
Leon walked up and down the room.

1017
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:53,080
It seemed strange to him to see this beautiful,
elegantly dressed woman in such poor surroundings.

1018
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,829
Madame Bovary saw him looking and blushed
bright red.

1019
01:16:55,829 --> 01:17:01,540
He turned away, thinking he had perhaps seemed
too curious, as she gave the baby back to

1020
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,540
the nurse.

1021
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:06,679
It had just been sick all over her collar.

1022
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:11,900
Having lost enthusiasm for her baby, Emma
again took Monsieur Leon's arm, and they left

1023
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:17,469
the nurse holding the child and waving as
they went down the path.

1024
01:17:17,469 --> 01:17:22,810
Emma walked quickly for some distance, then
slowed down.

1025
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:27,619
As she looked around her, her eyes rested
on the young man's shoulder and on his well-cut

1026
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:30,449
coat with its smart black collar.

1027
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:35,480
She noticed how his golden brown hair was
smooth and carefully brushed, and that his

1028
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:42,340
fingernails were longer and much more carefully
cared for than most fingernails in Yonville.

1029
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,969
They went back to the village on the path
beside the river.

1030
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:51,579
The stream flowed on noiselessly, deep and
cool; dark plants moved in the water like

1031
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:57,829
long green hair, and insects walked over its
smooth surface or waited with shining wings

1032
01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:01,000
on the tall grass at the water's edge.

1033
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:07,130
All around, as far as the eye could see, the
fields had emptied of people.

1034
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:11,880
It was dinner-time in the farms, and the only
sounds that fell on the ears of the young

1035
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:17,739
woman and her companion were their footsteps
on the path, the words they spoke and Emma's

1036
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:21,369
dress brushing against the grass.

1037
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:25,739
The garden walls were hot in the sun, and
the wild plants that were growing between

1038
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:27,960
the stones had died.

1039
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:33,659
As she passed, Madame Bovary touched some
of their dry flowers, which made them fall

1040
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:35,800
into yellow dust.

1041
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:41,300
They were talking about some Spanish dancers
who were going to perform at the theatre in

1042
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,300
Rouen.

1043
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,000
'Will you go?' she asked.

1044
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,809
'If I can,' he replied.

1045
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:51,440
Was this all they had to say to one another?

1046
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:56,829
They tried to speak of ordinary, everyday
things, but all the time they felt a deep

1047
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:58,630
change coming over them.

1048
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:05,219
It was like a whisper from the soul, deep
down, stronger than the spoken word.

1049
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:10,349
Lost in wonder at this strange sweetness,
they did not speak of it or try to explain

1050
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:11,760
what was happening.

1051
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:18,010
But both felt that there could be future pleasures
waiting for them.

1052
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:22,840
When they came to her garden, Madame Bovary
pushed open the little gate and, running up

1053
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,150
the steps, disappeared from view.

1054
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:29,320
Leon went back to his office.

1055
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,900
His boss was out.

1056
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,659
He looked quickly at some papers, prepared
a pen for writing, but then put on his hat

1057
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,480
and went out.

1058
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,730
He went up to the edge of the woods, threw
himself down on the ground under the trees

1059
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:47,520
and looked at the sky through his fingers.

1060
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,139
'Oh!' he sighed.

1061
01:19:50,139 --> 01:19:55,960
'I am so bored!'

1062
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,870
As soon as the weather began to turn cold,
Emma spent her days in the sitting room.

1063
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:06,110
It was a long room with a low ceiling, and
above the fireplace there was a picture of

1064
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:09,239
the sea and a large mirror.

1065
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:12,869
She pulled her chair close to the window so
that she could watch the villagers as they

1066
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:14,539
went by on the pavement.

1067
01:20:14,539 --> 01:20:20,329
Twice a day, Leon passed from his work to
the Lion d'Or.

1068
01:20:20,329 --> 01:20:24,310
Emma could recognize his steps from a long
way away.

1069
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:29,409
She leaned forward and listened, and the young
man walked past, always dressed the same and

1070
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:32,239
always looking straight in front of him.

1071
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:36,559
In the evening, when she had dropped her piece
of unfinished sewing on her lap and was sitting

1072
01:20:36,559 --> 01:20:41,870
with her chin resting on her left hand, she
would again notice his figure moving past

1073
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:47,119
the window, and then she would get up and
tell the girl to lay the table for dinner.

1074
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:52,039
Monsieur Homais would often come in while
they were eating.

1075
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:57,510
Smoking cap in hand, he would come in quietly,
not wanting to disturb anyone, and always

1076
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,920
saying the same thing: 'Good evening, everybody.'

1077
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:07,050
Having taken his usual place at the table,
between husband and wife, he asked the doctor

1078
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:13,280
about his patients, and the doctor consulted
him about the sort of fees he ought to charge.

1079
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,949
Then they began to discuss the news in the
paper.

1080
01:21:15,949 --> 01:21:21,380
At eight o'clock the pharmacist's assistant,
Justin, would come for him to go over and

1081
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,230
shut up the shop.

1082
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:30,489
On Sundays, the Bovarys would return these
visits and spend the evening at the pharmacist's.

1083
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:35,250
They would begin with cards - Monsieur Homais
usually being Emma's partner.

1084
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:40,270
Leon would stand behind her and tell her what
to play.

1085
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:44,510
Every time she threw a card on the table,
the movement would pull up her dress on the

1086
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:51,639
right side, and her hair would move across
her neck like soft brown silk.

1087
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:56,349
When they had finished the cards, the pharmacist
and the doctor would settle down to discuss

1088
01:21:56,349 --> 01:22:01,989
the news of the day and drink their wine and
Emma, changing her place, would sit with her

1089
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:07,719
elbow on the table, turning over the pages
of an illustrated magazine.

1090
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:12,800
Leon sat down beside her, and they looked
at the pictures together, waiting for each

1091
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,710
other at the bottom of the page.

1092
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:18,099
Sometimes she would ask him to read some poetry.

1093
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:24,030
And so a kind of friendship began between
them.

1094
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:29,050
The problem for Leon, however, was to know
what sort of friend Madame Bovary might be.

1095
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:35,020
They gave each other small presents, they
were happy in each other's company, but would

1096
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,340
there be more?

1097
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,829
He thought and thought about this in his lonely
room.

1098
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:42,369
Should he tell her what he was feeling?

1099
01:22:42,369 --> 01:22:45,340
Did he love her, or didn't he?

1100
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:51,770
He was torn between fear of hurting her and
shame at his own lack of courage.

1101
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:54,830
Sometimes he would make up his mind to act,
and to act quickly.

1102
01:22:54,830 --> 01:23:01,540
He wrote letters - and tore them up; decided
on a day to speak to her - and put it off.

1103
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:06,309
Sometimes he walked out of the lawyer's office
with his mind made up.

1104
01:23:06,309 --> 01:23:11,900
But all his courage melted when he found himself
face to face with Emma; and when Charles came

1105
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:17,340
home and invited him to come with him to see
a patient at a farm a few kilometres away,

1106
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:23,159
he at once accepted and, with a bow to Madame,
left with her husband.

1107
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:27,199
But Emma did not ask herself if she was in
love.

1108
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:32,310
Love, she thought, was something that must
come suddenly, like a great thunderstorm,

1109
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:37,920
blowing away your old life and carrying your
heart and soul away, to heaven or to hell.

1110
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:44,249
She never thought about the way a river can
rise slowly, getting higher day by day, until

1111
01:23:44,249 --> 01:23:48,999
after a night of rain it breaks its banks
and floods the land around it.

1112
01:23:48,999 --> 01:23:57,340
In fact, she had no idea of the danger she
was in.

1113
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:03,110
CHAPTER EIGHT
A Dream Ends

1114
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:10,260
One snowy Sunday afternoon in February, Monsieur
and Madame Bovary, Homais and Monsieur Leon

1115
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,369
went to look at a new mill that was being
built outside Yonville.

1116
01:24:14,369 --> 01:24:19,239
Homais had brought his children, to give them
a little exercise.

1117
01:24:19,239 --> 01:24:24,739
The place did not interest Emma, and she stood
away from the group, leaning on Leon's arm,

1118
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:30,699
while Homais and her husband talked about
the technical wonders - the thick walls, the

1119
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:35,229
great machinery - they saw all around them.

1120
01:24:35,229 --> 01:24:40,019
Turning from the pale sunlight coming through
the mist, she saw Charles, his cap pulled

1121
01:24:40,019 --> 01:24:44,460
down over his ears, his thick lips and his
stupid face.

1122
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:51,380
Even his back was annoying, a stupid back
covered in a stupid, boring winter coat.

1123
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,719
Leon moved forward a step.

1124
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:58,989
The cold air had made him pale, even more
beautiful than normal.

1125
01:24:58,989 --> 01:25:04,130
The collar of his shirt was open a little,
showing his white skin; the tip of his ear

1126
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:10,620
was visible under his long hair, and his big
blue eyes, raised upwards to the clouds, seemed

1127
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:18,000
to Emma to be clearer, more beautiful than
those mountain lakes in which the skies are

1128
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,079
mirrored.

1129
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:24,090
Madame Bovary did not go over to her neighbours'
that evening, and when Charles had left and

1130
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:29,040
she felt she was all alone, she lay down on
the carpet in front of the fire and thought

1131
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,889
about Leon once more.

1132
01:25:31,889 --> 01:25:34,599
She thought he was charming.

1133
01:25:34,599 --> 01:25:36,739
She could not put him out of her thoughts.

1134
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:41,590
She remembered how he had stood, the things
he had said, all about him.

1135
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:47,380
And she said over and over again, 'Oh, charming!

1136
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,860
Charming!...

1137
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:50,219
And in love?'

1138
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:52,179
she asked herself.

1139
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,150
'But with whom?...

1140
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,420
But it must be with me!'

1141
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:02,530
The evidence was suddenly clear to her and
her heart gave a great leap.

1142
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:10,179
The firelight became brighter, and she turned
on her back and stretched out her arms.

1143
01:26:10,179 --> 01:26:17,159
After the first excitement, she then thought,
as so many people have before, 'Ah, why did

1144
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:20,510
this happen when it was too late?

1145
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,600
Why not before?

1146
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,679
What prevented it?'

1147
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:28,059
It was midnight when Charles got back.

1148
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:33,249
She pretended she had just woken up and, as
he made a noise undressing, she complained

1149
01:26:33,249 --> 01:26:34,760
of having a headache.

1150
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,900
Then she asked what sort of an evening it
had been.

1151
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:45,489
'Monsieur Leon,' he said, 'went to bed early.'

1152
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:48,159
She could not help smiling.

1153
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:55,100
When she turned over to go to sleep, her heart
was filled with a new happiness.

1154
01:26:55,100 --> 01:27:00,190
Next day, however, she could not settle to
her work in the house; she was happy, but

1155
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:04,480
still could not take pleasure in the things
she usually liked to do.

1156
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:10,050
So when Monsieur Lheureux, the draper, visited
and showed her a beautiful scarf, even offering

1157
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:13,570
to let her pay later, she refused.

1158
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:19,630
And when Leon visited her in the afternoon,
all she could do was to talk about her husband!

1159
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:23,039
The same sort of thing went on for days.

1160
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,610
Her manner and conversation changed completely.

1161
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:31,929
She became interested in housekeeping, started
going to church again regularly, and stopped

1162
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:34,340
the cook stealing the sugar.

1163
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:39,139
She even took her little daughter Berthe away
from the wet nurse and showed her to all her

1164
01:27:39,139 --> 01:27:40,499
visitors.

1165
01:27:40,499 --> 01:27:42,449
She told everyone she loved children.

1166
01:27:42,449 --> 01:27:47,780
They were such a joy and comfort, she said,
as she kissed the child and held her close

1167
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:48,860
to her.

1168
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:53,199
When Charles got home, he would find his chair
ready by the fire.

1169
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:58,190
His clothes were brushed and cleaned, the
buttons were always on his shirts, and his

1170
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,309
shirts were folded carefully after they had
been ironed.

1171
01:28:02,309 --> 01:28:06,960
When Leon saw him at the fireside after dinner,
with his hands on his stomach, his cheeks

1172
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,889
red from the meat and wine, the child crawling
around on the carpet, and this elegant woman

1173
01:28:12,889 --> 01:28:18,440
who would lean over and kiss him over the
back of the chair, he would say to himself,

1174
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,449
'What a fool I am to imagine I could make
her care for me!'

1175
01:28:23,449 --> 01:28:29,610
And as each day passed, Emma became thinner
and paler.

1176
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:36,150
She was so sad and so calm, so gentle and,
at the same time, so distant, that you felt

1177
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:39,170
a sort of icy charm when you were with her.

1178
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:44,539
This charm changed the attitudes of her neighbours;
they no longer saw her as the outsider who

1179
01:28:44,539 --> 01:28:46,860
did not know how to behave properly.

1180
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:53,249
'She's a wonderful woman,' said the pharmacist,
and the married women of Yonville admired

1181
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:57,980
her for her good management, the patients
for her pleasant manners, the poor for her

1182
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:58,980
charity.

1183
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:05,469
But beneath her calm, Emma was in a state
of desire and anger and hatred.

1184
01:29:05,469 --> 01:29:12,989
Her plain, simple dress hid a heart that was
breaking, and she could tell no one, no one!

1185
01:29:12,989 --> 01:29:17,219
She was in love with Leon, but she did not
want to see him.

1186
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:21,739
Her heart beat faster when she heard him coming,
and then, when he was there, the excitement

1187
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:26,159
went away and was replaced by a feeling of
fear and sadness.

1188
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,769
She did not know what to do.

1189
01:29:27,769 --> 01:29:32,800
What made it harder to bear was that Charles
had no understanding of what she was going

1190
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,989
through, and she began to hate him for his
lack of feeling.

1191
01:29:36,989 --> 01:29:41,449
She would have liked Charles to beat her so
that she could have a reason for hating him.

1192
01:29:41,449 --> 01:29:47,730
She was torn between a love she could not
admit to, and a hatred she could not show.

1193
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:54,200
And there she sat at the end of another empty
day, broken, motionless, her face wet with

1194
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
tears.

1195
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,889
'Why don't you tell the doctor about it?'
said her maid when she came in and found her

1196
01:30:00,889 --> 01:30:01,960
like this.

1197
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:06,639
'It's only nerves,' answered Emma.

1198
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,889
'Don't mention it to him.

1199
01:30:07,889 --> 01:30:08,889
He would only worry.'

1200
01:30:08,889 --> 01:30:17,480
If Emma was unhappy, Leon was also less than
pleased with his life, feeling he had nothing

1201
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,900
to look forward to.

1202
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:24,219
He was so tired of Yonville and its inhabitants
that the sight of certain people and certain

1203
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:26,820
houses made him angry.

1204
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:30,909
And when Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist,
tried to amuse him, he found himself disliking

1205
01:30:30,909 --> 01:30:32,229
him too.

1206
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:37,420
The problem was, however, that the thought
of changing things alarmed him as much as

1207
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,849
it excited him.

1208
01:30:38,849 --> 01:30:43,449
And the more he thought about it all, the
more impatient he became.

1209
01:30:43,449 --> 01:30:46,499
'Paris' was the word he kept saying to himself.

1210
01:30:46,499 --> 01:30:51,849
Since he had to go there for his final examinations,
why not go now?

1211
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:52,949
What was stopping him?

1212
01:30:52,949 --> 01:30:56,369
And he began to plan a new life for himself.

1213
01:30:56,369 --> 01:30:58,620
He would live like an artist.

1214
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,139
He would take guitar lessons.

1215
01:31:00,139 --> 01:31:05,250
He would wear a red coat and a blue hat; he
would go to the opera every night and drink

1216
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,890
wine with actresses!

1217
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:12,949
The great difficulty would be to persuade
his mother to agree - but, in fact, it was

1218
01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:13,949
quite easy.

1219
01:31:13,949 --> 01:31:19,659
His own employer had been telling him to take
up work in another office and widen his experience,

1220
01:31:19,659 --> 01:31:24,030
and his mother wanted Leon to qualify as soon
as possible.

1221
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:30,810
Two days after he had sent his letter, she
wrote back to him giving her permission!

1222
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:33,999
When he knew he could leave, however, he did
not hurry.

1223
01:31:33,999 --> 01:31:40,940
Every day, for a whole month, boxes and parcels
were delivered to his rooms in Yonville; and

1224
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:45,980
although Leon had soon made enough preparations
- and more than enough - for a voyage round

1225
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:50,909
the world, he kept putting things off from
week to week.

1226
01:31:50,909 --> 01:31:57,230
However, at last the time came to leave, and
he hardly had time to say goodbye to Monsieur

1227
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,230
Bovary.

1228
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:03,409
He ran up the stairs to the sitting room,
and as he went in Madame Bovary rose quickly.

1229
01:32:03,409 --> 01:32:07,280
'Here I am again!' said Leon.

1230
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,340
'I knew you would come!'

1231
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:15,239
She bit her lip hard, and could feel herself
blush from the roots of her hair to the edge

1232
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:16,499
of her collar.

1233
01:32:16,499 --> 01:32:20,340
She remained standing, leaning her shoulder
against the wall.

1234
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:23,499
'Is the doctor in?' he said.

1235
01:32:23,499 --> 01:32:26,380
'No, he's gone out.'

1236
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,729
And she repeated, 'He's gone out.'

1237
01:32:28,729 --> 01:32:31,579
Then there was silence.

1238
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:36,300
'I would like to kiss Berthe goodbye,' he
said.

1239
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,999
Emma went down a few stairs and called Felicite.

1240
01:32:38,999 --> 01:32:46,190
He gave a long look round - at the walls,
the shelves, the fireplace - as if to carry

1241
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:49,320
the memory of it away with him.

1242
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,030
Emma returned, and the servant came in with
Berthe.

1243
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:55,159
Leon kissed her several times on the neck.

1244
01:32:55,159 --> 01:33:00,349
'Goodbye, my poor little thing; goodbye, my
darling, goodbye.'

1245
01:33:00,349 --> 01:33:03,099
And he gave her back to her mother.

1246
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:06,910
'Take her away,' she said.

1247
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,550
And now they were alone.

1248
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:15,130
Madame Bovary had her back to him, her face
against the glass of the window.

1249
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:19,840
Leon was holding his cap in his hand and beating
it gently against his thigh.

1250
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,710
'It's going to rain,' said Emma.

1251
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:27,710
'I've got a coat,' he answered.

1252
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,850
'Ah!'

1253
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:32,520
She turned away again, her face down.

1254
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:37,210
No one could have said what Emma was looking
at through the glass.

1255
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:42,670
'Well, this is goodbye!' he sighed.

1256
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:45,030
She raised her head with a sudden movement.

1257
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:47,409
'Yes, goodbye...

1258
01:33:47,409 --> 01:33:49,780
Oh, go!'

1259
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,429
They advanced towards each other.

1260
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:54,030
He held out his hand.

1261
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:55,409
She hesitated.

1262
01:33:55,409 --> 01:33:57,920
'In the English style, then!'

1263
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,650
she said, putting hers in his, forcing herself
to laugh.

1264
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:08,340
Leon felt her hand between his fingers, and
it seemed that his whole life flowed into

1265
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,099
it.

1266
01:34:10,099 --> 01:34:19,429
Then he released her hand, their eyes met
for a moment, and he was gone.

1267
01:34:19,429 --> 01:34:21,790
CHAPTER NINE
Starting Again

1268
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:28,960
The next day, for Emma, was like a funeral.

1269
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,719
She felt the same grey unhappiness she had
known when she came back from La Vaubyessard

1270
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:40,960
with the dance tunes playing in her head and
her boring husband sitting opposite her.

1271
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:47,219
In her imagination, Leon came back to her,
taller, more beautiful than ever; though he

1272
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:50,280
was separated from her, he had not left her.

1273
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:55,849
He was there, and the walls of the house seemed
to hold his shadow.

1274
01:34:55,849 --> 01:35:00,389
She asked herself again and again why she
had not taken the chance when it was offered

1275
01:35:00,389 --> 01:35:01,530
to her.

1276
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:06,579
Why hadn't she held him back with both hands,
begged and prayed to him on her knees, when

1277
01:35:06,579 --> 01:35:08,469
he tried to leave?

1278
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:14,079
She cursed herself for not giving her love
to Leon; she was thirsty for his lips.

1279
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:19,469
She wanted to fly after him and join him,
to throw herself into his arms and say, 'I

1280
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:21,429
have come, I am yours!'

1281
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:27,769
But Emma was afraid of all the difficulties
in the way; she wanted Leon and dared not

1282
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:33,530
give herself, and her desire seemed to grow
day by day.

1283
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:37,619
And so the memory of Leon became the centre
of her sorrow.

1284
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:43,849
It shone in the darkness, and she hurried
towards it to warm herself by the dying flames.

1285
01:35:43,849 --> 01:35:51,929
But the fires died down and, little by little,
the flame of love cooled.

1286
01:35:51,929 --> 01:35:56,860
Then the unhappy days of Tostes began all
over again, but she felt herself much more

1287
01:35:56,860 --> 01:36:03,170
unfortunate now; she had experience of grief,
and she knew with certainty that it would

1288
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:05,579
never end.

1289
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:11,709
A woman who has given up as much as she had,
had the right to a few luxuries.

1290
01:36:11,709 --> 01:36:17,349
In a single month, she bought fourteen francs'
worth of lemons to clean her nails.

1291
01:36:17,349 --> 01:36:23,889
She wrote to Rouen and ordered a blue silk
dress, and from Lheureux she bought the finest

1292
01:36:23,889 --> 01:36:25,770
scarf he had in his shop.

1293
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:32,340
She tied it round her waist, outside her dressing-gown,
and would lie by the hour on the sofa with

1294
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,730
the curtains closed and a book in her hand.

1295
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:41,909
But despite her little comforts, Emma did
not become happy.

1296
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:45,559
She had that tight look at the corners of
her mouth which you see in people who have

1297
01:36:45,559 --> 01:36:47,920
failed in their lives.

1298
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:53,639
She was pale, white as a sheet, and she had
an uncertain, hunted look in her eyes.

1299
01:36:53,639 --> 01:37:00,340
And because she had discovered three grey
hairs, she talked about being an old woman.

1300
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:04,880
Also, she had frequent attacks of dizziness.

1301
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:11,940
One day she spat blood and, as Charles rushed
over to her, obviously very anxious, all she

1302
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,999
said was, 'Bah!

1303
01:37:13,999 --> 01:37:16,920
What does it matter?'

1304
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:24,219
Charles went and shut himself in the surgery
and wept.

1305
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:29,690
Although the Bovary household had become a
place of unhappiness again, life in Yonville

1306
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:31,619
continued as usual.

1307
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:36,150
People went to the church on Sundays, and
on Wednesdays the market was held in the town

1308
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,719
square.

1309
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:41,840
From early morning the square filled up with
farmers and people with goods to sell from

1310
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,369
as far as Rouen.

1311
01:37:44,369 --> 01:37:47,679
On Wednesdays the pharmacy never emptied.

1312
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,800
Some came to buy medicine, others to get advice.

1313
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:55,989
Monsieur Homais was a well-known man in all
the villages near Yonville, and they thought

1314
01:37:55,989 --> 01:38:00,199
he knew more about doctoring than all the
doctors put together.

1315
01:38:00,199 --> 01:38:05,099
Emma was seated at her window and was amusing
herself by looking at the crowd of country

1316
01:38:05,099 --> 01:38:09,230
people, when she noticed a gentleman in a
green coat.

1317
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:14,889
He was wearing yellow gloves and heavy, highly
polished brown leather boots, and was making

1318
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:19,150
his way towards the doctor's house, followed
by a farm worker.

1319
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:23,010
'Can I see the doctor?' he asked the maid.

1320
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:29,320
'Tell him Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger of La
Huchette is here.'

1321
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:34,360
Charles came into the room, and Monsieur Boulanger
presented his man, who said he wanted to be

1322
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,260
bled to cure his dizziness.

1323
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:43,159
So Bovary told them to bring him a bandage
and a basin, and asked the maid to hold it.

1324
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:48,849
'Don't be afraid,' he said, turning to the
farm worker, who had gone as white as a sheet.

1325
01:38:48,849 --> 01:38:51,749
'Not me, sir!' he replied.

1326
01:38:51,749 --> 01:38:56,949
And he stuck out a great arm for Charles to
cut, and out shot the blood.

1327
01:38:56,949 --> 01:38:58,110
'Hold the bowl nearer!'

1328
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,739
cried Charles.

1329
01:38:59,739 --> 01:39:02,050
'Look!' said the worker.

1330
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:05,410
'You'd think it was a little fountain.

1331
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:06,410
My blood's red enough!

1332
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:09,570
You'd say that was a good sign now, wouldn't
you?'

1333
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:12,369
'Sometimes they feel nothing to start with.

1334
01:39:12,369 --> 01:39:19,070
Then faintness begins, especially with big,
strong people like this man here,' said Charles

1335
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:20,980
to Monsieur Boulanger.

1336
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:25,030
Hearing this, the man gave a sudden movement
and fell back into the chair.

1337
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:29,949
'I knew it!' said Bovary, putting his finger
on the vein.

1338
01:39:29,949 --> 01:39:34,739
But now the bowl of blood was beginning to
shake in the maid's hands, and she also turned

1339
01:39:34,739 --> 01:39:35,739
pale.

1340
01:39:35,739 --> 01:39:36,739
'Emma!

1341
01:39:36,739 --> 01:39:37,739
Quick!

1342
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:38,739
I want you!'

1343
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:40,449
shouted Charles.

1344
01:39:40,449 --> 01:39:41,829
She ran down the stairs.

1345
01:39:41,829 --> 01:39:44,480
'Get me some vinegar,' he said.

1346
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,510
'Good Lord, two of them at once!'

1347
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:53,090
'It's nothing at all,' said Monsieur Boulanger
calmly, as he took the maid in his arms and

1348
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,579
leaned her against the wall.

1349
01:39:56,579 --> 01:39:58,959
Madame Bovary took hold of the basin.

1350
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:03,900
She bent down to put it under the table, and
as she did so her long yellow dress spread

1351
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,230
out all around her on the floor.

1352
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:12,619
Then, as she stretched out her arm, she swayed
a little and the cloth moved with her, following

1353
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:15,960
the shape of the body beneath it.

1354
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,150
After a moment she went to fetch a jug of
water, and she was putting some pieces of

1355
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:24,119
sugar in it when the pharmacist arrived to
see what was happening.

1356
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:29,400
When things had become calmer, they began
to talk about fainting attacks.

1357
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,940
Madame Bovary said she had never had one herself.

1358
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:36,929
'That's unusual for a woman,' commented Monsieur
Boulanger.

1359
01:40:36,929 --> 01:40:40,310
'But there are some sensitive people around.

1360
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:45,709
I have seen soldiers faint at the sound of
the big guns being prepared.'

1361
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:48,489
Emma listened to him with admiration in her
eyes.

1362
01:40:48,489 --> 01:40:54,500
'Anyway, my man's fainting has given me the
pleasure of meeting Madame,' he added, looking

1363
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:57,320
at Emma as he spoke.

1364
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:01,989
He put down three francs on the corner of
the table, bowed and departed.

1365
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:07,429
He was soon on the other side of the river,
on the road back to La Huchette, and from

1366
01:41:07,429 --> 01:41:12,820
the bedroom window Emma could see him slowing
down from time to time, like someone lost

1367
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:16,340
in thought.

1368
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:19,460
'Pretty little woman, this doctor's wife - very
pretty indeed!

1369
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:23,570
Lovely teeth, dark eyes, neat foot.

1370
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:24,850
She could be a Parisian.

1371
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:30,429
Where does she come from, and where did our
fat country doctor pick her up?'

1372
01:41:30,429 --> 01:41:36,429
Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was a man of thirty-four,
hard-hearted but clever.

1373
01:41:36,429 --> 01:41:41,840
He had plenty of experience with women, and
knew how to get on with them.

1374
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,579
This latest one had attracted his attention.

1375
01:41:44,579 --> 01:41:47,110
'The doctor looks a dull dog to me.

1376
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:49,059
I expect she's sick of him.

1377
01:41:49,059 --> 01:41:52,219
He's got dirty nails and three days' beard.

1378
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:57,360
While he's out seeing his patients, she sits
at home mending socks.

1379
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,780
And she's sick to death of it, wants to live
in town and go to a dance every night.

1380
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,900
Poor little woman!

1381
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,719
She's dying for love.

1382
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:09,360
A word or two about hearts and flowers and
she'd be at your feet.

1383
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,210
But getting rid of her afterwards, that's
where the trouble would come in.'

1384
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:19,420
There was no one around, and the only sounds
Rodolphe heard were the grass brushing against

1385
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:23,880
his boots and the cry of the insects in the
fields.

1386
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:28,699
Once more he imagined Emma, dressed as he
had seen her, and he started to undress her

1387
01:42:28,699 --> 01:42:30,179
in his mind.

1388
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:37,559
'Oh, I'll have her!' he cried, striking out
at the earth with his stick.

1389
01:42:37,559 --> 01:42:44,690
Two weeks later it was the day of the famous
Yonville Agricultural Show, the most important

1390
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:47,250
event of the year.

1391
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:51,530
On the morning of the great day, the inhabitants
were all out on their doorsteps discussing

1392
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:52,530
the arrangements.

1393
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:58,139
The front of the Town Hall had been decorated,
a tent had been put up for the lunch, and

1394
01:42:58,139 --> 01:43:01,600
the whole town was alive with activity.

1395
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:06,030
The crowd poured into the High Street from
both ends of the village.

1396
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:12,530
What caused the greatest admiration were two
tall poles covered with tiny lamps, standing

1397
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:16,929
beside the platform where the most important
guests would sit.

1398
01:43:16,929 --> 01:43:22,039
Madame Lefrancois, the landlady of the Lion
d'Or, and Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist,

1399
01:43:22,039 --> 01:43:26,980
stood on the steps of the hotel watching the
growing crowd and the men going in and out

1400
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:31,499
of the Cafe de France - the main competition
to the Lion d'Or.

1401
01:43:31,499 --> 01:43:35,489
'Well, that won't last much longer,' she said.

1402
01:43:35,489 --> 01:43:38,840
'One more week and that will be the end of
it.'

1403
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:41,800
Homais looked at her in surpise.

1404
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,410
She walked down her three steps.

1405
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:45,650
'What!'

1406
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,610
she said, speaking into his ear.

1407
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:49,599
'Didn't you know?

1408
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:53,130
They're going to have to close down and move
this week.

1409
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:57,459
It's Lheureux that's making them do it, he's
got them so deep into debt!'

1410
01:43:57,459 --> 01:44:02,659
And Madame Lefrancois began to tell Monsieur
Homais how the draper had lent the owners

1411
01:44:02,659 --> 01:44:07,690
of the Cafe de France more money than they
could ever pay back, and now they were having

1412
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:09,429
to sell everything.

1413
01:44:09,429 --> 01:44:10,429
'Look!'

1414
01:44:10,429 --> 01:44:11,429
she said.

1415
01:44:11,429 --> 01:44:14,460
'There he is, Lheureux - over there, in the
market.

1416
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,460
Look!

1417
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,830
He's bowing to Madame Bovary.

1418
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:17,830
Do look!

1419
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:19,570
She's got a green hat on.

1420
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:20,880
Do you see her?

1421
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,559
She's leaning on Monsieur Boulanger's arm.'

1422
01:44:23,559 --> 01:44:26,540
'Madame Bovary!' said Homais.

1423
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:30,389
'Oh, I must go over and say how do you do
to her!

1424
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,650
She might like to have a seat on the platform.'

1425
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:38,400
Rodolphe saw him coming and walked more quickly
but then, as Madame Bovary was getting out

1426
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,209
of breath, he slowed down.

1427
01:44:41,209 --> 01:44:49,050
'I wanted to avoid that fool - you know, that
chemist fellow,' he said to her with a laugh.

1428
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,809
Emma smiled at him.

1429
01:44:50,809 --> 01:44:54,739
'What does that smile mean?' he wondered.

1430
01:44:54,739 --> 01:44:57,080
'Is she making fun of me?'

1431
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:03,090
And he looked at her out of the corner of
his eye as they walked on more quickly.

1432
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:08,090
When they reached the corner, Rodolphe, instead
of going right into the square, suddenly turned

1433
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:10,350
down a side-path, dragging Emma with him.

1434
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:12,090
'Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux,' he called
out.

1435
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:13,090
'See you later.'

1436
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:20,139
'You did that very well!' said Emma, laughing.

1437
01:45:20,139 --> 01:45:22,550
'Why should I let these people bother me?

1438
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:28,559
And today of all days, when I have the luck
to be with you...'

1439
01:45:28,559 --> 01:45:29,559
Emma blushed.

1440
01:45:29,559 --> 01:45:31,800
He did not finish his sentence.

1441
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:36,889
Then he remarked on the fine weather, and
said how nice it was to walk on the grass

1442
01:45:36,889 --> 01:45:40,219
where small yellow flowers had sprung up.

1443
01:45:40,219 --> 01:45:46,139
'Look,' he said, 'young girls in love use
these to see if they are loved.

1444
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:48,110
Suppose I picked one of these.

1445
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:51,380
What do you think it would tell me?'

1446
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:53,679
'Are you in love?'

1447
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:55,570
she said, with a little cough.

1448
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:56,570
'Ah!

1449
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:57,639
Who knows?'

1450
01:45:57,639 --> 01:45:59,030
answered Rodolphe.

1451
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:05,770
The market square and the fields around continued
to fill up with people.

1452
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:10,929
The judging was now going on and the farmers,
lined up one after another, were all crowding

1453
01:46:10,929 --> 01:46:11,929
into a ring.

1454
01:46:11,929 --> 01:46:15,699
There were the farm animals in a long, irregular
line.

1455
01:46:15,699 --> 01:46:21,409
Among the sleepy pigs and cows, bare-armed
men were holding on to great male horses which

1456
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:25,639
pulled with all their strength in the direction
of the females.

1457
01:46:25,639 --> 01:46:31,980
These stood quite still, holding their heads
down, while their young rested in their shadows.

1458
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:38,730
By now, Emma and Monsieur Boulanger had come
round to the field.

1459
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:42,929
They discussed the people they saw, how Paris
was so much more interesting than a place

1460
01:46:42,929 --> 01:46:47,869
like Yonville, and they laughed at the fashions
of the farmers' wives.

1461
01:46:47,869 --> 01:46:52,229
'But anyway,' he said, 'when you live in the
country -'

1462
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:55,210
'What's the point of looking good?'

1463
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:58,130
'I agree,' answered Rodolphe.

1464
01:46:58,130 --> 01:47:03,372
'Not one of these people knows when a coat
is well cut and when it isn't.'

1465
01:47:03,372 --> 01:47:07,239
And they agreed that life away from town was
hardly worth living.

1466
01:47:07,239 --> 01:47:13,230
'Which is why,' said Rodolphe, 'I am so sad
at times.'

1467
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:14,230
'You!'

1468
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:15,380
she broke in with amazement.

1469
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:18,920
'I thought you had nothing to worry about!'

1470
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:26,420
'Ah, yes, it seems so, but we cannot always
show the world who we really are, our true

1471
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:27,420
selves.

1472
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:31,969
Whenever I look at a cemetery by moonlight,
I ask myself if I wouldn't be happier lying

1473
01:47:31,969 --> 01:47:34,369
there asleep with the rest of them.'

1474
01:47:34,369 --> 01:47:37,610
'But what about your friends?

1475
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:39,440
You don't think of them.'

1476
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,229
'My friends?

1477
01:47:41,229 --> 01:47:42,229
What friends?

1478
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:43,440
What friends have I got?

1479
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,449
Who cares about me?'

1480
01:47:46,449 --> 01:47:51,570
So they walked on arm in arm, ignoring the
arrival of the guests of honour, Emma leaning

1481
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:55,249
against this strong man with such pain in
his heart.

1482
01:47:55,249 --> 01:48:01,360
As the crowd gathered to hear the speeches,
Rodolphe, accompanied by Madame Bovary, went

1483
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,409
up on to the first floor of the Town Hall
into the empty council meeting room.

1484
01:48:06,409 --> 01:48:14,250
He fetched two chairs and, bringing them close
up to the window, they sat down side by side.

1485
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:19,250
As soon as the speeches began, people quietened
down a little, and Emma leaned forward to

1486
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:20,250
see better.

1487
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:24,690
'I'd better get a bit farther back,' said
Rodolphe.

1488
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:25,690
'Why?'

1489
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:27,130
asked Emma.

1490
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:29,429
'They might see me from down below.

1491
01:48:29,429 --> 01:48:34,239
And then I would have to give explanations
for at least a fortnight, and with my reputation...'

1492
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:39,420
'Oh, you're making yourself sound much worse
than you are,' said Emma.

1493
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:42,999
'No, no; it's horrible, I tell you!'

1494
01:48:42,999 --> 01:48:48,160
The voice of the next speaker went on like
an angry insect in the hot sun.

1495
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:52,829
'But,' added Rodolphe, 'the world may be right.'

1496
01:48:52,829 --> 01:48:55,099
'What do you mean?'

1497
01:48:55,099 --> 01:48:56,510
she asked.

1498
01:48:56,510 --> 01:49:02,400
'Well,' he said, 'don't you know that there
are some people who are never at peace; people

1499
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:10,010
who desire dreams and action, the wildest
pleasures - but after passion comes regret!'

1500
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:14,639
She looked at him as if he were a traveller
who has journeyed through strange and far-off

1501
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:15,639
lands.

1502
01:49:15,639 --> 01:49:22,999
'We poor women, we never have such good reasons
for regret,' she said.

1503
01:49:22,999 --> 01:49:28,939
'Ah, but to behave as badly as I have does
not make you any happier!'

1504
01:49:28,939 --> 01:49:32,409
'But does one ever find happiness?'

1505
01:49:32,409 --> 01:49:36,059
'Yes, one day,' he replied.

1506
01:49:36,059 --> 01:49:43,769
The speaker continued to praise the farmers,
their animals and their rich fields.

1507
01:49:43,769 --> 01:49:49,699
Some listened and some began to sleep in their
seats, heads falling forward in the summer

1508
01:49:49,699 --> 01:49:50,749
heat.

1509
01:49:50,749 --> 01:49:57,030
'Yes,' said Rodolphe, 'you don't have to think
about it; one day you meet someone, and the

1510
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:59,050
horizon opens up in front of you.

1511
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,699
There are no more questions.

1512
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:04,650
It's as if you have already met one another
in your dreams.'

1513
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,909
(Here he looked at Emma.)

1514
01:50:06,909 --> 01:50:13,130
'There in front of you is the jewel you have
been looking for; there before your eyes.

1515
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:18,159
Nevertheless, you dare not believe it; you
cannot see clearly, it is as if you had just

1516
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:22,139
stepped out of the darkness into the light.'

1517
01:50:22,139 --> 01:50:28,530
And as he said this, Rodolphe passed his hand
over his face, then he let it fall on Emma's,

1518
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:31,099
who took hers away.

1519
01:50:31,099 --> 01:50:36,170
Still the speaker read on, praising those
who did their duty on the land.

1520
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:39,520
'Ah, there he goes again!' said Rodolphe.

1521
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,599
'Duty, duty - always duty!

1522
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,599
I'm sick to death of the word!

1523
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:47,429
We must follow our hearts - that is our true
duty!'

1524
01:50:47,429 --> 01:50:54,650
'Yes, but - but -' said Madame Bovary, 'don't
you also think we must follow the laws of

1525
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:55,650
society?'

1526
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:56,650
'Ah!

1527
01:50:56,650 --> 01:51:00,510
But there are two laws,' he replied.

1528
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:06,640
'There is the little, unimportant man-made
law, always changing, made by fools like that

1529
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,620
one down there.

1530
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:14,559
And there is the other, which never changes
and is all around us, like the countryside

1531
01:51:14,559 --> 01:51:19,489
and the blue heavens that give us light.'

1532
01:51:19,489 --> 01:51:22,360
The whole square was now crowded with people.

1533
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:26,959
They could be seen leaning on their elbows
at every window, others standing at their

1534
01:51:26,959 --> 01:51:27,959
doors.

1535
01:51:27,959 --> 01:51:32,239
In spite of the silence, the speaker's voice
was lost in the air.

1536
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:39,139
It rose in broken phrases, interrupted here
and there by the sound of chairs on the stones.

1537
01:51:39,139 --> 01:51:46,599
Rodolphe had moved nearer to Emma, and said
to her in a low voice, speaking rapidly, 'Don't

1538
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:48,780
society's demands disgust you?

1539
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:54,300
The best feelings, the purest thoughts are
attacked, controlled, and if at last two souls

1540
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,280
do meet, they cannot unite.

1541
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:59,469
They will try, they will call out to each
other.

1542
01:51:59,469 --> 01:52:06,610
But sooner or later - in six months, ten years
- they will come together, they will love;

1543
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:09,939
they are born for each other.'

1544
01:52:09,939 --> 01:52:14,989
Lifting his face towards Emma, he looked closely
at her.

1545
01:52:14,989 --> 01:52:20,210
She noticed in his eyes small golden lines
coming from the dark centre, she smelt the

1546
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:25,729
perfume on his hair, and she half closed her
eyes to breathe it in.

1547
01:52:25,729 --> 01:52:31,189
She took off her gloves, she wiped her hands,
then tried to cool her face with her handkerchief.

1548
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:36,159
Through the sound of her blood beating in
her ears, she heard the sound of the crowd

1549
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:42,170
and the voice of the speaker telling them
to work harder, to be good citizens.

1550
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:46,739
Now Rodolphe took her hand and she did not
take it away.

1551
01:52:46,739 --> 01:52:51,150
As the names of the prize winners in the show
were read out below, he told her he had never

1552
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:55,780
loved anyone before her, and he would love
her for the rest of his life.

1553
01:52:55,780 --> 01:53:02,599
He pressed her hand, and felt its warmth and
life - like a bird held for a moment, perhaps

1554
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:05,250
trying to escape, perhaps responding.

1555
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:09,420
'Oh, thank you, thank you!' he cried.

1556
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:11,630
'You do not reject me.

1557
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:14,099
How sweet you are!

1558
01:53:14,099 --> 01:53:17,070
You know that I am yours.'

1559
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:22,739
Suddenly the wind rose, shaking the curtains
and causing the peasant women in the square

1560
01:53:22,739 --> 01:53:25,860
to hold on to the wings of their white hats.

1561
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:30,870
The speaker began to speak more quickly, more
enthusiastically, but neither Rodolphe nor

1562
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,219
Emma were listening.

1563
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:35,369
They sat and looked into each other's eyes.

1564
01:53:35,369 --> 01:53:42,030
Their lips were dry, their bodies full of
desire, and Emma no longer felt a need to

1565
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:43,030
resist.

1566
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:47,530
Down in the square the speakers continued,
the prizes were given.

1567
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:52,070
The celebrations would be over soon.

1568
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:56,269
Madame Bovary took Rodolphe's arm, and he
walked with her back to her house.

1569
01:53:56,269 --> 01:54:01,130
They said goodbye at her front door, after
which he went and walked in the fields near

1570
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:04,590
the river.

1571
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:09,909
CHAPTER TEN
Presents for a Lover

1572
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:13,519
Six weeks went by, and Rodolphe did not contact
Emma.

1573
01:54:13,519 --> 01:54:16,920
'I must not go back too soon,' he had said
to himself.

1574
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:21,039
'It would be a mistake.'

1575
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:23,770
The week after the show, he went off shooting.

1576
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:28,659
When the hunting was over he wondered if he
had left it too long, but then he thought

1577
01:54:28,659 --> 01:54:34,630
to himself, 'If she loved me from the first
day, by now she will love me even more.

1578
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:38,170
I will let her wait.'

1579
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:45,239
When he saw how pale she became when he entered
the room, he knew he had made the right decision.

1580
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:47,780
She was alone and it was getting dark.

1581
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:54,030
Rodolphe remained standing, and Emma was barely
able to answer his first greeting.

1582
01:54:54,030 --> 01:54:56,429
'I've been busy,' he said.

1583
01:54:56,429 --> 01:54:58,590
'I haven't been well.'

1584
01:54:58,590 --> 01:55:00,489
'Nothing serious?'

1585
01:55:00,489 --> 01:55:01,540
she asked quickly.

1586
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:06,309
'Oh, well, no,' said Rodolphe, sitting down.

1587
01:55:06,309 --> 01:55:08,159
'I didn't want to come here again.'

1588
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:09,820
'Why?'

1589
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:14,809
'Can't you guess?'

1590
01:55:14,809 --> 01:55:20,780
He looked at her again, but with such a look
of love that she lowered her eyes with a blush.

1591
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:24,150
'Emma!' he began again.

1592
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,690
'Sir!'

1593
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:28,909
she cried, moving back a little.

1594
01:55:28,909 --> 01:55:30,030
'Ah!

1595
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:36,699
You see perfectly well now that I was right
not to return,' he said sadly, 'but I have

1596
01:55:36,699 --> 01:55:41,699
been thinking of you; thinking and thinking
till I've become almost mad.

1597
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:43,670
Ah, forgive me!

1598
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:48,329
I'll go away - far away - and you will never
hear of me again.

1599
01:55:48,329 --> 01:55:55,479
But today, somehow, it seemed that something,
I don't know what, made me come to you.

1600
01:55:55,479 --> 01:56:03,499
Who can help falling in love with someone
who is so beautiful, so charming?'

1601
01:56:03,499 --> 01:56:08,260
It was the first time in her life Emma had
heard such words.

1602
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:11,409
She turned towards him with tears in her eyes.

1603
01:56:11,409 --> 01:56:15,449
'Oh, how kind you are!'

1604
01:56:15,449 --> 01:56:16,499
she said.

1605
01:56:16,499 --> 01:56:22,659
'No,' he said, 'I love you, that's all.

1606
01:56:22,659 --> 01:56:24,920
You know I do, don't you?

1607
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:29,900
Tell me you know it - just one word, one little
word!'

1608
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,469
And Rodolphe began to go down on his knees.

1609
01:56:32,469 --> 01:56:37,820
But there was a noise of someone moving around
in the kitchen, and he noticed that the door

1610
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:39,489
was not closed.

1611
01:56:39,489 --> 01:56:45,280
'It would be so kind of you,' he said, getting
up, 'if you could let me see your house.

1612
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,360
It's such a charming place.'

1613
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:52,929
Madame Bovary said she would be happy to do
this, and they were just getting up when Charles

1614
01:56:52,929 --> 01:56:54,070
came in.

1615
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:57,610
'Good morning, Doctor,' said Rodolphe.

1616
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:02,080
'Madame,' he continued, 'was talking to me
about her health.

1617
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:06,530
I was saying that a little horse riding might
be a good thing.'

1618
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:09,469
'An excellent idea...

1619
01:57:09,469 --> 01:57:12,360
You should do that, darling.'

1620
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:17,679
When she replied that she had no horse, Monsieur
Rodolphe offered to lend her one.

1621
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:21,040
She refused, and he did not insist.

1622
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,820
And that was the end of the visit.

1623
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:27,139
'Why didn't you accept Monsieur Boulanger's
offer?

1624
01:57:27,139 --> 01:57:32,300
It was very good of him,' said Charles when
they were alone.

1625
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:35,350
She said that perhaps people would think it
rather odd.

1626
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:39,039
'Well, who cares about that?' said Charles.

1627
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:40,800
'Health, that's the main thing.

1628
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,990
It was silly of you.'

1629
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:47,739
'And how do you expect me to go riding when
I haven't got the right clothes?'

1630
01:57:47,739 --> 01:57:52,449
'We will get you some,' he replied.

1631
01:57:52,449 --> 01:57:59,059
The promise of new clothes was enough to make
Emma change her mind.

1632
01:57:59,059 --> 01:58:03,840
When Emma's riding clothes were ready, Charles
wrote to Monsieur Boulanger saying that his

1633
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:10,199
wife could go any time, and that they were
grateful for his kind offer.

1634
01:58:10,199 --> 01:58:14,380
Next day, Rodolphe appeared at Charles's door
with two horses.

1635
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:20,489
He had put on a pair of new riding-boots,
telling himself that she had certainly never

1636
01:58:20,489 --> 01:58:28,030
seen anything like them before, and Emma was
charmed with the way he looked.

1637
01:58:28,030 --> 01:58:33,360
As soon as he felt the grass under him, Emma's
horse started to move more quickly, and Rodolphe

1638
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,880
came along beside her.

1639
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,780
Every now and then they exchanged a word or
two.

1640
01:58:38,780 --> 01:58:44,409
She rode with her head a little forward, her
hand well up and her right arm stretched out,

1641
01:58:44,409 --> 01:58:47,329
and she let herself follow the movements of
the horse.

1642
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:53,400
They rode on like this for fifteen or twenty
minutes until, at the top of a small hill,

1643
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:57,170
the horses stopped.

1644
01:58:57,170 --> 01:59:02,809
It was early in October, and a thin mist was
spread over the land.

1645
01:59:02,809 --> 01:59:06,820
Sometimes the sun would shine through a break
in the clouds and light up the distant roofs

1646
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:13,320
of Yonville, with the gardens near the water,
the yards, the walls and the church.

1647
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:18,920
Emma half closed her eyes to see her house,
and never had this poor village in which she

1648
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:23,940
lived seemed so small.

1649
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:29,599
After a moment, Rodolphe and Emma turned off
and rode along the edge of the wood.

1650
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:34,070
She turned away her head every now and again
to avoid his eyes, and saw only the trunks

1651
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:35,380
of the trees.

1652
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:39,170
Just as they entered the wood, the sun came
out.

1653
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:43,079
'God is with us!' said Rodolphe.

1654
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:44,810
'You think so?'

1655
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:46,679
she answered.

1656
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:47,679
'Come on!

1657
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:48,830
Come on!'

1658
01:59:48,830 --> 01:59:52,809
was his reply.

1659
01:59:52,809 --> 01:59:57,139
The path narrowed as they went into the wood,
and sometimes, to keep away the branches,

1660
01:59:57,139 --> 02:00:01,099
he rode close up to her and Emma felt his
knee rubbing against her leg.

1661
02:00:01,099 --> 02:00:05,489
The sky was blue now, and not a leaf moved.

1662
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:10,780
They got down from their horses and Emma walked
a little further down the path.

1663
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:16,630
Rodolphe came up behind her, stretched out
his arm and put it round her waist.

1664
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:21,679
She made an effort to break away, but he continued
to hold her, so she turned and walked back

1665
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,340
towards where they had stopped.

1666
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,929
'Oh, stay!' said Rodolphe.

1667
02:00:25,929 --> 02:00:28,409
'We must not go yet!

1668
02:00:28,409 --> 02:00:29,409
Stay!'

1669
02:00:29,409 --> 02:00:35,249
And he took her to a little pool, whose surface
was covered with small green water plants.

1670
02:00:35,249 --> 02:00:37,889
'It is wrong of me!

1671
02:00:37,889 --> 02:00:38,949
Wrong, wrong!'

1672
02:00:38,949 --> 02:00:39,949
she cried.

1673
02:00:39,949 --> 02:00:44,479
'I am mad to listen to you.'

1674
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:45,479
'Why?

1675
02:00:45,479 --> 02:00:46,479
Emma!

1676
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:47,479
Emma!'

1677
02:00:47,479 --> 02:00:48,479
'Oh, Rodolphe!'

1678
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:52,179
she cried, dropping her head against his shoulder.

1679
02:00:52,179 --> 02:00:58,059
With a deep sigh she threw back her head,
giving her white neck to his kisses and, almost

1680
02:00:58,059 --> 02:01:04,189
fainting, in tears, her whole body shaking
with emotion, hiding her face in her hands,

1681
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:08,869
she surrendered herself to him.

1682
02:01:08,869 --> 02:01:15,080
When evening began to fall the sun, shining
through the branches, was bright in her eyes.

1683
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:18,780
Everywhere was silence.

1684
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:23,560
She could feel her heart as it began to beat
again, she could feel the blood moving through

1685
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:26,209
her body like a stream of milk.

1686
02:01:26,209 --> 02:01:32,059
And then, far, far away, beyond the wood,
on the hills across the valley, she heard

1687
02:01:32,059 --> 02:01:39,890
a cry, strange and distant, a voice that hung
in the air, and she listened to it in silence.

1688
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:44,929
Rodolphe was standing with a cigar between
his teeth, cleaning his fingernails with a

1689
02:01:44,929 --> 02:01:46,320
small knife.

1690
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:50,959
They returned to Yonville by the way they
had come.

1691
02:01:50,959 --> 02:01:56,449
They saw the tracks of their horses in the
soil, side by side, and there were the same

1692
02:01:56,449 --> 02:01:58,989
bushes and the same stones in the grass.

1693
02:01:58,989 --> 02:02:05,860
Nothing about them had changed, but for her
something had happened, something more surprising

1694
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:09,300
than if the mountains had fallen into the
sea.

1695
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:15,360
When she was alone in her room after dinner,
she looked at herself in the mirror and was

1696
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:16,989
amazed at her own face.

1697
02:02:16,989 --> 02:02:24,070
Never had her eyes looked so big, so dark,
so deep.

1698
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:26,499
It was as if she had become another woman.

1699
02:02:26,499 --> 02:02:37,709
And she kept saying to herself over and over
again, 'I have a lover, a lover.'

1700
02:02:37,709 --> 02:02:42,550
From that first day they wrote to each other
every night.

1701
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:46,829
Emma took her letter to the end of the garden
near the river and put it in a gap in the

1702
02:02:46,829 --> 02:02:47,829
wall.

1703
02:02:47,829 --> 02:02:53,090
Rodolphe would come and take it and put another
in its place, and always she complained that

1704
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:54,800
his letters were too short.

1705
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:01,190
The time she had with him was too short too,
so whenever Charles was called out early,

1706
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:07,099
Emma got up, threw on some clothes and ran
through the fields to Rodolphe's house.

1707
02:03:07,099 --> 02:03:11,979
At this early hour Rodolphe would still be
asleep, and Emma seemed like a spring morning

1708
02:03:11,979 --> 02:03:13,980
coming into his room.

1709
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:19,349
Laughing, he would pull her towards him and
down on to his breast, and afterwards it would

1710
02:03:19,349 --> 02:03:23,039
take them a quarter of an hour to say goodbye.

1711
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:27,249
Emma would burst out crying; she would have
liked to stay with Rodolphe always and never

1712
02:03:27,249 --> 02:03:29,060
leave him any more.

1713
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:35,630
But one day, when she came in unexpectedly,
a look of annoyance passed over his face.

1714
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:38,039
'What's the matter?'

1715
02:03:38,039 --> 02:03:39,039
she said.

1716
02:03:39,039 --> 02:03:41,119
'Don't you feel well?

1717
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:42,119
Tell me!'

1718
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:48,150
At first he said nothing, but then, looking
very serious about it, he told her that he

1719
02:03:48,150 --> 02:03:50,809
was worried about these early morning visits.

1720
02:03:50,809 --> 02:03:53,189
People would start talking about her.

1721
02:03:53,189 --> 02:03:56,090
They needed another meeting place.

1722
02:03:56,090 --> 02:04:01,499
Rodolphe said he would look out for a house
outside Yonville where they could be together,

1723
02:04:01,499 --> 02:04:06,539
but all through the winter, three or four
times a week, and when it was quite dark,

1724
02:04:06,539 --> 02:04:09,959
the only place they could find was Emma's
garden.

1725
02:04:09,959 --> 02:04:13,829
They would come together there after Charles
had gone to sleep.

1726
02:04:13,829 --> 02:04:19,060
The cold made them hold each other tighter;
their eyes, though they could hardly see them

1727
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:22,449
in the growing darkness, seemed bigger.

1728
02:04:22,449 --> 02:04:25,780
On wet nights they would take shelter in the
surgery.

1729
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:30,869
She would light one of the kitchen candles
and Rodolphe made himself quite at home.

1730
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:35,980
The sight of the bookcase and the desk - everything
in the room, in fact - seemed to amuse him,

1731
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:40,469
and he could not stop himself from making
all sorts of little jokes about Charles.

1732
02:04:40,469 --> 02:04:43,030
This did not please Emma.

1733
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:47,239
She would have liked him to be a little more
serious, a little more dramatic.

1734
02:04:47,239 --> 02:04:53,579
But Rodolphe felt no need to change his ways
and was, in fact, becoming a little bored

1735
02:04:53,579 --> 02:04:56,999
with Emma's delicate emotions and sensitivities.

1736
02:04:56,999 --> 02:05:03,520
She even talked about wanting a ring - a proper
wedding ring - as a symbol of their union.

1737
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:08,599
He never spoke to her now as he used to, saying
the sweet, tender things that had made her

1738
02:05:08,599 --> 02:05:10,570
cry with happiness.

1739
02:05:10,570 --> 02:05:13,840
He never kissed her and held her in the old
way.

1740
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,869
No!

1741
02:05:14,869 --> 02:05:21,239
That great love of theirs, on whose waves
she had been carried away, seemed to be growing

1742
02:05:21,239 --> 02:05:27,199
shallower beneath her, like the waters of
a river in a dry summer, and now she could

1743
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:31,300
see the mud that lay beneath it!

1744
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:36,420
As Emma grew to understand that this great
love affair might not be for ever, Rodolphe

1745
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:41,690
found her becoming more and more distant,
even cooler towards him.

1746
02:05:41,690 --> 02:05:46,560
For a few weeks she even spent more time with
Charles, trying to see if she could love him

1747
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,560
better.

1748
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:53,610
But it was no use, and Rodolphe thought to
himself, 'She'll get over it.

1749
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:56,889
It's just one of her little ways.'

1750
02:05:56,889 --> 02:05:58,079
He was right.

1751
02:05:58,079 --> 02:06:03,429
All he had to do was to keep away, to miss
their meeting for three or four nights, and

1752
02:06:03,429 --> 02:06:09,480
once again her complaints stopped and she
was his!

1753
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:11,669
So love began for them again.

1754
02:06:11,669 --> 02:06:17,239
Often, in the middle of the day, Emma would
take up a pen and write to him.

1755
02:06:17,239 --> 02:06:22,530
And she did not only send letters, but also
presents, small expensive things that she

1756
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:26,929
could not afford, and which she could not
ask her husband to buy.

1757
02:06:26,929 --> 02:06:32,729
It was Monsieur Lheureux, the draper, who
was able to help her here.

1758
02:06:32,729 --> 02:06:37,209
As soon as he heard that Madame Bovary was
buying gifts for someone, he made sure he

1759
02:06:37,209 --> 02:06:39,380
met her as often as he could.

1760
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:45,820
He told her all about the latest deliveries
from Paris, was very helpful and never asked

1761
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,860
for his money.

1762
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:53,080
Emma found this a very easy way to satisfy
her wish to please her lover, and she took

1763
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:54,960
full advantage of it.

1764
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,570
For example, she wanted to buy Rodolphe a
very handsome riding whip that was on show

1765
02:06:59,570 --> 02:07:01,709
at an umbrella shop in Rouen.

1766
02:07:01,709 --> 02:07:06,909
And next week, there was Monsieur Lheureux
putting it on her dining room table.

1767
02:07:06,909 --> 02:07:13,919
But the day after that, he came along with
a bill for two hundred and seventy francs!

1768
02:07:13,919 --> 02:07:15,800
Emma did not know what to do.

1769
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:19,050
All the drawers in the desk had been emptied
out.

1770
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:24,389
She owed wages to the servants, and Bovary
was anxiously waiting for a payment from Monsieur

1771
02:07:24,389 --> 02:07:30,389
Derozerays, who, in previous years, had always
paid his doctor's bill some time in July.

1772
02:07:30,389 --> 02:07:36,099
At first she managed to get rid of Lheureux,
but in the end he lost patience.

1773
02:07:36,099 --> 02:07:41,219
He had to pay his bills, other people were
asking him for the money!

1774
02:07:41,219 --> 02:07:44,620
He would be forced to ask her to return the
goods.

1775
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:48,530
'Very well, take them,' said Emma.

1776
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:52,059
'Oh, I was only joking!' he replied.

1777
02:07:52,059 --> 02:07:56,050
'The only thing that worries me is the riding
whip.

1778
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:57,050
I know!

1779
02:07:57,050 --> 02:07:59,059
I'll ask the doctor to let me have it back.'

1780
02:07:59,059 --> 02:08:01,639
'No, don't!'

1781
02:08:01,639 --> 02:08:02,719
she cried out.

1782
02:08:02,719 --> 02:08:05,659
'Aha, I've got you!'

1783
02:08:05,659 --> 02:08:08,460
thought Lheureux to himself.

1784
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:14,699
And, sure of being on the right track, he
went out, saying under his breath, 'Right!

1785
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:20,829
We shall see, we shall see!'

1786
02:08:20,829 --> 02:08:25,090
She was wondering how she was going to get
out of this difficulty when the maid came

1787
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:30,679
in and put a little packet on the table, 'From
Monsieur Derozerays.'

1788
02:08:30,679 --> 02:08:32,889
Emma took the envelope and tore it open.

1789
02:08:32,889 --> 02:08:36,560
It was enough money to pay her debts!

1790
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:41,169
She heard Charles coming up the stairs and,
without thinking, she threw the money to the

1791
02:08:41,169 --> 02:08:46,719
back of the drawer, locked it, and took out
the key.

1792
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:49,679
Three days later Lheureux reappeared.

1793
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:53,269
'I want to suggest an arrangement,' he said.

1794
02:08:53,269 --> 02:08:56,360
'If, instead of the sum agreed, you would...'

1795
02:08:56,360 --> 02:09:01,130
'There you are,' said she, putting the four
hundred francs in his hand.

1796
02:09:01,130 --> 02:09:05,419
She was safe for the moment, but what would
happen next time?

1797
02:09:05,419 --> 02:09:08,769
What could she do to escape?

1798
02:09:08,769 --> 02:09:12,479
Her dream now was to go away with Rodolphe.

1799
02:09:12,479 --> 02:09:17,459
One night when they met in the garden, and
she was at her saddest and most beautiful,

1800
02:09:17,459 --> 02:09:22,169
he asked her what he could do to help her,
to bring back the smile to her face.

1801
02:09:22,169 --> 02:09:24,749
'What must we do?

1802
02:09:24,749 --> 02:09:26,010
What do you want?'

1803
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:28,289
'Take me away!'

1804
02:09:28,289 --> 02:09:29,289
she cried.

1805
02:09:29,289 --> 02:09:32,169
'Take me from here...

1806
02:09:32,169 --> 02:09:35,229
Oh, I beg you!'

1807
02:09:35,229 --> 02:09:36,229
'But...'

1808
02:09:36,229 --> 02:09:37,530
Rodolphe began.

1809
02:09:37,530 --> 02:09:38,530
'Yes?'

1810
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:41,860
'What about your little girl?'

1811
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:46,409
She thought a minute or two and then answered,
'We'll take her with us.

1812
02:09:46,409 --> 02:09:48,469
It's the only thing to do.'

1813
02:09:48,469 --> 02:09:55,039
'What a woman!' he said to himself, as he
saw her disappear.

1814
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:56,320
Someone was calling.

1815
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:02,289
But now Emma believed that she would be able
to escape, and this became her only topic

1816
02:10:02,289 --> 02:10:04,940
of conversation with Rodolphe.

1817
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:10,519
She would lean her head on his shoulder and
whisper, 'Ah, when we are in the coach!

1818
02:10:10,519 --> 02:10:11,800
Can you imagine it?

1819
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,619
Is it possible?

1820
02:10:13,619 --> 02:10:18,729
It seems to me that the moment I feel it moving,
it will be as if we were going up in a balloon,

1821
02:10:18,729 --> 02:10:20,699
as if we were going to the clouds.

1822
02:10:20,699 --> 02:10:25,820
Do you know, I'm counting the days!

1823
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:27,510
Aren't you?'

1824
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:31,289
Never had Madame Bovary looked so beautiful
as now.

1825
02:10:31,289 --> 02:10:35,309
Charles thought her as delicious as on the
day she became his bride.

1826
02:10:35,309 --> 02:10:40,280
When he came home late at night, he did not
dare to wake her.

1827
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:45,900
The night-lamp threw a ring of light on the
ceiling as she lay sleeping beside her daughter.

1828
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:51,139
Charles would stand and look at them, dreaming
of the future, of his beautiful wife and his

1829
02:10:51,139 --> 02:10:53,039
growing child.

1830
02:10:53,039 --> 02:11:00,489
But he was not in Emma's dreams; she was heading
for a new land in a coach pulled by four white

1831
02:11:00,489 --> 02:11:05,199
horses and with her lover by her side.

1832
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:09,849
She was so certain she would be leaving that
she sent for Monsieur Lheureux and ordered

1833
02:11:09,849 --> 02:11:13,960
a heavy travelling coat and a travelling case.

1834
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:17,829
She told him to keep the things at the shop
when they arrived, and she would collect them

1835
02:11:17,829 --> 02:11:19,949
in a week or two.

1836
02:11:19,949 --> 02:11:24,059
It was, in fact, the following month that
they were going to run away.

1837
02:11:24,059 --> 02:11:28,249
She would leave Yonville as if she were going
shopping in Rouen.

1838
02:11:28,249 --> 02:11:32,499
Rodolphe would have booked the seats, arranged
the passports, and written to Paris in order

1839
02:11:32,499 --> 02:11:36,630
to have the mail coach all to themselves as
far as Marseilles.

1840
02:11:36,630 --> 02:11:40,909
There they would buy a carriage and go right
through to Genoa.

1841
02:11:40,909 --> 02:11:48,989
In all this planning the child was never mentioned,
and Rodolphe avoided any reference to her;

1842
02:11:48,989 --> 02:11:52,499
perhaps Emma had given up the idea of taking
her.

1843
02:11:52,499 --> 02:12:00,119
However, Rodolphe then found he needed a fortnight
to complete certain business matters; then,

1844
02:12:00,119 --> 02:12:03,630
after a week, he needed another fortnight.

1845
02:12:03,630 --> 02:12:08,380
Then he found he was not feeling very well
so there was another delay, and then he went

1846
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:10,269
away on a journey.

1847
02:12:10,269 --> 02:12:16,260
The whole of August went by and finally, after
all these delays, the date of their departure

1848
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:21,840
was fixed for 4 September, a Monday.

1849
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:27,969
On the evening of their last Saturday in Yonville,
Rodolphe came to see her earlier than usual.

1850
02:12:27,969 --> 02:12:29,820
'Is everything ready?'

1851
02:12:29,820 --> 02:12:30,840
she asked.

1852
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:31,840
'Yes.'

1853
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,230
'You're sad,' said Emma.

1854
02:12:35,230 --> 02:12:36,230
'No.

1855
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:37,230
Why?'

1856
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:40,709
'Is it because you are going away?'

1857
02:12:40,709 --> 02:12:41,709
she went on.

1858
02:12:41,709 --> 02:12:45,269
'Leaving the things you love, the things that
have been your life?

1859
02:12:45,269 --> 02:12:47,650
Ah, I understand!

1860
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:51,650
But I, I have nothing in the world!

1861
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:53,889
You are everything to me.

1862
02:12:53,889 --> 02:12:57,019
And so I shall be everything to you.'

1863
02:12:57,019 --> 02:13:01,219
'Oh, what a lovely night!' said Rodolphe.

1864
02:13:01,219 --> 02:13:05,929
'We shall have many more nights together,'
she answered.

1865
02:13:05,929 --> 02:13:10,939
And then, as if speaking to herself, she went
on, 'Yes, it will be good to travel.

1866
02:13:10,939 --> 02:13:13,520
But why is my heart so sad?

1867
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,169
Is it fear of the unknown... or the break
with all I have been used to?

1868
02:13:18,169 --> 02:13:19,489
Or else...?

1869
02:13:19,489 --> 02:13:24,059
No, it is because I am too happy in my happiness!

1870
02:13:24,059 --> 02:13:25,920
How weak I am!

1871
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,539
Forgive me!'

1872
02:13:27,539 --> 02:13:30,800
'There is still time,' he exclaimed.

1873
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:31,800
'Think!

1874
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:33,139
You may regret it later.'

1875
02:13:33,139 --> 02:13:34,139
'Never!'

1876
02:13:34,139 --> 02:13:35,139
she cried.

1877
02:13:35,139 --> 02:13:36,139
The clock struck twelve.

1878
02:13:36,139 --> 02:13:37,139
'Midnight!'

1879
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:38,139
she said.

1880
02:13:38,139 --> 02:13:39,300
'Tomorrow is already here!

1881
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:44,790
We have just one more day to wait!'

1882
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:48,580
He rose to go.

1883
02:13:48,580 --> 02:13:50,919
'You've got the passports?'

1884
02:13:50,919 --> 02:13:51,929
'Yes.'

1885
02:13:51,929 --> 02:13:54,439
'You haven't forgotten anything?'

1886
02:13:54,439 --> 02:13:55,530
'No.'

1887
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:57,709
'You're sure?'

1888
02:13:57,709 --> 02:13:59,889
'Quite sure.'

1889
02:13:59,889 --> 02:14:03,860
'You'll be waiting for me at the Hotel de
Provence, won't you?

1890
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:04,860
At twelve o'clock?'

1891
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:05,989
He nodded.

1892
02:14:05,989 --> 02:14:12,309
'Tomorrow, then!' said Emma, and she watched
him go.

1893
02:14:12,309 --> 02:14:17,389
He did not look back.

1894
02:14:17,389 --> 02:14:22,060
After a few minutes Rodolphe stopped, and
when he saw her white figure disappear into

1895
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:27,519
the shadows his heart began to beat so wildly
that he had to lean against a tree to keep

1896
02:14:27,519 --> 02:14:29,139
himself from falling.

1897
02:14:29,139 --> 02:14:33,340
'What a fool I am!

1898
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:38,780
But, never mind, she was a fine little woman!'

1899
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:44,090
And as he said it, Emma's beauty, the thought
of all the times they had had together, came

1900
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:46,320
back into his mind.

1901
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:52,460
For a moment tears came to his eyes, but then
he felt a wave of anger against her.

1902
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:58,749
'After all,' he cried, 'I couldn't just go
and bury myself alive like that - and have

1903
02:14:58,749 --> 02:15:00,989
to look after the child too!

1904
02:15:00,989 --> 02:15:03,570
And think of the worry, the expense!

1905
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:10,070
Ah, no, it would have been too silly!'

1906
02:15:10,070 --> 02:15:12,380
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Goodbye

1907
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:19,809
The letter Rodolphe wrote that evening ended
with the words:

1908
02:15:19,809 --> 02:15:23,499
... I shall be far away when you read these
sad lines.

1909
02:15:23,499 --> 02:15:28,940
I have made up my mind to go at once, so that
I cannot see you again!

1910
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:34,820
I shall come back, no doubt, and perhaps one
day we shall talk together of the time when

1911
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:37,889
we were lovers.

1912
02:15:37,889 --> 02:15:40,650
Your Friend.

1913
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:46,960
As she read these words the next morning,
Emma's first thought was to kill herself.

1914
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:52,030
Life no longer had meaning; how could she
eat another meal, sit in the same room as

1915
02:15:52,030 --> 02:15:53,469
her husband?

1916
02:15:53,469 --> 02:15:54,469
Rodolphe!

1917
02:15:54,469 --> 02:15:56,489
How could she live without him?

1918
02:15:56,489 --> 02:16:01,960
The room started to spin around her, nothing
was still, she could not see, and everything

1919
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:02,960
went black.

1920
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:09,050
Then Charles was shouting for help, Berthe
was screaming, and Felicite, the maid, with

1921
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:13,090
shaking hands, was loosening her mistress's
clothing.

1922
02:16:13,090 --> 02:16:17,469
Emma herself lay stretched out on the floor,
shaking from head to foot.

1923
02:16:17,469 --> 02:16:18,469
'Speak!

1924
02:16:18,469 --> 02:16:19,469
speak!'

1925
02:16:19,469 --> 02:16:20,860
Charles kept on saying.

1926
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:21,860
'Emma!

1927
02:16:21,860 --> 02:16:24,590
It's me, your own Charles, who loves you.

1928
02:16:24,590 --> 02:16:25,590
Don't you know me?

1929
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:26,590
Here!

1930
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:27,820
Here's your little one.

1931
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:29,730
Kiss her, Emma!'

1932
02:16:29,730 --> 02:16:33,740
The child stretched out her arms to her mother,
to put them round her neck.

1933
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:37,960
But Emma turned away her head and cried, 'No,
no...

1934
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,769
No one!'

1935
02:16:39,769 --> 02:16:41,219
She fainted away again.

1936
02:16:41,219 --> 02:16:43,679
They carried her up to bed.

1937
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:48,939
She lay there, her mouth open, her eyes shut,
her hands open, quite still.

1938
02:16:48,939 --> 02:16:53,370
The tears ran from her eyes on to the pillow.

1939
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:58,559
For forty-three days Charles never left Emma's
side.

1940
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:01,380
His patients had to take care of themselves.

1941
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:05,840
He called in Monsieur Canivet, in consultation.

1942
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:12,630
He sent to Rouen for Dr Lariviere, his old
master; he was desperate.

1943
02:17:12,630 --> 02:17:16,090
What scared him most was Emma's depressed
condition.

1944
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:21,479
She did not speak, took no notice of anything,
and did not even seem to suffer - as if her

1945
02:17:21,479 --> 02:17:27,899
soul and body were both resting after the
shock through which they had passed.

1946
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:33,159
About halfway through October she was able
to sit up in bed, supported by pillows.

1947
02:17:33,159 --> 02:17:38,750
Charles cried when he saw her eating her first
piece of bread and jam.

1948
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:44,150
She began to recover her strength and got
up for an hour or two in the afternoons, and

1949
02:17:44,150 --> 02:17:49,420
one day, when she was feeling much better,
he persuaded her to walk a little in the garden,

1950
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:50,840
leaning on his arm.

1951
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:58,609
So they went, arm in arm, to the bottom of
the garden and its low wall.

1952
02:17:58,609 --> 02:18:05,809
Slowly she looked up and, shading her eyes
with her hand, she looked away, far, far away,

1953
02:18:05,809 --> 02:18:08,189
into the distance.

1954
02:18:08,189 --> 02:18:14,910
But there was nothing on the skyline except
the smoke of burning grass on the hills.

1955
02:18:14,910 --> 02:18:19,690
She turned back to look into the garden, and
remembered Rodolphe, remembered their nights

1956
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:26,330
of love in this place, and fell back into
Charles's arms, seeing nothing.

1957
02:18:26,330 --> 02:18:32,010
That night she was as ill as before, though
this time her condition was more complicated.

1958
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:34,429
First it was her heart that troubled her.

1959
02:18:34,429 --> 02:18:36,389
Then her chest, or her head.

1960
02:18:36,389 --> 02:18:42,050
Then she had attacks of vomiting, which Charles
thought might be the early signs of cancer.

1961
02:18:42,050 --> 02:18:46,899
And on top of all this trouble, the poor man
was worried about money.

1962
02:18:46,899 --> 02:18:51,529
First, he did not know how he was going to
pay Monsieur Homais for all the medicines

1963
02:18:51,529 --> 02:18:53,279
he had had from him.

1964
02:18:53,279 --> 02:18:54,969
And the bills kept pouring in.

1965
02:18:54,969 --> 02:18:59,679
Monsieur Lheureux, the draper, was especially
difficult.

1966
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:05,309
In fact, when Emma's illness was at its worst,
Lheureux, taking advantage of the situation,

1967
02:19:05,309 --> 02:19:11,769
had rushed over with the coat, the travelling
bag, two travelling boxes instead of one,

1968
02:19:11,769 --> 02:19:14,170
and other unordered items as well!

1969
02:19:14,170 --> 02:19:19,029
Charles, of course, said he had no use for
them, but it was no good; the goods had been

1970
02:19:19,029 --> 02:19:23,109
ordered, and the draper was not going to take
them back.

1971
02:19:23,109 --> 02:19:29,370
In the end, Bovary found himself signing a
document promising to pay in six months - and

1972
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:32,229
then borrowing another thousand francs!

1973
02:19:32,229 --> 02:19:37,529
So Charles's problems worsened, while Lheureux
was delighted to have both husband and wife

1974
02:19:37,529 --> 02:19:38,529
in his debt.

1975
02:19:38,529 --> 02:19:42,229
He saw it as a good investment.

1976
02:19:42,229 --> 02:19:47,439
Charles often wondered how he was going to
pay all this money back next year.

1977
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:53,350
He thought and thought; maybe he should ask
his father for help, or sell something.

1978
02:19:53,350 --> 02:20:00,390
But his father would not listen, and he - well,
he had nothing to sell.

1979
02:20:00,390 --> 02:20:04,790
And then the whole situation began to look
so black that he hurriedly pushed it out of

1980
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:05,859
his mind.

1981
02:20:05,859 --> 02:20:11,399
The winter was a hard one, and Emma took longer
to recover this time.

1982
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:16,550
When the weather was fine, they pushed her
chair up to the window, so that she could

1983
02:20:16,550 --> 02:20:19,069
look out on the square.

1984
02:20:19,069 --> 02:20:23,859
She had now taken a violent dislike to the
garden, and the curtains on that side were

1985
02:20:23,859 --> 02:20:25,449
always closed.

1986
02:20:25,449 --> 02:20:31,060
Now she passed her time reading religious
texts which the priest brought for her, and

1987
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:34,540
Rodolphe was pushed back into a hidden place
in her heart.

1988
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:40,250
And although her recovery continued, she was
so much changed that she even enjoyed the

1989
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:42,820
company of the respectable married women of
Yonville.

1990
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:50,439
When the spring came, she had the whole garden
torn up from end to end.

1991
02:20:50,439 --> 02:20:55,640
Her old energy had begun to return as her
health improved, and although Monsieur Bournisien,

1992
02:20:55,640 --> 02:21:01,370
the priest, still continued to visit her every
day, she went to church less often.

1993
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:06,641
She began to enjoy time spent out of doors,
looking over the new garden, even sitting

1994
02:21:06,641 --> 02:21:11,109
outside with Charles and Monsieur Homais in
the warmer evenings.

1995
02:21:11,109 --> 02:21:15,500
It was on one of these evenings, as Monsieur
Homais talked about the pleasures one could

1996
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:20,880
gain from literature and music, that the idea
of going to see Lucia di Lammermoor at the

1997
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:23,460
theatre in Rouen was raised.

1998
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:29,800
Emma was against the idea at first, but Charles
felt that the change would do her good, and

1999
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:35,300
he wanted to give her a little pleasure, despite
his debts and their other worries.

2000
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:40,870
So Monsieur and Madame Bovary drove in to
Rouen on the Friday coach and got down at

2001
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:45,449
the Hotel de la Croix Rouge, in the place
Beauvoisine.

2002
02:21:45,449 --> 02:21:52,430
Leaving Emma at the hotel, Charles at once
went out to buy tickets for the theatre.

2003
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:59,790
CHAPTER TWELVE
A Visit to the Theatre

2004
02:21:59,790 --> 02:22:04,060
Emma was pleased that her husband had bought
good seats, and when she sat down she could

2005
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:10,360
not resist a little smile of pride as she
looked at the ordinary people down below.

2006
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:15,560
Soon the candles were being lit, the musicians
were taking their places and the opera was

2007
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:17,649
starting.

2008
02:22:17,649 --> 02:22:22,810
When they began to play, she lost herself
in the music, her eyes almost blinded by the

2009
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:27,090
richness of the colours, the beauty of the
singers.

2010
02:22:27,090 --> 02:22:33,020
And their voices, their beautiful bodies dressed
in the finest clothes you could imagine, their

2011
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:36,680
noble emotions - it was too much!

2012
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:41,390
Poor Charles, however, could understand none
of it.

2013
02:22:41,390 --> 02:22:46,050
'Why is he so unkind to her?' he whispered.

2014
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:50,060
'But he isn't,' she answered.

2015
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:52,359
'He's her lover.'

2016
02:22:52,359 --> 02:22:56,359
Emma tried to explain as well as she could,
but he confessed that he could not follow

2017
02:22:56,359 --> 02:23:00,489
the story because all this music stopped him
from hearing the words.

2018
02:23:00,489 --> 02:23:03,880
'What does it matter?' said Emma.

2019
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:05,729
'Be quiet!'

2020
02:23:05,729 --> 02:23:12,279
'Well, you see,' he answered, leaning over
on her shoulder, 'I like to understand things;

2021
02:23:12,279 --> 02:23:14,250
you know I always do.'

2022
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,489
'Oh, please be quiet!'

2023
02:23:16,489 --> 02:23:18,590
she cried impatiently.

2024
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:24,540
So Charles sat in silence while Emma became
more and more involved in the story of the

2025
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:29,370
tragic heroine, a story which made her think
about her own life.

2026
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:35,300
As the singer came to the front of the stage,
supported by her women, white flowers in her

2027
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:40,900
hair, and as pale as death, Emma began dreaming
of her own marriage.

2028
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:45,670
She saw herself back again on the little footpath,
when she and her father were making their

2029
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:46,989
way to the church.

2030
02:23:46,989 --> 02:23:52,370
Why had she not fought against her father,
as Lucia had done?

2031
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:58,270
Instead, she had been happy and light-hearted,
never realizing how she was throwing herself

2032
02:23:58,270 --> 02:23:59,270
away!

2033
02:23:59,270 --> 02:24:03,920
The curtain fell at the end of the first act.

2034
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:08,630
Emma wanted to go out; the corridors were
crowded with people, and she sank back in

2035
02:24:08,630 --> 02:24:13,020
her seat feeling as if she could not breathe.

2036
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:16,280
Charles thought she was going to faint, and
rushed off to the bar to get her a glass of

2037
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:18,050
water.

2038
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:23,479
When he returned with the water, he also brought
the news that he had seen Monsieur Leon.

2039
02:24:23,479 --> 02:24:24,800
'Leon?'

2040
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:26,740
'The man himself!

2041
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:29,449
He's coming round in a minute to see you!'

2042
02:24:29,449 --> 02:24:35,439
And before these words were out of his mouth,
the ex-clerk from Yonville came and sat beside

2043
02:24:35,439 --> 02:24:36,439
her.

2044
02:24:36,439 --> 02:24:42,090
He put out his hand, and Madame Bovary gave
him hers, mechanically, as if obeying some

2045
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:45,710
force of attraction she could not resist.

2046
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:50,569
She had not felt this hand since that spring
evening when the rain was falling on the green

2047
02:24:50,569 --> 02:24:55,070
leaves and they said goodbye standing beside
the window.

2048
02:24:55,070 --> 02:24:57,740
'Oh, how do you do?

2049
02:24:57,740 --> 02:24:59,729
Imagine it!

2050
02:24:59,729 --> 02:25:01,260
You here?'

2051
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:06,840
They could not talk now, as the opera had
begun again, but from that moment she stopped

2052
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:07,840
listening.

2053
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:14,870
Everything seemed to be taking place far away,
like the sound of music from a distant room.

2054
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:21,489
As soon as the opera had finished, all three
of them went and sat in the open air, outside

2055
02:25:21,489 --> 02:25:22,489
a cafe.

2056
02:25:22,489 --> 02:25:27,930
They began by talking about her illness, Emma
interrupting Charles every now and then for

2057
02:25:27,930 --> 02:25:29,920
fear, she said, of boring Monsieur Leon.

2058
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:37,300
Then Leon told them how he was going to spend
two years in a lawyer's office here in Rouen.

2059
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:42,460
He said that he needed the experience as the
work in Normandy was very different from the

2060
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:46,620
kind of thing he had been doing in Paris.

2061
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:51,060
People coming away from the theatre passed
along in front of them on the pavement, some

2062
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:53,399
still singing the tunes from the opera.

2063
02:25:53,399 --> 02:25:59,080
Although Leon had not been impressed by the
leading male singer, Charles (who had begun

2064
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:04,300
to understand things better towards the end
of the show) had appreciated his voice and

2065
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:06,830
said he would love to hear him again.

2066
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:11,470
'Oh, well,' said Leon, 'he'll be giving another
performance soon.'

2067
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:15,810
But Charles replied that they were going home
in the morning.

2068
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:23,029
'Unless you'd like to stay a little longer
by yourself,' he added, turning to his wife.

2069
02:26:23,029 --> 02:26:27,710
When Leon saw that there was a chance Emma
might be able to stay, he began to praise

2070
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:34,000
the singer, and Charles became even more certain
that she must stay in Rouen for an extra night.

2071
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,910
'You can come back on Sunday.

2072
02:26:35,910 --> 02:26:41,800
It's silly of you not to stay, if you feel
it's doing you even the slightest bit of good.'

2073
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:46,439
And so it was arranged that Charles would
return to Yonville in the morning, and Leon

2074
02:26:46,439 --> 02:26:54,290
would go to the opera with Madame Bovary on
the following evening.

2075
02:26:54,290 --> 02:26:57,910
Since leaving Yonville, Leon had not forgotten
Emma.

2076
02:26:57,910 --> 02:27:03,720
In Paris, he had worked at his studies and
had not had the wild time he had imagined.

2077
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:09,770
It had been a happy but unexciting period,
and he had sometimes dreamed of the love that

2078
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:12,700
might have been between them.

2079
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:17,840
Seeing her again, after three long years,
all his hopes returned.

2080
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:22,310
This time he thought he really would have
to bring things to a conclusion.

2081
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:28,630
He was less shy now, more sure of himself,
and after his time in Paris he felt quite

2082
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:33,160
confident that he could have his way with
this country doctor's wife.

2083
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:38,640
He would not have been brave enough to make
the attempt in Paris, but away from the capital

2084
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:40,340
he had the courage.

2085
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:46,140
When they met the following afternoon, he
did his best to make himself interesting to

2086
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:47,140
her.

2087
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:52,170
He talked, therefore, about how unhappy he
had been since he left Yonville, and how his

2088
02:27:52,170 --> 02:27:54,140
dreams had been disappointed.

2089
02:27:54,140 --> 02:28:00,470
'If you only knew,' she said, 'the dreams
that I have dreamed.'

2090
02:28:00,470 --> 02:28:05,270
And tears shone in her beautiful eyes as she
raised them to the ceiling.

2091
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:07,740
'And I, too!'

2092
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:09,390
cried Leon.

2093
02:28:09,390 --> 02:28:14,760
'I often went out, trying to lose myself in
the noise of the crowd, but I was never able

2094
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:18,279
to get you out of my thoughts.'

2095
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:23,029
Madame Bovary turned away her head so that
he should not see the smile she felt on her

2096
02:28:23,029 --> 02:28:24,569
lips.

2097
02:28:24,569 --> 02:28:30,859
She let him speak, saying nothing, waiting
for him to say what she wanted to hear.

2098
02:28:30,859 --> 02:28:33,110
She did not have to wait long.

2099
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:38,050
'And,' he went on, 'I wrote you so many letters
that I never sent.'

2100
02:28:38,050 --> 02:28:40,460
'But why?'

2101
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:42,870
she asked.

2102
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:44,080
'Why?'

2103
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:46,270
And he hesitated a moment.

2104
02:28:46,270 --> 02:28:50,470
'Because I loved you!'

2105
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:55,121
Congratulating himself for having said the
words, Leon watched her out of the corner

2106
02:28:55,121 --> 02:28:56,699
of his eye.

2107
02:28:56,699 --> 02:29:02,010
It was like looking at the sky after the sun
has chased away the clouds.

2108
02:29:02,010 --> 02:29:06,021
Her whole face was lit up with joy.

2109
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:13,350
He waited, and at last she said, 'I always
thought you did.'

2110
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:17,859
Then they talked about all the things that
had happened when he lived in Yonville.

2111
02:29:17,859 --> 02:29:22,689
They spoke of the flowers in her garden, the
dresses she used to wear, the furniture in

2112
02:29:22,689 --> 02:29:26,931
her bedroom, and of all the things in and
around the house.

2113
02:29:26,931 --> 02:29:32,850
They talked and talked, and before they realized
how time had passed, it was eight o'clock.

2114
02:29:32,850 --> 02:29:36,689
She rose to light the candles; then she came
and sat down again.

2115
02:29:36,689 --> 02:29:42,750
'Well?' said Leon, and he reached out and
touched her hand.

2116
02:29:42,750 --> 02:29:46,390
'What could stop us from beginning all over
again now?'

2117
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:49,170
'No, my friend,' she replied.

2118
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:52,960
'I am too old... you are too young...

2119
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:55,180
Forget all about me.

2120
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:59,550
Others will love you... and you will love
them.'

2121
02:29:59,550 --> 02:30:02,529
'Not as I love you,' he cried.

2122
02:30:02,529 --> 02:30:05,300
'What a child you are!

2123
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:06,930
We have to be sensible!

2124
02:30:06,930 --> 02:30:09,010
I mean it!'

2125
02:30:09,010 --> 02:30:13,850
And she did mean it - she intended to keep
her distance, to be responsible.

2126
02:30:13,850 --> 02:30:17,819
She had suffered too much to want to open
those wounds again.

2127
02:30:17,819 --> 02:30:22,040
However, she was not prepared for Leon's shyness.

2128
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:26,399
If he had been another Rodolphe, it would
have been easy; she could have pushed him

2129
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:27,930
away without an effort.

2130
02:30:27,930 --> 02:30:35,939
But Leon was so beautiful, so full of desire
for her - she could see it in his eyes - but

2131
02:30:35,939 --> 02:30:39,390
so gentle, she did not know what to do.

2132
02:30:39,390 --> 02:30:45,610
When he took her face in his hands and kissed
her, she could not resist, because he did

2133
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:48,990
it without force, with such care.

2134
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:52,689
But still, she could not let this happen!

2135
02:30:52,689 --> 02:30:57,460
So she looked at the clock above the fireplace
and said, 'Heavens, look at the time!

2136
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:59,260
We have forgotten all about the theatre!

2137
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:04,810
And I must go back to my poor husband tomorrow,
so there is my last chance gone!'

2138
02:31:04,810 --> 02:31:08,080
'Are you really going back?' said Leon.

2139
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:09,130
'I am.'

2140
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:12,870
'But I must see you again,' he said.

2141
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:15,399
'I had something I wanted to tell you...'

2142
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:18,250
'What is it?'

2143
02:31:18,250 --> 02:31:19,250
'Something...

2144
02:31:19,250 --> 02:31:22,680
Oh, something very serious, very important!

2145
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:24,340
Ah, but no!

2146
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:25,340
You won't go back.

2147
02:31:25,340 --> 02:31:26,340
You can't.

2148
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:27,340
If you only knew...

2149
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:29,110
Listen, you mustn't go like this!

2150
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:31,250
Let me see you again, I beg you.

2151
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:33,979
Once, just once!'

2152
02:31:33,979 --> 02:31:35,979
'Well...'

2153
02:31:35,979 --> 02:31:36,979
And she stopped.

2154
02:31:36,979 --> 02:31:43,120
And then, as if on second thoughts, she said,
'Oh, no.

2155
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:44,570
Not here!'

2156
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:47,199
'Wherever you like.'

2157
02:31:47,199 --> 02:31:49,750
'Will you...?'

2158
02:31:49,750 --> 02:31:51,760
She seemed to be thinking.

2159
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:56,130
Then suddenly she said, 'Tomorrow, at eleven,
in the cathedral.'

2160
02:31:56,130 --> 02:32:01,390
'I shall be there,' he cried, taking both
her hands.

2161
02:32:01,390 --> 02:32:09,330
But that night Emma wrote a long, long letter,
excusing herself from meeting him.

2162
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:14,080
It was all over now, and, for their own sakes,
it would be better for them not to meet.

2163
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:19,239
But when the letter was sealed up, she realized
she did not know Leon's address.

2164
02:32:19,239 --> 02:32:22,811
'I will give it to him myself,' she said.

2165
02:32:22,811 --> 02:32:25,610
'He is sure to come.'

2166
02:32:25,610 --> 02:32:31,370
Leon arrived early at the cathedral, and had
to wait in the cool shadows for what seemed

2167
02:32:31,370 --> 02:32:32,830
like hours.

2168
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:38,189
Suddenly, at around eleven o'clock, there
was the sound of silk upon the stones, the

2169
02:32:38,189 --> 02:32:39,720
shadow of a hat on the wall...

2170
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,380
It was Emma!

2171
02:32:41,380 --> 02:32:46,270
Leon rose and went to meet her.

2172
02:32:46,270 --> 02:32:49,250
Emma was pale, and she was walking quickly.

2173
02:32:49,250 --> 02:32:51,390
'Read this!'

2174
02:32:51,390 --> 02:32:53,240
she said, holding out a paper.

2175
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:58,489
But then, seeming to change her mind, she
cried out, 'Oh no!

2176
02:32:58,489 --> 02:33:00,399
Never mind!'

2177
02:33:00,399 --> 02:33:04,970
And she quickly tore away her hand, and went
out into the sunshine again.

2178
02:33:04,970 --> 02:33:08,029
She did not know what to do, how to go on.

2179
02:33:08,029 --> 02:33:13,180
She wanted to be here, to be with him, and
at the same time to fly, fly away.

2180
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:19,939
Leon followed, feeling that his love was in
danger of disappearing like smoke.

2181
02:33:19,939 --> 02:33:24,850
Wanting to take back control of the situation
(which he felt was slipping through his fingers),

2182
02:33:24,850 --> 02:33:28,590
he decided to hire one of the carriages which
were waiting.

2183
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:32,970
They could drive away, be together in this
private, dark space.

2184
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:39,060
They could not go to his room, nor to hers,
so a carriage, hired for the day, would be

2185
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:41,479
their shelter.

2186
02:33:41,479 --> 02:33:43,920
'Leon, really...

2187
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,160
I don't know whether I ought.

2188
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:47,580
It's not the proper thing to do.

2189
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:49,010
You know it isn't!'

2190
02:33:49,010 --> 02:33:52,409
'Why not?' answered the clerk.

2191
02:33:52,409 --> 02:33:54,930
'It's done in Paris.'

2192
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:57,229
Emma had no reply to this.

2193
02:33:57,229 --> 02:34:00,530
'Where to, sir?' said the driver.

2194
02:34:00,530 --> 02:34:08,189
'Wherever you like,' said Leon, pushing Emma
inside; and so they set off, first going down

2195
02:34:08,189 --> 02:34:13,160
to the bridge over the river, then across
the main square, past the town hall and stopping

2196
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:14,279
beside a statue.

2197
02:34:14,279 --> 02:34:18,140
'Keep going,' said a voice from inside.

2198
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:23,310
The carriage started again and, following
the downhill road after leaving the centre

2199
02:34:23,310 --> 02:34:28,770
of town, it drove at full speed into the square
in front of the railway station.

2200
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:30,729
'No, no, straight on!'

2201
02:34:30,729 --> 02:34:34,290
shouted the voice again.

2202
02:34:34,290 --> 02:34:38,160
The driver took them out of town through the
big gates, down to the waterside.

2203
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:43,170
Along by the river the vehicle went, towards
the little town of Oyssel.

2204
02:34:43,170 --> 02:34:48,460
And on and on went the carriage, with its
sweating driver and tired horse.

2205
02:34:48,460 --> 02:34:54,170
Each time they stopped, the man's voice cried
out, 'Drive on, drive on!' until, at about

2206
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:59,979
six in the evening, the carriage stopped in
a side street and a woman got out.

2207
02:34:59,979 --> 02:35:08,830
She walked away with her face hidden, looking
neither to the right nor to the left.

2208
02:35:08,830 --> 02:35:13,590
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Love Once More

2209
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:21,189
When she got back to her hotel, Emma was shocked
not to find the Yonville coach.

2210
02:35:21,189 --> 02:35:27,300
The driver had waited fifty-three minutes,
and had at last set off without her.

2211
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:31,319
Although there was no strong reason why she
should go home, she had promised that she

2212
02:35:31,319 --> 02:35:35,850
would be back that evening, and she knew Charles
would be expecting her.

2213
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:42,310
In her heart she was also feeling guilty for
her afternoon of love with Leon.

2214
02:35:42,310 --> 02:35:46,140
Going home this evening was an easy way of
making herself feel better about what she

2215
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:47,850
had just done.

2216
02:35:47,850 --> 02:35:52,590
So she threw her things into her bag, paid
her bill, hired a small carriage from the

2217
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:58,420
hotel and, telling the driver to drive like
the wind, managed to catch up with the coach

2218
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:02,130
just as it was driving into Quincampoix.

2219
02:36:02,130 --> 02:36:06,760
She had hardly sunk into her corner when she
closed her eyes, and did not open them again

2220
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:08,750
till they were at the bottom of the hill.

2221
02:36:08,750 --> 02:36:14,649
Some way off, she recognized her maid, Felicite,
who was waiting for her at the entrance to

2222
02:36:14,649 --> 02:36:16,210
the village.

2223
02:36:16,210 --> 02:36:22,520
The driver pulled in to the side, and the
maid called up to her mistress, 'Madame, you

2224
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:24,330
must go at once to Monsieur Homais.

2225
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:25,609
Something very urgent!'

2226
02:36:25,609 --> 02:36:31,670
The village was as quiet as usual, but when
she went into Monsieur Homais' house she found

2227
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:36,050
the pharmacist waiting for her with a serious
expression on his face.

2228
02:36:36,050 --> 02:36:39,880
'Madame, I fear I have bad news for you.

2229
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:43,310
Your father-in-law is dead!'

2230
02:36:43,310 --> 02:36:48,300
In fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had died the
previous evening quite suddenly just after

2231
02:36:48,300 --> 02:36:50,550
getting up from dinner.

2232
02:36:50,550 --> 02:36:54,670
As Charles was anxious that Emma should not
be upset, he had asked Monsieur Homais to

2233
02:36:54,670 --> 02:36:56,580
break the news to her.

2234
02:36:56,580 --> 02:37:02,180
He had thought it might be less of a shock
if it came from someone outside the family.

2235
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:07,290
Although Charles's thought was kind, Emma
was not, in fact, greatly upset, and went

2236
02:37:07,290 --> 02:37:10,050
immediately to her house.

2237
02:37:10,050 --> 02:37:15,060
When he heard Emma knock, Charles came forward
to greet her with open arms and said, with

2238
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:18,189
tears in his voice, 'Ah!

2239
02:37:18,189 --> 02:37:20,370
My dear...'

2240
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:24,930
He bent down to kiss her, but at the touch
of his lips, the memory of her lover took

2241
02:37:24,930 --> 02:37:30,729
hold of her and she passed her hand over her
face to hide her look of disgust.

2242
02:37:30,729 --> 02:37:39,270
Nevertheless, she managed to say, 'Yes, I
know... I know...'

2243
02:37:39,270 --> 02:37:42,900
He showed her the letter in which his mother
told him the news.

2244
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:49,210
Emma gave the letter back, and at dinner,
out of politeness, pretended to have no appetite.

2245
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:55,310
But as he encouraged her, she forced herself
to eat, while Charles sat facing her in motionless

2246
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:56,970
sorrow.

2247
02:37:56,970 --> 02:38:01,060
Every now and then he would raise his head
and look at her sadly.

2248
02:38:01,060 --> 02:38:06,060
Once he said, 'I wish I could have seen him
one more time!'

2249
02:38:06,060 --> 02:38:07,590
She made no answer.

2250
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:13,040
Then, realizing that some sort of comment
was required of her, she asked, 'How old was

2251
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:14,899
your father?'

2252
02:38:14,899 --> 02:38:15,899
'Fifty-eight.'

2253
02:38:15,899 --> 02:38:16,899
'Oh!'

2254
02:38:16,899 --> 02:38:20,020
And that was all.

2255
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:24,830
A quarter of an hour afterwards he added,
'Poor mother!

2256
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:28,630
What will happen to her now?'

2257
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:32,670
Emma had no idea, and made a silent gesture.

2258
02:38:32,670 --> 02:38:38,350
Feeling that her silence was the result of
sorrow at the news, Charles made an effort

2259
02:38:38,350 --> 02:38:39,859
to be more cheerful.

2260
02:38:39,859 --> 02:38:43,090
'Did you have a good time yesterday?'

2261
02:38:43,090 --> 02:38:47,140
'Yes,' she replied.

2262
02:38:47,140 --> 02:38:50,609
When the table was cleared, neither Bovary
nor Emma moved.

2263
02:38:50,609 --> 02:38:56,699
As she continued to look at him, she found
that she could not pity him.

2264
02:38:56,699 --> 02:39:00,939
He seemed a weak thing, a poor man in every
way.

2265
02:39:00,939 --> 02:39:03,450
How could she get rid of him?

2266
02:39:03,450 --> 02:39:08,970
The evening would be endless!

2267
02:39:08,970 --> 02:39:13,380
Next day Charles's mother arrived, and the
weeping started again.

2268
02:39:13,380 --> 02:39:17,859
Emma said she had a lot of things to organize
and went out.

2269
02:39:17,859 --> 02:39:23,120
Charles thought of his father, and he was
surprised at feeling so affectionate towards

2270
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,120
him.

2271
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:26,689
He had never thought he loved his father.

2272
02:39:26,689 --> 02:39:29,920
Madame Bovary senior also thought of her husband.

2273
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:35,729
It was all over now, and even the worst of
her days with him were pleasant memories.

2274
02:39:35,729 --> 02:39:42,470
While the son thought about his lost father,
Emma thought that only forty-eight hours earlier

2275
02:39:42,470 --> 02:39:48,500
she and Leon were together, with the world
shut out, drowning in love, amazed by each

2276
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:50,170
other's beauty.

2277
02:39:50,170 --> 02:39:54,859
She tried to recover the details of that lost
day of happiness and pleasure.

2278
02:39:54,859 --> 02:39:59,659
She would have liked to hear and see nothing
new in order not to lose a moment of remembered

2279
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:05,930
delight, but she found that her husbands noisy
sorrow was driving it all from her memory.

2280
02:40:05,930 --> 02:40:12,050
The next afternoon, when all three of them
were sitting in the garden, they saw Monsieur

2281
02:40:12,050 --> 02:40:13,819
Lheureux coming through the gate.

2282
02:40:13,819 --> 02:40:18,390
He had heard of the sad event, and had come
to visit them.

2283
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:23,641
After he had expressed his sorrow at their
loss, he said to Charles, 'Could I have a

2284
02:40:23,641 --> 02:40:25,990
word in private with your wife?

2285
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:31,770
It's about that matter, er... you know!'

2286
02:40:31,770 --> 02:40:37,689
Charles blushed to the roots of his hair as
he answered, 'Ah, yes... of course.

2287
02:40:37,689 --> 02:40:40,800
Darling, do you think...?'

2288
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:44,080
She seemed to understand, and got up.

2289
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:47,069
'It's nothing!' said Charles to his mother.

2290
02:40:47,069 --> 02:40:51,479
'Only a little household matter.'

2291
02:40:51,479 --> 02:40:56,199
As soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux
began to congratulate Emma on the money she

2292
02:40:56,199 --> 02:41:00,380
and her husband would have now that Monsieur
Bovary's father had died.

2293
02:41:00,380 --> 02:41:06,520
'And as you are well again,' he continued,
'I was coming to make proposals for another

2294
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:07,540
arrangement.'

2295
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:14,290
What he in fact proposed was that Emma should
take over the responsibility for all the debts

2296
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:17,410
'to stop her husband worrying'.

2297
02:41:17,410 --> 02:41:23,510
Then she and Monsieur Lheureux would be able
to settle all the details.

2298
02:41:23,510 --> 02:41:26,850
She did not understand, so she said nothing.

2299
02:41:26,850 --> 02:41:31,700
Lheureux quickly added that there were some
things that Madame could not possibly do without.

2300
02:41:31,700 --> 02:41:37,739
For example, he would send her across a dozen
metres of beautiful black silk for a dress.

2301
02:41:37,739 --> 02:41:42,930
'The one you have on is good enough for the
house, but you need another one for visiting.

2302
02:41:42,930 --> 02:41:46,689
I saw that straight away, when I came in.'

2303
02:41:46,689 --> 02:41:50,810
He did not send the fabric; he brought it.

2304
02:41:50,810 --> 02:41:52,960
Then he came back for the measurements.

2305
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:59,410
He kept coming back, doing everything he could
to be of use, to make himself liked.

2306
02:41:59,410 --> 02:42:04,489
And every time he came, he reminded her that
she should be the one who managed the couple's

2307
02:42:04,489 --> 02:42:08,160
legal and financial affairs.

2308
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:13,159
He never mentioned the old bills, and she
never let them enter her head.

2309
02:42:13,159 --> 02:42:16,550
Charles certainly had said something about
them when she was beginning to get better,

2310
02:42:16,550 --> 02:42:22,390
but she had so many things to worry her at
the time that she thought no more about them.

2311
02:42:22,390 --> 02:42:28,590
Moreover, she avoided starting any discussion
about money while her mother-in-law was there.

2312
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:34,510
But, as soon as she had left, Emma began to
amaze her husband with her practical good

2313
02:42:34,510 --> 02:42:35,640
sense.

2314
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:38,420
They really did have to manage things better.

2315
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:43,500
She used a number of technical terms, spoke
impressively about planning for the future,

2316
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:49,100
and never missed a chance of exaggerating
how complicated it would be to make the right

2317
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:50,260
arrangements.

2318
02:42:50,260 --> 02:42:56,180
Finally, she put in front of him one day a
form which gave her the power to manage all

2319
02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:59,060
his financial affairs.

2320
02:42:59,060 --> 02:43:02,800
She had profited well from Lheureux's lessons.

2321
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:09,350
Charles - good, simple man - asked her where
the form came from.

2322
02:43:09,350 --> 02:43:14,180
She told him it had been written by Monsieur
Guillaumin, the Yonville lawyer, and then

2323
02:43:14,180 --> 02:43:18,040
added, 'But I wouldn't trust him further than
I could see him.

2324
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:21,010
These lawyers are nearly as bad as the criminals
they work with.

2325
02:43:21,010 --> 02:43:23,340
Perhaps we ought to consult...

2326
02:43:23,340 --> 02:43:25,270
No, there's no one!'

2327
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:31,489
'What about Leon?' said Charles, thinking
hard.

2328
02:43:31,489 --> 02:43:35,859
He had said exactly the name Emma wanted him
to say.

2329
02:43:35,859 --> 02:43:40,290
Now she could suggest that it was difficult
to explain matters by letter, and she offered

2330
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:43,250
to go over to Rouen and speak to him directly.

2331
02:43:43,250 --> 02:43:46,189
Charles would not hear of troubling her.

2332
02:43:46,189 --> 02:43:47,790
She insisted.

2333
02:43:47,790 --> 02:43:49,840
It was a battle of kindness.

2334
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:53,930
Finally, she cried, 'Now, not another word,
please!

2335
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:55,500
I am going!'

2336
02:43:55,500 --> 02:44:00,340
'How kind you are!' he said, kissing her on
the forehead.

2337
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:07,290
The next morning she was off to Rouen in the
coach, to consult Monsieur Leon.

2338
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:13,470
She stayed for three days.

2339
02:44:13,470 --> 02:44:16,270
They were three wonderful days.

2340
02:44:16,270 --> 02:44:22,149
They stayed down near the harbour at the Hotel
de Boulogne, and there they lived, with the

2341
02:44:22,149 --> 02:44:27,800
curtains closed, the doors locked, the floor
covered with flowers, and iced drinks brought

2342
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:30,670
up every morning.

2343
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:34,659
Towards evening they would take a boat and
go and have dinner on one of the islands.

2344
02:44:34,659 --> 02:44:40,710
As they left the town, smoke rose up among
the trees, and the red sun, reflected on the

2345
02:44:40,710 --> 02:44:46,270
oily water of the harbour, looked like blood
on polished metal.

2346
02:44:46,270 --> 02:44:51,061
They went down between the rows of boats,
and the noises of the town grew fainter and

2347
02:44:51,061 --> 02:44:52,061
fainter.

2348
02:44:52,061 --> 02:44:58,020
When, finally, they arrived at their favourite
restaurant, she untied her hat and they stepped

2349
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:02,189
out of the boat on to their island.

2350
02:45:02,189 --> 02:45:07,270
They went into a small cafe with dark fishing-nets
hung up at the door, and sat themselves down

2351
02:45:07,270 --> 02:45:09,000
in the low-ceilinged room.

2352
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:15,930
They ate small fried fish, followed by cherries
and cream, and then went and sat on the grass.

2353
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:21,260
They kissed and held one another under the
trees, out of view; they would have liked

2354
02:45:21,260 --> 02:45:26,080
to live for ever in that little spot which,
in their present happiness, they thought the

2355
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:28,350
most beautiful place on earth.

2356
02:45:28,350 --> 02:45:33,319
They had both seen trees before, and blue
sky, and grass.

2357
02:45:33,319 --> 02:45:37,300
It was not the first time they had heard the
sound of water and the music of the wind in

2358
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:43,260
the trees, but they had never really admired
these things till now.

2359
02:45:43,260 --> 02:45:48,960
It was as if nature had not really existed
before, or had only begun to show its beauty

2360
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:54,359
after they had satisfied their desires.

2361
02:45:54,359 --> 02:45:57,710
When it was dark, they started for home again.

2362
02:45:57,710 --> 02:46:00,649
The boat kept close to the shores of the little
islands.

2363
02:46:00,649 --> 02:46:07,649
They did not speak, but sat silently in the
back of the boat, listening to the water.

2364
02:46:07,649 --> 02:46:09,800
Emma looked across at Leon.

2365
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:16,200
Her head was raised, her hands were held together,
her eyes raised to the sky.

2366
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:18,029
She was beautiful tonight.

2367
02:46:18,029 --> 02:46:24,250
Then Leon put his hand on a piece of red ribbon
lying in the bottom of the boat.

2368
02:46:24,250 --> 02:46:26,250
The boatman took it and examined it.

2369
02:46:26,250 --> 02:46:34,630
'Ah,' he said at last, 'maybe it belongs to
one of the people I took out a few days ago.

2370
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:40,319
They were having fun I can tell you - ladies
and gentlemen, with cakes, and bottles of

2371
02:46:40,319 --> 02:46:41,319
wine.

2372
02:46:41,319 --> 02:46:42,970
I remember one of them in particular.

2373
02:46:42,970 --> 02:46:46,760
A fine, handsome man he was, with a little
moustache.

2374
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:48,960
Lord, he was funny, though!

2375
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:54,180
They kept on saying, "Come on, tell us another...

2376
02:46:54,180 --> 02:46:55,180
Adolphe...

2377
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:56,180
Rodolphe..."

2378
02:46:56,180 --> 02:46:59,350
Yes, Rodolphe, that was his name.'

2379
02:46:59,350 --> 02:47:01,449
Emma shook from head to foot.

2380
02:47:01,449 --> 02:47:05,569
'What's the matter?' said Leon, moving closer.

2381
02:47:05,569 --> 02:47:08,470
'Oh, it's nothing!

2382
02:47:08,470 --> 02:47:11,350
The night air is a little cool.'

2383
02:47:11,350 --> 02:47:17,939
'The sort of gentleman who has plenty of lady
friends,' added the old boatman.

2384
02:47:17,939 --> 02:47:24,189
The morning after this last dinner on the
island, Emma had to return to Yonville, and

2385
02:47:24,189 --> 02:47:27,270
Leon had to get back to his normal life in
Rouen.

2386
02:47:27,270 --> 02:47:32,689
However, he found this difficult and he started
ignoring his friends and not looking after

2387
02:47:32,689 --> 02:47:34,779
his business.

2388
02:47:34,779 --> 02:47:39,449
Every day he waited for her letters; he read
them again and again, and he wrote back to

2389
02:47:39,449 --> 02:47:44,189
her immediately, remembering every detail
of their time together.

2390
02:47:44,189 --> 02:47:47,510
And unlike most memories, these did not seem
to fade, but grew stronger.

2391
02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:54,590
The need to see her became so great that one
Saturday morning he ran out of his office

2392
02:47:54,590 --> 02:48:01,649
and took the coach to Yonville.

2393
02:48:01,649 --> 02:48:06,170
When he came to the top of the hill above
the village and, looking down over the valley,

2394
02:48:06,170 --> 02:48:11,620
saw the church tower, he felt like a man who
has gone abroad and made his fortune and now

2395
02:48:11,620 --> 02:48:14,550
returns to visit his native village.

2396
02:48:14,550 --> 02:48:19,210
He walked down to her house and saw that there
was a light in the kitchen.

2397
02:48:19,210 --> 02:48:24,180
He watched to see if he could catch sight
of her shadow behind the curtain.

2398
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:27,310
But nothing could be seen.

2399
02:48:27,310 --> 02:48:31,180
Madame Lefrancois met him, and could not believe
her eyes.

2400
02:48:31,180 --> 02:48:36,800
He had dinner in the little dining room, as
in the old days, but alone.

2401
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:39,260
He then went and knocked at the doctor's door.

2402
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:44,439
Madame was upstairs in her bedroom, and did
not come down for a quarter of an hour.

2403
02:48:44,439 --> 02:48:50,590
The doctor appeared delighted to see him and,
to their regret, stayed at home all that day

2404
02:48:50,590 --> 02:48:52,460
and the next.

2405
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:57,319
The only chance to see her alone came very
late in the evening, in the lane at the end

2406
02:48:57,319 --> 02:49:01,819
of the garden - the lane where she used to
meet 'the other one'.

2407
02:49:01,819 --> 02:49:06,890
There was a thunderstorm and they talked under
an umbrella, with lightning flashing all around

2408
02:49:06,890 --> 02:49:08,180
them.

2409
02:49:08,180 --> 02:49:11,960
Their separation was becoming impossible to
bear.

2410
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:18,029
'I would rather be dead,' she said, holding
him, with tears in her eyes.

2411
02:49:18,029 --> 02:49:19,029
'Goodbye!

2412
02:49:19,029 --> 02:49:20,029
Goodbye!

2413
02:49:20,029 --> 02:49:24,100
When shall I see you again?'

2414
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:29,790
They turned back for one last kiss, and she
promised to find some way of seeing him regularly,

2415
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:31,830
at least once a week.

2416
02:49:31,830 --> 02:49:33,360
She was full of hope.

2417
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:36,860
She would soon have some money to play with.

2418
02:49:36,860 --> 02:49:41,210
In fact, she was soon behaving as if she had
all the money in the world.

2419
02:49:41,210 --> 02:49:45,020
She bought a pair of yellow curtains for her
bedroom, which Monsieur Lheureux had told

2420
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:46,949
her were a bargain.

2421
02:49:46,949 --> 02:49:52,250
She had dreams of a carpet and Lheureux, saying
that to want a carpet was not like wishing

2422
02:49:52,250 --> 02:49:55,489
for the moon, helped her to get one.

2423
02:49:55,489 --> 02:49:58,500
She had begun to depend on Lheureux.

2424
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:02,920
She sent for him twenty times a day, and he
immediately stopped what he was doing and

2425
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:05,210
came to see Madame.

2426
02:50:05,210 --> 02:50:08,060
It was a dangerous friendship for Emma.

2427
02:50:08,060 --> 02:50:13,300
It was about this time - around the beginning
of winter - that she suddenly appeared to

2428
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:17,730
develop a tremendous enthusiasm for music.

2429
02:50:17,730 --> 02:50:22,300
One night, while Charles was listening to
her, she began the same piece over again,

2430
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:26,410
stopping four times, finding fault with herself
each time.

2431
02:50:26,410 --> 02:50:31,239
He, never noticing any difference, cried,
'Oh well done!

2432
02:50:31,239 --> 02:50:32,239
Splendid!

2433
02:50:32,239 --> 02:50:33,590
What did you stop for?

2434
02:50:33,590 --> 02:50:34,760
Go on!'

2435
02:50:34,760 --> 02:50:35,930
'Oh, no!

2436
02:50:35,930 --> 02:50:36,939
It's too bad!

2437
02:50:36,939 --> 02:50:41,390
My fingers feel as if they were stiff with
rust!'

2438
02:50:41,390 --> 02:50:43,650
Next day he begged her to play him something
more.

2439
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:47,620
'Oh, well, if you want me to.'

2440
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:50,979
Charles confessed he had heard her play better.

2441
02:50:50,979 --> 02:50:55,939
She kept hitting the wrong notes, and finally
came to a sudden stop.

2442
02:50:55,939 --> 02:50:57,810
'Ah, it's no good!

2443
02:50:57,810 --> 02:51:00,439
I ought to have some lessons, but...'

2444
02:51:00,439 --> 02:51:04,510
She bit her lip and added, 'Twenty francs
a time.

2445
02:51:04,510 --> 02:51:06,369
It's too expensive!'

2446
02:51:06,369 --> 02:51:09,970
'Well, yes... it is...' said Charles.

2447
02:51:09,970 --> 02:51:14,740
'But perhaps it could be managed a bit cheaper.

2448
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:18,819
Sometimes a less well-known artist can be
better than a teacher with a big reputation.'

2449
02:51:18,819 --> 02:51:26,359
'They are not easy to find,' said Emma, and
did not open the piano again - although whenever

2450
02:51:26,359 --> 02:51:36,400
she went near it (if Charles was in the room)
she would say sadly, 'Ah, my poor piano!'

2451
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:41,060
And when she had visitors, she never failed
to tell them she had given up her music and

2452
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:44,760
could not now start again because of their
lack of money.

2453
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:49,670
And they would say what a pity it was, since
she had such a gift.

2454
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:55,689
They even spoke to Charles about it, especially
the pharmacist, saying it was really too bad

2455
02:51:55,689 --> 02:51:56,910
of him.

2456
02:51:56,910 --> 02:51:58,899
'You're making a mistake.

2457
02:51:58,899 --> 02:52:01,920
You should never let a natural gift lie unused.

2458
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:08,080
Besides, my friend, you should remember that
by encouraging your wife to study now, you

2459
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:11,659
will be saving on your child's musical education
later.

2460
02:52:11,659 --> 02:52:16,069
In my opinion, children ought always to be
taught by their own mother.'

2461
02:52:16,069 --> 02:52:20,949
So Charles again came back to this piano question.

2462
02:52:20,949 --> 02:52:25,069
Emma replied bitterly that they might as well
sell it, for all the good it was.

2463
02:52:25,069 --> 02:52:30,890
But to sell this piano, something she had
been so proud of, was an idea that Bovary

2464
02:52:30,890 --> 02:52:33,390
could not accept.

2465
02:52:33,390 --> 02:52:39,890
'Well,' he said, 'if you want a lesson now
and again, it might be possible.'

2466
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:47,290
'Yes,' she replied, 'but it's no good having
lessons unless you take them regularly.'

2467
02:52:47,290 --> 02:52:53,300
That was how she managed to get permission
from her husband to go to Rouen once a week

2468
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:55,650
to see her lover.

2469
02:52:55,650 --> 02:53:02,720
At the end of a month, everyone said that
she had made a lot of progress.

2470
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:05,180
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Debts

2471
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:09,830
Thursday was the day.

2472
02:53:09,830 --> 02:53:14,619
She got up and dressed very quietly, in order
not to disturb Charles, and took the early

2473
02:53:14,619 --> 02:53:20,360
coach to Rouen, arriving just as the city
was beginning to wake up.

2474
02:53:20,360 --> 02:53:25,479
For fear of being seen, she usually avoided
the main streets, going instead down narrow

2475
02:53:25,479 --> 02:53:31,300
lanes and alleys until she reached the rue
Nationale, and turned down a side street,

2476
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:34,260
and yes, there he was.

2477
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:39,320
Leon made no sign, but continued on his way.

2478
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:42,609
She followed him until they came to the hotel.

2479
02:53:42,609 --> 02:53:49,060
In he went and up the stairs, opened the door
of their room and entered; and then how they

2480
02:53:49,060 --> 02:53:50,840
kissed, and then how they talked!

2481
02:53:50,840 --> 02:53:56,319
They spoke of all the worries they had had
during the week, all the things they had done.

2482
02:53:56,319 --> 02:54:01,390
But that was all over now, and they looked
at each other with little sounds of delight,

2483
02:54:01,390 --> 02:54:04,040
and words of tenderness and love.

2484
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:10,220
The bed was large, with red curtains, and
there was nothing so beautiful in the world

2485
02:54:10,220 --> 02:54:16,930
as her dark head and white skin against the
dark red when, with a shy little gesture,

2486
02:54:16,930 --> 02:54:21,409
she put her arms together and hid her face
in her hands.

2487
02:54:21,409 --> 02:54:23,640
How they loved this room.

2488
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:26,430
They had their lunch by the fire on a little
side-table.

2489
02:54:26,430 --> 02:54:33,220
They were so completely involved in each other
that it seemed like being in their own home,

2490
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:36,229
and they dreamed they would continue to live
there always.

2491
02:54:36,229 --> 02:54:42,590
They talked about 'our room', and for the
first time in his life Leon tasted the sweetness

2492
02:54:42,590 --> 02:54:47,590
of female company, a woman's life.

2493
02:54:47,590 --> 02:54:52,659
He knelt on the ground in front of her and,
with his two elbows on her knees, looked at

2494
02:54:52,659 --> 02:54:56,270
her with a smile, leaning his face towards
her.

2495
02:54:56,270 --> 02:55:00,330
And she leaned down to him, and whispered,
'Oh, don't move!

2496
02:55:00,330 --> 02:55:01,609
Don't speak!

2497
02:55:01,609 --> 02:55:03,529
Look at me!

2498
02:55:03,529 --> 02:55:08,779
There is something in your eyes so sweet - it
does me so much good.'

2499
02:55:08,779 --> 02:55:12,979
And she called him 'child': 'Do you love me,
child?'

2500
02:55:12,979 --> 02:55:19,210
And she hardly heard his reply, so wildly
did he press his lips to her mouth.

2501
02:55:19,210 --> 02:55:25,109
At the end of their day she would say, 'Goodbye
till Thursday!

2502
02:55:25,109 --> 02:55:26,229
Thursday!'

2503
02:55:26,229 --> 02:55:31,140
Then suddenly she would seize his head in
both her hands, kiss him quickly on the forehead

2504
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:37,279
and, crying 'Goodbye', run down the stairs.

2505
02:55:37,279 --> 02:55:42,960
Charles would be at home and waiting for her
and, at last, Madame arrived.

2506
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:49,080
She hardly looked at her child and, if dinner
was late, did not criticize the cook.

2507
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:54,630
Often her husband, seeing how pale she was,
asked her if she was feeling ill.

2508
02:55:54,630 --> 02:55:56,979
'No,' said Emma.

2509
02:55:56,979 --> 02:56:01,010
'But,' he answered, 'you seem so strange tonight.'

2510
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:02,500
'Oh, no!

2511
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:03,990
It's nothing.

2512
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:06,239
I'm all right.'

2513
02:56:06,239 --> 02:56:13,529
But her whole life had become a lie, in which
her love for Leon lay hidden from the world.

2514
02:56:13,529 --> 02:56:22,180
Lying became a necessary part of her day,
almost a hobby.

2515
02:56:22,180 --> 02:56:26,980
One day, however, Monsieur Lheureux met her
in Rouen as she was coming out of the Hotel

2516
02:56:26,980 --> 02:56:31,949
de Boulogne with Leon; it gave her a shock,
and she thought he would tell everyone.

2517
02:56:31,949 --> 02:56:35,000
He was not such a fool.

2518
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:41,760
But three days later he came into her room,
shut the door behind him and said, 'I need

2519
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:45,439
some money, and soon.'

2520
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:47,880
She told him she could not let him have any.

2521
02:56:47,880 --> 02:56:53,180
Lheureux reminded her how helpful he had always
been and pulled out of his pocket an account

2522
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:58,290
of goods not paid for - more than two thousand
francs.

2523
02:56:58,290 --> 02:57:00,080
She lowered her head.

2524
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:06,750
'But if you haven't got cash, you've got property,'
and he mentioned a farm near Aumale that Charles

2525
02:57:06,750 --> 02:57:08,710
had inherited from his father.

2526
02:57:08,710 --> 02:57:14,240
Lheureux knew everything - how big the farm
was, how much rent it was worth.

2527
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:20,110
'If I were you,' he said, 'I would pay my
debts, and there would still be some money

2528
02:57:20,110 --> 02:57:21,810
left over.'

2529
02:57:21,810 --> 02:57:27,160
He came back the following week, saying that
after a lot of trouble he had found a buyer

2530
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:31,109
willing to pay four thousand francs for the
farm.

2531
02:57:31,109 --> 02:57:33,800
Emma was happier than she had been for months.

2532
02:57:33,800 --> 02:57:38,840
But Lheureux shook his head and told her how
much richer she would be if she let him manage

2533
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:40,260
these affairs.

2534
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:46,710
Finally he persuaded her to borrow even more
money from him and to sign a series of documents

2535
02:57:46,710 --> 02:57:48,569
which she did not understand.

2536
02:57:48,569 --> 02:57:53,930
He told her this would give her more cash
now - cash she could use to pay her other

2537
02:57:53,930 --> 02:57:57,410
debts and buy some of the little things she
wanted.

2538
02:57:57,410 --> 02:58:03,180
Emma, with her mind full of thoughts of Leon
and what they could do together, did not even

2539
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:09,600
read the papers, but simply signed her name
where Lheureux placed his dirty finger.

2540
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:15,159
With this money in her hands, she felt she
might begin to be free.

2541
02:58:15,159 --> 02:58:18,860
Freedom, however, was a disappointment.

2542
02:58:18,860 --> 02:58:25,590
Despite her hopes, she now found Leon less
pleased to meet her than before, less in love.

2543
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:31,311
Because she had more money in her pocket she
made more demands on him, but his employer

2544
02:58:31,311 --> 02:58:36,470
was worried about his work, and his friends
asked him why they could no longer see him.

2545
02:58:36,470 --> 02:58:42,989
And the more Emma demanded, the less Leon
wanted to give, and while her love, her need

2546
02:58:42,989 --> 02:58:47,399
continued to grow, so did her anger.

2547
02:58:47,399 --> 02:58:55,350
In the end, she brought roses for him from
Yonville and threw them in his face.

2548
02:58:55,350 --> 02:58:57,439
So Emma was not happy.

2549
02:58:57,439 --> 02:59:01,180
Why was there this emptiness in her life?

2550
02:59:01,180 --> 02:59:04,270
Why did whatever she want turn into dust?

2551
02:59:04,270 --> 02:59:13,100
Everything was a lie, every smile hid a bored
yawn; every promise hid a curse.

2552
02:59:13,100 --> 02:59:18,840
To make matters worse, one day a small, red-faced
man came to the house explaining that he came

2553
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:22,060
from a Monsieur Vincart of Rouen.

2554
02:59:22,060 --> 02:59:24,670
He politely handed her a paper.

2555
02:59:24,670 --> 02:59:29,280
It was a bill for seven hundred francs, signed
by her.

2556
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:33,159
Lheureux had sold her bills to a money-lender!

2557
02:59:33,159 --> 02:59:35,300
She sent the servant to fetch him.

2558
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:40,319
He was busy and could not come, and the stranger
asked what reply he should take to Monsieur

2559
02:59:40,319 --> 02:59:41,770
Vincart.

2560
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:45,631
'Well,' said Emma, 'tell him I haven't got
it...

2561
02:59:45,631 --> 02:59:48,050
It will have to be next week.

2562
02:59:48,050 --> 02:59:49,320
Ask him to wait...

2563
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:52,819
Yes, next week, tell him.'

2564
02:59:52,819 --> 02:59:56,689
The man left without another word.

2565
02:59:56,689 --> 03:00:01,949
Next day, at twelve o'clock, a legal document
was handed to her, and the sight of the piece

2566
03:00:01,949 --> 03:00:07,779
of paper with the government stamp on it,
and the name 'Maitre Hareng, Bailiff at Buchy,'

2567
03:00:07,779 --> 03:00:13,330
written on it in big letters, scared her so
much that she ran without a moment's delay

2568
03:00:13,330 --> 03:00:16,130
to Monsieur Lheureux's shop.

2569
03:00:16,130 --> 03:00:18,470
She found him there, tying up a big parcel.

2570
03:00:18,470 --> 03:00:24,569
'What can we do for Madame today?' he asked,
and he showed Madame upstairs to his little

2571
03:00:24,569 --> 03:00:26,140
office.

2572
03:00:26,140 --> 03:00:31,520
'What's the matter?' said Lheureux, seating
himself in his big armchair.

2573
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:33,540
'Look at that.'

2574
03:00:33,540 --> 03:00:36,720
And she showed him the paper.

2575
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:39,770
'Well, what can I do?'

2576
03:00:39,770 --> 03:00:42,560
This made her more angry than frightened.

2577
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:46,140
Hadn't he promised not to sell her bills?

2578
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:50,340
He agreed that he had but added, 'I had no
choice.

2579
03:00:50,340 --> 03:00:52,149
I had a knife at my throat.'

2580
03:00:52,149 --> 03:00:54,980
'What's going to happen now?'

2581
03:00:54,980 --> 03:00:58,729
'Oh, I'll tell you what will happen; that's
easy.

2582
03:00:58,729 --> 03:01:02,880
You go before the judge, you pay or they sell
your things.

2583
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:05,189
It's quite simple.'

2584
03:01:05,189 --> 03:01:10,159
Though Emma wanted to hit him, she asked him
sweetly if there was anything she could do

2585
03:01:10,159 --> 03:01:12,710
to keep this Vincart quiet.

2586
03:01:12,710 --> 03:01:14,060
'Oh, no!

2587
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:16,100
Keep Vincart quiet!

2588
03:01:16,100 --> 03:01:18,979
You don't know much about him, that's clear.

2589
03:01:18,979 --> 03:01:22,050
He's more bloodthirsty than a tiger!'

2590
03:01:22,050 --> 03:01:26,510
Emma cried out that Monsieur Lheureux really
would have to do something.

2591
03:01:26,510 --> 03:01:30,000
'I think I've been pretty good to you!

2592
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:35,190
Look at this,' he said, opening a record book
and running his finger up the page.

2593
03:01:35,190 --> 03:01:39,970
'Here... and again, here... 3 August, two
hundred francs...

2594
03:01:39,970 --> 03:01:42,359
17 June, a hundred and fifty...

2595
03:01:42,359 --> 03:01:47,340
23 March, forty-six.

2596
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:49,350
In April...'

2597
03:01:49,350 --> 03:01:50,590
He stopped.

2598
03:01:50,590 --> 03:01:56,271
'Anyway, I've had enough of these delays,
and that's that!'

2599
03:01:56,271 --> 03:01:57,600
Emma said no more.

2600
03:01:57,600 --> 03:02:02,840
What could she do?

2601
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:06,680
When she went to Rouen, Leon gave her little
comfort.

2602
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:10,760
He had just heard that he was going to be
promoted to chief clerk in his law firm.

2603
03:02:10,760 --> 03:02:13,880
It was time for him to think about his future.

2604
03:02:13,880 --> 03:02:14,880
No more love-making!

2605
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:20,920
Besides, it rather bored him now when Emma
began weeping on his chest, and he had grown

2606
03:02:20,920 --> 03:02:23,040
tired of so much emotion.

2607
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:28,609
Feeling him withdraw from her, she now began
to wonder how she could get rid of him!

2608
03:02:28,609 --> 03:02:34,020
She even began to wish that something terrible
would happen which would force them to separate.

2609
03:02:34,020 --> 03:02:37,729
She stopped her excuse of music lessons, and
her visits to Rouen.

2610
03:02:37,729 --> 03:02:42,819
She stayed in her room, too depressed to pay
attention when more legal demands for money

2611
03:02:42,819 --> 03:02:48,720
came to the house, too depressed to talk to
her husband or her child.

2612
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:53,910
She would have liked to stop living or else
to go on sleeping for ever.

2613
03:02:53,910 --> 03:02:59,750
However, she could not stop the world coming
to her, and one morning, two weeks after the

2614
03:02:59,750 --> 03:03:06,000
first visit by Vincart's man, Felicite brought
her a piece of grey-coloured paper.

2615
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:11,489
She took it and read the complicated legal
language which told her the simple truth that

2616
03:03:11,489 --> 03:03:17,369
within twenty-four hours she had to pay the
total amount of eight thousand francs.

2617
03:03:17,369 --> 03:03:23,760
Lower down, she read the words which told
her that if she did not do this, all her household

2618
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:27,080
goods would be sold!

2619
03:03:27,080 --> 03:03:28,109
What could she do?

2620
03:03:28,109 --> 03:03:29,410
Twenty-four hours!

2621
03:03:29,410 --> 03:03:31,360
That meant tomorrow.

2622
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:35,000
Maybe Lheureux was just trying to frighten
her, that's what it was!

2623
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:36,130
She went to see him.

2624
03:03:36,130 --> 03:03:38,130
'Do you know what's happening?'

2625
03:03:38,130 --> 03:03:39,130
she said.

2626
03:03:39,130 --> 03:03:41,229
'I suppose it's a joke.'

2627
03:03:41,229 --> 03:03:42,229
'It isn't.'

2628
03:03:42,229 --> 03:03:43,500
'What do you mean?'

2629
03:03:43,500 --> 03:03:51,840
He turned to her slowly and then, folding
his arms, said, 'Did you think, my little

2630
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:56,960
lady, that I would keep on supplying you with
goods and money for ever, simply for the love

2631
03:03:56,960 --> 03:03:57,960
of it?

2632
03:03:57,960 --> 03:03:58,960
Be fair!

2633
03:03:58,960 --> 03:04:02,460
I must recover my money one way or the other.

2634
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:08,170
Anyway, it's not me, it's Vincart.'

2635
03:04:08,170 --> 03:04:09,170
'Couldn't you possibly...?'

2636
03:04:09,170 --> 03:04:11,780
'I can't do anything.'

2637
03:04:11,780 --> 03:04:15,739
'But... just look at it like this...'

2638
03:04:15,739 --> 03:04:18,580
And she began to say she had not known...

2639
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:22,150
it had taken her by surprise...

2640
03:04:22,150 --> 03:04:27,060
She begged and prayed, she even put her white
hand on Lheureux's knee.

2641
03:04:27,060 --> 03:04:30,819
'That's enough of that!' he shouted.

2642
03:04:30,819 --> 03:04:33,880
'Anyone would think you were trying to make
love to me.'

2643
03:04:33,880 --> 03:04:37,069
'You horrible man!'

2644
03:04:37,069 --> 03:04:41,479
'Well, who's got a temper?' he said, with
a laugh.

2645
03:04:41,479 --> 03:04:43,560
'I'll tell everyone what you've done.

2646
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:45,320
I'll tell my husband...'

2647
03:04:45,320 --> 03:04:51,909
'All right, but I don't think your husband
will be very pleased when he understands what

2648
03:04:51,909 --> 03:04:54,380
you've been doing!'

2649
03:04:54,380 --> 03:04:57,850
She fell back, as if someone had hit her in
the face.

2650
03:04:57,850 --> 03:05:04,949
And then he went close up to her, saying sweetly,
'It's not very pleasant, I know.

2651
03:05:04,949 --> 03:05:10,880
But, after all, it never killed anybody, and
it seems that it's the only way to make you

2652
03:05:10,880 --> 03:05:12,680
pay me back my money...'

2653
03:05:12,680 --> 03:05:16,770
'But where can I get it?' said Emma.

2654
03:05:16,770 --> 03:05:19,760
'What about all those friends of yours?'

2655
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:26,569
And he gave her a look so searching and so
terrible that she shook with fear.

2656
03:05:26,569 --> 03:05:30,720
'I promise you,' she said.

2657
03:05:30,720 --> 03:05:33,210
'I'll sign any...'

2658
03:05:33,210 --> 03:05:36,239
'I've had enough of you and your signatures!'

2659
03:05:36,239 --> 03:05:38,930
'And I can still sell...'

2660
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:41,990
'Don't be a fool,' he said.

2661
03:05:41,990 --> 03:05:44,290
'You've got nothing left to sell!'

2662
03:05:44,290 --> 03:05:49,659
'But if I brought you three thousand francs,
a quarter, a third, nearly all of it?'

2663
03:05:49,659 --> 03:05:52,529
'No, it's no good.'

2664
03:05:52,529 --> 03:05:55,260
He pushed her gently towards the stairs.

2665
03:05:55,260 --> 03:05:59,939
'I beg you, Monsieur Lheureux, give me a few
days longer!'

2666
03:05:59,939 --> 03:06:01,649
and she burst into tears.

2667
03:06:01,649 --> 03:06:04,840
'Oh look, more tears!'

2668
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:07,220
'But I'm desperate!'

2669
03:06:07,220 --> 03:06:14,960
'I don't care,' he whispered in her ear, so
close she could smell his sour breath, and

2670
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:20,449
then he shut the door.

2671
03:06:20,449 --> 03:06:27,000
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
A Death

2672
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:32,800
She was brave next day, when Maitre Hareng,
the bailiff, accompanied by two witnesses,

2673
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:35,750
came to make a list of the goods to be sold.

2674
03:06:35,750 --> 03:06:42,381
They began with Charles's consulting room,
then went into the kitchen and bedroom.

2675
03:06:42,381 --> 03:06:47,050
They examined her dresses, they searched through
her dressing room - and her whole way of life,

2676
03:06:47,050 --> 03:06:52,930
with all its little secrets, was laid bare,
like a body on an operating table.

2677
03:06:52,930 --> 03:06:58,460
Maitre Hareng, with his black coat buttoned
up to the neck, his white tie and polished

2678
03:06:58,460 --> 03:07:04,899
boots, would say from time to time, 'Pardon
me, Madame; will you allow me?'

2679
03:07:04,899 --> 03:07:09,390
And he frequently made little comments, such
as, 'Charming!

2680
03:07:09,390 --> 03:07:11,180
Very pretty!'

2681
03:07:11,180 --> 03:07:15,290
Then he would make some more notes.

2682
03:07:15,290 --> 03:07:19,120
When they had gone through the rooms, they
went up to the room under the roof.

2683
03:07:19,120 --> 03:07:22,159
She had a desk up there in which she kept
Rodolphe's letters.

2684
03:07:22,159 --> 03:07:24,699
That had to be opened.

2685
03:07:24,699 --> 03:07:30,029
'Ah, letters!' said Maitre Hareng, smiling
politely.

2686
03:07:30,029 --> 03:07:32,279
'But allow me.

2687
03:07:32,279 --> 03:07:36,119
I must make sure the box contains nothing
else.'

2688
03:07:36,119 --> 03:07:40,119
At last they went and Felicite returned.

2689
03:07:40,119 --> 03:07:43,720
Emma had sent her to look out for Charles
and keep him away.

2690
03:07:43,720 --> 03:07:48,319
Charles that evening seemed rather worried.

2691
03:07:48,319 --> 03:07:53,369
She looked at him, then at the curtains, the
chairs, all the things which had made her

2692
03:07:53,369 --> 03:07:57,271
a little happier, but which would now ruin
them.

2693
03:07:57,271 --> 03:08:03,010
The next day, Emma went to Rouen to see if
she could find a way out.

2694
03:08:03,010 --> 03:08:05,910
She visited every banker she knew the name
of.

2695
03:08:05,910 --> 03:08:08,800
Some of them laughed in her face when they
heard her story.

2696
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:10,260
All of them refused.

2697
03:08:10,260 --> 03:08:14,180
At two o'clock, she ran to Leon's office.

2698
03:08:14,180 --> 03:08:16,470
She knocked at the door, but no one came.

2699
03:08:16,470 --> 03:08:19,640
At last Leon himself appeared.

2700
03:08:19,640 --> 03:08:23,069
'I've something I must say to you,' she said.

2701
03:08:23,069 --> 03:08:25,021
She was very pale.

2702
03:08:25,021 --> 03:08:29,270
'Leon,' she said, 'I want you to do something
for me.'

2703
03:08:29,270 --> 03:08:35,920
Then, taking him with her two hands and giving
him a shake, she said, 'Listen, I want eight

2704
03:08:35,920 --> 03:08:37,689
thousand francs.'

2705
03:08:37,689 --> 03:08:38,750
'What?

2706
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:40,869
You're mad!'

2707
03:08:40,869 --> 03:08:42,989
'Not yet.'

2708
03:08:42,989 --> 03:08:48,439
And she told the story of what had happened,
how she had let Lheureux lead her into disaster.

2709
03:08:48,439 --> 03:08:50,270
And Charles knew nothing.

2710
03:08:50,270 --> 03:08:52,029
She must have the money.

2711
03:08:52,029 --> 03:08:54,460
'How do you expect me...?'

2712
03:08:54,460 --> 03:08:58,090
And her lover would do nothing to help her.

2713
03:08:58,090 --> 03:09:00,949
She had nowhere to turn to.

2714
03:09:00,949 --> 03:09:04,250
'What must be must be!'

2715
03:09:04,250 --> 03:09:11,020
she said to herself.

2716
03:09:11,020 --> 03:09:14,170
She was woken at nine the next morning by
voices in the square.

2717
03:09:14,170 --> 03:09:20,000
There was a crowd of people outside, all trying
to read a big piece of paper stuck to the

2718
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,739
wall of her house.

2719
03:09:21,739 --> 03:09:22,739
'Madame!

2720
03:09:22,739 --> 03:09:23,739
Madame!'

2721
03:09:23,739 --> 03:09:24,739
cried Felicite, rushing in.

2722
03:09:24,739 --> 03:09:27,270
'It's a terrible shame!'

2723
03:09:27,270 --> 03:09:33,140
And the poor girl held out a yellow paper
which she had just torn off the front door.

2724
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:37,300
Emma read that all her furniture was to be
sold.

2725
03:09:37,300 --> 03:09:40,909
They looked at each other in silence.

2726
03:09:40,909 --> 03:09:45,079
Servant and mistress had no secrets from one
another.

2727
03:09:45,079 --> 03:09:53,790
'If I were you, Madame,' sighed Felicite at
last, 'I would go and see Monsieur Guillaumin.'

2728
03:09:53,790 --> 03:09:54,960
'You would?'

2729
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:56,729
'Yes, you go.

2730
03:09:56,729 --> 03:09:59,960
That's the right thing to do.'

2731
03:09:59,960 --> 03:10:06,189
She dressed and, in order not to be seen (there
were always a lot of people in the square),

2732
03:10:06,189 --> 03:10:09,199
she took the path by the river.

2733
03:10:09,199 --> 03:10:16,579
'Monsieur,' she said, after she was let into
the lawyer's dining room, 'I want to ask you...'

2734
03:10:16,579 --> 03:10:19,310
And she told him her situation.

2735
03:10:19,310 --> 03:10:22,750
Maitre Guillaumin knew all about it.

2736
03:10:22,750 --> 03:10:29,409
In fact, he was a secret friend of Lheureux's,
and knew the story better than she did herself.

2737
03:10:29,409 --> 03:10:33,890
As he listened, he smiled a strange smile.

2738
03:10:33,890 --> 03:10:38,530
When she asked him for help with the money
that was being demanded, he said how sad he

2739
03:10:38,530 --> 03:10:41,270
was that she had never come to him before.

2740
03:10:41,270 --> 03:10:47,520
Then he put out his hand and took hold of
hers, and kissed it greedily, playing with

2741
03:10:47,520 --> 03:10:52,480
her fingers and looking in her face with his
colourless eyes.

2742
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:57,210
She felt his breath on her cheek and could
not bear it.

2743
03:10:57,210 --> 03:10:59,190
She jumped to her feet.

2744
03:10:59,190 --> 03:11:01,899
'Monsieur,' she said, 'I am waiting.'

2745
03:11:01,899 --> 03:11:06,359
'What for?' said the lawyer, suddenly going
as white as a sheet.

2746
03:11:06,359 --> 03:11:07,689
'This money.'

2747
03:11:07,689 --> 03:11:08,689
'But...'

2748
03:11:08,689 --> 03:11:16,090
Then, giving in to a desire he could not resist,
he said, 'Very well, yes!

2749
03:11:16,090 --> 03:11:17,250
You can have your money!'

2750
03:11:17,250 --> 03:11:22,940
And he dragged himself along on his knees
towards her, shouting, 'For God's sake, stay!

2751
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:24,200
I love you!'

2752
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:26,720
He took her by the waist.

2753
03:11:26,720 --> 03:11:31,660
Madame Bovary fell back with a terrible expression
on her face, crying, 'I know I have fallen,

2754
03:11:31,660 --> 03:11:35,020
Monsieur, but I am not to be sold.'

2755
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:37,890
And she turned and ran from the house.

2756
03:11:37,890 --> 03:11:42,010
Felicite was waiting for her on the doorstep.

2757
03:11:42,010 --> 03:11:43,310
'Well?'

2758
03:11:43,310 --> 03:11:44,489
she asked.

2759
03:11:44,489 --> 03:11:47,829
'No!' said Emma.

2760
03:11:47,829 --> 03:11:51,720
And for the next quarter of an hour they went
together through the names of all the people

2761
03:11:51,720 --> 03:11:54,670
in Yonville who might perhaps help her.

2762
03:11:54,670 --> 03:12:00,450
But every time Felicite mentioned a name Emma
answered, 'Do you really think so?

2763
03:12:00,450 --> 03:12:02,689
Oh, no, I'm sure they wouldn't.'

2764
03:12:02,689 --> 03:12:06,590
'And the Doctor will be here in a minute or
two.'

2765
03:12:06,590 --> 03:12:09,930
'Yes, I know that...

2766
03:12:09,930 --> 03:12:12,430
Leave me alone.'

2767
03:12:12,430 --> 03:12:13,430
Rodolphe!

2768
03:12:13,430 --> 03:12:14,920
She had to see Rodolphe.

2769
03:12:14,920 --> 03:12:19,680
He would help her, but what should she say,
how should she begin?

2770
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:24,920
Emma entered the park by the side gate, and
walked to the house.

2771
03:12:24,920 --> 03:12:28,050
She climbed the stairs and went to his room.

2772
03:12:28,050 --> 03:12:32,090
He was sitting in front of the fire, with
his feet up on the fireplace, just lighting

2773
03:12:32,090 --> 03:12:33,350
a pipe.

2774
03:12:33,350 --> 03:12:34,489
'Hello!

2775
03:12:34,489 --> 03:12:38,619
Is that you?' he said, getting up quickly.

2776
03:12:38,619 --> 03:12:40,710
'Yes, it's me.

2777
03:12:40,710 --> 03:12:44,159
Rodolphe, I want to ask your advice.'

2778
03:12:44,159 --> 03:12:48,260
'You haven't changed, you are as charming
as ever.'

2779
03:12:48,260 --> 03:12:52,550
'Ah,' she answered bitterly, 'sad charms.

2780
03:12:52,550 --> 03:12:54,890
You said goodbye to them easily enough!

2781
03:12:54,890 --> 03:12:56,450
Oh, Rodolphe!'

2782
03:12:56,450 --> 03:12:57,450
she sighed.

2783
03:12:57,450 --> 03:12:58,790
'If you only knew...

2784
03:12:58,790 --> 03:13:00,980
I loved you so!'

2785
03:13:00,980 --> 03:13:03,569
'You've been crying!' he said.

2786
03:13:03,569 --> 03:13:05,500
'Why is that?'

2787
03:13:05,500 --> 03:13:07,529
Now she began to weep uncontrollably.

2788
03:13:07,529 --> 03:13:10,590
'I am ruined, Rodolphe!

2789
03:13:10,590 --> 03:13:17,470
I want you to lend me three thousand francs.'

2790
03:13:17,470 --> 03:13:19,010
'But... but...'

2791
03:13:19,010 --> 03:13:24,970
Hurrying over her words, she told him her
story, to which he listened carefully.

2792
03:13:24,970 --> 03:13:31,800
When she had finished, he looked sadly at
her and replied, very calmly, 'I haven't got

2793
03:13:31,800 --> 03:13:32,800
it, dear lady.'

2794
03:13:32,800 --> 03:13:36,140
It was no lie.

2795
03:13:36,140 --> 03:13:40,399
If he had had it, he would have given it to
her.

2796
03:13:40,399 --> 03:13:43,290
She stood for a few minutes looking at him.

2797
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:45,970
'You haven't got it?

2798
03:13:45,970 --> 03:13:48,850
Haven't got it?'

2799
03:13:48,850 --> 03:13:55,680
She repeated it several times, then she went
out.

2800
03:13:55,680 --> 03:14:00,120
The walls seemed to be shaking, and she felt
that the ceiling would fall on her.

2801
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:06,119
When she was outside, she felt a little better,
but all her memories, all her ideas seemed

2802
03:14:06,119 --> 03:14:09,329
to fill her head and burst in a single flash.

2803
03:14:09,329 --> 03:14:12,000
She felt she was going mad.

2804
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:17,010
Night was falling, and dark birds were flying
into the trees.

2805
03:14:17,010 --> 03:14:24,729
The sky seemed full of balls of fire, falling
slowly to earth, turning and turning.

2806
03:14:24,729 --> 03:14:26,779
What could she do?

2807
03:14:26,779 --> 03:14:29,810
How could she face the world?

2808
03:14:29,810 --> 03:14:34,960
She went running down the hill, through the
market place and into the pharmacist's shop.

2809
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:40,950
The door was open and no one was there, though
she could hear Justin, the assistant, talking

2810
03:14:40,950 --> 03:14:42,100
to Monsieur Homais.

2811
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:47,060
She entered the passage where the laboratory
door was.

2812
03:14:47,060 --> 03:14:51,210
On the wall hung a key labelled 'Room 6'.

2813
03:14:51,210 --> 03:14:56,620
It turned in the lock, and she went straight
over and reached up to the third shelf, knocking

2814
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:59,840
over a small bowl which had stood beside it.

2815
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:02,300
'Is anyone there?

2816
03:15:02,300 --> 03:15:04,449
Who is that?'

2817
03:15:04,449 --> 03:15:06,550
She could hear Justin walking down the corridor.

2818
03:15:06,550 --> 03:15:08,790
She must be quicker.

2819
03:15:08,790 --> 03:15:13,489
She read the labels, her eyes desperately
searching for one particular bottle, a bottle

2820
03:15:13,489 --> 03:15:16,729
which might give her a way out of this impossible
situation.

2821
03:15:16,729 --> 03:15:20,800
'Is there anyone there?'

2822
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:26,699
She took down a blue jar with a small, hand-written
label on it, pulled off the lid, and pushed

2823
03:15:26,699 --> 03:15:28,930
her hand inside.

2824
03:15:28,930 --> 03:15:34,189
She took it out full of a white powder which
she began to eat then and there.

2825
03:15:34,189 --> 03:15:36,890
Justin ran into the room.

2826
03:15:36,890 --> 03:15:37,890
'Stop!'

2827
03:15:37,890 --> 03:15:40,369
cried the boy, terrified, throwing himself
on her.

2828
03:15:40,369 --> 03:15:42,399
'Be quiet, they'll come!

2829
03:15:42,399 --> 03:15:46,800
They will blame your master for not locking
his room.'

2830
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:48,229
Then she left.

2831
03:15:48,229 --> 03:15:55,470
They could do nothing to her now, and she
felt a great peace in her heart.

2832
03:15:55,470 --> 03:15:59,979
Charles had come back to the house just after
Emma left it to find Rodolphe.

2833
03:15:59,979 --> 03:16:01,779
He did not know what to do.

2834
03:16:01,779 --> 03:16:08,439
He sent Felicite to the Homais', the Tuvaches',
Lheureux's, the Lion d'Or, everywhere.

2835
03:16:08,439 --> 03:16:13,790
Whenever anxiety for his wife lifted for a
moment, he saw his own life ruined, his money

2836
03:16:13,790 --> 03:16:16,890
gone, Berthe's future destroyed.

2837
03:16:16,890 --> 03:16:18,069
How?

2838
03:16:18,069 --> 03:16:19,250
Why?

2839
03:16:19,250 --> 03:16:22,790
Not a word.

2840
03:16:22,790 --> 03:16:25,439
He waited until six o'clock in the evening.

2841
03:16:25,439 --> 03:16:31,220
Then, unable to stand it any longer, he went
out along the road for a couple of kilometres,

2842
03:16:31,220 --> 03:16:36,739
saw no one, waited, and then came back again.

2843
03:16:36,739 --> 03:16:39,060
She had come home.

2844
03:16:39,060 --> 03:16:42,729
'What was the matter?

2845
03:16:42,729 --> 03:16:43,729
Why?

2846
03:16:43,729 --> 03:16:46,420
Tell me all about it.'

2847
03:16:46,420 --> 03:16:52,479
She sat down at her desk and wrote a letter,
which she slowly closed, adding the date and

2848
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:53,590
the hour.

2849
03:16:53,590 --> 03:16:59,250
Then she said, 'You will read that tomorrow.

2850
03:16:59,250 --> 03:17:03,729
Until then, I beg you, do not ask me a single
question...

2851
03:17:03,729 --> 03:17:06,079
No, not one!'

2852
03:17:06,079 --> 03:17:07,180
'But...'

2853
03:17:07,180 --> 03:17:10,489
'Oh, leave me!'

2854
03:17:10,489 --> 03:17:14,710
And she lay down on her bed and seemed to
fall asleep.

2855
03:17:14,710 --> 03:17:18,720
She felt a bitter taste in her mouth, and
it woke her up.

2856
03:17:18,720 --> 03:17:22,699
She caught sight of Charles, and shut her
eyes again.

2857
03:17:22,699 --> 03:17:26,260
She tried to keep awake, wondering whether
she had any pain.

2858
03:17:26,260 --> 03:17:29,800
But no, nothing yet.

2859
03:17:29,800 --> 03:17:33,590
She could hear the clock, the sound of the
fire.

2860
03:17:33,590 --> 03:17:37,830
Charles was standing by the bed, and she heard
the sound of his breathing.

2861
03:17:37,830 --> 03:17:42,489
'Ah, it's nothing very much - dying!'

2862
03:17:42,489 --> 03:17:43,819
she thought.

2863
03:17:43,819 --> 03:17:50,460
'I shall just fall asleep, and it will all
be over.'

2864
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:53,430
She drank some water and turned her face to
the wall.

2865
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:58,930
But there was still that horrible taste of
ink in her mouth.

2866
03:17:58,930 --> 03:18:03,869
'I'm thirsty... oh, I'm so thirsty!'

2867
03:18:03,869 --> 03:18:04,869
she sighed.

2868
03:18:04,869 --> 03:18:11,159
'What can it be?' said Charles, bringing her
a glass of water.

2869
03:18:11,159 --> 03:18:12,310
'It's nothing...

2870
03:18:12,310 --> 03:18:13,750
Open the window...

2871
03:18:13,750 --> 03:18:16,340
I can't breathe.'

2872
03:18:16,340 --> 03:18:21,319
And she began to vomit so suddenly that she
hardly had time to take her handkerchief from

2873
03:18:21,319 --> 03:18:22,910
under her pillow.

2874
03:18:22,910 --> 03:18:25,010
He questioned her.

2875
03:18:25,010 --> 03:18:26,410
She did not answer.

2876
03:18:26,410 --> 03:18:31,830
She kept perfectly still, for fear the slightest
movement would make her vomit again.

2877
03:18:31,830 --> 03:18:37,010
And she began to feel an icy coldness rising
from her feet to her heart.

2878
03:18:37,010 --> 03:18:40,579
'Ah, it's beginning now!'

2879
03:18:40,579 --> 03:18:41,619
she whispered.

2880
03:18:41,619 --> 03:18:45,410
'What did you say?'

2881
03:18:45,410 --> 03:18:51,020
She kept moving her head gently from side
to side, opening and shutting her jaws, as

2882
03:18:51,020 --> 03:18:54,430
if she had something very heavy on her tongue.

2883
03:18:54,430 --> 03:18:58,460
At eight o'clock the vomiting began again.

2884
03:18:58,460 --> 03:19:04,460
Charles, examining the basin, noticed something
white at the bottom.

2885
03:19:04,460 --> 03:19:10,119
'That's extraordinary, most unusual!' he said.

2886
03:19:10,119 --> 03:19:15,869
'No, no, you're wrong,' she replied in a strong
voice.

2887
03:19:15,869 --> 03:19:21,140
Then, very lightly, he passed his hand over
her stomach.

2888
03:19:21,140 --> 03:19:23,210
She gave a horrible scream.

2889
03:19:23,210 --> 03:19:25,399
He stepped back, terrified.

2890
03:19:25,399 --> 03:19:30,390
Then she began to shake and became paler than
the sheet that she was holding.

2891
03:19:30,390 --> 03:19:32,140
Her heartbeat was irregular.

2892
03:19:32,140 --> 03:19:34,990
There were drops of sweat on her face.

2893
03:19:34,990 --> 03:19:40,930
Her eyes stared without seeing, and she answered
every question with a shake of her head.

2894
03:19:40,930 --> 03:19:43,529
She even smiled two or three times.

2895
03:19:43,529 --> 03:19:46,029
Gradually her breathing became noisier.

2896
03:19:46,029 --> 03:19:47,980
Then she started to scream.

2897
03:19:47,980 --> 03:19:50,740
'Oh, God, it's terrible!'

2898
03:19:50,740 --> 03:19:53,600
He threw himself on his knees at her bedside.

2899
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:55,340
'Tell me!

2900
03:19:55,340 --> 03:19:56,830
What have you eaten?

2901
03:19:56,830 --> 03:19:58,770
For God's sake, speak!'

2902
03:19:58,770 --> 03:20:03,619
And he looked at her with a tenderness in
his eyes that she had never seen before.

2903
03:20:03,619 --> 03:20:06,540
'All right - over there...

2904
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:07,540
there!'

2905
03:20:07,540 --> 03:20:08,699
she said weakly.

2906
03:20:08,699 --> 03:20:17,029
He ran to the writing-table, tore open the
letter, and read aloud: 'Let no one be blamed...'

2907
03:20:17,029 --> 03:20:21,970
He stopped, passed his hand across his eyes
and then read on.

2908
03:20:21,970 --> 03:20:23,020
'What!...

2909
03:20:23,020 --> 03:20:24,069
Help!

2910
03:20:24,069 --> 03:20:26,170
Help me!'

2911
03:20:26,170 --> 03:20:35,399
And all he could say was the word, 'Poisoned,
poisoned!'

2912
03:20:35,399 --> 03:20:41,290
Felicite ran to Monsieur Homais' shop and
he came back as soon as he heard what was

2913
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:42,290
the matter.

2914
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:45,310
'Be calm,' said the pharmacist.

2915
03:20:45,310 --> 03:20:48,020
'What is the poison?'

2916
03:20:48,020 --> 03:20:53,069
Charles showed him the letter and the pharmacist
realized there was little to be done.

2917
03:20:53,069 --> 03:20:57,100
Emma saw the two of them and looked at Charles.

2918
03:20:57,100 --> 03:21:03,229
'Don't cry,' she said, 'I will not be here
to worry you much longer.'

2919
03:21:03,229 --> 03:21:06,569
'Why did you do it?

2920
03:21:06,569 --> 03:21:08,829
Who made you do it?'

2921
03:21:08,829 --> 03:21:15,590
And she replied, 'It had to be, my dear.'

2922
03:21:15,590 --> 03:21:18,250
'Weren't you happy?

2923
03:21:18,250 --> 03:21:19,430
Was it my fault?

2924
03:21:19,430 --> 03:21:21,279
I did everything I could.'

2925
03:21:21,279 --> 03:21:23,899
'Yes, you did...

2926
03:21:23,899 --> 03:21:28,279
You are kind, so kind.'

2927
03:21:28,279 --> 03:21:32,460
And she passed her fingers slowly through
his hair.

2928
03:21:32,460 --> 03:21:38,350
'Bring the little one to me,' she said, raising
herself on her elbow.

2929
03:21:38,350 --> 03:21:45,880
'The pain isn't getting any worse, is it?'
asked Charles.

2930
03:21:45,880 --> 03:21:46,880
'No!'

2931
03:21:46,880 --> 03:21:51,070
The child came in, in her long nightdress.

2932
03:21:51,070 --> 03:21:54,860
She looked thoughtful and not yet fully awake.

2933
03:21:54,860 --> 03:22:00,330
She opened big, wondering eyes when she saw
the room, and the bright candles.

2934
03:22:00,330 --> 03:22:04,750
'Oh, Mummy, how big your eyes are!

2935
03:22:04,750 --> 03:22:06,630
How pale you are!

2936
03:22:06,630 --> 03:22:10,790
And your face is all sweaty!'

2937
03:22:10,790 --> 03:22:12,840
Her mother was staring at her.

2938
03:22:12,840 --> 03:22:18,260
'I'm frightened,' cried the little one.

2939
03:22:18,260 --> 03:22:23,149
Emma took her hand and tried to kiss it; she
struggled to free herself.

2940
03:22:23,149 --> 03:22:24,930
'That's enough!

2941
03:22:24,930 --> 03:22:27,590
Take her away!'

2942
03:22:27,590 --> 03:22:29,359
cried Charles.

2943
03:22:29,359 --> 03:22:35,100
After that Emma seemed a little better, but
then she began to vomit blood, her limbs became

2944
03:22:35,100 --> 03:22:40,329
stiff, her body was covered with brown patches,
and her heartbeat raced.

2945
03:22:40,329 --> 03:22:42,590
Then she began to scream again.

2946
03:22:42,590 --> 03:22:46,710
She cursed the poison, she begged it to hurry
up and finish its work.

2947
03:22:46,710 --> 03:22:50,020
She pushed away everything that Charles tried
to make her drink.

2948
03:22:50,020 --> 03:22:54,590
He was standing stiffly by the bed, his whole
body shaking from head to foot.

2949
03:22:54,590 --> 03:22:57,479
Felicite ran from one end of the room to the
other.

2950
03:22:57,479 --> 03:23:03,529
There was nothing to be done except to call
the priest.

2951
03:23:03,529 --> 03:23:09,109
When he came, Emma was lying with her chin
sunk on her breast; her eyes were staring

2952
03:23:09,109 --> 03:23:12,420
and her poor hands picked at the sheets.

2953
03:23:12,420 --> 03:23:19,750
Pale as death, with eyes like burning coals,
Charles - not crying now - was standing facing

2954
03:23:19,750 --> 03:23:27,970
her at the foot of the bed, while the priest,
resting on one knee, was whispering his prayers.

2955
03:23:27,970 --> 03:23:32,949
Slowly she turned her head and suddenly, as
she saw the priest kneeling beside her, a

2956
03:23:32,949 --> 03:23:35,280
look of joy came over her face.

2957
03:23:35,280 --> 03:23:40,720
The priest rose from his knees to show her
the cross, and she leant forward and pressed

2958
03:23:40,720 --> 03:23:43,480
her lips to the body of the Man-God.

2959
03:23:43,480 --> 03:23:49,020
It was as if she kissed the figure on the
cross with more love than she had ever given

2960
03:23:49,020 --> 03:23:52,609
any person during her life.

2961
03:23:52,609 --> 03:23:58,100
She then fell back on to the bed, and they
hurried to her side.

2962
03:23:58,100 --> 03:24:02,880
Her life had ended.

2963
03:24:02,880 --> 03:24:07,750
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Endings

2964
03:24:07,750 --> 03:24:14,310
Death always comes as a shock, however much
it has been expected.

2965
03:24:14,310 --> 03:24:21,500
So when, at last, Charles saw her lying there
so still, he threw himself on her, weeping.

2966
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:24,609
'That's right,' said the pharmacist.

2967
03:24:24,609 --> 03:24:27,170
'Let nature have her way.

2968
03:24:27,170 --> 03:24:29,560
You'll feel much better!'

2969
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:34,270
Later, funeral arrangements had to be made.

2970
03:24:34,270 --> 03:24:36,580
Charles thought carefully about these and
wrote:

2971
03:24:36,580 --> 03:24:43,510
I want her to be buried in her wedding dress,
with white shoes and white flowers, and her

2972
03:24:43,510 --> 03:24:46,060
hair loose over her shoulders.

2973
03:24:46,060 --> 03:24:49,890
She should be covered with a large piece of
green silk.

2974
03:24:49,890 --> 03:24:51,010
These are my wishes.

2975
03:24:51,010 --> 03:24:53,189
Make sure that they are carried out.

2976
03:24:53,189 --> 03:25:02,170
The gentlemen were surprised at Charles's
ideas, and Monsieur Homais spoke to him.

2977
03:25:02,170 --> 03:25:07,449
'It seems to us,' he said, 'that silk is a
little expensive...'

2978
03:25:07,449 --> 03:25:09,859
'That's none of your business!'

2979
03:25:09,859 --> 03:25:11,050
shouted Charles.

2980
03:25:11,050 --> 03:25:12,939
'Leave me alone!

2981
03:25:12,939 --> 03:25:16,220
You didn't love her, so just get out of my
sight!'

2982
03:25:16,220 --> 03:25:23,040
That night, Charles, Homais and the priest
sat beside Emma's body.

2983
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:26,100
She was lying with her head leaning over her
right shoulder.

2984
03:25:26,100 --> 03:25:31,729
The corner of her mouth, which was open, looked
like a black hole at the bottom of her face;

2985
03:25:31,729 --> 03:25:35,479
her two thumbs were held tightly in her hands.

2986
03:25:35,479 --> 03:25:40,520
The sheet that covered her lay quite flat
from her breasts down to her knees, rising

2987
03:25:40,520 --> 03:25:46,060
up again at the tips of her toes, and it seemed
to Charles as if an enormous weight was pressing

2988
03:25:46,060 --> 03:25:47,930
down on her.

2989
03:25:47,930 --> 03:25:52,640
Early in the morning, Madame Bovary senior
arrived.

2990
03:25:52,640 --> 03:25:57,439
Charles, as he kissed her, again broke down
and cried.

2991
03:25:57,439 --> 03:26:02,810
Like the pharmacist, she criticized him about
the funeral expenses, but he became so angry

2992
03:26:02,810 --> 03:26:05,649
that she grew quiet.

2993
03:26:05,649 --> 03:26:07,960
Charles stayed by himself all afternoon.

2994
03:26:07,960 --> 03:26:11,779
Berthe had been taken over to Madame Homais.

2995
03:26:11,779 --> 03:26:17,040
In the evening, various people came in to
see him and to express their regrets.

2996
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:22,569
He stood up and shook hands, but he could
not say anything, and each newcomer sat down

2997
03:26:22,569 --> 03:26:26,270
with the rest of the group, in a big circle
round the fireplace.

2998
03:26:26,270 --> 03:26:32,630
They all looked at the floor with serious
expressions on their faces, and although everyone

2999
03:26:32,630 --> 03:26:37,359
was bored, no one got up to go.

3000
03:26:37,359 --> 03:26:43,329
Upstairs Felicite, Madame Lefrancois and Madame
Bovary senior were standing around Emma, busily

3001
03:26:43,329 --> 03:26:45,560
finishing their task of dressing her.

3002
03:26:45,560 --> 03:26:49,150
'Oh, my poor mistress!'

3003
03:26:49,150 --> 03:26:50,950
wept Felicite.

3004
03:26:50,950 --> 03:26:54,550
'My poor, poor mistress!'

3005
03:26:54,550 --> 03:26:59,250
'Just look at her!' said the landlady of the
Lion d'Or.

3006
03:26:59,250 --> 03:27:03,819
'How pretty she looks even now!'

3007
03:27:03,819 --> 03:27:06,880
Then they all bent over to put the flowers
on her hair.

3008
03:27:06,880 --> 03:27:12,680
They had to lift her head a little, and as
they did so, a stream of black liquid poured

3009
03:27:12,680 --> 03:27:13,680
from her mouth.

3010
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:15,430
'Oh, my God!

3011
03:27:15,430 --> 03:27:16,619
The dress!

3012
03:27:16,619 --> 03:27:17,819
Take care!'

3013
03:27:17,819 --> 03:27:19,760
cried Madame Lefrancois.

3014
03:27:19,760 --> 03:27:25,279
Charles had to listen to the sound of hammers
on wood as she was put into her last little

3015
03:27:25,279 --> 03:27:26,279
home.

3016
03:27:26,279 --> 03:27:32,900
Four men carried her to the door, the house
was thrown open, and all the people of Yonville

3017
03:27:32,900 --> 03:27:33,900
crowded near.

3018
03:27:33,900 --> 03:27:40,109
Emma's father, Farmer Rouault, arrived as
they were bringing her out, and fell unconscious

3019
03:27:40,109 --> 03:27:45,260
in the market place when he saw the funeral
carriage.

3020
03:27:45,260 --> 03:27:49,920
At the church Charles tried to think about
the few times when they had been happy together

3021
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:53,970
- or when, at least, he had been happy with
her.

3022
03:27:53,970 --> 03:27:59,640
But remembering that she was there, underneath
that green cloth, his heart was filled with

3023
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:03,250
black anger against God and against the world.

3024
03:28:03,250 --> 03:28:08,909
They sang, they went down on their knees,
they got up again; there seemed to be no end

3025
03:28:08,909 --> 03:28:10,149
to it all.

3026
03:28:10,149 --> 03:28:14,479
He remembered how once, in the early days,
they had gone to church together.

3027
03:28:14,479 --> 03:28:21,290
They had sat on the other side, on the right,
against the wall.

3028
03:28:21,290 --> 03:28:27,010
Outside the church Charles walked in front,
holding himself very upright.

3029
03:28:27,010 --> 03:28:32,920
Six men carried Emma's body, and the priest
followed saying the prayers for the dead.

3030
03:28:32,920 --> 03:28:39,149
His voice was carried over the fields, rising
and falling on the wind.

3031
03:28:39,149 --> 03:28:44,370
Sometimes a sudden turn in the path hid them
from sight, but always the great silver cross

3032
03:28:44,370 --> 03:28:46,880
rose high among the trees.

3033
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:54,100
The women followed, dressed in black, and
each in her hand carried a tall lighted candle.

3034
03:28:54,100 --> 03:29:00,010
Charles recognized every garden as he passed,
and remembered how often, on mornings like

3035
03:29:00,010 --> 03:29:06,010
this one, he had come away from one of them
and set out for home and Emma.

3036
03:29:06,010 --> 03:29:10,300
Now they had arrived at the place where her
grave had been dug.

3037
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:15,250
The people stood around, and all the time
the priest was speaking, the red earth that

3038
03:29:15,250 --> 03:29:21,420
had been piled beside the grave ran noiselessly
down the slope into the dark hole.

3039
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:26,649
Then, when the four ropes were in position,
they lowered her into the grave.

3040
03:29:26,649 --> 03:29:33,020
Charles watched the wooden box go down until,
at last, it arrived at the bottom and the

3041
03:29:33,020 --> 03:29:35,689
ropes were pulled up again.

3042
03:29:35,689 --> 03:29:40,340
The priest took the spade held out to him
by his assistant and pushed the earth into

3043
03:29:40,340 --> 03:29:48,869
the grave, then Charles sank down on his knees,
throwing in handfuls of earth as he cried,

3044
03:29:48,869 --> 03:29:49,869
'Goodbye!'

3045
03:29:49,869 --> 03:29:54,990
He sent her kisses, and dragged himself to
the edge of the grave, wanting to lie with

3046
03:29:54,990 --> 03:29:56,270
her.

3047
03:29:56,270 --> 03:30:04,550
They led him away, and he soon grew calm again,
perhaps feeling, like all the others, a sense

3048
03:30:04,550 --> 03:30:08,319
of relief that it was now all over.

3049
03:30:08,319 --> 03:30:13,109
As the crowd walked back to the village, they
talked about her death and what a terrible

3050
03:30:13,109 --> 03:30:19,180
thing it was - especially Lheureux, who had
made an effort to be there.

3051
03:30:19,180 --> 03:30:22,270
'Poor little lady!

3052
03:30:22,270 --> 03:30:26,100
What a terrible thing for her husband!'

3053
03:30:26,100 --> 03:30:30,700
Emma's father insisted on going straight back
to Les Bertaux, saying that he could not sleep

3054
03:30:30,700 --> 03:30:32,079
in that house.

3055
03:30:32,079 --> 03:30:34,420
He would not even see his little grandchild.

3056
03:30:34,420 --> 03:30:36,439
'No, no!

3057
03:30:36,439 --> 03:30:38,790
I couldn't bear the pain of it.

3058
03:30:38,790 --> 03:30:40,020
Goodbye, then.

3059
03:30:40,020 --> 03:30:47,989
You're a good man,' and, pointing at his thigh,
'I shan't forget that leg, not as long as

3060
03:30:47,989 --> 03:30:49,960
I live.

3061
03:30:49,960 --> 03:30:55,260
You'll always get a bird from me at Christmas,
don't you worry.'

3062
03:30:55,260 --> 03:31:01,560
When he reached the top of the hill he turned
again, just as, years ago, he had turned and

3063
03:31:01,560 --> 03:31:07,660
looked back along the Saint-Victor road when
she had left him to go with her husband.

3064
03:31:07,660 --> 03:31:11,430
The windows in the village were all on fire
in the light of the evening sun.

3065
03:31:11,430 --> 03:31:18,069
He put up his hand to shade his eyes and far
away, on the horizon, he saw the place where

3066
03:31:18,069 --> 03:31:25,260
she lay, with the trees, here and there, dark
among the white stones.

3067
03:31:25,260 --> 03:31:27,630
Then he went on his way.

3068
03:31:27,630 --> 03:31:34,729
Next day, Charles had Berthe brought home
from the nurse.

3069
03:31:34,729 --> 03:31:39,029
She asked for her mummy and they told her
that she had gone away, that she would bring

3070
03:31:39,029 --> 03:31:40,859
her back some toys.

3071
03:31:40,859 --> 03:31:47,000
Berthe spoke of her again many times, but
as the days went by she stopped thinking about

3072
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:52,720
her and Charles could not bear the child's
happy laugh.

3073
03:31:52,720 --> 03:31:57,300
Life continued around Charles, but it had
lost its meaning.

3074
03:31:57,300 --> 03:32:02,370
When Madame Dupuis wrote to him to tell him
of the 'marriage of her son, Monsieur Leon

3075
03:32:02,370 --> 03:32:08,510
Dupuis, a lawyer in Yvetot, to Mademoiselle
Leocadie Leboeuf, of Bondeville', Charles

3076
03:32:08,510 --> 03:32:15,430
wrote: 'How delighted my poor wife would have
been!', but he did not really care.

3077
03:32:15,430 --> 03:32:19,790
Besides, before long, his money troubles began
again.

3078
03:32:19,790 --> 03:32:25,080
Monsieur Lheureux's Vincart returned once
again with his demands.

3079
03:32:25,080 --> 03:32:28,540
Now everyone tried to profit from Charles's
loss.

3080
03:32:28,540 --> 03:32:33,450
A music teacher in Rouen sent in a bill for
six lessons, although Emma had never been

3081
03:32:33,450 --> 03:32:39,920
to her once; a Madame Rollet demanded payment
for delivering letters to Rouen.

3082
03:32:39,920 --> 03:32:45,189
And day by day Charles had to sell the silver,
piece by piece; then he got rid of the best

3083
03:32:45,189 --> 03:32:46,409
furniture.

3084
03:32:46,409 --> 03:32:50,479
All the rooms were robbed of their contents
- except for one.

3085
03:32:50,479 --> 03:32:55,380
Her room, her bedroom, was left as it had
always been.

3086
03:32:55,380 --> 03:32:58,290
When he had had his dinner, Charles went up
there.

3087
03:32:58,290 --> 03:33:03,630
He pulled the round table in front of the
fire, moved her chair nearer, and then sat

3088
03:33:03,630 --> 03:33:05,220
down facing it.

3089
03:33:05,220 --> 03:33:09,859
A candle would be burning, and Berthe would
be sitting near him, busy with her painting

3090
03:33:09,859 --> 03:33:11,250
book.

3091
03:33:11,250 --> 03:33:17,470
Despite these efforts to keep Emma's memory
alive, Bovary realized with sorrow that her

3092
03:33:17,470 --> 03:33:20,090
face was fading from his memory.

3093
03:33:20,090 --> 03:33:24,920
But every night he dreamed of her and it was
always the same dream.

3094
03:33:24,920 --> 03:33:32,359
He moved close to touch her, but just as he
was taking her in his arms, she fell to dust.

3095
03:33:32,359 --> 03:33:35,310
And he was still in debt.

3096
03:33:35,310 --> 03:33:39,470
Lheureux refused to wait any longer and Charles
did not know what to do.

3097
03:33:39,470 --> 03:33:43,540
At last, he decided he had to look in Emma's
desk.

3098
03:33:43,540 --> 03:33:49,771
There, instead of an answer to his problems,
he found Leon's letters.

3099
03:33:49,771 --> 03:33:55,649
He read them all, to the last line, then searched
through every other piece of furniture, opening

3100
03:33:55,649 --> 03:33:58,920
every drawer, emptying every box.

3101
03:33:58,920 --> 03:34:04,790
In this way he also discovered a picture of
Rodolphe - staring at him from a mountain

3102
03:34:04,790 --> 03:34:07,430
of love letters.

3103
03:34:07,430 --> 03:34:12,330
Now people were shocked to see him so depressed.

3104
03:34:12,330 --> 03:34:16,829
He never went out or had visitors; he even
refused to go and see his patients.

3105
03:34:16,829 --> 03:34:21,840
The only times he went out now were when he
took his little girl by the hand, and they

3106
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:25,600
went together to the cemetery.

3107
03:34:25,600 --> 03:34:30,430
One day, when he had gone to the market at
Argueil to sell his horse - his last possession

3108
03:34:30,430 --> 03:34:32,449
- he met Rodolphe.

3109
03:34:32,449 --> 03:34:35,200
They both turned pale.

3110
03:34:35,200 --> 03:34:43,949
Rodolphe, who, when Emma died, had only sent
his card, tried to give a few apologies.

3111
03:34:43,949 --> 03:34:48,640
Then he grew braver, and invited Charles to
have a bottle of beer with him at the inn.

3112
03:34:48,640 --> 03:34:55,329
As they walked on, he talked about farming,
the price of land, trying to avoid any uncomfortable

3113
03:34:55,329 --> 03:34:57,369
subjects.

3114
03:34:57,369 --> 03:35:04,180
Charles was not listening, Rodolphe noticed,
and he anxiously watched his companion's face.

3115
03:35:04,180 --> 03:35:11,000
At last Charles said, 'I'm not angry with
you.'

3116
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:15,819
Rodolphe remained silent and Charles, with
his head in his hands, repeated in a flat

3117
03:35:15,819 --> 03:35:23,630
voice, a voice full of endless sorrow, 'No,
I'm not angry with you now.'

3118
03:35:23,630 --> 03:35:31,110
Then he said a great thing, the only great
thing he had ever said: 'Fate is to blame!'

3119
03:35:31,110 --> 03:35:37,250
Rodolphe, who had controlled the direction
of this particular fate for some time, thought

3120
03:35:37,250 --> 03:35:42,619
this was rather a weak, even ridiculous response
from a man in Bovary's position.

3121
03:35:42,619 --> 03:35:49,109
Next day, Charles went out and sat down on
the seat in the garden.

3122
03:35:49,109 --> 03:35:54,590
The sunlight came through the leaves, making
shadows on the path, the perfume of the roses

3123
03:35:54,590 --> 03:36:01,130
filled the air, the sky was blue, and bees
flew from one open flower to the next.

3124
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:07,040
Charles felt disturbed, like a young man with
an aching heart.

3125
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:13,369
At seven o'clock little Berthe, who had not
seen him that afternoon, came to fetch him

3126
03:36:13,369 --> 03:36:14,449
in to dinner.

3127
03:36:14,449 --> 03:36:22,120
His head was leaning back against the wall,
his eyes were shut, his mouth was open, and

3128
03:36:22,120 --> 03:36:25,880
his right hand was holding some long dark
hair.

3129
03:36:25,880 --> 03:36:29,000
'Come on, daddy!'

3130
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:30,400
she said.

3131
03:36:30,400 --> 03:36:36,430
And, thinking he was only playing, she gave
him a little push.

3132
03:36:36,430 --> 03:36:39,300
He fell to the ground.

3133
03:36:39,300 --> 03:36:42,810
He was dead.

3134
03:36:42,810 --> 03:36:48,790
When everything had been sold, just twelve
francs remained, enough to pay for Mademoiselle

3135
03:36:48,790 --> 03:36:52,640
Bovary's journey to her grandmother's house.

3136
03:36:52,640 --> 03:36:55,630
That lady died the same year.

3137
03:36:55,630 --> 03:37:01,580
As Farmer Rouault was by then too unwell to
look after Berthe, she was taken in by an

3138
03:37:01,580 --> 03:37:02,580
aunt.

3139
03:37:02,580 --> 03:37:08,569
She is there still, but the aunt is poor and
sends the little girl to earn her living in

3140
03:37:08,569 --> 03:37:09,560
a cotton mill.
